## DeepCircuitX — Quick Guide

This repo hosts a sample subset of DeepCircuitX for easy local browsing and LLM experimentation.
- Contains: source RTL (Chip, IP, Module, RISC‑V), intermediate annotations, SFT samples, and eval prompts.
- Note: training JSONs are short samples (~5k lines each); annotations include a few representative types per hierarchy (≈5 each).

### Contents
- `Hierarchy/` — RTL organized by level; many modules include `_<name>_/intermediate_comment/` with specs/Q&A/module blurbs.
- `train_data_samples/` — `Training-CodeComp.json`, `Training-CodeGen.json`, `Training-CodeUnderstand.json` (instruction, input, output).
- `eval_data/` — standardized prompts for comment generation, code generation, and completion.

### Dataset counts for RTL code tasks
| Task | IP | Module | RISC‑V | Chip | Total |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| RTL Code Understanding | 6,386 | 14,499 | 1,348 | 3,922 | 26,155 |

### Notes
- Treat `.v`/`.sv` as ground truth; intermediate annotations are for training prep (no chain‑of‑thought stored).
- SFT schema: `{ instruction, input, output }`.
