Module name: bcd_adder_8bit_tb

Module specification: The "bcd_adder_8bit_tb" is a Verilog testbench module designed to test the functionality of an 8-bit Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) adder. The module simulates the addition of two 8-bit BCD numbers by considering the carry-input as well, and examines the resultant sum and carry output. Input ports include two sets of 4-bit signals (A1, A0, B1, B0) representing two 8-bit BCD numbers split into higher and lower nibbles, and a carry-in bit 'cin'. Output ports consist of two 4-bit outputs (S1, S0) representing higher and lower nibbles of the resultant sum, a carry-out 'cout', and an additional wire 'wire6' whose specific purpose is primarily for testing or debugging but not explicitly detailed in the code. Internal signals are defined as 'wire6', 'cout', 'S0', and 'S1', where 'wire6' appears to be used for monitoring specific states, and 'cout', 'S0', 'S1' are the outputs of the module under test (bcd_adder_8bit). The testbench initializes the input values, sets up necessary monitoring and debugging configurations, and the entire simulation behavior is monitored and recorded to ensure correct functionality, which concludes upon a predefined simulation time, and results are saved in a waveform file "bcd_adder_8bit.vcd".
