    "module": "The bcd_adder_4bit_tb module serves as a testbench for verifying the bcd_adder_4bit, which performs addition of two 4-bit BCD numbers. It initializes inputs (in1, in2, carry_in), connects these to the bcd_adder_4bit instance, and monitors outputs (sum, carry_out, wire6) using the $monitor function. Outputs are visualized via a VCD file, ensuring functional integrity through pre-defined simulation times and input scenarios."
