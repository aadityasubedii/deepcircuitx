Module name: bcd_adder_4bit.
Module specification: The 'bcd_adder_4bit' module is designed for binary-coded decimal (BCD) addition, handling two 4-bit inputs, `in1` and `in2`, plus a single-bit carry input `cin`. This module generates a 4-bit BCD sum (`sum`), a carry-out signal (`cout`), and a debug signal (`wire6`) as outputs. Internal signals within the module include `wire1`, which temporarily holds the binary sum of `in1` and `in2`; `wire2` that stores the carry generated from this addition; `wire3` and `wire4`, both used for intermediate logic operations to detect if the sum exceeds 9; `wire5` combines these logic conditions; and `wire10` which determines the adjustment value for BCD correction. The module incorporates two instances of a `parallel_adder` for binary addition, the first computes the initial sum and carry, and the second adjusts the sum for BCD compliance if necessary, indicated by correction condition `wire6`. Logical operations facilitated by AND and OR gates assess and signal the need for sum correction, ensuring the output adheres to BCD standards. Thus, this module efficiently combines binary arithmetic operations and correction logic to maintain BCD conformity in digital systems.
