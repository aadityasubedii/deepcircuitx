    "module": "The 'bcd_adder_4bit' module performs BCD addition of two 4-bit inputs using an initial binary addition followed by a correction process if the sum exceeds 9. It employs two instances of a 'parallel_adder' for the initial sum and BCD correction, along with logical and arithmetic operations to determine and adjust the final sum and carry out, ensuring compliance with BCD arithmetic standards."
