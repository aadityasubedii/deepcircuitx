It uses a combination of parallel binary addition followed by correction logic to ensure BCD compatibility in the output. Firstly, the binary sum and carry of `in1` and `in2` are computed using the `parallel_adder` module and are stored in `wire1` and `wire2` respectively. Then, correction logic is applied to adjust the sum if it exceeds the BCD maximum of 9. This logic uses logical operations (AND, OR) to determine if the correction is needed (represented by `wire6`). If correction is necessary, it adjusts the binary sum using another instance of the `parallel_adder` to produce the final BCD sum and carry out (`sum`, `cout`). This ensures accurate BCD arithmetic in the output."
