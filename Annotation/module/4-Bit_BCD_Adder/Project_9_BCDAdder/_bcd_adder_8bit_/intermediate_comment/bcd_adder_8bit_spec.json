    "spec": "Module name: bcd_adder_8bit. \nModule specification: The `bcd_adder_8bit` module is designed to perform addition on two 8-bit Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) numbers. It accepts inputs A1, A0 (higher and lower 4-bits of the first BCD number), B1, B0 (higher and lower 4-bits of the second BCD number), and a carry-in bit `cin`, which is primarily used for cascading multiple such adders. The outputs of the module include S0 and S1, representing the lower and higher 4-bits of the resultant BCD sum, a carry-out `cout` for cascading, and an internal signal `wire6` which appears to be exposed unintentionally. Internal signals such as `wire1` and `wire20` store the intermediate sums from the addition of lower and higher nibbles of BCD numbers, respectively. Carry signals `wire2` and `wire7` emerge from these additions. Logical operations determine the presence of carries that should be accounted for due to the BCD format, influencing correction bits applied in subsequent addition operations through signals like `wire10` and `wire30`. The module incorporates several functional blocks: `parallel_adder` units to perform binary addition of four-bit vectors, logical gates to prepare carry and correction bits, and assign statements to structure the propagation and application of these correction terms to ensure the results conform to BCD encoding standards. Each parallel adder, instantiated twice for lower and higher nibble operations, receives correction terms and calculates the final summed outputs with the consideration of carries generated during the process. The module's structure ensures compatibility and correctness in chained BCD addition scenarios, such as in calculators or other digital computation systems requiring direct BCD manipulations.",

It takes two 8-bit BCD inputs, split into two 4-bit segments (A1, A0 and B1, B0), along with a carry-in input 'cin'. The module uses a series of parallel adders and logical operations to compute the sum of these BCD numbers, accounting for BCD-specific adjustments such as if an output exceeds 9.
