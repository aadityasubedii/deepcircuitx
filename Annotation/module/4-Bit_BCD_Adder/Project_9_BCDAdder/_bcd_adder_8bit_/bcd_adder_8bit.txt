The `bcd_adder_8bit` module performs 8-bit BCD addition, processing two BCD numbers split into two 4-bit segments and a carry-in, producing a BCD sum and a carry-out. It implements this through parallel adders for initial sum calculations, augmented by logical gates and correction assignments to handle BCD-specific carries and ensure correct format results, supporting cascade configurations effectively.
