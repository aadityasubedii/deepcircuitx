    "module": "The `compre` module performs arithmetic and logical operations on two 4-bit inputs, `i` and `a`, employing a 2-bit selector `S` to control operation modes. It uses internal D flip-flops and multiplexers configured through user-defined `USR` blocks to manage data transfer and computation, outputting both intermediate 4-bit results `s` and `c`, and a final 5-bit result `f`. The module's functionality is executed based on the clock `clk` and reset `rst` signals, enabling sequential data processing and synchronous reset control."
