Module name: add4. Module specification: The 'add4' module is designed to perform a 4-bit addition using the 2-bit and 1-bit addition modules named 'add2' and 'add1' respectively. It accepts two 4-bit wide inputs, 'a' and 'b', and outputs a 4-bit wide result 'sum'. The input ports 'a' and 'b' are each 4 bits ([3:0]) and are the binary numbers to be added. The output port 'sumâ€™ also is 4 bits wide ([3:0]) and stores the result of the 4-bit addition. Internally, 'add4' uses a wire 'w2' which acts as a carry-out from the first instance of 'add2' and as a carry-in for the second instance of 'add2'. This propagation of carry allows correct summation across all four bits. The module's code is organized into three main sections: 'add4' as the top module, and 'add2' and 'add1' as submodules. 'add2' is instantiated twice within 'add4', first to add the lower two bits of 'a' and 'b' with an initial carry of 0, and then to add the upper two bits with the carry forwarded by 'w2'. 'add2' itself consists of two instances of 'add1', handling addition at the bit level. This hierarchical structure ensures that each bit of the operands correctly contributes to the final sum considering binary addition rules, demonstrating a chain addition process from the least significant to the most significant bits.
