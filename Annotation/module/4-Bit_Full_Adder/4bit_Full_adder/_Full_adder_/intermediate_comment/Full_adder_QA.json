The two inputs are `a` and `b`, each 4 bits wide. The module add2 is instantiated twice, first for the lower two bits and then for the upper two bits of the operands. The carry output from the first instance of add2 is used as the carry input for the second instance, enabling chained addition which sums all four bits correctly. The sum of the operations is stored in the 4-bit output `sum`."
