    "module": "The `add4` module performs a 4-bit addition of two input numbers 'a' and 'b', outputting the result in 'sum'. It implements this by using two instances of the `add2` module to add pairs of bits sequentially, first the lower and then the upper pairs, with the carry-out from the first addition chain-fed as the carry-in to the second. Each `add2` utilizes two `add1` instances, incrementally processing carries and binary addition for accurate results."
