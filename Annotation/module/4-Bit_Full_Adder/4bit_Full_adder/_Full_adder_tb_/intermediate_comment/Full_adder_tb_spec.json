    "spec": "Module name: Full_adder_tb. Module specification: The Full_adder_tb is a Verilog testbench designed specifically for validating the functionality of a 4-bit adder module named 'add4'. It provides a simulation environment where inputs 'a' and 'b', both 4-bit registers, are systematically modified to test the adder's response. The output, 'sum', is a 4-bit wire that represents the result of the addition operation performed by the 'add4' module. Internally, the module 'add4' is instantiated as 't', linking the input operands 'a' and 'b' to the output 'sum'. This setup helps in demonstrating and validating the correct computational operation of the adder under various conditions. The testbench includes initial blocks that utilize procedural statements to set test conditions: it starts with fixed values for 'a' and 'b', followed by random values in a repeated loop. The $monitor command is used to track and display the values of 'a', 'b', and 'sum' during simulation, and waveform data is recorded using $dumpfile and $dumpvars for further analysis. This thorough and systematic testing ensures that the 'add4' module performs as expected across a range of input values.",

The testbench sets up a simulation environment where 'a' and 'b' are driven with specific values and random values in sequence, and the output 'sum' is monitored.
