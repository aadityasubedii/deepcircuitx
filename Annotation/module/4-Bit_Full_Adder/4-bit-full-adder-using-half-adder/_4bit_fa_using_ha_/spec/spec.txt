Module name: four_bit_adder. Module specification: The "four_bit_adder" module is designed to compute the sum of two 4-bit binary numbers, incorporating an incoming carry bit and producing a resulting 4-bit sum and a carry-out bit. The inputs include two 4-bit numbers 'a' and 'b', and a single-bit carry-in 'cin'. The outputs are a 4-bit sum 'sum' and a carry-out 'cout'. Internally, the module uses four instances of the "fa" submodule, a full-adder unit designed to add two individual bits and a carry. The internal signal array 'c[3:1]' serves as intermediate carry bits generated between stages of addition â€“ 'c[1]' from the least significant bit, propagating up to 'c[3]', which feeds into the most significant bit addition. Each "fa" block computes the sum and carry for a pair of bits from 'a' and 'b' starting from the least significant bit, using additional internal signals within "fa" such as 'sum1' for the intermediate sum, 'c1' for the carry from adding 'a' and 'b', and 'c2' as the carry including the input carry. The "four_bit_adder" leverages Verilog functions hasum and hacarry for bitwise sum (XOR operation) and carry (AND operation) calculations, respectively. The testbench module verifies the adder's functionality by inputting test cases and observing the outputs using a simulation monitor, ensuring robust operation across various input conditions.
