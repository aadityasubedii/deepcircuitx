The four_bit_adder module adds two 4-bit binary numbers and an input carry, producing a 4-bit sum and a carry out. It implements this by using four instances of the fa submodule to perform bit-wise full addition, where each fa instance handles addition for a bit pair from the input numbers along with the propagated carry from the lower bit, using internal signals to calculate intermediate results and the final carry-out through a series of logical operations defined in hasum and hacarry functions.
