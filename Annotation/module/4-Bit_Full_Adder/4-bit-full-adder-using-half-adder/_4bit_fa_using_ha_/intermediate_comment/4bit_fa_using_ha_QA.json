It uses multiple instances of the \"fa\" submodule to achieve bit-wise addition with carry propagation.\n\n- The fa module represents a full-adder, which takes two single-bit inputs and a carry in, then outputs a single-bit sum and carry out. It uses internal functions hasum and hacarry to compute the sum and carry respectively. hasum calculates the binary sum without considering the carry (i.e., exclusive OR), while hacarry determines the carry generated by the addition (i.e., AND operation).\n\n- The testbench module is designed for simulating and verifying the functionality of the four_bit_adder module. It sets different test inputs for the adder and monitors the outputs using a test instance named \"dut\" of the four_bit_adder. The test sequences cover different scenarios to ensure the module operates correctly under various conditions."
