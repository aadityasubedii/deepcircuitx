Module name: Test_maxAbsValueCir.

Module specification: The Test_maxAbsValueCir module is a Verilog testbench designed primarily to test the functionality of different variations of the `maxAbsValueCir` circuit, which calculates maximum or absolute values based on the inputs w1, w2, and w3. It does not explicitly define output ports but utilizes internal wire signals out, out_eq, and out_net to collect results from the instantiated submodule circuits `maxAbsValueCir`, `maxAbsValueCir_eq`, and `maxAbsValueCir_net`, respectively. The module receives inputs through ports `global_reset`, `w1`, `w2`, `w3`, and `MW`. `global_reset` is used for resetting internal states, `w1`, `w2`, and `w3` are 4-bit inputs to the circuits being tested, and `MW` likely controls memory operations in conjunction with the `memModule`. Internal signals include `MHMH_dataBus`, a 12-bit register that stores bitwise information from w1, w2, and w3, and `addBus`, a 32-bit register used as an address counter in memory operations. The module's code is divided into sections for initializing controls, updating data bus and address upon input changes, and interfacing with memory through a parameterized instance of `memModule`. This arrangement underscores the moduleâ€™s role in evaluating circuit computations and handling data storage and manipulation efficiently within a simulated test environment.
