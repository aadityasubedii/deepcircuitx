The main functionality of this test module encompasses the setting up and testing of these computations across three variations of the circuit (`maxAbsValueCir`, `maxAbsValueCir_eq`, and `maxAbsValueCir_net`). The module uses a register array `MHMH_dataBus` to store bits from w1, w2, and w3, indicating potential data handling or transformation. Additionally, it manages an `addBus` which is a 32-bit register initialized to zero and incremented upon changes in w1, w2, and w3, possibly for address calculations in testing. The `memModule` instance inside suggests that the results or the states from these calculations might be stored or further processed in memory-related operations, controlled by MW and the global reset signal."

The values from these inputs are processed and compared to determine some form of maximum or absolute value.\n- `MW`: This signal might be used to control write operations within the `memModule`, potentially enabling or disabling the recording or updating of memory at certain times based on the test sequences or conditions.\n\nOutput ports: None explicitly declared in the module interface.\nExplanation: This module does not declare any traditional output ports at its top level. However, it interacts with internal submodules that produce outputs (`out`, `out_eq`, and `out_net`). These outputs, though not directly accessible as top-level outputs, are likely used within the context of the test module for further analysis, display, or memory storage. These outputs from internal instances serve pivotal roles in computation verification and memory mapping inside the module, supporting the testing framework for the `maxAbsValueCir` circuits."
