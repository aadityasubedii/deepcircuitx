Module name: cirTest. 
Module specification: The `cirTest` module is primarily designed to test the functionality of a submodule named `absolutemax`, which calculates the maximum value among three 4-bit inputs. The module has three input ports, `wi1`, `wi2`, and `wi3`, each 4-bit wide, intended to represent integers in 2's complement format; these ports supply test data to the `absolutemax` module. The output from the `absolutemax` module is represented by the 4-bit wide output port `outi`, which displays the greatest value among the inputs. Internally, `cirTest` uses registers `wi1`, `wi2`, and `wi3` to hold the input values and a wire `outi` to carry the output. The module includes an initial block that applies test values to the inputs after a delay of 20 time units and concludes the simulation at 80 time units. This setup aids in assessing the operational correctness of the `absolutemax` submodule by observing its output on applying specific test vectors.
