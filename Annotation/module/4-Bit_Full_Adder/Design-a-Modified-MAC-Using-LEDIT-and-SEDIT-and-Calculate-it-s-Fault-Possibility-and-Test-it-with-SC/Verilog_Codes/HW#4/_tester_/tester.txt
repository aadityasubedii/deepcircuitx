The `cirTest` module tests the `absolutemax` submodule by determining the maximum of three 4-bit inputs, acting as a testing framework. It initializes `wi1`, `wi2`, and `wi3` with predefined test values, delays actions to allow observation, and then uses the `absolutemax` to output the greatest value to `outi`. The process halts simulation at a specified time, showcasing the functional verification of `absolutemax`.
