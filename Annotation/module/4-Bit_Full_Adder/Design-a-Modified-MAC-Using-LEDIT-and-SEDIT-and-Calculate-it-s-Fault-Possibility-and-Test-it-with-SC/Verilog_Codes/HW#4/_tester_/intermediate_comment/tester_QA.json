The purpose of the `cirTest` module is to determine the maximum value among three 4-bit inputs (wi1, wi2, wi3) using the `absolutemax` module, and output this maximum value to a 4-bit output (outi). The test involves setting initial values to wi1, wi2, and wi3 after a delay of 20 time units and then stopping the simulation after a total of 80 time units. The functionality of `absolutemax` is not defined in the provided code, but typically, such a module would compare the inputs and output the greatest among them."
