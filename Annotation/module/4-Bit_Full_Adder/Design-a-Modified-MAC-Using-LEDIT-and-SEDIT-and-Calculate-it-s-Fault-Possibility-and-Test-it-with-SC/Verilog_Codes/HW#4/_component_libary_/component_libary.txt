The `and_n` module performs an N-input AND operation by sequentially ANDing inputs through cascading two-input gates stored in an internal wire array `mwire`. The operation begins by ANDing the first two inputs and proceeds through the array via generation block, culminating in a buffered output to ensure defined output drive characteristics.
