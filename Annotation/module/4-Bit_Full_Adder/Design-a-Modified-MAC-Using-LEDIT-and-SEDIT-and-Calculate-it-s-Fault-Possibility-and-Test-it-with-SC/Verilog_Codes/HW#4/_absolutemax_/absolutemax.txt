The 'absolutemax' module calculates the input (in1, in2, or in3) with the highest absolute value among three 4-bit signed integers, ignoring the sign. It stores absolute versions of each input in internal registers (a1, a2, a3), determined via the two's complement method if the input is negative, based on the most significant bit. The module then compares these absolute values and outputs the original value of the input with the greatest magnitude through the output port 'o'.
