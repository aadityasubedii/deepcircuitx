It first converts any negative input values to their absolute values (using two's complement method if the most significant bit, indicating the sign, is 1). Then, it compares these absolute values and outputs the original input that corresponds to the largest absolute value. This process makes it useful for applications where finding the maximum magnitude, irrespective of the sign, is required."
