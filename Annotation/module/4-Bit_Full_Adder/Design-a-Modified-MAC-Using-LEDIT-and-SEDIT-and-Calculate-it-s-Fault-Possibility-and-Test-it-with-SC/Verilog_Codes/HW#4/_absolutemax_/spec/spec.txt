Module name: absolutemax. Module specification: The 'absolutemax' module is designed to effectively determine the input (from three provided 4-bit signed integers, in1, in2, and in3) which has the greatest magnitude, disregarding its sign. Each of these inputs is considered on its respective ports namely in1, in2, and in3. The output, delivered on a 4-bit output port 'o', is the original value of the input with the highest absolute magnitude. Internally, three 4-bit registers, a1, a2, and a3, store the absolute values of in1, in2, and in3 respectively. The conversion process checks the most significant bit (sign bit) of each input and uses the two's complement method to convert negatives into positives. Comparisons are conducted between these absolute values to decide which original input has the maximum magnitude; this selected input's value is then presented on the 'o' output port. The module functions through an always block sensitive to changes in in1, in2, or in3, ensuring that the internal logic and output 'o' update adequately with any modification in inputs, thereby providing continuous real-time evaluation of the absolute maximum.
