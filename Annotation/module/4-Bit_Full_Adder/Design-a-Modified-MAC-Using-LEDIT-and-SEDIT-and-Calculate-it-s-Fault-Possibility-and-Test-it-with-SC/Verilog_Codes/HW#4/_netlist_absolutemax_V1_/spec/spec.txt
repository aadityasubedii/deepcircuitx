Module name: maxAbsValueCir_net. Module specification: This module is designed to find the maximum absolute value among three 4-bit input vectors (w1, w2, w3). It uses a complex network of logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, XNOR, NOT) and fanout structures to compare and process the input values. The module has three 4-bit input ports (w1[0:3], w2[0:3], w3[0:3]) representing signed numbers, and one 4-bit output port (out[0:3]) that provides the maximum absolute value result. Internally, the module utilizes numerous wires (maxAbsValueCir_wire_1 to maxAbsValueCir_wire_135) and fanout wires for intermediate calculations and signal distribution. The code is structured into several sections: input/output declarations, wire declarations, fan
