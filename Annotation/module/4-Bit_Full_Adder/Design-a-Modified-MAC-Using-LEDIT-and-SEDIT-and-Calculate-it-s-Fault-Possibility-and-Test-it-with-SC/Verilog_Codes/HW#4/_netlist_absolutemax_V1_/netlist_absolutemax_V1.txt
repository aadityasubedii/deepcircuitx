This module finds the maximum absolute value among three 4-bit input vectors (w1, w2, w3). It employs a complex network of logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, XNOR, NOT) and fanout structures to compare and process the inputs. The implementation uses multiple intermediate wires for calculations, with fanout modules to distribute signals. The module performs parallel comparisons and decision-making logic, utilizing a series of logical operations to determine the final 4-bit output representing the maximum absolute value.
