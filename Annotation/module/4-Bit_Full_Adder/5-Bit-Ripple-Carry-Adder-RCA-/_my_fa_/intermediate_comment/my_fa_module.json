    "module": "The 'my_fa' module is designed to function as a full adder, intended to compute the sum and carry-out of two input bits and a carry-in bit. Currently, the module only defines input and output ports including 'a', 'b', 'cin' (input bits and carry-in) and 'sum', 'co' (sum and carry-out), without implementing the actual addition logic, leaving it as a functional template for further development."
