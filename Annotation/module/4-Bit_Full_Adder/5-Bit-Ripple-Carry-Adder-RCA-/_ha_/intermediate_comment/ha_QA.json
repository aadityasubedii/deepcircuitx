A half-adder takes two binary digits as input, represented by 'a' and 'b', and produces two outputs, 'sum' and 'carry out (co)'. The 'sum' output is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 'a' and 'b', which calculates the sum without carrying. The 'carry out' output is the result of the bitwise AND operation between 'a' and 'b', indicating if there is a carry to be added to the next highest bit. This module is fundamental in building arithmetic circuits, facilitating basic addition operations."

The 'sum' is calculated using a bitwise XOR operation on the inputs 'a' and 'b', which provides the result of adding two bits excluding the carry. The 'co' (carry out) is obtained by performing a bitwise AND on the inputs 'a' and 'b', indicating whether there is a carry generated that needs to be added to the next higher bit in a multi-bit addition scenario."

The 'sum' is obtained by performing a bitwise XOR operation on the input signals, and 'co' is derived from a bitwise AND operation.
