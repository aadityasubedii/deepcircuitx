Module name: rcarcarca. Module specification: The 'rcarcarca' module is designed to function as a 5-bit ripple-carry adder, which efficiently sums two 5-bit binary numbers 'a' and 'b'. It features input ports [a, b], which are both 5-bit vectors used to supply the binary numbers to be added. The output of the module includes a 5-bit sum 'sum' and a carry-out 'co' which indicates an overflow condition if the result exceeds what can be held within 5 bits. Internally, the module uses a 4-bit wire 'co_s' to propagate carry between the stages of addition. The implementation begins with a half-adder 'my_ha0' for the least significant bits and uses four subsequent full-adders ('my_fa_1' to 'my_fa_4') to process the remaining bits. Each full-adder takes a bit from each input number and a carry-in from the previous stage, providing a sum bit and a carry-out. The last carry-out serves as the moduleâ€™s overflow indicator. By cascading half and full adders in such a manner and wisely using propagation delay through the carry, this module ensures correct sum and carry outputs for binary addition.
