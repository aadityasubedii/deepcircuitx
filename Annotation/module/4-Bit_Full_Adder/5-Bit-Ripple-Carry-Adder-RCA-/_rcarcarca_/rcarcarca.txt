The rcarcarca module implements a 5-bit ripple-carry adder to sum two 5-bit inputs, 'a' and 'b', yielding a 5-bit sum 'sum' and an overflow indicator 'co'. It utilizes a half-adder for the least significant bit and four full-adders for the remaining bits, passing the carry from one stage to the next through an internal 4-bit wire 'co_s', which ensures correct summation and overflow detection.
