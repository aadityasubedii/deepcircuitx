A full adder takes two input bits, n1 and n2, and a carry-in bit, c_in, and produces a sum output, sum_out, and a carry-out output, c_out. In the design:\n- The `xor` gates are used to calculate the sum of the inputs and the carry-in.\n- The `and` gates determine the conditions under which a carry is generated from the inputs and the intermediate sum.\n- The `or` gate computes the final carry-out by combining the outputs from the `and` gates.\nThis module provides essential functionality typical in arithmetic operations and digital circuits, allowing for bit-wise addition with carry propagation."
