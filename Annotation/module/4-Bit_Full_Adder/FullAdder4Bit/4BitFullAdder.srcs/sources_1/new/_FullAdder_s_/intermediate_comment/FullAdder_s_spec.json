    "spec": "Module name: FullAdder_s. Module specification: The FullAdder_s module is designed to function as a single-bit full adder in digital circuits, handling the addition of two binary inputs and a carry-in to produce both a sum output and a carry-out. It accepts three input ports: n1 and n2, which are the binary digits to be added, and c_in, representing the carry from a previous addition. The outputs include sum_out, providing the result of the addition, and c_out, indicating the carry-out to a subsequent higher-order bit. Internally, the module uses three signals: sum1, a wire carrying the intermediate XOR result of n1 and n2, which is considered the preliminary sum before the carry-in is added; c1, another wire representing the AND output of n1 and n2, showcasing a direct carry generation condition; and c2, which records the AND output between sum1 and c_in for determining another carry-out condition. The design incorporates fundamental logic gates operations, where two XOR gates calculate the final sum_out from sum1 and c_in, two AND gates determine the situations influencing carry-out via c1 and c2, and an OR gate finalizes c_out by combining c1 and c2 outputs. This structure allows the FullAdder_s module to efficiently participate in larger arithmetic operations and digital circuits by facilitating accurate bit-wise addition and carry propagation.",

A full adder takes two input bits, n1 and n2, and a carry-in bit, c_in, and produces a sum output, sum_out, and a carry-out output, c_out.
