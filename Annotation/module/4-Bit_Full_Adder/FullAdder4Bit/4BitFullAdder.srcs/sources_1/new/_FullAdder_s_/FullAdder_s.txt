The FullAdder_s module performs single-bit addition, handling two input bits and a carry-in to generate a sum and a carry-out. It leverages XOR gates for computing the sum, AND gates to determine possible carry conditions, and an OR gate to finalize the carry-out, enabling proper bit-wise addition and carry propagation in arithmetic circuits.
