    "module": "The `fullAdder4Bit_s` module performs 4-bit binary addition, taking `n1`, `n2`, and `c_in` as inputs and providing the sum and carry-out as outputs. It uses four instantiated `FullAdder_s` sub-modules, each handling one bit of addition, with internal carry wires (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`) propagating carries between them from least to most significant bits."
