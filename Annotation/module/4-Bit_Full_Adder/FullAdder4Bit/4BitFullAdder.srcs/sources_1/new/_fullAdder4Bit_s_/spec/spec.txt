Module name: fullAdder4Bit_s. Module specification: The `fullAdder4Bit_s` module is designed to perform 4-bit binary addition. It accepts two 4-bit vectors, `n1` and `n2`, and a carry-in bit `c_in`, performing addition and producing a 4-bit sum `sum_out` and a carry-out bit `c_out`. The inputs include: `[3:0] n1` and `[3:0] n2`, which represent the two binary numbers to be added, and `c_in`, the initial carry-in bit that contributes to the least significant bit. The outputs are: `[3:0] sum_out`, the resulting sum of `n1` and `n2` factoring in `c_in`, and `c_out`, which serves as the overflow indicator or carry-out from the most significant bit. Internally, the module uses wires `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` to carry overflows between each bit addition, facilitating correct computation across the 4-bit addition. The code is structured into specific blocks where each `FullAdder_s` instance (`FA0` to `FA3`) calculates the sum for a corresponding bit pair from `n1` and `n2`, starting from the least significant bit and moving towards the most significant, using the preceding block's carry-out as the next block's carry-in. This modular approach efficiently cascades the binary addition across all four bits.
