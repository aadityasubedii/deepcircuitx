It takes two 4-bit input numbers, `n1` and `n2`, along with a carry-in input `c_in`. The module outputs a 4-bit sum, `sum_out`, and a carry-out, `c_out`. The addition is carried out bit by bit using four instances of another module named `FullAdder_s`, with each instance handling one bit of the sum and generating the respective carry bits (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c_out`) that are passed sequentially through the instances to compute the final results."

The input port `c_in` is a carry-in bit which is added to the least significant bit of the sum, allowing for cascaded additions with other adder modules.\n\nOutput ports: `[3:0] sum_out, c_out`.\nExplanation: The output port `sum_out` is a 4-bit vector representing the sum of the two input numbers `n1` and `n2`, taking into account the carry-in bit. The output port `c_out` is a carry-out bit which indicates an overflow from the most significant bit of the sum, useful for cascaded addition operations where multiple `fullAdder4Bit_s` modules might be linked together."

Specifically, `c1` carries the overflow from the addition of the least significant bits (handled by `FullAdder_s FA0`) to the second least significant bit addition (handled by `FullAdder_s FA1`). Similarly, `c2` carries the overflow from `FA1` to `FA2`, and `c3` carries the overflow from `FA2` to the most significant bit addition (handled by `FullAdder_s FA3`).
