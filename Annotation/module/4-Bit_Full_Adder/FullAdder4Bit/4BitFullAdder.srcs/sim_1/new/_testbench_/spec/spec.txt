Module name: testbench. 
Module specification: The 'testbench' module is designed to simulate and validate the operations of a 4-bit full adder included within the module as an instance named 'FA4' of type 'fullAdder4Bit_s'. It tests the adder's capacity to handle binary additions of different projects. This module includes input ports [N1, N2, C_IN], where 'N1' and 'N2' are 4-bit registers representing two binary numbers being added, and 'C_IN' is a 1-bit register representing a carry-in value. The outputs of the module are [SUM, C_OUT], where 'SUM' is a 4-bit wire conveying the binary sum of 'N1', 'N2', and 'C_IN', and 'C_OUT' is a 1-bit wire indicating the carry-out from the most significant bit addition. These internal signals also act as output ports, illustrating the dual role in the Verilog module structure. The code consists of two main initial blocks: one for the monitoring process and another for assigning and changing input values over time, facilitating dynamic simulation tests. It meticulously tracks and displays the time, input line states, and results of the addition through the $monitor function to verify correct behavior of the full adder under various conditions.
