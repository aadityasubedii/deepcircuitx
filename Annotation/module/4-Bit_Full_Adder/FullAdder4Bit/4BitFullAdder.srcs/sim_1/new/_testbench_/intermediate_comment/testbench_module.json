    "module": "The 'testbench' module simulates and tests a 4-bit full adder by applying various binary inputs to assess its arithmetic capabilities. Using input registers N1, N2, and C_IN for carrying two numbers and a carry-in value, and output wires SUM and C_OUT for the resulting sum and carry-out, it utilizes a fullAdder4Bit_s instance for the logic operations. Two initial blocks manage input variations and monitor results, printing state changes and computed outputs at specific time steps to validate adder functionality."
