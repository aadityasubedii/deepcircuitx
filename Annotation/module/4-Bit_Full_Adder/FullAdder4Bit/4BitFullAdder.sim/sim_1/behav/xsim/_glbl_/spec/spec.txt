Module name: glbl. 

Module specification: The 'glbl' module serves as a global settings controller in Verilog projects, particularly used for simulation and configuration of global signals in FPGA designs, without any input ports and several output ports namely GSR, GTS, PRLD, GRESTORE, PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL, JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, and JTAG_TRST_GLBL. These outputs handle various global conditions such as set/reset signals, tri-state controls, configuration reloads and others, along with JTAG interface signals that deal with different test operational modes. Internal signals like GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int, GRESTORE_int manage the internal state corresponding to each output respectively, alongside additional internal JTAG signals such as JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL which control specific JTAG operations. The code consists of initial blocks that set the state of GSR_int, GTS_int, and GRESTORE_int after certain delays, managed by parameters like ROC_WIDTH, TOC_WIDTH and GRES_WIDTH, which illustrate the timing for these signals to take effect in the simulation or configuration process. Overall, the module ensures the initialization and management of global signals that are crucial for the correct simulation and operation of FPGA-based designs.
