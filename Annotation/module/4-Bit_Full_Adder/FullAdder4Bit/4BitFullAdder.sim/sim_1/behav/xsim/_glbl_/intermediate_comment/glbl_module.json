    "module": "The 'glbl' module configures global settings for FPGA simulations, handling initialization and management of global signals such as set/reset, tri-state, reload, and JTAG functionalities. It uses internal registers (GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int, GRESTORE_int) controlled via initial blocks with parameters defining specific delay timings, effectively setting up the necessary environment across multiple design components without external inputs, thus streamlining the simulation and configuration process for complex digital designs."
