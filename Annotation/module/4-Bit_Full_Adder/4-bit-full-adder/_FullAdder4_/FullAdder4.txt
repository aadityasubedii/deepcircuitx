The FullAdder4 module performs 4-bit binary addition on two inputs A and B along with a carry-in Ci, yielding a 4-bit sum S and a carry-out Co. It achieves this by chaining four instances of a 1-bit full adder (FullAdder1), each processing successive bits from least to most significant and propagating intermediates carries to ensure correct sum and carry calculations across all bit positions.
