Module name: FullAdder4. Module specification: The FullAdder4 module performs 4-bit binary addition of two inputs A and B along with a carry input Ci, and outputs a 4-bit sum S and a carry output Co. It employs four instances of a submodule named FullAdder1, which calculates a 1-bit sum and a 1-bit carry. The input ports include Ci (initial carry-in), A[3:0] and B[3:0] (two 4-bit inputs for the addition). The output ports are Co (carry output from the addition of the most significant bits) and S[3:0] (4-bit output sum). Internally, the module uses signals S_ALTERA_SYNTHESIZED[3:0] to store intermediate 1-bit sums from each FullAdder1 instance. Additional internal wires SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_0, SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_1, and SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_2 are used to carry intermediate carry outputs between the instances of FullAdder1. The code is organized into instantiations of FullAdder1 for each bit of A and B starting from the least significant bit, with carries being propagated through the SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_x signals to adjacent higher bit positions, culminating in the carry out Co from the most significant bit calculation. The sum results from all stages are consolidated in the S_ALTERA_SYNTHESIZED array and then assigned to the output S. This systematic cascade of full adders efficiently computes the 4-bit sum and carry out based on the provided inputs.
