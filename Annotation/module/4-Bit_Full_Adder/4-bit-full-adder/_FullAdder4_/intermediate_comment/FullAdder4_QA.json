It takes two 4-bit inputs, A and B, along with a carry input (Ci), and produces a 4-bit sum output (S) and a carry output (Co). The module works by connecting four instances of another module (presumably a 1-bit full adder named `FullAdder1`) in a series, starting from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. Each instance calculates the sum and carry for one bit of A and B considering the carry from the lower bit. The results are then combined to form the overall 4-bit sum output, and the final carry out after the most significant bit operation is provided as the output Co."

It represents the initial carry-in value, typically used in extended arithmetic operations where multiple full adders are cascaded.\n- `A[3:0]`: This is a 4-bit input, representing one of the two numbers (or sets of signals) to be added.\n- `B[3:0]`: This is the other 4-bit input, representing the second number (or set of signals) to be added. Together with `A`, this port acts as the primary data inputs for the addition operation.\n\nOutput ports: `Co`, `S[3:0]`.\nExplanation:\n- `Co`: This is the carry output of the 4-bit full adder. It outputs the carry resulting from the addition of the most significant bits. This could be used as an input carry to another full adder in a cascaded configuration.\n- `S[3:0]`: This is the 4-bit output of the module, representing the sum of inputs `A` and `B` with respect to the input carry `Ci`. Each bit in this output corresponds to the sum computed at each bit position of the inputs."
