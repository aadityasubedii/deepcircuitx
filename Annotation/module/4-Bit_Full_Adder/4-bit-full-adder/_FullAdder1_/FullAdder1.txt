The FullAdder1 module performs 1-bit addition of two binary digits A, B along with carry-in Ci, outputting the sum S and carry-out Co. It utilizes internal wires and logical operations (AND, XOR, OR) assigned to manage and compute the intermediary values, ultimately determining S by XORing the inputs and combining conditions for Co through ORed AND results, ensuring efficient bit-wise addition handling.
