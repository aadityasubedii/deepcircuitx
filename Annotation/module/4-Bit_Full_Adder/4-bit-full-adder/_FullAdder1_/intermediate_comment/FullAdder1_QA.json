This device takes two one-bit binary numbers (A and B) and a carry-in (Ci) as inputs and produces a sum (S) and a carry-out (Co). The sum outputs the result of A XOR B XOR Ci, while the carry-out calculates the carry generated by adding A, B, and Ci, which is used in multi-bit addition to carry into the next higher bit. The carry-out (Co) is derived using OR operations on the three possible carry generating conditions: A AND B, B AND Ci, and A AND Ci."
