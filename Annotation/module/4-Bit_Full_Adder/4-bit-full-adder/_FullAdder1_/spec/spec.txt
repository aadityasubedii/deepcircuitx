Module name: FullAdder1. Module specification: The FullAdder1 module in Verilog is designed to implement a 1-bit full adder, which performs the addition of two binary digits (A and B) along with a carry-in (Ci) from the previous bit's addition, producing a sum (S) and a carry-out (Co). It accepts three input wires: 'A' and 'B' are the one-bit binary inputs, and 'Ci' is the carry-in bit, indicating a potential overflow from adding less significant bits. The module outputs two wires: 'S', which is the sum bit resulting from A XOR B XOR Ci, and 'Co', the carry-out bit that combines by OR operation on three AND conditions (A and B, B and Ci, A and Ci) indicating an overflow to the next most significant bit. Internally, the module utilizes four synthesized wires to break down and manage the computations: SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_0 computes A XOR B preliminarily, SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_1 to SYNTHESIZED_WIRE_3 evaluate the three carry-generating conditions using AND operations accordingly. These components are vital in structuring the final outputs through specified assignments in the code that simplify the logical determination of 'S' and 'Co'. The Verilog implementation effectively separates the logic into distinct assignments for clarity and modular construction of the final calculations.
