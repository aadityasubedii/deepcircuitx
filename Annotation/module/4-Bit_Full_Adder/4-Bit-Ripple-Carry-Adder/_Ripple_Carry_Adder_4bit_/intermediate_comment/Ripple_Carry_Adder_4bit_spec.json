Module specification: The Ripple_Carry_Adder_4bit is a Verilog module that implements a 4-bit adder using the ripple carry method, which involves chaining full adder blocks to compute the sum and the carry-out from the input bits. The module takes in two 4-bit numbers, `a[3:0]` and `b[3:0]`, along with an initial carry input bit `c`. The output comprises a 4-bit sum `sum[3:0]` that represents the resultant addition of `a` and `b` taking into account the carry bits, and a carry-out `cout` that results from the addition of the most significant bits. Internal signals `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` serve as interim carry bits between the series of full adders, where each `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` is the output of one full adder and the input carry to the next, thus supporting the ripple effect needed for the carry bits across the 4-bit span. The module comprises sub-modules: four instances of the `FA` (Full Adder) block named `d0`, `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`, each responsible for adding individual bits from `a` and `b` together with a carry-in, and producing a sum and carry-out bit. The full adders are connected sequentially with `d0` processing the least significant bits and `d3` the most, passing carry bits from one to the next to achieve the addition across all four bits.",
