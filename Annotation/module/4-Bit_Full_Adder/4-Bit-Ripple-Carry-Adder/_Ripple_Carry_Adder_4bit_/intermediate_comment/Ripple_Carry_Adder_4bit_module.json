    "module": "The Ripple_Carry_Adder_4bit module implements a 4-bit addition using the ripple carry technique by chaining four instances of the Full Adder (FA) module. Each FA instance adds corresponding bits of two input numbers `a[3:0]` and `b[3:0]`, along with a propagated carry bit, outputting a resultant sum bit and a carry-out bit which is fed into the next adder, culminating in a 4-bit sum and an overall carry-out."
