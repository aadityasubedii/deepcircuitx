It is equipped with input ports a0, a1, a2, a3, b0, b1, b2, b3, and cin which represent two four-bit binary numbers and a carry-in bit, respectively. These inputs are fed into the designated device under test (DUT), a ripple_carry_adder module. The output ports from the DUT include s0, s1, s2, s3, representing the four bits of the resultant sum, and cout, which indicates the carry-out bit of the operation. These outputs are crucial in verifying the correct addition of the input numbers along with proper carry propagation. Internally, the testbench utilizes the monitor statement within an initial block to display the values of the inputs and outputs at designated simulation times, effectively simulating all possible 4-bit addition scenarios including edge cases with the carry-in. This approach allows for comprehensive testing and debugging, assuring the accurate performance of the ripple carry adder in various operational circumstances.",
