    "module": "The ripple_carry_adder_tb module is designed to test the functionality of a ripple carry adder, simulating the addition of 4-bit binary numbers with consideration of carry-in and carry-out. It utilizes a set of register inputs to represent two 4-bit numbers and a carry bit, which are fed into the ripple_carry_adder (dut). Output bits from the addition process are captured through wire connections and monitored to verify correct behavior. It systematically applies various input combinations and uses a monitor statement in an initial block to demonstrate all possible addition outcomes, ensuring comprehensive testing and validation of the adder circuit."
