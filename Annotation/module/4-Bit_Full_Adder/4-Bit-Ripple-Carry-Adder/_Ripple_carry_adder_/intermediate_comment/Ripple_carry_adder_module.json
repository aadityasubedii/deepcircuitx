    "module": "The ripple_carry_adder module performs a 4-bit binary addition of two numbers using a ripple carry method. It employs four instances of a full_adder submodule, each handling one bit of the input numbers and a cascading carry between them, from the least significant to the most significant bit, where outputs include the sum bits (s0-s3) and an overflow carry (cout). This structure demonstrates modular design and sequential processing in hardware implementation."
