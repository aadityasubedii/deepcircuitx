Module name: ripple_carry_adder. Module specification: The ripple_carry_adder is a Verilog module designed to perform a 4-bit binary addition of two numbers, utilizing a ripple carry mechanism. The module leverages four instances of a full_adder submodule to process each bit of the input numbers (a0-a3 for the first number and b0-b3 for the second number), with an initial carry input (cin). The inputs include a0, a1, a2, a3, b0, b1, b2, b3, and cin, where 'a' and 'b' represent the bits of the two binary numbers to be added, and 'cin' is the initial carry. The outputs consist of s0, s1, s2, s3 representing the result bits of the addition, and cout, which is the carry out from the last addition indicating if there is an overflow. Internal signals such as c0, c1, and c2 serve as the carries between consecutive full adder stages, facilitating the ripple effect from least significant to most significant bit. In terms of structure, the code defines inputs, outputs, and interconnections within the full adder instances that logically chain together to produce the final sum and carry out. Each full adder instance (fa1 to fa4) corresponds to a bit-pair addition of a and b along with the carry propagated from the previous stage, demonstrating modular design and the implementation of a basic arithmetic operation.
