The tb_demux_1x2 module acts as a testbench for a 1-to-2 demultiplexer, simulating and checking its functionality by toggling the input 'y' and select line 'sel', and observing the changes on outputs 'd0' and 'd1'. It initializes 'y' and 'sel' through a series of staged conditions, applying timing delays to transition through different input states, while a monitor function continuously tracks and displays the time and state of all signals for verification purposes.
