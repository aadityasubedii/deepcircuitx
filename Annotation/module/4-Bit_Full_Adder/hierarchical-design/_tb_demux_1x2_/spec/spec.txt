Module name: tb_demux_1x2. 

Module specification: The tb_demux_1x2 module serves as a testbench for verifying the functionality of a 1-to-2 demultiplexer (demux). It primarily functions by simulating the behavior of the demux through the controlled manipulation of the input signals and monitoring the responsive changes in the output signals. The module employs two input ports: 'y' and 'sel'. 'y' acts as the data input, determining the binary value to be routed to the outputs, while 'sel' functions as the select line, deciding which output ('d0' or 'd1') will actively carry the data signal from 'y'. The output ports, 'd0' and 'd1', carry the data based on the state of the 'sel': d0 is actuated when sel is 0, and d1 is actuated when sel is 1, otherwise, they remain at 0. Internally, the module uses 'y' and 'sel' as register types to feed the demux unit and 'd0' and 'd1' as wire types to carry the separated outputs. The module includes two initial blocks: the first block iterates through various combinations of 'y' and 'sel', effectuating toggles, providing a delay of 10ns between transitions, and finally calling $finish to end the simulation; the second block contains a $monitor function designed to display the time and the states of all signals ('y', 'sel', 'd0', 'd1') during the simulation, thereby facilitating the observation and debugging of the test outputs. This structure ensures comprehensive verification through detailed output monitoring under controlled input conditions.
