Module name: tb_full_adder. Module specification: The `tb_full_adder` module serves as a testbench for verifying the functionality of a full adder circuit. It simulates a full adder by accepting three binary inputs (`a_in`, `b_in`, and `c_in`), where `a_in` and `b_in` are the main inputs and `c_in` is the carry input from any previous stage. The outputs are `sum` and `carry`, which respectively indicate the result of the addition and any overflow that acts as the carry for a subsequent stage. Internally, the `sum` and `carry` are wires connected to an instance of the full adder module, designated as `haa1`. The testbench systematically modifies the input values through a sequential block, beginning with all inputs set to zero, and then individually sets each high in timed intervals to test all input combinations. This simulation setup ensures all possible input states are tested for correct functionality. The outputs and the progression of the test scenarios are monitored and displayed in real-time using `$monitor` for observing the behavior and validating the correctness of the full adder's logic under different input conditions before the simulation terminates with `$finish`.
