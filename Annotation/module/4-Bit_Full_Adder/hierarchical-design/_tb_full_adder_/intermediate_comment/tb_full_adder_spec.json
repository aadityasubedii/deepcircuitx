Internally, the `sum` and `carry` are wires connected to an instance of the full adder module, designated as `haa1`. The testbench systematically modifies the input values through a sequential block, beginning with all inputs set to zero, and then individually sets each high in timed intervals to test all input combinations. This simulation setup ensures all possible input states are tested for correct functionality. The outputs and the progression of the test scenarios are monitored and displayed in real-time using `$monitor` for observing the behavior and validating the correctness of the full adder's logic under different input conditions before the simulation terminates with `$finish`.",

The `carry` signal indicates whether there is an overflow out of the most significant bit (essentially, if the sum of the input bits is greater than what can be represented as a single bit).
