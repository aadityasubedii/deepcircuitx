The `tb_full_adder` module serves as a testbench for a full adder circuit, simulating and verifying its functionality by using sequential logic to apply various test vectors to the inputs (`a_in`, `b_in`, `c_in`) and monitoring the outputs (`sum`, `carry`). It achieves this by systematically changing the input signals over timed intervals, observing the adder's behavioral responses through the `$monitor` function, ensuring all possible combinations are tested for correctness before concluding the simulation with `$finish`.
