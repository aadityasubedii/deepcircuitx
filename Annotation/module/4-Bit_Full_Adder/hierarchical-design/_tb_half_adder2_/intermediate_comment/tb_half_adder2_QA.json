The testbench initializes and manipulates input signals `s` and `c_in` and observes outputs `sum` and `c_out` by stepping through various combinations of inputs over time using timing delays (`#10`). It uses `$monitor` to display signal values each time they change, helping in verification of the half-adder logic under different input scenarios."

It reflects the sum of the input bits `s` and `c_in` as per the half-adder logic.\n- `c_out` (carry output): This is the carry output of the half-adder. It represents the carry generated when the sum of `s` and `c_in` exceeds the capacity of a single bit, i.e., when both inputs are 1, indicating that a carry should be passed to the next higher order of bit addition in multi-bit scenarios."
