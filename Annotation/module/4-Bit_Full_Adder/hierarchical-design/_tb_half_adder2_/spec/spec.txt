Module name: tb_half_adder2. 
Module specification: The `tb_half_adder2` is a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of a half-adder circuit, specifically modeled in the `half_adder2` submodule. It inputs two signals, `s` and `c_in`, which are respectively a primary binary input and a carry input from a possible previous addition. The outputs under test are `sum` and `c_out`, representing the outcome of the binary addition and the resultant carry. Internally, `s` and `c_in` are registered signals that the testbench manipulates to simulate various conditions, while `sum` and `c_out` are wired to the outputs from the `half_adder2` instance. The testbench initializes `s` and `c_in` to zero, then sequentially modifies them, introducing delays (`#10`) between changes to simulate time progression. An initial block with `$monitor` is used to print out the values of all signals every time they change to observe and verify the correct operation of the half-adder logic under different scenarios. This helps in tracking the dynamics of signal changes and ensuring the half-adder's functionality is as expected over simulated time.
