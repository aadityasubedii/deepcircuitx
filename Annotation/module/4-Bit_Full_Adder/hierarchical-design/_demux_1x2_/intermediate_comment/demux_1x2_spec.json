The inputs include 'y', which is the data signal that needs to be routed, and 'sel', a select signal that directs 'y' to 'd1' if 'sel' is high (1), and to 'd0' when low (0). The outputs are 'd0' and 'd1', where 'd0' receives 'y' when 'sel' is 0, and 'd1' receives 'y' when 'sel' is 1. There are no internal signals used as the demultiplexing is achieved directly through the use of the conditional assignment expression `{d0,d1} = sel?{1'b0,y}: {y,1'b0};`. This expression utilizes the ternary operator to conditionally assign 'y' to 'd0' or 'd1' and setting the other to 0 based on the value of 'sel'. The module comprises of this single line of functional code, efficiently implementing the demultiplexing mechanism without additional internal complexity.",
