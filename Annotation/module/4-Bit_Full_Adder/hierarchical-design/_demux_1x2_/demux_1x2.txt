The demux_1x2 module functions as a 1-to-2 demultiplexer, routing the input signal 'y' to either of the two outputs 'd0' or 'd1' based on the state of the select signal 'sel'. It implements this functionality using a conditional assignment with the ternary operator, `{d0,d1} = sel?{1'b0,y}: {y,1'b0};`, efficiently directing 'y' to the appropriate output while setting the other to 0, without the need for additional internal signals.
