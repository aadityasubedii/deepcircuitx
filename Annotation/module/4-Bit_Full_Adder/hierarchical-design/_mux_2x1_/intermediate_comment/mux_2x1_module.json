    "module": "The mux_2x1 module implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer, selecting between two input signals based on a select signal. It utilizes a NOT gate to invert the select signal, two AND gates to conditionally pass each input signal based on the select state, and an OR gate to combine these signals at the output, effectively outputting either 'in_0' or 'in_1' as 'mux_out' depending on the state of 'sel'."
