    "spec": "Module name: mux_2x1. Module specification: The mux_2x1 module executes a basic 2-to-1 multiplexer operation in digital circuits, switching between two input signals based on a select signal. The module has three input ports: 'in_0' and 'in_1', which are the data inputs, and 'sel', which serves as the select line dictating which input is forwarded to the output. The single output port is 'mux_out', expressing the chosen input based on 'sel'. Internally, the module incorporates three signals 'w1', 'w2', and 'w3'. 'w1' holds the inverted 'sel' signal, ensuring that 'in_0' is selected when 'sel' is low. 'w2' and 'w3' are outputs from AND gates, carrying forward 'in_0' or 'in_1' conditioned on 'sel's value. These intermediate signals contribute to the operation of an OR gate that consolidates the outputs from 'w2' and 'w3' to produce 'mux_out'. The module's code structure includes instantiation of NOT, AND, and OR gates directly facilitating this selection and output logic in an efficient and understandable manner.",

It takes two input signals (in_0, in_1) and a select signal (sel). Depending on the value of 'sel', the output 'mux_out' will either be the value of 'in_0' (when 'sel' is 0, as the NOT gate inverts it to 1 for the AND gate with 'in_0') or 'in_1' (when 'sel' is 1, directly going to the AND gate with 'in_1'). This function is achieved using basic logic gates: NOT, AND, and OR, to select between the two input signals based on the selector input."
