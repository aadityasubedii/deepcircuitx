It takes two input signals (in_0, in_1) and a select signal (sel). Depending on the value of 'sel', the output 'mux_out' will either be the value of 'in_0' (when 'sel' is 0, as the NOT gate inverts it to 1 for the AND gate with 'in_0') or 'in_1' (when 'sel' is 1, directly going to the AND gate with 'in_1'). This function is achieved using basic logic gates: NOT, AND, and OR, to select between the two input signals based on the selector input."

'sel' is the select signal that determines which input signal (between 'in_0' and 'in_1') is forwarded to the output. If 'sel' is 0, 'in_0' is selected, and if 'sel' is 1, 'in_1' is selected.\n\nOutput ports: mux_out.\nExplanation: 'mux_out' is the output of the multiplexer. It outputs the value of either 'in_0' or 'in_1' based on the state of the 'sel' input signal. The output is derived by using a combination of NOT, AND, and OR gates to implement the selection logic."

This signal helps in selecting 'in_0' when 'sel' is 0 (because NOT gate inverts it to 1, allowing 'in_0' to pass through the AND gate connected to 'w2').\n- 'w2' is the output of the AND gate that takes 'in_0' and 'w1' as inputs. This ensures that 'in_0' is forwarded to the output ('mux_out') only when 'sel' is 0 (since 'w1' becomes 1 when 'sel' is 0).\n- 'w3' is the output of another AND gate, which takes 'in_1' and 'sel' directly as its inputs. This configuration forwards 'in_1' to the output ('mux_out') when 'sel' is 1.
