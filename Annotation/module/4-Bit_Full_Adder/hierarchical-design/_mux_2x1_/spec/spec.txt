Module name: mux_2x1. Module specification: The mux_2x1 module executes a basic 2-to-1 multiplexer operation in digital circuits, switching between two input signals based on a select signal. The module has three input ports: 'in_0' and 'in_1', which are the data inputs, and 'sel', which serves as the select line dictating which input is forwarded to the output. The single output port is 'mux_out', expressing the chosen input based on 'sel'. Internally, the module incorporates three signals 'w1', 'w2', and 'w3'. 'w1' holds the inverted 'sel' signal, ensuring that 'in_0' is selected when 'sel' is low. 'w2' and 'w3' are outputs from AND gates, carrying forward 'in_0' or 'in_1' conditioned on 'sel's value. These intermediate signals contribute to the operation of an OR gate that consolidates the outputs from 'w2' and 'w3' to produce 'mux_out'. The module's code structure includes instantiation of NOT, AND, and OR gates directly facilitating this selection and output logic in an efficient and understandable manner.
