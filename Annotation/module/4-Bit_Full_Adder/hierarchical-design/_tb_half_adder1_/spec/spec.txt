Module name: tb_half_adder1. Module specification: The 'tb_half_adder1' module is a testbench designed for verifying the functionality of a half adder circuit, encapsulated within another module called 'half_adder1'. Its purpose is to simulate user-defined inputs ('a_in', 'b_in') and verify the resulting sum ('s') and carry ('c') outputs computed by the half adder. The testbench employs two input ports: 'a_in' and 'b_in', representing binary inputs used to test the half-adder logic, and two internal signals: 's' and 'c', which capture the sum and carry output from the half adder. The code is structured into initialization blocks where input signals 'a_in' and 'b_in' are driven sequentially with specific timing to produce and observe changes in the output signals. Additionally, a monitoring block is setup to display the time, input, and output states, thereby enabling the validation of the half adderâ€™s operation under various test conditions.
