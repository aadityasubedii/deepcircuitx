The `half_adder1` module performs binary addition of two single-bit inputs, outputting the sum and carry. It implements this by directly connecting input ports `a_in` and `b_in` to an XOR gate for the sum (`s`) and an AND gate for the carry (`c`), thus simplifying the design without intermediate signals.
