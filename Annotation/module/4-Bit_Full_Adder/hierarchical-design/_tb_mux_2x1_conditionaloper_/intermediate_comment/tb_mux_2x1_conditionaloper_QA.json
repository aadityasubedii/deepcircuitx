It simulates different scenarios by applying various combinations of inputs (`in_0`, `in_1`) and a select signal (`sel`) to determine the output (`mux_outt`) of the multiplexer. The testbench uses specific timing delays to sequence the inputs and captures the output state at each point using a monitor statement, effectively checking the multiplexer's behavior during these transitions."

The `sel` or select input determines which of `in_0` or `in_1` gets passed to the output. In this setup, if `sel` is 0, `in_0` is chosen, and if `sel` is 1, `in_1` is chosen.\n\nOutput ports: `mux_outt`.\nExplanation: `mux_outt` is the output of the multiplexer. It reflects the value of either `in_0` or `in_1` based on the state of the `sel` signal. This output port is used to verify the correct operation of the multiplexer in the testbench by observing whether it correctly passes the selected input signal."

In the testbench module, it serves as a data signal whose value can be manipulated to simulate different input conditions.\n- `in_1`: This is the second input to the multiplexer. Similar to `in_0`, it allows the testbench to provide an alternative data signal to the multiplexer for verifying its output behavior under various scenarios.\n- `sel`: The selection signal for the multiplexer. This signal determines which of the two inputs (`in_0` or `in_1`) is routed to the output. Changing its value within the testbench tests the multiplexer's ability to switch between inputs correctly.\n- `mux_outt`: The output of the multiplexer, which is the result of the selection made based on the `sel` signal's state. In the testbench, monitoring this signal helps verify that the multiplexer operates as expected, routing the correct input to the output based on `sel`."
