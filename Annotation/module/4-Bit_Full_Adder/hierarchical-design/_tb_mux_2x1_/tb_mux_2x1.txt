The 'tb_mux_2x1' module functions as a testbench for a 2x1 multiplexer, generating test inputs to confirm the mux's response under different conditions. It employs registers 'in_0', 'in_1', and 'sel' for inputs, and a wire 'mux_out' for output monitoring. Test inputs are varied in a timed sequence within the 'initial' block to simulate different scenarios and an additional 'initial' block uses '$monitor' to display signal values, facilitating real-time tracking of the mux behavior.
