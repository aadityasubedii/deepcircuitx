Module name: tb_mux_2x1. Module specification: The 'tb_mux_2x1' module serves as a testbench for testing a 2x1 multiplexer, verifying its functionality by dynamically assigning inputs and observing outputs. It interfaces with three input ports: 'in_0' and 'in_1', acting as data inputs, and 'sel' acting as the selector that determines which input data is passed to the output. The single output port is 'mux_out', which reflects the selected input. Inside the module, these ports are linked to internal signals by the same names, which connect to an instance of the 'mux_2x1' module instantiated in the testbench. The code contains multiple 'initial' blocks: one that carefully sequences changes to 'in_0' and 'in_1' to simulate real-world input scenarios and the complementary 'monitor' block designed to display the signal states and output at various simulation times. These blocks are essential for initiating the testbench behavior, observing its dynamic outputs, and ensuring that the module operates as expected under varied conditions.
