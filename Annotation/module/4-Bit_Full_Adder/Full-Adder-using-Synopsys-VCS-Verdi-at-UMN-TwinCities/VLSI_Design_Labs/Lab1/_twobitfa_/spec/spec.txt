Module name: twobitfa. Module specification: The 'twobitfa' module is a Verilog implementation of a two-bit full adder, designed to add two 2-bit binary numbers and a carry-in bit to produce a 2-bit sum and a carry-out bit. This module takes three inputs: 'a' and 'b' which are the 2-bit binary numbers, and 'c_in', a single-bit input that represents the carry-in to the least significant bit. The outputs of the module are 'sum', a 2-bit value representing the resulting sum, and 'c_out', a single-bit output representing the carry-out from the most significant bit, suitable for cascading into higher bit adders. Internally, the module utilizes a wire 'c1' which acts as an intermediary to pass the carry generated by the least significant bit (handled by the first instance of the 'fulladd' module, fa0) to the most significant bit (handled by the second instance of the 'fulladd' module, fa1). The code is also accompanied by a test module named 'stimulus' that sets up test conditions and monitors the output of the 'twobitfa' module, ensuring it operates correctly under specified input scenarios. The stimulus simulates the inputs 'A', 'B', and 'C_IN' through a sequence of assignments and utilizes delays to observe changes in outputs 'SUM' and 'C_OUT' over time.
