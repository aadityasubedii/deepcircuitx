    "module": "The 'stimulus' module tests a full adder's logic by simulating different input scenarios on its inputs A, B, and C_IN, checking the output SUM and carry-out C_OUT. Internally, it uses initial blocks to monitor output in real time and to set and update test inputs sequentially with precise timing, thereby verifying the circuit's response to various combinations of binary inputs."
