Module name: stimulus. 
Module specification: The 'stimulus' module is designed to test the functionality of a full adder circuit by simulating various input scenarios. It primarily functions through its input ports: A, B, and C_IN, which are single-bit binary inputs representing the two operands and a carry-in from a prior addition stage, respectively. The module outputs through two ports: SUM and C_OUT, where SUM is the result of the addition, and C_OUT is the carry-out bit used for subsequent additions in multi-bit operations. Internally, the module uses wire signals for SUM and C_OUT to carry the results from the full adder instantiation. The module includes multiple initial blocks: one for monitoring the output in real-time using the $monitor function, reflecting changes at every time unit when signals are altered, and another block setups different test cases for inputs A, B, and C_IN sequentially with specific timing delays to verify all possible combinations of inputs and effectively test the full adder's logic in handling both sum and carry operations.
