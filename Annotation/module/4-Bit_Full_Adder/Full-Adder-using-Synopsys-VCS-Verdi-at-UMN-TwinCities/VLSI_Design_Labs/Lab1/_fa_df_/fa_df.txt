The 'fulladd' module implements a full adder using dataflow Verilog. It calculates the sum and carry-out of three input bits (a, b, c_in) where 'sum' uses bitwise XOR across inputs, and 'c_out' considers any two-bit combinations using AND-OR logic, directly assigning results to outputs, streamlined by not using internal signals. An initial block is used for debug messages to indicate operational status during simulations.
