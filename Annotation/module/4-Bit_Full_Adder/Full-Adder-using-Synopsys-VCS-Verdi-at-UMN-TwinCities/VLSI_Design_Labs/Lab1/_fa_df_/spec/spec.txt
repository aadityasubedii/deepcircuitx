Module name: fulladd. Module specification: The 'fulladd' module is a full adder designed in Verilog using a dataflow modeling style, purposed to perform binary addition of three single-bit inputsâ€”'a', 'b', and 'c_in'. 'a' and 'b' represent the binary numbers to be added, while 'c_in' is the carry input from a previous addition, enabling multi-bit addition across several instances of this module. The output of the module includes 'sum' and 'c_out'. 'sum' is derived from the XOR operation across all three inputs, indicating the basic result of the addition without the carry, whereas 'c_out' is calculated using a combination of AND and OR operations across the inputs to determine if there's a carry to be forwarded. Internally, the module utilizes direct assignments without temporary or intermediate wires or registers, making the design efficient and straightforward. The module features an initial block where a debug message is displayed indicating the use of the dataflow model, aiding in simulation and testing phases. This highlights the active configuration and aids in the debugging process, ensuring clarity during development and verification.
