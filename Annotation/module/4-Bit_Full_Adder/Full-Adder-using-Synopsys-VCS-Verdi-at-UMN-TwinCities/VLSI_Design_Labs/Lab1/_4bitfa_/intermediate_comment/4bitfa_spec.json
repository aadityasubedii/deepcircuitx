    "spec": "Module name: RCA and full_adder. Module specification: The RCA (Ripple Carry Adder) and full_adder modules are designed to perform binary addition operations in Verilog. The full_adder module performs a single-bit addition, taking three inputs: 'a' and 'b' (the bits to be added) and 'cin' (carry-in from a previous addition). It outputs 's' (the sum of the inputs) and 'cout' (carry-out to the next stage of addition). The RCA module performs a 4-bit addition using the full_adder module. It takes two 4-bit inputs 'p' and 'q' for addition, along with an initial carry input 'c0'. The RCA module outputs a 5-bit result 'r', with r[0] to r[3] being the sum bits and r[4] the final carry-out. Internally, RCA uses three wires: 'c1', 'c2', and 'c3' to cascade the carry-out from one full_adder instance to the carry-in of the next, effectively chaining four full_adder modules. Each full_adder instance calculates one corresponding bit of the output result, with the carry propagating through 'c1' to 'c3', and finally to 'r[4]'. The structured linking of these full_adder modules enables the RCA to operate as a 4-bit adder with contiguous carry propagation, representing a fundamental construct in multi-bit arithmetic operations.",

The full_adder module takes three inputs (a, b, cin) which represent two bits to be added and a carry-in bit. It outputs two bits, s (sum) and cout (carry out). The sum bit 's' is computed as the XOR of all three input bits, and the carry out 'cout' is computed using an OR of all combinations of AND operations among the inputs. The RCA module, which stands for Ripple Carry Adder, uses instances of the full_adder module to add two 4-bit numbers, p and q, along with an initial carry input c0. It produces a 5-bit result r, where the last bit is the final carry out. The RCA module constructs a 4-bit adder by cascading four full_adder instances, each computing one bit of the final result and passing the carry to the next stage."

Each signal represents the carry out from one stage of the addition, which is used as the carry in for the next stage:\n- **c1** is the carry out from the addition of the least significant bits (p[0] and q[0]) and the initial carry c0. It is used as the carry in for the addition of the next bit pair (p[1] and q[1]).\n- **c2** is the carry out from the addition of the second least significant bits (p[1] and q[1]), with c1 as its carry in. This carry is then used as the carry in for the third bit pair addition (p[2] and q[2]).\n- **c3** is the carry out from the addition of the third bit pair (p[2] and q[2]), using c2 as the carry in. It serves as the carry in for the final bit pair addition (p[3] and q[3]), and the output of this stage's carry out becomes r[4], the final carry out of the RCA module.\n\nThese internal signals are critical for the ripple carry adder\u2019s function, where the carry out of one full adder is chained as the carry in to the next, ultimately allowing multiple single-bit additions linked together to form multi-bit addition."
