    "module": "The full_adder module computes the sum and carry out of two single bits and a carry-in, using XOR and AND-OR gates respectively. The RCA module, using four instances of full_adder, performs a 4-bit addition operation, cascading the carry from one full_adder to the next, outputting the final sum and carry out in a 5-bit vector."
