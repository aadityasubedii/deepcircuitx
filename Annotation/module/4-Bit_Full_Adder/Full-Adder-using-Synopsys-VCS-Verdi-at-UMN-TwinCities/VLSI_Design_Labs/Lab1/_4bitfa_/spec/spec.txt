Module name: RCA and full_adder. Module specification: The RCA (Ripple Carry Adder) and full_adder modules are designed to perform binary addition operations in Verilog. The full_adder module performs a single-bit addition, taking three inputs: 'a' and 'b' (the bits to be added) and 'cin' (carry-in from a previous addition). It outputs 's' (the sum of the inputs) and 'cout' (carry-out to the next stage of addition). The RCA module performs a 4-bit addition using the full_adder module. It takes two 4-bit inputs 'p' and 'q' for addition, along with an initial carry input 'c0'. The RCA module outputs a 5-bit result 'r', with r[0] to r[3] being the sum bits and r[4] the final carry-out. Internally, RCA uses three wires: 'c1', 'c2', and 'c3' to cascade the carry-out from one full_adder instance to the carry-in of the next, effectively chaining four full_adder modules. Each full_adder instance calculates one corresponding bit of the output result, with the carry propagating through 'c1' to 'c3', and finally to 'r[4]'. The structured linking of these full_adder modules enables the RCA to operate as a 4-bit adder with contiguous carry propagation, representing a fundamental construct in multi-bit arithmetic operations.
