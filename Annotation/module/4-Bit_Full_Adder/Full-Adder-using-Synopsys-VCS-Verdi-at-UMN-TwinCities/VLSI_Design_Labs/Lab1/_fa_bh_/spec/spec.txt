Module name: fulladd. Module specification: The "fulladd" module is specifically designed to compute the full addition of three binary inputs: a, b, and c_in (carry-in). It outputs the sum ('sum') and the carry out ('c_out'). The inputs 'a' and 'b' are the primary binary values added together, while 'c_in' serves as the carry input from a prior stage in multiple-bit additions. The output 'sum' indicates the least significant bit of the addition, and 'c_out' is the carry out bit, potentially used in subsequent additions in multi-bit arithmetic operations. Internal signals include 'sum' and 'c_out', both implemented as registers, holding the binary addition results. The module encompasses an always block triggered by changes in 'a', 'b', or 'c_in', using non-blocking assignments to update the results synchronously. Moreover, an initial block displays a message, "Using bh model," indicating the use of a behavioral model during simulations. This message can aid in debugging or understanding the simulation context.
