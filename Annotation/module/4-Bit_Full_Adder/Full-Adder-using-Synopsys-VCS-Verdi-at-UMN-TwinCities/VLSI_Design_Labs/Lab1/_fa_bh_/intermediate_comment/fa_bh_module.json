    "module": "The \"fulladd\" module performs a full binary addition of three inputs (a, b, and c_in), producing outputs 'sum' and 'c_out'. It computes the addition using non-blocking assignments within an always block triggered by any changes in the inputs, ensuring synchronous updates of the sum and carry outputs. An initial block provides a behavioral simulation cue by displaying \"Using bh model\"."
