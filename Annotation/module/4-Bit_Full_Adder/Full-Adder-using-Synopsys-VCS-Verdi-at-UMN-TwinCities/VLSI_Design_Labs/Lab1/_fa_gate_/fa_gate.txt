The "fulladd" module implements a full adder using basic logic gates, designed to handle three inputs ('a', 'b', and 'c_in') and outputs the sum and carry-out ('sum', 'c_out'). It utilizes XOR gates for sum calculation, AND gates for intermediate carry detection, and an OR gate for final carry output, efficiently allowing multi-bit additions by chaining multiple such adders.
