It takes three input bits: 'a,' 'b,' and 'c_in' (carry input), and outputs two bits: 'sum' and 'c_out' (carry output). The full adder performs the addition of the three input bits and outputs the resultant sum bit and carry bit. The module utilizes XOR gates for sum calculation, AND gates for intermediate carry calculations, and an OR gate to determine the final carry output. The initial block in the module prints a message signaling that a gate model is being used for the functionality of the full adder, emphasizing the use of basic logic gates in the implementation."

The input bit 'c_in' is particularly significant as it allows for cascading multiple full adder modules to handle multi-bit addition operations by carrying forward an additional carry bit generated in the less significant bit stage.\n\nOutput ports: sum, c_out.\nExplanation: The 'sum' output is the result of the bitwise addition of inputs 'a,' 'b,' and 'c_in.' The 'c_out' (carry output) is crucial for multi-bit addition operations necessary in arithmetic logic units or more complex digital systems; it carries out the carry bit signifying an overflow from the addition of the bits, which can be input to the next higher significant stage of an adder."
