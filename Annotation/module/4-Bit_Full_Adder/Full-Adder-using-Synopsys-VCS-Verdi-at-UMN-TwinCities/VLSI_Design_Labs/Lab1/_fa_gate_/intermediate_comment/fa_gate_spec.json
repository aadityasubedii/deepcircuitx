    "spec": "Module name: fulladd. Module specification: The \"fulladd\" module is designed to perform the function of a full adder using basic logic gates. It takes three input bits ('a', 'b', and 'c_in') and provides two outputs ('sum' and 'c_out'). The 'a' and 'b' inputs are the primary operands, and 'c_in' serves as the carry input from a preceding stage, vital for chaining multiple full adders in multi-bit addition operations. The output 'sum' gives the result of the bitwise addition, and 'c_out' delivers the carry-over value useful for subsequent stages. Internally, the module employs several signals: 's1' acts as an intermediate result of 'a' XOR 'b', 'c1' indicates a carry generated by 'a' AND 'b', and 'c2' denotes another potential carry from 's1' AND 'c_in'. The clarity in handling the carry outputs is achieved using an OR gate that processes 'c1' and 'c2' to produce 'c_out'. Additionally, the module begins its execution by displaying a message about using a gate model, which aligns with its implementation of basic gates to simulate the full adder logic. This structured approach ensures a clear understanding and manageability of digital adder operations at a fundamental level.",
