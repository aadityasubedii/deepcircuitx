Module name: four_bit_rca. Module specification: The four_bit_rca module is a Verilog design that implements a four-bit ripple carry adder with both addition and subtraction functionalities, determined by a control signal. It accepts two 4-bit inputs, A and B, and a single-bit control input 'dir'. The outputs include a 4-bit sum (S), a 4-bit carry out (Cout) for each bit of addition, and a single-bit 'overflow' signal indicating arithmetic overflow. Internal signals net0 to net3 are generated by performing an XOR between each bit of B and 'dir', effectively inverting B when subtracting. The module makes use of an external full_adder component for each bit addition/subtraction. The connections include:
- Input A [3:0]: the first 4-bit operand.
- Input B [3:0]: the second 4-bit operand, conditionally inverted based on 'dir'.
- Input dir: controls whether B is added to or subtracted from A.
- Output S [3:0]: the resultant sum of A and the modified B.
- Output Cout [3:0]: the carry out from each bit's addition, used as the carry in for the next bit.
- Output overflow: indicates overflow, determined by XOR between Cout[2] and Cout[3].
In the module code, XOR operations first modify B as per 'dir'. Each resultant bit (net0-net3) along with appropriate carry (starting from 'dir' for the least significant bit) feeds into instantiated full_adders (FA0 to FA3). The resultant sum bits and carry out bits are collected in outputs S and Cout respectively. Overall, the module seamlessly combines arithmetic operations and bit manipulations to function as a versatile arithmetic unit adaptable to dual operations (addition or subtraction) based on control input.
