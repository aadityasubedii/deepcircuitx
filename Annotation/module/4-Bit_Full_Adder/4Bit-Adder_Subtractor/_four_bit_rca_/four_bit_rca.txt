The four_bit_rca module performs addition or subtraction on two 4-bit inputs, A and B, controlled by a single-bit 'dir'. It uses XOR gates to conditionally invert B based on 'dir', then processes each bit through instantiated full_adder modules. The resulting 4-bit sum and carry output, along with an overflow signal derived from the carry outputs, provide comprehensive arithmetic functionality.
