It takes two 4-bit inputs A and B, and an additional single-bit input 'dir'. Based on the value of 'dir', B is either added or subtracted from A. The carry output of each bit addition serves as the carry input to the next bit addition (ripple effect). The module outputs the 4-bit sum (S) and the carry out (Cout) of each full addition. Additionally, it computes an 'overflow' signal by XORing the carry out from the second last and the last full adder stages, indicating whether an overflow occurred during addition or subtraction."
