The testbench applies different sets of binary inputs represented by 'a' and 'b' to the four_bit_rca module under different modes controlled by the 'mode' signal. It monitors and displays outputs including result, carry-outs, and overflow indication for each set of inputs, allowing for evaluation of the four_bit_rca\u2019s behavior in simulating 4-bit addition or subtraction based on the mode.
