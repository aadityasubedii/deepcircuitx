The four_bit_rcaTB module acts as a testbench for verifying the arithmetic functionalities of the four_bit_rca module, specifically focusing on 4-bit addition and subtraction based on input mode. It uses register inputs 'a' and 'b' for operands, and 'mode' to toggle between addition (0) and subtraction (1), and monitors outputs 'result', 'cout', and 'ovfl' to validate operation correctness. Functionality is tested through a sequence of initial blocks that systematically alter inputs to cover different operational scenarios, ensuring comprehensive verification of the arithmetic module under test.
