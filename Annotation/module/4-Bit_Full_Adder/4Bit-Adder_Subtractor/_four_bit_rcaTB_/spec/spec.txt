Module name: four_bit_rcaTB. Module specification: The four_bit_rcaTB module serves as a testbench for the four_bit_rca module, specifically designed to execute and verify the arithmetic operations (addition or subtraction) performed on 4-bit binary inputs. The inputs to this testbench include two 4-bit registers 'a' and 'b', which represent the operands, and a single-bit register 'mode' that dictates the operation: '0' for addition and '1' for subtraction. The outputs are a 4-bit wire 'result', which holds the computed result, and a 4-bit wire 'cout', where each bit carries out from each bit position and 'cout[3]' represents the most significant carry out. Additionally, a single-bit wire 'ovfl' indicates an overflow condition signaling an arithmetic operation exceeding the representable range. Internally, these signals are interfaced with the four_bit_rca module using respective ports. The Verilog code is structured into several initial blocks: the first block initializes the monitoring of these signals, displaying them for debugging and verification purposes, while the subsequent blocks sequentially apply different sets of binary inputs to test various scenarios and observe the behaviors of addition and subtraction operations. These test sequences are vital in assessing the correctness and performance of the connected four_bit_rca module under different input conditions.
