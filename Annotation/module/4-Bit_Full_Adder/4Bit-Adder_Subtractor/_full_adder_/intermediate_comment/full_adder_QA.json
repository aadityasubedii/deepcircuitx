The sum bit 'S' is calculated using the XOR operation on all three inputs, and the carry-out bit 'Cout' is derived using the logical OR operation on the combination of AND operations between each pair of inputs. This module is crucial for constructing arithmetic circuits that perform addition operations."

The output 'Cout' or carry-out bit, derived from the combinations of AND and OR operations between the inputs, indicates if there is a carry resulting from the addition that should be added to the next higher bit place in multi-bit addition scenarios."

The computation for the sum (S) and the carry-out (Cout) directly employs the input signals (A, B, Cin) to generate outputs, using basic logical operations without the need for any additional internal storage or signal manipulation. This simplicity ensures minimal latency and direct dependence on input changes."
