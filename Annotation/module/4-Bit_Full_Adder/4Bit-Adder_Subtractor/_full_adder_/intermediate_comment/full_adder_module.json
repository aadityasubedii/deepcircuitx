    "module": "The full_adder module performs binary addition of three input bits (A, B, Cin), outputting the sum (S) and carry-out (Cout). The sum S is computed using an XOR operation among all input bits, while Cout is derived from the OR operation of the AND combinations of input pairs, enabling effective chaining in multi-bit addition without internal state or delays."
