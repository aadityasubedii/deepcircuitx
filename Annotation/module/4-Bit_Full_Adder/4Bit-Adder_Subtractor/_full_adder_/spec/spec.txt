Module name: full_adder. Module specification: The "full_adder" module is designed to perform binary addition on three input bits: A, B, and Cin (carry-in). It outputs two bits: S (sum) and Cout (carry-out). The input 'A' and 'B' are the primary bits for the addition, while 'Cin' is used for cascading full adders in multi-bit arithmetic operations. The output 'S' is the resultant sum bit computed as the XOR of all three input bits, whereas 'Cout' is the carry-out bit calculated using the OR operation of the AND combinations of each pair of input bits (A & B, A & Cin, and B & Cin). This module does not utilize internal signals or registers, aiming to minimize latency by directly processing the inputs through basic logical operations. The Verilog code is organized into declarations of inputs and outputs followed by assignments for 'S' and 'Cout', clearly reflecting the simplicity and direct logic application consistent with a full adder's typical functionality.
