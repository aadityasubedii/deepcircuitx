    "module": "This Verilog snippet manages the conditional compilation of Verilog files for different simulation or synthesis scenarios based on the `GL` macro. If `GL` is defined, gate-level files from a specific directory are included, which is useful for detailed gate simulations. Otherwise, behavioral-level files are included for general RTL simulations, thereby tailoring file inclusions to the design's current phase without defining specific module interfaces or internal signals."
