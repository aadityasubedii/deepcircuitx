This configuration is set up to manage file inclusion during preprocessing stages based on the `GL` macro definition, which presumably stands for \"Gate-Level.\" If `GL` is defined, it includes gate-level versions of `user_project_wrapper` and `user_proj_example` from the \"gl\" directory, adaptively utilizing `default_nettype wire` to declare default net type settings for these inclusions which are commonly useful in gate-level simulations for pin and wire mapping. Conversely, if `GL` is not defined, it includes behavioral or RTL-level versions of these files from the main directory, typically suited for simulations where detailed gate-level information is not required. The primary component of the code is the use of conditional directives (`ifdef`, `else`, `endif`) to switch between these inclusion scenarios, ensuring appropriate file inclusion based on the design phase needs (like simulation versus synthesis).
