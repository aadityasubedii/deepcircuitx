Module Name: Not explicitly defined.

Module Specification: 
The provided code snippet does not delineate a specific hardware module but focuses on the framework for conditional compilation within a Verilog environment. This configuration is set up to manage file inclusion during preprocessing stages based on the `GL` macro definition, which presumably stands for "Gate-Level." If `GL` is defined, it includes gate-level versions of `user_project_wrapper` and `user_proj_example` from the "gl" directory, adaptively utilizing `default_nettype wire` to declare default net type settings for these inclusions which are commonly useful in gate-level simulations for pin and wire mapping. Conversely, if `GL` is not defined, it includes behavioral or RTL-level versions of these files from the main directory, typically suited for simulations where detailed gate-level information is not required. The primary component of the code is the use of conditional directives (`ifdef`, `else`, `endif`) to switch between these inclusion scenarios, ensuring appropriate file inclusion based on the design phase needs (like simulation versus synthesis). No explicit input or output ports or internal signals are utilized in the snippet, as the primary purpose of the code segment is to manage the conditional compilation environment rather than defining a specific module's interfacing or internal logistics.
