Module name: user_project_wrapper. Module specification: The 'user_project_wrapper' module acts as an intermediary for interfacing the system bus with the 'user_proj_example' submodule and configuring general and analog I/O connections. It supports parameterization through the 'BITS' parameter which defines the data bus width, and conditionally includes power pins controlled by the `USE_POWER_PINS` macro. The module contains input ports such as `wb_clk_i` for the Wishbone clock, `wb_rst_i` for system reset, Wishbone signals (`wbs_stb_i`, `wbs_cyc_i`, `wbs_we_i`, `wbs_sel_i`, `wbs_dat_i`, `wbs_adr_i`), Logic Analyzer ports (`la_data_in`, `la_oenb`), general I/O (`io_in`), analog I/O (`analog_io`), and an additional user clock `user_clock2`. Output ports include `wbs_ack_o`, `wbs_dat_o` for the Wishbone transaction acknowledgments and data output, Logic Analyzer output `la_data_out`, general I/O outputs (`io_out`, `io_oeb`), and user interrupts `user_irq`. The module does not employ internal signals beyond direct connections and mappings from these external ports to the 'user_proj_example' submodule or vice versa. This structural simplicity emphasizes its role as a passthrough entity facilitating communication and configuration without additional processing or state management.
