    "module": "The 'user_project_wrapper' facilitates communication between the system bus and a user-defined project by acting as a conduit for signal interfacing and managing configurations. It carries various types of I/O including Wishbone interface signals, Logic Analyzer ports, general I/O pads, and analog I/O. The module forwards these signals directly to and from the 'user_proj_example' submodule, supporting additional configurations for power pins and utilizing macros for conditional compilation."
