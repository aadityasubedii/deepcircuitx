    "module": "The user_proj_example module interfaces with a system bus and a logic analyzer to facilitate data IO operations and debugging in hardware setups. It handles bus transaction signals for read/write operations, uses internal counters for data handling, and outputs data based on the system's state and configuration. Key components include dynamically sourced clock and reset signals, configurable bit-width operations, and specific data routing for the logic analyzer to assist in real-time debugging and signal management."
