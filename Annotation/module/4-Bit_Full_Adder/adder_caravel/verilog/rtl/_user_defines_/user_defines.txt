This Verilog header file outlines configuration settings for GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins, prescribing numerous operational modes to facilitate systematic initialization and management within a larger system. It employs macros to define various GPIO modes such as input, output, bidirectional, and analog settings, alongside initializing a range of GPIO pins to a default invalid state.
