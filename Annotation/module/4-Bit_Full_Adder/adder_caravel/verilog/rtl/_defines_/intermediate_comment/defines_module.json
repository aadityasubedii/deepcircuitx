    "module": "This Verilog snippet configures global settings for a larger design, using macros to define constants for pad counts, memory configurations, and initial settings. It facilitates parameter consistency across multiple modules by setting up numerical values and flags in preprocessor directives that influence implementation across the design, without defining any module structure or internal signals."
