Module name: user_project_wrapper

Module specification: The 'user_project_wrapper' module serves as a comprehensive interface layer designed to adapt various input, output, and bi-directional signals for an embedded user project referred to as 'user_proj_example'. It is designed to work within a system that includes digital and analog circuits, together with a Wishbone bus interface. This module inputs several power supplies (`vccd1`, `vccd2` for digital circuits and `vdda1`, `vdda2` for analog circuits), grounding references (`vssa1`, `vssa2` for analog, `vssd1`, `vssd2` for digital), a user-defined clock (`user_clock2`), standard Wishbone signals (like `wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i` for bus timing and control, `wbs_adr_i`, `wbs_dat_i`, `wbs_we_i` for data handling), and various data-signaling ports (`io_in`, `la_data_in` for inputs, `io_out`, `la_data_out` for outputs, with respective enable signals `io_oeb`, `la_oenb`). These components are all interfaced and adapted to the needs of the 'user_proj_example' project instantiated within. The module uses internal mapping of these signals to ensure correct order and enablement for the wrapped project, including manipulation of generic input/output signals, data for a logic analyzer, and Wishbone bus interfaces. The output ports of this module include an acknowledgment signal (`wbs_ack_o`) for the Wishbone bus, output control for general IO (`io_oeb`), output data signals (`io_out`), processed data output from a logic analyzer (`la_data_out`), interrupt outputs (`user_irq`), and the data output for the Wishbone bus (`wbs_dat_o`). The highly organized signal mapping and routing within this module showcase its role in aligning interface standards among different subsystems within a larger integrated circuit or SoC environment.
