This module serves as a wrapper for a user project, integrating it into a larger system with Wishbone bus interface. It adapts various input/output signals, including power supplies, clocks, resets, and data lines, to the needs of the internal 'user_proj_example' module. The wrapper maps and routes signals between the system-level interface and the user project, handling general I/O, logic analyzer data, interrupts, and Wishbone bus transactions, thus providing a standardized interface for the custom user project within the system-on-chip environment.
