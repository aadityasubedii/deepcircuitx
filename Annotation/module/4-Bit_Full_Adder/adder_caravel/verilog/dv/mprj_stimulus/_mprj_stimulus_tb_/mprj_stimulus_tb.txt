The mprj_stimulus_tb module serves as a testbench designed to validate the functionality of an SoC implemented within the Caravel harness by providing IO stimuli and observing system responses. It utilizes input ports for power, reset, clock, and chip selection to control the pacing and initiation of operations, alongside SPI interfaces for external memory interactions. Output ports monitor the systemâ€™s responses, and internal signals represent various voltage and ground levels ensuring realistic power conditions. The module robustly tests device behavior using blocks for clock manipulations, condition checks via `checkbits` and `status`, all facilitated by a gated and conditionally annotated simulation environment to handle real-time delays and constraints.
