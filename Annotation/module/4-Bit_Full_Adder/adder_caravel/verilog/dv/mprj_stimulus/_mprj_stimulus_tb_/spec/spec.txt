Module name: mprj_stimulus_tb. 
Module specification: The "mprj_stimulus_tb" is a testbench for validating the functionality of a system-on-chip (SoC) design when integrated with the Caravel harness, focusing on IO stimulation and behavior observation under specified conditions. It includes input ports such as `clock` (main timing control), `RSTB` (active-low reset), `power1` and `power2` (power simulation inputs), and `CSB` (chip select control), along with SPI flash memory interfaces (`flash_csb`, `flash_clk`, `flash_io0`, `flash_io1`). The module outputs signals through `gpio`, a general-purpose IO signal reflecting the system's state, and `mprj_io`, a multibit port managing a wide range of IO signals. Additionally, `checkbits` and `status`, extracted from `mprj_io`, are used to validate data patterns and system statuses respectively.

Internal signals such as `VDD3V3` and `VDD1V8` simulate different voltage levels necessary for the Caravel chip operation, while `VSS` represents the ground level. The test utilizes a Caravel unit instantiation (`uut`) and an SPI flash memory module (`spiflash`). The testbench includes various simulation blocks: one adjusting the chip's reset and selection statuses, one managing power application, a block for standard delay format (SDF) annotations if `ENABLE_SDF` is defined, and a principal block that checks for specific conditions in `checkbits` and `status`.

Various simulation control statements (`always`, `initial`) handle clock signal generation, initialization sequences, and simulation-specific checks, including timeout handling and condition-based progression with displays for monitoring. This structure aids in simulating real-time scenarios and verifying the chip's response to diverse test conditions and stimuli accurately.
