The `io_ports_tb` module serves as a testbench for validating the I/O functionalities of the `caravel` chip, focusing on signal synchronization, reset operations, and multi-condition power handling. It leverages internal signals for SPI communication and power management, while employing sequential drive and monitoring of output ports through initial blocks, always constructs, and an instantiation of the system chip with associated SDF timing constraints for precise operation tests.
