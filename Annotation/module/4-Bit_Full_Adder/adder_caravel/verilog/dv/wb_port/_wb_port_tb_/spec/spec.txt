Module name: wb_port_tb. Module specification: The `wb_port_tb` module serves as a testbench designed to validate the integration and functionality of the "caravel" microchip using the Wishbone bus architecture within FPGA and ASIC systems. It is equipped with input ports including `clock`, for driving the simulation; `RSTB`, an active-low reset signal; `CSB`, an active-low chip select signal; and `power1`, `power2`, `power3`, `power4`, for simulating power supply inputs across various voltage domains. The output ports are `gpio`, a general-purpose I/O interface; a wide multi-purpose I/O interface `mprj_io`; a specific subset of `mprj_io`, `mprj_io_0`; and `checkbits` used for observing specific statuses during testbench operations. Internal signals such as `flash_csb`, `flash_clk`, `flash_io0`, and `flash_io1` are connected to an SPI flash memory, with power supply and ground signals defined distinctly for various sections of the microchip. The module is sectioned into various initialization and configuration procedural blocks, simulation of power-up sequences, loading of SDF files for accurate timing analysis through conditional compilation, detailed pin assignments for the caravel instance, and interfacing with SPI flash memory. Overall, these elements aim to provide a robust testing environment, mimicking real-world scenarios to ensure the microchip meets design specifications under varied conditions.
