    "module": "The `wb_port_tb` module is a testbench designed to verify the integration and functionality of the \"caravel\" microchip within a Wishbone bus architecture, focusing on FPGA and ASIC systems. It simulates various operational scenarios using input signals such as clock, reset, chip select, and multiple power supplies to evaluate different power domains. Outputs include general and multi-purpose I/O interfaces and specific checkbits for monitoring conditions. Implementation involves initializing and timing sequences, SPI flash interaction, conditional Standard Delay Format (SDF) file loading for timing accuracy, and dedicated procedural blocks to manage state transitions and observe system behavior."
