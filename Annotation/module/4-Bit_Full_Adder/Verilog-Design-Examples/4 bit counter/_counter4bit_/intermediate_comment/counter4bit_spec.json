    "spec": "Module name: counter4bit. \nModule specification: The counter4bit module is designed for managing a 4-bit count through sequenced state transitions in a predefined cycle (S0 to S13), controlled by input signals and internal logic. It processes input signals: 'reset' (active-high to reinitialize the count to state S0 irrespective of other signal states), 'load' (allows for the loading of a new state from the predefined sequence when high), 'enable' (updates the 'count_out' to reflect 'count' when high, otherwise maintains the current count), and 'clk' (clock signal triggering state transitions on its rising edge). The outputs are 'count_out' (4-bit register outputting the current count state) and 'count' (4-bit register holding the next sequential state). Internally, 'count_out' captures and outputs the current counter state triggered by 'reset' or updated by 'enable', while 'count' registers the determined next state in sequence or resets based on 'load'. The module includes two primary always blocks: the first being sensitive to both the positive edge of 'clk' and 'reset'\u2014responsible for conditionally resetting or updating 'count_out', and the second sensitive solely to the positive edge of 'clk' \u2014 managing the conditional updating of 'count' based on 'load' and 'enable', and handling 'count_out' when not enabled. This setup allows the counter to handle reset conditions, pausing, and state advances with robust control across various signal conditions.",

It performs sequential state transitions through predefined states (S0 to S13) upon receiving appropriate clock (clk) and control signals (reset, load, and enable). When reset is activated, the count restarts from state S0. If both load and enable are high, the count transitions through a predefined sequence based on the current state.

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: reset, load, enable, clk.\nExplanation:\n- **reset**: This is an active-high signal used to reset the count to the initial state (S0). When this signal is high, regardless of other signals, the count output is set to the initial state.\n- **load**: This signal, when high, allows the counter to load the next state based on the current value of count_out. If low, it forces the count to reset to S0 unless enable is also low.\n- **enable**: This signal permits the counter to update count_out to the value stored in count if high. If this signal is low, the count_out retains its current value, effectively pausing the advancement of the counter.\n- **clk**: Clock input which triggers the state transitions on its rising edge. The positive edge of the clock is used to evaluate and update the states of count_out and count based on the logic defined in the always blocks.\n\nOutput ports: count_out, count.\nExplanation:\n- **count_out**: This is a 4-bit output that holds the current state of the counter. It updates either to reflect a reset state or follows the count based on the conditions provided by the enable and load inputs.\n- **count**: This is a 4-bit output representing the next state of the counter. Based on the current state in count_out and if the load and enable conditions are met, count moves sequentially through the defined states from S0 up to S13, then wraps around to S0."

It is updated either when the reset signal is high, directly setting it to the initial predefined state (S0), or when the enable signal is high, in which it mirrors the transitions of the count register based on the current state. This signal outputs the state that is evaluated at each positive edge of the clock.\n\n- **count**: This 4-bit internal register determines and holds the next state of the counter. It is conditionally updated during the positive clock edge when both load and enable inputs are high. The update follows a predetermined sequence through the states S0 to S13. If the sequence reaches S13, it wraps around back to S0. If the load signal is low, count is reset to S0, ensuring a reinitialization of the sequence whenever needed. This internal signal is critical for defining the future state transition dependent upon the current state held in count_out."
