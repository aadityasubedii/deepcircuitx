Module name: counter4bit. 
Module specification: The counter4bit module is designed for managing a 4-bit count through sequenced state transitions in a predefined cycle (S0 to S13), controlled by input signals and internal logic. It processes input signals: 'reset' (active-high to reinitialize the count to state S0 irrespective of other signal states), 'load' (allows for the loading of a new state from the predefined sequence when high), 'enable' (updates the 'count_out' to reflect 'count' when high, otherwise maintains the current count), and 'clk' (clock signal triggering state transitions on its rising edge). The outputs are 'count_out' (4-bit register outputting the current count state) and 'count' (4-bit register holding the next sequential state). Internally, 'count_out' captures and outputs the current counter state triggered by 'reset' or updated by 'enable', while 'count' registers the determined next state in sequence or resets based on 'load'. The module includes two primary always blocks: the first being sensitive to both the positive edge of 'clk' and 'reset'—responsible for conditionally resetting or updating 'count_out', and the second sensitive solely to the positive edge of 'clk' — managing the conditional updating of 'count' based on 'load' and 'enable', and handling 'count_out' when not enabled. This setup allows the counter to handle reset conditions, pausing, and state advances with robust control across various signal conditions.
