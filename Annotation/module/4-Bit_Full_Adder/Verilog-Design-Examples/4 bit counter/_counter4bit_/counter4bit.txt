The counter4bit module manages a 4-bit sequential counter advancing through predefined states (S0 to S13) based on control inputs. It resets to S0 on a high 'reset', sequences states on 'clk' edges if 'load' and 'enable' are high, maintains current state if 'enable' is low, and resets on 'load' being low. Two always blocks handle the reset/update logic for 'count_out' and state sequencing in 'count'.
