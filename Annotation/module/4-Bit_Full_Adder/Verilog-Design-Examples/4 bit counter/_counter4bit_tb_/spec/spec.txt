Module name: counter4bit_tb. Module specification: The 'counter4bit_tb' module is a testbench designed to verify the functionality of a 4-bit counter module named 'counter4bit'. It tests the counter's reaction to input signals such as reset, load, enable, and clock (clk) by setting these controls and observing the output. Input ports include reset for initializing the counter, load for loading a new count value, enable for starting or stopping the counter, and clk for synchronizing operations. The outputs are count_out, reflecting the current state of the counter, and count, an internal verification signal. The module uses an internal signal, new_count, a register holding expected values to verify the counter's operation against. It simulates various operation scenarios by toggling input signals and utilizes an always block to check the congruence between new_count and count_out, displaying "Pass" or "Fail". Moreover, initial blocks are used to generate the clock signal and to set or reset other inputs over time, thus orchestrating the test procedure.
