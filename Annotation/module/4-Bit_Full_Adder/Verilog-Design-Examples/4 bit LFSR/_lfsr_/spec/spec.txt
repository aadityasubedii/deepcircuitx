Module name: lfsr. Module specification: The 'lfsr' module is a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) designed to generate a pseudo-random sequence of 4-bit data outputs. The module has two input ports: 'reset' and 'clk'. The 'reset' input initializes the LFSR, setting the output 'data_out' to 1 when high or when 'data_out' is zero. The 'clk' input is a clock signal that controls the timing of state updates, triggering computations at each positive edge. The output port 'data_out' is a 4-bit register that holds and outputs the current state of the LFSR, updating this state based on internal logic. Internally, the module uses a wire signal 'next_bit', which is the XOR of the least significant bit (data_out[0]) and the second least significant bit (data_out[1]) of 'data_out'. This signal is essential for the LFSR's feedback mechanism, dictating the state's evolution by being shifted into the most significant bit position during state updates. The Verilog code segment that operates on the positive edge of 'clk' checks if a reset condition is applied; if not, it uses 'next_bit' and the current state of 'data_out' to calculate the next state, ensuring continuous generation of pseudo-random data sequences. This design effectively demonstrates the use of conditional statements and bitwise operations to achieve desired functional behaviors in hardware description languages.
