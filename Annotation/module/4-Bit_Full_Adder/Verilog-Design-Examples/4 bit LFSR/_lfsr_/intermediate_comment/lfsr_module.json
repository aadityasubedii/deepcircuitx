    "module": "The 'lfsr' module implements a linear feedback shift register that generates a 4-bit pseudo-random sequence, updating its state with each positive edge of the clock signal ('clk'). Functionality is governed by 'reset' and 'clk' inputs\u2014with 'reset' initiating a default state\u2014and uses internal XOR of the two least significant bits of 'data_out' to compute the most significant bit during left shifts, ensuring dynamic sequence generation."
