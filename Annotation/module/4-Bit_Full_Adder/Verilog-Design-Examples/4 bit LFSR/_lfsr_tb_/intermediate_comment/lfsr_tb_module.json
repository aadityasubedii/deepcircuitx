    "module": "The `lfsr_tb` module serves as a test bench for verifying a linear feedback shift register (LFSR), comparing its output against a simulated equivalent. It uses a clock signal to drive the test sequences and a reset signal for initialization. On each clock edge, it updates a simulated LFSR output (`new_out`) using internal feedback (`new_bit`), checks for equivalence with the module output (`data_out`), and reports the pass or fail status. The test operates over defined time cycles, concluding automatically."
