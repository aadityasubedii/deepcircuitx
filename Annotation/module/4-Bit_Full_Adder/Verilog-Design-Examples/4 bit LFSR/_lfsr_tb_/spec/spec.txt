Module name: lfsr_tb. Module specification: The `lfsr_tb` is a Verilog test bench designed to validate the operation of a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). It comprises two primary input ports: `reset`, which initializes the internal state, and `clk`, which is a clock signal driving the timing of operations. The output port `data_out` is a 4-bit signal reflecting the LFSR output under test. Internally, `new_out` is a 4-bit register that simulates an LFSR sequence, employing a feedback signal `new_bit` calculated as the XOR of the two least significant bits of `new_out`. The `lfsr_tb` contains multiple initial blocks managing signal initialization and simulation termination, and one always block that handles the simulation of `new_out` and feedback comparison at each clock's positive edge. The test outputs whether the LFSR operates as expected by comparing `new_out` with `data_out` at each cycle, marking a testcase as "Pass" or "Fail" accordingly. The entire test runs for 400 time units post the initial reset period.
