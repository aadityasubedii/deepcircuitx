Module name: dualport_ram. 
Module specification: The dualport_ram module is designed to facilitate independent dual-port access to an implemented random access memory (RAM), where each port can read from or write to the memory independently, synchronized with a clock signal. The module includes input ports namely `clk` (the clock signal ensuring synchronized operations), `wr_en_a` and `wr_en_b` (write enable signals for ports A and B, allowing data writing when high), `addr_a` and `addr_b` (address inputs specifying the memory location), and `data_in_a` and `data_in_b` (data inputs for ports A and B). The output ports are `data_out_a` and `data_out_b`, which output data read from the specified memory addresses unless data is being written to those addresses. Internally, the module utilizes a `ram_vector`, an 8-element array of 128-bit registers representing the memory, and `read_addr_a` and `read_addr_b`, which are registers intended to hold the read addresses for each port but are not used in the current implementation. The code is structured into two main always blocks triggered on the positive edge of the clk signal, each handling the write or read logic for the respective ports, ensuring that data is either written to or read from the RAM depending on the state of the write enable signals.
