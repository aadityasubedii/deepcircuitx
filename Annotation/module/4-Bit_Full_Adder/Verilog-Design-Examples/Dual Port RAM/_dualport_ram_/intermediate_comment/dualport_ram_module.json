    "module": "The dualport_ram module implements a dual-port RAM where each port can independently read or write, synchronized with a clock signal. It handles data inputs and write enable signals for two ports, directing data to specified memory addresses during write operations or retrieving data during read operations. The module uses a memory vector to store and retrieve 128-bit data values and operates based on the rising edge of the clock, managing data flow through conditional checks on write enable signals for atomic read or write actions."
