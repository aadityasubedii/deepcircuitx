It has two data input ports (`data_in_a` and `data_in_b`), two write enable signals (`wr_en_a` and `wr_en_b`), and two address inputs (`addr_a` and `addr_b`). If the write enable signal for a port is active (high), the module writes the data from the corresponding input port (`data_in_a` or `data_in_b`) into the memory at the address specified (`addr_a` or `addr_b`). If the write enable is not active, it reads data from the specified memory address into corresponding output ports (`data_out_a` or `data_out_b`). The entire process is synchronized to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`."
