Module name: dualportram_tb.

Module specification: The 'dualportram_tb' module is a testbench for simulating and verifying a dual-port RAM module, specifically designed to check its functionality when both ports 'A' and 'B' are used independently for read and write operations. The module includes input ports such as 'clk', 'wr_en_a', 'wr_en_b' (write enables for ports A and B), 'addr_a', 'addr_b' (address inputs for ports A and B), and 'data_in_a', 'data_in_b' (data inputs for ports A and B). The output ports, 'data_out_a' and 'data_out_b', are used to output the data read from the corresponding ports. Internal signals within the module involve 'ram_vector', an 8-element array of 128-bit vectors that acts as the memory storage, and 'out_a', 'out_b', which are used to temporarily store the data read from the memory during test operations. The module is structured into several blocks including initial setups for generating clock signals and managing simulation duration, a stimulus task that randomly generates addresses and data inputs while toggling write enable signals, and checks to validate the integrity of data stored and retrieved from the RAM. Additional conditional checks manage address conflicts when both ports access the same address simultaneously, ensuring the correct and latest write operation is represented on the outputs.
