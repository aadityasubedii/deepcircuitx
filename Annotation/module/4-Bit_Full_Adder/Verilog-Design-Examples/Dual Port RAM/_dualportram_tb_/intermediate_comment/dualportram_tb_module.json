    "module": "The 'dualportram_tb' module is a testbench for validating the dual-port RAM handling independent read and write operations on ports A and B. It simulates clock-driven memory interaction using random data and addresses, toggling write enables, and storing data in an internal memory model 'ram_vector'. The module monitors data integrity by comparing expected outputs against actual, managing simultaneous port access conflicts, and ensuring the latest write prevails with output verification."
