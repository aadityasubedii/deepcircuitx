The testbench simulates different operational scenarios for the shift register by setting the `control` signals, which determine the type of shift operation (e.g., no operation, circular right shift, circular left shift, load new data). The testbench checks the functionality by comparing the expected output `new_out` with the actual output `data_out` from the `univ_shift` module, printing the pass or fail status based on this comparison. The operations are synchronized using a clock signal `clk` and can be reset with a `reset` signal. The testbench sequences include setting initial input values, toggling the reset signal, and generating random control signals at each positive clock edge."

It dictates when data manipulations and checks are performed.\n- `reset`: A signal to reset the operations in the universal shift register. When asserted, it may be used to clear the register or bring the system to a predefined state.\n- `control`: This input is used to select the type of operation or shifting to be performed on `data_in`. Different values of this control input determine different modes of operations like no shift, circular shifts, or loading new data.\n\nOutput ports: `data_out`.\nExplanation:\n- `data_out`: This port represents the output from the universal shift register.

It is used as a reference in the testbench to verify the correctness of the output `data_out` from the `univ_shift` module. During each clock cycle, `new_out` is computed anew depending on the operation specified by the `control` inputs. If the `reset` signal is asserted, `new_out` is cleared (set to 0). The different operations that dictate `new_out` value include no operation, circular shifts, and direct data load.
