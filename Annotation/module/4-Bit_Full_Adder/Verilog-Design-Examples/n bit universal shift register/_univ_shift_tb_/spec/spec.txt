Module name: univ_shift_tb. Module specification: The `univ_shift_tb` module is a testbench designed to verify the functionality of the `univ_shift` module, which is a universal shift register capable of performing various shift operations. The testbench contains input ports: `data_in` for feeding binary data to be manipulated, `clk` for clock signal synchronization, `reset` for returning the shift register to its initial state, and `control` for selecting the shift operation mode. The output port `data_out` carries the results from the shift register. Internally, `new_out` is used to store expected results for verifying against the `data_out`. The code includes several blocks: an initialization block setting initial values and clock behavior, test control scenarios via the `stimulus` task generating random `control` values, and a sequential logic block checking whether the shift operations performed match expected outcomes, logging results accordingly. Additionally, necessary testing terminations are defined at a set simulation time. This organization allows comprehensive testing and validation of the shift register under varied conditions and control settings.
