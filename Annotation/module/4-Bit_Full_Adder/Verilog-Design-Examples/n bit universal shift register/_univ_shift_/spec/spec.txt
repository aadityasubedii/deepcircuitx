Module name: univ_shift. Module specification: The 'univ_shift' module, parameterized for an n-bit width and developed in Verilog, is designed to perform various data manipulation operations such as holding current data, shifting left, shifting right, or loading new data determined by a control input on an n-bit input 'data_in'. The module operates with four main inputs and one output: 'data_in' (n-bit input for data operations), 'clk' (clock signal for synchronous operation updates), 'reset' (asynchronous reset to clear output data), and 'control' (2-bit signal defining the operation mode). The output is 'data_out', which is an n-bit register reflecting the result from the performed operation. Internally, the module uses these ports along with parameter definitions for operation modes (hold, shift_left, shift_right, siso) to control the behavior of the output based on the input conditions. The primary functionality is encapsulated within an always block sensitive to the positive edge of the 'clk' and the negative edge of the 'reset'. When reset is active, 'data_out' is cleared to zero. Otherwise, based on the 'control' signal, operations like data hold, left shift, right shift, or data load are executed. This block effectively captures the reactive behavior of the module, ensuring data_out is updated appropriately each clock cycle or reset condition.
