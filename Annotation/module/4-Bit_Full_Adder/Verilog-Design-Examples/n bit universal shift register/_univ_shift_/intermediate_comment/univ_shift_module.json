    "module": "The 'univ_shift' module is a universal n-bit shifter that performs operations like hold, shift left, shift right, or load new data on 'data_in' based on the 'control' signal. It operates synchronously with a clock 'clk', and provides an option to reset the output 'data_out' asynchronously using the 'reset' signal. The core functionality is implemented in an always block triggering on positive 'clk' edges or negative 'reset' edges, with a case statement managing the operation specified by 'control'."
