It processes the input data based on a control signal 'control'. The module supports various operations such as holding the current value, shifting left, shifting right, and loading a new value from 'data_in'. The outcome of these operations is assigned to the output 'data_out'. The operation is selected by the 'control' signal. The module is sensitive to the positive edge of the 'clk' and the negative edge of the 'reset'. When 'reset' is active, 'data_out' is cleared to 0. If not reset, the action specified by the 'control' is performed each clock cycle."

It directs how the `data_out` should be updated based on the operation specified.\n- 'data_in': This is an n-bit internal signal that serves as the primary input data to the module.

The processing of data based on the 'control' signal action happens at these positive clock edges.\n- 'reset': This signal is used to asynchronously clear `data_out` to 0 when it is active at a negative edge. This ensures that the output can be reset regardless of the state of other signals.\n- 'data_out': This is an n-bit register (output register) that holds the result of the operation performed on `data_in`.
