The FIFO can accept 8-bit data inputs (using `data_in`). The functionality includes writing data to a memory buffer when enabled (`write_en` is high) provided it's not full, and reading data from the buffer when enabled (`read_en` is high) provided it's not empty. The FIFO uses pointers to manage read and write positions (`write_ptr` and `read_ptr`) within a small circular buffer, and it tracks the count of items in the buffer to set flags for full or empty states (`mem_full` and `mem_empty`). The operation respects asynchronous reset (`reset`) which sets pointers and count to zero."
