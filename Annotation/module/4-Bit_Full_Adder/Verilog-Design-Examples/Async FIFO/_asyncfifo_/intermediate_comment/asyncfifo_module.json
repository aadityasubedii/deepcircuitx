    "module": "The asyncfifo module is an asynchronous FIFO buffer supporting separate read and write operations across different clock domains. It facilitates data transfer with input control and data signals, signaling full or empty states through output flags, and manages data flow using internal buffers and pointers. The module leverages edge-triggered events and an asynchronous reset to handle state initialization and dynamic read/write operations, ensuring robust inter-clock-domain communication."
