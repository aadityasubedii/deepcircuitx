Module name: asyncfifo. 
Module specification: The asyncfifo is an asynchronous First In, First Out (FIFO) module designed for operations between two different clock domains, utilizing separate clocks for reading (`read_clk`) and writing (`write_clk`). It manages 8-bit data inputs (`data_in`) through control signals including a write enable (`write_en`) and a read enable (`read_en`). The FIFO features output ports `mem_full` and `mem_empty` that signal the buffer's full and empty states respectively, and an output data port (`out`) which provides the data read from the FIFO. Internally, the module uses a memory array `mem` consisting of 8 elements each 8 bits wide to store data, with `write_ptr` and `read_ptr` pointers to track the write and read positions respectively. A 4-bit `count` maintains the number of items in the FIFO. The module's code is divided into three primary blocks: one handling write operations and managing the write pointer and output state on the rising edge of `write_clk` or on a reset condition, another for read operations adjusting the read pointer and setting the output data on the rising edge of `read_clk` or during a reset, and a third monitoring both read and write events to adjust the count of items within the FIFO on changes in either clock or a reset. The operation of the FIFO takes into consideration an asynchronous `reset` signal which sets the pointers and count to their initial states.
