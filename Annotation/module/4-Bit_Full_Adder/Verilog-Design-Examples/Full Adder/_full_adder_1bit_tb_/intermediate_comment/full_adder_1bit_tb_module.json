    "module": "The `full_adder_1bit_tb` module serves as a testbench for validating the `full_adder_1bit` by generating random input vectors (`a`, `b`, `cin`) and comparing computed outputs (`sum`, `carry`) against expected values (`new_sum`, `new_carry`). It employs a repetitive test structure where the `stimulus` task updates input signals, calculates expected results, and checks these results against the outputs from the full adder, reporting success or failure for each of the 100 iterations."
