Its primary function is to verify the accuracy of the full adder by generating randomized inputs (`a`, `b`, `cin`) and comparing the computed sums (`sum`, `carry`) from the Device Under Test (DUT) with an independently calculated value (`new_sum`, `new_carry`). These comparisons are repeated 100 times, and the results (pass or fail) are displayed after each test iteration. The module ensures that the full adder operates correctly across a range of input conditions."

These values are computed by adding the binary value of inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin` (`{new_carry, new_sum} = A + B + Cin;`). Subsequently, they are compared against the actual outputs (`sum`, `carry`) from the Device Under Test (DUT) to check if the full adder operates as intended.
