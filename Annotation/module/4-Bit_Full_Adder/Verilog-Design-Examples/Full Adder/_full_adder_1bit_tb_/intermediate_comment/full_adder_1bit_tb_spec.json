    "spec": "Module name: full_adder_1bit_tb. Module specification: The `full_adder_1bit_tb` is a testbench module designed to validate the functionality of a 1-bit full adder module named `full_adder_1bit`. It uses randomized test vectors generated within the testbench to repeatedly evaluate the behavior of the full adder under various input conditions. The testbench module primarily utilizes three input ports: `a`, `b`, and `cin`, which represent the single-bit inputs for the adder operation, including the carry-in bit, respectively. The results are output through two ports: `sum` and `carry`, which denote the result of the addition and the carry-out bit. Internally, the module computes expected sum and carry values using `new_sum` and `new_carry` signals, which are then compared against the outputs from the Device Under Test (DUT) to verify correctness. The testbench orchestrates this verification through a repeating block that generates random inputs, invokes the DUT, and checks the correctness of the DUT\u2019s outputs against the internally computed values. If the results match, a successful test message is displayed; otherwise, a failure message is logged. The process is managed through a `stimulus` task that is responsible for assigning random values to the input signals and computing the expected outputs. This structured and methodical approach ensures thorough validation of the 1-bit full adder\u2019s functionality over 100 test iterations.",

These values are computed by adding the binary value of inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin` (`{new_carry, new_sum} = A + B + Cin;`). Subsequently, they are compared against the actual outputs (`sum`, `carry`) from the Device Under Test (DUT) to check if the full adder operates as intended.
