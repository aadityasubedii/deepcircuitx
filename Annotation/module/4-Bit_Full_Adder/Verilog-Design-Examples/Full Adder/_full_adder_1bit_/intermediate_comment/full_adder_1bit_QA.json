It outputs two bits: o_sum, which is the sum of the inputs, and o_carry, which is the carry resulting from the addition. The sum (o_sum) is calculated using the XOR operation across all three inputs to determine if an odd number of inputs are high, which reflects binary addition. The carry out (o_carry) is determined by checking if at least two of the three input bits are high, which indicates an overflow or a need for a carry in binary addition."
