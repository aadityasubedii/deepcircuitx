    "module": "The `full_adder_1bit` module performs a one-bit addition, taking two primary bits (i_a, i_b) and a carry-in (i_cin) to produce a sum (o_sum) and a carry-out (o_carry). It calculates o_sum using an XOR operation among all inputs to reflect odd or even counts of '1's, while o_carry uses AND and OR gates to check if at least two inputs are high, indicating a carry for the next higher adder stage. This design ensures simplicity and efficiency for integration in larger binary addition systems."
