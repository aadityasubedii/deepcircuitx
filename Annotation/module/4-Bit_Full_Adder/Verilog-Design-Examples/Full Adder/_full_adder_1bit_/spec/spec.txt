Module name: full_adder_1bit. Module specification: The `full_adder_1bit` module is designed to perform a one-bit addition of three input bits: i_a, i_b, and i_cin, which include two primary bits and a carry-in bit from a previous addition. The module outputs two bits, o_sum and o_carry. Here, o_sum is the result of an XOR operation between all inputs, representing the binary sum, while o_carry is determined by an OR operation among the ANDs of each pair of inputs, indicating if a carry-out is generated for use in the next higher bit addition. This module employs direct combinational logic to derive outputs from inputs without any internal signals, effectively rendering the module straightforward and efficient for use in larger adder constructs. The Verilog code for this module features two main assignments: one for calculating the sum and the other for calculating the carry, leveraging basic logic gates to perform these operations efficiently and clearly.
