Module name: dff_async_tb. Module specification: The 'dff_async_tb' is a Verilog testbench module designed to validate the functionality of an asynchronous D Flip-Flop. It checks the flip-flop's ability to correctly latch and output a data input (d) upon a clock signal and to reset based on an asynchronous reset signal. The module utilizes input ports which include 'd' for the data input, 'clk' for the clock, and 'reset' for the asynchronous reset signal. The outputs, denoted 'q' and 'qb', are the main and complementary outputs of the D Flip-Flop, respectively. Internal signals such as 'd', 'clk', and 'reset' are used for simulating data and control inputs, while 'q' and 'qb' are monitored to verify the correct latching and complementary output behavior of the flip-flop. The module contains two initial blocks; one continuously toggles the clock signal to simulate a clock input and the other generates a series of randomized test cases using the 'stimulus' task. In each test case, based on the generated data and reset conditions, it assesses whether the outputs 'q' and 'qb' meet expected conditions. Successful or failed test conditions are then displayed, iterating through 100 cycles to ensure verification under a variety of randomized inputs.
