    "module": "The `dff_async` module implements an asynchronous reset D flip-flop, capturing input 'i_d' on a clock 'clk' rising edge and resetting the output 'o_q' to zero on a high 'reset' signal. It uses a procedural block sensitive to positive edges of `clk` and `reset` for conditional data capture or reset, and continuously assigns the inverse of `o_q` to `o_qb` to provide a complementary output."
