    "spec": "Module name: `dff_async`. Module specification: The `dff_async` module defines an asynchronous reset D flip-flop in Verilog. It captures the data input from the port `i_d` on the rising edge of the clock signal `clk`, and outputs it through the port `o_q`. If the reset signal `reset` is high, the output `o_q` is immediately set to 0, overriding any changes that might be triggered by the clock edge. This ensures the flip-flop can be reset asynchronously. Additionally, the module generates an inverted output `o_qb` of `o_q` using a continuous assignment statement. The key input ports include: `i_d`, the data to be captured; `clk`, the clock signal controlling the capturing of the data; and `reset`, the asynchronous reset signal. The output ports are `o_q`, which holds the captured or reset data, and `o_qb`, which provides the logical complement of `o_q`. Internally, `o_q` is implemented as a register to store the state between clock edges or resets. The code includes a main procedural block that specifies the behavior at the clock's rising edge or when the reset is activated, emphasizing its primary function in the storage and conditional resetting of the flip-flop's state. This straightforward yet essential functionality makes `dff_async` a crucial building block in digital circuit design, handling state storage and asynchronous operations effectively.",
