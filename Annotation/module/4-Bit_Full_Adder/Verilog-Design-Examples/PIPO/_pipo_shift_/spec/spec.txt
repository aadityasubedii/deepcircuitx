Module name: pipo_shift. Module specification: The 'pipo_shift' module is designed to function as a parallel-in parallel-out shift register that handles conditional shift operations based on the given controls. The module has several input ports including a 16-bit 'data_in' for the input data, a 'load' signal that when high enables the loading of 'data_in' into the internal register 'temp_data', a 'clk' signal which is the clock input triggering operations on its positive edge, a 'reset' signal that asynchronously clears the output 'data_out' to zero, and a 2-bit 'shift_en' which determines the type of shift operation (left, right, arithmetic left, arithmetic right) to perform. The output of the module is the 16-bit 'data_out', which holds the result of the shifting operation. Internally, 'temp_data' is used to store data temporarily from 'data_in' and serves as the operative data for shifting depending on the 'shift_en' signal setting. The Verilog code involves an always block that triggers on the positive edge of 'clk'. Within this block, if 'reset' is high, 'data_out' is cleared. Otherwise, if 'load' is high, 'data_in' is loaded into 'temp_data', followed by a case statement depending on 'shift_en' to execute the appropriate shift operation and storing the result in 'data_out'. This structure effectively allows for flexible data shifting operations within digital systems, controlled via straightforward signal inputs.
