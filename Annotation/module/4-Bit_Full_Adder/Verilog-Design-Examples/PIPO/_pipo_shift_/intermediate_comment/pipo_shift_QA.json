It takes a 16-bit input ('data_in') which can be loaded into an internal register ('temp_data') based on the 'load' signal. Based on the value of 'shift_en', which dictates the type of shift operation, the module can perform left shift, right shift, arithmetic left shift, or arithmetic right shift on 'temp_data'. The result is assigned to the 'data_out' register. The module operates on the positive edge of a clock signal ('clk') and can be reset asynchronously using the 'reset' signal, which clears 'data_out' to 0."

It inputs the data which can be loaded into the internal register `temp_data` when the `load` signal is active.\n- **load**: This input signal determines whether the data from the `data_in` port should be loaded into `temp_data`. When high, `data_in` is loaded into `temp_data`.\n- **clk**: This is the clock input to the module. It is used to trigger the operations inside the module on the positive edge of the clock signal.\n- **reset**: This asynchronous reset signal, when high, clears the output register `data_out` to 0, irrespective of the clock signal.\n- **shift_en**: This is a 2-bit input that controls the shift operation to be performed on `temp_data`. It decides whether a left shift, right shift, arithmetic left shift, or arithmetic right shift is performed.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation:\n- **data_out**: This is a 16-bit output register of the module. It holds the result of the shift operation performed on `temp_data` as dictated by the `shift_en` signal. It outputs the shifted data based on the selected mode of operation."
