Module name: vdcmul_2b. Module specification: The 'vdcmul_2b' module is a Verilog-based digital circuit designed to multiply two 2-bit binary numbers 'x' and 'y'. The two input ports, 'x' and 'y', each consist of 2-bit binary numbers which are processed to yield the 4-bit binary product 'prod'. The output port 'prod' collates intermediate results to form the final binary product of 'x' and 'y'. Internally, the module defines three intermediate sum signals 's[2:0]' and two carry signals 'c[2:1]'. 's[0]' directly stores the bit-wise AND operation result of the least significant bits of 'x' and 'y'. The signal 's[1]', coupled with the carry 'c[1]', is generated by summing the products of bits across 'x' and 'y', reflecting partial products. The most significant parts of the output, represented by 's[2]' and 'c[2]', are computed by adding the carry 'c[1]' to the direct product of the most significant bits of 'x' and 'y'. The module's code is organized into assignments that calculate these intermediate sums and carries, which are then concatenated to form the final product. This module encapsulates hardware-level multiplication logic for 2-bit numbers using simple bitwise operations and addition, emphasizing efficient and compact computational logic typical in digital circuits.
