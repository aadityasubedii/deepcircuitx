    "module": "The vdcmul_2b module multiplies two 2-bit binary numbers, 'x' and 'y', outputting a 4-bit product 'prod'. This operation is achieved through a series of bitwise AND operations and additions, using internal sum ('s') and carry ('c') signals to compute intermediate results and carryovers, systematically constructing the product's bits from least to most significant."
