    "spec": "Module name: rca32b. Module specification: The 'rca32b' module is a 32-bit ripple carry adder designed to compute the sum of two 32-bit binary numbers 'a' and 'b', while considering an additional carry bit input 'cin'. It outputs a 32-bit sum through the output port 'sum' and a carry-out bit through the output port 'cout'. The module includes two input ports [a, b] which receive the 32-bit binary numbers and an input port [cin] for the carry-in bit. The outputs are declared as [sum] which is the 32-bit result of the addition, and [cout] which indicates the final carry-out from the addition. Internally, the module utilizes a wire 'cin4'. This internal signal serves as the intermediary carry-out from the first 16-bit segment addition, and as the carry-in for the second 16-bit segment addition, ensuring correct calculation across the full 32 bits. The code integrates two instances of a 16-bit ripple carry adder ('rca16b') for each segment of the inputs: 'rc161' processes the lower 16 bits and 'rc162' processes the upper 16 bits, with the connectivity between them mediated by 'cin4'.",
