Module name: rca_4b. Module specification: The 'rca_4b' is a 4-bit ripple carry adder designed in Verilog that efficiently adds two 4-bit binary numbers 'a' and 'b', along with an input carry 'cin'. It outputs a 4-bit sum 'sum' and a carry-out 'cout'. The module encompasses input ports [a, b, cin] where 'a' and 'b' are the 4-bit operands, and 'cin' is the initial carry affecting the LSB addition. The output ports [sum, cout] includes 'sum' as the 4-bit result of the addition and 'cout' for the overflow bit, crucial for cascading into larger bit-size adders. Internally, the module uses a 3-bit wide wire 'c', serving as intermediate carries between the stages of bit-wise addition. The code is structured with four instances of a submodule 'rca_1b', which handles the addition for each bit: 'r1' for the least significant bit up to 'r4' for the most significant bit. Each 'rca_1b' submodule performs bit-wise binary addition and utilizes internal wire assignments to link carry outputs to the subsequent carry inputs, thereby creating the ripple carry effect essential for the adderâ€™s operation. This meticulous organization ensures each bit and carry is processed correctly, reflecting a hierarchical and modular design in digital adders.
