    "spec": "Module name: rca_4b. Module specification: The 'rca_4b' is a 4-bit ripple carry adder designed in Verilog that efficiently adds two 4-bit binary numbers 'a' and 'b', along with an input carry 'cin'. It outputs a 4-bit sum 'sum' and a carry-out 'cout'. The module encompasses input ports [a, b, cin] where 'a' and 'b' are the 4-bit operands, and 'cin' is the initial carry affecting the LSB addition. The output ports [sum, cout] includes 'sum' as the 4-bit result of the addition and 'cout' for the overflow bit, crucial for cascading into larger bit-size adders. Internally, the module uses a 3-bit wide wire 'c', serving as intermediate carries between the stages of bit-wise addition. The code is structured with four instances of a submodule 'rca_1b', which handles the addition for each bit: 'r1' for the least significant bit up to 'r4' for the most significant bit. Each 'rca_1b' submodule performs bit-wise binary addition and utilizes internal wire assignments to link carry outputs to the subsequent carry inputs, thereby creating the ripple carry effect essential for the adder\u2019s operation. This meticulous organization ensures each bit and carry is processed correctly, reflecting a hierarchical and modular design in digital adders.",
