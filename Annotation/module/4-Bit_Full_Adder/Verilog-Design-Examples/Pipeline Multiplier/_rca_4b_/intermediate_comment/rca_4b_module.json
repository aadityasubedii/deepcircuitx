    "module": "The 'rca_4b' module performs 4-bit binary addition of two numbers 'a' and 'b' with an input carry 'cin', outputting a sum 'sum' and a carry-out 'cout'. It leverages four instances of the 'rca_1b' submodule, each handling one bit of the addition, with internal carry propagation facilitated by wire 'c', illustrating a modular design approach that materializes the ripple carry effect inherent to adders."
