The 'rca16b' module implements a 16-bit ripple carry adder using two 8-bit ripple carry adders ('rca8b'). It accepts two 16-bit numbers ('a' and 'b') and an input carry ('cin'), producing a 16-bit sum ('sum') and a carry out ('cout'). The lower 8 bits of 'a' and 'b' are processed first by 'rc81', generating partial sum and an intermediate carry ('cin4'), which is used by 'rc82' to add the higher 8 bits and produce the remaining sum and final carry out. This modular approach ensures efficient and correct addition across the 16-bit inputs.
