    "spec": "Module name: rca16b. \nModule specification: The 'rca16b' is a Verilog module designed as a 16-bit ripple carry adder, utilizing two instances of an 8-bit ripple carry adder ('rca8b'). The module adds together two 16-bit numbers ('a' and 'b') with an input carry ('cin'), producing a 16-bit summed output ('sum') and an output carry ('cout'). The inputs 'a' and 'b' are 16-bit wide buses, with 'cin' as a single-bit input carry. The output 'sum' is also a 16-bit wide bus that captures the result of the addition, and 'cout' is a single-bit output that serves as the carry out of the entire 16-bit addition. Internally, the module employs a wire 'cin4' which transfers the carry output from the lower 8 bits processed by the first adder instance ('rc81') to the second adder instance ('rc82') that handles the upper 8 bits of 'a' and 'b'. The `rca8b` instances are connected such that 'rc81' processes the lower 8-bits of each input using the initial carry ('cin') and outputs intermediate results to 'cin4' and 'sum[7:0]', while 'rc82' then processes the higher 8-bits, taking 'cin4' as its input carry and producing the final 'sum[15:8]' and 'cout'. This sequential processing of the two halves via internal carry propagation ensures correct overall computation of the sum and carry-out, leveraging the modular structure to maintain clarity and efficiency in the design.",
