The vdcmul_4b module performs a 4-bit multiplication using decomposed 2-bit multiplications and 4-bit additions. It takes two 4-bit inputs 'x' and 'y' and outputs an 8-bit product 'prod'. The multiplication is carried out by first generating four partial products using 'vdcmul_2b' instances, which are then progressively added together using 'rca_4b' (ripple carry adder) modules and a 'half_adder' to compile the final result in 'prod'.
