    "spec": "Module name: vdcmul_4b. \nModule specification: The vdcmul_4b is a 4-bit multiplier module that utilizes 2-bit multipliers (vdcmul_2b) and 4-bit ripple carry adders (rca_4b) to compute the product of two 4-bit binary numbers. The inputs to this module are 'x' and 'y', both 4-bit binary numbers, and the output is 'prod', an 8-bit binary number representing the product of 'x' and 'y'. Internally, the module generates partial products using four instances of vdcmul_2b: 'pp1' from the lower bits of both 'x' and 'y', 'pp2' and 'pp3' from cross segments of 'x' and 'y', and 'pp4' from the upper bits of both 'x' and 'y'. These partial products are then added using three 4-bit ripple carry adders (rca_4b) and a half adder, creating intermediate sums and carries ('sum1', 'sum2', 'sum3', 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 's1', and 'ca1'). The half adder adds the carries from the first two adders. The final product 'prod' is constructed by assembling 'sum3', 'sum2', 'pp1', and handling bits appropriately to reflect the complete 8-bit multiplication result. The design efficiently breaks down the complex multiplication operation into manageable small bit operations, leveraging the hardware modularity and smaller arithmetic components.",

Explanation: \n- **pp1, pp2, pp3, pp4**: These are the partial products obtained from each 2-bit multiplication operation performed by instances of the 'vdcmul_2b' module. 'pp1' results from multiplying the lower 2 bits of 'x' and 'y', 'pp2' from the lower 2 bits of 'x' and the upper 2 bits of 'y', 'pp3' from the upper 2 bits of 'x' and the lower 2 bits of 'y', and 'pp4' from the upper 2 bits of both 'x' and 'y'.\n- **c1, c2, c3**: These are carry outputs from the 4-bit ripple carry adders ('rca_4b'). 'c1' is the carry output from the first adder combining 'pp2' and 'pp3', 'c2' from the second adder handling the sum of 'sum1' and the upper bits of 'pp1', and 'c3' from the third adder combining 'pp4' with computed values 'ca1', 's1', and upper bits of 'sum2'.\n- **s1, ca1**: 's1' is the sum output and 'ca1' is the carry output from the 'half_adder', which adds the carry outputs 'c1' and 'c2'.\n- **sum1, sum2, sum3**: These are intermediate sum results of the 4-bit addition operations performed by 'rca_4b' instances. 'sum1' is the result of adding 'pp2' and 'pp3', 'sum2' from adding 'sum1' and the modified 'pp1', and 'sum3' from adding 'pp4' and the adjusted outputs of the half-adder along with the upper bits of 'sum2'."
