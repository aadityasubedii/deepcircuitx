The 'rca64' module performs a 64-bit addition of two numbers 'a' and 'b' with an input carry 'cin', outputting the sum and a carry-out 'cout'. It achieves this through two 'rca32b' instances, where the first adds the lower 32 bits and provides an intermediate carry 'cin4', which is then used by the second instance to add the upper 32 bits, thus ensuring continuous carry propagation and correct result across the full 64 bits.
