    "spec": "Module name: rca64. \nModule specification: The 'rca64' module is specifically designed to execute a 64-bit addition operation for two input numbers 'a' and 'b', utilizing an input carry 'cin'. It outputs the 64-bit sum along with a carry-out. The inputs include 'a' and 'b', both 64-bit operands, and 'cin', a single-bit carry-in. The outputs consist of 'sum', a 64-bit result of the addition, and 'cout', a single-bit output carry. Inside the module, a significant internal signal named 'cin4' acts as a carry-out from the first half of the operation and serves as a carry-in for the second half. This ensures proper carry propagation between the concatenated 32-bit adder modules. The implementation strategically pairs two instances of the 'rca32b' module: the first module 'rc321' adds the lower 32 bits of 'a' and 'b' taking 'cin' as input and produces a partial sum along with an intermediate carry 'cin4'. The second module 'rc322' then processes the upper 32 bits using 'cin4' as the carry-in, and outputs the final 32 bits of the sum and the final carry-out 'cout'.",
