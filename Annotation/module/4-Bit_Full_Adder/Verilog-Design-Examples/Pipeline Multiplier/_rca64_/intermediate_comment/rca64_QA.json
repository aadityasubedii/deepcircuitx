It achieves this by instantiating two smaller modules named 'rca32b', each responsible for adding 32-bits of the inputs. The first instance of 'rca32b' adds the lower 32 bits of 'a' and 'b', and outputs a carry which is then used as an input carry for the second 'rca32b' instance which adds the upper 32 bits of 'a' and 'b'. The result is a 64-bit sum across 'sum[63:0]' and an output carry 'cout', effectively forming a 64-bit ripple carry adder."
