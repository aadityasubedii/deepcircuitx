    "module": "The rca8b module is an 8-bit ripple carry adder that calculates the sum of two 8-bit inputs along with an incoming carry. It leverages two 4-bit ripple carry adders, rc41 and rc42, to process lower and upper bits respectively, using an intermediate carry to link their calculations and produce both the sum and the final carry output. This design effectively demonstrates modular decomposition to simplify the addition process."
