Module name: rca8b. Module specification: The `rca8b` module is an 8-bit ripple carry adder, composed to perform the addition of two 8-bit binary numbers `a` and `b`, incorporating an additional incoming carry bit `cin`. It produces a resulting 8-bit sum `sum` and a carry output `cout`. The input ports include `[7:0]a` and `[7:0]b`, which are the two 8-bit binary numbers to be added, and `cin`, a carry input that may originate from a preceding calculation. The output ports are `[7:0]sum`, housing the binary result of the addition, and `cout`, the carry output that results from the addition of the most significant bits. Internally, the module uses a signal `cin4` acting as the carry connector between two instances of the `rca_4b` module. The first instance, `rc41`, processes the lower four bits of `a` and `b` along with `cin`, producing part of the sum and an intermediate carry `cin4`. The second instance, `rc42`, takes the upper four bits of `a` and `b`, and utilizes `cin4` to complete the calculation of the upper part of `sum` and the final carry output `cout`. This division into two 4-bit operations demonstrates an efficient hierarchical approach in the digital adder design.
