The rca_4b1 module implements a 4-bit ripple carry adder that sums two 4-bit numbers (a and b) with an input carry (cin), producing a 4-bit sum (sum) and an output carry (cout). It employs four instances of the rca_1b sub-module, each handling 1-bit addition, with carry propagation between stages through internal signals, facilitating sequential addition from least to most significant bits.
