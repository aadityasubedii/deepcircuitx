Module name: rca_4b1.

Module specification: The `rca_4b1` is a module in Verilog that functions as a 4-bit ripple carry adder. It adds two 4-bit numbers, `a` and `b`, and considers an additional input carry, `cin`, efficiently producing a 4-bit sum, `sum`, and an output carry, `cout`. The inputs include `a` and `b` both as 4-bit signals representing the numbers to be added, and `cin` as a single-bit signal serving as the initial carry-in for the least significant bit addition. The outputs are `sum`, a 4-bit signal representing the total sum, and `cout`, a single-bit carry-out, useful for cascading multiple adder stages. Internally, the module uses a 3-bit wire `c` to pass the carry-out from one bit's addition to the carry-in of the next. This module comprises four instances of another module, `rca_1b`, each responsible for performing the addition of corresponding bits from `a` and `b`, along with the propagated carry. The `rca_1b` module, which handles the logic for each bit's addition, uses basic digital logic operations to compute the sum and carry out. The outputs of each `rca_1b` instance provide the individual bits of the `sum` and the carry between the stages, culminating in the `cout` from the addition of the most significant bits. This structural design facilitates the characteristic ripple effect of carry propagation across the bit stages, embodying the ripple carry adder's operation.
