It generates a 4-bit sum (`sum`) and an output carry (`cout`). It is built using four instances of the `rca_1b` module. Each `rca_1b` sub-module performs 1-bit addition, taking two 1-bit numbers along with a carry-in bit, and producing a 1-bit sum and carry-out bit. The carry from each bit addition is chained into the next, hence \"ripple carry\". The operations inside the `rca_1b` module are based on basic binary addition logic, where the sum is determined by the XOR operation among the input bits, and the carry-out is determined by whether any two of the three input bits are high using AND and OR operations."
