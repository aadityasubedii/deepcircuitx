The 'vdcmul_32b' module multiplies two 32-bit numbers to produce a 64-bit product. It decomposes 32-bit inputs into 16-bit segments, multiplies them using `vdcmul_16b` modules to generate partial products, and then combines these using 32-bit ripple carry adders (`rca32b`) and a half adder, carefully managing carries to construct the final product accurately. The outputs are aligned and concatenated to form the 64-bit output.
