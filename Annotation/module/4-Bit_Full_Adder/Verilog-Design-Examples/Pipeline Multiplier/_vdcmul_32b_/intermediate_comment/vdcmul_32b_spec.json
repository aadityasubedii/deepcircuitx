    "spec": "Module name: vdcmul_32b. Module specification: The 'vdcmul_32b' is a Verilog module designed to multiply two 32-bit binary numbers, x and y, resulting in a 64-bit product. It utilizes input ports `x` and `y`, both of 32-bit width, representing the multiplicand and multiplier respectively. The output port, `prod`, is a 64-bit signal that delivers the resulting product of the multiplication. Internally, the module generates and manipulates several signals: 32-bit partial products `pp1`, `pp2`, `pp3`, `pp4` obtained from four instances of a 16-bit multiplier (`vdcmul_16b`); carries `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and half adder outputs `s1`, `ca1` from ripple carry adders (`rca32b`) and a half adder; and sums `sum1`, `sum2`, `sum3` also generated by the ripple carry adders, used to progressively build the final product. The multiplication process decomposes into steps where each 16-bit segment of `x` and `y` are first multiplied to form partial products. These are combined and aligned using 32-bit adders and a half adder, orchestrating carries and sums to form the final 64-bit product. The product is constructed by concatenating specific segments of `sum3`, `sum2` and `pp1`, aligned to correctly represent the 64-bit multiplication result.",

The multiplication is implemented using smaller units of 16-bit multipliers (`vdcmul_16b`), which separately compute partial products (pp1, pp2, pp3, pp4) for different combinations of 16-bit segments of the inputs. These partial products are then combined using 32-bit ripple carry adders (`rca32b`) and a half adder to correctly align and add these values, considering the carries generated at each stage, to produce the final 64-bit product. The product is composed by concatenating the results of the additions and aligning them appropriately to form the correct binary representation of the product."
