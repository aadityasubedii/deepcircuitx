The multiplication is implemented using smaller units of 16-bit multipliers (`vdcmul_16b`), which separately compute partial products (pp1, pp2, pp3, pp4) for different combinations of 16-bit segments of the inputs. These partial products are then combined using 32-bit ripple carry adders (`rca32b`) and a half adder to correctly align and add these values, considering the carries generated at each stage, to produce the final 64-bit product. The product is composed by concatenating the results of the additions and aligning them appropriately to form the correct binary representation of the product."
