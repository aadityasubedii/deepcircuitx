    "module": "The vdcmul_8b module executes an 8-bit by 8-bit multiplication, outputting a 16-bit product. It computes this by dividing inputs into 4-bit segments, multiplying these using four vdcmul_4b units, and summing the results through three rca8b adders and a half-adder, structuring intermediate sums and carries to produce the final output."
