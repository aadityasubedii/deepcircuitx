Module name: vdcmul_8b. 
Module specification: The 'vdcmul_8b' module is designed to perform an 8-bit by 8-bit multiplication, yielding a 16-bit product. Input ports 'x' and 'y' are the two 8-bit numbers that are to be multiplied, and the output port 'prod' is a 16-bit signal representing their product. Internally, the module utilizes four instances of a 4-bit multiplier ('vdcmul_4b') to generate four 8-bit partial product signals (pp1 through pp4). The ripple carry adders ('rca8b') and a half-adder help in summing these partial products. Intermediate sums, sum1, sum2, and sum3, along with carry signals c1, c2, c3, s1, and ca1, carefully manage the bit additions and carry forwards. The final output 'prod' is composed by concatenating the outputs of the last addition and specific partial products. This detailed arrangement allows for a methodical multiplication performed through segmented products and their strategic addition, encapsulating the functionality of multi-bit multiplication within a larger arithmetic context.
