Module name: pipeline_tb. Module specification: The 'pipeline_tb' module is a testbench designed to verify the operation of a pipeline module named 'dut', specifically focusing on the multiplication of two 64-bit numbers. The inputs to this module include two 64-bit registers, 'x' and 'y', which serve as the multiplicands in the multiplication operation, a clock signal 'clk' that orchestrates timing and synchronization, and a 'reset' signal used for initializing the state at the start of the simulation. The output of the module is a 128-bit signal 'prod', which captures the resulting product from the pipeline module. Internally, the 'clk' signal oscillates every 5 units of time, ensuring consistent timing for operations, while the 'reset' signal initially sets high and is brought low after 10 units to begin normal activity. The testbench employs several initial blocks; the first manages the state of the clock signal, the second sets the initial state via the reset signal, and the third block is used for assigning test values to 'x' and 'y', monitoring the edge of the clock, and displaying both the calculated and actual products for comparison. This comprehensive setup in 'pipeline_tb' ensures that the functionality of the multiplication within the pipeline module is thoroughly tested under controlled conditions.
