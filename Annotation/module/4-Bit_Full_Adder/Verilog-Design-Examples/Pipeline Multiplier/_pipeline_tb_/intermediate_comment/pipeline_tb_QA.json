It verifies the multiplication of two 64-bit numbers (x and y) being processed by the pipeline and compares the calculated product with the actual product of the two numbers. The testbench operates with a clock signal 'clk', which toggles every 5 units of time, and a reset signal 'reset', which initializes at the beginning of the simulation. The testbench displays the inputs x and y along with the expected and actual products for diagnostic checking, thus ensuring that the pipeline module operates correctly under these test conditions."

It oscillates between 0 and 1 every 5 units of time.\n- **reset**: This internal signal serves to initialize or reset the internal state of the pipeline module at the beginning of the simulation.
