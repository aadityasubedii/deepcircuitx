Module name: pipeline. Module specification: The 'pipeline' module is designed to perform a 128-bit multiplication operation on two 64-bit inputs, `x` and `y`. It effectively decomposes the multiplication into smaller chunks managed by a series of pipeline stages, leveraging multiple instances of a 32-bit multiplier (`vdcmul_32b`) and a combination of ripple carry adders (`rca64`) and a half-adder. Inputs include two 64-bit operands `x` and `y`, a clock signal `clk` for synchronization, and a `reset` signal for initializing internal states. The sole output `prod` is a 128-bit value representing the product of the inputs. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `pp1` to `pp4` for partial products from the multipliers, `temp1` to `temp4` and `temps1` to `temps3` for storing intermediate results, and summarizing carries (`tempc1` to `tempc3`, `has`, `haca`) and sums (`sum1` to `sum3`). The first section of the code initializes `xtemp` and `ytemp` on reset. The next several sections instantiate 32-bit multipliers for generating partial products and implement ripple carry adders and a half-adder for progressing and combining results. Each result is stored and transferred across stages with registers, optimizing for throughput in a pipelined architecture. The final output `prod` is configured by concatenating various intermediate sums and partial products, precisely structured to form the correct 128-bit product output.
