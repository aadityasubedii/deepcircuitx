The module internally uses instances of 8-bit multipliers and 16-bit Ripple Carry Adders (RCAs) along with a half adder, to compute the product using a multiplication algorithm that separates the input operands into higher and lower bits, processes them, and recombines the results appropriately to generate the final product."

These sums are part of the process to yield the final 32-bit product."
