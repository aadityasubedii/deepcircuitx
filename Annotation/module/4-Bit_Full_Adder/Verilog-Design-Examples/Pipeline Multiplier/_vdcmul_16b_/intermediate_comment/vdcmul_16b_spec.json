    "spec": "Module name: vdcmul_16b. \nModule specification: The vdcmul_16b is a Verilog module designed to perform a 16-bit by 16-bit binary multiplication, producing a 32-bit output product. It accepts two input ports, `x` and `y`, both of which are 16-bit numbers meant to be multiplied. These inputs are systematically broken down and processed to create a single 32-bit output through the output port `prod`. The module utilizes internal signals such as `pp1` to `pp4` for storing the partial products computed by separate instances of 8-bit multipliers, `sum1` to `sum3` for holding intermediate sums calculated using 16-bit Ripple Carry Adders (RCAs), and `c1` to `c3`, `s1`, and `ca1` for managing the carries during the summation processes. Specifically, `c1` to `c3` are carry outputs from the RCAs, `s1` and `ca1` are outputs from a half-adder that manages the sum of carry outputs `c1` and `c2`. The module architecture features four instances of an 8-bit multiplier (`vdcmul_8b`) for generating the partial products. These products are then added together using three instances of the 16-bit RCA (`rca16b`) and a half-adder (`half_adder`) to ensure the carry bits are managed appropriately. The final product `prod` is assembled by combining `sum3`, the low 8 bits of `sum2`, and the lowest 8 bits of `pp1` into a 32-bit word. This structured and systematic approach to multiplication simplifies the complex process of binary multiplication into manageable components, leveraging modular code and internal hierarchy.",

The module internally uses instances of 8-bit multipliers and 16-bit Ripple Carry Adders (RCAs) along with a half adder, to compute the product using a multiplication algorithm that separates the input operands into higher and lower bits, processes them, and recombines the results appropriately to generate the final product."

Specifically, `pp1` stores the product of the lower 8 bits of `x` and `y`, `pp2` the lower 8 bits of `x` with the higher 8 bits of `y`, `pp3` the higher 8 bits of `x` with the lower 8 bits of `y`, and `pp4` the higher 8 bits of both `x` and `y`.\n- **c1, c2, c3**: These carry wires are output from the 16-bit Ripple Carry Adders (RCAs) and used to manage the carry operations during the addition of the partial products.\n- **s1, ca1**: `s1` and `ca1` are outputs from the half adder used to add `c1` and `c2` together. `s1` indicates the sum, and `ca1` indicates the carry generated from this addition.\n- **sum1, sum2, sum3**: These 16-bit wires store intermediate sum results. `sum1` stores the result from adding `pp2` and `pp3`, `sum2` from adding `sum1` and higher bits of `pp1` shifted accordingly, and `sum3` is the final summation incorporating `pp4`, the result from the half adder (`ca1, s1`), and the most significant bits of `sum2`.
