    "module": "The vdcmul_16b module performs 16-bit by 16-bit multiplication to output a 32-bit product. It processes the inputs through four 8-bit multipliers for partial products and uses three 16-bit Ripple Carry Adders and a half-adder for summing and carry management, assembling the final product from computed sums and partial products efficiently."
