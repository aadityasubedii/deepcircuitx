Module name: vdcmul_16b. 
Module specification: The vdcmul_16b is a Verilog module designed to perform a 16-bit by 16-bit binary multiplication, producing a 32-bit output product. It accepts two input ports, `x` and `y`, both of which are 16-bit numbers meant to be multiplied. These inputs are systematically broken down and processed to create a single 32-bit output through the output port `prod`. The module utilizes internal signals such as `pp1` to `pp4` for storing the partial products computed by separate instances of 8-bit multipliers, `sum1` to `sum3` for holding intermediate sums calculated using 16-bit Ripple Carry Adders (RCAs), and `c1` to `c3`, `s1`, and `ca1` for managing the carries during the summation processes. Specifically, `c1` to `c3` are carry outputs from the RCAs, `s1` and `ca1` are outputs from a half-adder that manages the sum of carry outputs `c1` and `c2`. The module architecture features four instances of an 8-bit multiplier (`vdcmul_8b`) for generating the partial products. These products are then added together using three instances of the 16-bit RCA (`rca16b`) and a half-adder (`half_adder`) to ensure the carry bits are managed appropriately. The final product `prod` is assembled by combining `sum3`, the low 8 bits of `sum2`, and the lowest 8 bits of `pp1` into a 32-bit word. This structured and systematic approach to multiplication simplifies the complex process of binary multiplication into manageable components, leveraging modular code and internal hierarchy.
