    "module": "The half_adder module performs single-bit binary addition, outputting both sum and carry. It calculates 'sum' using XOR (a^b) to reflect the bit sum excluding carry, and 'carry' using AND (a&b) to indicate overflow if both bits are 1. This direct implementation utilizes input operands 'a' and 'b' straightforwardly without internal signals, ensuring simplicity and clarity in binary arithmetic operations."
