It outputs the 'sum' and the 'carry' of this operation. The 'sum' represents the least significant bit of the addition, calculated using the XOR operation (a^b), which yields 1 if exactly one of the bits is 1. The 'carry' is the most significant bit, indicating an overflow in addition, calculated using the AND operation (a&b), which is 1 if both bits are 1."
