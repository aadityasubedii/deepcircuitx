Module name: half_adder. Module specification: The half_adder is a digital logic module designed to compute the sum and carry of two single-bit binary values. Its primary functionality includes adding the inputs 'a' and 'b' to produce a 'sum' and a 'carry'. Specifically, the 'sum' output represents the XOR result of inputs 'a' and 'b', providing the binary addition result excluding the carry. Conversely, the 'carry' output is the result of the AND operation on the same inputs, indicating an overflow bit carried out from the most significant bit of the addition. The module has two input ports, 'a' and 'b', both single-bit, which act as the operands for the addition process. Two output ports, 'sum' and 'carry', correspondingly, exhibit the results of the XOR and AND operations. There are no internal signals used in this module; it directly computes outputs 'sum' and 'carry' through assignment statements. Overall, the half_adder module is essential for constructing more complex multi-bit adders by handling the fundamental binary addition of single bits.
