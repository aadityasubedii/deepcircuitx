It breaks down the 64-bit multiplication into smaller 32-bit multiplications using the sub-module `vdcmul_32b` for efficiency. The results of these multiplications are then added using a series of Ripple Carry Adders (`rca64`) and a half adder to form the final 128-bit product. The process involves handling partial products and carry outputs, ensuring accurate addition towards forming the resultant product. This type of architecture leverages smaller multipliers and adders to manage larger bit-width multiplications commonly used in digital arithmetic operations."

It serves as the destination for the final product resulting from the multiplication of inputs `x` and `y`. Given the 64-bit nature of both inputs, the product can occupy up to 128 bits, hence the width of this port.
