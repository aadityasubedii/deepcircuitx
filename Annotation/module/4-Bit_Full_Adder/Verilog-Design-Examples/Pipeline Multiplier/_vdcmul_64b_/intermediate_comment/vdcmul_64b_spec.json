    "spec": "Module name: vdcmul_64b. Module specification: The `vdcmul_64b` module is constructed to compute the 128-bit product (`prod`) of two 64-bit operands, `x` and `y`. The input ports are `x` and `y`, each being 64-bit wide serving as the main operands for the multiplication task. The output port, `prod`, is a 128-bit wide signal that provides the multiplication result. The module uses several internal signals including `pp1`, `pp2`, `pp3`, `pp4` (which are 64-bit partial products generated by breaking down the 64-bit inputs into 32-bit segments and multiplying them), carrying signals `c1`, `c2`, `c3` (output carries from Ripple Carry Adders indicating overflow bits), `s1` and `ca1` (output and carry from a half adder), and intermediate sums `sum1`, `sum2`, `sum3` (64-bit sums at different stages of the addition process). The design includes four instances of the `vdcmul_32b` sub-module for generating the partial products, three `rca64` modules for consecutive addition operations, and a `half_adder` for handling the carries. The cumulative functionality encapsulates splitting, multiplying in parts, and adding the segmented results efficiently to yield the final product, symbolizing a structured approach to complex multiplication tasks in digital systems.",

It breaks down the 64-bit multiplication into smaller 32-bit multiplications using the sub-module `vdcmul_32b` for efficiency. The results of these multiplications are then added using a series of Ripple Carry Adders (`rca64`) and a half adder to form the final 128-bit product. The process involves handling partial products and carry outputs, ensuring accurate addition towards forming the resultant product. This type of architecture leverages smaller multipliers and adders to manage larger bit-width multiplications commonly used in digital arithmetic operations."
