Module name: vdcmul_64b. Module specification: The `vdcmul_64b` module is constructed to compute the 128-bit product (`prod`) of two 64-bit operands, `x` and `y`. The input ports are `x` and `y`, each being 64-bit wide serving as the main operands for the multiplication task. The output port, `prod`, is a 128-bit wide signal that provides the multiplication result. The module uses several internal signals including `pp1`, `pp2`, `pp3`, `pp4` (which are 64-bit partial products generated by breaking down the 64-bit inputs into 32-bit segments and multiplying them), carrying signals `c1`, `c2`, `c3` (output carries from Ripple Carry Adders indicating overflow bits), `s1` and `ca1` (output and carry from a half adder), and intermediate sums `sum1`, `sum2`, `sum3` (64-bit sums at different stages of the addition process). The design includes four instances of the `vdcmul_32b` sub-module for generating the partial products, three `rca64` modules for consecutive addition operations, and a `half_adder` for handling the carries. The cumulative functionality encapsulates splitting, multiplying in parts, and adding the segmented results efficiently to yield the final product, symbolizing a structured approach to complex multiplication tasks in digital systems.
