The `vdcmul_64b` module performs 128-bit multiplication of two 64-bit numbers, `x` and `y`, outputting the product `prod`. This is achieved through decomposing the 64-bit inputs into 32-bit segments, multiplying these segments using `vdcmul_32b` sub-modules, and combining the results with Ripple Carry Adders (`rca64`) and a half adder to accurately assemble the final product, ensuring correct handling of carries and partial sums.
