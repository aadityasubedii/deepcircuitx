Module name: moore_nonol_tb. Module specification: The "moore_nonol_tb" is a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of a Moore state machine that detects a specific binary sequence "1101". The module features three input ports: 'in' for binary inputs that drive state transitions, 'clk' as a clock signal for sequential logic, and 'reset' to initialize the state machine to its starting state (S0). The output port 'out' indicates whether a "1101" sequence has been detected by outputting a '1'. Internal signals include 'new_out', a register to store expected outputs for validation, 'ps' which holds the current state of the machine, and 'ns', which indicates the next state based on current input and state. The code encompasses several blocks: initialization of clock and reset signals; a simulation loop with a random stimulus generation and output validation, where it reports test pass or fail based on the output comparison to 'new_out'; sequential logic to transition states on clock edges or reset; and combinational logic defining state transitions and output behavior based on the current state and input conditions. This structured design allows for systematic testing and debugging of the Moore machine's sequence detection capabilities.
