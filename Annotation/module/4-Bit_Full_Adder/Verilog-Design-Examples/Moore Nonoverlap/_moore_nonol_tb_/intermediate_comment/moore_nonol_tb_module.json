    "module": "The moore_nonol_tb module simulates a Moore state machine tasked with detecting the binary sequence \"1101\". It uses input, clock, and reset ports to control state transitions and validate output behavior, deploying internal signals for state management and expected outcome analysis. The module's structured blocks initialize signals, generate stimuli, manage state transitions on clock edges, and provide feedback on test results through comparisons between actual and expected outputs, ensuring comprehensive functional verification of the sequence detection mechanism."
