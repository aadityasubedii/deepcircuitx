Module name: moore_nonol. 
Module specification: The `moore_nonol` Verilog module implements a finite state machine (FSM) based on the Moore model, where the output is dependent solely on the current state. It has three input ports: `in`, `clk`, and `reset`. `in` affects the state transitions, `clk` synchronizes state transitions to the rising edge of the clock, and `reset` asynchronously resets the FSM to the initial state, S0. The single output port, `out`, reflects the current state, typically being `0` except when in state S4, where it is `1`. Internally, the module utilizes two crucial signals: `present_state` and `next_state`. `present_state` holds the current state, updated either on the positive clock edge or reset. `next_state` anticipates the FSM's next state given the current conditions. The module primarily consists of two procedural blocks. The first block, sensitive to the clock and reset signals, handles the state updates from `next_state` to `present_state`. The second always block, sensitive to `present_state` and the `in` signal, manages the state transitions and output decisions based on the current state and input conditions. However, this second block seems to contain naming inconsistencies (`ps`, `ns`, `new_out` should respectively be `present_state`, `next_state`, `out`) that need correction for proper functionality.
