    "module": "The `moore_nonol` module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) that transitions through states based on the input signal `in` and produces an output `out` determined by its current state. The module uses two procedural blocks: one sensitive to `clk` and `reset` for updating the state from `next_state`, and another sensitive to `present_state` and `in`, to determine state transitions and output values, where the output is generally `0` except in state S4, where it is `1`. Asynchronous reset sets the FSM to the initial state S0."
