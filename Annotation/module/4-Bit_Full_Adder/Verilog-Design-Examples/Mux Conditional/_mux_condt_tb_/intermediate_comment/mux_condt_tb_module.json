    "module": "The `mux_condt_tb` module tests a multiplexer (`mux_case`) by simulating input conditions and verifying output selection correctness. It uses input ports `in0` to `in3` for potential data inputs, a `select` signal to determine the active input, and an `out` wire for multiplexer outputs. Internally, `new_out` holds expected results, validated against `out` in 100 iterative tests driven by randomized `select` values, processed through tasks and conditional checks to ensure functional accuracy in the testbench."
