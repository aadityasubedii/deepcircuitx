Module name: mux_condt_tb. 
Module specification: The `mux_condt_tb` module is a testbench designed to evaluate the functionality of a multiplexer `mux_case`, simulating the selection process and validating the multiplexer's behavior under assorted input conditions. It includes input ports `in0`, `in1`, `in2`, `in3`, all of which are 2-bit registers representing various data possibilities for the multiplexer's inputs, and a 2-bit register `select` used to select among these inputs. The output port `out` is a 2-bit wire that conveys the multiplexer's selected output. An internal signal `new_out`, also a 2-bit register, holds the expected result for comparison against `out` to determine whether the multiplexer outputs correctly according to the selected input. The module comprises different functional blocks, including instantiation of `mux_case`, initialization of inputs, and the stimulus task that applies random `select` values and sets `new_out` accordingly through a case statement. The test is further conducted over 100 iterations with assertions checking the correctness of the multiplexer's output against `new_out`, accompanied by corresponding pass or fail messages displayed iteratively for each test.
