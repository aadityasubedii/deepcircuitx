The 'mux_condt' module is a 2-bit 4-to-1 multiplexer that selects one of four input signals based on a 2-bit selector and routes the selected input to the output. It employs a nested ternary operator within a single continuous assignment to implement the selection logic, determining the output based on the state of the selector bits, thereby mapping the inputs directly to the output without the need for additional internal signals.
