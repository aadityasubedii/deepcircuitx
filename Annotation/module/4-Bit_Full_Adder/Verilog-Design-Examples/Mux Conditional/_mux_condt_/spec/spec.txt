Module name: mux_condt. Module specification: The 'mux_condt' is a 2-bit, 4-to-1 multiplexer designed using Verilog. Its primary function is to select one of four 2-bit inputs (in0, in1, in2, in3) based on a 2-bit control signal 'select', and route it to a 2-bit output 'out'. The inputs 'in0', 'in1', 'in2', and 'in3' are the 2-bit data inputs among which one is selectively outputted, whereas 'select' is a control input that dictates this selection. The selection uses the upper bit 'select[1]' to determine the pair (either (in0, in1) or (in2, in3)), and the lower bit 'select[0]' to pick one from the chosen pair. The Verilog code uses a single continuous assignment with a nested ternary operator for the output 'out', which directly maps these selection operations without the utilization of explicit additional internal signals. This structure ensures a compact and efficient implementation of the multiplexer's functionality.
