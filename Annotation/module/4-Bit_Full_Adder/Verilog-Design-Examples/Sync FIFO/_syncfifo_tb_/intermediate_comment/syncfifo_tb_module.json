    "module": "The `syncfifo_tb` module tests the functionality of a synchronous FIFO buffer by simulating write and read operations, as well as handling reset, full, and empty conditions. It includes clock generation, the initialization of control signals (reset, write_en, read_en) and data input, along with tasks for sequential read and write operations to stress test the FIFO under various simulated scenarios, ensuring robust operation and validating behavior as specified."
