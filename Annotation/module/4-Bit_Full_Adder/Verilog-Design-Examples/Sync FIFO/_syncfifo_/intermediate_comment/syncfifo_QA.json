It handles data storage and retrieval while managing the read and write pointers, and it checks for full and empty conditions. The module takes input data, manages the storage in an 8-byte memory vector, and outputs data based on the control signals. It responds to write requests with a write enable and valid conditions, and similarly, it responds to read requests under read enable and valid conditions. The FIFO uses separate pointers for reading and writing activities to ensure synchronized data handling without data corruption. The module also handles reset conditions to clear its pointers and count."

It becomes high when the storage count equals the maximum storage capacity (8 in this case).\n- empty: Signal that indicates whether the FIFO is empty.
