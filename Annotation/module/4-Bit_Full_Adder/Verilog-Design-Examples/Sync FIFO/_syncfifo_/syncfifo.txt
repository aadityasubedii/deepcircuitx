The 'syncfifo' module implements a synchronous FIFO buffer handling data storage and retrieval, managing full and empty states via write and read operations synchronized to a clock. It features separate pointers for reading and writing, adjusting an internal count during these operations, enabling robust data flow management. Internal vector 'memory_vec' stores actual data, and control logic for pointer and count operations ensures data integrity across resets and varying fill states.
