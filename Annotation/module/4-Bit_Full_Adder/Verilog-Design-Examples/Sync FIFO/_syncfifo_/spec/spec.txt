Module name: syncfifo. 
Module specification: The 'syncfifo' module is designed as a synchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer memory with the primary functionality of storing and retrieving data, managing pointers, and checking full and empty conditions. This module includes input ports such as 'clk' (clock signal to synchronize operations), 'reset' (active-low signal to reset pointers and counts), 'write_en' (write enable signal to allow data writing when the FIFO is not full), 'read_en' (read enable signal to allow reading from FIFO if not empty), and 'data_in' (8-bit input data for write operations). The output ports include 'full' (indicating FIFO is full), 'empty' (indicating FIFO is empty), and 'out' (8-bit output data from FIFO).

Internal signals comprise 'memory_vec' (an 8-element, 8-bit wide vector serving as storage), 'write_pointer' (3-bit register pointing to current write position), 'read_pointer' (3-bit register for read position), and 'count' (4-bit register tracking number of items in FIFO).
 
The Verilog code has three primary blocks controlled by the 'clk' and 'reset' signals. One block handles the 'write_pointer' updates and data writing into 'memory_vec' when 'write_en' is active and FIFO is not full. Another block updates the 'read_pointer' and sets the output 'out' when 'read_en' is active and FIFO is not empty. The third block adjusts the 'count' of stored items based on write or read operations, increasing on writes (if not full) and decreasing on reads (if not empty). These operations allow the FIFO to function correctly under various conditions, ensuring synchronized data storage and retrieval.
