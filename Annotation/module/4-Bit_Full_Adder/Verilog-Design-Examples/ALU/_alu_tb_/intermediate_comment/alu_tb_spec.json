    "spec": "Module name: alu_tb.  \nModule specification: The `alu_tb` module functions as a testbench to verify the behavior of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), connected as a device under test (DUT) named `dut`. It operates by initiating varying test cases using the `stimulus` task that assigns random values to its inputs: `a`, `b`, and `select`. `a` and `b` are 4-bit registers serving as operands for the ALU, while `select` is a 2-bit register that determines the ALU operation type such as addition or subtraction. The outputs of the ALU, systematically checked by the testbench, include `out`, a 4-bit result of the ALU operations, and several single-bit flags: `zero` for indicating a zero result, `carry` for indicating an overflow from the most significant bit, `sign` for result sign indication, `parity` for even or odd parity, and `overflow` for arithmetic overflow status. Internally, the `new_out` 4-bit register holds the expected ALU output, compared against the actual `out` from the ALU as an accuracy check. The code consists of the instantiation of the `ALU`, initial setup for repetitive test cycles, a comparison logic post time delay, and the `stimulus` task that randomizes input values and assigns them respectively. Employment of extensive output messages facilitates immediate insight regarding test success or failure, enhancing debugging efficacy.",

The module sets up various test cases through the `stimulus` task, which randomly generates inputs for the ALU. It assigns these inputs to registers `a`, `b`, and `select`.
