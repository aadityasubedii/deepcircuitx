The `alu_tb` module is designed to test the functionality of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) by simulating various operational scenarios using random sets of inputs (`a`, `b`, and `select`) and checking the outputs (`out`, `zero`, `carry`, `sign`, `parity`, `overflow`) against expected results. Implementation includes an initial block to run multiple test cases, a stimulus task generating random inputs, and comparison logic to assert the correctness of the ALU's operations, all facilitating comprehensive assessment and debugging of the ALU's behavior.
