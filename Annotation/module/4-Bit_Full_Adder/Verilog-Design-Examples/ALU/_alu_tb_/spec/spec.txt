Module name: alu_tb.  
Module specification: The `alu_tb` module functions as a testbench to verify the behavior of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), connected as a device under test (DUT) named `dut`. It operates by initiating varying test cases using the `stimulus` task that assigns random values to its inputs: `a`, `b`, and `select`. `a` and `b` are 4-bit registers serving as operands for the ALU, while `select` is a 2-bit register that determines the ALU operation type such as addition or subtraction. The outputs of the ALU, systematically checked by the testbench, include `out`, a 4-bit result of the ALU operations, and several single-bit flags: `zero` for indicating a zero result, `carry` for indicating an overflow from the most significant bit, `sign` for result sign indication, `parity` for even or odd parity, and `overflow` for arithmetic overflow status. Internally, the `new_out` 4-bit register holds the expected ALU output, compared against the actual `out` from the ALU as an accuracy check. The code consists of the instantiation of the `ALU`, initial setup for repetitive test cycles, a comparison logic post time delay, and the `stimulus` task that randomizes input values and assigns them respectively. Employment of extensive output messages facilitates immediate insight regarding test success or failure, enhancing debugging efficacy.
