The 'alu' module serves as an Arithmetic Logic Unit that executes arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on 4-bit operands based on a selector input. It employs a combinational logic block that reacts to changes in input operands or operation selections, using a case statement to process and determine both the resulting value and various flags such as zero, carry, sign, parity, and overflow indicators, encapsulating comprehensive arithmetic functionalities essential for computational modules.
