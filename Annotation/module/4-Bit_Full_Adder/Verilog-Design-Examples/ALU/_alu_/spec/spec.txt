Module name: alu. Module specification: The 'alu' module is a Verilog hardware description for an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that performs basic arithmetic operations -- addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division -- on 4-bit operands. The module inputs include two 4-bit numbers, 'a' and 'b', and a 2-bit 'select' signal that determines the operation to be performed: '00' for addition, '01' for subtraction, '10' for multiplication, and '11' for division. The outputs are a 4-bit result 'out' and flags 'zero', 'carry', 'sign', 'parity', and 'overflow'. The internal signals are used mainly for flag setting: 'carry' monitors overflows in addition and subtraction, 'zero' indicates a zero result, 'sign' provides the sign of the result, 'parity' displays even or odd number of 1â€™s in the result, and 'overflow' flags arithmetic range overflows. In the module's logic, a combinational block driven by changes in 'a' or 'b' uses a case statement to execute the arithmetic based on 'select', and consequentially sets the flags based on the operation results. This design adequately handles dynamic arithmetic processing, making it integral for supporting computational tasks in larger digital systems.
