The dff_sync module implements a synchronous D flip-flop, capturing input data on the positive edge of a clock unless reset is active, when it sets output to zero. It utilizes an always block to update the output `o_q` based on clock and reset signal, with an assign statement ensuring the output `o_qb` is always the logical inverse of `o_q`.
