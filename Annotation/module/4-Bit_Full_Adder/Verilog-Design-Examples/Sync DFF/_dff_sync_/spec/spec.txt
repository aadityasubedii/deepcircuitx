Module name: dff_sync. 
Module specification: The dff_sync module implements a synchronous D flip-flop. It is designed to store the value of the data input (`i_d`) to the output (`o_q`) on a positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`), provided that the reset signal (`reset`) is not active. If `reset` is active, the output (`o_q`) is set to 0. The inputs to this module include `i_d` for data input, `clk` for the clock signal, and `reset` for the reset condition. The outputs are `o_q`, which holds the stored data, and `o_qb`, which is the logical inverse of `o_q` ensuring that `o_qb` is always the complement of `o_q`. Internally, the module uses the register `o_q` to hold the value of the input data post the clock's positive edge, which is reset to 0 under an active reset condition. The module prominently features an `always` block that handles the logic for updating `o_q` based on the clock and reset conditions, and an `assign` statement, which continuously updates `o_qb` as the inverse of `o_q`. This design ensures the module responds correctly to clock edges and reset conditions, maintaining the correct output states.
