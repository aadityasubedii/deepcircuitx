The `dff_sync_tb` module serves as a testbench for a synchronous D flip-flop, ensuring it correctly captures input data on clock edges and handles asynchronous resets. It generates a continuous clock and uses randomized inputs for data and reset in a `stimulus` task, running 100 iterations where each iteration compares the flip-flop output with input data, reporting the results as pass or fail based on matching output. This ensures thorough testing under varied conditions, validating the flip-flop's functionality efficiently.
