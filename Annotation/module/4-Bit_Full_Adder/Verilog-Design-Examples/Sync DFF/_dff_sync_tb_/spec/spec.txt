Module name: dff_sync_tb.  
Module specification: The module `dff_sync_tb` functions as a testbench for validating the behavior of a synchronous D flip-flop implemented in a separate module referenced here as `dff_sync`. The testbench primarily stimulates this flip-flop with random data (`d`) and reset signals (`reset`) and checks the outputs `q` and `qb` for correct operation. Input ports include `d`, a data input that defines the value to capture on the rising clock edge; `clk`, the clock signal that toggles continuously to drive the flip-flop timing; and `reset`, which asynchronously clears the output to a known state. Output ports consist of `q`, the direct output reflecting the captured data, and `qb`, which holds the logical complement of `q`. The internal signals comprise registers for `d`, `clk`, and `reset`, with `q` and `qb` being wire connections to the flip-flopâ€™s outputs. The Verilog code contains distinct blocks: an initialization block that generates the clock signal, another to perform 100 test iterations invoking a `stimulus` task which randomizes `d` and `reset`, and checks the outputs thereafter, outputting a pass or fail message based on the correctness of `q` relative to `d` under non-reset conditions. The `stimulus` task updates `d` and `reset` every 5 time units, thereby providing varied test conditions during the simulation. This structured framework helps to ensure thorough testing of the D flip-flop's response to various input conditions, highlighting the reliable design verification process achieved by this testbench.
