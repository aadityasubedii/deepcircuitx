Module name: singleport_ram. Module specification: The 'singleport_ram' is a Verilog module designed to function as a single-port RAM with synchronous read and write capabilities. This module features several input ports: 'clk' (clock signal) which synchronizes the operations, 'wr_en' (write enable) that allows data to be written to the RAM when asserted, 'addr' (3-bit address line) which specifies the target RAM location for both read and write operations, and 'data_in' (128-bit data input) used for writing data into the RAM. There is one output port, 'data_out' (128-bit), that outputs data stored at the location specified by the internally latched address from 'read_addr'. Internally, the module utilizes a register array 'ram_vector' with 8 elements (each 128 bits) to store the RAM contents, and a 3-bit register 'read_addr' that latches the address on each positive clock edge for consistent data output in successive cycles. The operations within the module are governed by an 'always' block that handles data writing when 'wr_en' is high and address latching at every positive clock edge, and a continuous assignment that maps the output 'data_out' to the data stored at the 'read_addr' location in 'ram_vector'. This module is essential for applications requiring reliable data storage and retrieval synchronized with a system clock.
