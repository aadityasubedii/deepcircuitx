It takes a 128-bit data input which it writes to a RAM vector of 8 locations (each 128 bits wide) when the write enable (wr_en) signal is active and the clock (clk) signal has a rising edge. The RAM module uses a 3-bit address input to determine which of the 8 locations to access. Regardless of the write operation, it always latches the address input to read_addr on each clock's rising edge. The output data_out always presents the data stored at the location specified by read_addr. This RAM allows for data writing and reading in synchronous with the clock signal, with immediate address latching for potential read of the same data in the following cycles if the address remains unchanged."

Explanation: \n- clk: This is the clock input used to synchronize the write and read operations within the RAM module.\n- wr_en: This is the write enable signal. When active (high), it allows data to be written into the RAM at the address specified by the `addr` input.\n- addr: This is a 3-bit address input that specifies which of the 8 locations in the RAM vector the data should be written to or read from.\n- data_in: This is a 128-bit input port that provides the data to be written into the RAM when the write enable (wr_en) is active.\n\nOutput ports: data_out. Explanation:\n- data_out: This is a 128-bit output port that outputs data from the RAM.
