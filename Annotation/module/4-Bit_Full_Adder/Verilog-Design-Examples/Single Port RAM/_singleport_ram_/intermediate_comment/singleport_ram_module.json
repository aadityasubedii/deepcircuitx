    "module": "The singleport_ram module functions as a single-port RAM, enabling data storage and retrieval synchronized with a clock signal. It uses input ports for the clock (clk), write enable (wr_en), address (addr), and data (data_in), with wr_en controlling data writes to an 8-location RAM vector (ram_vector) indexed by addr. The address is latched into read_addr on each clock's rising edge, ensuring consistent data output (data_out) from ram_vector based on the latched address, independent of subsequent address changes."
