    "spec": "Module name: singleport_ram. Module specification: The 'singleport_ram' is a Verilog module designed to function as a single-port RAM with synchronous read and write capabilities. This module features several input ports: 'clk' (clock signal) which synchronizes the operations, 'wr_en' (write enable) that allows data to be written to the RAM when asserted, 'addr' (3-bit address line) which specifies the target RAM location for both read and write operations, and 'data_in' (128-bit data input) used for writing data into the RAM. There is one output port, 'data_out' (128-bit), that outputs data stored at the location specified by the internally latched address from 'read_addr'. Internally, the module utilizes a register array 'ram_vector' with 8 elements (each 128 bits) to store the RAM contents, and a 3-bit register 'read_addr' that latches the address on each positive clock edge for consistent data output in successive cycles. The operations within the module are governed by an 'always' block that handles data writing when 'wr_en' is high and address latching at every positive clock edge, and a continuous assignment that maps the output 'data_out' to the data stored at the 'read_addr' location in 'ram_vector'. This module is essential for applications requiring reliable data storage and retrieval synchronized with a system clock.",

It takes a 128-bit data input which it writes to a RAM vector of 8 locations (each 128 bits wide) when the write enable (wr_en) signal is active and the clock (clk) signal has a rising edge. The RAM module uses a 3-bit address input to determine which of the 8 locations to access. Regardless of the write operation, it always latches the address input to read_addr on each clock's rising edge. The output data_out always presents the data stored at the location specified by read_addr. This RAM allows for data writing and reading in synchronous with the clock signal, with immediate address latching for potential read of the same data in the following cycles if the address remains unchanged."

Explanation:\n- data_out: This is a 128-bit output port that outputs data from the RAM.
