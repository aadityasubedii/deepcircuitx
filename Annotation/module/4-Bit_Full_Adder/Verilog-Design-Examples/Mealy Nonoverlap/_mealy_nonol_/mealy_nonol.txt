The 'mealy_nonol' module implements a Mealy state machine with four states, responding to input 'in' to adjust its state and produce output 'out'. It operates with a synchronous reset and clock, using two 2-bit registers 'present_state' and 'next_state' for managing transitions. The module transitions state based on 'in' and current state, updating outputs correspondingly, all controlled by combinational and sequential logic in always blocks.
