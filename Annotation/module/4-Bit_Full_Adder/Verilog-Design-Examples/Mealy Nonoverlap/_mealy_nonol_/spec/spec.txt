Module name: mealy_nonol. Module specification: The 'mealy_nonol' module implements a Mealy state machine with four states (S0, S1, S2, S3), driven by the input 'in'. It determines the next state and produces an output 'out' based on the current state and the 'in' signal. The module includes an input port 'in' which influences state transitions, a 'clk' input that provides the timing reference for state transitions and output logic, and a 'reset' input that asynchronously resets the state machine to the initial state S0. The output port 'out' depends on the current state and the input 'in', specifically outputting a 1 in state S3 when 'in' is 1, and 0 otherwise. Internally, the module uses two 2-bit registers: 'present_state', which holds the machine's current state, and 'next_state', which temporarily stores the next state during state transition logic evaluation. The code includes two main always blocks: one triggered by the positive edge of 'clk' or 'reset' which handles state progression, and another combinational logic block sensitive to 'present_state' and 'in', handling state transition decisions and output assignments.
