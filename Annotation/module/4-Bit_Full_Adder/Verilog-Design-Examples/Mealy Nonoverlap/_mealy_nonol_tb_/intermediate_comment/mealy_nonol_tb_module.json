    "module": "The `mealy_nonol_tb` module acts as a testbench for the `mealy_nonol` Mealy machine, using random binary inputs to verify the detection of specific sequences like `1101`. It utilizes a series of initial and always blocks to simulate clock signals and state transitions, internal signals for state monitoring (`ps`, `ns`) and output comparison (`new_out`), and tasks for stimulus generation, ensuring thorough testing and verification of the DUT's response accuracy."
