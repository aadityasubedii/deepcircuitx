This machine processes a sequence of binary input signals driven by a random stimulus. It transitions through states S0 to S3 based on the input values and produces an output signal indicating specific detected binary sequences. The testbench checks if the output from the DUT (`out`) matches an expected output (`new_out`) calculated within the testbench itself based on defined state transitions and inputs. Special attention is given to detecting the sequence `1101`, where the testbench provides affirmation when this specific sequence is detected as per the output from the logic."

It represents the binary input signal that is processed by the Mealy machine to trigger state transitions and output generation based on the logic defined in the module.\n- `clk`: This is the clock input that synchronizes the operations in the module. It ensures that the state transitions and output evaluations occur at defined times (edge-triggered).\n- `reset`: This input is used to reset the state of the Mealy machine to an initial state `S0`. It is typically used at the beginning of operations or to reinitialize the system during or after disruptions.\n\nOutput ports: `out`.\nExplanation:\n- `out`: This is the output port that represents whether a specific binary sequence (like `1101`) has been detected by the Mealy machine based on the input `in` and the current state. This output is used in the testbench to compare against a calculated expected output (`new_out`) to verify the correctness of the Mealy machine behaviors."

It holds a value representing whether a certain condition (like input sequence matching `1101`) is met within the states before the actual output is set. This temporary output is used mainly for verification against the `out` signal in the testbench.\n- `ps`: Stands for \"present state\". This register holds the current state of the Mealy machine. It is updated at each positive edge of the clock (`clk`) or when a reset (`reset`) event occurs. The value of `ps` determines how inputs affect the state transitions and outputs.\n- `ns`: Stands for \"next state\". This register is calculated every cycle based on the current state (`ps`) and the input (`in`). It represents the state to which the system should transition in the next clock cycle. Once the clock edge arrives, the value of `ns` becomes the new value of `ps`. This mechanism allows for controlled state transitions based on input and current state."
