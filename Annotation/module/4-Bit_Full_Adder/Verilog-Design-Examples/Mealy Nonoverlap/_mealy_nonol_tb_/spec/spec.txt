Module name: mealy_nonol_tb.

Module specification: The `mealy_nonol_tb` module is a testbench designed to verify the behavior of a Mealy machine realized in another module, referred to as `mealy_nonol`. This testbench module inputs random binary stimuli to the Device Under Test (DUT) and checks its output for correctness. The input ports include `in` for the binary data, `clk` for clock pulses to synchronize operations, and `reset` to initialize the state machine to state `S0`. The output port, `out`, indicates if a specific binary sequence (1101) is detected. Internally, `ps` (present state) and `ns` (next state) are used to keep track of current and future states, and `new_out` is a temporary output for verification against `out`. The code consists of several blocks: initialization of reset and clock, a loop generating stimuli and comparing outputs, definitions of tasks for stimuli, and always blocks handling state transitions and output logic based on the current state and inputs. The meticulous structure ensures the proper functioning of the Mealy machine through controlled state transitions, accurate detection, and output verification, enabling robust testing of sequence detection logic within the DUT.
