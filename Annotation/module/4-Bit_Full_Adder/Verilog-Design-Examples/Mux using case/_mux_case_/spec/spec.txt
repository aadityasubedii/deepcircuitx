Module name: mux_case. Module specification: The Verilog module `mux_case` is designed to implement a 2-bit 4-to-1 multiplexer utilizing a case statement to select one of four 2-bit input signals based on a 2-bit selector. The inputs include `in0`, `in1`, `in2`, and `in3`, each a 2-bit signal representing potential data sources for the output. The `select` input, also a 2-bit signal, determines which input (`in0` to `in3`) is routed to the 2-bit output `out`. There are no internal signals employed in this module; it directly uses its input ports within the logic implementation. The primary logic of the module resides within an `always` block triggered by changes to the `select` signal. Within this block, a `case` statement is used to assign the appropriate input signal to the output `out` depending on the value of `select`. This setup ensures that changes in the selector immediately and correctly update the output signal, making the module suitable for applications requiring efficient data routing based on dynamic control signals.
