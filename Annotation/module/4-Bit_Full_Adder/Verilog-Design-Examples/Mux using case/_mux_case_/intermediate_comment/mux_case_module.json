    "module": "The `mux_case` module implements a 2-bit 4-to-1 multiplexer, selecting one of four 2-bit inputs (`in0`, `in1`, `in2`, `in3`) based on a 2-bit selector (`select`). The selection logic is encapsulated within an `always` block that employs a `case` statement, which maps the `select` value directly to the corresponding input, updating the 2-bit output `out` accordingly. This design provides immediate response to selector changes, ensuring efficient data routing."
