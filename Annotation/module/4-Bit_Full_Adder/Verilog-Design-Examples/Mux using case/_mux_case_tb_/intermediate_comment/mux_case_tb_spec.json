    "spec": "Module name: mux_case_tb. \nModule specification: The module `mux_case_tb` serves as a testbench for verifying the functionality of a 4-way multiplexer, modelled by another module referred to as `mux_case`. The inputs to this multiplexer are controlled by four 2-bit registers, `in0`, `in1`, `in2`, and `in3`, with a selection facilitated by a 2-bit input register `select`. The selection logic, determined by the `select` input, chooses which input data (`in0` to `in3`) is directed to the 2-bit output wire `out`. An internal 2-bit register `new_out` is used to compute and hold the expected output based on the select input within the `stimulus` task. This expected output is compared against the actual multiplexer output to verify correct functionality, outputting a pass or fail message for each test instance. Within the testbench, there's an initial block that sets the preliminary input values for `in0` to `in3` and triggers 100 test iterations using the `stimulus` task. The `stimulus` task itself computes `new_out` depending on `select` and updates the `select` input randomly to simulate different scenarios, which are then checked against the multiplexer output in the initial block.",

In this testbench, it uses a task named `stimulus` to generate random selections (via `select`) and sets the expected output (`new_out`) based on the selection. The mux_case_tb repeatedly checks the functionality of the 4-way multiplexer by comparing the output from the multiplexer (`out`) against the expected output (`new_out`). It prints a message indicating whether the test passed or failed based on this comparison, detailing the current states of the selection bits and outputs. This testbench effectively validates that the multiplexer unit under test routes the correct input to the output based on the value of the select inputs."

The `select` input is a 2-bit value used to choose one of the four data inputs.
