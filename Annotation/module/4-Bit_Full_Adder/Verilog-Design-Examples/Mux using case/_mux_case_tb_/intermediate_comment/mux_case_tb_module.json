    "module": "The `mux_case_tb` module is designed as a testbench to validate the operation of a 4-way multiplexer by simulating various input scenarios and checking the multiplexer's output. It initializes the inputs, uses a task to generate random selections and expected outputs, and iteratively tests these against the actual multiplexer output, reporting the results."
