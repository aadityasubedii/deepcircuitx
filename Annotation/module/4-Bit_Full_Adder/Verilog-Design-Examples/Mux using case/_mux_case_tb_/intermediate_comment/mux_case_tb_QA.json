In this testbench, it uses a task named `stimulus` to generate random selections (via `select`) and sets the expected output (`new_out`) based on the selection. The mux_case_tb repeatedly checks the functionality of the 4-way multiplexer by comparing the output from the multiplexer (`out`) against the expected output (`new_out`). It prints a message indicating whether the test passed or failed based on this comparison, detailing the current states of the selection bits and outputs. This testbench effectively validates that the multiplexer unit under test routes the correct input to the output based on the value of the select inputs."

The `select` input is a 2-bit value used to choose one of the four data inputs.
