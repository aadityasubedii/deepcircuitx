Module name: mux_case_tb. 
Module specification: The module `mux_case_tb` serves as a testbench for verifying the functionality of a 4-way multiplexer, modelled by another module referred to as `mux_case`. The inputs to this multiplexer are controlled by four 2-bit registers, `in0`, `in1`, `in2`, and `in3`, with a selection facilitated by a 2-bit input register `select`. The selection logic, determined by the `select` input, chooses which input data (`in0` to `in3`) is directed to the 2-bit output wire `out`. An internal 2-bit register `new_out` is used to compute and hold the expected output based on the select input within the `stimulus` task. This expected output is compared against the actual multiplexer output to verify correct functionality, outputting a pass or fail message for each test instance. Within the testbench, there's an initial block that sets the preliminary input values for `in0` to `in3` and triggers 100 test iterations using the `stimulus` task. The `stimulus` task itself computes `new_out` depending on `select` and updates the `select` input randomly to simulate different scenarios, which are then checked against the multiplexer output in the initial block.
