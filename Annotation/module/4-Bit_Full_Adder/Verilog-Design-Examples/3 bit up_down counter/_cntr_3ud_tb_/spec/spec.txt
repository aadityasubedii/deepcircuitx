Module name: cntr_3ud_tb. Module specification: The 'cntr_3ud_tb' module is designed as a testbench for verifying the operation of a counter module named 'cntr_3ud', which can count either upwards or downwards based on the input. It consists of input ports: 'up_down', which dictates the counting direction (high for down and low for up); 'clk', a clock signal that toggles every 5 time units, stimulating the counterâ€™s operation; and 'reset', which initializes the counter to its default state when high. The output port 'bin_count' is a 3-bit wide signal representing the counter's output value. Internally, the 'new_count' signal, also 3 bits, holds the expected counter value for comparison purposes. The code is organized into a few key blocks: the clock generator using an infinite loop with a delay, a reset control block that initially holds the counter in reset, an always block sensitive to the positive edge of the clock handling the stimulus application, new_count updating, and the validation of the counter's output against expected values, and a task named 'stimulus' that randomly sets the 'up_down' direction. This structured approach allows systematic testing and monitoring of the counter's functionality and performance under varying conditions.
