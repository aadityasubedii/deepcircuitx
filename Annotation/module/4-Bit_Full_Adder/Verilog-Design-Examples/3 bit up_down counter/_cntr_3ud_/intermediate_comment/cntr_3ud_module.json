    "module": "The 'cntr_3ud' module is a 3-bit up/down counter that increments or decrements based on the 'up_down' control signal. It operates on the positive edge of 'clk', resetting 'bin_count' to 0 with a high 'reset'. The counting direction is controlled by 'up_down', where high decrements and low increments the 'bin_count', achieving a flexible counting mechanism synchronized with system clock events."
