Module name: half_adder_tb. Module specification: The 'half_adder_tb' is a Verilog testbench module designed to verify the functionality of a half adder circuit. It inputs two random binary values, 'a' and 'b', to the half adder and checks if the outputs, 'sum' and 'carry', are computed correctly. The inputs are single-bit binary values used to stimulate the half adder circuit connected via the input ports 'a' and 'b'. The output ports from the half adder are 'sum' and 'carry', which each output a single bit representing the result of binary addition and the corresponding carry-out, respectively. Internally, the module uses registers 'new_sum' and 'new_carry' to store directly calculated values of sum and carry using a simple addition operation, which are then used to verify the correctness of the half adderâ€™s outputs. The code includes an 'initial' block to repeat tests 10 times by calling the 'stimulus' task, generating random bits, assigning them to the inputs, performing the direct addition, and checking the outputs from the half adder against the calculated values to determine the pass/fail status of each test case. This effectively proves if the half adder logic within its designated unit ('dut') behaves as expected under various test scenarios.
