The 'half_adder_tb' module tests the functionality of a half adder circuit by stimulating it with random binary inputs and verifying the correctness of its binary addition outputs. It employs an 'initial' block to run tests iteratively, using a 'stimulus' task to generate random inputs and compute expected results, subsequently comparing these with the half adder's outputs to assess performance and correctness.
