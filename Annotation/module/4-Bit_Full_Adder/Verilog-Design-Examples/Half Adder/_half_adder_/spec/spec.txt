Module name: half_adder. Module specification: The half_adder module is a fundamental digital logic circuit designed in Verilog, intended for adding two single-bit binary inputs, i_a and i_b. It features two inputs and two outputs, where i_a and i_b represent the bits to be added. The outputs, o_sum and o_carry, convey the sum and carry resultant from the addition respectively; o_sum uses the XOR operation on i_a and i_b to reflect the sum excluding the carry, while o_carry employs the AND operation to indicate the presence of a carry from the addition. Internally, the module does not utilize any intermediate signals; the assignments to o_sum and o_carry are direct, simplifying the design and enhancing clarity. The code is structured efficiently with clear port declarations and straightforward logic assignments, making it easy to understand and integrate into larger digital systems.
