    "module": "The half_adder module performs binary addition of two single-bit inputs, i_a and i_b, producing a sum and a carry output. It computes the sum output (o_sum) using the XOR operation on the inputs to exclude any carry, and calculates the carry output (o_carry) using the AND operation, showing the carry generated in the addition. This module directly maps inputs to outputs using simple logic gates for clarity and efficiency in digital circuit designs."
