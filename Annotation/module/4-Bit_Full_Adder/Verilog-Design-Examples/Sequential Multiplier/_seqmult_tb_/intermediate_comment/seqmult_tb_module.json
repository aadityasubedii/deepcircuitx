    "module": "The `seqmult_tb` module is a testbench for verifying a sequential multiplier by comparing expected and actual multiplication results of two 8-bit inputs. It manages synchronization and state using a clock (`clk`), input triggers (`load`), and reset signal (`reset`), controlling an instantiated DUT via these inputs. Random input stimuli are generated, and correctness is checked in a procedural block that evaluates the output against expected results calculated internally, ensuring DUT functionality across varying conditions."
