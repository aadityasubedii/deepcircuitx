Module name: seqmult_tb. Module specification: The `seqmult_tb` is a dedicated testbench module designed to validate the functioning of a sequential multiplier, `seqmult`, which processes two 8-bit inputs to produce a 16-bit output. The main inputs to this testbench include `in_a` and `in_b` (8-bit values representing multiplicands), `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `load` (control signal to trigger multiplication), and `reset` (asynchronous reset to clear results and signals). Outputs consist of `out_valid` (indicates readiness of the output product `out_prod` calculated by the DUT). Internally, the testbench uses signals `new_out` (16-bit register holding the expected product result calculated by the testbench) and `new_valid` (indicates the validity of `new_out`). The Verilog code comprises several procedural blocks: an initial block setting up and toggling the clock, another initializing and controlling reset and load signals, and one performing a stimulus task followed by result verification against `new_out`. The always block, triggered on the positive clock edge or reset, handles the updating of `new_out` and `new_valid` based on the status of `load` and `reset`. Tasks include `stimulus` for randomizing input values. Collectively, these components and their interactive functionalities ensure that the testbench comprehensively tests and validates the sequential multiplier by comparing its outputs against internally generated expected results under varied scenarios.
