    "module": "The seqmult module performs sequential multiplication of two 8-bit inputs (in_a and in_b) using a shift-and-add method, synchronized by a clock and an asynchronous reset. On reception of a 'load' signal, the module shifts in_b based on the bits of in_a, accumulates the results in internal registers (p1 to p8), and outputs a 16-bit product (out_prod) with a validity signal (out_valid) when the multiplication is complete. The module resets outputs to default states upon reset activation."
