    "spec": "Module name: seqmult. \nModule specification: The seqmult module is designed for sequential multiplication of two 8-bit numbers utilizing shift-and-add methodology, controlled by a synchronous clock and an asynchronous reset. It accepts two 8-bit inputs, in_a and in_b, used as the multiplicand and multiplier, respectively. The clock (clk) input synchronizes the internal sequential operations, and the load input initiates the multiplication process. An asynchronous reset (reset) clears the output product and the valid signal. The outputs are a 16-bit product (out_prod) and a validation flag (out_valid) which indicates when the multiplication result is available. Internally, seqmult uses nine registers (p1 to p8 for storing shifted products and temp_prod for zero-extension of in_b) to compute the product based on the bits of in_a. Each register p1 to p8 stores the value of in_b shifted left by 0 to 7 positions, depending on the corresponding bit in in_a. Modules are sequenced such that on a load event, each p register is evaluated for shifting, followed by accumulation to produce the final result stored in out_prod, simultaneously setting out_valid high to indicate the result's availability. If reset is triggered, out_prod is set to high impedance ('z') and out_valid to low, effectively halting the operation and indicating an invalid output state.",

The module is synchronous with a clock (clk) and can be reset asynchronously (reset). The multiplication result is presented as a 16-bit output (out_prod), and the validity of this output is indicated by the out_valid signal. On receiving a 'load' signal, the multiplication process starts, considering each bit of in_a to selectively shift in_b left by increasing bit positions (from 0 to 7) and then accumulating these shifted values if the corresponding bit in in_a is one. This process effectively multiplies in_a by in_b using a shift-and-add method. When the load signal is active, and the multiplication completes, out_valid is set high. If the module is reset, the output product is set to high impedance ('z') and out_valid is set low."

Each register (p1 to p8) corresponds to a bit (0 to 7) in the input `in_a`. If the relevant bit in `in_a` is high, the corresponding register will store the `in_b` left-shifted by the bit's position (0 to 7); otherwise, it will store zero.\n- temp_prod: This is a 16-bit wire that acts as the baseline intermediate product, which replicates the value of `in_b` zero-extended to 16 bits (`{8'b0, in_b}`). This wire is used as the base value for the shift calculations stored in p1 through p8."

                    "text": "Module name: seqmult. \nModule specification: The seqmult module is designed for sequential multiplication of two 8-bit numbers utilizing shift-and-add methodology, controlled by a synchronous clock and an asynchronous reset. It accepts two 8-bit inputs, in_a and in_b, used as the multiplicand and multiplier, respectively. The clock (clk) input synchronizes the internal sequential operations, and the load input initiates the multiplication process. An asynchronous reset (reset) clears the output product and the valid signal. The outputs are a 16-bit product (out_prod) and a validation flag (out_valid) which indicates when the multiplication result is available. Internally, seqmult uses nine registers (p1 to p8 for storing shifted products and temp_prod for zero-extension of in_b) to compute the product based on the bits of in_a. Each register p1 to p8 stores the value of in_b shifted left by 0 to 7 positions, depending on the corresponding bit in in_a. Modules are sequenced such that on a load event, each p register is evaluated for shifting, followed by accumulation to produce the final result stored in out_prod, simultaneously setting out_valid high to indicate the result's availability. If reset is triggered, out_prod is set to high impedance ('z') and out_valid to low, effectively halting the operation and indicating an invalid output state."
