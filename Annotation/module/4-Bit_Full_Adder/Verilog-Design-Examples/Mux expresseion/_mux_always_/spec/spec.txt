Module name: mux_always. Module specification: The "mux_always" module is designed to implement a 2-to-1 multiplexer using Verilog. It controls the flow of two input signals, 'in0' and 'in1', to a single output 'out' based on a select signal 'select'. When the 'select' signal is 0, 'in0' is passed to the output, and when 'select' is 1, 'in1' is passed instead. This behavior is achieved without using internal signals, relying solely on direct logical operations performed on the inputs. The input ports include 'in0' and 'in1', which are the signals to be selected between, and 'select', which determines which input is forwarded to the output. The only output port is 'out', which outputs the value of the selected input signal. The module efficiently handles the selection using an 'assign' statement that combines bitwise AND and OR operations to derive the output based directly on the values of the input and select signals. This concise approach allows the multiplexer functionality to be implemented in a straightforward and resource-efficient manner.
