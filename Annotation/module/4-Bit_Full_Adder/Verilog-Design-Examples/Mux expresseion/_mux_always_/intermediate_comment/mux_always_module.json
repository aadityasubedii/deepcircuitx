    "module": "The mux_always module is a 2-to-1 multiplexer that selects between two input signals 'in0' and 'in1' based on the value of a select signal 'select'. It outputs the selected input through the 'out' port by utilizing a logical combination of bitwise AND and OR operations in a direct assignment statement, thereby simplifying the selection process and minimizing internal complexity."
