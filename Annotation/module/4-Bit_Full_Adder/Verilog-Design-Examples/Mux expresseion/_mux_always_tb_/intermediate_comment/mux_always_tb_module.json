    "module": "The \"mux_always_tb\" module functions as a testbench for verifying a multiplexer by applying 100 iterations of randomized inputs 'in0', 'in1', and 'select', and checking if the output 'out' matches the expected 'new_out'. Implementation involves invoking a 'stimulus' task to simulate and set conditions for each test, followed by displaying results based on the comparison of 'new_out' and 'out' for test validation."
