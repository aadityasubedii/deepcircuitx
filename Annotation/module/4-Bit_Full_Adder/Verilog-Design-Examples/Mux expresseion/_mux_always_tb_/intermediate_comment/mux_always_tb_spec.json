    "spec": "Module name: mux_always_tb. Module specification: The \"mux_always_tb\" module serves as a testbench designed specifically to verify the correct functionality of a multiplexer circuit defined in a separate \"mux_always\" module. The testbench makes use of one-bit binary input signals 'in0' and 'in1', which represent the two data inputs to the multiplexer, and a 'select' signal that determines which of these inputs should be forwarded to the output. The output 'out' is a wire that displays the multiplexer's selection result. Internally, the module utilizes a 'new_out' signal, a register storing expected output values for comparison against the 'out' to verify correct multiplexer operation. The test involves randomly initializing 'in0', 'in1', and 'select' for 100 iterations, within which a 'stimulus' task is repeatedly called to set up the conditions for each test and update 'new_out'. After invoking 'stimulus', a delay of 5 time units prefaces a comparison between 'new_out' and 'out'. If these match, the test is marked 'Passed', otherwise 'Failed'. The outcome of each test, alongside the values of 'in0', 'in1', 'select', 'out', and 'new_out', is displayed accordingly. This rigorous sequential testing ensures thorough verification of the multiplexer's functionality under various input conditions.",

In the testbench, 'in0' and 'in1' are inputs whose values are determined randomly for each trial. The 'select' signal determines which of the inputs ('in0' or 'in1') is passed as the output 'out'.
