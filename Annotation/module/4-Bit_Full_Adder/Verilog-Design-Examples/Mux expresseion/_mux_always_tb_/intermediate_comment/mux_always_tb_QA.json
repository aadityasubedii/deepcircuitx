In the testbench, 'in0' and 'in1' are inputs whose values are determined randomly for each trial. The 'select' signal determines which of the inputs ('in0' or 'in1') is passed as the output 'out'. The module repeatedly (100 times) tests the multiplexer operation by applying random inputs and a random select signal to verify if the multiplexer properly outputs the selected input. The result of each test case is displayed as 'Passed' or 'Failed' based on a comparison between a calculated 'new_out' (expected output) and the actual 'out' from the multiplexer. The determination of 'new_out' and the output check occur in a 'stimulus' task that is called in each iteration of the test."
