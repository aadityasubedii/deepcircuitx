Module name: mux_always_tb. Module specification: The "mux_always_tb" module serves as a testbench designed specifically to verify the correct functionality of a multiplexer circuit defined in a separate "mux_always" module. The testbench makes use of one-bit binary input signals 'in0' and 'in1', which represent the two data inputs to the multiplexer, and a 'select' signal that determines which of these inputs should be forwarded to the output. The output 'out' is a wire that displays the multiplexer's selection result. Internally, the module utilizes a 'new_out' signal, a register storing expected output values for comparison against the 'out' to verify correct multiplexer operation. The test involves randomly initializing 'in0', 'in1', and 'select' for 100 iterations, within which a 'stimulus' task is repeatedly called to set up the conditions for each test and update 'new_out'. After invoking 'stimulus', a delay of 5 time units prefaces a comparison between 'new_out' and 'out'. If these match, the test is marked 'Passed', otherwise 'Failed'. The outcome of each test, alongside the values of 'in0', 'in1', 'select', 'out', and 'new_out', is displayed accordingly. This rigorous sequential testing ensures thorough verification of the multiplexer's functionality under various input conditions.
