    "module": "The no_1s module counts the number of '1's in a 16-bit input vector `i_a`, synchronizing its operations with a clock signal `clk` and providing the ability to reset through the `reset` signal. Within an `always` block triggered on the clock's rising edge, the module checks if `reset` is active to clear the count, otherwise, it increments a count `no_ones` whenever a '1' is detected in the current bit of `i_a`, managed via an integer index `i` which is also incremented each cycle until all bits are checked."
