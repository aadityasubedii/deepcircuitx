It operates on the rising edge of the clock signal `clk`. When the `reset` signal is active, it resets the count to zero. Otherwise, it sequentially checks each bit of the input vector `i_a` and increments the count held in `no_ones` for each '1' bit encountered. The checking of bits in `i_a` and updating of `no_ones` continues in each clock cycle until all bits in `i_a` are examined."

The module checks each bit of this vector to count the number of '1's.\n\nOutput ports: no_ones.\nExplanation: \n- `no_ones`: This is a 4-bit output register that holds the count of '1' bits in the input vector `i_a`.

It starts from 0 and increments in each clock cycle until it reaches 15, ensuring that each bit of `i_a` is checked. The value of `i` is used to reference the current bit of `i_a` that is being examined to determine if it is a '1', such that if `i_a[i]` is '1', the `no_ones` count is incremented.
