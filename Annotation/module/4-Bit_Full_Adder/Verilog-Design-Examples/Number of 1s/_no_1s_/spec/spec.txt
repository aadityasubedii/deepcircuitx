Module name: no_1s. Module specification: The no_1s module is designed to count the number of '1's in a 16-bit input vector labeled as `i_a`. This counting operation is synchronized with a clock signal `clk` and can be reset through an active `reset` signal. The module comprises of input ports `clk` (clock), `reset`, and `i_a`. `clk` is used to trigger operations on the rising edge, ensuring systematic processing for each clock cycle. `reset` serves to reinitialize the output count `no_ones` to zero whenever it becomes active. The input vector `i_a` is a 16-bit vector which the module examines bit by bit to calculate the number of '1' bits. The result of this process is held in the output register `no_ones`, which is a 4-bit register showing the count of '1's from the `i_a` vector. Internally, the module utilizes an integer signal `i` which functions as an index to access each specific bit within `i_a`. This index is incremented every clock cycle and is used to reference the individual bits in the counting process. The main code block that controls operations is an `always` block activated at every positive edge of the clock. This block checks if the `reset` signal is active; if so, it resets `no_ones` to zero, otherwise, it proceeds with the counting if the index `i` is less than 16, and then increments the index `i` for the next cycle. This effective structuring facilitates the continuous and accurate counting of '1's within the input vector throughout the module's operation.
