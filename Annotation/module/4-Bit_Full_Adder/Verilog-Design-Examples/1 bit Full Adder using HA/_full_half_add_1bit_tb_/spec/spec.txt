Module name: full_half_add_1bit_tb. 
Module specification: The 'full_half_add_1bit_tb' is a testbench module designed to validate the correctness of a 1-bit full adder, with capabilities to also test half-adder setups. It features three input ports: 'a', 'b', and 'cin', representing the two operands and the carry-in of the addition operation, respectively. The outputs of the Verilog module are 'sum' and 'carry', which are used to indicate the result of the addition and any carry-out generated. Additionally, internal signals 'new_sum' and 'new_carry' are used to store the expected results of the addition operation, which are then compared to the actual outputs from the device under test (DUT). The module consists of a main initial block that systematically generates random binary inputs for 100 test iterations, applies these to both the DUT and the internal expected result computation, and checks for matches between DUT outputs and expected values to validate correct functionality. To inject test vectors, a 'stimulus' task is defined, which randomly generates values for 'A', 'B', and 'Cin', calculates the expected results, and assigns them to the respective testbench signals. The test outcomes are displayed after each iteration, indicating pass or fail based on the comparison results. The module concludes operations after all tests with a call to '$finish'.
