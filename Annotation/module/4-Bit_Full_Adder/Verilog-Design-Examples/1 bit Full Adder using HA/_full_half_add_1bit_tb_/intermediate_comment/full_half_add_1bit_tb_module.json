    "module": "The 'full_half_add_1bit_tb' module is a testbench designed to verify the operation of a 1-bit full adder, generating random inputs and validating the logic by comparing computed results against actual device outputs. It implements an initial block that iterates through 100 test cases, employing a task (`stimulus`) to assign random binary values to inputs (`a`, `b`, `cin`) and calculate expected results, which are subsequently checked against the outputs (`sum`, `carry`) from the device under test."
