It tests whether the sum and carry outputs of a device under test (identified as 'dut') match the results calculated within testbench code after simulating many combinations of inputs. The test involves applying random binary values as inputs for the variables 'a', 'b', and 'cin', then comparing the resulting outputs from the design under test (the sum and carry) against expected values (new_sum and new_carry) calculated in the testbench. If both match, the test case passes; otherwise, it fails. The process repeats 100 times, and results are displayed for each case."

'sum' is the direct result of the addition, whereas 'carry' is the carry-out which might result from the addition if it exceeds the bit capacity of the operands (in this case, 1 bit).
