Module name: full_half_add_1bit. Module specification: The "full_half_add_1bit" module implements a 1-bit full adder using two instances of an internal "half_adder" to perform binary addition operations. It accepts three input ports: i_a and i_b, which are the two binary bits to be added, and i_cin, the carry-in bit necessary for cascading adders in multi-bit operations. The module provides two outputs: o_sum, which is the sum result of the addition, and o_carry, the carry-out bit useful for extending the addition to multiple bits. Internally, the module uses three signals: w_sum1, w_carry1, and w_carry2. w_sum1 is the intermediate sum from the first half adder (h1) computation of i_a and i_b; w_carry1 is the carry output from the same operation. The second half adder (h2) takes w_sum1 and i_cin as inputs to produce the final sum (o_sum) and an intermediate carry (w_carry2). The final carry-out (o_carry) is determined by the logical OR operation between w_carry1 and w_carry2. The code is primarily structured into two main blocks: instantiation of the two half adders (h1 and h2) and an assignment statement that computes the final carry-out. Each half adder performs an elementary bit-wise addition operation: summing through XOR and generating carry using AND operations.
