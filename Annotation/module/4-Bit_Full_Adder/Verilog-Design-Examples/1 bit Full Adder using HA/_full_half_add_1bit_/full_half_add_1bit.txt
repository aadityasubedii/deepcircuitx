The full_half_add_1bit module implements a 1-bit full adder utilizing two instances of a half_adder to compute the sum and carry-out for two input bits and a carry-in. It first calculates an intermediate sum and carry using the first half_adder, then uses these results with the carry-in in the second half_adder to produce the final sum and a new carry, which combine to create the module's final carry-out through a logical OR operation.
