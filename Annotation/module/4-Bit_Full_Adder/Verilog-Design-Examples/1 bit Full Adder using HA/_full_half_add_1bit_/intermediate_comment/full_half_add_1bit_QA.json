It takes three inputs, i_a, i_b, and i_cin, which represent two bits to be added and a carry-in bit, respectively. The module outputs two signals, o_sum and o_carry, representing the sum and the carry-out of the addition. Internally, it first adds i_a and i_b through one half_adder (h1), producing an intermediate sum (w_sum1) and carry (w_carry1). Then, another half_adder (h2) adds the intermediate sum (w_sum1) and the carry-in bit (i_cin) to produce the final sum (o_sum) and another intermediate carry (w_carry2). The final carry-out (o_carry) is determined by the logical OR of both intermediate carries (w_carry1 and w_carry2)."

The port i_cin represents the carry-in bit, which is added along with i_a and i_b to form a full-adder functionality. These inputs are necessary to allow the addition of two binary digits along with a carry from any previous addition.\n\nOutput ports: o_sum, o_carry. \nExplanation: The output port o_sum represents the sum result of the 1-bit addition of i_a, i_b, and i_cin. The o_carry is the output carry bit, which is the higher digit of the binary sum, necessary when cascading multiple full-adder modules to handle multi-bit binary addition."
