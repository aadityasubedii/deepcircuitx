Module name: full_add_4bit. Module specification: The `full_add_4bit` module performs a 4-bit addition of two numbers, `i_a` and `i_b`, considering an input carry `i_cin`. It outputs a 4-bit sum `o_sum` and a carry output `o_carry`. The input ports include `i_a[3:0]` and `i_b[3:0]`, both 4-bit vectors representing the numbers to be added, and `i_cin`, a single-bit input representing the carry-in. The output ports are `o_sum[3:0]` and `o_carry`, where `o_sum` is the resultant 4-bit sum, and `o_carry` is the carry-out. Internally, the module uses wires `w_carry1`, `w_carry2`, and `w_carry3` to pass the carry from one full bit addition to the next. The module contains four instances of `full_half_add_1bit` named `fa1`, `fa2`, `fa3`, and `fa4`. Each instance handles the addition for each bit of the input numbers: `fa1` processes the least significant bits, and `fa4` processes the most significant bits, where `fa4`'s carry-out becomes the module's `o_carry`. The chaining of these instances with intermediate carries ensures correct computation across all bit positions.
