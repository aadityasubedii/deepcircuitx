    "module": "The `full_add_4bit` module performs a 4-bit addition of two binary numbers along with a carry input, outputting the sum and a carry out. It leverages four instances of the `full_half_add_1bit` submodule, each responsible for individual bit additions from LSB to MSB, with intermediate carries passed between them using internal wires, ensuring accurate addition across all bit positions."
