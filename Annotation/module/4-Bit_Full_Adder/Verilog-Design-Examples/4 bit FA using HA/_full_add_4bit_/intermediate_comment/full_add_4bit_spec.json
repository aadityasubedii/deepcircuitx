    "spec": "Module name: full_add_4bit. Module specification: The `full_add_4bit` module performs a 4-bit addition of two numbers, `i_a` and `i_b`, considering an input carry `i_cin`. It outputs a 4-bit sum `o_sum` and a carry output `o_carry`. The input ports include `i_a[3:0]` and `i_b[3:0]`, both 4-bit vectors representing the numbers to be added, and `i_cin`, a single-bit input representing the carry-in. The output ports are `o_sum[3:0]` and `o_carry`, where `o_sum` is the resultant 4-bit sum, and `o_carry` is the carry-out. Internally, the module uses wires `w_carry1`, `w_carry2`, and `w_carry3` to pass the carry from one full bit addition to the next. The module contains four instances of `full_half_add_1bit` named `fa1`, `fa2`, `fa3`, and `fa4`. Each instance handles the addition for each bit of the input numbers: `fa1` processes the least significant bits, and `fa4` processes the most significant bits, where `fa4`'s carry-out becomes the module's `o_carry`. The chaining of these instances with intermediate carries ensures correct computation across all bit positions.",

            "content": "Name of the module and its functionality is as follows: \nModule name: full_add_4bit. \nExplanation: This module performs a 4-bit addition of two numbers. It takes as inputs two 4-bit numbers (`i_a` and `i_b`), along with a carry input (`i_cin`). It outputs a 4-bit sum (`o_sum`) and a carry output (`o_carry`). The module internally strings together four instances of a one-bit full adder (defined in the `full_half_add_1bit` module), where each full adder processes a single bit of the input numbers and the carry from the previous adder, to compute the sum and carry at each bit position.\n\nModule name: full_half_add_1bit.\nExplanation: This module performs a one-bit full addition, which is a common arithmetic operation combining two one-bit values and a carry-in to produce a one-bit sum and a carry-out. It uses two instances of the half-adder module (`half_adder`), first adding the input bits and then adding the result with the carry-in bit. The final sum is output along with a carry-out, which is the logical OR of the two intermediate carries generated by the half-adders.\n\nModule name: half_adder.\nExplanation: This module executes a one-bit addition with no carry input, simply known as half addition. It takes two one-bit inputs (`h_a` and `h_b`) and generates a sum (`h_sum`) and a carry (`h_carry`). The sum is calculated using the XOR operation between the two input bits, and the carry is calculated using the AND operation, reflecting the basic principles of binary arithmetic."

                    "text": "Module name: full_add_4bit. Module specification: The `full_add_4bit` module performs a 4-bit addition of two numbers, `i_a` and `i_b`, considering an input carry `i_cin`. It outputs a 4-bit sum `o_sum` and a carry output `o_carry`. The input ports include `i_a[3:0]` and `i_b[3:0]`, both 4-bit vectors representing the numbers to be added, and `i_cin`, a single-bit input representing the carry-in. The output ports are `o_sum[3:0]` and `o_carry`, where `o_sum` is the resultant 4-bit sum, and `o_carry` is the carry-out. Internally, the module uses wires `w_carry1`, `w_carry2`, and `w_carry3` to pass the carry from one full bit addition to the next. The module contains four instances of `full_half_add_1bit` named `fa1`, `fa2`, `fa3`, and `fa4`. Each instance handles the addition for each bit of the input numbers: `fa1` processes the least significant bits, and `fa4` processes the most significant bits, where `fa4`'s carry-out becomes the module's `o_carry`. The chaining of these instances with intermediate carries ensures correct computation across all bit positions."
