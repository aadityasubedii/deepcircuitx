Module name: full_add_4bit_tb.

Module specification: The `full_add_4bit_tb` module is a Verilog testbench designed for verifying the functionality of a 4-bit full adder (dut). The module includes inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin` which are 4-bit, 4-bit, and 1-bit, respectively, representing two binary numbers and a carry-in for addition. It outputs `sum`, a 4-bit result of the binary addition, and `carry`, a 1-bit output indicating an overflow from the most significant bit. Internal signals, `new_sum` and `new_carry`, are employed for independently computing the sum and carry within the testbench to verify the correctness of the `dut`. The code includes an instantiation of the full adder module `full_add_4bit`, and an `initial` block that executes a loop for 200 cycles, during each of which it calls the `stimulus` task. This task assigns random values to `a`, `b`, and `cin`, and calculates the expected `new_sum` and `new_carry`. After the delay, it checks and displays whether the test case passed or failed based on the match between `dut` outputs and the independently computed `new_sum` and `new_carry`. The testbench effectively validates the full adder by ensuring it operates as intended under various random test conditions.
