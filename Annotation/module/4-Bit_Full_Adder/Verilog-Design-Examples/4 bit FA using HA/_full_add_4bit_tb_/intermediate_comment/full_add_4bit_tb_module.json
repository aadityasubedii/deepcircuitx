    "module": "The `full_add_4bit_tb` module serves as a testbench for verifying a 4-bit full adder by applying random inputs and checking the outputs against independently computed results. It systematically tests the adder (`dut`) using a loop in an `initial` block that invokes a `stimulus` task to generate random input vectors and calculate expected results, comparing these with the module outputs to confirm correct functionality."
