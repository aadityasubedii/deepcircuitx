    "spec": "Module name: full_add_4bit_tb.\n\nModule specification: The `full_add_4bit_tb` module is a Verilog testbench designed for verifying the functionality of a 4-bit full adder (dut). The module includes inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin` which are 4-bit, 4-bit, and 1-bit, respectively, representing two binary numbers and a carry-in for addition. It outputs `sum`, a 4-bit result of the binary addition, and `carry`, a 1-bit output indicating an overflow from the most significant bit. Internal signals, `new_sum` and `new_carry`, are employed for independently computing the sum and carry within the testbench to verify the correctness of the `dut`. The code includes an instantiation of the full adder module `full_add_4bit`, and an `initial` block that executes a loop for 200 cycles, during each of which it calls the `stimulus` task. This task assigns random values to `a`, `b`, and `cin`, and calculates the expected `new_sum` and `new_carry`. After the delay, it checks and displays whether the test case passed or failed based on the match between `dut` outputs and the independently computed `new_sum` and `new_carry`. The testbench effectively validates the full adder by ensuring it operates as intended under various random test conditions.\n",

The testbench instantiates the full adder module (`dut`), and systematically applies random inputs (`a`, `b`, `cin`) to the full adder, summing these values both within the instantiated module and independently within the testbench (`new_sum` and `new_carry`). It then compares these results to validate that the full adder operates correctly under all generated test conditions, printing out messages to indicate whether each test case was passed or failed based on this comparison."

They represent the two binary numbers and the carry input that are added together by the full adder.\n\nOutput ports: `sum, carry`.\nExplanation: `sum` is a 4-bit output that represents the resultant sum of the binary addition of inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin`. `carry` is a 1-bit output that represents the carry-out resulting from the addition, indicating an overflow out of the 4-bit sum if it occurs.
