The testbench instantiates the full adder module (`dut`), and systematically applies random inputs (`a`, `b`, `cin`) to the full adder, summing these values both within the instantiated module and independently within the testbench (`new_sum` and `new_carry`). It then compares these results to validate that the full adder operates correctly under all generated test conditions, printing out messages to indicate whether each test case was passed or failed based on this comparison."

They represent the two binary numbers and the carry input that are added together by the full adder.\n\nOutput ports: `sum, carry`.\nExplanation: `sum` is a 4-bit output that represents the resultant sum of the binary addition of inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin`. `carry` is a 1-bit output that represents the carry-out resulting from the addition, indicating an overflow out of the 4-bit sum if it occurs. These outputs are used in the testbench to compare against independently calculated values to verify the correctness of the full adder logic."
