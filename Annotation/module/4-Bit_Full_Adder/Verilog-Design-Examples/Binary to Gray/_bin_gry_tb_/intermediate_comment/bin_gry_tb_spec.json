Module specification: The \"bin_gry_tb\" module serves as a comprehensive testbench for validating the binary to Gray code conversion logic encapsulated within a device under test (DUT), specifically the \"bin_gry\" module parameterized for 8 bits. It includes an input port, 'binary', which is an 8-bit register used to provide binary inputs to the DUT. The output, 'gray', is an 8-bit wire that represents the Gray code result computed by the DUT. Internally, the testbench utilizes a register 'new_gray' also of 8 bits, which is manually calculated within the testbench to form the expected Gray code output from a given binary input. This calculated output is then compared against the DUT's output to validate its correctness. The code features several blocks: (1) instantiation of the DUT with the specified parameters, (2) an `initial` block, where a `repeat` loop is used for generating multiple test cases by randomly assigning values to the 'binary' register and manually computing 'new_gray', and (3) a 'task' called 'stimulus' used for stimulus generation and manual Gray code computation. Each test run outputs a message indicating whether the DUT's output matches the manually computed 'new_gray', thus indicating pass or fail status of each test case.",
