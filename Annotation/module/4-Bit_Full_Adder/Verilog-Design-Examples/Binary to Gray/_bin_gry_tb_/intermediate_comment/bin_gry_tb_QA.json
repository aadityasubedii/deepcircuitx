It utilizes a device under test (DUT) from another module named \"bin_gry\" parameterized with N=8 bits. The testbench repeatedly generates random binary inputs, performs a manual binary-to-Gray code conversion, and then compares this manual conversion to the output from the DUT to verify correctness. It displays the result of each test case, indicating whether the test passed or failed based on the match between the manually computed Gray code and the DUT output."

This input simulates the typical input that the bin_gry module would receive in a real-world application.\n\nOutput ports: [gray].
