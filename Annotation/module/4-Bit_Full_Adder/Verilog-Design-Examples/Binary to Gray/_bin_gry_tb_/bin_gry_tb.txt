The bin_gry_tb module tests the binary to Gray code conversion logic of a DUT by generating random binary inputs, performing manual Gray code conversion, and comparing this result with the DUT output to validate accuracy. It automatically tests multiple cases using a loop, reports test results, and uses internal registers for manual computation and comparison with the DUT's output.
