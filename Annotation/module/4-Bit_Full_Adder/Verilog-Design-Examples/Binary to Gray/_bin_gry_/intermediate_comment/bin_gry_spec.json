    "spec": "Module name: bin_gry. Module specification: The 'bin_gry' module is a Verilog implementation designed to convert an N-bit binary number into its equivalent Gray code. The module takes an N-bit input 'binary' and outputs an N-bit 'gray' code. The most significant bit of the output 'gray' is directly taken from the most significant bit of the input 'binary'. Each of the remaining bits in the 'gray' output is computed using the XOR operation between two consecutive bits from the 'binary' input. The output is register-based, ensuring that the 'gray' value remains stable across clock cycles until a new input is provided. The module does not utilize any internal signals, making its operation straightforward with direct assignments and bitwise operations encapsulated in the always block, which triggers computation upon changes in the 'binary' input. This structure ensures efficient and direct conversion from binary code to Gray code without the need for additional signal processing.",
