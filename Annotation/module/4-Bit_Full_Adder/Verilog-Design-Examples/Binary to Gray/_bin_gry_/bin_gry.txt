The 'bin_gry' module converts an N-bit binary number to its corresponding Gray code by directly using the binary input. The most significant bit of Gray code is the same as that of the binary input, while the remaining bits are calculated through an XOR operation between consecutive bits of the binary input. The result is stored in a register-based output 'gray', which is updated on changes in 'binary'.
