Module name: mealy_ol. Module specification: The 'mealy_ol' module is a Verilog implementation of a Mealy state machine that responds to an input 'in' and changes its state and output based on this input and its current state, synchronized by a clock signal 'clk'. The module features three input ports: 'in', a binary input determining state transitions and output values; 'clk', a clock signal that triggers updates on rising edges; and 'reset', which initializes the state to S0 when high. The sole output port 'out' represents response based on the current state and 'in'. Internally, 'mealy_ol' employs two key signals: 'present_state', a register maintaining the current state, and 'next_state', a register computed during operation to identify the subsequent state post-transition. The Verilog code comprises two main always blocks: one sensitive to 'clk' and 'reset' that sets 'present_state' based on the value of 'next_state', and another sensitive to 'present_state' and 'in', which handles state transition logic and output setting through a case statement, efficiently managing outputs and state shifts according to inputs and current states.
