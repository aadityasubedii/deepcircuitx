    "module": "The 'mealy_ol' module implements a Mealy state machine that updates its state and output based on input 'in' and current state synchronized by 'clk'. The module uses two always blocks: one updates 'present_state' at clock edges or on 'reset', and another manages state transitions and 'out' output through a case statement, contingent on 'present_state' and 'in'."
