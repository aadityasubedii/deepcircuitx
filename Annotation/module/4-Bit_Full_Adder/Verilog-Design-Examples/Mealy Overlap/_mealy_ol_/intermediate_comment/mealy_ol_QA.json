Upon a positive clock edge or when reset is active, it updates the present state. If reset is high, the state resets to S0. The state transitions and output signals are determined by the combination of the current state and the value of 'in'. There are four states (S0, S1, S2, S3), each with specific transitions and outputs: in S0 and S1, the output is 0 and transitions depend on 'in'; in S2, the output remains 0 but transitions to S3 if 'in' is low; in S3, the output can be 0 or 1 depending on 'in', transitioning to S0 or S1. This can be used to generate specific output patterns or control signals based on the sequence of input states."

Transitions occur on the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- 'reset' is a binary input used to initialize the state machine. When 'reset' is high, the machine returns to the initial state (S0).\n\nOutput ports: out. \nExplanation: \n- 'out' is a binary output that represents the state machine's response based on the current state and the input 'in'.

It is updated at every rising edge of the clock or when the reset is triggered. The value of `present_state` determines the output `out` and the next state `next_state` based on the input `in`.\n  \n- `next_state`: This is a register that temporarily holds the next state the state machine should transition to, which is determined by the current `present_state` and the input `in`. It is calculated in the combinational logic block and then transferred to `present_state` at the next clock edge, ensuring that the state transitions are synchronous with the clock."
