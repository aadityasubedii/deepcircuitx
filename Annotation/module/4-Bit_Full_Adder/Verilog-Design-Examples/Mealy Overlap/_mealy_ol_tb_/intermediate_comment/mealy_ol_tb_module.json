    "module": "The 'mealy_ol_tb' module simulates a Mealy machine that detects sequences in binary input utilizing a testbench setup. It uses input ('in'), clock ('clk'), and reset ('reset') signals to process state transitions and output generation, managed through procedural blocks for stimulus application, state transition, and output verification. This setup ensures thorough testing of sequence detection capabilities by comparing expected and actual outputs based on the machine's state logic."
