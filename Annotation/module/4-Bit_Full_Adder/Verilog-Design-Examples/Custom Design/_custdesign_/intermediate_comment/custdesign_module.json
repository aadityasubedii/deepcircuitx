    "module": "The 'custdesign' module processes a digital input 'x' alongside a clock 'clk' and reset 'reset', outputting 'y' based on internal sequential logic. It utilizes two Set-Reset Flip-Flops (srff), with the first generating signals 'a' and 'abar' that influence the reset (r2) and set (s2) controls of the second flip-flop. The output 'y' combines the second flip-flop's output with the reset condition, encapsulating a feedback mechanism essential for state-based calculations or control logic."
