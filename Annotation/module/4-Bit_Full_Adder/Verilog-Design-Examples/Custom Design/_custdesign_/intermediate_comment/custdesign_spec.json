    "spec": "Module name: custdesign. \nModule specification: The 'custdesign' module is designed as a digital logic circuit utilizing sequential logic components to process an input signal 'x', along with a clock signal 'clk' and a reset signal 'reset', and produce an output 'y'. The input signal 'x' influences the sequential and combinational logic within the module, while 'clk' is crucial for updating internal states at each positive clock edge. The 'reset' input ensures the module's flip-flops are reset to a known state during specific conditions. Internally, the module utilizes a set of signals: 'a' and 'abar' (outputs of the first flip-flop and their complements), 'b' and 'bbar' (outputs from the second flip-flop and their complements), 'r2' (a reset control for the second flip-flop derived by XORing 'a' and 'x'), and 's2' (the set control for the second flip-flop, obtained by inverting 'r2'). The module is composed of two main sections: the first flip-flop ('srff sr1') that generates 'a' and 'abar', influencing subsequent logic processes, and the second flip-flop ('srff sr2'), which utilizes 's2' and 'r2' derived from the first section to manage 'b' and 'bbar'. Finally, the output 'y' is computed by combining the output of the second flip-flop ('b') with 'r2'. This arrangement of flip-flops and logic gates forms a feedback system, likely facilitating stateful signal processing or control mechanisms in larger digital systems.",

Internally, it uses two instances of a sub-module named 'srff', which is a Set-Reset Flip-Flop, to handle sequential logic based on the conditions of the inputs and previously stored states.
