    "module": "The \"custdesign_tb\" module serves as a testbench for the \"custdesign\" module, simulating a set of input conditions to evaluate its response. It generates a clock signal with a 10-time unit period and manipulates control signals (`x`, `reset`, and `b`), starting with all signals initialized and reset released after 20 time units. The output `y` is monitored to observe responses under various test conditions, concluding the simulation after 200 time units. Additional internal signals are declared but not utilized in the visible implementation, suggesting potential internal testing pathways or placeholders within \"custdesign\"."
