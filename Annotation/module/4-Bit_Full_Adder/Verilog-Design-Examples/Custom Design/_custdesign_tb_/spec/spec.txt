Module name: custdesign_tb. 
Module specification: The "custdesign_tb" is a Verilog testbench designed to test the "custdesign" module. It primarily handles the simulation of input signals including a clock signal (`clk`), a reset signal (`reset`), and a data/control signal (`x`). The testbench includes a clock generator that toggles the clock every 5 time units, achieving a clock period of 10 time units. It initializes the input signal `b` to 1, sets `x` to 1, and controls the `reset` signal by setting it high initially, then low after 20 time units, with the entire simulation concluding after 200 time units. The output from `custdesign` is monitored through the wire `y`. Internal signals within the module — `a`, `abar`, `b`, `bbar`, `r2`, and `s2` — are declared, but their specific purposes are not outlined within the provided code snippet, suggesting their roles could be tied to further logic processing inside the `custdesign` module or could be placeholders. Thus, the testbench manages signal generation for testing and monitors the responsive behavior of the `custdesign` module under these test conditions.
