    "module": "The `moore_ol_tb` module simulates a Moore machine for detecting the sequence \"1101\", outputting '1' upon detection and '0' otherwise. It includes inputs (`in`, `clk`, `reset`) and an output (`out`). Sequential logic in `always` blocks manages state transitions based on inputs, and a task (`stimulus`) generates random test inputs, all synchronized by the clock. Internal signals (`new_out`, `ps`, `ns`) facilitate state tracking and output validation."
