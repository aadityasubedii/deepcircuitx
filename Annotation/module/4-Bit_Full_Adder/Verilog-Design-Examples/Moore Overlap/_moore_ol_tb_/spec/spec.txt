Module name: moore_ol_tb. Module specification: The `moore_ol_tb` module simulates a Moore machine specialized in detecting the binary sequence "1101". This module features input ports including `in` (binary input feeding sequence into the state machine), `clk` (clock signal to synchronize operations), and `reset` (signal to asynchronously reset the state machine to initial state S0). The module outputs through the `out` port which indicates detection of the sequence with a '1'. Internal signals such as `new_out` (internal register for output validation), `ps` (present state register holding current state), and `ns` (next state register guiding state transitions based on input and current state) are crucial for the machineâ€™s operation. The Verilog code is structured into several blocks: an initial block setting initial conditions for `clk` and `reset`, a task named `stimulus` generating random input to the sequence detector, and sequential `always` blocks handling state transitions and output computations based on the state. Each block contributes collectively to testing the sequence detection functionality and validating output through simulated conditions.
