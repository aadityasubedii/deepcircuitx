Module name: moore_ol. Module specification: The 'moore_ol' module is a Verilog implementation of a Moore finite state machine (FSM) that processes input signals through five defined states (S0, S1, S2, S3, S4) to produce an output based on the current state. Each state transition is influenced by the input ports - 'in', 'clk', and 'reset'. The 'in' input determines transitions between states, 'clk' synchronizes state transitions to its positive edge, and 'reset' asynchronously resets the FSM to the initial state (S0) upon a positive edge. The output port 'out' manifests the FSM's state, emitting '0' in states S0 to S3, and '1' when in S4. Internally, the 'present_state' register maintains current FSM state, while 'next_state' holds the computed subsequent state to which the FSM might transition. The module contains two primary always blocks: one handling the state update based on the clock and reset signals, and another managing state transitions and output assignments based on inputs and current state logic. This design firmly positions the module as suitable for sequence detection or control tasks within digital systems requiring precise state-driven logic.
