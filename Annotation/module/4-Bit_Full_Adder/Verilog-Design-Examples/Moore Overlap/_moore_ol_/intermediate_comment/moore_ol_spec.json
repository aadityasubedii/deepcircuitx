    "spec": "Module name: moore_ol. Module specification: The 'moore_ol' module is a Verilog implementation of a Moore finite state machine (FSM) that processes input signals through five defined states (S0, S1, S2, S3, S4) to produce an output based on the current state. Each state transition is influenced by the input ports - 'in', 'clk', and 'reset'. The 'in' input determines transitions between states, 'clk' synchronizes state transitions to its positive edge, and 'reset' asynchronously resets the FSM to the initial state (S0) upon a positive edge. The output port 'out' manifests the FSM's state, emitting '0' in states S0 to S3, and '1' when in S4. Internally, the 'present_state' register maintains current FSM state, while 'next_state' holds the computed subsequent state to which the FSM might transition. The module contains two primary always blocks: one handling the state update based on the clock and reset signals, and another managing state transitions and output assignments based on inputs and current state logic. This design firmly positions the module as suitable for sequence detection or control tasks within digital systems requiring precise state-driven logic.",

The FSM has five states (S0, S1, S2, S3, and S4), and its transitions are based on the input 'in'. The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state of the FSM. The state transitions and corresponding outputs are:\n- From S0: if 'in' is high, it transitions to S1; if low, it remains in S0. The output is 0.\n- From S1: if 'in' is high, it transitions to S2; if low, it goes back to S0. The output is 0.\n- From S2: if 'in' is high, it stays in S2; if low, it transitions to S3. The output is 0.\n- From S3: if 'in' is high, it transitions to S4; if low, it returns to S0. The output is 0.\n- From S4: if 'in' is high, it moves back to S2; if low, it goes to S0. The output is 1.\nThe FSM uses asynchronous reset, where on the positive edge of 'reset', the state is set to S0. The state is updated on the positive edge of the clock 'clk'. Based on its transition logic, the FSM primarily serves as a sequential detector or controller based on the 'in' signal."
