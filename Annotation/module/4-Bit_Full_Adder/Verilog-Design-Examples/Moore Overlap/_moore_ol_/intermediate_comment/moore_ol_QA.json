The FSM has five states (S0, S1, S2, S3, and S4), and its transitions are based on the input 'in'. The output 'out' is determined solely by the current state of the FSM. The state transitions and corresponding outputs are:\n- From S0: if 'in' is high, it transitions to S1; if low, it remains in S0. The output is 0.\n- From S1: if 'in' is high, it transitions to S2; if low, it goes back to S0. The output is 0.\n- From S2: if 'in' is high, it stays in S2; if low, it transitions to S3. The output is 0.\n- From S3: if 'in' is high, it transitions to S4; if low, it returns to S0. The output is 0.\n- From S4: if 'in' is high, it moves back to S2; if low, it goes to S0. The output is 1.\nThe FSM uses asynchronous reset, where on the positive edge of 'reset', the state is set to S0. The state is updated on the positive edge of the clock 'clk'. Based on its transition logic, the FSM primarily serves as a sequential detector or controller based on the 'in' signal."

The transitions between states are triggered based on whether this signal is high or low.\n- `clk`: The clock signal, which is essential for synchronizing the state transitions of the FSM. The next state is updated at the positive edge of this clock signal.\n- `reset`: This is the asynchronous reset signal. Whenever this signal is high (at the positive edge), the FSM state is reset to the initial state, S0, irrespective of the current state.\n\nOutput ports: `out`.\nExplanation: \n- `out`: This is the output of the FSM, determined solely by the current state. It remains 0 for states S0, S1, S2, and S3. For state S4, the output is set to 1.

This state is what is actively being outputted and altered based on transitions.\n- `next_state`: This register is used to compute and hold the state that the FSM should transition to at the next clock cycle.
