    "module": "The 'moore_ol' module implements a Moore finite state machine (FSM) with five states to control an output based on input sequences. It uses input 'in' for state transitions, 'clk' to synchronize updates, and 'reset' for asynchronous initialization. State behavior and transitions are managed within two always blocks, handling both the state updates on clock and reset signals and the state transition logic based on current states and inputs, making it suitable for sequence detection and control."
