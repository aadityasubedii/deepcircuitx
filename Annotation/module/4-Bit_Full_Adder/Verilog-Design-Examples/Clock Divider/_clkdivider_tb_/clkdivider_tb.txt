The 'clkdivider_tb' module tests the functionality of a clock divider by simulating clock and reset signals and verifying the output clock ('out_clk') against expected behavior. It operates with initial setups for signal states, a 'stimulus' task that manages clock toggling and invokes a 'verify' task to compare 'new_clk', synchronized by 'clk_count', against 'out_clk', thus ensuring the clkdivider module's correctness through automated test cases and result displays.
