Module name: clkdivider_tb. 
Module specification: The 'clkdivider_tb' is a Verilog testbench module designed for validating the clock division functionality of an underlying 'clkdivider' device under test (DUT). It primarily uses input ports: 'clk' (a clock signal toggled in the 'stimulus' task for simulating real-time clock behavior) and 'reset' (which initializes the DUT to a known state by being set briefly at the beginning of the simulation). The sole output port 'out_clk' outputs the clock from the DUT, used in verification to ensure correct functionality of the clock division by comparing it against expected results. The module utilizes internal signals: 'new_clk', a register for a local clock signal that toggles based on the 'clk_count' value, and 'clk_count', a 2-bit register keeping track of clock cycles for synchronization purposes. The code is structured into initial blocks that set the initial states of signals, a 'stimulus' task that continuously toggles the 'clk' and calls the 'verify' task for verifying the output, and a 'verify' task which checks synchronization of 'new_clk' with 'out_clk' and displays test results based on these verifications. This modular approach ensures effective testing and verification of the clkdivider functionality.
