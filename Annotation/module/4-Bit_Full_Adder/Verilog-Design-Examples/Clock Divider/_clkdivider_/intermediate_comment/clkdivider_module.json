    "module": "The 'clkdivider' module acts as a clock frequency divider, halving the frequency of the input clock 'clk'. It utilizes an internal 2-bit register 'clk_count' that increments on each positive edge of 'clk' unless 'reset' is high, which resets both 'clk_count' and the output 'out_clk'. The MSB of 'clk_count' determines the state of 'out_clk', effectively dividing the input clock frequency by two."
