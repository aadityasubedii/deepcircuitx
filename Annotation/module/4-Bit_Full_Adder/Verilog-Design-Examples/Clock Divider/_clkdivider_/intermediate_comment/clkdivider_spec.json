    "spec": "Module name: clkdivider. \n\nModule specification: The 'clkdivider' module is designed as a clock frequency divider that outputs a clock signal ('out_clk') at half the frequency of the input clock signal ('clk') when the 'reset' input is low. The input ports include 'reset', which is used to reset the internal counter and output signal, and 'clk', which is the input clock whose frequency is to be divided. The output port 'out_clk' oscillates at half the frequency of 'clk' under non-reset conditions. Internally, a 2-bit register 'clk_count' is employed to track the clock cycles of 'clk'. It increments with every positive edge of 'clk' if 'reset' is not asserted. The most significant bit (MSB) of 'clk_count' is then used to toggle 'out_clk', achieving the frequency division. The code is structured around an 'always' block that triggers on the positive edge of 'clk'. This block checks the 'reset' signal; if high, it resets 'clk_count' and 'out_clk' to 0. If 'reset' is low, it increments 'clk_count' and updates 'out_clk' with the value of the MSB of 'clk_count', effectively halving the frequency of the input clock signal. This design allows the 'clkdivider' module to function effectively as a frequency divider by 2.",
