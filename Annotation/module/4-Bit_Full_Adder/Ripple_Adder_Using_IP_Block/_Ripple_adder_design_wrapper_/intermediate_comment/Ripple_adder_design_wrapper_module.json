    "module": "The Ripple_adder_design_wrapper module implements a 4-bit ripple carry adder, managing the addition of two 4-bit binary inputs A and B, along with an input carry Cin, and it delivers a 4-bit sum and a carry-out. Internally, it forwards I/O connections to an instantiated Ripple_adder_design where actual addition operations occur, distributing summation bits and carry output through dedicated wires connected directly to internal module ports."
