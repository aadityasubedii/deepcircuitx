Module name: Ripple_adder_design_wrapper. 
Module specification: The "Ripple_adder_design_wrapper" is a Verilog module that encapsulates a 4-bit ripple carry adder. This module processes two 4-bit input vectors, labeled A and B, and a single-bit input carry, Cin. It outputs a 4-bit sum distributed across four output bits (s0 to s3) and a carry-out bit (Cout). The inputs, A and B, are binary numbers, while Cin is used for cascaded additions, transferring carry from previous calculations. Cout outputs the final carry generated by the most significant bit addition. The outputs s0 to s3 each represent one bit of the sum starting from the least significant bit. Internally, this module uses wires for each input and output, forwarding these directly to an instance of "Ripple_adder_design", which performs the actual addition. The internal instantiation of Ripple_adder_design_i connects these input and output wires appropriately to the respective ports of the internal Ripple_adder_design module, thereby managing the addition. This structured setup within the Ripple_adder_design_wrapper ensures it efficiently handles 4-bit additions with carry propagation, suitable for complex digital arithmetic operations.
