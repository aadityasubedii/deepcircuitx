    "module": "The Full_Adder module calculates the sum (S) and carry-out (Co) of three input bits: A, B, and Cin, which are used to implement binary addition. It achieves this by directly assigning the sum S through XOR operations among A, B, and Cin, and calculating the carry-out Co using a combination of AND and XOR operations on the inputs, reflecting typical operations of a simple combinational logic circuit for a full adder."
