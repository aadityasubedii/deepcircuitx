It outputs two bits: S (sum) and Co (carry output). The sum (S) is calculated using the XOR operation on inputs A, B, and Cin, representing the bitwise sum without considering carries. The carry output (Co) is calculated using a combination of AND and XOR operations, to determine if a carry is generated by any pair of input bits or propagated from the lower significant bits."

It is computed as the exclusive OR (XOR) of inputs A, B, and Cin. This output represents the bit result of the addition of A, B, and the carry-in Cin, disregarding further carry propagation.\n- Co is the carry output of the full adder. It is derived from the conditions where a carry would be generated from the addition of A and B or propagated from Cin. This output indicates whether there is a carry bit that needs to be considered in the next higher significant bit addition."

The operations for S and Co are performed inline without the use of additional internal signals for intermediary storage or processing. This methodology is typical for simple combinational logic designs like a full adder where immediate results can be derived from the inputs without the need for additional signal manipulation."
