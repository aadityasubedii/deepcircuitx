    "spec": "Module name: Full_Adder. Module specification: The Full_Adder module is designed to perform binary addition on three input bits, A, B, and Cin (carry input), producing a sum bit (S) and a carry output bit (Co). The input A and B represent the primary binary addends, while Cin is the carry from a previous addition, aiding in multi-bit binary addition tasks. The sum output S is computed using an XOR operation among A, B, and Cin, reflecting the bitwise summation. The carry output Co is derived via a combination of AND and XOR operations; it provides the carry that may need to be added to the next most significant bit. The module leverages direct assignment operations for S and Co outputs without utilizing any internal signals, making the design concise and efficient. The logical operations are encoded directly in the output assignments within the module, emphasizing its straightforward, combinational logic nature. This arrangement facilitates a clear understanding and easy tracing of how the input signals are processed to produce the outputs.",
