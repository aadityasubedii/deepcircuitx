Module name: tb. Module specification: The "tb" module is designed as a testbench to verify the functionality of a 4-bit ripple carry adder encapsulated within the `Ripple_adder_design_wrapper`. The module operates by systematically generating and applying a series of test vectors to the ripple carry adder. The input ports include a 4-bit `A` and a 4-bit `B` used for providing binary numbers, and a single-bit `Cin` (carry-in), initially set to 0, essential for simulating addition operations. The output ports comprise `Cout` (carry-out) and the sum bits `s0`, `s1`, `s2`, `s3`, with `Cout` indicating any overflow from the most significant bit which is useful for chaining adders, and the sum bits representing the individual outputs from the least significant to the most significant bit positions. Internally, the module utilizes an integer `i` for iterating through test vectors, where `A` is incrementally set from 0 to 15 and `B` is randomly generated. The test sequence occurs within an `initial` block, reflecting a loop structure that applies inputs to the ripple carry adder at intervals of 5 nanoseconds. This design ensures comprehensive testing of the adderâ€™s response under varied input conditions, affirming its operational correctness through sequential test cycles.
