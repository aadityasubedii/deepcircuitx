    "module": "The \"tb\" module functions as a testbench for validating a 4-bit ripple carry adder by generating sequential and random test vectors for the inputs. It uses the `Ripple_adder_design_wrapper` module to perform addition on 4-bit inputs `A` and `B`, where `A` cycles through values 0 to 15 and `B` is randomly assigned within the same range, employing a carry-in `Cin` initially set to 0. Outputs, including carry-out `Cout` and sum bits `s0`, `s1`, `s2`, `s3`, are evaluated every 5 ns to ensure the adder's correctness under different scenarios."
