    "spec": "Module name: tb. Module specification: The \"tb\" module is designed as a testbench to verify the functionality of a 4-bit ripple carry adder encapsulated within the `Ripple_adder_design_wrapper`. The module operates by systematically generating and applying a series of test vectors to the ripple carry adder. The input ports include a 4-bit `A` and a 4-bit `B` used for providing binary numbers, and a single-bit `Cin` (carry-in), initially set to 0, essential for simulating addition operations. The output ports comprise `Cout` (carry-out) and the sum bits `s0`, `s1`, `s2`, `s3`, with `Cout` indicating any overflow from the most significant bit which is useful for chaining adders, and the sum bits representing the individual outputs from the least significant to the most significant bit positions. Internally, the module utilizes an integer `i` for iterating through test vectors, where `A` is incrementally set from 0 to 15 and `B` is randomly generated. The test sequence occurs within an `initial` block, reflecting a loop structure that applies inputs to the ripple carry adder at intervals of 5 nanoseconds. This design ensures comprehensive testing of the adder\u2019s response under varied input conditions, affirming its operational correctness through sequential test cycles.",

The purpose of this testbench is to verify the functionality of the ripple carry adder by applying different test vectors. The test vectors are generated within a loop, where input A is incrementally cycled from 0 to 15, and input B is randomly generated during each iteration of the loop. It applies these inputs to the ripple carry adder every 5 nanoseconds and observes the outputs `Cout`, `s0`, `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` which likely represent the carry out and sum bits of the adder, respectively.
