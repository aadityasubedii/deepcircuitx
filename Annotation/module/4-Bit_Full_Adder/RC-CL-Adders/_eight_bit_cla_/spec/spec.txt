Module name: eight_bit_cla. 
Module specification: The 'eight_bit_cla' module is an 8-bit carry lookahead adder designed to effectively perform the addition of two 8-bit binary numbers, A and B, along with an initial carry input C0. It outputs the sum as an 8-bit number S and provides a carry output C8 for potential use in subsequent addition stages. The input ports include two 8-bit numbers, A and B, and a carry input C0, where A and B are the numbers being added and C0 acts as an initial carry. The outputs are S, the result of the addition, and C8, the final carry out after the most significant bit addition.

Internally, the module uses 'G' (Generate) and 'P' (Propagate) signals as intermediate 8-bit signals, where G is generated by AND operation of A and B indicating carry generation and P is or-treated on A and B indicating carry propagation. There are also seven carry interconnects (C1 to C7) generated sequentially from the least significant bit to the most significant bit, depending on the generate and propagate conditions of all preceding bits along with the initial or propagated carry.

In the code block, the generate (G) and propagate (P) signals are assigned first. Subsequently, carries C1 through C7 are derived from G, P, and the initial or previous carry. The final carry output C8 is then calculated from the most significant bit's G, P, and previous carry. Each bit of the sum (S) is computed using the exclusive OR operation among the corresponding bits of A, B, and the appropriate carry. This method facilitates the module to provide a rapid summation of the inputs, leveraging a parallel approach to determine each bit of the result, hence eliminating the delay characteristically associated with the traditional ripple-carry adders.
