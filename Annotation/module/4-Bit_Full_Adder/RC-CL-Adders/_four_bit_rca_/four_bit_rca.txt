The `four_bit_rca` module performs a four-bit binary addition of inputs `A` and `B` with an input carry `Cin`, producing a sum `S` and a carry-out `Cout`. It uses four instances of the `full_adder` module connected in a cascading fashion where carry is propagated from the least significant to the most significant bit through internal wires `C1`, `C2`, and `C3`, implementing a ripple-carry mechanism.
