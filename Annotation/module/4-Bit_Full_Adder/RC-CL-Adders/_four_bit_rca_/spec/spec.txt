Module name: four_bit_rca. Module specification: The `four_bit_rca` module implements a four-bit ripple carry adder, which is designed to perform binary addition on two four-bit numbers. It comprises of four full adder blocks represented by instances `f0` to `f3`. The module accepts two 4-bit input vectors, `A[3:0]` and `B[3:0]`, which represent the numbers to be added, and a single bit carry input `Cin`. It outputs a 4-bit vector `S[3:0]` representing the sum of inputs `A` and `B`, along with the carry `Cin`. The `Cout` output is the carry out of the most significant bit, which can be used for chaining in larger adder configurations. Internally, the module uses three single-bit signals `C1`, `C2`, and `C3` to propagate the carry from one stage of addition to the next, ensuring accurate sum and carry outputs for each bit. `C1` is the carry out from the least significant bit addition (f0), feeding into the second bit addition (f1), `C2` carries forward to the third bit addition (f2), and `C3` advances to the most significant bit addition (f3). Each `full_adder` instance computes both the sum and carry-out for its specific bit level, contributing to the cascading effect essential for the ripple carry mechanism in binary addition.
