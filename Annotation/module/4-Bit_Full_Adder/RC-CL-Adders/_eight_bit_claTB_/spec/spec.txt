Module name: eight_bit_claTB. Module specification: The eight_bit_claTB module serves as a test bench for validating the functionality of an 8-bit carry look-ahead adder, specifically the 'eight_bit_cla' module. This test bench exercises the adder by driving the 8-bit input registers 'a' and 'b' with identical values ranging from 0 to 128, and toggling the 1-bit input 'cin' (carry-in) between 0 and 1 every other iteration to simulate different carry-in conditions. The outputs of the adder are 'sum', an 8-bit wire holding the result of the addition, and 'cout', a 1-bit wire indicating the carry-out. Internally, the test bench utilizes an 8-bit register 'invect', functioning as a loop counter that generates the input values for 'a' and 'b', and assists in toggling 'cin'. The 'initial begin' block named 'apply_stimulus' initializes 'cin' to 0, iterates 'invect' from 0 to 128, alternates 'cin' every second iteration, assigns test values to 'a' and 'b', and introduces a delay of 5 nanoseconds between each test case, ensuring sufficient time for observing the outputs. This structured approach facilitates the verification of both the basic addition and the carry propagation logic of the eight_bit_cla adder under various test scenarios.
