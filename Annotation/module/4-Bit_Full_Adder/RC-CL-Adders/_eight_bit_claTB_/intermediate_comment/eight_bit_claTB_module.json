    "module": "The eight_bit_claTB module is a test bench for testing the eight_bit_cla carry look-ahead adder by driving identical sequential values from 0 to 128 on inputs 'a' and 'b', and toggling the carry input 'cin' every second iteration to validate the adder's sum ('sum') and carry-out ('cout') outputs. The test runs employ a 5 ns delay between iterations to allow time for output observation, using an internal loop counter 'invect' to manage input settings and 'cin' toggling."
