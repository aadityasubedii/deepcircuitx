    "module": "The eight_bit_rcaTB module is a testbench for verifying an 8-bit ripple carry adder by systematically testing addition operations of 8-bit number pairs `a` and `b` along with a carry-in `cin`. It cycles through values from 0 to 128 for both inputs, toggles `cin` on odd iterations, and passes the values to the adder module, checking the 8-bit sum and carry-out results after each test case with a designated simulation delay.\n"
