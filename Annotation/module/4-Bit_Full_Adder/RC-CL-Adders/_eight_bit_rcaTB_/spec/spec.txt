Module name: eight_bit_rcaTB. Module specification: The `eight_bit_rcaTB` is a Verilog testbench module designed to validate the functionality of an 8-bit ripple carry adder represented by another module (`eight_bit_rca`). It handles this by simulating the addition of two 8-bit numbers `a` and `b`, along with a carry-in input `cin`. The module includes three input ports: `a` and `b` are 8-bit registers holding the binary numbers to be added, and `cin` is a single-bit register managing the carry-in for the addition. The outputs are an 8-bit wire `sum` that outputs the result of the addition, and a single-bit wire `cout` that indicates the carry-out or overflow from the most significant bit. Internally, the testbench operates through a procedural block labeled `apply_stimulus` which iterates the input variables `a` and `b` from 0 to 128, toggles the `cin` every odd iteration, and checks the resultant `sum` and `cout` after a delay of 5 time units. This process ensures comprehensive testing over various combinations of inputs and helps in verifying the correct function of the ripple carry adder module under differently timed input conditions.
