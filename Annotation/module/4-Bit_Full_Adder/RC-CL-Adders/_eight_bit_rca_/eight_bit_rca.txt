The eight_bit_rca module implements an 8-bit ripple carry adder using two 4-bit ripple carry adders (instances of four_bit_rca). It accepts two 8-bit vectors, A and B, plus a carry-in Cin, and outputs an 8-bit sum S and a carry-out Cout. The lower 4 bits of A and B are added by the first adder instance, producing an intermediary carry (C1), which is then used as the carry-in for the second adder instance that processes the upper 4 bits, completing the 8-bit addition.
