    "spec": "Module name: eight_bit_rca. Module specification: The eight_bit_rca module is an 8-bit ripple carry adder designed using Verilog. It combines two instances of a 4-bit ripple carry adder (four_bit_rca) to process 8-bit inputs. The module accepts two 8-bit vectors, `A` and `B`, for addition along with a single-bit carry input `Cin`. It outputs an 8-bit sum `S` and a carry-out `Cout`. Internally, the module utilizes a single wire `C1`, which acts as the carry output from the addition of the lower four bits of `A` and `B` (processed by the first four_bit_rca instance) and serves as the carry input for the addition of the upper four bits (processed by the second four_bit_rca instance). This hierarchical use of smaller adders helps in efficiently calculating the 8-bit sum and carry output, ensuring correct propagation of carries between the lower and upper halves. The setup includes one `four_bit_rca` instance labeled `f0` for the lower four bits and another instance `f1` for the upper four bits. This structuring ensures precise and organized handling of byte-level operations within digital systems, bolstering multi-byte arithmetic operability.",

The module takes two 8-bit inputs, `A` and `B`, and a carry input `Cin`. It outputs an 8-bit sum `S` and a carry output `Cout`.
