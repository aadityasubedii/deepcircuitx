Module name: four_bit_cla. Module specification: The four_bit_cla module implements a four-bit carry look-ahead adder (CLA) that computes the sum of two four-bit numbers, A and B, while considering an initial carry input C0. This module outputs a four-bit sum S and a final carry-out C4. The input ports include A and B, which are the four-bit numbers to be added, and C0, serving as the carry-in for the Least Significant Bit (LSB) addition. The output ports consist of S, the resultant four-bit sum, and C4, the carry-out after the Most Significant Bit (MSB) addition. Internally, the module uses signals G and P for generate and propagate functions, determining carry generation and propagation through bits, respectively. The intermediate carry bits C1, C2, and C3 facilitate efficient computation between successive bit levels. The code structure comprises multiple assign statements defining logic for the G and P signals based on inputs A and B, the calculation of intermediate carries (C1 to C3), the final carry-out (C4), and the resultant sum bits (S[0] to S[3]). This structured approach in the four_bit_cla module helps in minimizing the delay by efficiently calculating carry bits using the look-ahead technique.
