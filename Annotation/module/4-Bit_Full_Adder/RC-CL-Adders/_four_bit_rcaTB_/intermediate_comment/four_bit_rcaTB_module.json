    "module": "The four_bit_rcaTB module is a testbench for verifying a 4-bit ripple carry adder, testing all possible single-digit inputs along with carry-in variations. It systematically simulates addition operations by incrementing internal register 'invect' from 0 to 8, using it to assign values to inputs 'a' and 'b', and toggles 'cin' when 'invect' equals 4, employing a delay after each setup to observe outputs 'sum' and 'cout' for correct functionality."
