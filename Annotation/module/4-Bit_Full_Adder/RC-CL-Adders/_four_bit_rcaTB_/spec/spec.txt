Module name: four_bit_rcaTB. Module specification: The "four_bit_rcaTB" is a Verilog testbench module specially designed to verify the functionality of a 4-bit ripple carry adder, referred to within as "four_bit_rca." It utilizes two 4-bit input registers 'a' and 'b', and a single-bit carry-in input 'cin'. These inputs are methodically manipulated to test all possible input combinations through a controlled loop mechanism. Outputs of the module are a 4-bit wire 'sum', reflecting the binary sum, and a single-bit wire 'cout', representing the carry-out generated by the adder. An internal 4-bit register 'invect' drives the sequence of the test simulations, sweeping from 0 to 8. It auto-assigns its value to both 'a' and 'b', while also toggling 'cin' from 0 to 1 once 'invect' equals 4, thereby testing both the carry propagation and basic addition functionality. The testbench initializes and drives the inputs to the 'four_bit_rca' instance, simulating conditions at every step with a time delay to enable the evaluation of the adderâ€™s response to various combinations of input values.
