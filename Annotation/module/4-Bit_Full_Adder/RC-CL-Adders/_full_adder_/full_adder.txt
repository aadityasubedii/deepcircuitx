The full_adder module performs binary addition on three single-bit inputs: A, B, and Cin, to produce two outputs: S (sum) and Cout (carry-out). S is calculated using an XOR operation on all three inputs, providing the resultant addition bit, while Cout is determined by checking if any two inputs are high using combined AND and OR operations, indicating a carry to the next significant bit in broader addition calculations.
