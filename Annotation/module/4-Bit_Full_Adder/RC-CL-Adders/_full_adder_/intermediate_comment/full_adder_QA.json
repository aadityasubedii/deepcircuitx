It outputs two results: S (sum) and Cout (carry-out). The sum output, S, is calculated by performing the exclusive OR (XOR) operation on the three inputs A, B, and Cin. This determines the resultant bit of the addition. The carry-out, Cout, is determined by checking if any two of the three input bits are high (1), which is achieved using AND and OR operations. This output signifies whether there is a carry generated that needs to be added to the next higher bit in multi-bit addition scenarios."
