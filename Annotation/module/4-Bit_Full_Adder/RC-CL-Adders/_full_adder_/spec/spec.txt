Module name: full_adder. Module specification: The 'full_adder' module is specifically designed to execute binary addition on three single-bit inputs, A, B, and Cin, which are the two numbers to be added and the carry-in, respectively. It delivers two single-bit outputs: S, the sum of the inputs, and Cout, the carry-out. The sum S is computed via the XOR operation on inputs A, B, and Cin, indicating the bit result of the addition. The carry-out Cout is derived by evaluating if any two of the inputs are high using AND and OR operations, which signals if there is an additional carry to be managed in higher bit operations of multi-bit addition environments. The module employs no internal signals; all operations are managed directly through calculations on the given input ports. The code distinctly outlines two main expressions assigned to S and Cout respectively, each reflecting the necessary logical operations to determine their outcomes directly from the inputs.
