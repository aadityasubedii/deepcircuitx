It takes two 4-bit numbers (Num_1 and Num_2) and a carry input (C_in) as inputs, and produces a 4-bit sum (Out) and a carry output (C_out). The addition includes the carry-in, and the result is represented as a 5-bit number 'sum', where the fifth bit is used as the carry-out. The carry-out (C_out) is the most significant bit of the sum, and the remaining lower four bits form the output sum (Out). This module essentially functions as a basic arithmetic unit for adding binary numbers with provision for carry propagation."

It contains the least significant four bits of the overall resultant sum.\n- C_out is a single-bit output carrying the most significant bit of the complete sum which acts as the carry-out. This is especially useful if this module is part of a larger addition operation, enabling carry propagation to the next higher order bits."
