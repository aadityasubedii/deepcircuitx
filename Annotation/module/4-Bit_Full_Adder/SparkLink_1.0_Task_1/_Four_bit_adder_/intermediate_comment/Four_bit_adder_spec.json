    "spec": "Module name: Four_bit_adder. Module specification: The 'Four_bit_adder' is a Verilog module designed to execute 4-bit addition. It processes two 4-bit numbers, 'Num_1' and 'Num_2', and a carry input 'C_in', computing their sum and producing both a 4-bit output sum 'Out' and a carry output 'C_out'. The module's input ports include 'Num_1' and 'Num_2', both 4-bit wires attending to the binary numbers needing addition, and 'C_in', a single-bit wire representing the carry input from potentially preceding addition stages. Outputs comprise 'Out', a 4-bit sum of the inputs excluding the carry-out, and 'C_out', a single-bit output housing the most significant bit from the addition result, serving as a carry-out. Internally, a single signal 'sum', a 5-bit wire, captures the overall sum including the carry input, from which 'C_out' and 'Out' are subsequently derived. The module primarily operates through assignments where 'sum' is calculated directly from 'Num_1', 'Num_2', and 'C_in; 'C_out' is extracted as the highest bit from 'sum'; and 'Out' takes the lower four bits. This structure ensures clarity in propagation and assignment, marking the modularity of operation in digital arithmetic within hardware designs.",

It contains the least significant four bits of the overall resultant sum.\n- C_out is a single-bit output carrying the most significant bit of the complete sum which acts as the carry-out.
