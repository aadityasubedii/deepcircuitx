Module name: Four_bit_adder. Module specification: The 'Four_bit_adder' is a Verilog module designed to execute 4-bit addition. It processes two 4-bit numbers, 'Num_1' and 'Num_2', and a carry input 'C_in', computing their sum and producing both a 4-bit output sum 'Out' and a carry output 'C_out'. The module's input ports include 'Num_1' and 'Num_2', both 4-bit wires attending to the binary numbers needing addition, and 'C_in', a single-bit wire representing the carry input from potentially preceding addition stages. Outputs comprise 'Out', a 4-bit sum of the inputs excluding the carry-out, and 'C_out', a single-bit output housing the most significant bit from the addition result, serving as a carry-out. Internally, a single signal 'sum', a 5-bit wire, captures the overall sum including the carry input, from which 'C_out' and 'Out' are subsequently derived. The module primarily operates through assignments where 'sum' is calculated directly from 'Num_1', 'Num_2', and 'C_in; 'C_out' is extracted as the highest bit from 'sum'; and 'Out' takes the lower four bits. This structure ensures clarity in propagation and assignment, marking the modularity of operation in digital arithmetic within hardware designs.
