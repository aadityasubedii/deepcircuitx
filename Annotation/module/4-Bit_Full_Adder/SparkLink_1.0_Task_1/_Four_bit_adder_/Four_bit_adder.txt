The Four_bit_adder module performs a 4-bit addition of two binary numbers 'Num_1' and 'Num_2', along with a carry input 'C_in', outputting a 4-bit sum 'Out' and a carry-out 'C_out'. It utilizes a 5-bit internal signal 'sum' to compute the total sum including the carry input, which is then split to assign 'Out' as the lower four bits and 'C_out' as the highest bit of 'sum', effectively managing both the result and carry propagation for chained additions.
