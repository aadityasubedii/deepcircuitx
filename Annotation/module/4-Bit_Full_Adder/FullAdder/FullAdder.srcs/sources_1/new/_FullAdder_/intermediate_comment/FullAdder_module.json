    "module": "The FullAdder module performs the addition of three single-bit inputs (x, y, cin) to produce a sum and a carry-out. It calculates the sum using a bitwise XOR operation on all inputs, while the carry-out is determined by an OR operation between an AND of x and y, and an AND of the XOR of x and y with cin. This direct combinational logic approach ensures efficient adder functionality without intermediate signals."
