    "spec": "Module name: FullAdder. Module specification: The FullAdder module is engineered to perform the arithmetic operation of addition on three single-bit binary inputs, specifically designed for situations requiring the summing of bits along with carry-in support, typical within multi-bit binary adders. It accepts three input ports: 'x' and 'y', which represent the primary single-bit operands for the addition; and 'cin', which is the carry-in bit from the previous addition stage, crucial for chained full adder deployments in larger bit-width additions. The module features two outputs: 'sum', which computes the bitwise XOR of x, y, and cin, indicating the result of the addition; and 'cout' (carry-out), which signifies if there was a carry from the addition, computed through a combination of AND and OR operations applied on the inputs. The FullAdder does not use any internal signals and directly derives the outputs using combinational logic implemented in the Verilog code. This straightforward approach using bitwise operations within the 'assign' statements efficiently accomplishes the full adder functionality without intermediary computation stages.",

The module generates two outputs: sum and cout. The `sum` output is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between x, y, and cin, representing the sum of the values. The `cout` (carry-out) is determined by checking if at least two of the three input bits are high, which is implemented using a combination of AND and OR operations.
