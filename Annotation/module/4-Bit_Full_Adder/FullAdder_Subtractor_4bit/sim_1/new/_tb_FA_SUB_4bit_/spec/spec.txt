Module name: tb_FA_SUB_4bit. 

Module specification: The `tb_FA_SUB_4bit` module acts as a testbench for testing the functionality of another module likely named `FA_SUB_4bit`. It systematically verifies whether this connected module correctly computes addition or subtraction based on given 4-bit input values. The module utilizes input ports `i_A` (4-bit), `i_B` (4-bit), and `i_mode` (1-bit) for input operands and the operation mode, respectively. `i_A` and `i_B` serve as two numeric operands, where their operational behavior (addition or subtraction) is dictated by `i_mode` (`0` for addition, `1` for subtraction). The outputs are presented through the output ports `o_sum` (4-bit) and `o_carry` (1-bit), where `o_sum` represents the computational result and `o_carry` indicates an overflow or borrow condition. Internally, the testbench assigns various combinations of values to `i_A`, `i_B`, and `i_mode` at different times to cover multiple operational scenarios, checking the correctness of the outcomes. The instantiations connect these ports to the module under test, `FA_SUB_4bit` (dut), allowing the propagation of signals between the testbench and the module. The `initial begin` block in the code places sequential stimuli with specific delay intervals to simulate real-time input changes and records the module responses to assess functionality, culminating the simulation with a `$finish` command after all test cases.
