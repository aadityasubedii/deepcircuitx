    "spec": "Module name: tb_FA_SUB_4bit. \n\nModule specification: The `tb_FA_SUB_4bit` module acts as a testbench for testing the functionality of another module likely named `FA_SUB_4bit`. It systematically verifies whether this connected module correctly computes addition or subtraction based on given 4-bit input values. The module utilizes input ports `i_A` (4-bit), `i_B` (4-bit), and `i_mode` (1-bit) for input operands and the operation mode, respectively. `i_A` and `i_B` serve as two numeric operands, where their operational behavior (addition or subtraction) is dictated by `i_mode` (`0` for addition, `1` for subtraction). The outputs are presented through the output ports `o_sum` (4-bit) and `o_carry` (1-bit), where `o_sum` represents the computational result and `o_carry` indicates an overflow or borrow condition. Internally, the testbench assigns various combinations of values to `i_A`, `i_B`, and `i_mode` at different times to cover multiple operational scenarios, checking the correctness of the outcomes. The instantiations connect these ports to the module under test, `FA_SUB_4bit` (dut), allowing the propagation of signals between the testbench and the module. The `initial begin` block in the code places sequential stimuli with specific delay intervals to simulate real-time input changes and records the module responses to assess functionality, culminating the simulation with a `$finish` command after all test cases.",

It's one of the primary numbers on which arithmetic operations (addition or subtraction) are performed based on the mode.\n\n- `i_B`: Similar to `i_A`, this is also a 4-bit register used as the second input operand in arithmetic operations within the FA_SUB_4bit module.\n\n- `i_mode`: This single-bit register determines the operation mode of the FA_SUB_4bit module.
