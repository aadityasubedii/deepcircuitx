    "module": "The `tb_FA_SUB_4bit` module serves as a testbench to validate the `FA_SUB_4bit` module, ensuring accurate arithmetic operations (addition or subtraction) based on input values. It tests the module by stimulating `i_A` and `i_B` (4-bit input operands) and `i_mode` (operation mode selector), and observes `o_sum` and `o_carry` outputs for correct results under various conditions. Properties are set and tested sequentially with predefined delays to simulate real operational timing, verifying outputs using an instantiation of `FA_SUB_4bit`."
