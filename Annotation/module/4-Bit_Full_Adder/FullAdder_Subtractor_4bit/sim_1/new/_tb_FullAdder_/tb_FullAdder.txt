The tb_FullAdder module serves as a testbench for verifying the functionality of a FullAdder circuit, testing all combinations of binary inputs and their respective carry operation. Inputs i_A, i_B, and i_Cin are systematically varied, with a `#10` delay to simulate each possible input scenario, resulting in outputs o_sum and o_carry mapped directly to the FullAdder module instantiated as 'dut'. The test sequence concludes with a `$finish` to terminate the simulation after all test cases are executed.
