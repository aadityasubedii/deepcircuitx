Module name: tb_FullAdder. Module specification: The module tb_FullAdder is designed as a testbench to validate the functionality of a FullAdder circuit. It simulates the addition of binary digits using input ports i_A and i_B, along with i_Cin, which serves as the carry-in bit from previous addition operations. The outputs of the module, o_sum and o_carry, respectively represent the resultant sum and the carry-out from the addition, which may act as a carry-in for a subsequent addition stage in larger operations. This module doesn't utilize internal signals aside from the defined inputs and outputs, which directly interact with the instantiated FullAdder module named 'dut'. Within the code, there's an 'initial' block designed to systematically simulate the test conditions by altering the inputs in sequences with a procedural delay (`#10`), thereby covering all possible states for the inputs. After executing and verifying all scenarios, the simulation concludes with a `$finish` command.
