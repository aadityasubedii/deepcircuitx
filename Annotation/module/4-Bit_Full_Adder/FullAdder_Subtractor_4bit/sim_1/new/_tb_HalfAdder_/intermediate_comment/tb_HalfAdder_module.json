    "module": "The 'tb_HalfAdder' module serves as a testbench for verifying the functionality of a Half Adder circuit, ensuring it correctly performs single-bit binary addition. It tests all possible input combinations through internal registers 'i_A' and 'i_B', which drive the inputs of an instantiated Half Adder module (dut). Outputs 'o_sum' and 'o_carry' are monitored for correctness against expected outcomes. Input scenarios are applied sequentially with a 10 ns delay, validating each case before the simulation concludes with '$finish'."
