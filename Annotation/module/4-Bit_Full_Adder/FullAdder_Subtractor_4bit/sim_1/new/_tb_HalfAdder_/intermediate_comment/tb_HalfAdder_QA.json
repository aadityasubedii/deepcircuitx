The testbench sets up different pairs of binary input values for the inputs i_A and i_B of the Half Adder. It then observes the output signals o_sum (sum output) and o_carry (carry output) to ensure the Half Adder performs as expected. The input pairs tested are '00', '01', '10', and '11', which covers all possible combinations for a Half Adder. The testbench is iteratively applying each set of inputs with a delay of 10ns between each application before finishing the simulation."
