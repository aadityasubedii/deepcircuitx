Module name: tb_HalfAdder.
Module specification: The 'tb_HalfAdder' is a testbench module designed explicitly for verifying the functionality of a Half Adder circuit, which is crucial for ensuring accurate single-bit binary addition. The module uses two input ports, 'i_A' and 'i_B', where each port accepts a binary value (0 or 1) to represent the digits being added. These inputs are classified as internal register signals within the module, ensuring they can be manipulated to test various input scenarios. It outputs the results through two output ports, 'o_sum' and 'o_carry', connected as internal wire signals deriving their values from the Half Adder (dut) outputs. 'o_sum' conveys the addition result, whereas 'o_carry' indicates if there's a carry-out when both input bits are high. The testbench structure includes an instantiation of the Half Adder module (dut) with appropriate port mapping and an initial block. The initial block applies input combinations '00', '01', '10', and '11' sequentially with a 10 ns delay between each to verify the correct functionality of the Half Adder through observation of the outputs for each input set. The simulation concludes with a '$finish' command after all test cases are applied. This thorough setup within the tb_HalfAdder module ensures that every possible binary addition scenario is checked, thereby confirming the reliable operations of the Half Adder logic.
