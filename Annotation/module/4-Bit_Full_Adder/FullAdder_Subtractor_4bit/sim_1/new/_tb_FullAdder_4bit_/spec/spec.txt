Module name: tb_FullAdder_4bit. 
Module specification: The tb_FullAdder_4bit serves as a testbench for validating the functionality of a 4-bit full adder, specifically designed to test the addition of two 4-bit numbers along with a carry in a device under test (DUT), named 'fourbit_4bit_Adder'. The input ports include 'i_A' and 'i_B', both 4-bit registers to hold the binary numbers being added, and 'i_Cin', a single-bit register hardwired to zero to represent the carry-in which is not used in this setup. The outputs consist of a 4-bit wire 'o_sum' capturing the resultant sum, and a single-bit wire 'o_carry' indicating overflow in case the result exceeds the 4-bit size. The testbench triggers initialization by setting up various test cases to simulate different additions at specific times, verifying if the DUT outputs match expected conditions for given inputs. This process initiates with setting both input numbers to zero and increments through diverse binary combinations, followed by termination of the simulation.
