The tb_FullAdder_4bit module functions as a testbench to verify the operation of a 4-bit full adder by testing the addition of various 4-bit binary inputs, ensuring correct summation and carry-out handling. It employs a DUT instance of fourbit_4bit_Adder, initializing sequential test inputs for 'i_A' and 'i_B' with predefined values and observing outputs 'o_sum' and 'o_carry' for validation. The tests progress through a series of predetermined binary combinations using timing delays to simulate different scenarios, concluding with a simulation termination command.
