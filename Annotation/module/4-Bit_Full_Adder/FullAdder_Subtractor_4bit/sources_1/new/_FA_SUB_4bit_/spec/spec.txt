Module name: FA_SUB_4bit. Module specification: The `FA_SUB_4bit` module is designed to perform addition or subtraction on two 4-bit binary numbers, depending on the operation mode specified by the input. The inputs to the module include `i_A` and `i_B`, which are the 4-bit binary numbers to be processed, and `i_mode`, a single-bit input that determines the operation mode (0 for addition and 1 for subtraction). The outputs are `o_sum`, a 4-bit output representing the result (sum or difference), and `o_carry`, a single-bit output indicating the carry-out from the arithmetic operation. Internally, the module utilizes a signal `w_i_B`, which is a bitwise XOR of `i_B` with the repeated bits of `i_mode`; this effectively inverts `i_B` when `i_mode` is set for subtraction. Another internal signal, `w_carry`, is declared but not used in the logic. The main block of logic includes the instantiation of a submodule named `fourbit_4bit_Adder`, which calculates the sum or difference using `i_A`, modified `i_B` (`w_i_B`), and `i_mode` as the carry-in input. The design simplifies handling both addition and subtraction by using a common hardware structure, promoting resource optimization in hardware applications.
