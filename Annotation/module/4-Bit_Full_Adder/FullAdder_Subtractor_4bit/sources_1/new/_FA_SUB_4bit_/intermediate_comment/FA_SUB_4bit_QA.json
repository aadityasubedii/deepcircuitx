If the `i_mode` is set, it effectively turns the operation into subtraction by XOR-ing each bit of input `i_B` with the mode. A `fourbit_4bit_Adder` submodule is used to calculate the sum and carry-out, using the modified `i_B` (which is either inverted or passed straight through based on the mode), `i_A`, and the mode as the carry-in. This allows the module to utilize the same hardware (4-bit adder) for both addition and subtraction operations."

The signal `w_i_B` is a 4-bit wire that holds the value of input `i_B` after being XOR-ed with the `i_mode`. This transformation effectively inverts the bits of `i_B` when subtraction is intended (i.e., when `i_mode` is high), and passes them unchanged when addition is intended (i.e., when `i_mode` is low). This modification of `i_B` is crucial for leveraging the `fourbit_4bit_Adder` for performing both addition and subtraction operations using the same hardware configuration."
