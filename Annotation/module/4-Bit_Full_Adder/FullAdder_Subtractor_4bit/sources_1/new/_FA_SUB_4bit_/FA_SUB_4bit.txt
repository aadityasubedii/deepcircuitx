The FA_SUB_4bit module performs addition or subtraction on two 4-bit inputs based on a mode input. It modifies the second input, i_B, with a bitwise XOR operation with the mode to handle both operations using a single adder submodule, fourbit_4bit_Adder, which takes the modified i_B, i_A, and i_mode as carry-in to output the result and carry-out.
