    "module": "The fourbit_4bit_Adder module performs binary addition of two 4-bit numbers and a carry-in, delivering a 4-bit sum and a carry-out. It utilizes four instantiated FullAdder sub-modules, each handling one bit of the numbers and sequential carry propagation through intermediate wire arrays, ensuring accurate addition across bits from least to most significant."
