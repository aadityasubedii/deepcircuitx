    "spec": "Module name: fourbit_4bit_Adder. Module specification: The fourbit_4bit_Adder is a Verilog module designed to perform the addition of two four-bit binary numbers, as well as handle a carry-in from a previous computational stage. The module inputs, [i_A, i_B, i_Cin], consist of two 4-bit inputs, i_A and i_B, which represent the binary numbers to be added, and a single-bit input, i_Cin, used for the carry-in from the lower significant stage. The outputs, [o_sum, o_carry], include a 4-bit output, o_sum, which delivers the sum of i_A and i_B incorporating the input carry, and a single-bit output, o_carry, which conveys the carry-out of the addition, usable in cascaded arithmetic operations or as an overflow indicator. Internally, the module uses an array of three single-bit wires, w_carry[2:0], which serves as intermediate carriers between each stage of the addition, facilitating the carry propagation from the least to the most significant bit. The module incorporates four instances of a FullAdder sub-module, with each instance responsible for adding corresponding bits of i_A and i_B along with the relevant carry input, and producing the respective bit of o_sum and the next stage carry. Collectively, the module and its sub-modules provide a clear, sequential handling of bit-level addition and carry propagation ensuring accurate multi-bit binary addition.",

It takes two four-bit binary numbers (i_A and i_B) and an input carry (i_Cin) and produces a four-bit sum (o_sum) and an output carry (o_carry). The addition is performed by cascading four instances of a FullAdder module, each processing one bit of the operands. The carry generated by each bit's addition is passed to the next significant bit. The final carry out from the most significant bit's addition is provided as the output carry (o_carry).
