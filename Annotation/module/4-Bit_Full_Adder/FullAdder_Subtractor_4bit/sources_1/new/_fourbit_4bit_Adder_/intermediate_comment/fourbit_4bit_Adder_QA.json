It takes two four-bit binary numbers (i_A and i_B) and an input carry (i_Cin) and produces a four-bit sum (o_sum) and an output carry (o_carry). The addition is performed by cascading four instances of a FullAdder module, each processing one bit of the operands. The carry generated by each bit's addition is passed to the next significant bit. The final carry out from the most significant bit's addition is provided as the output carry (o_carry). This module effectively adds two binary numbers and considers any carry input from previous computations."
