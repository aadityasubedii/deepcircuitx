Module name: fourbit_4bit_Adder. Module specification: The fourbit_4bit_Adder is a Verilog module designed to perform the addition of two four-bit binary numbers, as well as handle a carry-in from a previous computational stage. The module inputs, [i_A, i_B, i_Cin], consist of two 4-bit inputs, i_A and i_B, which represent the binary numbers to be added, and a single-bit input, i_Cin, used for the carry-in from the lower significant stage. The outputs, [o_sum, o_carry], include a 4-bit output, o_sum, which delivers the sum of i_A and i_B incorporating the input carry, and a single-bit output, o_carry, which conveys the carry-out of the addition, usable in cascaded arithmetic operations or as an overflow indicator. Internally, the module uses an array of three single-bit wires, w_carry[2:0], which serves as intermediate carriers between each stage of the addition, facilitating the carry propagation from the least to the most significant bit. The module incorporates four instances of a FullAdder sub-module, with each instance responsible for adding corresponding bits of i_A and i_B along with the relevant carry input, and producing the respective bit of o_sum and the next stage carry. Collectively, the module and its sub-modules provide a clear, sequential handling of bit-level addition and carry propagation ensuring accurate multi-bit binary addition.
