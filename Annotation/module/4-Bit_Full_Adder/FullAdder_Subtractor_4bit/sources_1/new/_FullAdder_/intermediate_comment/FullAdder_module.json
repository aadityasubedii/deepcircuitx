    "module": "The FullAdder module performs binary addition of two input bits and a carry-in bit, outputting the resultant sum and carry-out. It implements its functionality using two instantiated HalfAdder sub-modules; the first adds the input bits, and the second adds the result to the carry-in, while the final carry-out is determined by logically OR'ing the intermediate carry outputs from both HalfAdders."
