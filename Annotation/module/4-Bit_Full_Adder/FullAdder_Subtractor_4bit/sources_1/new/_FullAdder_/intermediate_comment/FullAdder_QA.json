It outputs two signals, o_sum and o_carry, where o_sum is the sum of the inputs and o_carry is the carry-out. The module uses two instances of a sub-module named HalfAdder to compute these values. The first HalfAdder computes a partial sum and carry using inputs i_A and i_B. The second HalfAdder then takes this partial sum and the carry-in (i_Cin) to produce the final sum and another carry, which along with the carry from the first HalfAdder, determine the final carry-out through a logical OR operation. This configuration effectively makes up a full adder logic circuit in digital electronics which is used for binary addition."
