    "spec": "Module name: FullAdder. Module specification: The FullAdder module is designed for binary addition of two single-bit inputs along with a carry-in, primarily used in digital electronics for constructing arithmetic units. It takes three input ports: i_A and i_B, which are the binary digits to be added, and i_Cin, the carry input from a previous addition stage. The module produces two outputs: o_sum, which is the sum of i_A, i_B, and i_Cin, and o_carry, the carry output that may be used as the carry input for the next higher bit in multi-bit addition configurations. Within the module, three internal signals, w_sum0, w_carry0, and w_carry1, are used. The w_sum0 signal holds the intermediary sum of i_A and i_B, produced by the first HalfAdder instance (HA0). The w_carry0 is the carry output from this first HalfAdder, and w_carry1 is the carry output from a second HalfAdder (HA1) that further adds w_sum0 with i_Cin to generate the final sum (o_sum). The final carry output (o_carry) is determined by the logical OR of w_carry0 and w_carry1. This composition effectively integrates two instances of HalfAdder sub-modules and demonstrates the use of internal wiring and basic logical operations to achieve full-adder functionality.",

It outputs two signals, o_sum and o_carry, where o_sum is the sum of the inputs and o_carry is the carry-out. The module uses two instances of a sub-module named HalfAdder to compute these values. The first HalfAdder computes a partial sum and carry using inputs i_A and i_B. The second HalfAdder then takes this partial sum and the carry-in (i_Cin) to produce the final sum and another carry, which along with the carry from the first HalfAdder, determine the final carry-out through a logical OR operation.
