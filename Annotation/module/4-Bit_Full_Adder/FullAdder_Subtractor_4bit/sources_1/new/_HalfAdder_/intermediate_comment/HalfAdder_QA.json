It has two input ports, i_A and i_B, representing the two binary digits to be added. The module produces two outputs, o_sum and o_carry. The o_sum output is the result of the XOR operation between i_A and i_B, representing the sum of the addition. The o_carry output is the result of the AND operation between i_A and i_B, representing the carry bit from the addition, which is used when the adder is part of a larger arithmetic operation."

Specifically, `o_sum` is generated by the XOR operation between `i_A` and `i_B`, and `o_carry` is generated by the AND operation between the same inputs.
