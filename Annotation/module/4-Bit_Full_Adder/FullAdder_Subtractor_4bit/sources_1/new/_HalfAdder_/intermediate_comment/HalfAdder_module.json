    "module": "The HalfAdder module performs the addition of two single-bit binary numbers. It features two input ports, i_A and i_B, and two output ports, o_sum and o_carry. The o_sum is calculated as the XOR of i_A and i_B for the sum result, and o_carry is determined by the AND of the same inputs, indicating the carry bit necessary for multi-bit addition operations. This direct implementation using simple logical operations ensures efficient processing."
