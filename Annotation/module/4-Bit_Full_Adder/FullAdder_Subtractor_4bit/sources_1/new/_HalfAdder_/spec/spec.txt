Module name: HalfAdder. Module specification: The HalfAdder module is designed to perform a basic arithmetic operation which is the addition of two single-bit binary numbers. It encompasses two input ports: `i_A` and `i_B`, where each represents a binary digit to be added. The module generates two output ports: `o_sum` and `o_carry`. The `o_sum` output is derived from the XOR operation between the two input ports `i_A` and `i_B`, providing the sum of the addition. On the other hand, the `o_carry` output results from the AND operation between the same input ports and represents the carry bit, which is essential for chained addition operations in more extensive arithmetic systems. Internally, the module does not utilize any additional signals or registers; it directly computes the outputs using simple logical assignments. The Verilog code clearly delineates these operations with the use of `assign` statements for both outputs, making the code straightforward and efficient to execute.
