    "module": "The AddSub module performs either addition or subtraction on two 4-bit inputs (x and y) controlled by a single-bit Select signal. It uses XOR gates to conditionally invert y bits based on Select, and chains four Full_Adder blocks to compute the result bit-by-bit with proper carry propagation, outputting both the 4-bit result and an overflow indication."
