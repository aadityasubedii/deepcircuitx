    "spec": "Module name: AddSub. \nModule specification: The `AddSub` module is designed to perform arithmetic operations \u2013 addition or subtraction \u2013 on two 4-bit numbers based on a control signal. It accepts `x` and `y` as 4-bit inputs representing the numbers to be processed, and `Select`, a single-bit input that determines the operation: `0` for addition and `1` for subtraction. The module outputs a 4-bit `Result` which represents the sum or difference of `x` and `y`, and a single-bit `Cout` which indicates an overflow or borrow out from the most significant bit operation. Internally, the module uses intermediate signals `z`, `z1`, `z2`, `z3` to hold the results of XOR operations between each bit of `y` and the `Select` signal, effectively selecting between `y` and its bitwise complement based on the operation required. Internal carry signals `C0`, `C1`, and `C2` are generated by three instances of `Full_Adder` modules (`u1`, `u2`, `u3`) to propagate carry/borrow from less significant to more significant bits. Each Full_Adder instance contributes to a part of the final result by computing a single bit of the result and the carry out using its inputs and a carry in from the previous stage. The last stage `u4` computes the most significant bit of the result and the final carry-out or borrow-out (`Cout`). This structure ensures coherent and correct arithmetic operations over multi-bit numbers based on the operation specified by the `Select` input.",
