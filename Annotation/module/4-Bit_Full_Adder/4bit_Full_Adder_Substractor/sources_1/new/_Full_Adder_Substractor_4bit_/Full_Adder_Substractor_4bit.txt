The Full_Adder_Substractor_4bit module performs 4-bit addition or subtraction on inputs i_A and i_B, controlled by i_Mode. If i_Mode is 1, it subtracts i_B from i_A, otherwise it adds them. It achieves this by XOR-ing i_B with i_Mode extended to 4-bits, creating w_Mode_B, and processes bits through cascaded FullAdder instances, each handling a bit slice of the operation and passing the carry or borrow to the next. The result and final carry/borrow are output as o_Sum and o_Cout respectively.
