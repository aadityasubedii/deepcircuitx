If `i_Mode` is logic high (1), the module subtracts input `i_B` from `i_A`, and if `i_Mode` is logic low (0), it adds `i_A` and `i_B`. It achieves this by XOR-ing `i_B` with `i_Mode` expanded to a 4-bit mask, effectively conditionally inverting `i_B` based on the mode. The module contains four instances of a FullAdder component connected in sequence, each responsible for processing one bit of the input operands and passing a carry output to the next stage. The final carry output is presented as `o_Cout`."
