    "spec": "Module name: Full_Adder_Substractor_4bit. \nModule specification: The Full_Adder_Substractor_4bit module is designed to perform either a 4-bit addition or a 4-bit subtraction between two input operands, i_A and i_B, based on the mode input i_Mode. When i_Mode is high (1), the module computes i_A - i_B; when low (0), it computes i_A + i_B. It handles this dual functionality by XOR-ing i_B with i_Mode expanded to a 4-bit value, generating the signal w_Mode_B, which conditionally inverts i_B for subtraction. The module consists of four cascaded FullAdder instances (FA0, FA1, FA2, FA3), each processing a separate bit of the operands and passing the carry/borrow output to the next. The primary input ports are: i_A and i_B, both 4-bit wide representing the operands, and i_Mode, a single bit determining the operation mode. The outputs are o_Sum, a 4-bit result of the arithmetic operation, and o_Cout, the carry/borrow output from the last adder stage, indicating an overflow or carry-out condition. Internal intermediate carry signals, w_Cout_0, w_Cout_1, and w_Cout_2, serve to connect the carry outputs and inputs of sequential FullAdder components. Each FullAdder instance receives a specific bit from i_A, the corresponding bit from w_Mode_B, and a carry input from the previous stage (or i_Mode for FA0), and outputs a sum bit and a carry/borrow bit to the next stage or as the final output.",
