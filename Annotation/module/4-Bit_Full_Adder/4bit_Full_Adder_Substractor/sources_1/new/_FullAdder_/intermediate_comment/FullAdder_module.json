    "module": "The FullAdder module performs a 1-bit addition of three input bits (i_A, i_B, i_Cin) using two HalfAdder modules to output a sum (o_Sum) and a carry-out (o_Cout). The first HalfAdder processes i_A and i_B to generate an intermediate sum and carry, while the second adds this intermediate sum to i_Cin, outputting the final sum and a second intermediate carry; o_Cout is derived by XORing these two carries."
