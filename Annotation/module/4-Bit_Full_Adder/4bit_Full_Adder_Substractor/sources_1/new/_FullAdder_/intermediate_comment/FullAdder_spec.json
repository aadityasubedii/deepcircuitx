    "spec": "Module name: FullAdder.  \nModule specification: The FullAdder module encapsulates the design of a 1-bit full adder in Verilog, utilizing two instances of a subordinate HalfAdder module to perform binary addition. It takes three 1-bit inputs: i_A and i_B (the two bits to be added), and i_Cin (carry-in from a previous addition), producing a 1-bit sum (o_Sum) and a carry-out (o_Cout). The internal operation is split across two HalfAdder modules; the first one, HA0, processes inputs i_A and i_B, yielding an intermediate sum stored in wire w_sum_0 and an intermediate carry in w_carry_0. The second HalfAdder, HA1, takes this intermediate sum and the input carry i_Cin to result in the final sum output o_Sum, and a second intermediate carry stored in w_carry_1. The final carry-out, o_Cout, is determined by XORing both intermediate carries (w_carry_0 and w_carry_1). This approach modularly breaks down the full addition operation into simpler half-addition steps, optimizing readability and maintainability of the code.",
