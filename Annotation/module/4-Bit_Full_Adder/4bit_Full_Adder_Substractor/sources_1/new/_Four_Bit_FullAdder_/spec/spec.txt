Module name: Four_Bit_FullAdder. Module specification: The Four_Bit_FullAdder module is designed to perform four-bit binary addition, incorporating a ripple carry configuration for accurate arithmetic operations. It accepts two four-bit inputs, i_A and i_B, representing the binary numbers to be added, and an additional single-bit input, i_Cin, for the input carry. The module outputs a four-bit sum (o_Sum) and a single-bit carry out (o_Cout). Internally, the module uses three wire signals: w_Cout_0, w_Cout_1, and w_Cout_2, each carrying the carry-out from one single-bit full adder to the carry-in of the next, providing necessary carry propagation. The module comprises four instantiations of a FullAdder module, each handling a single bit of the inputs and the propagated carry. The first instantiation (FA0) receives i_Cin as its carry-in and provides its carry-out to the next full adder (FA1), and this chain continues until FA3, where its carry-out forms the module's output carry (o_Cout). This architectural choice ensures the sequential processing of each bit addition along with the associated carry to produce the final results accurately.
