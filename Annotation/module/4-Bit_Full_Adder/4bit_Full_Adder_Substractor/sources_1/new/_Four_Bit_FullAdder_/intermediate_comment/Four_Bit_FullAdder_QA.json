The result of this addition is a four-bit sum (o_Sum) and an output carry (o_Cout). The module achieves this by instantiating and chaining four single-bit full adders (modules named FA0, FA1, FA2, FA3), where each full adder handles one bit of the operands. The carry-out of each full adder is fed as the carry-in to the next significant full adder, thus effectively creating a ripple carry adder configuration for a four-bit addition."
