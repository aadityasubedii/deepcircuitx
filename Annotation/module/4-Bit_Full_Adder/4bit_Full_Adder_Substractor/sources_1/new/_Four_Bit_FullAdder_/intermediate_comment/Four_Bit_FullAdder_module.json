    "module": "The Four_Bit_FullAdder module performs four-bit binary addition using a ripple carry approach. It receives two four-bit numbers (i_A, i_B) and a carry-in (i_Cin), outputting a four-bit sum (o_Sum) and a carry-out (o_Cout). The addition is executed through four cascaded FullAdder instances (FA0 to FA3) that handle each bit and pass carries sequentially from the least to the most significant bit to ensure correct summation."
