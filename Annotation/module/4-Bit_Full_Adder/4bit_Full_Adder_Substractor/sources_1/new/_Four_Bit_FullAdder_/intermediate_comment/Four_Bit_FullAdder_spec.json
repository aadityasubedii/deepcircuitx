    "spec": "Module name: Four_Bit_FullAdder. Module specification: The Four_Bit_FullAdder module is designed to perform four-bit binary addition, incorporating a ripple carry configuration for accurate arithmetic operations. It accepts two four-bit inputs, i_A and i_B, representing the binary numbers to be added, and an additional single-bit input, i_Cin, for the input carry. The module outputs a four-bit sum (o_Sum) and a single-bit carry out (o_Cout). Internally, the module uses three wire signals: w_Cout_0, w_Cout_1, and w_Cout_2, each carrying the carry-out from one single-bit full adder to the carry-in of the next, providing necessary carry propagation. The module comprises four instantiations of a FullAdder module, each handling a single bit of the inputs and the propagated carry. The first instantiation (FA0) receives i_Cin as its carry-in and provides its carry-out to the next full adder (FA1), and this chain continues until FA3, where its carry-out forms the module's output carry (o_Cout). This architectural choice ensures the sequential processing of each bit addition along with the associated carry to produce the final results accurately.",

The result of this addition is a four-bit sum (o_Sum) and an output carry (o_Cout). The module achieves this by instantiating and chaining four single-bit full adders (modules named FA0, FA1, FA2, FA3), where each full adder handles one bit of the operands. The carry-out of each full adder is fed as the carry-in to the next significant full adder, thus effectively creating a ripple carry adder configuration for a four-bit addition."
