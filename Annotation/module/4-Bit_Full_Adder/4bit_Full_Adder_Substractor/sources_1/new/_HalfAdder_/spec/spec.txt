Module name: HalfAdder. Module specification: The HalfAdder module is a fundamental digital circuit in Verilog that performs the basic binary addition of two single-bit inputs, i_A and i_B, producing a sum and a carry output. Specifically, i_A and i_B are the inputs representing the two binary digits to be added. The module generates two outputs: o_sum, which provides the sum of i_A and i_B using an XOR operation, effectively giving the least significant bit of the addition; and o_carry, which outputs the carry bit resulting from an AND operation on the two inputs, crucial for multi-bit addition scenarios where this carry is used in higher bit calculations. Internally, the module does not define or use any additional signals; it computes the outputs directly through assignments in the code. The straightforward implementation includes two main operations: the assignment of o_sum and o_carry directly linked to the module's inputs, using XOR and AND operations respectively. This design ensures a concise, efficient half-adder without intermediate signal processing, making the module a compact and integral piece for constructing larger arithmetic units.
