The HalfAdder module performs binary addition on two single-bit inputs, i_A and i_B, yielding a sum and a carry as outputs. It directly computes the sum using an XOR operation (`o_sum = i_A ^ i_B`) and the carry using an AND operation (`o_carry = i_A & i_B`), facilitating compact and efficient addition without internal intermediary signals.
