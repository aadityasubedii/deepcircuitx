Explanation: The module performs the operation of a half adder, which is a basic building block in digital electronics. It takes two single-bit binary inputs, `i_A` and `i_B`, and produces two outputs: `o_sum` and `o_carry`. The `o_sum` output generates the sum of the inputs using an XOR gate, while the `o_carry` output generates the carry signal only when both inputs are high (1), using an AND gate. This is essential in binary addition for constructing larger adders like full adders or adding larger binary numbers."

They represent the two single-bit binary inputs to the half adder circuit, where `i_A` is the first binary digit, and `i_B` is the second binary digit. These inputs are used to compute the sum and carry of a binary addition.\n\nOutput ports: o_sum, o_carry. Explanation: `o_sum` and `o_carry` are the output ports of the HalfAdder module. `o_sum` provides the sum of the two input bits, computed using an XOR operation (symbolized by ^ in Verilog). This output represents the least significant bit of the addition result. `o_carry` outputs the carry bit, which is the result of an AND operation (symbolized by & in Verilog) on the two input bits. This carry output is crucial as it represents the overflow bit that is carried to the next higher bit position in multi-bit binary addition scenarios."

The XOR and AND operations are performed directly on the input signals, `i_A` and `i_B`, to produce the outputs without the use of any intermediary internal signals.
