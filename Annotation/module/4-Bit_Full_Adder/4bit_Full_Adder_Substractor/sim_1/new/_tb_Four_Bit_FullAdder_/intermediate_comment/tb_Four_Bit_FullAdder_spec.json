    "spec": "Module name: tb_Four_Bit_FullAdder. Module specification: The tb_Four_Bit_FullAdder module is a testbench designed to validate the functionality of a four-bit full adder by simulating the addition of two four-bit binary numbers and a carry input. The module is composed of input registers i_A and i_B, each 4 bits wide, which represent the two operands for the addition operations. Another register, i_Cin, which is 1-bit wide, is the carry input and is fixed at 0 for this test scenario. The outputs of the module include a 4-bit wire o_Sum, which carries the resultant sum of i_A and i_B considering the carry input, and a 1-bit wire o_Cout, which denotes the carry output, indicating any overflow from the most significant bit which can be propagated in cascaded adders. The Four_Bit_FullAdder device under test (dut) is instantiated with these input and output connections. Within the testbench, the initial block sequences the input values at specific simulation times to verify the proper functionality of the adder, advancing from an initial condition, through various operand combinations, to the termination of the simulation indicated by `$finish`. The structure and behavior of this testbench ensure a thorough examination of the four-bit full adder's response to various input scenarios.",

The test scenario initializes certain values for i_A and i_B, and checks how the four-bit adder (dut, or device under test) calculates the sum and carry-out over time.
