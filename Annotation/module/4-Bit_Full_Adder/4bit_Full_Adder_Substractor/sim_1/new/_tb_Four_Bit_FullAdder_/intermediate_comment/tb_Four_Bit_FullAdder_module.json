    "module": "The tb_Four_Bit_FullAdder module serves as a testbench for assessing a four-bit full adder's functionality, focusing on simulating the addition of two four-bit numbers along with a fixed carry input. It employs registers i_A and i_B as inputs, initializes i_Cin to zero, and checks the output on wire o_Sum and o_Cout at predetermined intervals. The sequence of operations within the initial block drives different test scenarios, providing a systematic validation of the adder's response to varying inputs, ensuring correct behavior through the simulation lifecycle."
