Module specification: The 'tb_Full_Adder_Substractor_4bit' module is a test bench intended for verifying the functionality of a digital circuit that can perform both addition and subtraction on two 4-bit operands based on a mode control. It includes input ports `i_A` and `i_B`, which are both 4-bit registers representing the two operands for the arithmetic operations; `i_Mode`, a 1-bit register that dictates the operation mode (0 for addition, 1 for subtraction); and output ports `o_Sum`, a 4-bit wire delivering the result of the arithmetic operation (sum when adding, difference when subtracting), and `o_Cout`, a 1-bit wire indicating an overflow in addition or underflow in subtraction. Internally, this module instances the `Full_Adder_Substractor_4bit` unit, mapping the aforementioned ports and signals accordingly. The test script in the `initial` block sets different test cases by assigning values to `i_A`, `i_B`, `i_Mode`, and observes the responses on `o_Sum` and `o_Cout`, ensuring that the main module functions as expected through several scenarios. The test bench completes its run with a `$finish` command after cycling through the test cases.",
