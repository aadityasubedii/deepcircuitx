It initializes a set of test inputs: `i_A` and `i_B` (both 4-bit wide) as the operands and `i_Mode` as a mode selection signal (1 bit). The results of the operation are observed on `o_Sum` (4-bit output of sum/difference based on mode) and `o_Cout` (carry out bit indicating overflow in adder mode, underflow in subtractor mode). The test includes different operand values and mode settings, and the module terminates execution after these tests."

It participates in either addition or subtraction based on the value of `i_Mode`.\n- `i_B`: This is a 4-bit register used as another input signal representing the second operand.

If `i_Mode` is set to `0`, the operation is an addition; if `i_Mode` is set to `1`, the operation is a subtraction.\n- `o_Sum`: A 4-bit wire that acts as the output carrying the result of the operation between `i_A` and `i_B` according to the operation mode defined by `i_Mode`. It embodies the resultant sum or difference.\n- `o_Cout`: A 1-bit wire designated as the carry-out or overflow/underflow indicator, pivotal in assessing if the result of the arithmetic operation has exceeded the 4-bit width leading to overflow in addition or underflow in subtraction."
