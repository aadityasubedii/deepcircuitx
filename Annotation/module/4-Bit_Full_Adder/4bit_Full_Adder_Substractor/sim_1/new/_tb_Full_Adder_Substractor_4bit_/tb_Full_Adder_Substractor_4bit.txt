The tb_Full_Adder_Substractor_4bit module acts as a test bench for verifying a 4-bit full adder-subtractor circuit, capable of switching between addition and subtraction based on a mode input. It achieves this by initializing test input vectors to the Full_Adder_Substractor_4bit component and observing the result and carry-out signals. Key test scenarios are simulated in a sequential manner, evaluating both operation modes, and it concludes operations with a termination command after the test cases.
