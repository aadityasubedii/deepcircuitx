Explanation: This module serves as a testbench for the HalfAdder circuit, designed to simulate and verify its behavior. It initializes inputs i_A and i_B to various combinations of binary values (0 and 1) over a series of time steps, and observes the outputs o_sum and o_carry to validate the correct functioning of the HalfAdder. Each input scenario is tested with a specified time delay to ensure the HalfAdder's correct response to different input states."

Explanation: The input ports i_A and i_B are used to provide binary signals to the HalfAdder circuit. These signals represent the two binary digits which are to be added. The testbench module drives these inputs with different combinations of 0 and 1 to simulate various addition scenarios and verify the correct behavior of the HalfAdder.\n\nOutput ports: o_sum, o_carry. Explanation: The output ports o_sum and o_carry represent the sum and carry output of the HalfAdder, respectively. o_sum indicates the result of the bitwise addition of i_A and i_B, and o_carry represents the carry out resulting from the addition, which is crucial for multi-bit binary addition in broader applications. The outputs are monitored to ensure that the HalfAdder correctly computes both sum and carry based on the provided inputs."
