    "module": "The tb_HalfAdder module is a testbench for validating the HalfAdder circuit by driving its inputs (i_A, i_B) with various binary pairs and checking the outputs (o_sum, o_carry) for correctness. It initializes the input combinations in a sequential manner with time delays, leveraging reg and wire types for input manipulation and output observation, respectively, followed by testing all input states to evaluate the HalfAdder\u2019s response accuracy."
