Module name: tb_HalfAdder. Module specification: The tb_HalfAdder module serves as a testbench designed to simulate and verify the functionality of the HalfAdder circuit. Its primary role is to initialize and manipulate inputs i_A and i_B with various combinations of binary values (0 and 1) over time to validate correct computation of outputsâ€”o_sum and o_carry by the HalfAdder. The inputs, i_A and i_B, are binary signals representing two digits for addition, structured as reg type internal signals to facilitate value alterations during simulation. The outputs, o_sum and o_carry, reveal the sum and carry of the bitwise addition operation, implemented as wire type internal signals capturing data from the HalfAdder's output. The module encompasses an instantiation of the HalfAdder designated as 'dut' for performing the actual addition. The sequential test cases apply through an initial block where values are sequentially fed to the inputs with a 10ns delay between each scenario, ensuring robust testing of the HalfAdder response at each step. The test ends with the "$finish" command, halting the simulation after all possible input states are tested.
