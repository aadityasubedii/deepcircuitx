Module name: tb_FullAdder. Module specification: The tb_FullAdder is a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of the FullAdder module by driving various combinations of inputs and checking the respective outputs. This module includes three input ports: i_A, i_B, and i_Cin, which represent two binary bits and a carry-in bit respectively. These inputs are essential for testing all permutations of binary additions that the FullAdder can encounter. The output ports, o_Sum and o_Cout, are linked to the results from the FullAdder; o_Sum holds the sum of the inputs while o_Cout holds the carry-out value, which is crucial for cascading in multi-bit addition schemes. Internally, i_A, i_B, and i_Cin are defined as registers to allow stimulus input to be varied over time, and o_Sum and o_Cout are wires directly connected to the output of the instantiated FullAdder. The testbench module initializes the input conditions and toggles through a series of tests at 10 ns intervals, examining how the FullAdder responds to different input scenarios and ensuring the results are as per expectations. The test sequence concludes with a $finish command to terminate the simulation.
