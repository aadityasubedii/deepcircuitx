    "module": "The tb_FullAdder module serves as a testbench for the FullAdder, systematically verifying its functionality by simulating all possible binary input scenarios for addition, including carry-in and carry-out conditions. It employs three input registers (i_A, i_B, i_Cin) to generate test cases and two output wires (o_Sum, o_Cout) connected to the FullAdder outputs to observe the results. The simulation iterates through different input combinations at fixed time intervals, examining the resultant sum and carry for correctness, thereby ensuring the FullAdder's reliability in processing binary addition."
