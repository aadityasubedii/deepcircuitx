Module name: pfa. Module specification: The "pfa" (Pipelined Full Adder) module is engineered to perform the addition of two 4-bit binary numbers, 'a' and 'b', and a carry input, 'cin'. This addition outputs a 4-bit sum and a 4-bit carry. The module operates synchronously with a clock signal 'clk' and features a reset 'rst' that initializes its interior state. Key inputs include 'clk' (clock signal guiding synchronization), 'rst' (reset signal clearing states and outputs), 'a' and 'b' (4-bit operands for the addition), and 'cin' (carry-in bit). The outputs are 'sum' and 'carry', both 4-bit values showing the result of the addition and respective carry-outs. Internally, the module utilizes registers 'ar', 'br', and 'c_in' to stabilize the values of 'a', 'b', and 'cin' through the computational cycle, preventing data changes from affecting computation during execution. The 'pipefulladder' submodule, driven by these registers, computes the intermediary sum 'sr' and carry 'cr'. An 'always' block triggers on the positive edge of 'clk' or 'rst', loading values into the registers and updating outputs based on the computed results from 'pipefulladder', ensuring correct operational timing and reset behavior.
