    "module": "The 'fulladderfour' module performs a three-input one-bit full addition, computing the sum and carry-out. It directly assigns the sum using the XOR operation on inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin', and the carry-out is derived by OR-ing the results of pairwise AND operations of these inputs. This efficient design facilitates easy integration into larger arithmetic circuits without internal signal overhead."
