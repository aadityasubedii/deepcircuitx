Module name: fulladderfour. Module specification: The 'fulladderfour' module in Verilog implements a full adder specifically designed for adding three one-bit numbers: 'a', 'b', and 'cin' (carry-in from a previous addition). The output of the module includes 'sum', which represents the result of the addition using bitwise XOR, and 'carry', representing the carry-out using pairwise AND operations followed by an OR. The module contains no internal signals as it computes the outputs directly from the inputs using basic logical operations. The code delineates clear, straightforward logic assignment for both 'sum' and 'carry' outputs within the body of the module, ensuring an optimal and efficient design for use in larger arithmetic circuits by simply chaining multiple instances of this module together.
