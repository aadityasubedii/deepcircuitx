    "module": "The 'testbench' module tests a 4-bit full adder by generating and applying all possible combinations of binary inputs for operands `A`, `B`, and the carry-in `Ci`, checking outputs `S` and `Co`. It uses nested looping with counters `i` and `k` to iterate through the combinations, simulating exhaustive addition scenarios. The module also generates a waveform output `waveform.vpd` for visual inspection of the full adder's behavior during the test."
