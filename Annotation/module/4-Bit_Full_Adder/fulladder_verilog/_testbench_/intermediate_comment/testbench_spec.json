    "spec": "Module name: testbench. Module specification: The 'testbench' module is tasked with validating the functionality of a 4-bit full adder component named `fulladder_4bit`. It simulates the full adder by generating all possible combinations of the 4-bit inputs `A` and `B` along with the carry input `Ci`, systematically testing its arithmetic capabilities through exhaustive combinations of input cases. The input ports include `A` and `B`, which are each 4-bit registers storing operands for the addition, and `Ci`, a single-bit carry-in which is crucial for simulating chained binary addition operations. The outputs consist of a 4-bit wire `S` representing the sum of `A`, `B`, and `Ci`, and a single-bit wire `Co` which indicates if there's a carry-out beyond the significant bit. Internally, the module utilizes two integer counters, `i` and `k`, which help iterate through possible binary values of `A` and `B`, providing a comprehensive check across all possible states these inputs can attain. The testbench starts by initializing inputs `A`, `B`, and `Ci` to zero and then systematically increments `B` and `A` within nested loops to cover all binary additions possible with 4-bit numbers. Additionally, it generates a waveform file 'waveform.vpd' via specific commands to visualize the operation and outcome of each simulated input scenario, ensuring an effective visual and logical verification environment for the full adder\u2019s functionality.",
