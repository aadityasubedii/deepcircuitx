Module name: fulladder and fulladder_4bit. Module specification: The "fulladder" module is designed to perform a single-bit full addition, taking binary inputs 'a', 'b', and 'ci' (carry-in) to produce an output sum 's' and a carry-out 'co'. In this module, the sum 's' is computed using the XOR operation between inputs 'a', 'b', and 'ci', while the carry-out 'co' is derived either from the combination logic of 'a' and 'b', or from the carry-in involving '(a XOR b)'. Moving to the "fulladder_4bit" module, it extends the functionality to handle 4-bit binary numbers, effectively cascading four instances of "fulladder" to perform 4-bit addition. It accepts 4-bit input operands 'A' and 'B', and an initial carry-in 'Ci', generating a 4-bit sum 'S' and a final carry-out 'Co'. Internally, it utilizes signals 'i1', 'i2', and 'i3' to transfer carry information between successive single-bit addersâ€”'fa0' through 'fa3'. Here, 'i1' carries the intermediate carry-out from the least significant bit full adder ('fa0') to the next ('fa1'), 'i2' carries it from 'fa1' to 'fa2', and 'i3' carries it from 'fa2' to the most significant bit addition in 'fa3'. This well-defined module design supports chaining of operations, allowing it to be part of larger systems requiring arithmetic computations or other combinational logic operations based on bit-wise addition.
