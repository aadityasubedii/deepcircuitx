The `fulladder` module performs a single-bit full addition operation where given binary inputs 'a', 'b', and 'ci' (carry in), it produces a sum 's' and a carry out 'co'. The `fulladder_4bit` module represents a 4-bit full adder formed by cascading four `fulladder` instances to handle 4-bit input operands 'A' and 'B', and a carry input 'Ci'. It generates a 4-bit sum 'S' and a final carry out 'Co', effectively performing a 4-bit addition operation by passing intermediate carries between successive single-bit full adder modules."

It is considered during the addition of `a` and `b` to generate the sum and the next carry out.\n\n**Output ports:** `s, co`.\n**Explanation:**\n- `s`: This is the sum output of the binary addition of `a`, `b`, and the carry-in `ci`.\n- `co`: This is the carry out.
