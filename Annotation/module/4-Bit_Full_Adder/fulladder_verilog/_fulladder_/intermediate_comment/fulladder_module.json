    "module": "The fulladder module performs single-bit addition with inputs 'a', 'b', and 'ci', outputting sum 's' and carry-out 'co', where sum is calculated using XOR operations and carry-out through AND-OR logic. The fulladder_4bit module extends this to 4-bit numbers by cascading four fulladder instances, handling carry propagation through internal signals 'i1', 'i2', and 'i3' to compute the 4-bit sum 'S' and final carry-out 'Co'."
