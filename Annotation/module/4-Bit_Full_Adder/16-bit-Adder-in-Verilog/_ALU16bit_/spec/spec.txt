Module name: ALU16bit.  
Module specification: The ALU16bit is a 16-bit arithmetic logic unit designed in Verilog for performing arithmetic and logical operations on two 16-bit input vectors, `x` and `y`. The resultant output `z` is a 16-bit vector displaying the result of the operation executed across the inputs in 4-bit sections, where each section is processed by its dedicated sub-module, ALU4bit. The module also outputs several status flags: `sign` indicating the sign of the result by reflecting the most significant bit of `z`, `carry` showing carry-out from the most significant bit, `overflow` indicating arithmetic overflow, `parity` representing the parity (even or odd) of the count of ones in `z`, and `zero` indicating whether the result `z` is zero. The internal signal `c_wire[3:1]` is used to propagate carry between consecutive 4-bit ALU blocks, critical for accurate computation in chained arithmetic operations. Each ALU4bit block handles operations on distinct 4-bit segments of `x` and `y`, and their interconnections through `c_wire` ensure correct carry propagation. The ALU16bit thereby integrates these operations and flags to produce a versatile computing unit for handling 16-bit integers in digital systems.
