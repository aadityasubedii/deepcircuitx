    "module": "The ALU16bit module performs arithmetic and logical operations on two 16-bit input vectors (`x` and `y`), outputting a 16-bit result (`z`) and status flags (sign, carry, overflow, parity, zero). It processes inputs in 4-bit chunks using four ALU4bit sub-modules, with carry propagation between them managed by the `c_wire` internal signals, ensuring accurate result computation and flag determinations."
