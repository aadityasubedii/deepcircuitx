This ALU integrates operations between two 16-bit inputs A and B, and outputs the result to a 16-bit output C, with additional flags for sign (S), zero (Zr), carry (Cy), parity (P), and overflow (Ov). In the testbench, various test cases are automated where different values are assigned to inputs A and B. The operations are carried out sequentially with specific time delays, and the responses are monitored and dumped for verification into a file named \"ALU16bit.vcd\" to analyze the ALU\u2019s performance and behavior under different conditions."
