The ALU16bit_test module serves as a testbench for evaluating a 16-bit ALU's operations across various scenarios. It initializes the simulation environment, assigns different test values to the inputs A and B, and utilizes the ALU16bit module to process these inputs. The results and status flags (C, S, Zr, Cy, P, Ov) are monitored and recorded using $monitor to ensure the ALU performs as expected under different conditions, culminating with a simulation finish command.
