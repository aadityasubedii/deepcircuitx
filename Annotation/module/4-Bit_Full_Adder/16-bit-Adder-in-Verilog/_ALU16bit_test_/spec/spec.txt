Module name: ALU16bit_test.
Module specification: The ALU16bit_test is a testbench Verilog module designed to systematically evaluate the functionalities of a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) known as ALU16bit. It functions by simulating various operational scenarios on the ALU using predetermined input combinations for two 16-bit registers, A and B, which serve as primary operands. The output from ALU16bit includes a 16-bit result wire C and several status indicators: S (sign of the result), Zr (whether the result is zero), Cy (indicates a carry-out), P (parity of the result), and Ov (indicates overflow). These outputs are monitored for correctness based on the expected outcomes of the operations applied to A and B. The testbench initializes with the configuration of a VCD file for waveform tracing and sets different values to the inputs at specified times to observe the behavior and performance of the ALU under varying conditions. The monitor function within the initial block provides real-time tracking of resulting values and flags, aiding in comprehensive verification of the ALUâ€™s function across multiple test cases until the simulation is concluded with a $finish command.
