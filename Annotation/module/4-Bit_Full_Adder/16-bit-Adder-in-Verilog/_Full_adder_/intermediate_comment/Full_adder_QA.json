It produces a sum and a carry-out bit as outputs. The summation is achieved through two XOR gates calculating the sum and the carry, while the carry_out is determined by two AND gates and another XOR gate combining their results. This functionality is crucial in constructing arithmetic circuits that handle binary addition."
