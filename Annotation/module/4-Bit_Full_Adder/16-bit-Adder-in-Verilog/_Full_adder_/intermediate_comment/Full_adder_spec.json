    "spec": "Module name: Fulladder. Module specification: The Fulladder module is designed to execute the full addition of two binary bits (in1 and in2) along with an input carry bit (carry_in), producing a sum and a carry-out (carry_out) as outputs, essential for constructing multi-bit arithmetic circuits. The module consists of three input ports: 'in1' and 'in2', which are the primary bits for addition, and 'carry_in', which indicates if there's an additional carry from a previous addition. It outputs two ports: 'sum', the least significant bit of addition, and 'carry_out', indicating an overflow, serving as a carry for further additions. Internally, the module uses a wire array 'wires[2:0]', where 'wires[0]' holds the result of 'in1' XOR 'in2', crucial for determining both sum and part of the carry-out; 'wires[1]' carries the result of 'wires[0]' AND 'carry_in', contributing to the carry-out calculation; and 'wires[2]', resulting from 'in1' AND 'in2', additionally deliberates the carry-out. The arithmetic operations are modularized into five main gates: two XOR gates (G1 and G2) calculating the sum and an intermediate value, and two AND gates (G3 and G4), plus another XOR gate (G5) effectively determining the carry-out based on internal wires logic, modeling a typical full adder circuit.",
