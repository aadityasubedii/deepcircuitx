The Fulladder module performs full binary addition of two bits and a carry-in, outputting a sum and a carry-out bit. It leverages three input bits (in1, in2, carry_in), and internally manages bitwise operations using XOR for sum calculation and AND for carry out computation, organized through well-defined logic gates and intermediary wires to produce accurate arithmetic results.
