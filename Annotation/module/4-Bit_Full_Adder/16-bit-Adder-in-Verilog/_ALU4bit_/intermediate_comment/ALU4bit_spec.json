    "spec": "Module name: ALU4bit. \nModule specification: The ALU4bit is a Verilog module designed to function as a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that performs binary addition on two 4-bit input signals, A and B, along with handling carry input (Cin) and output (Cout) for overflow management. The input ports include two 4-bit signals, A and B, used for the operands of addition, and a single-bit signal, Cin, which serves as the initial carry-in for the least significant bit. The output ports comprise a 4-bit signal, Result, that stores the sum of A and B considering inter-bit carry propagation, and a single-bit carry output, Cout, indicating overflow beyond the most significant bit. Internally, the module utilizes an array of wires, `carry_wires[3:1]`, to propagate carry outputs from one bit addition to the next. The module encompasses four instances of another module, Fulladder, each taking responsibility for adding corresponding bits of A and B. The first Fulladder (FA1) takes Cin as its carry-in, while each subsequent Fulladder (from FA2 to FA4) takes its carry-in from the previous Fulladder's carry output. The final carry output is directed from FA4 to Cout, completing the carry chain. This structural configuration facilitates sequential addition with carry forwarding essential for multi-bit arithmetic operations within digital circuits.",

The module utilizes four instances of another module called Fulladder, each responsible for adding corresponding bits from the inputs A and B along with a carry generated from the preceding bit operation.

The carry_out of each Fulladder except the last is fed as carry_in to the next, while the last carry_out is connected to Cout.
