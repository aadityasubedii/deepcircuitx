It includes a carry input (Cin) and a carry output (Cout) to handle overflows. The module utilizes four instances of another module called Fulladder, each responsible for adding corresponding bits from the inputs A and B along with a carry generated from the preceding bit operation. The results of these additions form the 4-bit output Result, with each bit calculated by a separate Fulladder. The carry_out of each Fulladder except the last is fed as carry_in to the next, while the last carry_out is connected to Cout. Therefore, the ALU4bit aggregates the function of single-bit additions across four bits, using chaining of carries to manage inter-bit dependencies."

Each bit from A and B is fed into corresponding Fulladder modules to perform bit-wise addition.\n- Cin is a single-bit input that represents the carry input to the first Fulladder module (FA1). It is used for adding the least significant bits of A and B, allowing for carry propagation from a previous operation or an initial carry value.\n\nOutput ports: Result, Cout.\nExplanation:\n- Result is a 4-bit output port. Each bit of Result is the sum output from each of the Fulladder modules. It represents the binary result of adding the two 4-bit numbers A and B, with consideration of any carry bits produced during the additions.\n- Cout is a single-bit output that represents the carry output from the last Fulladder module (FA4). It signals an overflow out of the most significant bit, which is crucial for chaining ALU operations or indicating an arithmetic overflow."
