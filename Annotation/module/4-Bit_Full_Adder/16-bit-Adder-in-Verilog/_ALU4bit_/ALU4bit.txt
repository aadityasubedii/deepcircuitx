The ALU4bit module performs 4-bit binary addition on two inputs, A and B, processing carries between bit additions. It uses four Fulladder submodules to add respective bits from A and B, passing inter-bit carries through internal wires, `carry_wires[3:1]`, starting from an initial carry-in Cin and ending with a carry-out Cout for overflow indication. Each Fulladder connects its sum output to the corresponding bit of the Result, ensuring sequential computation and carry propagation across the bits.
