Module specification: The `decoder_2x4_tb` module is a testbench designed to verify the functionality of a `decoder_2x4` decoder module by simulating various input scenarios. It features one 2-bit input port `A` and one 4-bit output port `D`. `A`, as a 2-bit input vector (`reg [1:0] A`), is utilized to provide distinct binary values ranging from 2'b00 to 2'b11 to the decoder, systematically testing all possible input combinations. The output `D` (`wire [3:0] D`) captures and displays the decoder's outputs, allowing verification of its correct response to the input variations. The testing procedure involves sequentially assigning values to `A` over scheduled time steps, checking the corresponding outputs on `D`. The module's code comprises an initial block which sequentially stimulates the input `A` with all possible 2-bit combinations, observing the outputs on `D` at each step, followed by a termination of the simulation after all inputs are tested. This structured process ensures comprehensive testing of the decoder\u2019s functionality.",
