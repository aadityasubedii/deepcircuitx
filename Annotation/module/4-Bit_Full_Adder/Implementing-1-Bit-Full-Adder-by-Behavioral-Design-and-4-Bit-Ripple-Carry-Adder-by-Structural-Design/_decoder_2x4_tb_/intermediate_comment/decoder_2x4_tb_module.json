    "module": "The `decoder_2x4_tb` module serves as a testbench to validate the `decoder_2x4` by cycling through all binary combinations of its 2-bit input `A`. This is implemented by setting `A` through a sequence of planned time steps, observing the resultant 4-bit output `D`, and ensuring proper decoder output according to each input case, followed by a simulation termination after all tests."
