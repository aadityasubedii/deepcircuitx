Module name: mux_4x1_tb. Module specification: The "mux_4x1_tb" module functions as a testbench for verifying the operation of a 4-to-1 multiplexer (mux_4x1). This module includes input ports 'i' and 's', and an output port 'F'. The input port 'i' is a 4-bit register that presents four distinct signals to the multiplexer, allowing for test scenarios under different input conditions. The port 's' is a 2-bit selector that decides which of the four input signals from 'i' is routed to the output. The output port 'F' reflects the selected input, verifying the mux operation. Internal to the module, the signals include 'i', 's', and 'F', where 'i' and 's' are registered to hold varying test values, and 'F' is a wire outputting the selection result from the multiplexer. The Verilog code essentially comprises an initial block that sequentially applies various combinations of input values to 'i' and 's', stimulating the multiplexer through different states, and a component instantiation of mux_4x1 connects these internal signals properly. This test sequence is designed to thoroughly assess the multiplexer's response to all selector and input combinations over time until the simulation finishes.
