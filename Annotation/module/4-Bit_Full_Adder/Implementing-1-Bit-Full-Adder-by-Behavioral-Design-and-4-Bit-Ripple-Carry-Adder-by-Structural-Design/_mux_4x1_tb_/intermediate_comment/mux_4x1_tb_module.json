    "module": "The mux_4x1_tb module is designed to test a 4-to-1 multiplexer by simulating various input scenarios. It utilizes a 4-bit register 'i' to supply input signals and a 2-bit selector 's' to choose among these signals, observing the output through the 'F' wire. Multiple test cases are executed by altering values in 'i' and 's' in a predefined sequence within an initial block, validating the multiplexer's output correctness."
