Module name: decoder_2x4. Module specification: The decoder_2x4 module is designed to perform 2-to-4 binary decoding, taking a 2-bit binary input and producing one of four active-high outputs. The input port `A`, which is a 2-bit vector `input[1:0] A`, represents the binary number to be decoded. Depending on the value of `A`, one of the output bits in the 4-bit output vector `output[3:0] D` is set high, while the others remain low. Specifically, `D[3]` becomes high when A is '11', `D[2]` when A is '01', `D[1]` when A is '10', and `D[0]` when A is '00'. The module uses direct assignment statements to map input combinations to their respective outputs without any internal signals, indicating a straightforward logical translation from input to outputs. The code employs four assignment statements, each handling the logic for one output bit, using basic logical operations on the input bits `A[0]` and `A[1]`. This operational simplicity ensures that the module efficiently decodes the input with minimal complexity.
