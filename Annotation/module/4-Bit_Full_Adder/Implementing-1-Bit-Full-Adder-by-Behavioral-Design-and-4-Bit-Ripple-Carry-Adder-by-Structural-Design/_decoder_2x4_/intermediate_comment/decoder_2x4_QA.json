It takes a 2-bit binary input 'A' and decodes it into one of four active-high outputs represented by the 4-bit output 'D'. Each output line 'D[3] to D[0]' is activated exclusively based on the value of the input 'A', effectively mapping each possible input combination (00, 01, 10, 11) to a specific output line being high (1) while others remain low (0)."

It determines which output of 'D' should be set high, based on its binary value (00, 01, 10, or 11).\n\nOutput ports: [D]. \nExplanation: D is a 4-bit output vector (`output[3:0] D`) where each bit corresponds to one of the four decoded outputs from input A. Each bit in D (D[3], D[2], D[1], D[0]) will be set high according to the specific binary combination presented at the input A, with all other bits being low.
