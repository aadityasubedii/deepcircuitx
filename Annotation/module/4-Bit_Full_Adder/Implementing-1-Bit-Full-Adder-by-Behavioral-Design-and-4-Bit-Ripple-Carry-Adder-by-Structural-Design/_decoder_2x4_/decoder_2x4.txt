The decoder_2x4 module decodes a 2-bit input into one of four active-high outputs, effectively mapping each input combination (00, 01, 10, 11) to a specific output line being high. This is achieved through direct bitwise logical operations on the input bits A[0] and A[1], each mapped to a specific output bit in the output vector D using simple assignment statements, guaranteeing that only one output bit is high at any given time.
