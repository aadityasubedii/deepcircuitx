    "module": "The `circuit_tb` is a template testbench module used for simulating and testing electronic circuits without any predefined inputs or outputs, and currently lacks implementation details. Its design serves as a placeholder, setting a foundation for future development wherein stimulus and monitoring code can be integrated to evaluate circuit behavior under test conditions."
