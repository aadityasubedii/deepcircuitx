Module name: mux_4x1. Module specification: The 'mux_4x1' module implements a 4-to-1 multiplexer functionality in Verilog. It selectively outputs one of four input bits based on a 2-bit selector. The module has input ports `i[3:0]`, a 4-bit input vector where each bit corresponds to a different data input, and `s[1:0]`, a 2-bit selector that determines which input bit is routed to the single-bit output port `F`. The output `F` is the result of internal logic that uses NOT and AND gates to process the inputs and selectors, followed by an OR gate that formulates the final output. Internally, the module uses signals `s1neg` and `s0neg` to hold the negated values of the selector bits, aiding in the selection process. Additionally, signals `T1`, `T2`, `T3`, and `T4` hold the intermediate ANDed results corresponding to the potential input selections based on the selectors and their negations. The section involving NOT gates negates the selector bits, the AND gates compute the gated inputs based on the selector states, and the OR gate combines these intermediates to produce the output bit `F`. This design ensures that depending on the value of `s`, the correct input bit from `i` is output through `F`.
