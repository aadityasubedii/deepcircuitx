It takes a 4-bit input vector `i` and a 2-bit selector `s`, and outputs a single bit `F`. Depending on the value of the selector `s`, `F` is assigned the value of one of the four input bits. Specifically, the output `F` is determined by using not and and gates to control which input bit is selected based on the negated or direct values of `s`.

Depending on the value of `s`, one of the four inputs from the vector `i` is selected.\n\nOutput ports: `F`.\nExplanation: `F` is a single output bit that holds the value selected from the input vector `i` based on the binary value of selector `s`. This output is the result of the logic implemented internally in the multiplexer, employing NOT and AND gates to determine the selected input, combined into one output using an OR gate."
