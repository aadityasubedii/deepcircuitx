    "module": "The mux_4x1 module implements a 4-to-1 multiplexer, selecting one of four input bits based on a 2-bit selector and routing it to a single output bit. It uses NOT gates to negate selector bits, AND gates to generate conditional outputs based on the selector states, and an OR gate to combine these outputs, ultimately determining the output bit F based on the selector input."
