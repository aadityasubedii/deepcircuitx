Module name: mojo_top_0.
Module specification: The 'mojo_top_0' module plays a pivotal role in performing binary arithmetic tests and managing state signaled outputs like lighting LEDs according to a predefined Finite State Machine (FSM). Specifically, it manages inputs such as clock signals (clk), active-low reset (rst_n), button presses (io_button), and dip switching signals (io_dip), alongside arithmetic operation feedback (sum, cout). The outputs include control over LEDs (both regular 'led' and 'io_led'), seven-segment display signals ('io_seg' and 'io_sel'), and signals representing binary arithmetic inputs ('a', 'b', 'cin'). Internal signals like rst (processed reset signal), M_reset_cond_in/out (reset conditioner flows), and M_state_d/q (storing next and current FSM states) ensure robust operations through debounced processing and strong state management. The code embodies sections for setting up signal conditioning for reset, defining state transitions based on various logic conditions and displaying corresponding outputs, including the handling of outputs to visual indicators. The states of the FSM vary from IDLE to TEST states where each state represents a testing scenario of the binary arithmetic operations, culminating in SUCCESS or FAIL states based on the outcomes of these tests. This structure is designed to aid debugging and functionality verification by leveraging input conditions and transitions to visually represent arithmetic correctness and state conditions through hardware implementations like LEDs and segment displays.
