Module specification: The `counter_4` module is a counter designed to increment its count from 0 up to a maximum value of `MAX_VALUE` (0x3FFFF) and then wrap around to 0. The counter is designed to operate synchronously with the positive edge of a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst`) to 0 when required. It features two main input ports: `clk`, which is the primary clock signal driving the counter updates, and `rst`, a reset signal which when asserted high resets the counter to zero. The output of the module is `value`, a 2-bit signal that represents the two most significant bits of the current counter value (`M_ctr_q[17:16]`). Internally, the module utilizes two significant signals: `M_ctr_d` and `M_ctr_q`. `M_ctr_q` holds the current value of the counter, while `M_ctr_d` is used to calculate the next value of the counter based on the current state and control logic within a combinational always block (`always @*`). This block handles the calculation of `M_ctr_d` by incrementing `M_ctr_q` or resetting it based on the wrapped value and control conditions. The sequential always block (`always @(posedge clk)`) is responsible for updating `M_ctr_q` with `M_ctr_d` on each clock cycle unless a reset is activated. This design ensures the counter progresses correctly through its count cycle and outputs relevant sections of its current count through its lifecycle.",

Each time the counter is incremented, a part of its current value (`M_ctr_q[17:16]`) is output as a 2-bit `value`.
