    "module": "The \"multi_seven_seg_2\" module controls a 4-digit seven-segment display to continuously show numbers provided through a 16-bit input. It cycles through each digit using a 2-bit counter, segments numbers into 4-bit chunks, decodes these chunks into 7-bit segment patterns for display control, and uses a 2-to-4 decoder to select one active digit at a time, all synchronized by a clock input and resettable via a reset input."
