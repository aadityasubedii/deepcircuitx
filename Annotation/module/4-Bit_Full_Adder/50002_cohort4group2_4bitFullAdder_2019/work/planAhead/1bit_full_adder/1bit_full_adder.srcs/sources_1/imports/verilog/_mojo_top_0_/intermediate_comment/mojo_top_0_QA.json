This is achieved through a finite state machine (FSM) with states from IDLE to several TEST states, alongside SUCCESS and FAIL states. The states transition based on button inputs, arithmetic outcomes of input signals (a, b, cin, sum, cout), and reset conditions, displaying corresponding values on a seven-segment display to indicate the state or results of the movement through various test conditions. Additionally, the module integrates signal conditioning and provides responsiveness to hardware reset signals."

M_state_d is the next state designation held during the clock cycle and based on current state (M_state_q) and input conditions.
