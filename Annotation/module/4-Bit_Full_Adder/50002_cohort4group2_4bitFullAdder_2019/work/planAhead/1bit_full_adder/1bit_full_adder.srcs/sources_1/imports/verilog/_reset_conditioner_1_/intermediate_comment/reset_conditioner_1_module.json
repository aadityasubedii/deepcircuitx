    "module": "The `reset_conditioner_1` module debounces a reset signal using a shift register method. It takes a clock (`clk`) and an input signal (`in`), updating a 4-bit shift register (`M_stage_q`) based on these inputs. If `in` is high, the register immediately sets to 4'hf; otherwise, it shifts right, inserting a zero at the leftmost bit. The output (`out`) is derived from the most significant bit of this register, ensuring the reset output is stable and debounced."
