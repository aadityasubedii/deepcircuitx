    "module": "The `counter_4` module implements a wrap-around counter from 0 to 0x3FFFF, outputting the upper two bits of the current count. It increments its count on each clock edge, resetting to zero when the reset signal is high. Internally, two registers, `M_ctr_q` and `M_ctr_d`, manage the current and next count states respectively, within combinational and sequential blocks to ensure synchronous counter updates with the clock and immediate response to reset commands."
