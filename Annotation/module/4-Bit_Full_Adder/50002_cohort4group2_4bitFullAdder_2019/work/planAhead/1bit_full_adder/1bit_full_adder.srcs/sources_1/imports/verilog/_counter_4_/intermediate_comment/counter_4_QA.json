Each time the counter is incremented, a part of its current value (`M_ctr_q[17:16]`) is output as a 2-bit `value`. The counter operation advances on each positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`) and resets to 0 when the reset signal (`rst`) is asserted high. The operations within the module are handled by two procedural blocks: one combinational using `always @*` for calculating the next counter state and output based on the current state, and one sequential using `always @(posedge clk)` for updating the counter's state."
