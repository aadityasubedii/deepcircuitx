Different values of `char` select specific patterns of these segments, which represent different numbers or symbols. This is controlled using a `case` statement where each possible input value of `char` maps to a specific pattern. The default case sets all segments to off if the input doesn't match any defined case."

This port essentially selects one of the defined patterns based on its value.\n\nOutput ports: [segs]. Explanation: The output port 'segs' is a 7-bit output where each bit controls one segment of a seven-segment display. The specific pattern output to 'segs' is determined by the value of the input 'char', using a series of predefined mappings in a case statement within the module. The value of 'segs' directly corresponds to which segments are turned on or off to display a certain character or number on the display."
