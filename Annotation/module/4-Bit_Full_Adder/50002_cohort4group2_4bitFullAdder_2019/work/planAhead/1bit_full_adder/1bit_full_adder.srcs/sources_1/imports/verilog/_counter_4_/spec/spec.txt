Module name: counter_4. Module specification: The `counter_4` module is a counter designed to increment its count from 0 up to a maximum value of `MAX_VALUE` (0x3FFFF) and then wrap around to 0. The counter is designed to operate synchronously with the positive edge of a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst`) to 0 when required. It features two main input ports: `clk`, which is the primary clock signal driving the counter updates, and `rst`, a reset signal which when asserted high resets the counter to zero. The output of the module is `value`, a 2-bit signal that represents the two most significant bits of the current counter value (`M_ctr_q[17:16]`). Internally, the module utilizes two significant signals: `M_ctr_d` and `M_ctr_q`. `M_ctr_q` holds the current value of the counter, while `M_ctr_d` is used to calculate the next value of the counter based on the current state and control logic within a combinational always block (`always @*`). This block handles the calculation of `M_ctr_d` by incrementing `M_ctr_q` or resetting it based on the wrapped value and control conditions. The sequential always block (`always @(posedge clk)`) is responsible for updating `M_ctr_q` with `M_ctr_d` on each clock cycle unless a reset is activated. This design ensures the counter progresses correctly through its count cycle and outputs relevant sections of its current count through its lifecycle.
