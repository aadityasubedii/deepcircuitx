Module name: reset_conditioner_1. Module specification: The `reset_conditioner_1` module is designed to debounce or condition a reset signal using a clock signal (`clk`) and an input signal (`in`). The module features an input `clk`, which is the clock signal that drives the timing of state changes within the module, and an input `in`, which is the reset signal to be conditioned. The output `out` delivers the conditioned reset signal, derived from the most significant bit of an internal 4-bit shift register. Internally, the module utilizes two 4-bit registers: `M_stage_q`, the shift register storing the current state and initialized to `4'hf` to start in a fully set state, and `M_stage_d`, which temporarily holds the next state of the shift register. The combinational logic block updates `M_stage_d` based on `M_stage_q`, shifting the register right by one bit and inserting a '0' at the leftmost position, unless `in` is high, in which case `M_stage_d` resets to `4'hf`. The sequential logic block updates `M_stage_q` at each positive clock edge, based on the value of `in`. If `in` is high, `M_stage_q` is set to `4'hf`; otherwise, it is updated to the value of `M_stage_d`. Thus, the module ensures the output reset signal is stable and debounced by conditioning it over multiple clock cycles.
