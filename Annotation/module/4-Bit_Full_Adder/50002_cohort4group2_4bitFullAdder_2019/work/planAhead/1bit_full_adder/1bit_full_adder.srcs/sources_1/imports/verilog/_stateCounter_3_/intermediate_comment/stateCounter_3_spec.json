    "spec": "Module name: stateCounter_3. Module specification: The 'stateCounter_3' module functions predominantly as a counter utilizing a 27-bit register. It is designed to increment this counter with every positive edge of the clock if not reset. The input ports include a clock signal 'clk', employed to synchronize the counter's updates, and a reset 'rst', which when high, resets the counter to zero. The sole output port, 'inc_state', indicates the status of the most significant bit (MSB) of the counter, effectively signaling an overflow when toggling from '1' to '0'. Internally, two signals, 'M_stateCounter_d' and 'M_stateCounter_q', represent the next (or desired) state of the counter and the current state, respectively. Initially, 'M_stateCounter_q' is set to 0, and on every clock cycle, 'M_stateCounter_d' calculates the next count by incrementing 'M_stateCounter_q'. If the MSB of 'M_stateCounter_q' is '1', it sets the MSB of 'M_stateCounter_d' to '0' to manage the overflow. There are two primary always blocks in the code: the combinational block, which prepares the next state of the counter and determines the output 'inc_state', and the sequential block, which either resets 'M_stateCounter_q' to 0 on reset or updates it with the value from 'M_stateCounter_d' on the clock's positive edge. This design allows the module to effectively function as a digital counter with overflow management.",
