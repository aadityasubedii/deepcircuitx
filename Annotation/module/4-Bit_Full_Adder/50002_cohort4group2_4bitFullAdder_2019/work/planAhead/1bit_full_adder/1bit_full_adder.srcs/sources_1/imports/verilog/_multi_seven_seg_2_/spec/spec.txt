Module name: multi_seven_seg_2. 
Module specification: The "multi_seven_seg_2" module is designed to control a multi-digit seven-segment display for displaying numerical data. It takes a 16-bit input `values`, where each set of 4 bits represents a number for each of the four digits displayed. There are two main inputs: `clk` (clock signal) that synchronizes the operations, and `rst` (reset signal) which initializes the internal state and counters. The outputs are a 7-bit `seg`, which controls the segments of the display, and a 4-bit `sel`, determining which digit is currently active. Internally, the module uses `M_ctr_value` from the `counter_4` to index through the digits, `M_seg_dec_char` and `M_seg_dec_segs` from `seven_seg_5` for determining and setting the segment configurations, and `M_digit_dec_in` and `M_digit_dec_out` from `decoder_6` for digit selection. The code includes instances of `counter_4` to manage digit cycling, `seven_seg_5` for translating numeric data to segment patterns, and `decoder_6` to cycle the active digit based on the counter. This structured approach ensures that the seven-segment display correctly represents the 16-bit input as a continuously updating four-digit number.
