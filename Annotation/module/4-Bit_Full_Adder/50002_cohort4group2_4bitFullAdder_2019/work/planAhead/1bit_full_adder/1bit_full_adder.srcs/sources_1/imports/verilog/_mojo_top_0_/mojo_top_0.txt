The 'mojo_top_0' module orchestrates binary arithmetic testing and state-driven output control, particularly for lighting LEDs and displaying statuses on a seven-segment display through a meticulously defined Finite State Machine (FSM). Internally, it employs debounced reset processing, state-conditioning logic, and direct linking of inputs like button presses and arithmetic results to outputs such as LEDs and display segments, managing transitions and outputs based on the binary arithmetic conditions and user interactions to visually demonstrate functional correctness and test state progression.
