Module name: decoder_6. Module specification: The module 'decoder_6' functions as a 2-to-4 binary decoder using Verilog. It takes a 2-bit binary input 'in', which guides the module in setting exactly one out of four output bits in the 4-bit output port 'out' to high (1), with all other bits set to low (0). The input port '[1:0] in' determines which specific bit in the output '[3:0] out' is set to high, with each value from 0 to 3 corresponding directly to one of the bit positions in 'out'. Internally, the module uses a local parameter 'WIDTH', set to a constant value of 2 which denotes the width of the input bus, though it does not directly impact the active logic in this version of the module. The primary logic is contained within an 'always' block that initially sets the entire 'out' register to 0 and then selectively sets the appropriate bit to 1 based on the formula `(in)*1+0-:1`. This formula dynamically calculates the bit slice wherein only the bit indexed by the input value 'in' is set to 1, effectively decoding the input to an active high output with concise logic.
