Module name: seven_seg_5. Module specification: The seven_seg_5 module is tailored for converting a 4-bit binary input into a corresponding 7-bit output to control a seven-segment display. This module features two ports: the input port 'char' which is a 4-bit value determining the pattern displayed by guiding which segments are illuminated, and the output port 'segs' which is a 7-bit register driving the individual segments of the display. The 'segs' register also doubles as an internal signal, storing the segment pattern based on the case-mapped value of 'char'. Within the module, a combinational logic block (defined with "always @*") utilizes a 'case' statement to map 'char' values to corresponding 'segs' patterns. For example, 'char' values from 0 to 8 are explicitly mapped to display patterns, while the "default" case turns all segments off (represented by 'segs' = 7'h00) to handle undefined or unexpected 'char' values. This specific design ensures clarity on the display by defining segment control for both foreseeable inputs and unaddressed cases.
