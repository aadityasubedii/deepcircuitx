The module takes a 16-bit input, `values`, which represents the numeric data to be displayed. It drives a 4-digit seven-segment display by selecting one digit at a time and providing the corresponding segments that need to be illuminated. The module uses a 2-bit counter (`counter_4`) to cycle through the digits (`DIGITS` parameter is set to 4), extracting 4-bit chunks from the `values` input to determine which number to display. A decoder (`seven_seg_5`) is used to convert these 4-bit values into 7-bit segment patterns that control the LEDs on the seven-segment display (`seg`). Additionally, a 2-to-4 decoder (`decoder_6`) is used to generate the selection signals for the digits (`sel`), ensuring only one digit is active at a time. This procedure repeats continuously, enabled by the clock signal `clk` and resettable by `rst`, to create the effect of a static multi-digit display."

It is used to drive the timing and control of the circuit, enabling synchronous operations such as digit selection and data loading for the seven-segment display.\n- **rst**: This is the reset signal input. It serves to initialize or reset the internal state and operational counters of the module to predefined values, ensuring a defined starting state.\n- **values**: This is a 16-bit input that holds the numerical data to be displayed on the multi-digit seven-segment display. Each group of 4 bits represents one digit, and the module processes this data to display up to four digits.\n\n### Output Ports:\n- **seg**: This 7-bit output controls the segments (A-G) of the currently selected digit in the seven-segment display. Each bit corresponds to a segment that can be turned on or off based on the decoded value of the 4-bit chunk from `values`.\n- **sel**: This 4-bit output selects which of the four digits on the seven-segment display is active at any given time. Only one digit is activated at a time, managed through a decoding process controlled by the internal 2-bit counter."

It is used to index through the digits, essentially selecting which digit's data (from the `values` input) to process and display next on the seven-segment display. \n- **M_seg_dec_segs**: A 7-bit signal received from the `seven_seg_5` decoder instance. It holds the segment configurations for the seven-segment display based on the value decoded from `M_seg_dec_char`. It directly maps to the `seg` output port to control the segments of the active digit.\n- **M_seg_dec_char**: A 4-bit signal that acts as an intermediate register to hold the current digit's value extracted from the `values` input. This value is decoded from every 4 bits of `values` sequenced by `M_ctr_value`.
