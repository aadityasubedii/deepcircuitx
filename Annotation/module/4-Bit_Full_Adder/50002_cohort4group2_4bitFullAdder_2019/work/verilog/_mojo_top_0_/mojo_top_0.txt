The `mojo_top_0` module functions as a digital logic tester, specifically verifying sum and carry operations based on user inputs across various pre-defined states. The module utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) to sequence through test states, employing internal signals for state control and outputs to LEDs and a seven-segment display to indicate test results. It integrates reset conditioning, state counting, and display control blocks to manage states and visualize outcomes effectively, making it robust for testing logic in sequential and combinational digital circuits.
