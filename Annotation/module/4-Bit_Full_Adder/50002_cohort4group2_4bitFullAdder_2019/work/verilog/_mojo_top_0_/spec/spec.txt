Module name: mojo_top_0. Module specification: The module `mojo_top_0` serves as a verification system for testing digital logic circuits, specifically sum and carry operations, using a predefined procedure driven by user inputs. Its functionality revolves around a finite state machine (FSM) that transitions through multiple test states to determine the correctness of these digital operations, indicating results through a series of LEDs and a seven-segment display. Input ports include `clk` (system clock), `rst_n` (active low reset), multiple SPI communication lines (`spi_ss`, `spi_mosi`, `spi_sck`, `spi_miso`), interaction controls (`avr_tx`, `avr_rx`, `avr_rx_busy`), user interface buttons (`io_button`), and configuration switches (`io_dip`). Results from tests (`sum` and `cout`) are also fed back as inputs to validate state transitions. Output ports control various indicators including general LEDs (`led`) and a more elaborate 24-bit LED output (`io_led`), segment selection (`io_sel`) for the display, data outputs (`a`, `b`, `cin`), and communications (`avr_rx`, `spi_miso`, `spi_channel`). Internally, `rst` is a managed reset signal derived through a reset conditioner (`reset_cond`). The module operates signals like `M_reset_cond_out`, `M_state_d`, `M_state_q` (managing state transitions), and `M_sc_inc_state` (incrementing through states). These components are linked with peripheral functionalities like segment display control (`multi_seven_seg_2`) and state transitions (`stateCounter_3`). The intricate, segmented approach allows for meticulous testing and visualization, moving from an IDLE state to a potential SUCCESS state, indicating valid logic, or a FAIL state, marking discrepancies in logical operations.
