Module name: reset_conditioner_1. Module specification: The reset_conditioner_1 module is crafted to groom a reset signal named 'in' synced with a clock 'clk'. This module hosts input ports namely 'clk', the clock input which triggers changes in the state of a shift register every positive edge, and 'in', a reset input signal influencing the behavior of the reset conditioning. Its sole output 'out' echoes the most significant bit of an internal shift register 'M_stage_q', delivering a refined, delayed reset signal. Internally, the module utilizes two registers: 'M_stage_d', a data register acting as a buffer storing the next state of 'M_stage_q' before update; and 'M_stage_q', a 4-bit shift register initialized to 4'hf, storing the history of reset input signals, which can either reset to 4'hf or shift right based on 'in's state. The Verilog code segregates into combinational logic, deciding the next state of 'M_stage_q' and output 'out' based on its current state, and sequential logic, updating 'M_stage_q' on each positive clock edge guided by 'in'. This module thereby aids in stabilizing and debouncing the reset input signal over several clock cycles, ensuring reliable system reset operations.
