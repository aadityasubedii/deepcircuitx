    "module": "The reset_conditioner_1 module conditions an input reset signal 'in' through a staged delay mechanism, ensuring stabilized and debounced output for system resets. It utilizes a 4-bit shift register 'M_stage_q' initialized to 4'hf, which shifts right or resets based on 'in'. The output 'out' reflects the most significant bit of 'M_stage_q', updated on every positive clock edge 'clk', capturing the sequential reaction to 'in'."
