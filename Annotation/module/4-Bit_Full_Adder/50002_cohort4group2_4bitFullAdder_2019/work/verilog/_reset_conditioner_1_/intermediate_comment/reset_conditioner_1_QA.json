It works by passing the reset signal through a shift register (M_stage_q) of 4 stages, initialized to 4'hf. Every positive clock edge, if the input 'in' is high (1'b1), it resets the shift register to 4'hf. If 'in' is low, it shifts the content of the register right by 1 bit, filling the most significant bit with 0. The output 'out' reflects the most significant bit of the shift register M_stage_q, effectively creating a delayed reaction to the input reset condition, which helps in stabilizing and debouncing the input signal condition over a span of clock cycles."

It is intermediate storage in the combinational logic part that facilitates the synthesis of the appropriate sequential behavior within the module.\n- M_stage_q: This is the main shift register within the module. It is initialized to 4'hf and is used to store the historical values of the reset input 'in' across multiple clock cycles. Based on the condition of 'in', it either gets reset to 4'hf or shifted right by one position each clock cycle, with the shifted-in value being '0'.
