    "module": "The 'counter_4' module is a Verilog digital counter that increments every clock cycle and resets upon reaching the maximum value (20'h3ffff) or when a reset signal is high. It outputs a 2-bit value representing bits 16 and 17 of the internal counter. Internally, it uses a register 'M_ctr_q' to store the current counter value and another 'M_ctr_d' for the next state, which are updated with each clock edge based on the counter operations defined in the combinational logic block and the clock-driven sequential block."
