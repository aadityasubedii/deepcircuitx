Module name: counter_4. Module specification: The 'counter_4' module is a Verilog-based counter that operates on a 20-bit range, incrementing each clock cycle and resetting when it reaches the predefined maximum value of 20'h3ffff or when a high reset signal is detected. The module has two input ports: 'clk', which is the clock input for synchronization of the counter's operations, and 'rst', a reset input that when high, clears the counter to zero. It features a single 2-bit output port 'value', which expresses bits 16 and 17 of the current counter value, offering a view into a specific slice of the counterâ€™s state. Internally, the module utilizes two signals: 'M_ctr_d' and 'M_ctr_q'. 'M_ctr_d' serves as the next-state storage during the combinational logic evaluation before being transferred to 'M_ctr_q' at the next positive clock edge. 'M_ctr_q' holds the current counter value and updates based on 'M_ctr_d' or resets to zero depending on the state of 'rst'. The module code is divided into two main blocks: a combinational logic block that determines the next state of the counter and outputs the 'value', and a sequential logic block that updates or resets the counter based on the clock and reset signals.
