Module name: multi_seven_seg_2. 
Module specification: The `multi_seven_seg_2` module is designed to manage the display of numerical values on a multi-digit seven-segment display, driven by a 16-bit input `values`. Each 4-bit segment (nibble) of `values` represents a number to be displayed on one of the four digits of the seven-segment display. The module uses an input `clk` for clock synchronization, and an input `rst` to reset the module's state. Outputs include `seg`, a 7-bit output controlling individual segments of the currently active display digit, and `sel`, a 4-bit output determining which digit is currently active. Internally, a 2-bit signal `M_ctr_value` from the `counter_4` named `ctr` identifies the index of the current active digit. `M_seg_dec_char`, a register holding a 4-bit value extracted from `values`, determines the character to be displayed; this is decoded into the seven-segment format by `M_seg_dec_segs` from the `seven_seg_5` named `seg_dec`. A further decoder, `decoder_6` named `digit_dec`, uses `M_digit_dec_in` set to `M_ctr_value` to generate select outputs (`M_digit_dec_out`), which are used to activate the correct display digit via the `sel` output. The functionality of the module splits into key block operations: driving display segment logistics and decoding the digit to be displayed, with synchronization managed by the `clk` input.
