It receives a 16-bit input (`values`), which represents the numeric values to be displayed. The module includes a 4-bit counter (`counter_4`) named `ctr` that cycles through the digits (0 to 3). Each digit of the input `values` is decoded into segments by the `seven_seg_5` module named `seg_dec` to drive a 7-segment display, and a decoder (`decoder_6` named `digit_dec`) that generates the select signals for each digit (`sel`). This setup allows the module to dynamically display each digit on a 4-digit seven-segment display by cycling through and activating the appropriate segments and select lines based on the clock input `clk`. The outputs are `seg`, which represents the segments of the currently active digit, and `sel`, which selects which digit is active."

When `rst` is asserted (typically high), it resets the internal components such as counters.\n- `values`: This is a 16-bit input which represents the numeric values to be displayed on the seven-segment display. Each 4-bit group (nibble) corresponds to a single digit.\n\nOutput ports: `seg`, `sel`. \nExplanation:\n- `seg`: This 7-bit output represents the segments of the currently active digit on a seven-segment display. Each bit turns on a specific segment of the display (a-g).\n- `sel`: This 4-bit output selects which of the four digits on the multi-digit seven-segment display is currently active. Typically, a high signal on one of these bits will select the corresponding digit to show the value represented by the `seg` output."

It serves as a digit selector by holding the value of the current digit's index (ranging from 0 to 3). This index is used to select which 4-bit chunk of the `values` input to decode and display.\n- `M_seg_dec_segs`: Connected to the `segs` output of the `seven_seg_5` module (`seg_dec`). This 7-bit signal represents the segments that should be activated on the seven-segment display to represent the current digit character.\n- `M_seg_dec_char`: This is a register used to supply the `char` input of the `seven_seg_5` module (`seg_dec`). It holds the 4-bit value that represents the current digit to be shown on the display, extracted from the `values` input based on the `M_ctr_value`.\n- `M_digit_dec_out`: Connected to the `out` output of the `decoder_6` module (`digit_dec`). This 4-bit signal is used to generate the select signals (`sel` output) for the digits on the seven-segment display, selecting which digit is currently active.\n- `M_digit_dec_in`: A register used to supply the `in` input of the `decoder_6` module (`digit_dec`).
