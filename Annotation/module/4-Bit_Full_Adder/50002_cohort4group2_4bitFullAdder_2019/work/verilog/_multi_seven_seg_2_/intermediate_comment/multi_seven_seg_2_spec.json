    "spec": "Module name: multi_seven_seg_2. \nModule specification: The `multi_seven_seg_2` module is designed to manage the display of numerical values on a multi-digit seven-segment display, driven by a 16-bit input `values`. Each 4-bit segment (nibble) of `values` represents a number to be displayed on one of the four digits of the seven-segment display. The module uses an input `clk` for clock synchronization, and an input `rst` to reset the module's state. Outputs include `seg`, a 7-bit output controlling individual segments of the currently active display digit, and `sel`, a 4-bit output determining which digit is currently active. Internally, a 2-bit signal `M_ctr_value` from the `counter_4` named `ctr` identifies the index of the current active digit. `M_seg_dec_char`, a register holding a 4-bit value extracted from `values`, determines the character to be displayed; this is decoded into the seven-segment format by `M_seg_dec_segs` from the `seven_seg_5` named `seg_dec`. A further decoder, `decoder_6` named `digit_dec`, uses `M_digit_dec_in` set to `M_ctr_value` to generate select outputs (`M_digit_dec_out`), which are used to activate the correct display digit via the `sel` output. The functionality of the module splits into key block operations: driving display segment logistics and decoding the digit to be displayed, with synchronization managed by the `clk` input.",

It receives a 16-bit input (`values`), which represents the numeric values to be displayed. The module includes a 4-bit counter (`counter_4`) named `ctr` that cycles through the digits (0 to 3).

This setup allows the module to dynamically display each digit on a 4-digit seven-segment display by cycling through and activating the appropriate segments and select lines based on the clock input `clk`. The outputs are `seg`, which represents the segments of the currently active digit, and `sel`, which selects which digit is active."

When `rst` is asserted (typically high), it resets the internal components such as counters.\n- `values`: This is a 16-bit input which represents the numeric values to be displayed on the seven-segment display. Each 4-bit group (nibble) corresponds to a single digit.\n\nOutput ports: `seg`, `sel`. \nExplanation:\n- `seg`: This 7-bit output represents the segments of the currently active digit on a seven-segment display. Each bit turns on a specific segment of the display (a-g).\n- `sel`: This 4-bit output selects which of the four digits on the multi-digit seven-segment display is currently active.

It serves as a digit selector by holding the value of the current digit's index (ranging from 0 to 3). This index is used to select which 4-bit chunk of the `values` input to decode and display.\n- `M_seg_dec_segs`: Connected to the `segs` output of the `seven_seg_5` module (`seg_dec`). This 7-bit signal represents the segments that should be activated on the seven-segment display to represent the current digit character.\n- `M_seg_dec_char`: This is a register used to supply the `char` input of the `seven_seg_5` module (`seg_dec`). It holds the 4-bit value that represents the current digit to be shown on the display, extracted from the `values` input based on the `M_ctr_value`.\n- `M_digit_dec_out`: Connected to the `out` output of the `decoder_6` module (`digit_dec`). This 4-bit signal is used to generate the select signals (`sel` output) for the digits on the seven-segment display, selecting which digit is currently active.\n- `M_digit_dec_in`: A register used to supply the `in` input of the `decoder_6` module (`digit_dec`).
