    "module": "The `multi_seven_seg_2` module drives a multi-digit seven-segment display by decoding a 16-bit input into individual digits displayed sequentially. It utilizes a counter to cycle through digits (0-3), decoding each 4-bit segment of the input to control the seven-segment outputs and using a decoder to select the active digit. This synchronization and control of display elements are achieved via clock and reset inputs, ensuring dynamic and accurate representation of values on the display."
