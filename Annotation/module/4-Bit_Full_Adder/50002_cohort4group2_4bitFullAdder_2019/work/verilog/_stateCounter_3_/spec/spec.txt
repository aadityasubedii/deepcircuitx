Module name: stateCounter_3.  
Module specification: The `stateCounter_3` module is a 27-bit counter circuit constructed using Verilog, primarily managing an incrementing operation with a special conditional reset feature. It increments the counter value `M_stateCounter_q` on every positive edge of the clock input `clk` unless the reset input `rst` is asserted. If `rst` is high, the counter synchronously resets to 0. The module is equipped with an output `inc_state`, which reflects the most significant bit (MSB) of the counter. When `inc_state` is high, it indicates that the MSB of the counter has reached a significant value, specifically triggering a reset of the MSB in the subsequent cycle. Internally, `M_stateCounter_d` holds the next state of the counter (incremented or modified based on the MSB). The key sections of the code include two procedural blocks: The combinational logic block (`always @*`) computes the next counter state (`M_stateCounter_d`) and outputs (`inc_state`), checking and acting upon the MSB's condition. The sequential logic block (`always @(posedge clk)`) manages the counter's state update or reset based on the clock and reset conditions. This structure provides functional clarity and a stable operation of the counter through cycles, ensuring accurate tracking and manipulation of the state based on given inputs and internal conditions.
