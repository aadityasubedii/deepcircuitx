The module outputs a signal `inc_state` which is a reflection of the most significant bit of the counter `M_stateCounter_q`. When this bit is high (1'b1), the output `inc_state` is also high, and the counter's most significant bit is reset to zero in the next state. If `rst` is asserted high, the counter resets to 0."

This signal can be used externally to indicate that the counter has cycled through its counting sequence and has reached a significant value (when the most significant bit is high). When `inc_state` is high, it also triggers the resetting of the most significant bit of the counter to 0 in the next logical step."

It stores the value of the counter across clock cycles until it is updated with the value of `M_stateCounter_d` on every positive clock edge if the reset is not active.\n- `M_stateCounter_d` is also a 27-bit register that holds the next state of the counter. It's calculated in every cycle as an increment of `M_stateCounter_q`. When the most significant bit of `M_stateCounter_q` is high, `M_stateCounter_d` ensures the most significant bit is cleared to zero, thereby modifying the counter's next state while maintaining other bits incremented as usual. This next state value `M_stateCounter_d` is loaded into `M_stateCounter_q` on the subsequent clock edge, given that the reset isn't asserted."
