The `stateCounter_3` module functions as a 27-bit counter that increments with each positive clock edge and outputs the state of its most significant bit (MSB). Implementation utilizes two main blocks: a combinational logic block calculates the next state and manages the MSB based on its current state, and a sequential block that updates the counter or resets it based on the clock and reset signal, ensuring orderly, predictable counting and conditional resetting of the MSB.
