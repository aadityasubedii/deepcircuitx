The 'decoder_6' module functions as a 2-to-4 decoder, taking a 2-bit binary input and converting it into a 4-bit output where only one bit is set to '1' based on the input's decimal value. This is achieved through an 'always' combinational block that initializes the output to zero and selectively sets the appropriate output bit high, calculating the set bit position directly from the input value.
