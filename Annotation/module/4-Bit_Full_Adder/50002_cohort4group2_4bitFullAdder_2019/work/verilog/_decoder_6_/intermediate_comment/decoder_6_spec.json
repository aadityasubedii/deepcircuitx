    "spec": "Module name: decoder_6. Module specification: The module 'decoder_6' is a 2-to-4 binary decoder implemented in Verilog, designed to take a 2-bit binary input and generate a 4-bit output with only one of the bits set to high ('1'). The high output bit corresponds to the decimal equivalent of the binary input value. The module comprises an input port 'in' which is a 2-bit wide binary input used to determine which of the four output bits is set to '1'. It also includes an output port 'out' which is a 4-bit wide binary output that shows one bit high based on the input. The module features an internal signal defined as a local parameter, 'WIDTH', set to 2'h2 (or 2 in decimal); however, this parameter is not utilized in the current module operation. Within the provided source code, the primary functional block is an 'always' block which initializes the output to 0 and thereafter sets the specific output bit to '1' based on the given input. The way the output bit is addressed uses the input value directly to calculate the index of the high bit, following a straightforward and effective decoding strategy.",
