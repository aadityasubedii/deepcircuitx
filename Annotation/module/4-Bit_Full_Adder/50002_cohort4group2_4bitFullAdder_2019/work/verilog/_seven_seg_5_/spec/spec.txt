Module name: seven_seg_5. 
Module specification: The seven_seg_5 module in Verilog is designed to interface with a seven-segment display by mapping a 4-bit binary input (char) to a 7-bit output (segs) that controls which segments are illuminated. The input port, 'char', is a 4-bit signal that selects numerals from 0 to 8 to be displayed; for values outside this range, all segments are turned off. The output port, 'segs', is a 7-bit signal where each bit corresponds to one of the seven segments of the display (labeled A to G). Internally, 'segs' is managed as a 7-bit register and is updated through a combinational always block depending on the value of 'char'. This update is driven by a case statement, which sets the 'segs' pattern for each numeral or the off state. The design effectively decodes binary input into segment control for displaying numbers on a seven-segment module, covering basic numeral representations and an off state for erroneous or out-of-bound inputs.
