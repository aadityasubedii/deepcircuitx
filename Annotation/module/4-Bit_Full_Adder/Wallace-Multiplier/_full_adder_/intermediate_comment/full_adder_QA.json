Internally, it uses two instances of a `half_adder`. The first `half_adder` (ha1) processes the inputs `a` and `b` generating an intermediate sum `s0` and carry `c1`. The second `half_adder` (ha2) then takes this intermediate sum `s0` and the carry in `cin` from the input, producing the final sum `sum` and another carry `c2`. An OR gate combines the carries `c1` and `c2` to produce the final carry out `cout`. This module efficiently adds three bits by breaking down the addition into simpler half adder operations and combining their results."

These inputs represent the smallest units of data (bits) that will be added together.\n\nOutput ports: sum, cout.\nExplanation: The output `sum` provides the binary result of the addition of the three input bits. The `cout` (carry out) outputs a binary value which represents an overflow of the sum beyond a single bit, acting as the carry-out bit. This carry-out can be used as a carry-in for an subsequent higher-order addition in cascaded or multi-bit adder configurations."
