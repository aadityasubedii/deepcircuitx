    "spec": "Module name: full_adder. Module specification: The `full_adder` module is designed for performing binary addition of three input bits: `a`, `b`, and `cin` (carry in), to produce a `sum` and a `cout` (carry out). The inputs `a` and `b` are single-bit binary values and `cin` is the carry-in bit needed for cascaded addition operations. Outputs include `sum`, which is the binary result of the addition, and `cout`, representing any overflow from the sum as a carry-out bit for higher-order additions. The module utilizes internal signals `s0`, `c1`, and `c2` for intermediate calculations: `s0` holds the partial sum from the first half adder (`ha1`), `c1` is the carry from `ha1`, and `c2` is the carry from the second half adder (`ha2`). The full_adder comprises two instances of `half_adder`: `ha1` processes `a` and `b`, while `ha2` handles `s0` and `cin`. An OR gate combines `c1` and `c2` to generate the final carry-out `cout`. This modular design breaks down the full addition into simpler operations, efficiently managing bit-level additions.",

These inputs represent the smallest units of data (bits) that will be added together.\n\nOutput ports: sum, cout.\nExplanation: The output `sum` provides the binary result of the addition of the three input bits.

This carry-out can be used as a carry-in for an subsequent higher-order addition in cascaded or multi-bit adder configurations."
