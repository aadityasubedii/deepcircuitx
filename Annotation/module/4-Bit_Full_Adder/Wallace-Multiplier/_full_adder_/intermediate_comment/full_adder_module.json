    "module": "The `full_adder` module performs binary addition of three input bits (`a`, `b`, `cin`) by outputting a sum (`sum`) and a carry-out (`cout`). It utilizes two half_adders to compute the intermediary sum (`s0`) and carries (`c1`, `c2`), and an OR gate to combine the carries, effectively allowing cascaded addition operations in larger architectures."
