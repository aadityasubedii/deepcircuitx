    "spec": "Module name: half_adder. Module specification: The \"half_adder\" module is designed to perform basic binary addition on two single-bit input operands, generating two single-bit outputs: the sum and the carry. The input ports are 'a' and 'b', which are binary signals that serve as the operands for the addition operation. The output ports are 's' (sum) and 'c' (carry). The sum 's' is calculated using a bitwise XOR operation on inputs 'a' and 'b', yielding the sum of the two bits without their carry. The carry 'c' results from a bitwise AND operation on the same inputs, representing the carry-out from the addition process. This carry is crucial for multi-bit adder circuits where carry propagation is necessary. Internally, the module does not utilize any intermediate signals or storage elements; it directly assigns the computed values to the outputs. The code comprises two main assign statements: one for calculating the sum and the other for determining the carry. This efficient structure ensures clear understanding and simple integration into more complex digital systems.",
