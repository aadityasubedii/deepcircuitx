It takes two binary inputs, represented by 'a' and 'b', and produces two binary outputs: 's' (sum) and 'c' (carry). The sum output 's' is calculated using the XOR (^) operation on inputs 'a' and 'b', which gives the sum without the carry. The carry output 'c' is derived from the AND (&) operation on the same inputs, representing the carry-out from the addition, which is used when this module is combined in larger arithmetic circuits for carry propagation."
