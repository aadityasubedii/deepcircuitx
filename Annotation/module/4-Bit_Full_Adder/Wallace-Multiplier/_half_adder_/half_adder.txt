The half_adder module performs basic binary addition of two single-bit inputs, 'a' and 'b', producing a sum 's' and a carry 'c'. It calculates the sum using a bitwise XOR operation and the carry using a bitwise AND operation between the inputs, directly outputting these results without using intermediate signals.
