The 'wallace_tree' module multiplies two 4-bit binary numbers using the Wallace Tree algorithm, efficiently producing an 8-bit result 'prod'. It employs internal partial products derived from bitwise AND operations and utilizes structured stages of half-adders and full-adders to minimize computation delay by handling sum and carry operations effectively across different levels, ultimately streamlining the digital multiplication process.
