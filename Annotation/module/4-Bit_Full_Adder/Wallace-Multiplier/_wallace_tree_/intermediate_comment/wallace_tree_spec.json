    "spec": "Module name: wallace_tree.\nModule specification: The 'wallace_tree' module is a hardware implementation designed to multiply two 4-bit binary numbers, A and B, using the Wallace Tree algorithm, and produces an 8-bit output 'prod'. The inputs, 'A' and 'B', are each 4-bit binary numbers that signify the multipliers. The output 'prod' is an 8-bit binary number representing the product of A and B obtained through multiple stages of additions using partial products. Internally, this module uses signals such as 'p0' to 'p3' to represent partial products of the multiplication. These products are generated by ANDing A with each replicated bit of B. The sums 's01' to 's24' and carries 'c01' to 'c24' are generated using half and full adders, ensuring the correct sum and carry forwarding at each level of addition. There are distinct blocks within the code: initialization of partial products, connections to produce the 'prod' output, and various stages grouped by half-adders and full-adders that progressively sum the partial products and carries to form the final product. This structured addition significantly reduces the adder depth, optimizing the multiplication speed and minimizing delay in digital circuits.",

The product of A and B is stored in an 8-bit output called 'prod'. The module utilizes a series of half adders and full adders to progressively sum and carry bits from partial products (p0 to p3), generated by ANDing A with each bit of B shifted respectively. These partial products are structured into a tree where combined results produce the final product. This arrangement allows for a faster multiplication process compared to a standard long multiplication approach, due to reduced adder depth and thus lower propagation delay in the circuit."
