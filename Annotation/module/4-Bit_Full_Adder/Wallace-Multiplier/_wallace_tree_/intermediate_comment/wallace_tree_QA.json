The product of A and B is stored in an 8-bit output called 'prod'. The module utilizes a series of half adders and full adders to progressively sum and carry bits from partial products (p0 to p3), generated by ANDing A with each bit of B shifted respectively. These partial products are structured into a tree where combined results produce the final product. This arrangement allows for a faster multiplication process compared to a standard long multiplication approach, due to reduced adder depth and thus lower propagation delay in the circuit."
