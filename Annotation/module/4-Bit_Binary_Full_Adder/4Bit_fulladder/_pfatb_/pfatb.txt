Module-level comment: The 'pfatb' module serves as a testbench for a parallel full adder 'pfa'. It drives test patterns onto 'pfa' inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin', and observes outputs 'sum' and 'carry'. Functionality is verified through clock-driven simulation with varying inputs to ensure all arithmetic combinations are tested. Internal register toggling and a time-bound simulation stop after 500ns are implemented to complete the test sequence.
