Module name: pfatb. Module specification: The 'pfatb' module is a testbench designed to simulate and verify the functionality of the 'pfa' module, which is a parallel full adder. This testbench uses input ports such as a 4-bit operands 'a' and 'b', a carry-in bit 'cin', along with a clock signal 'clk' and a reset signal 'rst'. The outputs are a 4-bit sum 'sum' and a 4-bit carry 'carry'. The internal signals include 'clk' for syncing operations, 'rst' for initializing the state of the device under test, 'a' and 'b' as the operands for addition, and 'cin' for inputting carry from previous stages. In terms of functionality, the module initializes 'clk' to generate events every 20ns, controls 'rst' to set up the initial state, and provides toggling test inputs for 'a', 'b', and 'cin' to fully test the adder's response under varying conditions. The simulation ends after 500 time units, ensuring comprehensive behaviour analysis. The module incorporates several initial blocks to set initial conditions and drive the clock, along with always blocks that continuously toggle input signals to test different arithmetic scenarios.
