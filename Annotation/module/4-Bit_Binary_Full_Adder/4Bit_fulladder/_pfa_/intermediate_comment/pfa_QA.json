The addition operation produces a 4-bit sum 'sum' and a 4-bit carry-out 'carry'. This module processes the addition in a pipelined manner, which implies that input operands and output results are registered (delayed by one clock cycle) to increase throughput in a circuit with a clock. It has an asynchronous reset 'rst' which, when asserted, clears the registers and outputs. The addition is computed by an instantiated submodule 'pipefulladder' with the output being registered on each rising edge of the clock 'clk', as long as reset is not asserted."
