Module name: fulladderfour. 
Module specification: The `fulladderfour` module encapsulates the functionality of a full adder logic circuit in digital electronics, designed to perform binary addition on two significant bits along with a carry-in bit. The module is equipped with three input ports: `a` and `b`, which represent the two significant binary bits to be added, and `cin`, serving as the carry-in from a previous addition stage. This design facilitates the chaining of multiple full adder circuits for multi-bit binary addition. The outputs of the module are two ports: `sum` and `carry`. The `sum` port produces the result of the binary addition, achieved through a bitwise XOR operation among the inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin`, effectively adding these three binary digits together. On the other hand, the `carry` output is generated by evaluating the OR operation on all possible conjunctions of the input pairs (`a&b`, `b&cin`, `a&cin`), which identifies if a carry-out occurs as a result of the addition, a crucial component for cascading in multi-bit adder configurations. Internally, the `fulladderfour` module does not utilize any additional signals such as registers or wires for intermediate computations or storage, illustrating a direct and efficient logic implementation. The complete functionality of the module is succinctly encapsulated through assignment statements directly mapping inputs to outputs without the delineation of separate internal blocks or sections, underscoring the module's streamlined and straightforward design.
