    "module": "Module-level comment: The `fulladderfour` module implements a full adder for binary addition of two significant bits and a carry-in. It uses XOR to compute the `sum` and OR operations of conjunctions of the inputs to determine the `carry-out`. This design allows for simple chaining in multi-bit adder systems, directly mapping inputs to outputs efficiently without intermediate signals."
