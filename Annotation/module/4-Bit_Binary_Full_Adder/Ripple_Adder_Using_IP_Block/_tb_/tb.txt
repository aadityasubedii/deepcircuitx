Module-level comment: The "tb" module is a testbench for validating a Ripple carry adder, "Ripple_adder_design_wrapper". It drives a 4-bit operand 'A' through values 0-15, while 'B' receives random 4-bit values. With 'Cin' fixed at 0, it tests the adder's sum ('s0'-'s3') and carry-out ('Cout') outputs across combinations, using a for-loop in an initial block for sequential and randomized input application.
