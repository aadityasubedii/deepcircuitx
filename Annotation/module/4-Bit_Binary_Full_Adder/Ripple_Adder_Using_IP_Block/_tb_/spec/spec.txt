Module name: tb. Module specification: The "tb" module is designed as a testbench for the Ripple carry adder implemented inside the "Ripple_adder_design_wrapper". It is responsible for systematically testing the adder by driving test vectors through it. The module uses two 4-bit input ports, 'A' and 'B', and one single-bit input 'Cin', which is initialized to 0. 'A' is sequenced through values 0 to 15, while 'B' takes on random values from the same range, ensuring comprehensive testing through varying input combinations. The outputs from the adder are a single-bit carry-out 'Cout' and four single-bit sum outputs 's0', 's1', 's2', and 's3', which together form the 4-bit sum. Internally, 'Cin' serves as the carry-in for all operations, constantly set to 0 as it is unchanging in this test case, and 'Cout', 's0', 's1', 's2', 's3' help monitor the adder's output for correctness. The code features a loop inside an initial block which iterates over possible values for 'A', assigns random values to 'B', and simulates time to observe outputs. This testbench effectively evaluates the Ripple_adder_design_wrapperâ€™s ability to handle different input combinations and propagate carries correctly.
