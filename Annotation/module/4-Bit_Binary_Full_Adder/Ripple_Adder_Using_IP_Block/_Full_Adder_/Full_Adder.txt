Module-level comment: The Full_Adder module performs single-bit binary addition of three inputs: A, B, and Cin. It outputs the sum S and the carry-out Co. The sum S is computed using a bitwise XOR operation across all inputs. Carry-out Co is calculated either when both A and B are high, or when an intermediate result (A XOR B) and Cin both indicate a carry. This module achieves its functionality directly through continuous assignment statements without intermediate signals, thereby optimizing efficiency and simplicity in hardware modeling.
