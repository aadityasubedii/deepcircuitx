    "spec": "Module name: Full_Adder. Module specification: The Full_Adder module is a fundamental digital logic component implemented in Verilog, designed to compute the sum and carry-out of three single-bit binary inputs: A, B, and Cin. These inputs, A and B, are the binary operands, while Cin serves as the carry-in bit from a previous addition stage. The module outputs two bits: S and Co. The output S, or sum, is calculated through a bitwise XOR operation across all three inputs, effectively summing them. The carry-out, Co, is generated under two conditions: either both inputs A and B are high (1), indicating a carry, or when the intermediate result of A XOR B and the carry-in, Cin, together necessitate a carry. Internally, the module does not utilize any intermediary signals; the operations are directly computed using input assignments to the outputs. The source code comprises initialization of the module and continuous assignment statements for calculating outputs directly from the given inputs without intermediate stages. This structure ensures a straightforward implementation of a full adder with minimal internal complexity.",

The full adder outputs a sum bit (S) and a carry-out bit (Co). The sum S is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the three input bits A, B, and Cin. Meanwhile, the carry-out Co is determined by two conditions: it is set if either A and B are both 1 (indicating a need for a carry), or if the intermediate result of A XOR B also requires a carry as indicated by Cin. The carry-out thus accounts for an overflow condition where the result exceeds the capacity of a single-bit representation."
