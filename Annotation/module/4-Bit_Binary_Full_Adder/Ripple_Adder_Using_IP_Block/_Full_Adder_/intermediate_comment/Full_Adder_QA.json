The full adder outputs a sum bit (S) and a carry-out bit (Co). The sum S is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the three input bits A, B, and Cin. Meanwhile, the carry-out Co is determined by two conditions: it is set if either A and B are both 1 (indicating a need for a carry), or if the intermediate result of A XOR B also requires a carry as indicated by Cin. The carry-out thus accounts for an overflow condition where the result exceeds the capacity of a single-bit representation."
