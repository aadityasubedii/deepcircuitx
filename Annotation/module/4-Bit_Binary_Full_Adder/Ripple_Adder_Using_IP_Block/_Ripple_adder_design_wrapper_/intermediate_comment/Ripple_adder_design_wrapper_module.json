    "module": "Module-level comment: The Ripple_adder_design_wrapper is a 4-bit adder module that encapsulates the Ripple_adder_design for adding two 4-bit vectors A and B, with a carry-in bit Cin. It outputs a 4-bit sum (s0-s3) and a carry-out bit Cout. This wrapper module interfaces with the Ripple_adder_design by directly connecting input and output ports to the internal module instance, ensuring straightforward addition logic encapsulation."
