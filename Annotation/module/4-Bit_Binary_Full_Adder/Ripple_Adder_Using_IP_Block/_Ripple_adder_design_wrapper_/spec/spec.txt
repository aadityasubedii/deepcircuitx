Module name: Ripple_adder_design_wrapper. Module specification: The Ripple_adder_design_wrapper is a Verilog module designed to perform a 4-bit addition using another module named Ripple_adder_design. It accepts two 4-bit binary numbers A and B along with a carry-in bit Cin, and outputs a 4-bit sum with bits s0 (least significant) through s3 (most significant), and a carry-out bit Cout. The input ports include [A, B, Cin], where 'A' and 'B' are 4-bit vectors representing the numbers to be added, and 'Cin' is used for cascading multiple adders or representing carry from a less significant addition. The output ports consist of [Cout, s0, s1, s2, s3], where 'Cout' is the carry-out bit used for overflow detection or chaining, and 's0' to 's3' represent the resulting sum bits. Within the module, internal signals such as [A, B, Cin, Cout, s0, s1, s2, s3] serve as direct connections from the inputs and outputs to the internal instance of Ripple_adder_design, simplifying the wiring and ensuring correct functionality. The code structure distinctly separates the declaration of input and output ports, specifies wire connections, and instantiates the Ripple_adder_design module, clearly mapping all inputs and outputs to ensure proper operation of the addition process.
