The Ripple_Adder_Using_IP_Block repository is dedicated to showcasing the design and implementation of a 4-bit ripple carry adder using Verilog modules. The repository contains three main components: the Ripple_adder_design_wrapper, the Full_Adder, and the testbench module "tb". The Ripple_adder_design_wrapper serves as an encapsulating module that interfaces with the internal Ripple_adder_design to perform addition of two 4-bit vectors along with a carry-in bit, directly connecting the input and output ports to produce a 4-bit sum and a carry-out bit. The Full_Adder module is responsible for performing single-bit binary addition using bitwise operations and continuous assignment statements, focusing on efficiency and simplicity to determine both sum and carry-out based on the logic state of inputs. Finally, the "tb" module functions as a testbench to validate the ripple carry adder operated by Ripple_adder_design_wrapper, utilizing a for-loop in an initial block to systematically test various combinations of binary inputs for thorough verification of the adder's functionality.
