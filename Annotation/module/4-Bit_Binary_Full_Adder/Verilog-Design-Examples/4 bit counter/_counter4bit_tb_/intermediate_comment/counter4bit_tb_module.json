    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'counter4bit_tb' module is a testbench for verifying the 'counter4bit' 4-bit counter. It begins with generating a clock signal and manipulating 'reset', 'load', and 'enable' inputs to test counter responses. Through a sequence driven by 'new_count' and parameter checks against 'count_out', the module validates the counter's functionality under various scenarios, outputting pass or fail based on the results, and ends the simulation after predetermined operations."
