It responds to a clock signal (clk), and optionally to a reset signal that initializes the count, a load signal that enables the counting operation, and an enable signal that must be high for the count to proceed. The counter outputs a 4-bit number that follows a predefined sequence of states (S0 to S13) as it counts, rather than a simple binary count. If the reset signal is asserted high, the output count is set to the initial state (S0). When both the load and enable signals are high, the counter transitions through its specific sequence on each rising edge of the clock. If the load signal is low, the count is reset to S0, and if the enable signal is low, the count_out remains at its current state until the enable signal is high again."

If deasserted (low), the counter is reset to the initial state S0 regardless of the enable signal.\n- enable: When asserted (high), this signal enables the counter to transition to the next state in the sequence. If deasserted (low), the counter holds its current value.\n- clk: This is the clock input. The counter is sensitive to the positive edge of this signal, progressing through its sequence or getting reset based on the other input signals' states.\n\nOutput ports: count_out, count.\nExplanation: \n- count_out: This 4-bit register holds the current state of the counter. It gets updated on the rising edge of the clock, either to the initial state S0 (if reset is high) or to the value stored in count after the case evaluation.\n- count: This 4-bit register is the next state of the counter.
