    "spec": "Module name: counter4bit. Module specification: The counter4bit module is designed to implement a 4-bit counter that progresses through a pre-defined non-binary sequence of states (from S0 to S13) in response to a clock signal and controlled by reset, load, and enable signals. The inputs to the module include reset, an active-high synchronous signal which sets the counter output (count_out) to the initial state S0; load, which when high allows the counter to transition to the next state and when low resets the count_out to S0; enable, which must be high for the counter to transition states; and clk, the clock signal which triggers state transitions on its rising edge. The outputs are count_out, a 4-bit register holding the current counter state that updates each clock cycle based on the input conditions; and count, a 4-bit register that stores the next state count_out will take if conditions permit. Internally, count_out acts as the current state register, while count is used to compute the next state based on current state and inputs. The code consists of two main procedural blocks triggered by the rising edge of the clk: the first block handles the synchronous reset and the updating of count_out from count unless reset is asserted, and the second block handles the state transitions based on the load and enable conditions, employing a case statement to select the appropriate next state from the sequence, or reset count to S0 if load is deasserted. If enable is deasserted, count_out retains its current state until enable is high again. The sequence and transitions are defined using parameters from S0 to S13, facilitating easy updates to the sequence of states.",

It responds to a clock signal (clk), and optionally to a reset signal that initializes the count, a load signal that enables the counting operation, and an enable signal that must be high for the count to proceed. The counter outputs a 4-bit number that follows a predefined sequence of states (S0 to S13) as it counts, rather than a simple binary count. If the reset signal is asserted high, the output count is set to the initial state (S0). When both the load and enable signals are high, the counter transitions through its specific sequence on each rising edge of the clock. If the load signal is low, the count is reset to S0, and if the enable signal is low, the count_out remains at its current state until the enable signal is high again."

If deasserted (low), the counter is reset to the initial state S0 regardless of the enable signal.\n- enable: When asserted (high), this signal enables the counter to transition to the next state in the sequence.
