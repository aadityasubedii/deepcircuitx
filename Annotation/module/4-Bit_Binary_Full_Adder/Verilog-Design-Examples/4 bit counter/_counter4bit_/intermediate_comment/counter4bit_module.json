    "module": "Module-level comment: The counter4bit module implements a 4-bit sequence counter with non-binary progression through predefined states (S0 to S13). It updates on the rising edge of the clock (clk), with a reset setting the output (count_out) to S0. Using load and enable signals, the next state (count) is determined; if load is low, count resets to S0, and if enable is low, count_out remains unchanged. State transitions are managed using case statements based on current state values."
