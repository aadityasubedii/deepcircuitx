Module-level comment: The syncfifo module implements a synchronous FIFO buffer with 8 elements, each 8 bits wide, controlled by a clock and active-low reset. It features write and read operations, managed by `write_en` and `read_en`. Internally, it uses an array `memory_vec` for storage, `write_pointer` and `read_pointer` for indexing, and `count` for tracking stored elements. Write and read operations are handled in separate always blocks, which also manage pointers and count updates to ensure data integrity and prevent overflow and underflow.
