It supports data inputs (`data_in`) and provides an output (`out`). The FIFO has a capacity to store 8 elements, each 8 bits wide, as defined by an internal memory vector (`memory_vec`). It has two main operations: write and read, controlled by `write_en` and `read_en` signals, respectively. The FIFO maintains a `count` of the elements currently stored, and provides two status signals, `full` and `empty`, indicating when the FIFO is full or empty, respectively. Writing to the FIFO increments the `write_pointer` and the `count` if it's not `full`, while reading from it increments the `read_pointer` and decrements the `count` if it's not `empty`. The operations are carefully controlled to ensure data integrity and prevent overflows or underflows."

Used to reset the FIFO pointers and count to their initial state.\n- `write_en`: Write enable signal.
