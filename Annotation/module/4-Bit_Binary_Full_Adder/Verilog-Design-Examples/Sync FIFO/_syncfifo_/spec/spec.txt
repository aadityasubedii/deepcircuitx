Module name: syncfifo.
Module specification: The syncfifo module is a Verilog representation of a synchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer designed to operate with a clock signal (clk) and an active low reset signal (reset). It supports the operations of writing and reading 8-bit wide data elements through input signals, `write_en` and `read_en`, respectively. The module has input ports including `clk`, `reset`, `write_en`, `read_en`, and `data_in`, where `data_in` is the 8-bit data to be written into the FIFO. The output ports comprise `full`, `empty`, and an 8-bit `out` signal. The `full` signal indicates whether the FIFO is at its capacity of 8 elements, preventing further writes, while `empty` signals if the FIFO has no elements, preventing reads. The `out` signal outputs the data read from the FIFO. The module utilizes internal signals such as an 8-element memory vector (`memory_vec`) to store the data, `write_pointer` and `read_pointer` to index the next write and read positions within the FIFO, and a `count` signal to track the number of elements stored. The code is divided into three main always blocks: one that manages the `write_pointer` and writing into `memory_vec` conditional on `write_en` and the FIFO not being full; another that manages the `read_pointer` and assigns data to `out` based on `read_en` and the FIFO not being empty; and a third that adjusts the `count` based on the read and write enable signals, ensuring correct `full` and `empty` status indication and preventing FIFO underflows and overflows. This structured approach enables the syncfifo module to function as a robust, synchronous FIFO buffer for various data handling applications.
