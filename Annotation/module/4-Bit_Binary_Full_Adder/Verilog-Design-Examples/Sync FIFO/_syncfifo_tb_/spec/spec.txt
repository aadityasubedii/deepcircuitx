Module name: syncfifo_tb

Module specification: The `syncfifo_tb` module is a testbench for verifying the functionality of the `syncfifo` moduleâ€”a synchronous First-In, First-Out (FIFO) buffer. This testbench module does not have input and output ports as it acts as a standalone simulation environment. The primary purpose is to stimulate `syncfifo` and observe its behavior under various conditions. The testbench generates a clock signal (`clk`) to synchronize all operations within the FIFO. A reset signal (`reset`) is used to bring the FIFO to a known state before starting any operations. Write operations are controlled by the `write_en` signal, which, when asserted, enables the testbench to send 8-bit wide data (`data_in`) into the FIFO. Read operations are triggered by asserting the `read_en` signal, which enables data to be read from the FIFO. The testbench monitors two status signals, `full` and `empty`, which indicate whether the FIFO is full or empty, respectively. The `out` signal is an 8-bit wide output carrying the data read from the FIFO. Internally within the testbench, an initial block generates a continuous clock signal by toggling the `clk` signal every 5 time units. Another initial block performs the reset sequence, followed by write and read operations defined in their respective tasks (`write` and `read`). The `write` task activates `write_en` and assigns a random value to `data_in`. The `read` task activates `read_en` to allow data to be read from the FIFO. The testbench simulation runs for a fixed duration before calling `$finish` to terminate the simulation. This structured approach allows systematic testing of FIFO operations, such as data insertion, retrieval, and the handling of boundary conditions like full and empty states.
