Module-level comment: The `syncfifo_tb` is a testbench for a synchronous FIFO buffer, stimulating and observing FIFO operations. It generates a clock, sequences a reset, and simulates write/read cycles with enable signals (`write_en`, `read_en`) and data (`data_in`). Status signals (`full`, `empty`) are monitored, and the `write` and `read` tasks provide random data input and data retrieval, respectively. The testbench runs for a specified duration to validate FIFO behavior under various conditions.
