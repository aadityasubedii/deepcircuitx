Module-level comment: The `full_adder_1bit_tb` module serves as a testbench for a one-bit full adder, validating its functionality by simulating several input cases. It generates random inputs for the full adder (`a`, `b`, `cin`), calculates expected results (`new_sum`, `new_carry`), and verifies the outputs (`sum`, `carry`) against these calculations. The process is repeated 100 times, and the results of each test are displayed, confirming the accuracy of the full adder's operations.
