Module name: full_adder_1bit_tb. Module specification: The `full_adder_1bit_tb` is a Verilog testbench module designed to test and validate the functionality of a one-bit full adder circuit. The module simulates input conditions and compares the full adder's outputs with expected values. The input ports include `a`, `b`, and `cin`, which represent a one-bit operand, a second one-bit operand, and a carry-in bit, respectively. The output ports, `sum` and `carry`, provide the result of the addition and the carry-out bit. Internal signals `new_sum` and `new_carry` are employed to hold the expected results for the sum and carry, calculated manually within the testbench. The module consists of an instantiation of the full adder device under test (DUT), whose operations are simulated by the testbench through a task named `stimulus`. This task generates random values for inputs, applies these to the full adder, and manually calculates the expected results. The testbench repeats these steps 100 times, checking each outcome for correctness and supplying informative pass/fail messages for each test case based on the comparison of the full adder's outputs with the internally calculated expected outputs. Upon conclusion of the repetitions, the simulation is terminated using the `$finish` command.
