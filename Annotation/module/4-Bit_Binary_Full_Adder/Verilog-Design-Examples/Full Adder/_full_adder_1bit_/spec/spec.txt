Module name: full_adder_1bit. Module specification: The 'full_adder_1bit' Verilog module implements a digital circuit for a 1-bit full adder, which calculates the sum of three binary digits: two input bits, 'i_a' and 'i_b', along with a carry-in bit 'i_cin'. The module is characterized by two primary outputs: 'o_sum' and 'o_carry'. The output 'o_sum' represents the bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) sum of 'i_a', 'i_b', and 'i_cin', essentially providing the non-carry summed output of the three input bits. Conversely, 'o_carry' determines whether a carry is generated by the addition, using a combination of AND and OR operations across the input pairs to signify an overflow bit that serves as the carry-out. This output is crucial for sequential bit addition in multi-bit full adder structures. Internally, the module does not use any signals other than the inputs and outputs; the logical operations are directly mapped to the output assignments without intermediate stages. The code is structured simply with direct assignments for 'o_sum' and 'o_carry', making for an efficient and straightforward implementation of combinational logic.
