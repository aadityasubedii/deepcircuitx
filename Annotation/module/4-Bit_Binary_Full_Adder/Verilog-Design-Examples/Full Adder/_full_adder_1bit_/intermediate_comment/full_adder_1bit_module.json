    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'full_adder_1bit' module realizes a 1-bit full adder circuit for computing the sum of three input bits ('i_a', 'i_b', 'i_cin') and the carry-out bit ('o_carry'). The sum ('o_sum') is derived using a bitwise XOR of all inputs, while the carry-out is computed with a combination of AND and OR operations across input pairs. No internal signals are used; all operations are performed directly in the output assignments, enabling a compact combinational logic design."
