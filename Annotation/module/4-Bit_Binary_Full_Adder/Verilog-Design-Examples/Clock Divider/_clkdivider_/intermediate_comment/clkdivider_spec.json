    "spec": "Module name: clkdivider. \n\nModule specification: The clkdivider module is a hardware component designed to generate an output clock signal (`out_clk`) with a frequency that is half of the original input clock signal frequency (`clk`). The module takes two input ports: a clock input (`clk`) and a reset signal (`reset`). The `clk` input signal is the reference clock whose frequency is to be divided, while the `reset` signal is used to initialize or restart the clock division process by setting internal states to their initial values. The output of the module is the divided clock signal, `out_clk`, which toggles at half the frequency of the input clock. Internally, the module utilizes a 2-bit counter (`clk_count`) to keep track of the rising edges of the input clock signal. This counter increments on every positive edge of `clk` unless the `reset` signal is active, in which case both `clk_count` and `out_clk` are reset to 0. The alteration of the output clock signal is based on the most significant bit (MSB) of the `clk_count`, allowing `out_clk` to toggle at the desired frequency. The code is structured into a primary always block that reacts to the positive edge of the `clk` signal. Within this block, conditional statements check for the `reset` signal; if active, they reset the internal counter and output clock. If `reset` is not active, the counter is incremented and the output clock is set based on the MSB of `clk_count`, managing the clock division functionality effectively. Through this design, the clkdivider module serves as a fundamental clock management component in digital circuits by reducing the frequency of clock signals in a controlled manner.",

It takes an input clock (`clk`) and a reset signal (`reset`). The output `out_clk` is a clock signal with a frequency that is half of the input clock frequency. The module works by incrementing a 2-bit counter `clk_count` on every rising edge of the input clock. When `reset` is active, `clk_count` and `out_clk` are both reset to 0. The output clock, `out_clk`, mirrors the most significant bit of the counter, effectively reducing the frequency of the input clock by a factor of 2. The module ensures the clock division functionality is executed repeatedly by counting cycles with `clk_count` and toggling the output clock based on this count."
