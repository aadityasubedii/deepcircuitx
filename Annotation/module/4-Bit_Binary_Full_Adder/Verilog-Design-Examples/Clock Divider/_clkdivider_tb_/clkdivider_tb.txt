Module-level comment: The `clkdivider_tb` module acts as a testbench for the clock divider circuit, verifying proper operation by generating test clocks and reset pulses, then comparing the clock divider's output to an expected pattern. The stimuli generation and verification use tasks `stimulus` and `verify` with internal signals `new_clk` and `clk_count` to toggle the test clock, manage resets, and validate the output, with results displayed for each test case.
