Using stimulus and verify tasks, it repeatedly toggles the clock and reset signals to test the output of the clock divider under various conditions. The testbench compares a locally generated clock signal (`new_clk`) and the divider output (`out_clk`), reporting the results as pass or fail based on their match for each test case.
