Using stimulus and verify tasks, it repeatedly toggles the clock and reset signals to test the output of the clock divider under various conditions. The testbench compares a locally generated clock signal (`new_clk`) and the divider output (`out_clk`), reporting the results as pass or fail based on their match for each test case. The purpose is to ensure that the clock divider module operates as expected by verifying output against a predictable pattern."

The counter increments every time the `verify` task is called, until it matches a specified count (minus one, due to zero-indexing). When it matches, `new_clk` is toggled, and `clk_count` is reset to zero, thus facilitating the pattern for `new_clk` to verify against `out_clk`.
