Module name: clkdivider_tb. Module specification: The `clkdivider_tb` module serves as a testbench designed to validate the functionality of a clock divider module (`clkdivider`) by simulating clock and reset inputs and comparing the output clock against an expected pattern. The module utilizes input ports `clk` (clock input to be divided) and `reset` (asynchronous reset signal) to drive the `clkdivider` module under test. The output port `out_clk` captures the divided clock output from the `clkdivider` module for verification. Additionally, internal signals include `new_clk`, a locally generated clock used to verify the correctness of `out_clk`, and `clk_count`, a counter to control the toggling of `new_clk`. The module's code consists of initial blocks to set initial values, and tasks such as `stimulus` to toggle the `clk` and reset signals, and `verify` to check the alignment between `out_clk` and `new_clk` while incrementing the `clk_count` and displaying the test results. This structure supports comprehensive testing to ensure the clock divider operates as intended under varying conditions.
