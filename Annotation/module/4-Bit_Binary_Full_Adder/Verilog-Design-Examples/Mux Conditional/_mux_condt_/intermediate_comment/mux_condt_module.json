    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mux_condt' module is a 4-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog. It routes one of four 2-bit inputs (in0, in1, in2, in3) to a 2-bit output (out) based on a 2-bit selector (select). Implementation uses a concise conditional operator where the MSB of 'select' chooses between two pairs of inputs, and the LSB picks within the chosen pair."
