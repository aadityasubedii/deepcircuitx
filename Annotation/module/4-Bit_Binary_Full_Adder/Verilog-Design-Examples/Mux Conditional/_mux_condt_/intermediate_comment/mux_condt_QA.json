It receives four 2-bit input vectors (in0, in1, in2, in3) and a 2-bit selection vector (select). The output (out) is also a 2-bit vector. The value of the select input determines which of the four inputs is forwarded to the output. If the most significant bit (MSB) of select is 1, then the output is either in3 or in2, depending on the least significant bit (LSB) of select. Conversely, if the MSB of select is 0, the output is either in1 or in0, also contingent on the LSB of the select vector."

The select input is a 2-bit vector that determines which of the four data inputs is routed to the output.
