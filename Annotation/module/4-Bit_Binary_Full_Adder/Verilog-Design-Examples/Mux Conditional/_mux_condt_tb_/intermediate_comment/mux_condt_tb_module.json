    "module": "Module-level comment: The `mux_condt_tb` testbench validates a 4-to-1 multiplexer (`mux_case`) operation by generating 100 random `select` inputs and comparing the multiplexer's output with expected values determined within a `stimulus` task. It utilizes four 2-bit inputs (`in0`-`in3`), a 2-bit `select`, and internal signal `new_out` for comparisons, outputting pass/fail messages based on match outcomes."
