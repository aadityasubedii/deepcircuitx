The multiplexer selects one of the four 2-bit input signals (`in0`, `in1`, `in2`, `in3`) based on a 2-bit select signal (`select`). During the simulation, the testbench generates a series of random select values to exercise the multiplexer. For each select value, the expected output (`new_out`) is determined using a `case` statement, and then compared with the actual output `out` from the `mux_case` module. If the expected result (`new_out`) matches the actual result (`out`), a \"Testcase Passed\" message is displayed; otherwise, a \"Testcase Failed\" message is displayed. This process is repeated 100 times."

Each carries different signals that can be selected as the output based on the value of the `select` port. `select` is a 2-bit input port that determines which of the four inputs (`in0`, `in1`, `in2`, `in3`) is routed to the output. Depending on the value of `select` (ranging from 0 to 3), the corresponding input signal is passed to the output.\n\nOutput ports: `out`.\nExplanation: `out` is a 2-bit output port that carries the selected input signal to the outside of the multiplexer module (`mux_case`). Based on the value present at the `select` port, one of the inputs (`in0`, `in1`, `in2`, `in3`) is forwarded to this output port. This port shows the result of the multiplexer selection process."
