    "spec": "Module name: mux_condt_tb.\nModule specification: The `mux_condt_tb` module is a testbench designed for verifying the functionality of a 2-bit 4-to-1 multiplexer instantiated as `mux_case`. It has four 2-bit input ports, `in0`, `in1`, `in2`, and `in3`, each representing different signals that could be selected as output. The 2-bit `select` input port determines which of these inputs is routed to the 2-bit `out` output port by carrying a value ranging from 0 to 3. Internal to the module is a 2-bit register `new_out` used to store the expected output based on the `select` value for comparison purposes. In the initial block of the code, the input ports are set to predefined values and a `repeat` loop triggers the `stimulus` task 100 times, generating random select values, calculating expected output by a `case` statement within `stimulus`, and comparing the output of the `mux_case` with `new_out`. The results of these comparisons are then output as pass/fail messages. The `stimulus` task handles the randomization of the select signal and the manual prediction of the multiplexer's output, providing the necessary stimuli for the testbench verification process.",

The multiplexer selects one of the four 2-bit input signals (`in0`, `in1`, `in2`, `in3`) based on a 2-bit select signal (`select`). During the simulation, the testbench generates a series of random select values to exercise the multiplexer. For each select value, the expected output (`new_out`) is determined using a `case` statement, and then compared with the actual output `out` from the `mux_case` module. If the expected result (`new_out`) matches the actual result (`out`), a \"Testcase Passed\" message is displayed; otherwise, a \"Testcase Failed\" message is displayed. This process is repeated 100 times."

Each carries different signals that can be selected as the output based on the value of the `select` port. `select` is a 2-bit input port that determines which of the four inputs (`in0`, `in1`, `in2`, `in3`) is routed to the output.
