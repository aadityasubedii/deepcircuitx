Module name: mux_condt_tb.
Module specification: The `mux_condt_tb` module is a testbench designed for verifying the functionality of a 2-bit 4-to-1 multiplexer instantiated as `mux_case`. It has four 2-bit input ports, `in0`, `in1`, `in2`, and `in3`, each representing different signals that could be selected as output. The 2-bit `select` input port determines which of these inputs is routed to the 2-bit `out` output port by carrying a value ranging from 0 to 3. Internal to the module is a 2-bit register `new_out` used to store the expected output based on the `select` value for comparison purposes. In the initial block of the code, the input ports are set to predefined values and a `repeat` loop triggers the `stimulus` task 100 times, generating random select values, calculating expected output by a `case` statement within `stimulus`, and comparing the output of the `mux_case` with `new_out`. The results of these comparisons are then output as pass/fail messages. The `stimulus` task handles the randomization of the select signal and the manual prediction of the multiplexer's output, providing the necessary stimuli for the testbench verification process.
