Module name: moore_ol_tb.
Module specification: The module 'moore_ol_tb' is designed as a testbench for a Moore finite state machine (FSM), specifically targeting the test of an FSM named 'moore_ol'. It functions by generating random stimuli for the 'in' input and applying them to an instantiated DUT (Device Under Test) using the same name within each positive clock edge. This testbench utilizes three inputs, namely 'in', 'clk', and 'reset'. The 'in' signal serves as the primary input for state transitions in the DUT, while 'clk' is the clock signal that orchestrates synchronization throughout the testbench and the FSM operations. 'reset' is used to initialize the FSM's state to a defined starting state before simulation proper begins. The only output port, 'out', represents the output state of the FSM contingent on the input stimuli and transition logic. Internally, the testbench uses 'new_out' as an anticipated output of the DUT, 'ps' to hold the present state, and 'ns' to determine the FSM's next state based on the current state and input. The testbench's body comprises initial blocks for setting up the simulation's reset and clock, stimulus generation within a repeat loop for driving the 'in' signal, and task definitions for creating these stimuli. Furthermore, it contains an always block that governs state transitions and output expectations based on 'ps' and 'in', with a second always block to update the present state with the next state at each clock edge or upon reset. Overall, this testbench assesses if the FSM properly follows the transition and output logic by comparing 'out' with 'new_out', thereby validating the FSM's correctness under varied input conditions and specifically detecting the recognition of an input sequence "1101" when both 'out' and 'new_out' are high.
