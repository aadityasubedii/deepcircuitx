    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'moore_ol_tb' module serves as a testbench simulating the 'moore_ol' Moore FSM. It generates a clock, applies random input stimuli, and manages a reset sequence. Internal logic validates the FSM's state transitions and output responses, recording test pass/fail results based on comparison with expected behavior."
