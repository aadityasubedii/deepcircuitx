Module-level comment: The `moore_ol` module implements a Moore finite state machine with five states, transitioning based on binary input `in`. It uses `clk` for synchronization and `reset` for initialization to state S0. Internal signals `present_state` and `next_state` manage state transitions, and output `out` signals when in state S4. Two always blocks handle state update and transition logic, ensuring synchronous operation and state-dependent output behavior.
