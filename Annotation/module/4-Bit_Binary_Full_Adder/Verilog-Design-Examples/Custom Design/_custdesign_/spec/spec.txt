Module name: custdesign.
Module specification: The `custdesign` module utilizes sequential and combinational logic to manipulate an input signal, `x`, to produce an output signal, `y`, synchronized by a clock signal `clk`. The module takes three inputs: `x`, the data input used in logical computations; `clk`, the clock input that drives the timing and operation of the internal flip-flops; and `reset`, a synchronous reset that initializes internal states. The sole output `y` presents the processed input data as determined by the internal logic of the module. Internally, it uses a set of signals: `a` and `abar`, which are the outputs of the first internal Set-Reset Flip-Flop (SRFF), named `sr1`; `b` and `bbar`, outputs of the second SRFF, `sr2`; `r2`, which is an XOR result from `a` and `x` serving as a reset input to `sr2`; and `s2`, a negation of `r2` acting as a set input to `sr2`. The module is composed of two main blocks: the instantiation of two `srff` flip-flops with accompanying logic to process their set and reset signals and the combinational logic that XORs `r2` and `b` to derive the final output `y`. This precise arrangement of flip-flops and logic gates creates a dynamic system where the output depends on the sequence of inputs as well as the instantaneous values, all working under the coordination of a clock signal.
