    "module": "Module-level comment: The `custdesign` module processes an input signal `x` through sequential and combinational logic, yielding an output `y`. It employs two Set-Reset Flip-Flops (`srff`) and XOR operations. The first flip-flop (`sr1`) generates intermediate signals `a` and `abar`. An XOR of `a` and `x` results in `r2`, driving the second flip-flop (`sr2`) alongside its complement `s2`, producing signals `b` and `bbar`. The final output `y` is derived from XORing `r2` and `b`, all synchronized by a `clk` signal."
