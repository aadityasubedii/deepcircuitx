Module-level comment: The 'custdesign_tb' serves as a testbench for verifying 'custdesign' functionality. It utilizes input signals 'x', 'clk', 'reset', and observes output 'y'. Internally, it toggles 'clk' every 5 units, initializes 'reset' and 'b', and runs a 200-unit simulation, ending after releasing 'reset' at 20 units. This setup tests 'custdesign' under defined conditions to ensure intended operation.
