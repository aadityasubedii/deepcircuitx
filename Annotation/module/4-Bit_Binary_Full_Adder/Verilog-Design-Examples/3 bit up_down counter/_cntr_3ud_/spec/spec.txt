Module name: cntr_3ud. Module specification: The `cntr_3ud` module is designed as a 3-bit up/down counter that operates synchronously with the system clock. It has three input ports: `up_down`, `clk`, and `reset`. The `up_down` port controls the counting direction, where a high signal decrements the counter and a low signal increments it. The `clk` port serves as the clock input, ensuring that the counter's value changes only at the rising edge of this signal for synchronized operation. The `reset` input initializes the counter value to 0 asynchronously, regardless of the clock signal, ensuring a safe initial state. There is a single output port, `bin_count`, which is a 3-bit signal representing the current count value. This value can either increase or decrease based on the `up_down` signal and is reset to 0 when the `reset` is active. Internally, `bin_count` is also used as a signal with `reg` declaration, acting as a register to store the count value, which is updated within a procedural block. The module includes an `always` block, triggered at the positive edge of the `clk` signal. Inside this block, the counter's response to the `reset` signal is prioritized; when high, `bin_count` is set to 0. If `reset` is not active, `bin_count` is either incremented or decremented based on the `up_down` signal status. This logical structure ensures the counter operates correctly in synchronous digital systems, providing flexibility in counting up or down as per the input signal.
