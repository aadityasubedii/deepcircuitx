    "module": "Module-level comment: The `cntr_3ud` module implements a 3-bit up/down counter, synchronous with the `clk`. Inputs include `up_down` for counting direction, `clk` for timing, and asynchronous `reset` for initialization to 0. The output, `bin_count`, reflects the current count, adjusting on `clk`'s rising edge based on `up_down` direction. An `always` block handles the counting logic, prioritizing the `reset` functionality."
