    "spec": "Module name: cntr_3ud. Module specification: The `cntr_3ud` module is designed as a 3-bit up/down counter that operates synchronously with the system clock. It has three input ports: `up_down`, `clk`, and `reset`. The `up_down` port controls the counting direction, where a high signal decrements the counter and a low signal increments it. The `clk` port serves as the clock input, ensuring that the counter's value changes only at the rising edge of this signal for synchronized operation. The `reset` input initializes the counter value to 0 asynchronously, regardless of the clock signal, ensuring a safe initial state. There is a single output port, `bin_count`, which is a 3-bit signal representing the current count value. This value can either increase or decrease based on the `up_down` signal and is reset to 0 when the `reset` is active. Internally, `bin_count` is also used as a signal with `reg` declaration, acting as a register to store the count value, which is updated within a procedural block. The module includes an `always` block, triggered at the positive edge of the `clk` signal. Inside this block, the counter's response to the `reset` signal is prioritized; when high, `bin_count` is set to 0. If `reset` is not active, `bin_count` is either incremented or decremented based on the `up_down` signal status. This logical structure ensures the counter operates correctly in synchronous digital systems, providing flexibility in counting up or down as per the input signal.",

It uses the input signals `up_down`, `clk`, and `reset` to control its operation. When the `reset` input is high, the counter value is set to 0. If `reset` is not active, the counter either increments or decrements its 3-bit binary count (`bin_count`) based on the `up_down` signal. Specifically, if `up_down` is high, it decrements the count; otherwise, it increments the count. This operation is synchronized to the rising edge of the `clk` signal, making it suitable for synchronous digital systems."
