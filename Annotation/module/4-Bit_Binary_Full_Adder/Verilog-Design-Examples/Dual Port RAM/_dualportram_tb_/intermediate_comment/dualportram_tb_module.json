    "module": "Module-level comment: The `dualportram_tb` module is a testbench for verifying a dual-port RAM. It initializes test conditions, generates stimuli (random addresses and data), and toggles write enables to perform and validate memory operations. Clock synchronization and internal storage (`ram_vector`) mimic the RAM's behavior, while output comparisons determine test success."
