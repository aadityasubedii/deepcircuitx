    "module": "Module-level comment: The dualport_ram is a synchronous dual-port memory module that supports concurrent read and write operations. It operates on a positive-edge clock (clk), handling independent write/read actions for each port (A and B) through designated write enable signals (wr_en_a, wr_en_b). Writing is performed if the enable is high; otherwise, it reads from the specified addresses (addr_a, addr_b) into respective outputs (data_out_a, data_out_b). The module uses an internal vector `ram_vector` to store and manage data based on the operation requested by each port."
