Module name: dualport_ram.

Module specification: The dualport_ram is a Verilog module that serves as a dual-port RAM with synchronous read and write capabilities, using a shared memory of 8 elements, each 128 bits wide. The module operates on a positive edge clock (`clk`) and features two sets of inputs: `wr_en_a` and `wr_en_b` as write enable flags for port A and B, `addr_a` and `addr_b` for specifying the target memory addresses, and `data_in_a` and `data_in_b` as the input data for the respective ports. The output `data_out_a` and `data_out_b` present the read data from the memory array. Internally, the module uses `ram_vector` to store the write and read data, with `read_addr_a` and `read_addr_b` as intended registers for the read addresses, although these are not employed in the current logic. The module comprises two always blocks, each sensitive to the rising edge of the clock, handling the write or read operations for their respective ports. If the write enable flag for a port is high, the corresponding always block writes the input data to the designated address in `ram_vector`; if low, the block reads data from `ram_vector` at the address and assigns it to the corresponding `data_out` register.
