The purpose of the testbench is to simulate and verify that the `no_1s` module correctly calculates the number of '1's present in a 16-bit input vector named `a`. The testbench generates a 16-bit random value for `a`, and for each bit that is set to '1', a counter `new_no` is incremented. After applying this stimulus to the `dut`, the testbench checks if the output `no_ones` from the `dut` matches the calculated `new_no`. The result of the test case (passed or failed) is displayed based on the match between `new_no` and `no_ones`. A clock signal `clk` and a reset signal `reset` are also part of the testbench to provide timing and control during the simulation."

The `no_1s` module's ports are instantiated within the testbench and specified in the code snippet provided.\n\nInput ports: `i_a`, `clk`, `reset`.\nExplanation: \n- `i_a` (16-bit): This is the 16-bit input vector to which random values are assigned during the simulation. The `no_1s` module uses this input to calculate the number of '1's present in it.\n- `clk` (1-bit): This is the clock signal used to drive the sequential logic within the `no_1s` module, if any. A clock signal is essential for operations that are time-dependent and is toggled in the testbench to mimic real-world conditions.\n- `reset` (1-bit): This is the reset signal that is used to initialize or reset the state of the `no_1s` module to a known value. It is activated at the beginning of the simulation and then deactivated after a specified delay.\n\nOutput ports: `no_ones`.\nExplanation: \n- `no_ones` (4-bit): This is the output vector from the `no_1s` module. It is supposed to hold the count of '1's present in the input vector `i_a` after the `no_1s` module processes it. The testbench compares this output with the internally calculated `new_no` to verify the correctness of the `no_1s` module's functionality."
