    "module": "Module-level comment: The singleport_ram module implements an 8-word by 128-bit single-port RAM, storing data at an 'addr' location on a rising clock edge if 'wr_en' is high. It maintains the last accessed address in 'read_addr' and provides the data at this address via 'data_out', which updates asynchronously with respect to 'read_addr'."
