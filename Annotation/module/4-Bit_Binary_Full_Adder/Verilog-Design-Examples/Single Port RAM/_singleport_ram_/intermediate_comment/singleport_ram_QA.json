The module accepts a data input (`data_in`), a write enable signal (`wr_en`), an address input (`addr`), and a clock signal (`clk`). When `wr_en` is high, the data at the current address is written into the memory (`ram_vector`) on the rising edge of the clock. The module holds the last address accessed in a register called `read_addr`. The output (`data_out`) always reflects the data stored at the `read_addr` address in the memory, effectively making the read operation asynchronous to the clock."

It synchronizes the write operations to the memory.\n- `wr_en` (Write Enable): A signal that enables the write operation. When `wr_en` is high (1), the module writes data into the memory at the specified address; otherwise, no write operation occurs.\n- `addr` (Address): This input specifies the address in the memory where data is either to be written or from which the last data read is performed. It is a 3-bit wide signal, allowing access to 8 (2^3) different memory locations.\n- `data_in` (Data Input): The actual data to be written into the memory. It is 128 bits wide.\n\nOutput ports: `data_out`.\nExplanation:\n- `data_out` (Data Output): This port outputs the data stored in the memory at the address specified by `read_addr`, which retains the value of the last address accessed. The output is also 128 bits wide, consistent with the width of each memory word in the RAM. Note that the read operation effectively appears asynchronous since `data_out` updates instantaneously with changes to `read_addr` (although technically, it is synchronous with the clock due to how `read_addr` is updated on a clock edge)."

When a write is enabled and occurs, the `data_in` is stored into the memory location specified by the `addr`.\n\n- `read_addr`: This is a register used to hold the last address that was accessed for a read or write operation. On every rising edge of the clock, `read_addr` gets updated with the value of `addr`, regardless of whether a write operation took place. The reason for this register is to have the address stable for reading `data_out`.
