    "spec": "Module name: singleport_ram. \n\nModule specification: The singleport_ram module is designed as a single-port RAM with an 8-word storage capacity, where each word is 128 bits wide, catering to applications requiring temporary data storage with quick data access. This module incorporates several input ports: `clk` (clock), which synchronizes data write operations to the memory; `wr_en` (write enable), a control signal that, when high, allows data to be written into the memory; `addr` (address), a 3-bit wide signal determining the specific memory location for data storage or retrieval; and `data_in` (data input), which is the 128-bit wide data to be written into the memory. There is one output port, `data_out`, which outputs the data stored at the address specified by `read_addr`, where `read_addr` retains the value of the last accessed address. Internally, the module utilizes `ram_vector`, an 8-element array with each element being 128 bits wide, to represent the memory storage space, and `read_addr`, a register that holds the last accessed memory address. \n\nThe module\u2019s operation is divided into two primary blocks: the memory write block and the memory read block. In the memory write block, encapsulated within an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock, the module checks if `wr_en` is high; if so, `data_in` is written into the `ram_vector` at the location specified by `addr`. Simultaneously, `read_addr` is updated with the value of `addr`, ensuring the last accessed address is stored. The memory read block consists of a continuous assignment statement that updates `data_out` with the value stored in `ram_vector[read_addr]`, making the read operation appear asynchronous as `data_out` changes instantaneously with `read_addr`. This structured approach ensures a clear and efficient read-write functionality to the single-port RAM, optimizing it for systems requiring robust data handling capabilities.",

The module accepts a data input (`data_in`), a write enable signal (`wr_en`), an address input (`addr`), and a clock signal (`clk`). When `wr_en` is high, the data at the current address is written into the memory (`ram_vector`) on the rising edge of the clock. The module holds the last address accessed in a register called `read_addr`. The output (`data_out`) always reflects the data stored at the `read_addr` address in the memory, effectively making the read operation asynchronous to the clock."

It synchronizes the write operations to the memory.\n- `wr_en` (Write Enable): A signal that enables the write operation. When `wr_en` is high (1), the module writes data into the memory at the specified address; otherwise, no write operation occurs.\n- `addr` (Address): This input specifies the address in the memory where data is either to be written or from which the last data read is performed. It is a 3-bit wide signal, allowing access to 8 (2^3) different memory locations.\n- `data_in` (Data Input): The actual data to be written into the memory. It is 128 bits wide.\n\nOutput ports: `data_out`.\nExplanation:\n- `data_out` (Data Output): This port outputs the data stored in the memory at the address specified by `read_addr`, which retains the value of the last address accessed. The output is also 128 bits wide, consistent with the width of each memory word in the RAM. Note that the read operation effectively appears asynchronous since `data_out` updates instantaneously with changes to `read_addr` (although technically, it is synchronous with the clock due to how `read_addr` is updated on a clock edge)."

It comprises 8 elements, each 128 bits wide. This registers array represents the 8 memory locations of the single-port RAM. When a write is enabled and occurs, the `data_in` is stored into the memory location specified by the `addr`.\n\n- `read_addr`: This is a register used to hold the last address that was accessed for a read or write operation. On every rising edge of the clock, `read_addr` gets updated with the value of `addr`, regardless of whether a write operation took place. The reason for this register is to have the address stable for reading `data_out`. Since `data_out` is always driven by `ram_vector[read_addr]`, updating `read_addr` on a clock edge ensures that the data read from the RAM does not change until the next clock cycle, providing a stable output."
