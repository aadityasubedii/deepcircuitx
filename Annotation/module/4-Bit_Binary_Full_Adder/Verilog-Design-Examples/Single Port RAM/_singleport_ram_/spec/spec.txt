Module name: singleport_ram. 

Module specification: The singleport_ram module is designed as a single-port RAM with an 8-word storage capacity, where each word is 128 bits wide, catering to applications requiring temporary data storage with quick data access. This module incorporates several input ports: `clk` (clock), which synchronizes data write operations to the memory; `wr_en` (write enable), a control signal that, when high, allows data to be written into the memory; `addr` (address), a 3-bit wide signal determining the specific memory location for data storage or retrieval; and `data_in` (data input), which is the 128-bit wide data to be written into the memory. There is one output port, `data_out`, which outputs the data stored at the address specified by `read_addr`, where `read_addr` retains the value of the last accessed address. Internally, the module utilizes `ram_vector`, an 8-element array with each element being 128 bits wide, to represent the memory storage space, and `read_addr`, a register that holds the last accessed memory address. 

The moduleâ€™s operation is divided into two primary blocks: the memory write block and the memory read block. In the memory write block, encapsulated within an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the clock, the module checks if `wr_en` is high; if so, `data_in` is written into the `ram_vector` at the location specified by `addr`. Simultaneously, `read_addr` is updated with the value of `addr`, ensuring the last accessed address is stored. The memory read block consists of a continuous assignment statement that updates `data_out` with the value stored in `ram_vector[read_addr]`, making the read operation appear asynchronous as `data_out` changes instantaneously with `read_addr`. This structured approach ensures a clear and efficient read-write functionality to the single-port RAM, optimizing it for systems requiring robust data handling capabilities.
