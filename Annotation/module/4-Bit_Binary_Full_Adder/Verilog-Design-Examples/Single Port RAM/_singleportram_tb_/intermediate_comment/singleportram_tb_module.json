    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'singleportram_tb' module serves as a testbench to validate a single-port RAM's read/write operations. It generates a clock, exercises the RAM with pseudorandom data/addresses, and compares output against an (unimplemented) expected result. The bench toggles the write enable signal to switch between read and write modes, and is designed for simulation termination after a fixed duration."
