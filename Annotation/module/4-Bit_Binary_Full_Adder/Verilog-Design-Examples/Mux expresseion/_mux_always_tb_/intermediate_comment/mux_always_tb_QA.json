It tests how the multiplexer behaves when randomly generated input values and select signals are provided. The module generates inputs `in0`, `in1`, and the select signal using random values and then checks the output against the expected result `new_out` which is determined by the select signal. The multiplexer operates by choosing `in1` if the select signal is high (`1`), and `in0` if it is low (`0`). The testbench repeatedly checks 100 cases and displays whether each case passes or fails based on whether the output matches the expected result."

Its value is determined by the select signal such that if `select` is high (`1`), `out` will equal `in1` and if `select` is low (`0`), `out` will equal `in0`.

Unlike conventional input or output signals, `new_out` isn't connected to the `mux_always` instance. Instead, it is manually calculated in the `stimulus` task based on the current values of `in0`, `in1`, and the `select` signal. The calculation follows the same logic as the multiplexer itself: if `select` is high (`1`), `new_out` is assigned the value of `in1`; if `select` is low (`0`), `new_out` takes the value of `in0`. This signal is crucial for the verification process, as it enables the module to compare the actual output of the multiplexer (`out`) against what is expected (`new_out`). By doing so, it can determine if the multiplexer instance (`mux_always`) is functioning correctly under various input conditions."
