It initiates testing by generating random values for the input ports `in0`, `in1`, and the control signal `select`. The multiplexer's behavior is simulated by dynamically deciding the output (`out`) based on the value of `select`: if `select` is high (`1`), `out` mirrors `in1`; if low (`0`), `out` aligns with `in0`. The internal signal `new_out` is leveraged as an expected outcome indicator, calculated independently within a task named `stimulus` to validate whether the multiplexer operates accurately under the input conditions by comparing `new_out` with `out`. The testbench iterates this verification 100 times, with each iteration consisting of random signal generation, expected output calculation, and result comparison, subsequently reporting whether each test case passes or fails based on the consistency of `out` and `new_out`. This comprehensive approach ensures meticulous validation of the multiplexer\u2019s execution across varied scenarios.",

It tests how the multiplexer behaves when randomly generated input values and select signals are provided. The module generates inputs `in0`, `in1`, and the select signal using random values and then checks the output against the expected result `new_out` which is determined by the select signal. The multiplexer operates by choosing `in1` if the select signal is high (`1`), and `in0` if it is low (`0`).

Instead, it is manually calculated in the `stimulus` task based on the current values of `in0`, `in1`, and the `select` signal. The calculation follows the same logic as the multiplexer itself: if `select` is high (`1`), `new_out` is assigned the value of `in1`; if `select` is low (`0`), `new_out` takes the value of `in0`. This signal is crucial for the verification process, as it enables the module to compare the actual output of the multiplexer (`out`) against what is expected (`new_out`).
