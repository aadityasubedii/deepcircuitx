Module name: mux_always_tb. 
Module specification: The `mux_always_tb` module serves as a testbench for evaluating the functionality of a multiplexer through the `mux_always` instance. It initiates testing by generating random values for the input ports `in0`, `in1`, and the control signal `select`. The multiplexer's behavior is simulated by dynamically deciding the output (`out`) based on the value of `select`: if `select` is high (`1`), `out` mirrors `in1`; if low (`0`), `out` aligns with `in0`. The internal signal `new_out` is leveraged as an expected outcome indicator, calculated independently within a task named `stimulus` to validate whether the multiplexer operates accurately under the input conditions by comparing `new_out` with `out`. The testbench iterates this verification 100 times, with each iteration consisting of random signal generation, expected output calculation, and result comparison, subsequently reporting whether each test case passes or fails based on the consistency of `out` and `new_out`. This comprehensive approach ensures meticulous validation of the multiplexerâ€™s execution across varied scenarios.
