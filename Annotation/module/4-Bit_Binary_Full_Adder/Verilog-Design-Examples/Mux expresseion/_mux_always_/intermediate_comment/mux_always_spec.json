    "spec": "Module name: mux_always. Module specification: The 'mux_always' module in Verilog is a simple implementation of a 2-to-1 multiplexer that outputs one of two input signals based on a select signal. It processes two input signals 'in0' and 'in1', and one input select signal 'select'. The output signal 'out' is determined by the state of the 'select' input: when 'select' is low (0), the output is 'in0'; when 'select' is high (1), the output is 'in1'. The module directly assigns the output based on the logical operations performed on the inputs wherein 'in0' is ANDed with the inverse of 'select', and 'in1' is ANDed with 'select'. These results are then ORed to produce the output 'out'. There are no internal signals utilized as the module computes the output using a single continuous assignment statement. This module's Verilog code is concise and consists solely of the module declaration, port declaration, and the assignment statement for the output, efficiently encapsulating the multiplexer functionality.",
