The multiplexer functionality is implemented using a single assignment statement. When 'select' is low (0), 'in0' is passed to the output; when 'select' is high (1), 'in1' is passed to the output. This behavior is achieved through a logical operation where 'in0' is ANDed with the inverse of 'select', and 'in1' is ANDed with 'select'; the results of these two operations are then ORed together to produce the final output."
