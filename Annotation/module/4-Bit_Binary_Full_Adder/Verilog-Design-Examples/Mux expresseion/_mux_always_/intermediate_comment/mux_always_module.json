    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mux_always' module implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer, selecting between 'in0' and 'in1' based on the 'select' signal. The output 'out' reflects 'in0' when 'select' is 0, and 'in1' when 'select' is 1, using a logical combination of AND and OR operations in a single assignment statement without internal signals."
