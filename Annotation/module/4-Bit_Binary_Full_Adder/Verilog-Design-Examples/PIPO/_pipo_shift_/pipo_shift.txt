Module-level comment: The 'pipo_shift' module implements a 16-bit PIPO shifter with selectable shift operations. On a positive clock edge, it conditionally loads data and applies either a logical left, logical right, arithmetic left, or arithmetic right shift based on a 2-bit control signal. Reset clears the output, while the load signal captures input data into an internal register for shifting.
