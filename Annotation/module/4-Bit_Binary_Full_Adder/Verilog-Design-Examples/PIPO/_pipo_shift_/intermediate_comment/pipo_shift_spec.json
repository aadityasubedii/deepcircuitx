    "spec": "Module name: pipo_shift. Module specification: The pipo_shift module is designed to perform parallel in parallel out (PIPO) shifting operations on a 16-bit input signal. The module accepts a 16-bit input signal (`data_in`), a load control signal (`load`), a 2-bit shift type selector (`shift_en`), a clock signal (`clk`), and a reset signal (`reset`). The output of the module is a 16-bit signal (`data_out`). Internally, `temp_data` is a 16-bit register that temporarily holds data from `data_in` when `load` is high. The module operates synchronously to the positive edge of `clk`. Upon a reset (`reset` being high), `data_out` is cleared to 0. If not reset, and if `load` is asserted, `temp_data` captures the value from `data_in`. Based on the value of `shift_en`, the data can undergo one of four shift operations: logical shift left (0), logical shift right (1), arithmetic shift left (2), and arithmetic shift right while preserving the sign bit (3). The result of the chosen shift operation is stored in `data_out`. This module facilitates various data manipulation schemes necessary for efficient data transmission or processing in digital systems.",

The module takes in a 16-bit data input (data_in), a load signal, a shift enable signal (shift_en) with 2 bits to determine the type of shift operation, a clock signal (clk), and a reset signal. When the reset is active, the output (data_out) is cleared to 0. If the load signal is asserted (high) and reset is not active, the input data is loaded into an internal register (temp_data). Depending on the value of shift_en, the module can perform one of four operations on the next rising edge of the clock:\n\n0. Logical shift left by 1 bit.\n1. Logical shift right by 1 bit.\n2. Arithmetic shift left by 1 bit (same as logical shift left, since Verilog does not distinguish between them).\n3. Arithmetic shift right by 1 bit (preserving the sign bit).\n\nThe result of the selected shift operation is assigned to data_out."

It selects between four different shift operations.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation:\n- `data_out`: 16-bit output which holds the results of the shifting operations performed on the data_in.
