The module takes in a 16-bit data input (data_in), a load signal, a shift enable signal (shift_en) with 2 bits to determine the type of shift operation, a clock signal (clk), and a reset signal. When the reset is active, the output (data_out) is cleared to 0. If the load signal is asserted (high) and reset is not active, the input data is loaded into an internal register (temp_data). Depending on the value of shift_en, the module can perform one of four operations on the next rising edge of the clock:\n\n0. Logical shift left by 1 bit.\n1. Logical shift right by 1 bit.\n2. Arithmetic shift left by 1 bit (same as logical shift left, since Verilog does not distinguish between them).\n3. Arithmetic shift right by 1 bit (preserving the sign bit).\n\nThe result of the selected shift operation is assigned to data_out."

It selects between four different shift operations.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation:\n- `data_out`: 16-bit output which holds the results of the shifting operations performed on the data_in.
