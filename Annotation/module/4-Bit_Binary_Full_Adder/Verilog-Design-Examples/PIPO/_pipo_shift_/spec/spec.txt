Module name: pipo_shift. Module specification: The pipo_shift module is designed to perform parallel in parallel out (PIPO) shifting operations on a 16-bit input signal. The module accepts a 16-bit input signal (`data_in`), a load control signal (`load`), a 2-bit shift type selector (`shift_en`), a clock signal (`clk`), and a reset signal (`reset`). The output of the module is a 16-bit signal (`data_out`). Internally, `temp_data` is a 16-bit register that temporarily holds data from `data_in` when `load` is high. The module operates synchronously to the positive edge of `clk`. Upon a reset (`reset` being high), `data_out` is cleared to 0. If not reset, and if `load` is asserted, `temp_data` captures the value from `data_in`. Based on the value of `shift_en`, the data can undergo one of four shift operations: logical shift left (0), logical shift right (1), arithmetic shift left (2), and arithmetic shift right while preserving the sign bit (3). The result of the chosen shift operation is stored in `data_out`. This module facilitates various data manipulation schemes necessary for efficient data transmission or processing in digital systems.
