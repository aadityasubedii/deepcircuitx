Module name: pipo_shift_tb.
Module specification: The "pipo_shift_tb" serves as a testbench for verifying the "pipo_shift" module, which operates on 16-bit data inputs. This module is assumed to conduct Parallel-In Parallel-Out (PIPO) operations as well as shifting functions triggered by control signals. The input ports include a 16-bit `data_in`, which is the primary data input; `load`, a signal that likely instructs the module when to capture this data; a 2-bit `shift_en` that selects the shift operation mode; `clk` to provide timing for synchronous operations; and `reset`, an asynchronous input to initialize the module to a known state. The single output port `data_out` is also 16 bits wide, representing the result of the module's operations. Internal signals within the testbench mirror these inputs and outputs, specifically `data_in`, `load`, `shift_en`, `clk`, `reset` as register signals, and `data_out` as a wire. The primary blocks of the testbench are initial blocks that simulate the reset process, clock signal, input stimulus, and end the simulation after a predefined time. The DUT (Device Under Test) instantiation within the testbench connects these signals to the "pipo_shift" module for functional validation.
