Module name: bin_gry. Module specification: The `bin_gry` module is a parameterized Verilog design that converts an N-bit binary number to its equivalent N-bit Gray code representation, where N is a configurable parameter with a default value of 8 bits. This module has a single N-bit wide input port named `binary`, which accepts the binary number to be converted. It features a corresponding N-bit wide output port named `gray`, which presents the resulting Gray code. Since the module directly transforms the input to output without the need for intermediate storage, there are no explicitly declared internal signals within the module. The transformation is performed within an `always` block that triggers on changes to the `binary` input. Inside this block, the most significant bit (MSB) of the output `gray` is assigned the same value as the MSB of the `binary` input, while the rest of the Gray code bits are generated by a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation between the `binary` input shifted right by one bit and the original `binary` input itself. This straightforward and efficient hardware representation provides a clear example of combinational logic where the output is solely dependent on the current input without any internal state.
