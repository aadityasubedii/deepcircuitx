    "module": "Module-level comment: The `bin_gry` module performs N-bit binary to Gray code conversion, where N is a parameterizable bit-width. It utilizes a bitwise XOR operation within an `always` block to generate the Gray code output, directly from the input binary number, by XORing each binary bit with the bit to its immediate left, maintaining the binary MSB as the MSB in Gray code."
