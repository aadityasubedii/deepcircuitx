It takes an N-bit binary input and outputs an N-bit Gray code. The most significant bit (MSB) of the Gray code is the same as the MSB of the binary input. The rest of the bits of the Gray code are generated by performing a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation between the binary input number shifted by one bit and the original binary input number."
