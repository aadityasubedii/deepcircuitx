It generates random binary numbers, converts them into Gray code both through a unit-under-test (DUT) and a manual method defined in the 'stimulus' task. It then compares the Gray code outputs from the DUT and the manual calculation to check for consistency and correctness, displaying the test result as either 'Pass' or 'Fail'."

This input is provided through a pseudo-random value generation within the 'stimulus' task.\n\nOutput ports: [gray].\nExplanation: The 'gray' output port holds the Gray-coded equivalent of the binary input.
