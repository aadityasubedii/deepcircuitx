    "spec": "Module name: bin_gry_tb.\nModule specification: The bin_gry_tb module is a testbench designed to validate a binary to Gray code converter. It is parameterized with 'N' set to a default of 8, representing the number of bits for the input and output signals. A register named 'binary' serves as the input port to the converter, and it is loaded with pseudo-random binary numbers generated within the 'stimulus' task. The corresponding Gray code output is represented by the 'gray' wire. An internal register 'new_gray' is used for comparing the Gray code output from the design-under-test (DUT) with the manually calculated Gray code within the 'stimulus' task. \n\nThe testbench includes an instance of the binary to Gray code converter module ('bin_gry'), connecting the 'binary' and 'gray' signals to the DUT's input and output ports, respectively. In the initial block, the 'stimulus' task is invoked repeatedly to test multiple binary inputs, and a comparison is made between the DUT-generated Gray code and the manually calculated 'new_gray' code. Based on this comparison, the test results are displayed as 'Pass' or 'Fail' for each case, indicating the success or failure of the conversion process implemented by the DUT.\n\nThe 'stimulus' task initializes the 'binary' register with a random value, manually calculates the expected Gray code storing it in 'new_gray', and checks the outcome after a 5-time unit delay. This checking and display of results is performed in the main initial block, which serves as the testbench's execution starting point. The testbench\u2019s simplicity and structured testing approach make it efficient for verifying the functional correctness of binary to Gray code conversion designs.",
