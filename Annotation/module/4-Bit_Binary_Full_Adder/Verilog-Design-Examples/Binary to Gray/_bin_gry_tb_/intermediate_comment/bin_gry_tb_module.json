    "module": "Module-level comment: The bin_gry_tb module is a testbench for verifying binary to Gray code conversion. It uses a parameterized (N=8) input to simulate random binary values, converts them to Gray code through both a design-under-test (DUT) and manual calculation in the 'stimulus' task, and compares the results. Successful conversion is indicated by a 'Pass' in test outputs, achieved through iterative testing and result comparison in an initial block and a procedural task for generating and verifying Gray codes."
