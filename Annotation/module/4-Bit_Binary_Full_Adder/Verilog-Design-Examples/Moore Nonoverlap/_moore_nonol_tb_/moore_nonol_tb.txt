Module-level comment: The `moore_nonol_tb` module tests a Moore FSM (`dut`) for detecting a "1101" sequence via input `in`. It employs `in`, `clk`, and `reset` for FSM stimulation and state initialization. Internally, it utilizes `new_out`, `ps`, and `ns` for output comparison and state management. The testbench executes dynamic input stimuli, compares expected and actual outputs, and manages state transitions and output logic through procedural and always blocks.
