    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'moore_nonol' module implements a Moore FSM for processing binary inputs and generating a binary output. Utilizing inputs 'in', 'clk', and 'reset', it transitions through five states (S0-S4) on clock edges, outputting high only in state S4. Internally, 'present_state' and 'next_state' manage the FSM's current and future states, while output logic is determined within a case statement in an always block triggered by 'clk' and 'reset', directing state transitions and output based on inputs and current state."
