Module-level comment: The 'dff_sync' module is a D-type flip-flop with synchronous reset, sampling data input 'i_d' on the rising edge of 'clk' and resetting output 'o_q' to 0 when 'reset' is active. Output 'o_qb' is the inverse of 'o_q'. Uses an 'always' block for clock-triggered logic and 'assign' statement for inversion.
