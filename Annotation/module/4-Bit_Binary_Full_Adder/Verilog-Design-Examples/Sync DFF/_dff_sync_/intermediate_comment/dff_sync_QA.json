When the clock signal (clk) goes high (positive edge), if the reset signal is active, the output (o_q) is set to 0. If the reset is not active, the output (o_q) is set to the value of the input signal (i_d). There is also an inverted output (o_qb) which is complement of o_q. This kind of flip-flop is typically used in digital circuits to store data on the rising edge of the clock signal with the capability of being asynchronously reset to a known state."
