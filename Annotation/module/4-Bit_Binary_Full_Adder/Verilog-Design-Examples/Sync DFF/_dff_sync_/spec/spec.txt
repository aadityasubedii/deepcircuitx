Module name: dff_sync. Module specification: The dff_sync module implements a D-type flip-flop with synchronous reset functionality in Verilog, designed to store data bits in digital circuits. It features input ports: i_d (data input), clk (clock input), and reset (synchronous reset input), along with output ports: o_q (main output) and o_qb (inverted output). The i_d port is sampled at the rising edge of clk; if reset is inactive, o_q is updated to the value of i_d, otherwise reset to 0. The clk input orchestrates the timing for data sampling and output updates, and the reset input synchronously resets o_q to 0 on the clock’s positive edge. The o_q output represents the stored value, or 0 if reset is active, while o_qb provides the complement of o_q, ensuring that o_qb is always the inverse of the main output.

Internally, the module uses a register (o_q) to hold the output value, which is directly affected by the i_d and reset signals upon the positive edge of the clk. The operational logic of the module is encapsulated within an "always" block that triggers on the positive edge of clk to evaluate the reset condition: setting o_q to 0 if reset is active, or capturing the i_d value otherwise. An "assign" statement outside the "always" block defines o_qb as the logical negation of o_q, ensuring that o_qb is updated to reflect the inverse of the current data stored in o_q. This structure highlights the module's critical functions—data storage with synchronous reset capability and inverted output generation—suitable for various digital storage and logic circuit applications.
