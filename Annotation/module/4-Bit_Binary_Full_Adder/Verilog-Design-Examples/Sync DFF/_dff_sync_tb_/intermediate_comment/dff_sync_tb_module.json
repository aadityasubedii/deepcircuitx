    "module": "Module-level comment: The dff_sync_tb module serves as a testbench for verifying a synchronous D flip-flop (dff_sync). It automatically generates a clock signal, provides random data and reset conditions using a stimulus task, and checks the flip-flop's output for correctness every 5 time units across 100 test cycles. The simulation concludes with a pass/fail report for flip-flop's data capturing and reset behavior."
