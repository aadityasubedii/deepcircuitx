    "spec": "Module name: dff_sync_tb. Module specification: The dff_sync_tb is a Verilog testbench designed to verify the functionality of a synchronous D flip-flop. It instantiates a D flip-flop module (dff_sync) and tests its behavior over 100 cycles using random data and reset inputs. The module has three input ports: 'd' (data input to the flip-flop toggled randomly in the testbench), 'clk' (the clock signal that controls data sampling, toggled every unit time in the testbench), and 'reset' (asynchronously resets the flip-flop, also toggled randomly). The outputs are 'q' (the primary output reflecting the stored data value after the clock edge, unless reset) and 'qb' (the complement of 'q'). Internally, these input and output signals are utilized in several testbench blocks: a clock generator (`initial begin` block continuously toggling 'clk'), a stimulus task (randomly toggling 'd' and 'reset' every 5 time units), and a testing loop that checks the flip-flop output for correctness relative to inputs ('d' compared to 'q' when not in reset) over 100 stimulus cycles, with results displayed each cycle. The testbench concludes by terminating the simulation after 100 cycles (`$finish` in the testing loop).",

The testbench generates a clock signal and randomly assigns values to the 'd' (data) input and 'reset' signal of the D flip-flop every 5 time units, using a task named \"stimulus\". It checks the functionality of the flip-flop by comparing its output 'q' with the input 'd' when the system is not in the reset state. If the values match, the test case passes and this is displayed; otherwise, a failure message is shown. The testbench runs this test repeatedly for 100 cycles and then finishes the simulation."

It is toggled between 1 and 0 based on the random stimuli generated in the testbench. The `clk` (clock) input provides the timing reference for the flip-flop, determining when the data at `d` should be sampled and potentially stored. The `reset` input is used to asynchronously reset the flip-flop's output to a known state before the beginning of the operation, also controlled by random stimuli in this testbench scenario.\n\nOutput ports: `q`, `qb`. \nExplanation: The output port `q` represents the primary output of the D flip-flop, which should ideally hold the value of the `d` input following a clock pulse, provided the flip-flop is not in the reset state. The `qb` output is typically the inverse of `q`, offering a complementary output state. In this testbench, the outputs `q` and `qb` are monitored to determine if the D flip-flop operates correctly under the provided stimuli, contributing to the pass or fail status displayed for each test case."

In the testbench, it is toggled continuously to simulate the clock operation.\n- `reset`: Used to asynchronously clear or reset the state of the D flip-flop to a known state regardless of other inputs.
