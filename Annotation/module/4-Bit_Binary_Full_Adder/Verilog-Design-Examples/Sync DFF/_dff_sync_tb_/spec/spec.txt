Module name: dff_sync_tb. Module specification: The dff_sync_tb is a Verilog testbench designed to verify the functionality of a synchronous D flip-flop. It instantiates a D flip-flop module (dff_sync) and tests its behavior over 100 cycles using random data and reset inputs. The module has three input ports: 'd' (data input to the flip-flop toggled randomly in the testbench), 'clk' (the clock signal that controls data sampling, toggled every unit time in the testbench), and 'reset' (asynchronously resets the flip-flop, also toggled randomly). The outputs are 'q' (the primary output reflecting the stored data value after the clock edge, unless reset) and 'qb' (the complement of 'q'). Internally, these input and output signals are utilized in several testbench blocks: a clock generator (`initial begin` block continuously toggling 'clk'), a stimulus task (randomly toggling 'd' and 'reset' every 5 time units), and a testing loop that checks the flip-flop output for correctness relative to inputs ('d' compared to 'q' when not in reset) over 100 stimulus cycles, with results displayed each cycle. The testbench concludes by terminating the simulation after 100 cycles (`$finish` in the testing loop).
