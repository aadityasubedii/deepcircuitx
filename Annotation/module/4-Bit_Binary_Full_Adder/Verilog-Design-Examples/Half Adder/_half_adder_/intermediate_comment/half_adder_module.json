    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"half_adder\" module performs single-bit binary addition, generating a sum (`o_sum`) and a carry (`o_carry`). It computes `o_sum` using an XOR of inputs `i_a` and `i_b`, and `o_carry` using an AND operation, directly assigning these results to outputs without intermediate signals. This efficient design facilitates integration into larger binary addition systems."
