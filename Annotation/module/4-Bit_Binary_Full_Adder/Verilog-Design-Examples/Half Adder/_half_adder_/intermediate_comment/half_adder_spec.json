    "spec": "Module name: half_adder. \nModule specification: The \"half_adder\" module is designed to perform the addition of two single-bit binary inputs, specifically focusing on generating a sum and a carry bit as outputs. It takes two input ports, `i_a` and `i_b`, which are the bits to be added. The module outputs two signals: `o_sum` and `o_carry`. The `o_sum` output is determined using an exclusive OR (XOR) operation on the inputs `i_a` and `i_b`, providing a binary sum where the bit is 1 only if `i_a` and `i_b` are different. The `o_carry` output uses an AND operation on the same inputs, yielding a binary 1 only when both `i_a` and `i_b` are 1; this represents the carry bit essential in multi-bit binary addition configurations. Internally, the module does not use any intermediate signals, directly assigning the results of the logical operations to the outputs. The Verilog code is structured simply, where the inputs and outputs are declared at the beginning, followed by the straight assignment of expressions to calculate `o_sum` and `o_carry`, efficiently summarizing the half adder's basic functionality without additional internal complexity.",
