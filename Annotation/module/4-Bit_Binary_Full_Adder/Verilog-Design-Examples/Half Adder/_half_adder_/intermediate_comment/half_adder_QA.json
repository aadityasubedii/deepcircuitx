A half adder performs the addition of two bits. The sum (`o_sum`) is the result of the exclusive OR (XOR) operation on `i_a` and `i_b`, which yields 1 when the bits are different and 0 when they are the same. The carry (`o_carry`) is the result of the AND operation on `i_a` and `i_b`, which yields 1 only when both bits are 1. This output is used as the carry bit in multi-bit addition architectures."

The operation for `o_sum` is an exclusive OR (XOR), which provides the sum of the two input bits, while `o_carry` is derived from an AND operation, giving the carry bit from the addition of the two inputs.
