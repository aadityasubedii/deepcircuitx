Module-level comment: The `half_adder_tb` module serves as a testbench for verifying a half adder's correct operation. It stimulates the DUT with random bits, compares the DUT's outputs to calculated expected values, and logs the results. Using an initial block for test iteration and a stimulus task for input generation and output verification, it ensures the half adder performs binary addition accurately.
