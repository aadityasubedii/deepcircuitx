    "spec": "Module name: half_adder_tb. Module specification: The `half_adder_tb` module is designed as a testbench to validate the functionality of a half adder, referred to as the Design Under Test (DUT) within this context. The module primarily targets stimulating the `half_adder` with random binary inputs `a` and `b`, and verifying its output against expected outcomes - the sum (`sum`) and carry out (`carry`). The input ports comprise `a` and `b`, which are single-bit input registers representing the binary digits for the addition operation undertaken by the half adder. The output ports include `sum` and `carry`, which are single-bit output wires intended to capture the results of the binary addition from the half adder - with `sum` indicating the addition result and `carry` signaling an overflow from the most significant bit. Internally, the module uses two signals, `new_sum` and `new_carry`, as registers to store the testbench-calculated sum and carry, serving the purpose of validating the accuracy of the DUT's output.\n\nThe code is structured into several key sections: instantiation of the `half_adder` (DUT), an initial block to drive the test procedure, and a task named `stimulus` responsible for generating random inputs and expected outputs. The initial block orchestrates the test sequence, invoking the `stimulus` task repeatedly to apply random inputs to the DUT and compare its response against the internally computed (`new_sum` and `new_carry`) expected results. The `stimulus` task itself seeds the DUT with random binary inputs and calculates the anticipated results using simple binary addition. The verification of the DUT's functionality is reported for each test case, highlighting whether the half adder's outputs align with the expected binary addition results.

The testbench stimulates the `half_adder` by generating random bits for its inputs `a` and `b` through a task named `stimulus`. It then checks if the output from the `half_adder` (`sum` and `carry`) matches the expected results (`new_sum` and `new_carry`) calculated within the testbench itself (`{new_carry, new_sum} = A + B`). This computation simulates the addition of two binary digits where `new_sum` represents the sum and `new_carry` represents the carry out of the addition. The testbench logs the results of each test case, indicating whether a test case has passed or failed by comparing the `half_adder`'s outputs with the calculated values. This process is repeated 10 times, with each iteration generating new random inputs for the half adder."
