The testbench stimulates the `half_adder` by generating random bits for its inputs `a` and `b` through a task named `stimulus`. It then checks if the output from the `half_adder` (`sum` and `carry`) matches the expected results (`new_sum` and `new_carry`) calculated within the testbench itself (`{new_carry, new_sum} = A + B`). This computation simulates the addition of two binary digits where `new_sum` represents the sum and `new_carry` represents the carry out of the addition. The testbench logs the results of each test case, indicating whether a test case has passed or failed by comparing the `half_adder`'s outputs with the calculated values. This process is repeated 10 times, with each iteration generating new random inputs for the half adder."
