    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'alu_tb' module serves as a testbench for verifying an ALU's functionality. It stimulates the ALU ('dut') with random inputs ('a', 'b', 'select') and checks the outputs ('out', flags) against expected results using an 'initial' block that runs 200 test cases. Each case is processed in the 'stimulus' task, which generates and applies inputs, comparing results after a 5-time unit delay, and reporting pass or fail statuses."
