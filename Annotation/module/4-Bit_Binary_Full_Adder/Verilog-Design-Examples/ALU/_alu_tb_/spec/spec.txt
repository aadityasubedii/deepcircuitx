Module name: alu_tb.

Module specification: The 'alu_tb' is a Verilog testbench module designed to test and verify the functionality of an instantiated Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) module named 'dut'. The testbench provides a series of random stimuli to the ALU's input ports 'a', 'b', and 'select', which are 4-bit operands and a 2-bit operation selector, respectively. The ALU's outputs consist of a 4-bit result 'out', along with flags for 'zero', 'carry', 'sign', 'parity', and 'overflow' conditions. These outputs are monitored and compared against expected outcomes to ensure the ALU's correct operation. Internal signals such as 'new_out', 'A', 'B', and 'Sl' hold the expected results and generated random values for testing. The code is structured into an 'initial' block that runs a test loop 200 times, invoking a 'stimulus' task that generates the random values and assigns them to the input ports. After a delay of 5 time units, the 'stimulus' task compares the expected result 'new_out' with the actual output 'out' and prints the status of the test case along with the relevant input and output values, indicating whether the test case passed or failed. The 'stimulus' task itself is responsible for value generation and assignment to properly execute each test iteration.
