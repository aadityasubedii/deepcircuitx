Module name: alu.
Module specification: The 'alu' module is a Verilog Representation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit designed to carry out basic arithmetic operations on two 4-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', directed by a 2-bit 'select' signal. The operations performed by the ALU include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, selected by 'select' values 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The output is a 4-bit vector 'out', which holds the result of the chosen operation. Alongside 'out', the module computes and sets flags such as 'zero' to indicate a zero result, 'carry' for carry-out information, 'sign' for result sign indication, 'parity' to indicate even parity, and 'overflow' to signal any overflow condition. No internal signals are declared or used, and all operations are conducted within an 'always' block that is sensitive to changes in inputs 'a' or 'b'. The case construct inside the always block evaluates the 'select' input to execute the corresponding arithmetic operation, and subsequent assignments update the flags based on the result stored in 'out'. The conditions provided for calculating flags are designed to reflect the States of the ALU after each operation correctly. This compact module provides a fundamental yet complete ALU operation set for educational or basic computational purposes.
