Module-level comment: The 'alu' module is a Verilog-based Arithmetic Logic Unit that operates on two 4-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', controlled by a 2-bit 'select'. It performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on 'select', outputting the result in 'out' and setting flags like 'zero', 'carry', 'sign', 'parity', and 'overflow'. All computations occur directly within an `always` block sensitive to 'a' and 'b', with direct flag updates following each arithmetic operation.
