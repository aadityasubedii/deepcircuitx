    "module": "Module-level comment: The `full_add_4bit` module performs 4-bit binary addition between inputs `i_a` and `i_b`, including an initial carry `i_cin`. It utilizes four cascaded `full_half_add_1bit` instances, each leveraging two `half_adder` modules for bit-wise addition and carry propagation, outputting the sum `o_sum` and final carry `o_carry`."
