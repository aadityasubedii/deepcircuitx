It outputs a 4-bit sum `o_sum` and a final carry `o_carry`. The logic involves chaining four instances of the `full_half_add_1bit` module, which itself incorporates the `half_adder` module twice for adding single bits with carry handling. The `half_adder` module performs a simple bit-wise addition of two bits, outputting the sum and carry for each bit. The `full_half_add_1bit` manages a full bit addition, including a carry in and providing a carry out, to be used in cascading adders like those in the `full_add_4bit` module."
