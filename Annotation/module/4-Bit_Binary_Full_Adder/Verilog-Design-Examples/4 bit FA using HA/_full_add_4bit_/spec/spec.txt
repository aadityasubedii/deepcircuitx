Module name: full_add_4bit.  
Module specification: The `full_add_4bit` module performs a 4-bit addition of two binary inputs `i_a` and `i_b`, considering an initial carry input `i_cin`. It outputs a 4-bit sum `o_sum` and a final carry `o_carry`. The inputs include `i_a [3:0]` and `i_b [3:0]` which are the two 4-bit numbers to be added, and `i_cin` which is the carry input from any previous computation or an external source. The outputs are `o_sum [3:0]`, representing the resultant sum, and `o_carry` for the carry-out which can be used as the carry-in for additional stages of extended addition. Within the module, three internal signals, namely `w_carry1`, `w_carry2`, and `w_carry3`, serve as inter-stage carry propagations between the cascaded instances of the `full_half_add_1bit` submodules. These submodules are instantiated four times corresponding to each bit of the operands, processing from the least significant to the most significant bit. Each `full_half_add_1bit` unit uses an underlying `half_adder` for fundamental bit-wise addition operations. This modular design efficiently manages bit-wise addition and carry forwarding, thus ensuring correct summation and carry propagation across all four bits.
