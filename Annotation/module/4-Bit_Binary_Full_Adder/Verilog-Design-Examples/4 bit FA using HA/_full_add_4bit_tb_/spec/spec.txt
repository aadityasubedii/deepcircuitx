Module name: full_add_4bit_tb. Module specification: The 'full_add_4bit_tb' is a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of a 4-bit full adder, modeled in the 'full_add_4bit' submodule. It employs random test vectors through input ports which include `a` and `b` (both 4-bit values representing numbers to be added) and `cin` (a single-bit representing the carry input). The outputs of the testbench are `sum` (a 4-bit output displaying the sum of `a`, `b`, and `cin`) and `carry` (a single-bit output showing the carry result of the addition). Internal to the testbench, `new_sum` and `new_carry` registers are used to store the expected results of the addition, calculated via software logic, for validation purposes. The module comprises the instantiation of the 'full_add_4bit' submodule connecting all the mentioned inputs and outputs, an initial block that drives 200 test iterations (`repeat(200)`), and a stimulus task that generates random inputs and expected results. Each test cycle, the actual outputs `sum` and `carry` from the 'full_add_4bit' submodule are compared against `new_sum` and `new_carry`. The comparison results, along with the test vectors, are output as either "Test case Passed" or "Test case Failed," illustrating the correctness of the tested hardware module under various conditions.
