    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'full_add_4bit_tb' serves as a Verilog testbench for a 4-bit full adder, testing it with random inputs (`a`, `b`, `cin`) and comparing its outputs (`sum`, `carry`) against software-calculated expectations (`new_sum`, `new_carry`). The module instantiates the adder design, iteratively applies stimulus, and reports pass/fail results based on output matches."
