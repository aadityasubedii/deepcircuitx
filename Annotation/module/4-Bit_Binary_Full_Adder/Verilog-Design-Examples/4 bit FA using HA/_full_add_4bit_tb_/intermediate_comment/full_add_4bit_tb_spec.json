Module specification: The 'full_add_4bit_tb' is a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of a 4-bit full adder, modeled in the 'full_add_4bit' submodule. It employs random test vectors through input ports which include `a` and `b` (both 4-bit values representing numbers to be added) and `cin` (a single-bit representing the carry input). The outputs of the testbench are `sum` (a 4-bit output displaying the sum of `a`, `b`, and `cin`) and `carry` (a single-bit output showing the carry result of the addition). Internal to the testbench, `new_sum` and `new_carry` registers are used to store the expected results of the addition, calculated via software logic, for validation purposes. The module comprises the instantiation of the 'full_add_4bit' submodule connecting all the mentioned inputs and outputs, an initial block that drives 200 test iterations (`repeat(200)`), and a stimulus task that generates random inputs and expected results. Each test cycle, the actual outputs `sum` and `carry` from the 'full_add_4bit' submodule are compared against `new_sum` and `new_carry`. The comparison results, along with the test vectors, are output as either \"Test case Passed\" or \"Test case Failed,\" illustrating the correctness of the tested hardware module under various conditions.",

The module checks if the hardware-generated outputs (`sum` and `carry`) match the expected outputs (`new_sum` and `new_carry`) calculated using software methods within the testbench itself.
