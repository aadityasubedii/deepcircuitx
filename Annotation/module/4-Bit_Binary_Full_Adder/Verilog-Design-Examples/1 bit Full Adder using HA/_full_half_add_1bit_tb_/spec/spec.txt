Module name: full_half_add_1bit_tb. Module specification: The `full_half_add_1bit_tb` is a Verilog testbench designed to validate the functionality of a 1-bit full and half adder, `full_half_add_1bit`, by subjecting it to multiple test cases with random input values. The module incorporates three input ports: `a` and `b` which are the primary operands for the addition operation, and `cin` that represents the carry-in bit; and two output ports: `sum` which provides the result of the bitwise addition, and `carry` that denotes the carry-out bit, potentially used for chaining in multi-bit adder configurations. Internal to the testbench, it uses registers `new_sum` and `new_carry` to hold the expected results for the sum and carry, respectively, facilitating result verification against the outputs from the Device Under Test (DUT). The testbench itself consists of an initial block that performs the testing loop 100 times using randomized inputs for `a`, `b`, and `cin`. Each iteration involves calling a `stimulus` task that assigns random values to the inputs and computes the expected results. It then assesses whether the outputs from the DUT match the expected `new_sum` and `new_carry`, logging the outcome accordingly. The module concludes its operation with the `$finish` directive after completing all test iterations.
