    "module": "Module-level comment: The `full_half_add_1bit_tb` module is a testbench for verifying a 1-bit full and half adder, generating random inputs (`a`, `b`, `cin`) and comparing DUT outputs (`sum`, `carry`) against expected results (`new_sum`, `new_carry`). Using 100 test iterations, it determines pass/fail outcomes, aiding in robust adder verification. The verdicts are displayed, concluding with a simulation termination."
