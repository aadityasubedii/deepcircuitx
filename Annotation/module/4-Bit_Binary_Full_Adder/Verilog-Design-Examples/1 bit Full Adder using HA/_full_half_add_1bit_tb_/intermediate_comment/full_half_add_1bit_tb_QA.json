The testbench uses a `repeat` loop to perform the test 100 times with different random input values of `a`, `b`, and `cin`. In each iteration, it uses a task named `stimulus` to provide random values to inputs (`a`, `b`, `cin`) and to compute the expected results (`new_sum`, `new_carry`) by performing the addition operation on the random inputs. Then it compares the expected results with the actual output from the Device Under Test (DUT), which is an instance of the `full_half_add_1bit` module. Successful comparisons indicate that the DUT has passed the test case and the test bench logs this as \"Test case Passed\"; otherwise, it logs \"Test case Failed\". After running the tests, the simulation is finished with the `$finish` statement."
