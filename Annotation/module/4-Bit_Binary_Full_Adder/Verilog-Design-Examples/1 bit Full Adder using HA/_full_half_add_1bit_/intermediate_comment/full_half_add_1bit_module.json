    "module": "Module-level comment: The `full_half_add_1bit` module implements a 1-bit full adder using two `half_adder` instances. It adds two input bits (`i_a`, `i_b`) and a carry-in (`i_cin`), producing a sum (`o_sum`) and carry-out (`o_carry`). The first half adder computes an intermediate sum and carry; the second adds the intermediate sum to `i_cin`, finalizing the sum and determining the carry-out through an OR operation between the two carries."
