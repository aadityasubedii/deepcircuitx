It takes three inputs: i_a, i_b (the bits to be added), and i_cin (the carry input). It produces two outputs: o_sum (the sum of the inputs) and o_carry (the output carry). The first half adder computes the preliminary sum and carry using inputs i_a and i_b. The second half adder takes the output of the first half adder and adds the carry input (i_cin) to compute the final sum and an additional carry. The final carry output (o_carry) is the logical OR of the carry outputs from both half adders. This design efficiently handles the addition logic associated with binary numbers using basic logical components arranged to model typical arithmetic operations in digital systems."

Explanation: The input ports `i_a` and `i_b` represent the two 1-bit values to be added together. `i_cin` is the carry-in bit, which is an additional input used in the calculation of the sum when multiple 1-bit full adders are cascaded to form an adder capable of handling numbers larger than 1 bit.\n\nOutput ports: o_sum, o_carry. Explanation: `o_sum` is the output port that represents the sum resulting from the addition of the input bits `i_a`, `i_b`, and the carry-in bit `i_cin`. `o_carry` is the output carry bit, indicating whether there was an overflow from the most significant bit of the sum. This carry-out bit is essential when multiple 1-bit full adders are linked to process multi-bit addition, as it serves as the carry-in input to the next significant position."
