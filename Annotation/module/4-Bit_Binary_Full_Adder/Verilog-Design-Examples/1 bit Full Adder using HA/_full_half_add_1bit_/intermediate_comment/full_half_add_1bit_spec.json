    "spec": "Module name: full_half_add_1bit. Module specification: The `full_half_add_1bit` module is designed to perform the function of a 1-bit full adder by using two instances of half adders. It effectively calculates the sum of two input bits, `i_a` and `i_b`, along with a carry-in bit, `i_cin`. The module provides two outputs: `o_sum`, which represents the 1-bit sum, and `o_carry`, the carry-out bit indicating an overflow from the addition. The module utilizes three internal signals, `w_sum1`, `w_carry1`, and `w_carry2`, which are critical for its operation. `w_sum1` is an intermediate sum from the first half adder, `w_carry1` is the carry output from the same half adder, and `w_carry2` is the carry from the addition performed by the second half adder on `w_sum1` and `i_cin`. These signals help facilitate the final sum and carry calculation in a cascading adder setup. The module consists of two main blocks: the `half_adder` submodules named `h1` and `h2`. The first block, `h1`, performs the initial sum and carry computation using `i_a` and `i_b`, while the second block, `h2`, adds the result `w_sum1` to `i_cin` to generate the final sum (`o_sum`) and an additional carry (`w_carry2`). The final carry out (`o_carry`) is derived from an OR operation between the two half adder carries (`w_carry1` and `w_carry2`). The code is clearly separated into the `full_half_add_1bit` adder module and a supporting `half_adder` module, each encapsulating its respective functionality and contributing to the addition operation. The `half_adder` is a foundational unit using XOR and AND operations to produce the sum and carry of two single binary digits, manifested in the module twice to achieve the full adder capabilities.",
