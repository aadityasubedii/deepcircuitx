    "module": "Module-level comment: The `asyncfifo_tb` module acts as a testbench for an asynchronous FIFO, simulating write and read operations under various clock frequencies and control signal conditions. It establishes write and read clocks to test asynchronous behavior, employs reset logic, and defines tasks for FIFO operations. Signal assertions and task invocations test the FIFO's data handling, providing status output checking for full/empty conditions, and data integrity through the `out` signal."
