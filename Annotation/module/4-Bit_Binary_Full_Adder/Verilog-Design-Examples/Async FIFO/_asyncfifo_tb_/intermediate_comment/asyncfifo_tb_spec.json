It manages this by employing separate clock signals for writing (`write_clk`) and reading (`read_clk`) to mimic asynchronous operation, in addition to using control signals such as `reset` for initializing the FIFO, `write_en` for enabling write operations, and `read_en` for enabling read operations. The input data (`data_in`) is an 8-bit wide signal intended for FIFO storage, testing the FIFO\u2019s handling of data under different conditions. The outputs monitored are `mem_full` and `mem_empty`, indicating whether the FIFO is full or empty, respectively, and `out`, which is an 8-bit signal outputting the data read from the FIFO. Internally, the module uses these signals to drive the instantiation of the FIFO under test, simulate reset conditions, and generate varying conditions for writing and reading through tasks (`write_task` and `read_task`). The initial blocks instantiate the clocks with distinct periods to simulate the asynchronous behavior, perform a reset operation, and sequentially execute write and read tasks which also display key signal states for debugging purposes.

The test scenarios are driven by different clock signals for writing (write_clk) and reading (read_clk), along with specific control signals such as write enable (write_en), read enable (read_en), and reset.

It governs the timing of when data can be written into the FIFO.\n- `read_clk`: This is the clock signal used for read operations from the FIFO. It controls the timing of when data can be read from the FIFO.\n- `reset`: This is an input signal used to reset the FIFO to an initial state. When asserted, it clears the FIFO contents and resets the status flags.\n- `write_en`: This is the write enable signal. When asserted, it allows data to be written into the FIFO on the rising edge of `write_clk`.\n- `read_en`: This is the read enable signal. When asserted, it allows data to be read from the FIFO on the rising edge of `read_clk`.\n- `data_in`: This is the input data signal, which is an 8-bit wide bus that carries the data to be written into the FIFO.\n\nOutput ports: `mem_full`, `mem_empty`, `out`.\nExplanation:\n- `mem_full`: This is a status output signal that indicates whether the FIFO is full.
