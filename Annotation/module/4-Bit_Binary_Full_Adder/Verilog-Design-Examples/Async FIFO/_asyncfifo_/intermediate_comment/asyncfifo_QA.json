The FIFO has an 8-byte depth with 8-bit wide data, uses write and read pointers to keep track of the storage positions, and includes full and empty flags. Write operations occur on the rising edge of the `write_clk` and are gated by `write_en` and not being full. Read operations occur on the rising edge of the `read_clk`, gated by `read_en` and not being empty. The `reset` is asynchronously controlling the initialization of pointers and count. The count keeps track of the number of elements in the FIFO, increasing on writes, and decreasing on reads. The FIFO handles `reset` conditions and pointer wrapping appropriately but doesn't include overflow or underflow protection in the provided snippet beyond the full and empty flags."

It triggers the write logic of the FIFO on its rising edge.\n- `read_clk`: The clock signal for the read operations. It triggers the read logic of the FIFO on its rising edge.\n- `reset`: An asynchronous reset signal used to initialize the FIFO's pointers and count to their default states, effectively clearing the FIFO.\n- `write_en`: Write enable signal. When high (`1`), it allows data to be written into the FIFO, provided it's not full.\n- `read_en`: Read enable signal. When high (`1`), it allows data to be read from the FIFO, provided it's not empty.\n- `data_in`: The 8-bit wide input data to be written into the FIFO when a write operation occurs.\n\nOutput ports: `mem_full, mem_empty, out`.\nExplanation: \n- `mem_full`: Indicates that the FIFO is full and cannot accept further write requests. It's high (`1`) when the FIFO is full.\n- `mem_empty`: Indicates that the FIFO is empty and no data is available to be read. It's high (`1`) when the FIFO is empty.\n- `out`: The 8-bit wide output data. It presents the data read from the FIFO when a read operation occurs."

It points to the location where the next byte of data should be written into the FIFO and is incremented after each write.\n- `read_ptr`: A 3-bit wide pointer similar to `write_ptr`, but used for read operations from the FIFO. It points to the location of the next byte of data to be read and is incremented after each read.\n- `count`: A 4-bit wide binary counter indicating the number of valid entries in the FIFO.
