    "module": "Module-level comment: The asyncfifo module implements an asynchronous FIFO buffer for systems with separate read and write clock domains. It features input and output management for FIFO operations, using pointers and a counter to track and control data flow. Memory array for storage, pointer incrementation on read/write, and count adjustment ensure proper FIFO functionality across differing clock speeds without detailed overflow/underflow protection."
