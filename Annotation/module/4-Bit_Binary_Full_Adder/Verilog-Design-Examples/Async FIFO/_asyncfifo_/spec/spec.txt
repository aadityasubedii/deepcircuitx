Module name: asyncfifo. 
Module specification: The asyncfifo module is designed to implement an asynchronous FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer that operates with separate read and write clock domains, enabling it to manage data queues in systems where read and write speeds differ. It features input ports such as `write_clk` (write operations clock), `read_clk` (read operations clock), `reset` (asynchronous reset signal for initializing FIFO), `write_en` (write enable signal), `read_en` (read enable signal), and `data_in` (8-bit input data for the FIFO). The output ports include `mem_full` (indicates the FIFO is full), `mem_empty` (indicates the FIFO is empty), and `out` (8-bit wide output data read from the FIFO). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `mem` (a memory array of 8 registers each 8 bits wide for FIFO storage), `write_ptr` and `read_ptr` (3-bit pointers for addressing the memory array during write and read operations, respectively), and `count` (a 4-bit counter indicating the number of valid entries in the FIFO). 

The module is organized into three main blocks: 
1. The first block is sensitive to the `write_clk` or `negedge reset` and manages write operations by updating the write pointer and maintaining the output as high impedance (`z`) when a write occurs unless the FIFO is full. 
2. The second block, triggered by `read_clk` or `negedge reset`, handles read operations by updating the read pointer and outputting the desired data unless the FIFO is empty. 
3. The third block responds to changes in either `write_clk`, `read_clk`, or `negedge reset` to adjust the `count` based on successful read or write operations, indicating the FIFO's current occupancy. 

This structure ensures the FIFO operates correctly across differing clock domains for read and write operations, featuring mechanisms for straightforward FIFO management without overflow or underflow protection beyond the basic full and empty flags.
