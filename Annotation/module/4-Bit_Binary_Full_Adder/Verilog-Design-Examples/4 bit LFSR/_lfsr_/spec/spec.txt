Module name: lfsr. Module specification: The 'lfsr' (Linear Feedback Shift Register) module generates a pseudo-random sequence using a 4-bit shift register mechanism controlled by a clock signal and a reset signal. The module has two input ports: 'reset' and 'clk'. The 'reset' input initializes or resets the state of the LFSR to 1 when active, ensuring a non-zero start state which is essential for the LFSR operation. The 'clk' (clock) input synchronizes the shifting operations to occur at the rising edges of the clock cycles. It features one output port: 'data_out', a 4-bit register that holds and outputs the current state of the LFSR. Internally, the module uses a wire 'next_bit' calculated by an XOR operation between the zeroth and the first bits of the 'data_out' register. This bit is pivotal in the LFSR's feedback mechanism where, on each positive clock edge, 'data_out' is either reset to 1 or updated by shifting its bits to the right and inserting 'next_bit' at the most significant bit position. This mechanism ensures continuous generation of pseudo-random sequences as long as the module is not in a reset state and 'data_out' is non-zero.
