    "spec": "Module name: lfsr. Module specification: The 'lfsr' (Linear Feedback Shift Register) module generates a pseudo-random sequence using a 4-bit shift register mechanism controlled by a clock signal and a reset signal. The module has two input ports: 'reset' and 'clk'. The 'reset' input initializes or resets the state of the LFSR to 1 when active, ensuring a non-zero start state which is essential for the LFSR operation. The 'clk' (clock) input synchronizes the shifting operations to occur at the rising edges of the clock cycles. It features one output port: 'data_out', a 4-bit register that holds and outputs the current state of the LFSR. Internally, the module uses a wire 'next_bit' calculated by an XOR operation between the zeroth and the first bits of the 'data_out' register. This bit is pivotal in the LFSR's feedback mechanism where, on each positive clock edge, 'data_out' is either reset to 1 or updated by shifting its bits to the right and inserting 'next_bit' at the most significant bit position. This mechanism ensures continuous generation of pseudo-random sequences as long as the module is not in a reset state and 'data_out' is non-zero.",

The code uses an XOR operation between the first and second bits of the `data_out` register to compute the `next_bit`. This bit is then used during the positive edge of the clock cycle in conjunction with the reset condition to update `data_out`. If the reset signal is high or `data_out` is zero, `data_out` is set to 1. Otherwise, `data_out` is formed by concatenating `next_bit` with the three most significant bits of the current `data_out`, effectively shifting the bits to the right and introducing `next_bit` at the most significant position. This behavior ensures the shift register continues to iterate over its states, governed by the feedback from the XOR operation."
