    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"lfsr_tb\" module serves as a Verilog testbench for an LFSR, generating clock and reset signals to simulate and verify the device's behavior. It mimics an LFSR internally with 'new_out', compares its outputs to the actual 'dut' LFSR instance, and reports pass/fail status based on output matches post-initialization and per clock cycle."
