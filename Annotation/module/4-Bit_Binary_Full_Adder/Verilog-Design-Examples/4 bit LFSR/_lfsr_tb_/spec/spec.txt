Module name: lfsr_tb. Module specification: The "lfsr_tb" is a Verilog testbench for verifying the functionality of a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). It provides two input ports, `reset` and `clk`. The `reset` input is used to initialize the system to a known state, whereas the `clk` (clock) input drives the timing of operations within the module, toggling every 5 units of time as defined. The output ports include a 4-bit `data_out`, which is connected to the output of the `dut`, the LFSR being tested, and `new_bit`, a signal derived by XORing the least significant two bits of `new_out` to compute the next expected bit for verification purposes. Internal signals include a 4-bit `new_out` register, which mirrors the `dut` output and assists in verification by generating new values based on the `new_bit` computation, and `dut`, the instance of the LFSR module under test. The code is organized into blocks including: an initial block that sets up and toggles the clock, another initial block for handling the reset signal and simulation termination, an assign statement for `new_bit`, and an always block triggered on the clock's rising edge that handles the `new_out` update and compares it with `data_out` to determine test outcomes, providing on-the-fly verification results.
