Module name: mealy_nonol
Module specification: The 'mealy_nonol' module embodies a Mealy finite state machine (FSM) with a configuration of four states: S0, S1, S2, and S3. This FSM features an input signal 'in' that steers state transitions, a synchronized 'clk' signal prompting state changes on its positive edge, and a 'reset' signal to reinitialize the machine to state S0 when a positive edge is detected. The module outputs a signal 'out', which is primarily 0 but can be set to 1 during a transition from state S3 back to S0, contingent on the 'in' signal being high. Inside the module, two internal 2-bit registers named 'present_state' and 'next_state' are key components that facilitate the FSM's operation. 'present_state' holds the FSM's current state and is updated either by the clock 'clk' or by a reset event, whereas 'next_state' computes the subsequent state to transition into based on 'present_state' and the 'in' input. The code features two principal always blocks: the first block handles state updates triggered by the clock or reset signal, and the second block, which executes concurrently, defines state transition logic and the output signal behavior based on the current state and the 'in' input. This module's design ensures that the FSM operates synchronously with the clock signal while responding to input signals and reset events in a controlled and predictable manner.
