    "spec": "Module name: mealy_nonol\nModule specification: The 'mealy_nonol' module embodies a Mealy finite state machine (FSM) with a configuration of four states: S0, S1, S2, and S3. This FSM features an input signal 'in' that steers state transitions, a synchronized 'clk' signal prompting state changes on its positive edge, and a 'reset' signal to reinitialize the machine to state S0 when a positive edge is detected. The module outputs a signal 'out', which is primarily 0 but can be set to 1 during a transition from state S3 back to S0, contingent on the 'in' signal being high. Inside the module, two internal 2-bit registers named 'present_state' and 'next_state' are key components that facilitate the FSM's operation. 'present_state' holds the FSM's current state and is updated either by the clock 'clk' or by a reset event, whereas 'next_state' computes the subsequent state to transition into based on 'present_state' and the 'in' input. The code features two principal always blocks: the first block handles state updates triggered by the clock or reset signal, and the second block, which executes concurrently, defines state transition logic and the output signal behavior based on the current state and the 'in' input. This module's design ensures that the FSM operates synchronously with the clock signal while responding to input signals and reset events in a controlled and predictable manner.",

It has one input 'in', a clock signal 'clk', and a reset signal 'reset'. The output of the module is 'out'. The state machine transitions between states based on the value of the input 'in'. On the positive edge of the reset signal, the machine is set to state S0. On the positive edge of the clock signal and if reset is not active, the present state transitions to the stored 'next_state'. The output 'out' is mainly set to 0 except when transitioning from S3 to S0, and in this case, if 'in' is 1, 'out' is set to 1; otherwise it stays at 0. The state transitions are such that from S0, if 'in' is 1, it moves to S1, otherwise it stays in S0. From S1, it goes to S2 if 'in' is 1, otherwise back to S0. In S2, it stays in S2 if 'in' is 1; if not, it goes to S3. From S3, the machine always goes back to S0, outputting 1 if 'in' is high, else outputs 0."
