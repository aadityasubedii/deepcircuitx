It has one input 'in', a clock signal 'clk', and a reset signal 'reset'. The output of the module is 'out'. The state machine transitions between states based on the value of the input 'in'. On the positive edge of the reset signal, the machine is set to state S0. On the positive edge of the clock signal and if reset is not active, the present state transitions to the stored 'next_state'. The output 'out' is mainly set to 0 except when transitioning from S3 to S0, and in this case, if 'in' is 1, 'out' is set to 1; otherwise it stays at 0. The state transitions are such that from S0, if 'in' is 1, it moves to S1, otherwise it stays in S0. From S1, it goes to S2 if 'in' is 1, otherwise back to S0. In S2, it stays in S2 if 'in' is 1; if not, it goes to S3. From S3, the machine always goes back to S0, outputting 1 if 'in' is high, else outputs 0."

The 'reset' port is used for resetting the state machine to its initial state (S0) on a positive edge.\n\nOutput ports: out.\nExplanation: The 'out' port is the output signal of the state machine.
