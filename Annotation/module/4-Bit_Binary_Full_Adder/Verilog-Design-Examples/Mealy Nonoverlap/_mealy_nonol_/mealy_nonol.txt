Module-level comment: The 'mealy_nonol' module implements a Mealy FSM with four states (S0 to S3) controlled by the input 'in', clock 'clk', and reset 'reset'. It features a mechanism where 'present_state' dictates the current state, 'next_state' defines transitions based on inputs, and the output 'out' is determined by these states. The FSM transitions on 'clk' edges and is reset on 'reset' edges, ensuring synchronized state progression and output response.
