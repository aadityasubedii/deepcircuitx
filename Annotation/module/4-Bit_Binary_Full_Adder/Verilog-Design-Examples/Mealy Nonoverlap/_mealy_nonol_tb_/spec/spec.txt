Module name: mealy_nonol_tb.
Module specification: The mealy_nonol_tb module serves as a testbench for a Mealy machine, specifically designed for sequence detection (1101), and is named "mealy_nonol". Its functional role is to generate test stimulus for the DUT, compare expected and actual output signals, handle reset conditions, and provide a test report. It utilizes three input ports: 'in' for the binary sequence input to the state machine; 'clk' as a clock signal ensuring synchronous operations; and 'reset' for initializing the system to a predetermined starting state. The sole output port, 'out', conveys the Mealy machine's response based on its current state and input. Internal signals include 'new_out', computing the expected output as a register; 'ps', which signifies the Mealy machine's current state; and 'ns', representing the next computed state. The code is partitioned into various functional blocks: initial blocks to establish clock and reset behaviors, a repeat loop to iterate stimulus generation and test verification, a task for generating random input at clock edges, and always-blocks for state transition management and expected output computation. The testbench emphasizes verification by matching 'new_out' with 'out' and indicating successful sequence detection when both are high. Upon discrepancies, it reports a test failure, aiding in the effective evaluation of the Mealy machine's performance.
