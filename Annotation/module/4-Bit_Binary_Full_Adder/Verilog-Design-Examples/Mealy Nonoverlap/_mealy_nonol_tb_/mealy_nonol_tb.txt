Module-level comment: The "mealy_nonol_tb" module tests a Mealy machine (DUT) sequence detector. It generates stimulus, manages clock and reset, compares expected ('new_out') to actual output ('out'), and reports test results. Testbench utilizes an FSM with states 'ps' and 'ns' for verifying sequence detection and output correctness under varied inputs.
