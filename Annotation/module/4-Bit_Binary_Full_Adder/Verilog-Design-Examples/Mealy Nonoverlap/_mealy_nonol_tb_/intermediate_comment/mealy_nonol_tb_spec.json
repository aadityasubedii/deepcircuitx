    "spec": "Module name: mealy_nonol_tb.\nModule specification: The mealy_nonol_tb module serves as a testbench for a Mealy machine, specifically designed for sequence detection (1101), and is named \"mealy_nonol\". Its functional role is to generate test stimulus for the DUT, compare expected and actual output signals, handle reset conditions, and provide a test report. It utilizes three input ports: 'in' for the binary sequence input to the state machine; 'clk' as a clock signal ensuring synchronous operations; and 'reset' for initializing the system to a predetermined starting state. The sole output port, 'out', conveys the Mealy machine's response based on its current state and input. Internal signals include 'new_out', computing the expected output as a register; 'ps', which signifies the Mealy machine's current state; and 'ns', representing the next computed state. The code is partitioned into various functional blocks: initial blocks to establish clock and reset behaviors, a repeat loop to iterate stimulus generation and test verification, a task for generating random input at clock edges, and always-blocks for state transition management and expected output computation. The testbench emphasizes verification by matching 'new_out' with 'out' and indicating successful sequence detection when both are high. Upon discrepancies, it reports a test failure, aiding in the effective evaluation of the Mealy machine's performance.",

The state transitions and output of this Mealy machine are determined by the current state and the input signal. The testbench stimulates the system by generating random inputs, clock signals, and managing resets. It compares the output from the Device Under Test (DUT) to an expected output (\"new_out\") calculated within the testbench. If the actual output matches the expected output, the test case passes, and it displays a message indicating success; otherwise, it indicates a failure. Additionally, when a specific condition is met (both the actual and expected outputs are '1'), it signals that a particular sequence (1101) is detected. This process aims to assess whether the Mealy machine behaves as intended across various input sequences."

Its functional role is to generate test stimulus for the DUT, compare expected and actual output signals, handle reset conditions, and provide a test report. It utilizes three input ports: 'in' for the binary sequence input to the state machine; 'clk' as a clock signal ensuring synchronous operations; and 'reset' for initializing the system to a predetermined starting state. The sole output port, 'out', conveys the Mealy machine's response based on its current state and input. Internal signals include 'new_out', computing the expected output as a register; 'ps', which signifies the Mealy machine's current state; and 'ns', representing the next computed state. The code is partitioned into various functional blocks: initial blocks to establish clock and reset behaviors, a repeat loop to iterate stimulus generation and test verification, a task for generating random input at clock edges, and always-blocks for state transition management and expected output computation. The testbench emphasizes verification by matching 'new_out' with 'out' and indicating successful sequence detection when both are high. Upon discrepancies, it reports a test failure, aiding in the effective evaluation of the Mealy machine's performance."
