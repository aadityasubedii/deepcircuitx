The Mealy machine is expected to detect a specific binary sequence based on the input it receives. The state transitions and output of this Mealy machine are determined by the current state and the input signal. The testbench stimulates the system by generating random inputs, clock signals, and managing resets. It compares the output from the Device Under Test (DUT) to an expected output (\"new_out\") calculated within the testbench. If the actual output matches the expected output, the test case passes, and it displays a message indicating success; otherwise, it indicates a failure. Additionally, when a specific condition is met (both the actual and expected outputs are '1'), it signals that a particular sequence (1101) is detected. This process aims to assess whether the Mealy machine behaves as intended across various input sequences."
