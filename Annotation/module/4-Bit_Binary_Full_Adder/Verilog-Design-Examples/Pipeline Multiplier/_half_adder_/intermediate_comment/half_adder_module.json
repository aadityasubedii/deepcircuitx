    "module": "Module-level comment: The `half_adder` module performs single-bit binary addition of inputs `a` and `b`. It outputs `sum`, derived from an XOR operation (a^b), representing non-carry addition, and `carry`, from an AND operation (a&b), indicating carry-out presence. The functionality is directly implemented using two `assign` statements for efficiency and clarity."
