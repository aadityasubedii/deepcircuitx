Module name: half_adder. Module specification: The `half_adder` module is designed to perform basic binary addition on two single-bit inputs, `a` and `b`. It calculates and outputs two bits: `sum` and `carry`. The `sum` output is the result of an XOR operation between `a` and `b`, which provides the sum of `a` and `b` excluding the carry, useful for single bit arithmetic. The `carry` output is derived from an AND operation between `a` and `b`, indicating a carry-out bit, which is high (1) when both inputs are high. The module does not utilize internal signals, with computations conducted directly through assignments in the code. Specifically, there are two `assign` statements, one determining the `sum` and the other specifying the `carry`, concisely encapsulating the moduleâ€™s functionality. This structure ensures clarity and efficiency in implementing a fundamental half-adder logic circuit.
