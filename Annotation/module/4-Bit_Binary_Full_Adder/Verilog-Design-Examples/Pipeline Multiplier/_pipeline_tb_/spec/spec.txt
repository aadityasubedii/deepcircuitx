Module name: pipeline_tb. Module specification: The `pipeline_tb` module serves as a testbench for simulating and verifying the functionality of a `pipeline` module, which is responsible for computing the product of two 64-bit numbers. The primary inputs include two 64-bit registers `x` and `y` that supply the values to be multiplied, a clock signal `clk` that synchronizes operations, and a reset signal `reset` that initializes the pipeline module to a known state. The testbench outputs the 128-bit result `prod` which is the computed product from the pipeline module. Internally, the `clk` signal is configured to toggle every 5 time units, simulating a clock pulse for the system. The `reset` signal is initially set high for 10 time units, then set low to allow normal operation of the pipeline. During simulation, values are continuously assigned to `x` and `y`, and the module waits for a clock edge before displaying both the expected and actual product results to verify correctness. This process repeats five times, followed by a 100-time unit wait before the simulation finishes. This design effectively tests the pipeline's ability to perform multiplications under controlled simulation conditions.
