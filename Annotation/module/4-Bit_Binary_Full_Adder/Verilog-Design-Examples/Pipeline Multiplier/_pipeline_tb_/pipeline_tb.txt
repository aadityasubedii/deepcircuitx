Module-level comment: The `pipeline_tb` module is a testbench for verifying a multiplication operation in a `pipeline` design. It stimulates the `pipeline` with a clock signal, reset process, and predefined inputs `x` and `y`. It checks the multiplication result `prod` against directly calculated products at each clock cycle, repeating the test five times to ensure accuracy.
