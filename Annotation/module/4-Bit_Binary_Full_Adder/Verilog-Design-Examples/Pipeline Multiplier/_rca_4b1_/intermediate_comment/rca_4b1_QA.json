It utilizes four instances of a sub-module 'rca_1b', each responsible for one bit of the addition process, thereby adding corresponding bits from each number along with a carry propagated from the previous less significant bit. The sum produced is a 4-bit output, and an additional carry output indicates overflow beyond 4 bits."
