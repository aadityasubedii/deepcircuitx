Module name: rca_4b1. 

Module specification: The 'rca_4b1' module is a 4-bit ripple carry adder that performs binary addition on two 4-bit inputs, 'a' and 'b', taking into account an additional carry-in bit 'cin'. It outputs a 4-bit sum 'sum' and a carry-out 'cout' to flag overflow or to serve as a carry-in for an extended adder chain. The input ports consist of '[3:0]a' and '[3:0]b' which are the binary numbers to add, and 'cin', a single bit for the initial carry-in. The outputs include '[3:0]sum', the sum of the inputs and 'cout', the final carry-out. Internal signals consist of a 3-bit wire array 'c[2:0]', which are used to propagate the intermediate carries between the four 1-bit adder stages. These stages are instantiated as 'rca_1b' modules, where 'rca_1b r1' adds the least significant bits, 'rca_1b r2' adds the second least significant bits, 'rca_1b r3' adds the mid significant bits, and 'rca_1b r4' adds the most significant bits of 'a' and 'b'. The 'rca_1b' sub-modules use XOR and AND logic to compute the sum and carry-out for each bit, contributing to the complete 4-bit addition with ripple carry propagation.
