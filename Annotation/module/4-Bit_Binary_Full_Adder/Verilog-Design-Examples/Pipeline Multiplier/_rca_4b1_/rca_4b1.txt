Module-level comment: The 'rca_4b1' module is a 4-bit ripple carry adder that computes the sum of two 4-bit inputs ('a' and 'b') and a carry-in ('cin'). It outputs a 4-bit sum ('sum') and a carry-out ('cout'). Internally, it employs four 'rca_1b' sub-modules, each handling the addition of individual bit pairs, using XOR for sum and AND for carry, facilitating carry propagation across the bits.
