Module name: vdcmul_32b. Module specification: The 'vdcmul_32b' module is designed for multiplying two 32-bit unsigned integers, 'x' and 'y', to produce a 64-bit product 'prod'. It intricately uses four instances of a submodule 'vdcmul_16b' to compute the partial products (pp1, pp2, pp3, pp4) of 16-bit sections of the inputs, and then combines these using Ripple Carry Adders (rca32b) and a half adder. The input ports of the module are 'x' and 'y', both 32 bits wide, serving as the multiplicant and the multiplier, respectively. The output port, 'prod', is 64 bits wide, delivering the final multiplication result. Internal signals include 32-bit wires for the partial products (pp1 to pp4), carries (c1, c2, c3), a sum (s1) and a carry (ca1) from a half adder, as well as intermediate sums (sum1 to sum3) used in the addition phases. The module is partitioned into sections for partial product generation (via 'vdcmul_16b'), partial sum computation and carry handling (via 'rca32b' and 'half_adder'), leading to the assembly of the final product. This structured approach decomposes the complex 64-bit multiplication into manageable operations, facilitating efficiency and clarity in digital arithmetic processing.
