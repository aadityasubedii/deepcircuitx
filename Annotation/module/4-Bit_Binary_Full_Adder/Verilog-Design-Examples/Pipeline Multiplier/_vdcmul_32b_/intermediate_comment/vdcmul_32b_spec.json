    "spec": "Module name: vdcmul_32b. Module specification: The 'vdcmul_32b' module is designed for multiplying two 32-bit unsigned integers, 'x' and 'y', to produce a 64-bit product 'prod'. It intricately uses four instances of a submodule 'vdcmul_16b' to compute the partial products (pp1, pp2, pp3, pp4) of 16-bit sections of the inputs, and then combines these using Ripple Carry Adders (rca32b) and a half adder. The input ports of the module are 'x' and 'y', both 32 bits wide, serving as the multiplicant and the multiplier, respectively. The output port, 'prod', is 64 bits wide, delivering the final multiplication result. Internal signals include 32-bit wires for the partial products (pp1 to pp4), carries (c1, c2, c3), a sum (s1) and a carry (ca1) from a half adder, as well as intermediate sums (sum1 to sum3) used in the addition phases. The module is partitioned into sections for partial product generation (via 'vdcmul_16b'), partial sum computation and carry handling (via 'rca32b' and 'half_adder'), leading to the assembly of the final product. This structured approach decomposes the complex 64-bit multiplication into manageable operations, facilitating efficiency and clarity in digital arithmetic processing.",

The module divides the multiplication process into parts by using four instances of a smaller multiplier 'vdcmul_16b' to handle 16-bit pieces of the inputs. The partial products from these instances are then combined and adjusted using the Ripple Carry Adders (rca32b) and a half adder to correctly compute the final full 64-bit product. The use of smaller multipliers and subsequent aggregation simplifies handling of the large bit-width operations, modularizes the design for possibly easier maintenance, and might improve performance concerning hardware layout and timing."

These partial products are intermediate values used to calculate the final 64-bit product.\n- c1, c2, c3: These 1-bit wires are the carry out signals from the three 'rca32b' ripple carry adder instances. They are used to handle carry bits which are crucial for the correct sum of the larger bit-width operations in the module.\n- s1, ca1: These represent the sum and carry out, respectively, of the 'half_adder' instance.
