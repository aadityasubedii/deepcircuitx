The module divides the multiplication process into parts by using four instances of a smaller multiplier 'vdcmul_16b' to handle 16-bit pieces of the inputs. The partial products from these instances are then combined and adjusted using the Ripple Carry Adders (rca32b) and a half adder to correctly compute the final full 64-bit product. The use of smaller multipliers and subsequent aggregation simplifies handling of the large bit-width operations, modularizes the design for possibly easier maintenance, and might improve performance concerning hardware layout and timing."
