Module-level comment: The 'vdcmul_32b' module performs 32-bit integer multiplication, producing a 64-bit result. It decomposes the operation using four 'vdcmul_16b' instances for smaller sectional products, combines them through Ripple Carry Adders ('rca32b') and a half adder to handle overflows and alignments, thus efficiently achieving accurate 64-bit multiplication for large integers.
