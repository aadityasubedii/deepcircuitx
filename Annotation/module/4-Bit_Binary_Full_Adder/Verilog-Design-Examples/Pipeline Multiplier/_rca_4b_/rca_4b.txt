Module-level comment: The `rca_4b` module implements a 4-bit ripple carry adder using four `rca_1b` submodules, each responsible for 1-bit addition. Inputs include two 4-bit numbers `a`, `b` and a carry-in `cin`, producing a 4-bit sum `sum` and a carry-out `cout`. Inter-bit carry propagation is managed through internal wires `c[2:0]`, connecting the carry outputs of one stage to the inputs of the next, demonstrating sequential addition from the least to the most significant bit.
