Module name: rca_4b and rca_1b. Module specification: The modules `rca_4b` and `rca_1b` are designed for binary addition in digital circuits. `rca_4b` is a 4-bit ripple carry adder that takes two 4-bit binary numbers as input (`a`, `b`) along with a carry-in (`cin`) and outputs a 4-bit sum (`sum`) and a carry-out (`cout`). It uses four instances of the `rca_1b` module, which is a 1-bit full adder that handles the addition of individual bits from inputs `a` and `b`, including the carry-in, to produce a sum and a carry-out for each bit. The `rca_4b` module includes internal signals `c[2:0]` which represent carry-out bits for each 1-bit addition performed by instances of `rca_1b`. These carry-outs are cascaded as carry-ins to subsequent bits' additions within the module. Specifically, `rca_1b` instances are named `r1`, `r2`, `r3`, and `r4`, each performing sequential operations starting from the least significant to the most significant bit, thereby propagating carries and producing final outputs. The structural organization and interconnection of these module instances encapsulate the ripple carry mechanism, effectively adding together multi-bit binary numbers with dependencies between bits handled sequentially.
