The `rca_4b` module represents a 4-bit ripple carry adder, which is used to add two 4-bit binary numbers. It takes as input two 4-bit numbers `a` and `b`, and a carry-in bit `cin`, and outputs a 4-bit sum `sum` and a carry-out `cout`. The ripple carry adder utilizes four instances of the `rca_1b` submodule. Each `rca_1b` submodule is a 1-bit full adder that computes the sum and carry-out for each bit. The modules perform binary addition with carry propagation from the least significant to the most significant bit position, essential in arithmetic operations in digital circuits."

The `cin` (carry-in) input port represents the initial carry-in value for the addition, typically used in multi-stage additions where the carry output of the previous stage is fed to the next stage as carry-in.\n\nOutput ports: [sum, cout].\nExplanation: The `sum` is a 4-bit wide output port representing the result of the addition of input ports `a` and `b` along with the carry-in `cin`.

The `cin` is a 1-bit value representing the carry-in from the previous less significant bit addition.\n\nOutput ports: [sum, cout].\nExplanation: The `sum` is a 1-bit output port representing the result of the addition of 1-bit input ports `a`, `b`, and `cin`.
