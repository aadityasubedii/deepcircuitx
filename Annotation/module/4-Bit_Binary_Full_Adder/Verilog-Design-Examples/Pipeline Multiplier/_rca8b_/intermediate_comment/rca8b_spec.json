    "spec": "Module name: rca8b. \nModule specification: The \"rca8b\" module is an 8-bit ripple carry adder designed in Verilog, which computes the sum of two 8-bit input numbers 'a' and 'b', and considers an input carry 'cin'. It outputs an 8-bit sum 'sum' and a carry out 'cout'. Specifically, the input ports include: 'a' and 'b', which are 8-bit signals representing the numbers to be added; 'cin', a single-bit input representing the initial carry. The output ports are 'sum', an 8-bit signal that holds the resultant sum, and 'cout', a single-bit output indicating carry overflow. Internally, the module utilizes a wire 'cin4' which acts as a carry linking signal between two 4-bit ripple carry adder submodules, 'rc41' and 'rc42'. The submodule 'rc41' processes the lower 4 bits of 'a' and 'b', together with 'cin', to produce a partial sum and a carry-out 'cin4'. This carry-out 'cin4' is then used as the input carry for 'rc42', which processes the upper 4 bits of 'a' and 'b', ultimately yielding the upper part of the sum and the final carry out 'cout'. This hierarchical and modular design effectively breaks down the 8-bit addition into manageable parts, ensuring precise and efficient computation.",
