    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"rca8b\" module implements an 8-bit ripple carry adder, adding two 8-bit numbers 'a' and 'b' with an input carry 'cin' to produce a sum 'sum' and carry out 'cout'. It utilizes two 4-bit ripple carry adder submodules, 'rc41' and 'rc42', to process the lower and upper 4 bits of inputs, respectively, with an internal carry 'cin4' linking them for efficient carry propagation and accurate sum computation."
