It outputs a 32-bit sum `sum` and a carry out `cout`. Internally, it utilizes two instances of a 16-bit ripple carry adder module `rca16b`. The first 16-bit adder adds the lower 16 bits of `a` and `b` and passes the carry out to the second 16-bit adder, which adds the upper 16 bits of `a` and `b` along with the carry from the first adder. This modular approach helps in managing the complexity by dividing the 32-bit operation into two 16-bit operations."

It is the result of the 32-bit addition.\n- `cout` is the carry-out bit from the most significant bit of the addition.
