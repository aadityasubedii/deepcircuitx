Module-level comment: The rca32b module is a 32-bit ripple carry adder that sums two 32-bit inputs `a` and `b` with an input carry `cin`, producing a 32-bit sum `sum` and a carry out `cout`. It utilizes two instances of a 16-bit adder (rca16b), handling lower and upper halves of inputs, with an internal carry link `cin4` ensuring correct carry propagation across the 32-bit width.
