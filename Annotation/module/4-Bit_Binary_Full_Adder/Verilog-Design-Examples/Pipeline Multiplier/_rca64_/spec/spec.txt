Module name: rca64. Module specification: The "rca64" module is a 64-bit Ripple Carry Adder that performs addition of two 64-bit numbers, "a" and "b", considering an optional carry-in bit "cin". The module outputs the 64-bit sum "sum" and a carry-out "cout" signaling overflow. The inputs to the module include two 64-bit vectors "a" and "b", and a single bit "cin". The outputs comprise a 64-bit sum vector "sum" and a single bit "cout". Internally, the module utilizes a signal "cin4", which is essential for carrying out the intermediate carry between two instances of "rca32b" sub-modules. The first "rca32b" instance (rc321) adds the lower 32 bits of "a" and "b", using "cin" as its carry-in and providing "cin4" as its carry-out. The second "rca32b" instance (rc322) adds the upper 32 bits, taking "cin4" as its carry-in and producing the final "cout". This design ensures accurate carry propagation from the lower to the upper half of the adder. The division of the 64-bit adder into two 32-bit adders and their interconnection is a critical architectural choice enabling effective 64-bit addition.
