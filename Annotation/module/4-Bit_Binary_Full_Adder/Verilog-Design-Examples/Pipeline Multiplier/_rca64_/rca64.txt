Module-level comment: The "rca64" is a 64-bit Ripple Carry Adder module in Verilog that computes the sum of two 64-bit numbers with provision for a carry-in. Utilizing two "rca32b" sub-modules for its lower and upper halves, it ensures correct carry propagation (via internal signal "cin4") for seamless addition. The lower sub-module handles the least significant 32-bits, while the upper sub-module adds the most significant 32-bits, producing the overall sum and carry-out.
