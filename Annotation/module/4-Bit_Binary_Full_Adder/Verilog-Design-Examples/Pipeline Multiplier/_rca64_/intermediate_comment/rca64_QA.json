It outputs a 64-bit sum \"sum\" and a carry output \"cout\". The module internally uses two instances of the \"rca32b\" module, each responsible for adding 32 bits of the inputs. The first instance adds the lower 32 bits and generates an intermediate carry (cin4), which is then used as the carry input for the second instance that adds the upper 32 bits, finally producing the overall carry output."

The \"cout\" is a single-bit output that represents the carry-out bit of the most significant bit addition, indicating if there was an overflow beyond the 64 bits.
