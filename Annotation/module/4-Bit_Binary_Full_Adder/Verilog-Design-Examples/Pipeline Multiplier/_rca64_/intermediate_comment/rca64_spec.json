    "spec": "Module name: rca64. Module specification: The \"rca64\" module is a 64-bit Ripple Carry Adder that performs addition of two 64-bit numbers, \"a\" and \"b\", considering an optional carry-in bit \"cin\". The module outputs the 64-bit sum \"sum\" and a carry-out \"cout\" signaling overflow. The inputs to the module include two 64-bit vectors \"a\" and \"b\", and a single bit \"cin\". The outputs comprise a 64-bit sum vector \"sum\" and a single bit \"cout\". Internally, the module utilizes a signal \"cin4\", which is essential for carrying out the intermediate carry between two instances of \"rca32b\" sub-modules. The first \"rca32b\" instance (rc321) adds the lower 32 bits of \"a\" and \"b\", using \"cin\" as its carry-in and providing \"cin4\" as its carry-out. The second \"rca32b\" instance (rc322) adds the upper 32 bits, taking \"cin4\" as its carry-in and producing the final \"cout\". This design ensures accurate carry propagation from the lower to the upper half of the adder. The division of the 64-bit adder into two 32-bit adders and their interconnection is a critical architectural choice enabling effective 64-bit addition.",
