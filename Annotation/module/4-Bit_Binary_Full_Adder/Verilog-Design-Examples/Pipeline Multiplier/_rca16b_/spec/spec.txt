Module name: rca16b. 
Module specification: The rca16b module is a Verilog-based hardware component designed to compute the 16-bit addition of two binary vectors, 'a' and 'b', while also handling a carry-in (cin) and providing a carry-out (cout). This module employs two instances of an 8-bit ripple carry adder (rca8b) denoted as rc81 and rc82, to separately add the lower and upper 8 bits of the inputs. Specifically, the inputs of the rca16b module include two 16-bit vectors 'a' and 'b', intended for the binary numbers to be added, and a single-bit input 'cin', serving as the initial carry-in for the addition. The outputs of the module are a 16-bit vector 'sum' representing the combined sum of 'a' and 'b', and a single-bit 'cout' which is the final carry-out of the addition. Internally, the module uses a single-bit wire signal 'cin4' to connect the carry-out of the lower byte adder rc81 to the carry-in of the upper byte adder rc82, facilitating proper carry propagation across the two halves of the 16-bit operation. The rca16b leverages a "divide and conquer" method by breaking down the 16-bit addition into two cascaded 8-bit additions, thereby modularizing the design and improving both readability and maintainability of the code.
