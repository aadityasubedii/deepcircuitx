    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'rca16b' module is a 16-bit ripple carry adder which adds two 16-bit binary numbers 'a' and 'b', with an input carry 'cin'. It implements the addition using two 8-bit adders (rca8b): the first adder calculates the lower 8 bits and passes the carry to the second, which adds the upper 8 bits, producing the full 16-bit sum and the final carry-out."
