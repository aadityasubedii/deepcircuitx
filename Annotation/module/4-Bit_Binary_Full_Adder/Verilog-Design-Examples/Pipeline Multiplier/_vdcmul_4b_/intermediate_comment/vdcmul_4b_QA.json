Inside the module, four instances of a 2-bit multiplier (vdcmul_2b) are used to generate partial products (pp1, pp2, pp3, pp4). Additionally, two 4-bit ripple carry adders (rca_4b) and a half adder are used to sum these partial products appropriately to compute the final product. The partial products pp1 consist of the least significant bits (LSBs) of 'x' and 'y', while pp4 consists of the most significant bits (MSBs) of 'x' and 'y'. The RCA adders and the half adder help in adding the carries that result from the addition of partial products. The final product 'prod' is then constructed by concatenating the sum from the third RCA adder, the upper bits of the sum from the second RCA, and the lower two bits of pp1."
