    "module": "Module-level comment: The vdcmul_4b module multiplies two 4-bit binary numbers to produce an 8-bit product. It implements four 2-bit multipliers for partial products, two 4-bit ripple carry adders, and a half adder to calculate and sum these products, yielding the final multiplication result through a combination of these intermediary values."
