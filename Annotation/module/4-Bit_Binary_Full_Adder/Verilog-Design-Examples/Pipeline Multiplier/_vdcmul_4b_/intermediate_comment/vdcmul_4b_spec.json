    "spec": "Module name: vdcmul_4b.\nModule specification: The vdcmul_4b module is adeptly crafted to execute 4-bit multiplication, receiving two 4-bit binary numbers, 'x' and 'y', as inputs and delivering an 8-bit product, 'prod', as its output. This intricate operation is facilitated through a series of well-coordinated internal components and signal pathways. Specifically, the module utilizes inputs: 'x' and 'y', where both are 4-bit binary values acting as the multiplicand and multiplier, respectively. The sole output, 'prod', emerges as an 8-bit binary number, representing the multiplication product of 'x' and 'y'. Internally, the module cleverly leverages four instances of a 2-bit multiplier (vdcmul_2b), designated as v1 to v4, to generate intermediate partial products, namely pp1, pp2, pp3, and pp4, each spanning 4 bits. These partial products are then meticulously combined and summed using two 4-bit ripple carry adders (rca_4b), identified as r1 and r2, alongside a strategically placed half adder (half_adder h1). The interplay amongst these elements is further accentuated by a series of internal signals including pp1 to pp4, for partial products; c1 to c3, representing carry outputs from the adders; s1 and ca1, denoting sum and carry from the half adder; and sum1 to sum3, encapsulating sum outputs from the ripple carry adders. These signals serve pivotal roles in ensuring the accurate calculation and assembly of the final product 'prod' through a thoughtful arrangement of partial sums and products. The Verilog code, through its structured inclusion of the `vdcmul_2b` and `rca_4b` modules, alongside the bespoke `half_adder` module within its body, seamlessly orchestrates the complex multiplication task by first generating and then summing partial products in a methodical manner. This elaborate procedure culminates in the assignment of the 'prod' output, effectively showcasing the module's capability to tackle 4-bit multiplication with precision and efficiency.",

Inside the module, four instances of a 2-bit multiplier (vdcmul_2b) are used to generate partial products (pp1, pp2, pp3, pp4).
