    "spec": "Module name: vdcmul_64b.\nModule specification: The `vdcmul_64b` module is a Verilog implementation of a 64-bit multiplier. Its primary function is to take two 64-bit input vectors, `x` and `y`, and produce a 128-bit product vector, `prod`. The inputs are divided into smaller sections, processed by multiple instances of a 32-bit vertical-division column multiplier named `vdcmul_32b`, and then combined through a series of additions to generate the final output. The module utilizes internal signals such as `pp1`, `pp2`, `pp3`, `pp4` for holding the partial products of corresponding 32-bit sections of the input operands, computed by four instances of `vdcmul_32b`. To handle the intermediate additions, `rca64` ripple carry adders are instantiated resulting in partial sums `sum1`, `sum2`, and `sum3`, while signals `c1`, `c2`, `c3` carry the carry-out bits from each adder, and `s1` and `ca1` are outputs from a `half_adder` used to combine the carry-outs. Lastly, the `assign` statement constructs the 128-bit final product `prod` by concatenating the necessary parts of the partial sums and the partial product. This modular design encapsulates the complex multiplication operation in stages, thereby ensuring clear separation of concerns and simplifying the verification process.",

It takes two 64-bit vectors, `x` and `y`, as input operands and produces a 128-bit product vector `prod`. The module internally instantiates four 32-bit vertical-division column multipliers 'vdcmul_32b' to multiply different halves of the input operands and generate partial products `pp1`, `pp2`, `pp3`, and `pp4`. It then uses three 64-bit ripple carry adders 'rca64' to add pairs of partial products and a half adder to sum the carry out from the second and third adders. The final product is constructed by concatenating the output of the last adder (`sum3`), the upper bits of `sum2` excluding its contribution in another adder (`sum2[31:0]`), and the lower 32 bits of the first partial product (`pp1[31:0]`)."
