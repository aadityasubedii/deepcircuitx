    "module": "Module-level comment: The `vdcmul_64b` module performs 64-bit multiplication, outputting a 128-bit product. It uses four `vdcmul_32b` instances for partial products (`pp1`-`pp4`), three `rca64` adders to compute intermediate sums (`sum1`-`sum3`), and a half adder for carry handling, culminating in the final product assembly via concatenation of the sums and partial product bits."
