Module name: vdcmul_64b.
Module specification: The `vdcmul_64b` module is a Verilog implementation of a 64-bit multiplier. Its primary function is to take two 64-bit input vectors, `x` and `y`, and produce a 128-bit product vector, `prod`. The inputs are divided into smaller sections, processed by multiple instances of a 32-bit vertical-division column multiplier named `vdcmul_32b`, and then combined through a series of additions to generate the final output. The module utilizes internal signals such as `pp1`, `pp2`, `pp3`, `pp4` for holding the partial products of corresponding 32-bit sections of the input operands, computed by four instances of `vdcmul_32b`. To handle the intermediate additions, `rca64` ripple carry adders are instantiated resulting in partial sums `sum1`, `sum2`, and `sum3`, while signals `c1`, `c2`, `c3` carry the carry-out bits from each adder, and `s1` and `ca1` are outputs from a `half_adder` used to combine the carry-outs. Lastly, the `assign` statement constructs the 128-bit final product `prod` by concatenating the necessary parts of the partial sums and the partial product. This modular design encapsulates the complex multiplication operation in stages, thereby ensuring clear separation of concerns and simplifying the verification process.
