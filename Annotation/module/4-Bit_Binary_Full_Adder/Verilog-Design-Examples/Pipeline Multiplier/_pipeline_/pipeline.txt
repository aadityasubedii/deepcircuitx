Module-level comment: The "pipeline" module performs a 64-bit multiplication of inputs "x" and "y" using a pipelined architecture, producing a 128-bit output "prod". It utilizes four 32-bit multipliers for partial products, three 64-bit ripple carry adders for summing, and a half_adder for carry manipulation, operating within synchronized clocked processes to ensure accurate, sequenced execution across pipeline stages.
