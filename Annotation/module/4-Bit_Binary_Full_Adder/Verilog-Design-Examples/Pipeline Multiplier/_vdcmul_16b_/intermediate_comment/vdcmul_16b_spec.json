    "spec": "Module name: vdcmul_16b. Module specification: The `vdcmul_16b` is a Verilog module designed to perform 16-bit multiplication based on the vertical and crosswise multiplication method. The module takes two 16-bit inputs, `[15:0] x` and `[15:0] y`, which are the numbers to be multiplied. The result is given by a 32-bit output `[31:0] prod`. Internally, the module uses four instances of 8-bit multipliers (`vdcmul_8b`) to compute partial products (`pp1`, `pp2`, `pp3`, `pp4`) of different segments of `x` and `y`. These partial products are then successively added using three 16-bit ripple carry adders (`rca16b`) and a half adder to compute intermediate sums (`sum1`, `sum2`, `sum3`) and handle carries (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `ca1`, `s1`). The outputs of the adders, along with the partial products, are explicitly aligned and combined to produce the final product `prod`. The operations within the module are carefully orchestrated, leveraging smaller building blocks of adders and multipliers to efficiently produce the final output, which accurately represents the product of the two 16-bit inputs.",

Each `pp` signal represents a different segment of the overall product:\n   - `pp1` holds the product of the lower 8 bits of `x` and `y`.\n   - `pp2` holds the product of the lower 8 bits of `x` and the upper 8 bits of `y`.\n   - `pp3` holds the product of the upper 8 bits of `x` and the lower 8 bits of `y`.\n   - `pp4` holds the product of the upper 8 bits of `x` and `y`.\n\n2. `c1, c2, c3`: These are the carry-out bits from the ripple carry adders (`rca16b`). They are intermediate signals to propagate carries resulting from the addition of partial products.\n   - `c1` is the carry-out from the first 16-bit adder addition (`r161`).\n   - `c2` is the carry-out from the second 16-bit adder addition (`r162`).\n   - `c3` is the carry-out from the third 16-bit adder addition (`r163`).\n\n3. `s1, ca1`: These are the sum and carry signals from a half-adder (`half_adder`), which is used to combine the carry-out bits from the first and second adders (`c1` and `c2`).\n\n4. `sum1, sum2, sum3`: These are 16-bit signals that hold the intermediate sums computed by the adders. They form the middle bits of the final `prod` output after all additions:\n   - `sum1` is the result of the addition between `pp2` and `pp3`.\n   - `sum2` is the result of adding `sum1` with the upper 8 bits of `pp1` (aligned with a 8-bit zero padding).\n   - `sum3` is the result of the last addition between `pp4` and the concatenated result of `ca1`, `s1`, and the upper 8 bits of `sum2` (also with zero padding to align the addition)."
