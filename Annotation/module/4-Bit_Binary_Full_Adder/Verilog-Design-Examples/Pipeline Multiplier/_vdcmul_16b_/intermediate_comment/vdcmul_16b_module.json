    "module": "Module-level comment: The `vdcmul_16b` module performs a 16-bit multiplication through a series of 8-bit multiplications and additions. It accepts two 16-bit inputs `x` and `y`, and outputs their 32-bit product `prod`. Internally, the module generates partial products using `vdcmul_8b` units, sums them with 16-bit ripple carry adders (`rca16b`) and a half adder to handle carries, aligns intermediate results, and assembles the final product."
