Module name: vdcmul_16b. Module specification: The `vdcmul_16b` is a Verilog module designed to perform 16-bit multiplication based on the vertical and crosswise multiplication method. The module takes two 16-bit inputs, `[15:0] x` and `[15:0] y`, which are the numbers to be multiplied. The result is given by a 32-bit output `[31:0] prod`. Internally, the module uses four instances of 8-bit multipliers (`vdcmul_8b`) to compute partial products (`pp1`, `pp2`, `pp3`, `pp4`) of different segments of `x` and `y`. These partial products are then successively added using three 16-bit ripple carry adders (`rca16b`) and a half adder to compute intermediate sums (`sum1`, `sum2`, `sum3`) and handle carries (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `ca1`, `s1`). The outputs of the adders, along with the partial products, are explicitly aligned and combined to produce the final product `prod`. The operations within the module are carefully orchestrated, leveraging smaller building blocks of adders and multipliers to efficiently produce the final output, which accurately represents the product of the two 16-bit inputs.
