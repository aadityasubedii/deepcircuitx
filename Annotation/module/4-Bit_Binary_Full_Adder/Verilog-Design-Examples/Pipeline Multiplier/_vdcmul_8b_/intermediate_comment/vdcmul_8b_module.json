    "module": "Module-level comment: The vdcmul_8b is a Verilog module that performs 8-bit multiplication, outputting a 16-bit result. It utilizes four digit-serial 4-bit multipliers (vdcmul_4b) to generate partial products, which are summed by three 8-bit ripple carry adders (rca8b) and a half adder, to construct the final product. The multiplication is implemented in a digit-serial approach, allowing for efficient sequential processing of partial products and carries in a step-wise manner."
