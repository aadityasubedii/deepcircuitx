Module-level comment: The 'vdcmul_2b' module performs a 2-bit binary multiplication of inputs 'x' and 'y', outputting a 4-bit product 'prod'. It uses intermediate signals 's' for partial sums and 'c' for carries, computing the product through bitwise AND operations and half-adder logic across several assignment statements within the module, ultimately concatenating these results to form the final product.
