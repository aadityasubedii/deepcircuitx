It operates based on the `control` signal, which determines the type of shifting operation: holding the current value (`hold`), shifting left (`shift_left`), shifting right (`shift_right`), or loading a serial input without shifting (`siso`). The operation is triggered on the positive edge of a clock (`clk`) or the negative edge of a reset (`reset`) signal. When reset is active, the output (`data_out`) is cleared to 0. Otherwise, the output is updated based on the selected operation."

It accepts the binary data that is to be shifted or held based on the operation specified by the `control` signal.\n- `clk` (1 bit): The clock input port. It is used to synchronize the shifting operations. The shift or load action is triggered on the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- `reset` (1 bit): The reset input port. It is used to asynchronously clear the output data to 0 when active (i.e., when `reset` is low).\n- `control` ([1:0]): A 2-bit control signal input that determines the operation to be performed on `data_in`. It selects between holding the current data, shifting left, shifting right, or loading the input `data_in` directly to `data_out` without shifting (siso).\n\nOutput ports: `data_out`.\nExplanation: \n- `data_out` ([n-1:0]): This is an n-bit wide output data port.

During each clock cycle (on the positive edge of `clk`), or when the `reset` is active low, `data_out` gets updated.
