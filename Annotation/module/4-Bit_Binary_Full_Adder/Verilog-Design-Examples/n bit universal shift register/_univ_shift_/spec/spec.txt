Module name: univ_shift. Module specification: The `univ_shift` module is a universal shift register designed to operate on n-bit data input (`data_in`) using various operations controlled by a 2-bit `control` signal. The module employs input ports such as n-bit wide `data_in` for binary data to be manipulated, a clock signal `clk` to synchronize data processing, a reset `reset` for clearing the output asynchronously, and a `control` to dictate the operation mode (hold, shift left, shift right, siso). The output of the module is the n-bit `data_out` which presents the result of the operation specified by `control`. Internally, `data_out` serves as a register holding the state of the output which can clear, retain its value, shift, or load new input based on the control logic. The primary block of code, the always block, triggers on the positive edge of `clk` or the negative edge of `reset`. Within this block, operations are conditioned on the reset status and a case statement handles the various shifting and loading behaviors dictated by `control`. This architecture facilitates versatile data processing within digital designs requiring variable bit manipulation based on runtime conditions.
