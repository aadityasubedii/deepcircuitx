Module-level comment: The `univ_shift` module serves as a universal shift register for n-bit inputs, which performs bit-wise shifting or holds data based on a control signal. Implemented with a synchronous always block triggered on the clock's rising edge, it handles shift and load operations, or clears the output on reset. The case statement within the always block interprets the control signal to update the internal data_out register accordingly.
