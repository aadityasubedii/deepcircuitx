Module name: univ_shift_tb. 
Module specification: The `univ_shift_tb` is a Verilog testbench module designed to validate the functionality of a universal shift register instantiated from the `univ_shift` module. This testbench module manages the input and output signals, including `data_in` for feeding data to the shift register, `clk` as the clock signal to synchronize operations, `reset` for initializing the system, and `control` to select between different operations no shift, right shift, left shift, and load). The primary output `data_out` displays the result of the shift operation. Internally, the `new_out` signal holds expected outcomes for comparative verification of the shift register's functionality. The module features several initial blocks to generate clock signals, set an initial state, and conclude simulation. The always block, triggered on positive clock edges or negative reset edges, uses control logic to update or verify `new_out` based on various control decisions and compares it to `data_out`. Successfully matched values indicate passed tests, with results output via display tasks. A stimulus task is used to randomize control settings, facilitating comprehensive testing.
