Module-level comment: The `univ_shift_tb` module serves as a testbench for verifying a 4-bit universal shift register (`univ_shift`). It generates a clock, applies input stimuli (`data_in`, `control`), and simulates reset conditions. Test verification is conducted by comparing expected values (`new_out`) with the shift register's output (`data_out`) across different operations. Stimuli are randomized within an `always` block for diverse testing scenarios, and results are displayed post-comparison, indicating test pass or fail status.
