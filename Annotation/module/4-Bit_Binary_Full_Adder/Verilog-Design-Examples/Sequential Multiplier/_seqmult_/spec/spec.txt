Module name: seqmult. Module specification: The "seqmult" module is designed to perform bit-sequential multiplication of two 8-bit unsigned integers. It employs a synchronous design, controlled by a clock signal (`clk`), and supports asynchronous reset through a `reset` signal. The multiplication process begins when the `load` signal is asserted. The module uses two 8-bit input ports, `in_a` and `in_b`, for the operands. The output of the module consists of a 16-bit product (`out_prod`) and a 1-bit validity flag (`out_valid`) to indicate the completion of the multiplication. Internally, the module utilizes a wire (`temp_prod`) to hold a 16-bit zero-padded version of `in_b` and eight 16-bit registers (`p1` to `p8`) to store partial products based on the bit value of `in_a`. Upon loading, if a bit in `in_a` is high, `temp_prod` shifted accordingly is stored in the respective `p` register; otherwise, the register is cleared. The sum of these partial products is then calculated to produce the final output stored in `out_prod`, and `out_valid` is set to high to signify that the result is ready. The code is structured into input/output declarations, internal signal declarations, and an always block handling the synchronous and asynchronous operations including resetting, loading, computation of shifted partial products, accumulation, and signaling output validity. This structured approach efficiently encapsulates the functionality for bit-sequential multiplication, demonstrating a clear example of digital design principles applied in Verilog.
