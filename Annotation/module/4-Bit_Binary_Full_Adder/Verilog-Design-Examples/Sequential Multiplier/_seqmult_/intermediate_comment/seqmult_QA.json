On loading (`load` signal), it calculates partial products by conditionally shifting and zero-padding the second input (`in_b`) based on the bit value of the first input (`in_a`). These partial products are shifted correspondingly to their bit positions in `in_a` if the corresponding bit is high. Accumulation of these partial products is then set to the output `out_prod`. The output `out_valid` is set high once the computation is completed, indicating that `out_prod` holds a valid output. The process is controlled by a clock signal (`clk`) and can be asynchronously reset through the `reset` signal, which clears the output and validity flag."

The module examines each bit of `in_a` to determine the shifting and addition of `in_b` for the bit-sequential multiplication.\n- `in_b` (8-bit): The second operand for the multiplication. It is conditionally shifted and zero-padded based on the bit pattern of `in_a`.\n- `clk` (1-bit): The clock signal. Operations within the module are synchronized to the rising edge of this clock.\n- `load` (1-bit): A control signal that initiates the multiplication process. When high, the module starts processing the inputs `in_a` and `in_b`.\n- `reset` (1-bit): An asynchronous reset signal. When high, it clears the output product and the validity flag, regardless of the clock signal.\n\nOutput ports: `out_valid`, `out_prod`.\nExplanation:\n- `out_valid` (1-bit): A flag that indicates the completion of the multiplication operation. It is set high once the final product is available in `out_prod`.\n- `out_prod` (16-bit): The output port where the product of the two input operands (`in_a` and `in_b`) is stored after the computation is completed."
