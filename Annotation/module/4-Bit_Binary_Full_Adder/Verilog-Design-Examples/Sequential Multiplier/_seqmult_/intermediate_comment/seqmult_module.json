    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"seqmult\" module performs bit-sequential multiplication of two 8-bit operands (`in_a`, `in_b`). It starts processing when `load` is high, utilizing a network of internal registers (`p1` to `p8`) to store conditional partial products, shifted based on `in_a` bits. These are accumulated to produce a 16-bit product (`out_prod`) with validity (`out_valid`), controlled by a clock (`clk`) and supporting asynchronous reset (`reset`)."
