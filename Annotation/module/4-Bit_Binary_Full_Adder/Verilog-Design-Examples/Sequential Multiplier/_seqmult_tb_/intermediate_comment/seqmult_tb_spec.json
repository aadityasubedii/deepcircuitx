    "spec": "Module name: seqmult_tb. \nModule specification: The 'seqmult_tb' serves as a testbench dedicated to verifying the operations of a sequential multiplier implemented in an associated 'seqmult' module. This testbench facilitates simulations by driving test vectors, specifically the 8-bit inputs 'in_a' and 'in_b', into the 'seqmult' module, and subsequently checking the 16-bit output 'out_prod' against an internally calculated reference 'new_out'. The inputs include 'in_a' and 'in_b' as the operands for multiplication, a 'clk' signal for synchronization, a 'load' control to initiate a new multiplication operation, and a 'reset' to initialize or clear internal states. The outputs monitored are 'out_valid', indicating the availability of a valid multiplication result, and 'out_prod', which is the product from the 'seqmult' module. Internal signals such as 'new_out', a 16-bit register, hold the internally expected product calculated directly by multiplying 'in_a' and 'in_b', and 'new_valid', a flag indicating the validity of 'new_out'. The code structure includes initialization blocks to set the clock and reset the conditions, a block for generating random stimulus for inputs, and sequential logic controlled by the clock and reset signals to update 'new_out' and 'new_valid'. The testbench checks if the 'out_prod' matches 'new_out' and declares the test case as passed or failed accordingly.",
