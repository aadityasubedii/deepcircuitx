Module-level comment: The 'seqmult_tb' module is a testbench for the 'seqmult' sequential multiplier, automatically generating random test operands ('in_a' and 'in_b'), managing simulation timing with clock ('clk') and control signals ('reset' and 'load'), and comparing the DUT's product output ('out_prod') with the internally calculated expected result ('new_out'). It uses initial blocks for simulation control and an always block for result validation, reporting test pass or failure based on output verification.
