Module-level comment: The 'dff_async' module implements an asynchronous D flip-flop with active-high reset using Verilog. It captures the input 'i_d' at the clock 'clk' rising edge, resets the output 'o_q' when 'reset' is high, and continuously provides an inverted output 'o_qb'. Internal flip-flop behavior is managed by an 'always' block and combinational logic for inversion.
