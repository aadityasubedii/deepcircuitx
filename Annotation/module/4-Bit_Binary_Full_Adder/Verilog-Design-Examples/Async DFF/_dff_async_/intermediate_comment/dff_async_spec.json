    "spec": "Module name: dff_async\nModule specification: The dff_async module is a Verilog-based digital design that implements an asynchronous D flip-flop with an active-high reset. Its role is to sample the data input 'i_d' at every rising edge of the clock 'clk' and update the output 'o_q' accordingly unless the 'reset' signal is high, in which case 'o_q' is set to 0. The flip-flop features two inputs: 'i_d', the binary data to be stored; 'clk', the clock signal that drives the state changes; and 'reset', which is used to asynchronously clear the flip-flop's state. It also includes two outputs: 'o_q', which represents the current state of the flip-flop and retains the value of 'i_d' after the clock's rising edge, and 'o_qb', which is the logical complement of 'o_q'. Internally, 'o_q' functions as a register to hold the flip-flop's value, and 'o_qb' is derived from 'o_q' through combinational logic. The Verilog code consists of an 'always' block that describes the behavior of the flip-flop, evaluating the reset condition and updating 'o_q' according to the input 'i_d', and an 'assign' statement to set 'o_qb' to the inverse of 'o_q', maintaining the relationship between the outputs. This arrangement ensures that the module can serve a reliable storage and inversion role in digital circuits.",

The rising edge of 'clk' is specifically used to determine when 'i_d' should be read and possibly alter the state of 'o_q'.\n- 'reset' is the asynchronous reset input, which when high (active-high), forces the output 'o_q' to 0 regardless of the current clock signal or data input states.\n\nOutput ports: o_q, o_qb.\nExplanation:\n- 'o_q' is the primary output of the flip-flop. It stores or reflects the value of 'i_d' that was present at the last rising edge of 'clk', especially when 'reset' is not active. If 'reset' is active, 'o_q' is forced to 0.\n- 'o_qb' is the complement or inverse of 'o_q'.
