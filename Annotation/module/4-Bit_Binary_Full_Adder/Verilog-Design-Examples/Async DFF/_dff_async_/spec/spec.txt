Module name: dff_async
Module specification: The dff_async module is a Verilog-based digital design that implements an asynchronous D flip-flop with an active-high reset. Its role is to sample the data input 'i_d' at every rising edge of the clock 'clk' and update the output 'o_q' accordingly unless the 'reset' signal is high, in which case 'o_q' is set to 0. The flip-flop features two inputs: 'i_d', the binary data to be stored; 'clk', the clock signal that drives the state changes; and 'reset', which is used to asynchronously clear the flip-flop's state. It also includes two outputs: 'o_q', which represents the current state of the flip-flop and retains the value of 'i_d' after the clock's rising edge, and 'o_qb', which is the logical complement of 'o_q'. Internally, 'o_q' functions as a register to hold the flip-flop's value, and 'o_qb' is derived from 'o_q' through combinational logic. The Verilog code consists of an 'always' block that describes the behavior of the flip-flop, evaluating the reset condition and updating 'o_q' according to the input 'i_d', and an 'assign' statement to set 'o_qb' to the inverse of 'o_q', maintaining the relationship between the outputs. This arrangement ensures that the module can serve a reliable storage and inversion role in digital circuits.
