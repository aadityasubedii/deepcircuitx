Module name: dff_async_tb. Module specification: The `dff_async_tb` is a Verilog testbench module designed to rigorously test a D-type flip-flop with asynchronous reset functionality. This testbench checks the flip-flop implemented in another module, presumably titled `dff_async`, specifically observing its performance under a variety of conditions. The module utilizes input ports - `d` for data, `clk` for the clock signal, and `reset` for the asynchronous reset. The output of the flip-flop is monitored through two ports: `q`, which holds the value of the flip-flop, and `qb`, which is the logical complement of `q`. Internally, this module uses `clk`, `d`, and `reset` as reg type signals to drive the test simulation, feeding various values to the flip-flop, while `q` and `qb` are gathered as wire type outputs from the flip-flop. The code within this module incorporates two initial blocks and one task: the first initial block controls the clock signal, toggling it every unit time to mimic a real-time environment; the second initial block repeatedly calls a stimulus task to randomize `d` and `reset` inputs, inspecting output signals `q` and `qb` after each application, then printing the result as either a "Testcase Passed" or "Testcase Failed" based on predefined conditions. The stimulus task itself is responsible for setting random values to `d` and `reset`, facilitating dynamic testing over 100 iterations.
