    "spec": "Module name: dff_async_tb. Module specification: The `dff_async_tb` is a Verilog testbench module designed to rigorously test a D-type flip-flop with asynchronous reset functionality. This testbench checks the flip-flop implemented in another module, presumably titled `dff_async`, specifically observing its performance under a variety of conditions. The module utilizes input ports - `d` for data, `clk` for the clock signal, and `reset` for the asynchronous reset. The output of the flip-flop is monitored through two ports: `q`, which holds the value of the flip-flop, and `qb`, which is the logical complement of `q`. Internally, this module uses `clk`, `d`, and `reset` as reg type signals to drive the test simulation, feeding various values to the flip-flop, while `q` and `qb` are gathered as wire type outputs from the flip-flop. The code within this module incorporates two initial blocks and one task: the first initial block controls the clock signal, toggling it every unit time to mimic a real-time environment; the second initial block repeatedly calls a stimulus task to randomize `d` and `reset` inputs, inspecting output signals `q` and `qb` after each application, then printing the result as either a \"Testcase Passed\" or \"Testcase Failed\" based on predefined conditions. The stimulus task itself is responsible for setting random values to `d` and `reset`, facilitating dynamic testing over 100 iterations.",

It tests how the flip-flop behaves under various random input conditions (`d` and `reset`). The module simulates the flip-flop's response to changes in the input signal `d` and the reset condition over a series of clock cycles. It continuously toggles the clock and applies random values to `d` and `reset`.

The clock signal is continuously toggled in the testbench to simulate the flip-flop's behavior over time.\n- `reset`: This asynchronous reset input allows the D-type flip-flop to be reset to a known state independently of the clock signal. During the simulation, this input is randomly toggled to test the flip-flop's response to asynchronous reset situations.\n\nOutput ports: q, qb.\nExplanation:\n- `q`: This is the primary output of the D-type flip-flop, which holds the value of the data input `d` after the positive edge of the clock, provided that the reset condition is not active.\n- `qb`: This is the complement of the output `q`.
