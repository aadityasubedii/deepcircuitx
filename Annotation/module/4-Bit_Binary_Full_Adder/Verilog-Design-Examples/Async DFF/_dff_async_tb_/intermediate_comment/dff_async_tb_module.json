    "module": "Module-level comment: The `dff_async_tb` module serves as a testbench for evaluating a D-type flip-flop with asynchronous reset, testing its behavior under various `d` and `reset` conditions across clock cycles. It employs internal signals for inputs (`d`, `clk`, `reset`) and monitors outputs (`q`, `qb`), executing a stimulus task within a loop to randomize input states and validate the flip-flop's response, effectively ensuring consistent operation and reliability in diverse scenarios."
