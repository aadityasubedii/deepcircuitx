Module name: mux_case. 
Module specification: The 'mux_case' module implements a 4-to-1 multiplexer that operates with 2-bit width inputs and outputs. It selectively forwards data from one of its four 2-bit input ports, namely in0, in1, in2, and in3, to a single 2-bit output port, out, based on the value supplied to the 2-bit selector input port, select. Specifically, the multiplexer maps the value of select to corresponding inputs as follows: 0 maps to in0, 1 to in1, 2 to in2, and 3 to in3. This selection is achieved using a 'case' statement within an 'always' block that is sensitive to the 'select' signal, ensuring that any changes in 'select' directly modify the output 'out'. Notably, the module does not use any internal signals aside from the direct connections formed by these ports. The Verilog code efficiently captures this functionality by employing a straightforward case decision structure within the sensitivity list of the 'select' signal, devoid of additional logic or internal storage mechanisms, making the module concise yet fully functional for its intended multiplexing task.
