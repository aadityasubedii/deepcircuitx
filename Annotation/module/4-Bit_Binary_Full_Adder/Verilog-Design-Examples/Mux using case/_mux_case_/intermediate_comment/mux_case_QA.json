It has four 2-bit input lines named in0, in1, in2, and in3, as well as a 2-bit selector line named select. Depending on the value of the select line, the multiplexer forwards the data from one of its input lines to the 2-bit output line out. When select is 0, in0 is sent to out; when select is 1, in1 is routed to out; for select equal to 2, in2 gets outputted; and when select is 3, in3 is sent to out. The selectivity is managed using a case statement that is sensitive to changes in the select signal."

The port 'select' is a 2-bit input that serves as the control signal for the multiplexer. The value of 'select' determines which of the input lines (in0-in3) is connected to the output.\n\nOutput ports: out. \nExplanation: The 'out' port is a 2-bit output that reflects the selected data from one of the input ports in0, in1, in2, or in3.
