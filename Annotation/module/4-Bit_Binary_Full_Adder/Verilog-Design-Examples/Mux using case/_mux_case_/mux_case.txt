Module-level comment: The 'mux_case' module is a 2-bit 4-to-1 multiplexer that selects one of four input signals (in0-in3) based on a 2-bit selector (select) and outputs the chosen signal on the 'out' port. It uses a case statement inside an always block, sensitive to the selector, to directly drive the output without additional internal signals.
