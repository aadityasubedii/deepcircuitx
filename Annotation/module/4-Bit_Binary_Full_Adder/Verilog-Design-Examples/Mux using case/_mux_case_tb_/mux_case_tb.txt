Module-level comment: The 'mux_case_tb' module serves as a testbench for a 4-to-1 multiplexer. It performs verification by comparing expected and actual outputs for randomly generated selections. The input ports 'in0' to 'in3' (2-bit each) are the data inputs, with a 2-bit 'select' input for input selection. The output 'out' (2-bit) reflects the current multiplexer output. The stimulus task generates random select lines, computes the expected output 'new_out', and checks against 'out' in multiple test iterations.
