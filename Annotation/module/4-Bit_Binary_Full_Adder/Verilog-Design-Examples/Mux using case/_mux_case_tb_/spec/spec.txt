Module name: mux_case_tb.

Module specification: The 'mux_case_tb' is a testbench module designed to test a 4-to-1 multiplexer, verifying its functionality by checking whether the actual output matches the expected output for multiple test cases. It consists of input ports 'in0' to 'in3', which are all 2-bit wide and serve as the data inputs to the multiplexer. The 2-bit input 'select' determines which input line is routed to the output. The single output port 'out' is a 2-bit wide wire that carries the actual output from the multiplexer. Internally, the module makes use of a 2-bit wide register 'new_out' that holds the expected output value calculated by emulating the behavior of a 4-to-1 multiplexer within a 'stimulus' task based on the 'select' input. The testbench instantiates the multiplexer to be tested ('dut') and drives it with test vectors. The main code block uses an 'initial' block to initialize input values and a 'repeat' loop to execute 100 test iterations, invoking the 'stimulus' task that randomly selects input lines, determines the expected 'new_out', and compares it to 'out'. The results are displayed, indicating whether each test is a pass or a fail. The 'stimulus' task contains the logic for selecting inputs and generating the expected outcome for verification purposes.
