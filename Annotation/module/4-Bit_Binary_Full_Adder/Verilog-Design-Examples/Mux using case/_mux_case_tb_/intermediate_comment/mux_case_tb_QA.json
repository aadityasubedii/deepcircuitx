The testbench applies various combinations of inputs to the multiplexer and checks its output against the expected result, which is stored in the register `new_out`. It uses a `stimulus` task to generate random selections and determine the expected output based on these selections. The module tests all possible select lines for the multiplexer and displays whether the output matches the expected new_out, indicating if each test case is passed or failed. This verification process is repeated 100 times according to the `repeat(100)` statement in the `initial` block."
