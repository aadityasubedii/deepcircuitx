    "module": "Module-level comment: The `mealy_ol_tb` module serves as a testbench for the `mealy_ol` Mealy state machine, verifying its sequence detection logic. It generates a clock, applies random inputs, and iteratively simulates the `reset` condition. The module's operation is checked against expected results stored in `new_out`, with state transitions driven by `ps` and `ns` internal signals. The testbench evaluates functionality by comparing actual to expected output and reporting test outcomes."
