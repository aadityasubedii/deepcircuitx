Module name: mealy_ol_tb. Module specification: The `mealy_ol_tb` module is a testbench for a Mealy state machine encapsulated within an instantiated module named `mealy_ol`. It is purpose-built to verify whether the state machine correctly identifies a particular binary sequence within a stream of random binary inputs. The module incorporates input ports like `in` for the binary data stream, `clk` as a timing reference for state transitions, and `reset` for initializing the state machine at the beginning of each test run. The single output port `out` represents the state machineâ€™s indication of having detected the specific sequence. Internal signals include `new_out` to hold the expected output for comparison, `ps` for tracking the current state, and `ns` for determining the forthcoming state. The testbench initializes and generates a clock signal and reset condition, uses a task named `stimulus` to provide random binary input, and compares the module output `out` with the expected outcome `new_out`. The main testing logic in the testbench reports pass or fail for each test case based on the match between `out` and `new_out` and additionally flags when the sequence "1101" is detected. A state transition always block dictates the behavior of the state machine in response to input changes and reset events, and a combinational always block specifies the output and next-state logic based on the current state and input.
