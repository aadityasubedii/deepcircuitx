    "spec": "Module name: mealy_ol.\n\nModule specification: The \"mealy_ol\" module describes a Mealy state machine with four distinct states (S0 to S3) and transitions between them based on the binary input signal 'in'. The machine assumes new states with the synchronization of a clock signal 'clk' and can be reset to its initial state with the 'reset' signal. Its design encompasses two input signals 'in', 'clk', and 'reset', where 'in' is responsible for influencing the state transitions, 'clk' provides synchronization for transitions, and 'reset' initializes the state to S0 when activated. The single output signal 'out' indicates the detection of a pattern, specifically when transitioning from S3 to S1 while 'in' is high, setting 'out' to 1; otherwise, 'out' is set to 0. Internally, the module uses 'present_state', a register holding the current state, and 'next_state', a register for computing the subsequent state based on 'present_state' and 'in'. The module's logic is divided into two main always blocks: the first block is sensitive to the positive edge of 'clk' and 'reset', and it updates 'present_state' accordingly; the second block is sensitive to changes in 'present_state' or 'in', and it implements the state transition logic for 'next_state' as well as the output logic for 'out' using a case statement to handle different scenarios based on the current state.",

On every positive edge of the 'clk' (clock) signal or a positive edge of the 'reset' signal, the present state can either be reset to S0 or moved to the next calculated state. The output 'out' changes according to the current state and the input 'in': it's set to 1 only when transitioning from S3 to S1 upon 'in' being high, otherwise, it remains 0. This behavior suggests the module tracks a specific sequence of input signals to generate an output, indicative of a specific pattern recognition or control mechanism within a digital system."

The state transitions occur on the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- 'reset' is a signal input used to asynchronously reset the machine to its initial state (S0) regardless of the current state when it goes high.\n\nOutput ports: out.\nExplanation:\n- 'out' is an output signal that changes its state based on the current state (S3) and the input signal 'in'. This output is primarily used to indicate when a specific sequence is detected by the state machine (transition from S3 to S1 with 'in' high sets 'out' to 1). For all other cases, it remains 0."

It is used to determine the next state and the output based on the current input 'in'. On every positive edge of the 'clk' or when a 'reset' is applied, the value of 'present_state' is updated to either the initial state (S0) or to whatever 'next_state' is calculated to be based on the current state and input.\n  \n- next_state: This is a register that is used to calculate and temporarily hold what the next state should be based on the current state (stored in 'present_state') and the current input 'in'. This calculation is done in the always block that is sensitive to 'present_state' or 'in'. 'next_state' is not directly outputted but is used to update 'present_state' on the next clock edge or reset event."
