Module-level comment: The "mealy_ol" module implements a Mealy state machine with transitions across four states (S0-S3) based on input 'in'. Utilizes 'clk' for synchronization, 'reset' for initial state, and internal registers 'present_state'/'next_state' for managing transitions. Outputs 'out' signal upon specific state transition pattern, achieved via state logic in always blocks sensitive to 'clk', 'reset', and 'in'.
