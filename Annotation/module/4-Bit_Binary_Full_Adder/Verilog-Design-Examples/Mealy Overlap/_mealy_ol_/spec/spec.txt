Module name: mealy_ol.

Module specification: The "mealy_ol" module describes a Mealy state machine with four distinct states (S0 to S3) and transitions between them based on the binary input signal 'in'. The machine assumes new states with the synchronization of a clock signal 'clk' and can be reset to its initial state with the 'reset' signal. Its design encompasses two input signals 'in', 'clk', and 'reset', where 'in' is responsible for influencing the state transitions, 'clk' provides synchronization for transitions, and 'reset' initializes the state to S0 when activated. The single output signal 'out' indicates the detection of a pattern, specifically when transitioning from S3 to S1 while 'in' is high, setting 'out' to 1; otherwise, 'out' is set to 0. Internally, the module uses 'present_state', a register holding the current state, and 'next_state', a register for computing the subsequent state based on 'present_state' and 'in'. The module's logic is divided into two main always blocks: the first block is sensitive to the positive edge of 'clk' and 'reset', and it updates 'present_state' accordingly; the second block is sensitive to changes in 'present_state' or 'in', and it implements the state transition logic for 'next_state' as well as the output logic for 'out' using a case statement to handle different scenarios based on the current state.
