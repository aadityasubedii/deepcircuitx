It utilizes various sub-modules such as `arithmeticCircuit`, `logicCircuit`, and `rightShift` for specific functionalities. The `arithmeticCircuit` calculates arithmetic results depending on the input state and data, the `logicCircuit` manages logic operations like AND, OR, and XOR, and `rightShift` performs right shifting on the data input. Furthermore, it uses multiplexers (`mux2`) to select either arithmetic results, logic results, or shifted outputs based on control signals (`s4`, `s3`, `s2`, `s1`). The output is a 5-bit vector showing the result of these combined operations determined by the given selection inputs."
