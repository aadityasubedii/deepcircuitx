    "module": "The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) module performs a combination of arithmetic and logic operations on two 4-bit input vectors 'a' and 'b', controlled by four input signals 's4', 's3', 's2', 's1'. It integrates functional sub-modules like `arithmeticCircuit`, `logicCircuit`, and `rightShift` alongside `mux2` multiplexers to select and route operations based on the control signals, producing a 5-bit output vector that reflects computations such as addition, bitwise operations, or shifts according to specified control inputs."
