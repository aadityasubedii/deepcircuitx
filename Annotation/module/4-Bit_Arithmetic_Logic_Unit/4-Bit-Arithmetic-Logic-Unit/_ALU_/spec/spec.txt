Module name: ALU. Module specification: The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) module, coded in Verilog, performs arithmetic operations and logic functions utilizing multiple sub-modules along with combination and manipulation of incoming binary data based on control signals. The inputs to the ALU include two 4-bit vectors 'a' and 'b' which serve as the primary operands. Additional control inputs are 's4', 's3', 's2', and 's1' which direct the flow and processing of data within the ALU to choose between different operations and outputs. The output from the ALU is a 5-bit vector 'o', representing the result of the operations selected by the inputs. Internally, the module employs several wires: 'ar' stores results from `arithmeticCircuit`, 'l' holds results from `logicCircuit`, 'shift' carries the output from `rightShift`, and 'temp' temporarily holds values for further selection. The code consists of instantiations of `arithmeticCircuit`, `logicCircuit`, and `rightShift` modules for conducting specific operations, accompanied by `mux2` multiplexers to guide results based on the state of control signals towards the final output. This organized and modular structure enables flexible and diverse functional capabilities for computing arithmetic and logical operations efficiently.
