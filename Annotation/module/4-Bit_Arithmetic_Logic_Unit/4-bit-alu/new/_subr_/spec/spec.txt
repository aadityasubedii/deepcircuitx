Module name: subr. Module specification: The 'subr' module is designed to perform binary subtraction with borrow handling. It takes three input ports: 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Here, 'a' and 'b' represent the two binary digits where 'a' is the minuend and 'b' the subtrahend, while 'c' serves as the incoming borrow bit from a less significant bit position. The module provides two output ports: 'diff' and 'borr'. 'diff' outputs the result of the subtraction, calculated using a bitwise XOR operation between 'a', 'b', and 'c', thus giving the difference. 'borr' indicates whether a borrow is generated out of the subtraction, signifying if a borrow should be passed to the next more significant bit. Internally, the module uses a signal 'anot', which holds the negated value of 'a' computed via a bitwise NOT operation. This negation helps in determining the necessity of a borrow by participating in several AND and OR operations to compute the 'borr' signal. The code primarily consists of assignments for the internal signal and output ports, distinctly computing the required values for subtraction and borrow propagation based on the logical design discussed.
