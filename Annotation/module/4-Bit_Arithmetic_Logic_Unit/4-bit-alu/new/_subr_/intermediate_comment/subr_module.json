    "module": "The 'subr' module performs binary subtraction with borrow handling, taking three inputs 'a', 'b', and 'c' to compute the result and indicate if a borrow is generated. It calculates the difference 'diff' using bitwise XOR operation and determines the borrow 'borr' through logical AND and OR operations involving the inputs and the negated value of 'a'."
