It takes three inputs 'a', 'b', and 'c' (where 'c' might represent an incoming borrow bit) and outputs 'diff', which represents the result of binary subtraction considering a borrow, and 'borr', which indicates if there is a borrow generated from the operation. It computes the difference using the XOR operation between a, b, and c, and calculates whether a borrow is needed in the subtraction using a combination of AND and OR gates with the inputs and their negated forms."

The port 'c' serves as the borrow in bit which is used when there has been a borrow from a previous less significant bit position.\n\nOutput ports: diff, borr. Explanation: The output port 'diff' provides the result of the subtraction operation using bitwise XOR considering all inputs, effectively representing the binary difference.
