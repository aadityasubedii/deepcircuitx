Module name: or4. Module specification: The 'or4' module is designed to perform a bitwise OR operation between two 4-bit inputs, named 'a' and 'b'. The output of this operation is a 4-bit vector 'out', where each bit of 'out' is the bitwise OR result of the corresponding bits from 'a' and 'b'. In detail, the inputs 'a' and 'b' are each 4-bit wide and provide the binary values for the operation. The output 'out' is also 4-bit wide, carrying the result of the bitwise OR across all bits from the inputs. The module does not utilize any internal signals, ensuring all operations are direct and efficient. This is implemented through four 'or' gates, each mapped correspondingly to the bits of the inputs and outputs; 'or0' for the least significant bits to 'or3' for the most significant bits. These gates are directly connected to their respective bits of 'a', 'b', and 'out', facilitating straightforward and clear logic operations within the module without the need for any intermediate signal processing. This setup makes the 'or4' module compact and functionally focused, specifically tailored for effective bitwise OR operations on 4-bit binary vectors.
