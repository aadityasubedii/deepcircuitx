The 'or4' module performs a bitwise OR operation on two 4-bit inputs, 'a' and 'b', outputting the result on a 4-bit 'out' port. It achieves this using four instantiated 'or' gates directly linking each bit of inputs 'a' and 'b' to the corresponding bit in the output 'out', ensuring immediate and efficient logical processing without internal signals.
