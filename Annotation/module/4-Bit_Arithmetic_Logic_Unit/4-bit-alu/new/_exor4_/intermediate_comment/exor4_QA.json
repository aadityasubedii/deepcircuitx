The result of this bitwise XOR operation is output in a 4-bit vector 'out'. Each bit of the output vector 'out' is the result of the XOR operation on the corresponding bits of the input vectors 'a' and 'b'. Specifically, 'out[0]' is the XOR of 'a[0]' and 'b[0]', 'out[1]' is the XOR of 'a[1]' and 'b[1]', and so forth up to 'out[3]'. This functionality is achieved using four 'xor' gates, each handling one bit of the input vectors to produce each bit of the output vector."
