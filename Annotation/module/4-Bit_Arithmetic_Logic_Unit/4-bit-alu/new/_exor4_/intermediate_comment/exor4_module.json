    "module": "The 'exor4' module performs a bitwise XOR operation on two 4-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', resulting in a 4-bit output 'out'. This functionality is implemented using four XOR gates (xor0 to xor3) that directly connect each bit of the input vectors to the corresponding bit of the output vector, thereby avoiding the use of internal signals and streamlining the computation process."
