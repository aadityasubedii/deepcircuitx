Module name: exor4. Module specification: The 'exor4' module is designed to perform a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation on two 4-bit input vectors, named 'a' and 'b'. Each bit from the input vectors 'a' and 'b' is subjected to this XOR operation via four dedicated 'xor' gates, with the results being output through a 4-bit vector 'out'. Specifically, each output bit in 'out' (from out[0] to out[3]) directly receives its value from one corresponding 'xor' gate (xor0 to xor3), where, for instance, 'xor0' processes 'a[0]' and 'b[0]' and sends the result to 'out[0]'. This efficiently maps the input bits to their corresponding output bits in a minimalistic approach. Interestingly, this design does not utilize any internal signals, and the XOR functionality is achieved by directly mapping inputs to the outputs. Additionally, the code for the module is compactly arranged with gates instantiated consecutively following the input-output declarations, making it straightforward and focused strictly on the essential operation without added complexities.
