Module specification: The 'alu' module, short for Arithmetic Logic Unit, is designed to execute a variety of arithmetic and logical operations based on two 4-bit inputs, `in1` and `in2`, governed by a 3-bit operation selector `op`. The results of these operations are output through a single 9-bit port `out`. Internally, the module employs eight signals: `a1` and `a2` are 5-bit signals holding results from addition and subtraction respectively; `a3`, `a4`, and `a5` are 4-bit signals for bitwise AND, XOR, and OR results; `a6` and `a7` hold results of left and right bit rotations; and `a8` is an 8-bit signal for multiplication results. The module integrates several sub-modules for these operations: `adder4` for addition, `subr4` for subtraction, `and4`, `exor4`, and `or4` for bitwise operations, `rol4` and `ror4` for rotations, and `multi4` for multiplication. A multiplexer `mux16` is used to select the appropriate result based on the `op` signal, routing it to the output `out`. This configuration embodies a comprehensive system capable of performing complex computational tasks integral to arithmetic and logical processing within digital systems.",
