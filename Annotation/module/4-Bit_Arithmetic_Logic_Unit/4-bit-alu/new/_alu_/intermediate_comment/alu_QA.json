It takes two 4-bit inputs (`in1` and `in2`) and a 3-bit operation selector (`op`). Depending on the value of `op`, the module performs one of several functions such as addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, XOR, OR, left rotation, right rotation, or multiplication through instantiated sub-modules (`adder4`, `subr4`, etc.). The result of the selected operation is output through a 9-bit output `out`. The selection of the output is managed by a multiplexer (`mux16`)."
