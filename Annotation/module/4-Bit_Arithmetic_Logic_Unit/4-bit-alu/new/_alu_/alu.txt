The 'alu' module performs various arithmetic and logical operations by taking two 4-bit inputs and a 3-bit operation selector, outputting a 9-bit result based on the selected operation. It incorporates sub-modules for addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, XOR, OR, left and right rotations, and multiplication, each producing intermediate results held by internal signals. A multiplexer selects the final output from these results based on the operation code provided by the selector.
