The adder4 module adds two 4-bit binary numbers, producing a 5-bit sum with the fifth bit as carry-out to handle overflow. It uses four full_adder instances, each adding corresponding bits and carrying between stages via wires c1, c2, and c3, seamlessly integrating each addition from LSB to MSB to compute the total sum accurately.
