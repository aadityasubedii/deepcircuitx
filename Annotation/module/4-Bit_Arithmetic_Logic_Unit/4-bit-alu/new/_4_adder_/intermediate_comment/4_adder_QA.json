It outputs a 5-bit sum `SUM` where the fifth bit represents the carry-out if there is an overflow from the addition of the most significant bits. This module utilizes four instances of a `full_adder` module to perform the bit-wise addition. Each `full_adder` is responsible for adding corresponding bits of `A` and `B`, along with a carry input, and outputs a sum bit and a carry bit. The carries are cascaded from the lower bit positions to the higher."

These inputs represent the two 4-bit numbers that are to be added together using the adder4 module. Each bit in A and B is added correspondingly from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) along with the propagation of carry from the lower bits.\n\nOutput ports: [SUM]. Explanation: The output port 'SUM' is a 5-bit wide binary value. It holds the result of the addition of two 4-bit numbers from the input ports A and B. The first four bits (SUM[3:0]) of this output represent the direct sum of the corresponding bits of A and B, factoring in any carry from adding the preceding lower significant bits. The fifth bit (SUM[4]) is the carry-out, which indicates an overflow, meaning there was a carry from the addition of the most significant bits. This carry-out is crucial for chaining adder modules in wider bit-width addition operations."

Explanation: The internal signals c1, c2, and c3 are wire types used to propagate carries between the consecutive stages of the full adders within the `adder4` module. Specifically, c1 is the carry-out from the addition of the least significant bits (i.e., A[0] and B[0]), which serves as the carry-in for the next stage (addition of A[1] and B[1]) executed by `full_adder` instance a2. Similarly, c2 is the carry-out from the addition at the second bit position and acts as the carry-in for adding the third bits (A[2] and B[2]) in `full_adder` a3. Lastly, c3 is the carry-out from the third position that becomes the carry-in for the final addition operation of the most significant bits (A[3] and B[3]) in `full_adder` a4. The output of this last addition operation encompasses not only the sum of these bits but also the overall carry-out of the whole addition, represented by `SUM[4]`. These internal signals are critical for ensuring that the carries generated at each bit addition are accurately fed into the subsequent addition stages, maintaining correct computation of the overall sum."
