    "spec": "Module name: adder4. Module specification: The `adder4` module is designed to perform the addition of two 4-bit binary numbers, labelled as inputs A and B. It generates a 5-bit output, SUM, where SUM[4:0] encapsulates the results of the addition, with SUM[4] serving as the carry-out bit, indicating an overflow for wider bit-width addition operations. The module employs four instances of the `full_adder` submodule to implement bit-wise addition across the four bits. The interconnections among these submodules use internal signals, c1, c2, and c3, which serve as carry propagators between the successive addition stages. Specifically, c1 forwards the carry from the addition of the least significant bits to the next stage, while c2 and c3 perform analogous roles for the middle bit additions, culminating in the carry-out summed in SUM[4]. This structured usage of full adders implements a cascaded addition, crucial for obtaining accurate results in the designated 5-bit format outcome, allowing for correct and systematic binary addition within a digital circuit design.",

It outputs a 5-bit sum `SUM` where the fifth bit represents the carry-out if there is an overflow from the addition of the most significant bits. This module utilizes four instances of a `full_adder` module to perform the bit-wise addition. Each `full_adder` is responsible for adding corresponding bits of `A` and `B`, along with a carry input, and outputs a sum bit and a carry bit. The carries are cascaded from the lower bit positions to the higher."

Each bit in A and B is added correspondingly from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) along with the propagation of carry from the lower bits.\n\nOutput ports: [SUM]. Explanation: The output port 'SUM' is a 5-bit wide binary value. It holds the result of the addition of two 4-bit numbers from the input ports A and B. The first four bits (SUM[3:0]) of this output represent the direct sum of the corresponding bits of A and B, factoring in any carry from adding the preceding lower significant bits. The fifth bit (SUM[4]) is the carry-out, which indicates an overflow, meaning there was a carry from the addition of the most significant bits. This carry-out is crucial for chaining adder modules in wider bit-width addition operations."

Explanation: The internal signals c1, c2, and c3 are wire types used to propagate carries between the consecutive stages of the full adders within the `adder4` module. Specifically, c1 is the carry-out from the addition of the least significant bits (i.e., A[0] and B[0]), which serves as the carry-in for the next stage (addition of A[1] and B[1]) executed by `full_adder` instance a2. Similarly, c2 is the carry-out from the addition at the second bit position and acts as the carry-in for adding the third bits (A[2] and B[2]) in `full_adder` a3. Lastly, c3 is the carry-out from the third position that becomes the carry-in for the final addition operation of the most significant bits (A[3] and B[3]) in `full_adder` a4. The output of this last addition operation encompasses not only the sum of these bits but also the overall carry-out of the whole addition, represented by `SUM[4]`. These internal signals are critical for ensuring that the carries generated at each bit addition are accurately fed into the subsequent addition stages, maintaining correct computation of the overall sum."
