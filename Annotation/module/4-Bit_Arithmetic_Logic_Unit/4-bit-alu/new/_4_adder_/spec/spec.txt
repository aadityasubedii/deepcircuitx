Module name: adder4. Module specification: The `adder4` module is designed to perform the addition of two 4-bit binary numbers, labelled as inputs A and B. It generates a 5-bit output, SUM, where SUM[4:0] encapsulates the results of the addition, with SUM[4] serving as the carry-out bit, indicating an overflow for wider bit-width addition operations. The module employs four instances of the `full_adder` submodule to implement bit-wise addition across the four bits. The interconnections among these submodules use internal signals, c1, c2, and c3, which serve as carry propagators between the successive addition stages. Specifically, c1 forwards the carry from the addition of the least significant bits to the next stage, while c2 and c3 perform analogous roles for the middle bit additions, culminating in the carry-out summed in SUM[4]. This structured usage of full adders implements a cascaded addition, crucial for obtaining accurate results in the designated 5-bit format outcome, allowing for correct and systematic binary addition within a digital circuit design.
