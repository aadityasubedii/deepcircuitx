It utilizes instances of a `subr` submodule for each bit of the operands A and B, which likely handles individual bit subtraction including borrow in and borrow out. This is performed sequentially from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. The final output DIFF includes four bits of the direct subtraction result and one additional bit for the final borrow out, indicating if there was an underflow in the subtraction."
