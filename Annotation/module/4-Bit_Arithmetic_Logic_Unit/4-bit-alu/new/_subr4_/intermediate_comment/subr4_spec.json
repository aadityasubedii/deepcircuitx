    "spec": "Module name: subr4. Module specification: The `subr4` module is designed for 4-bit binary subtraction between two input signals A and B, resulting in a 5-bit difference output. The input ports are two 4-bit signals, 'A' and 'B', where 'A' serves as the minuend and 'B' as the subtrahend. The output 'DIFF' is a 5-bit signal, with 'DIFF[3:0]' representing the result of the subtraction, and 'DIFF[4]' indicating the final borrow-out, showing underflow if B is greater than A. Inside the module, three internal wire signals, 'c1', 'c2', and 'c3', function as borrow lines, propagating the borrow from one bit-level subtraction to the next. The module encompasses instances of a sub-module `subr`, each handling the subtraction of corresponding bits from A and B, starting from the least significant bit. The first submodule `subr s1` processes the least significant bits with an initial carry (borrow) of 0, while each subsequent submodule `subr` takes as the borrow input the borrow output from the previous submodule. The borrow output from the subtraction of the most significant bits is directly connected to 'DIFF[4]'. This modular architecture ensures the correct calculation of each bit of the result and the final borrow-out, reflecting comprehensive chaining and dependency management typical in multi-bit arithmetic operations.",
