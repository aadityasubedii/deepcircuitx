    "module": "The `subr4` module performs a 4-bit subtraction between two inputs, A and B, and outputs a 5-bit difference. It employs four instances of a `subr` submodule, each handling the subtraction of corresponding bit pairs from A and B, starting from the least significant bit. Internal borrow lines (c1, c2, c3) propagate borrow from one bit-level operation to the next, with the final borrow indicating overflow as the fifth bit of the output."
