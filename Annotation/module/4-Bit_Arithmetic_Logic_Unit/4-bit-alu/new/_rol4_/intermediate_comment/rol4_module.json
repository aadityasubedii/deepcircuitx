    "module": "The 'rol4' module performs a left bit rotation on a 4-bit input 'in' by a number of positions specified by the 2-bit input 's'. The module achieves this functionality through a single assignment statement, where the 'out' output directly receives the rotated version of 'in' based on the value of 's', without the use of internal signals or additional code blocks, ensuring efficient and direct bit manipulation."
