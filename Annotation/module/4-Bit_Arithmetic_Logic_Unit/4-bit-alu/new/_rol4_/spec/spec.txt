Module name: rol4. Module specification: The 'rol4' module is designed to perform a left shift or rotation on a 4-bit binary input, denoted as 'in'. The number of positions to shift is specified by a 2-bit input called 's'. The result of this operation is given in the 4-bit output 'out'. This module utilizes its inputs 'in' and 's' directly without any internal signals, performing the rotation operation succinctly within a single assignment statement. The Verilog code for this module contains no internal blocks or additional logical sections, keeping it streamlined and focused solely on the shifting functionality. It efficiently carries out the bit rotation through the 'assign' statement, mapping the shifted value of 'in' directly to 'out' based on the value of 's'. The simplicity of this module's design aids in easy integration and maintenance in larger systems where bit rotation operations are required.
