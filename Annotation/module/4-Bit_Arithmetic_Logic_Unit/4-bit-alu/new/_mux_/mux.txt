The 'mux' module serves as a template for a multiplexer, designed to select one of several 4-bit input signals (in0 to in5) to route through an 8-bit output (out). Currently, it lacks internal logic and selection mechanisms, serving only as a structural framework with defined input and output ports needing further implementation to be functional.
