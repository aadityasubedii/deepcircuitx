The mux16 module serves as a 16-to-1 multiplexer which selects one of eight input signals based on a 3-bit selection input and outputs the selected signal in a 9-bit output register. This is implemented using a case statement within an always block that assigns the selected input directly to the output based on the selector value, ensuring efficient data routing without intermediate processing.
