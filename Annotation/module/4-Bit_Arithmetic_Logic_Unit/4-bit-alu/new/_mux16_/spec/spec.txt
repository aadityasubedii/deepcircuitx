Module name: mux16. Module specification: The 'mux16' module operates as a 16-to-1 multiplexer within a Verilog environment, selecting one of eight inputs based on a 3-bit selector and outputting the chosen input through a 9-bit output register. The selection input ‘sel’ determines which of the 8 inputs (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) is routed to the output ‘out’. Inputs 'a' and 'b' are 5 bits each, inputs 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', and 'g' are each 4 bits, and 'h' is the widest, at 8 bits. The output ‘out’ is a 9-bit register to ensure all potentially incoming data widths, particularly from 'h', can be accommodated without truncation. The module doesn't explicitly use internal signals beyond utilizing the ‘case’ statement within an ‘always @(*)’ block to handle the selection logic—depending on the 'sel' value, the appropriate input is connected directly to the output 'out'.
In summary, the module implements the selection logic entirely through multiplexer-like behavior in its 'case' statements, mapping each value of 'sel' to corresponding inputs without intermediate processing or storage. This basic structure emphasizes efficiency and clarity in multiplexing applications.
