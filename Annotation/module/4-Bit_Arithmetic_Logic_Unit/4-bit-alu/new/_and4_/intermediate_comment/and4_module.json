    "module": "The 'and4' module performs a bitwise AND operation on two 4-bit input vectors 'a' and 'b', producing a 4-bit output vector 'out' where each output bit is the AND of corresponding input bits. This functionality is implemented by directly mapping each bit pair ('a[i]', 'b[i]') to an individual 'and' gate named and1 through and4, respectively for each bit 'out[0]' to 'out[3]', thereby simplifying the design by omitting internal signals and directly using the basic gates."
