    "spec": "Module name: and4. Module specification: The 'and4' module is designed in Verilog to perform bitwise AND operations between two 4-bit inputs, labeled 'a' and 'b'. Each bit of the input vectors 'a' and 'b' is ANDed correspondingly, resulting in a 4-bit output vector 'out'. The inputs 'a' and 'b' are both 4-bit vectors where each bit provides operands for the AND operations. The output 'out' is also a 4-bit vector, with each bit representing the result of the bitwise AND operation for each bit position in the input vectors. The module leverages direct connections to instantiate four 'and' gates named and1, and2, and3, and4, where each 'and' gate specifically handles the operation for one bit of the output: 'out[0]' is computed from 'a[0]' and 'b[0]', 'out[1]' from 'a[1]' and 'b[1]', up to 'out[3]' from 'a[3]' and 'b[3]'. The module does not utilize any internal signals as it directly wires inputs to the output through these gates, simplifying its structure and functionality. This direct approach encapsulates the entire operational logic within the instantiation of the 'and' gates, each tailored to process concurrent bitwise operations across the input and output bit vectors.",
