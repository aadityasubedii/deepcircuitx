The `full_adder` module computes the sum and carry from three binary inputs (a, b, c). It determines the 'sum' output by performing a bitwise XOR (a ^ b ^ c) across the inputs, and computes the 'carry' output using a combination of AND and OR operations ((a & b) | (b & c) | (c & a)), indicating an overflow to a higher bit if at least two inputs are high. This design allows for straightforward addition of single-bit values without intermediate signals.
