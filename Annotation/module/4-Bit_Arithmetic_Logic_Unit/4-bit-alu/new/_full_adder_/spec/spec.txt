Module name: full_adder. Module specification: The full_adder is a Verilog module designed to calculate the sum and carry outputs from three input bits. The inputs of this module are 'a', 'b', and 'c', which are single-bit binary values representing the bits to be added. The outputs include 'sum', which is the result of a bitwise XOR operation across the three inputs, providing the binary sum of these bits. The 'carry' output indicates if there is an overflow from the addition, meaning it will be high (1) if any two of the three input bits are high. This is achieved by a combination of AND and OR operations (a & b) | (b & c) | (c & a). The module does not utilize any internal signals; instead, it directly assigns the computed results to the output ports using simple assignment statements. This compact design efficiently encapsulates the fundamental logic of a full adder in hardware description form using concise and direct operations without intermediate variables or storage.
