It produces a sum output by performing a bitwise XOR operation across all three inputs, effectively adding them. The carry output is determined by checking if any two of the three inputs are high (logical 1), using a combination of AND and OR operations, which is typical in binary addition to report an overflow to the next higher bit."

These inputs are the bits that are to be added together.\n\nOutput ports: sum, carry.\nExplanation: The 'sum' output port provides the single-bit result of the bitwise XOR operation on the three input bits, representing the sum of the input bits. The 'carry' output port gives a single-bit output that represents the carry result of the addition; it is high (1) if any two of the three input bits are high, indicating an overflow that is passed to the next higher bit in multi-bit addition scenarios."

The XOR and combination of AND and OR logic gates are employed directly in the output assignment statements without any intermediate storage or manipulation through internal signals."
