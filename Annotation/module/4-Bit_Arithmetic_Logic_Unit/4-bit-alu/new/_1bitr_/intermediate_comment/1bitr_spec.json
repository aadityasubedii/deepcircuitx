    "spec": "Module name: ror4. \nModule specification: The \"ror4\" module is designed to perform a right arithmetic shift operation on a 4-bit input signal. It accepts two inputs: 'in', a 4-bit data signal to be shifted, and 's', a 2-bit signal specifying the number of positions to shift the 'in' signal to the right. The result of this operation is output through the 'out' port, which is also 4-bit wide. The module straightforwardly assigns the shifted result to the output, utilizing the right shift operator (>>) in Verilog. There are no internal signals utilized in this module, as the arithmetic operation is directly linked from input to output without intermediate processing or storage. The code consists mainly of the 'assign' statement directly in the module's body, making the operation and the structural simplicity clear and efficient.",
