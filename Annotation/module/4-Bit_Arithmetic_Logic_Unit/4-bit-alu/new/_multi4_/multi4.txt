The 'multi4' module performs a 4-bit by 4-bit multiplication, yielding an 8-bit product. It computes this by first generating partial products for each bit pair from the inputs, then summing these products using a series of three 4-bit adders. The outcome of each addition stage cascades to the next, ensuring correct bit alignment and accumulation into the final product stored in 'pro'.
