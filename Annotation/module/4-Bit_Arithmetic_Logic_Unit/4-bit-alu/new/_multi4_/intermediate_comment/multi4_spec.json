    "spec": "Module name: multi4. Module specification: The 'multi4' module is designed to perform a 4-bit multiplication between two input operands, 'in1' and 'in2', resulting in an 8-bit product, 'pro'. The input ports, 'in1' and 'in2', each accept a 4-bit binary number used to generate the multiplication's partial products. The output port, 'pro', is an 8-bit port that carries the final product of the multiplication. Internally, the module employs several signals, such as 'a00' to 'a33', representing the bitwise AND results of the multipliers, and 'c00' to 'c09', which are carry and sum outputs from interim addition stages. This multiplication is implemented through generating partial products (via bitwise AND operations between 'in1' and 'in2') and summing these products using three instances of a 4-bit adder ('adder4'). The first adder sums the partial products from the least significant bits, the output of which is carried forward and added to more significant partial products by the subsequent adders. The sequential addition of anchored, shifted partial products ensures correct alignment and summation of bits to yield the precise final product. The code is structured into segments initializing partial products, defining the operational block of adders, and mapping the final output bits to the 'pro' output port.",

Each 'aXY' signal captures the result of the AND operation between bit 'X' of input 'in1' and bit 'Y' of input 'in2'. For example, 'a12' is the result of AND-ing the second bit of 'in1' with the third bit of 'in2'. These partial products are then aligned according to their respective weights (bit significance) in the overall 8-bit product.\n\nThe signals [c00 to c09] are intermediary carry-out values and sums resulting from the addition of these partial products using the 'adder4' instances. For example:\n- 'c00 to c04' are the outputs from the first adder which sums [a13, a12, a11, a10] (shifted partial products from in2[1]) and [{1'b0, a03, a02, a01}] (shifted partial products from in2[0]).\n- 'c05 to c09' are from the second adder which takes the output of the first adder [c04, c03, c02, c01] and adds it to [a23, a22, a21, a20] (shifted partial products from in2[2]).\n- The third adder produces the higher portion of the final product by adding [c09, c08, c07, c06] (output from second adder) to [a33, a32, a31, a30] (shifted partial products from in2[3]), and the result is connected to the higher bits of the output 'pro'.\n\nThese signals are crucial in ensuring that the partial product bits are correctly summed and the correct weighted significance is maintained, allowing 'pro' to represent the accurate 8-bit product of 'in1' and 'in2'."
