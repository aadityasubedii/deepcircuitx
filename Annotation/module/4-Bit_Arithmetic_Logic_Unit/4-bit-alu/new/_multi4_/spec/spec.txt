Module name: multi4. Module specification: The 'multi4' module is designed to perform a 4-bit multiplication between two input operands, 'in1' and 'in2', resulting in an 8-bit product, 'pro'. The input ports, 'in1' and 'in2', each accept a 4-bit binary number used to generate the multiplication's partial products. The output port, 'pro', is an 8-bit port that carries the final product of the multiplication. Internally, the module employs several signals, such as 'a00' to 'a33', representing the bitwise AND results of the multipliers, and 'c00' to 'c09', which are carry and sum outputs from interim addition stages. This multiplication is implemented through generating partial products (via bitwise AND operations between 'in1' and 'in2') and summing these products using three instances of a 4-bit adder ('adder4'). The first adder sums the partial products from the least significant bits, the output of which is carried forward and added to more significant partial products by the subsequent adders. The sequential addition of anchored, shifted partial products ensures correct alignment and summation of bits to yield the precise final product. The code is structured into segments initializing partial products, defining the operational block of adders, and mapping the final output bits to the 'pro' output port.
