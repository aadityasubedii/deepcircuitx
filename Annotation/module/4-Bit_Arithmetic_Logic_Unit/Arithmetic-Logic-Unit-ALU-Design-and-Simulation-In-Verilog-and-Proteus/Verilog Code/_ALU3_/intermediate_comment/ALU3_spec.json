    "spec": "Module name: ALU3.  \nModule specification: The 'ALU3' module functions as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), crucial for carrying out various arithmetic and logical operations determined by its inputs. It accepts two 4-bit operands, 'A' and 'B', and a 4-bit control signal 'ALU_Sel' that specifies the operation to perform. Additionally, there is a 'CarryIn' input that influences operations requiring a carry or borrow, such as addition or subtraction. The module outputs a 4-bit 'ALU_Result' holding the result of the selected operation, and a 'CarryOut' signal indicating an overflow or carry from the operation. Internally, the module utilizes a 5-bit register 'tmp' for handling intermediate values and carry generation, where tmp[4] serves as the carry-out flag in specific operations. The code features a combinational always block triggered by changes in 'A', 'B', 'ALU_Sel', or 'CarryIn'. Within this block, a case statement evaluates 'ALU_Sel' to execute the appropriate operation: basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction with and without 'CarryIn'), bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR), and comparisons (less than, greater than, equality). Each operation sets 'ALU_Result' and updates 'CarryOut' as needed. The versatility and comprehensive implementation of logic in the ALU3 make it suitable for integration into larger digital systems requiring diversified arithmetic and logical functionality.",

The operation to be performed is determined by the 4-bit 'ALU_Sel' (ALU Selection) input. The module can add, subtract, perform bitwise AND, OR, XOR, XNOR, NOR, and NAND operations, and can compare values for equality and inequalities. It also optionally incorporates a 'CarryIn' for operations that involve carry (like addition and subtraction), and outputs a 'CarryOut' to indicate an overflow in such cases.

Each combination of the bits represents different operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise operations, and comparisons.\n- CarryIn: This single-bit input is used in operations that involve carry, such as addition or subtraction, providing an initial carry-in value which is important for chained arithmetic operations in wider data paths or in multi-stage processing architectures.\n\nOutput ports: [CarryOut, ALU_Result].\nExplanation:\n- CarryOut: This single-bit output indicates an overflow or carry out resulting from operations that generate a carry.

By designating the fifth bit of 'tmp' (tmp[4]) to represent the carry-out, it efficiently facilitates carry propagation between chained ALU operations or multi-stage processes.
