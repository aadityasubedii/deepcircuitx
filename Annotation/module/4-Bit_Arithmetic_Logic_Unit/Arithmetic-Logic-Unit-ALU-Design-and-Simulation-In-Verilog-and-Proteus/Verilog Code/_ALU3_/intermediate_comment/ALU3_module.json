    "module": "The ALU3 module serves as an Arithmetic Logic Unit that performs various arithmetic and logical operations based on inputs: two 4-bit operands A and B, a 4-bit operation selector ALU_Sel, and a CarryIn bit. Operations include addition, subtraction (with and without CarryIn), bitwise AND, OR, XOR, as well as comparisons. Results are provided in the 4-bit ALU_Result, and CarryOut indicates overflow or additional carry. Operations are managed within a combinational block, using a case statement to handle different operations based on ALU_Sel, while a 5-bit internal register 'tmp' aids in intermediate storage and carry propagation."
