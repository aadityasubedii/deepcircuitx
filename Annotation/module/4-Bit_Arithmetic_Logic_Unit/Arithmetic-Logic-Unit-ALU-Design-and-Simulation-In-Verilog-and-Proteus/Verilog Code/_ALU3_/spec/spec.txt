Module name: ALU3.  
Module specification: The 'ALU3' module functions as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), crucial for carrying out various arithmetic and logical operations determined by its inputs. It accepts two 4-bit operands, 'A' and 'B', and a 4-bit control signal 'ALU_Sel' that specifies the operation to perform. Additionally, there is a 'CarryIn' input that influences operations requiring a carry or borrow, such as addition or subtraction. The module outputs a 4-bit 'ALU_Result' holding the result of the selected operation, and a 'CarryOut' signal indicating an overflow or carry from the operation. Internally, the module utilizes a 5-bit register 'tmp' for handling intermediate values and carry generation, where tmp[4] serves as the carry-out flag in specific operations. The code features a combinational always block triggered by changes in 'A', 'B', 'ALU_Sel', or 'CarryIn'. Within this block, a case statement evaluates 'ALU_Sel' to execute the appropriate operation: basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction with and without 'CarryIn'), bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR), and comparisons (less than, greater than, equality). Each operation sets 'ALU_Result' and updates 'CarryOut' as needed. The versatility and comprehensive implementation of logic in the ALU3 make it suitable for integration into larger digital systems requiring diversified arithmetic and logical functionality.
