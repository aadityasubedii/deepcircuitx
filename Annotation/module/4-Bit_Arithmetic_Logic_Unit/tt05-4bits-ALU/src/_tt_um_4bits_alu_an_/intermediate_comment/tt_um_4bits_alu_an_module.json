    "module": "The tt_um_4bits_alu_an module employs an embedded ALU to execute various arithmetic and logical operations determined by the input operands and operation codes. It manages data through defined inputs; \"A\" and \"B\" are derived from an 8-bit `ui_in`, an operation code and carry-in are extracted from `uio_in`, coordinating operations with control signals `ena`, `clk`, and `rst_n`. The results are output through `uo_out` while output controls (`uio_out`, `uio_oe`) are set to inactive, embodying a focus on internal computation and signal flow management within the encapsulated ALU submodule."
