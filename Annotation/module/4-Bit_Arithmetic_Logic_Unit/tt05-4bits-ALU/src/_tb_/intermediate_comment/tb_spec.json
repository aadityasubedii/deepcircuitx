Module specification: The \"tb\" module serves as a testbench for the embedded \"tt_um_4bits_alu_an\" module, primarily aimed at testing its functionality under various conditions. The module does not have external input or output ports since it functions independently as a testbench. Key internal signals include `clk` (clock signal), `rst_n` (active low reset), `ena` (enable signal), and `ui_in` and `uio_in` (8-bit input buses). Output signals captured are `uo_out`, `uio_out` (8-bit output for the bidirectional bus), and `uio_oe` (output enable for the bidirectional bus). The module initiates with setting up a VCD file (\"tb.vcd\") for logging waveform data of internal signals, followed by instantiating the \"tt_um_4bits_alu_an\" module and connecting these signals to simulate and monitor its behavior. This encapsulation and simulation allow for robust functionality verification of the embedded ALU, designed to handle logical and arithmetic operations as dictated by input conditions provided through the testbench setup.",

It regularly toggles between high and low states, driving the sequential logic in the module.\n- `rst_n`: Active low reset signal that is used to reset the internal state of the `tt_um_4bits_alu_an` module to a known initial state.\n- `ena`: Enable signal acts as a control input that determines whether the `tt_um_4bits_alu_an` module should perform its operations. When high, the module is enabled, and when low, the module's operations are disabled.\n- `ui_in`: This is a purely input signal to the `tt_um_4bits_alu_an` module serving as an 8-bit input data bus. It is used to provide input data which the module processes based on its functionality.\n- `uio_in`: Serves as part of a bidirectional interface, initially acting as an input to the `tt_um_4bits_alu_an` module. It carries additional 8-bit data that can be used by the module or passed through it.\n- `uo_out`: An output signal from the `tt_um_4bits_alu_an` module which holds the output of any calculations or logical operations performed within the module. It is an 8-bit wide unidirectional output data bus.\n- `uio_out`: Functions as the output part of the bidirectional interface, which can either send data out based on the `tt_um_4bits_alu_an` module's operations or reflect the input from `uio_in` depending on the control logic.\n- `uio_oe`: Output enable signal for the bidirectional port `uio_out`. It controls whether `uio_out` acts as an output or `uio_in` is allowed to act as an active input to the module."
