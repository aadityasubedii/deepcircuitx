It regularly toggles between high and low states, driving the sequential logic in the module.\n- `rst_n`: Active low reset signal that is used to reset the internal state of the `tt_um_4bits_alu_an` module to a known initial state.\n- `ena`: Enable signal acts as a control input that determines whether the `tt_um_4bits_alu_an` module should perform its operations. When high, the module is enabled, and when low, the module's operations are disabled.\n- `ui_in`: This is a purely input signal to the `tt_um_4bits_alu_an` module serving as an 8-bit input data bus. It is used to provide input data which the module processes based on its functionality.\n- `uio_in`: Serves as part of a bidirectional interface, initially acting as an input to the `tt_um_4bits_alu_an` module. It carries additional 8-bit data that can be used by the module or passed through it.\n- `uo_out`: An output signal from the `tt_um_4bits_alu_an` module which holds the output of any calculations or logical operations performed within the module.
