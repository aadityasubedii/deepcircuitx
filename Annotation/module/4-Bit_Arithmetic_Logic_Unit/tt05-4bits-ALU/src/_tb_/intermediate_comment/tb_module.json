    "module": "The \"tb\" module functions as a testbench for testing the \"tt_um_4bits_alu_an\" module, focusing on simulating and verifying its operations under various inputs. It initializes waveform logging via a VCD file, setups and maintains a simulation environment by defining and managing internal control and data signals such as `clk`, `rst_n`, `ena`, `ui_in`, `uio_in`, and monitors outputs `uo_out`, `uio_out`, `uio_oe` to validate the operational correctness of the instantiated module."
