Module name: tb. Module specification: The "tb" module serves as a testbench for the embedded "tt_um_4bits_alu_an" module, primarily aimed at testing its functionality under various conditions. The module does not have external input or output ports since it functions independently as a testbench. Key internal signals include `clk` (clock signal), `rst_n` (active low reset), `ena` (enable signal), and `ui_in` and `uio_in` (8-bit input buses). Output signals captured are `uo_out`, `uio_out` (8-bit output for the bidirectional bus), and `uio_oe` (output enable for the bidirectional bus). The module initiates with setting up a VCD file ("tb.vcd") for logging waveform data of internal signals, followed by instantiating the "tt_um_4bits_alu_an" module and connecting these signals to simulate and monitor its behavior. This encapsulation and simulation allow for robust functionality verification of the embedded ALU, designed to handle logical and arithmetic operations as dictated by input conditions provided through the testbench setup.
