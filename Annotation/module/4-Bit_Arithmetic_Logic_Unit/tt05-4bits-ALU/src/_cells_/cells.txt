The `dffsr_cell` module is a D flip-flop with set and reset capabilities, designed to store data based on the clock signal, while allowing for immediate set or reset overrides. It operates with an always block triggered by the positive edges of `clk`, `s`, or `r`, prioritizing reset and set conditions before falling back to storing the incoming data `d`, with outputs `q` and its inverse `notq`.
