Module name: dffsr_cell. Module specification: The `dffsr_cell` module is a D-type flip-flop with set and reset functionality, utilized for digital memory elements in logic circuits. It captures and holds data based on the clock signal, with prioritized set and reset conditions. The module includes three input ports: `clk` (clock signal, triggers the update on the rising edge), `d` (data input, primary data to be stored in the output), `s` (set signal, sets output to 1), and `r` (reset signal, resets the output to 0). It has two outputs: `q` (main output that holds the data or responds to set/reset conditions), and `notq` (`q`'s logical negation). The internal signals primarily include procedural blocks handling the logic for setting, resetting, and data storage conditioned by the clock signal. This encapsulation includes an always block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, `s`, or `r`, which determines the output based on the states of `r` and `s` before defaulting to the state of `d` if neither set nor reset are activated. This design provides a robust flip-flop mechanism essential for reliable data holding in synchronous digital systems.
