            "content": "Name of the module and its functionality is as follows: \nModule name: buffer_cell. Explanation: This module simply passes the input signal 'in' directly to the output signal 'out', effectively acting as a buffer.\n\nModule name: and_cell. Explanation: This module performs a logical AND operation on two input signals 'a' and 'b', and produces the result as the output signal 'out'.\n\nModule name: or_cell. Explanation: This module performs a logical OR operation on two input signals 'a' and 'b', and outputs the result as the output signal 'out'.\n\nModule name: xor_cell. Explanation: This module computes the logical exclusive OR (XOR) of the two input signals 'a' and 'b' and provides the result as the output signal 'out'.\n\nModule name: nand_cell. Explanation: This module performs a logical NAND operation, which is the negation of the AND operation, on the input signals 'a' and 'b', and outputs the result as the output signal 'out'.\n\nModule name: not_cell. Explanation: This module inverts the input signal 'in' and produces the negated output as the output signal 'out'.\n\nModule name: mux_cell. Explanation: This module selects between two input signals 'a' and 'b' based on the value of the select signal 'sel'. If 'sel' is true, output 'b' is selected, otherwise output 'a' is selected.\n\nModule name: dff_cell. Explanation: This is a D flip-flop module that captures the value of the input 'd' on the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk' and holds it until the next clock event. It outputs this value through 'q' and provides the inverse of the output through 'notq'.\n\nModule name: dffsr_cell. Explanation: This is a D flip-flop with set and reset functionality. Depending on the signals, if 'r' (reset) is high, the output 'q' is set to 0. If 's' (set) is high, the output 'q' is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of 'd' is loaded into 'q' at the rising edge of clock 'clk'. Output 'notq' provides the negation of 'q'."
