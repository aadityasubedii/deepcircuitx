Explanation: This module simply passes the input signal 'in' directly to the output signal 'out', effectively acting as a buffer.\n\nModule name: and_cell. Explanation: This module performs a logical AND operation on two input signals 'a' and 'b', and produces the result as the output signal 'out'.\n\nModule name: or_cell. Explanation: This module performs a logical OR operation on two input signals 'a' and 'b', and outputs the result as the output signal 'out'.\n\nModule name: xor_cell. Explanation: This module computes the logical exclusive OR (XOR) of the two input signals 'a' and 'b' and provides the result as the output signal 'out'.\n\nModule name: nand_cell.

Depending on the signals, if 'r' (reset) is high, the output 'q' is set to 0. If 's' (set) is high, the output 'q' is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of 'd' is loaded into 'q' at the rising edge of clock 'clk'. Output 'notq' provides the negation of 'q'."
