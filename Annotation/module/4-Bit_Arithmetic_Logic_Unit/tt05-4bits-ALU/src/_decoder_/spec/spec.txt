Module name: seg7. Module specification: The 'seg7' module is designed for driving a 7-segment display based on a 4-bit input. It notably transforms a 4-bit binary input, 'counter', into a 7-bit output, 'segments', where each bit of the output corresponds to one of the segments on a 7-segment display. The 'counter' input port receives the hexadecimal value (ranging from 0x0 to 0xF) to be displayed, which is processed internally to determine the configuration of the display's segments. The output port, 'segments', outputs the pattern required to appropriately light up the display to show the desired digit or hexadecimal character. Internally, the module implements a 'case' statement within an 'always' block that maps specific patterns to the 'segments' output based on the 'counter' value. For undefined 'counter' values, all segments are turned off, ensuring a fail-safe state for the display. This structure makes the module highly suitable for applications like digital clocks, numeric displays in industrials panels, or any electronics requiring hexadecimal data representation.
