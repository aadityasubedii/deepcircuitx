The module maps each hexadecimal value of 'counter' from 0x0 to 0xF to a specific pattern on a 7-segment display, which is useful for displaying hexadecimal digits in a readable form on such displays.

Different patterns of bits in this signal activate specific segments on the display, enabling representation of hexadecimal digits.
