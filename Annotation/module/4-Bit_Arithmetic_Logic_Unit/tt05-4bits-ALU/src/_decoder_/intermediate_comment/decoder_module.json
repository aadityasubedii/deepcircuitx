    "module": "The 'seg7' module converts a 4-bit binary input 'counter' into a 7-bit output 'segments', mapping each hexadecimal digit from 0x0 to 0xF to a pattern for a 7-segment display. Utilizing a 'case' statement within an 'always' block, the module defines specific segment configurations that correspond to each input value, reverting to all segments off for undefined inputs, effectively addressing both digit representation and error states in displays."
