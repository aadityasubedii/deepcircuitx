    "module": "The multiplier module performs multiplication on two 4-bit inputs, A and B, and outputs an 8-bit product, managed by an enable signal, E. Internally, it employs bitwise AND operations to generate partial products, uses a series of XOR and AND gates for carry-propagated addition, and gates the final output with E to limit output activity when not enabled, fulfilling requirements for embedded arithmetic operations in digital circuits."
