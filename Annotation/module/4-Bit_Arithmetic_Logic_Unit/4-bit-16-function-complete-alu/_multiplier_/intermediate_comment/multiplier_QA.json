The module also includes an enable input E, which controls whether the computed product is passed to the output p or not. When E is high, the product is outputted; otherwise, the output remains low (assuming zeroed or disabled by default). The multiplication logic is decomposed into bitwise AND and XOR operations which are further managed through carry handling to generate each bit of the result. This kind of architecture is commonly used in building arithmetic logic units or performing arithmetic operations in digital circuits."

Each c[x] helps manage the carry from each stage of addition.\n\n- **a (wire [11:0]):** These wires are used to hold the intermediate ANDed results of input A with each bit of input B, handling different shifts appropriate to the bit-wise multiplication process. The array is designed such that a[0] to a[3], a[4] to a[7], and a[8] to a[11] correspond to A ANDed with B[1], B[2], and B[3] respectively.\n\n- **b (wire [11:0]):** Similar to 'a', 'b' holds the ANDed results of shifted versions of input A with the least significant bit B[0] across the entire multiplication process. These intermediate results are used to calculate each bit of the product.\n\n- **w (wire [35:0]):** These are working wires used extensively for bitwise operations throughout the module. They handle intermediate XOR operations, AND operations for further carry developments, and form an essential part of the data manipulation in the multiplication algorithm.\n\n- **pWire (wire [7:0]):** This wire is basically the direct result of the multiplier before factoring in the enable signal E.
