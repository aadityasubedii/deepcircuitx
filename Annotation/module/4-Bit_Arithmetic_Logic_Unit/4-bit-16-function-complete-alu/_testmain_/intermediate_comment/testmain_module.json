    "module": "The `testmain` module functions as a testbench for the `mainalu` module, facilitating the simulation of logical and arithmetic operations by providing predefined inputs and capturing outputs. It initializes control flags (A, B, C, D) and data vectors (a, b) with specific binary values, connecting these inputs to `mainalu` and then observing outputs such as logical operations, arithmetic results, and inversions via a collection of wire outputs after a delay, to evaluate the correctness of `mainalu` operations."
