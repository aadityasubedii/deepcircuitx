    "module": "The `EVEN` module is designed to demonstrate the functionality of the `evenparity` submodule, which calculates the even parity for two 4-bit inputs. It includes input registers 'a', 'b', and 'E', where 'a' and 'b' are data inputs and 'E' potentially acts as a control signal. The outputs 'ansA' and 'ansB' depict the parity results for 'a' and 'b'. The module encapsulates the `evenparity` instantiation and initializes input values followed by a simulation delay to test and observe the parity computation's response."
