The `orgate` module performs a bitwise OR operation on two 4-bit inputs, a and b, delivering a 4-bit output s, where each output bit is the OR result of the corresponding input bits. It employs four OR gates directly connected to each input bit pair and the corresponding output bit, ensuring direct mapping and minimal internal complexity.
