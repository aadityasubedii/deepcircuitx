    "spec": "Module name: orgate. Module specification: The 'orgate' module in Verilog is designed to perform a bitwise OR operation on two 4-bit inputs, `a` and `b`, producing a 4-bit output `s`. Each bit of the output `s` is the result of the OR operation on the corresponding bits from inputs `a` and `b`. The module defines two input ports, `a` and `b`, both 4-bit wide, which are intended to receive the binary values for the OR operation. The output port, `s`, also 4-bit wide, is used to output the result of the OR operations. There are no internal signals explicitly defined or utilized in this module as the operations are conducted directly on the inputs and the results are immediately assigned to the output ports. The code structure includes the instantiation of four `or` gates, each corresponding to one bit of the input vectors `a` and `b`, with the results directly mapped to the respective bits of the output vector `s`. This straightforward implementation ensures that the `orgate` module efficiently performs the desired bitwise OR operation without any intermediary processing or signal manipulation.",
