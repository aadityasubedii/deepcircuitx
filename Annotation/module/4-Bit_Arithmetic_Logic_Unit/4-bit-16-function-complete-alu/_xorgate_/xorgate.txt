The 'xorgate' module implements a 4-bit bitwise XOR operation between two input vectors 'a' and 'b', producing a 4-bit output vector 'xs'. Each bit of the input vectors is XORed independently to compute the corresponding output bit, directly wiring XOR gates from inputs to outputs, without using any internal signals, ensuring straightforward and efficient logic execution.
