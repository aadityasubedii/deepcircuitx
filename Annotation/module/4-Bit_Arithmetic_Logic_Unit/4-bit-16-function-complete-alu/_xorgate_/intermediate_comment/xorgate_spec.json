    "spec": "Module name: xorgate. Module specification: The 'xorgate' module is designed to perform a 4-bit bitwise XOR operation between two 4-bit binary input vectors, 'a' and 'b'. Each bit from these vectors is independently XORed to generate a corresponding bit in the 4-bit output vector 'xs'. Specifically, the bits a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], a[2] and b[2], and a[3] and b[3] are XORed to produce xs[0], xs[1], xs[2], and xs[3] respectively. The input ports are `a` and `b`, both 4-bit vectors used as operands in the XOR operations. The output port is `xs`, also a 4-bit vector that stores the result of the XOR operations. There are no internal signals used in this module as all operations directly connect inputs to outputs through XOR logic gates. The code is organized into a simple module structure with direct assignments in the logic gate connections, providing a clear and efficient implementation of the defined functionality.",
