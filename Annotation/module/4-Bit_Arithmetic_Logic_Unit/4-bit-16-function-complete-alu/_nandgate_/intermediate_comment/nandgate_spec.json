    "spec": "Module name: nandgate. Module specification: The 'nandgate' module is designed to perform bitwise NAND operations on two 4-bit input vectors, 'a' and 'b', and outputs a 4-bit vector 'iab'. Each bit of the output vector 'iab' is generated by applying the NAND operation to the corresponding bits of the input vectors. Specifically, 'iab[0]' is the result of NANDing 'a[0]' and 'b[0]', and so forth for each subsequent bit up to 'iab[3]'. The input ports are 'a' and 'b', each being 4-bit vectors that provide the binary data to be processed. The output port is 'iab', which holds the result of the bitwise NAND operations. There are no internal signals in this module, as each output bit is computed directly from the inputs using NAND gates, without intermediate storage or processing. The code consists of the module declaration, input and output port definitions, and the instantiation of four NAND gates, each directly producing a bit of the output vector. This straightforward structure facilitates direct computation from inputs to output, ensuring efficient and clear operations within the module.",
