Each bit of the output vector is the result of the NAND operation on the corresponding bits of input vectors 'a' and 'b'. Thus, 'iab[0]' is the NAND of 'a[0]' and 'b[0]', and similarly for the other bits. This module is essentially performing bit-wise NAND operations between two 4-bit numbers."

'a' and 'b' essentially provide the binary data whose bits are to be NANDed together in the module.\n\nOutput ports: iab.\nExplanation: The output port 'iab' is a 4-bit vector.

For example, 'iab[0]' is the result of NANDing 'a[0]' and 'b[0]', and this pattern follows for the other bits in the vector.

Each bit of the output vector 'iab' is directly computed by performing a NAND operation on the corresponding bits of the input vectors 'a' and 'b' using the NAND gates instantiated in the module.
