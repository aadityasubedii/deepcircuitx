The 'nandgate' module performs bitwise NAND operations on two 4-bit input vectors, 'a' and 'b', to produce a 4-bit output vector 'iab'. It directly computes each bit of 'iab' by NANDing the corresponding bits of 'a' and 'b' through four independent NAND gates, with each gate outputting one bit of the result vector, making the design efficient and straightforward.
