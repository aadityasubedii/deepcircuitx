Module name: oddparity. 
Module specification: The "oddparity" module calculates the odd parity for two 4-bit input vectors `a` and `b`. It has three input ports: (1) `a` is a 4-bit vector, representing the first operand for the parity calculation, (2) `b`, also a 4-bit vector, is the second operand, and (3) `E` is a single-bit enable input that when set (high), activates the module outputs `ansA` and `ansB`. These outputs, `ansA` and `ansB`, reveal the odd parity results of vectors `a` and `b` respectively, each gated by the signal `E`, ensuring outputs are valid only when the enable signal is high. Inside the module, there are internal signals `w[0]` to `w[3]` and `wireAns[0]` to `wireAns[3]`. The wires from `w[0]` to `w[3]` assist in intermediate XOR operations to simplify the calculation of parity. `wireAns[0]` and `wireAns[1]` hold the final computed odd parity results of `a` and `b`. Contrarily, `wireAns[2]` and `wireAns[3]` are the negated versions of `wireAns[0]` and `wireAns[1]`, respectively. The module concludes with logical AND gates where these final results are gated by the enable signal `E` to produce the final active outputs `ansA` and `ansB`. This structured implementation ensures a comprehensible flow from inputs through logical operations to the conditioned outputs based on the enable signal.
