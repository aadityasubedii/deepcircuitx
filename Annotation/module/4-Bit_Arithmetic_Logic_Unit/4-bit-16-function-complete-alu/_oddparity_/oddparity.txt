The oddparity module calculates the odd parity for two 4-bit vectors `a` and `b`, producing two conditioned outputs `ansA` and `ansB` based on an enable signal `E`. Internally, it utilizes XOR and NOT gates to determine odd parity, and the outputs are gated by `E` using AND gates, ensuring results are active only when enabled.
