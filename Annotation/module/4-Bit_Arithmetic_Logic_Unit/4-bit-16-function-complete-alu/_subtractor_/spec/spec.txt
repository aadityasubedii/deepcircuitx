Module name: subtractor. 
Module specification: The "subtractor" module is designed to compute the subtraction of two 4-bit binary numbers, providing outputs only when an enable signal is high. It accepts two 4-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', where 'a' is the minuend and 'b' is the subtrahend, and an enable signal 'E'. The outputs include a 4-bit difference 'd' and a single bit 'bout' which indicates a borrow out, particularly useful for indicating underflow conditions. Internally, the module utilizes several signals such as 'd0' to 'd3' to store bitwise subtraction results and 'b1' to 'b3' to hold intermediate borrow information. An array of wires 'w[20:1]' handles various logic operationsâ€”XOR for initial differences, ANDs and NOTs for borrow calculations. The code is organized into sections where each bit's subtraction is handled sequentially, including the calculation of the necessary borrow bits. Finally, the enable logic uses AND gates to control the output of the final result based on the state of 'E'. This structured approach ensures that the module operates efficiently and addresses both the calculation and conditional output requirements.
