The inputs are two 4-bit operands 'a' and 'b' and an enable signal 'E'. The outputs are a 4-bit difference 'd' and a borrow out 'bout'. Each bit of the difference is calculated using XOR gates for basic subtraction, and the borrow logic is handled through a series of AND, OR, and NOT gates to create the necessary borrow chain that influences the subtraction of higher order bits. The subtraction result is passed through an AND gate with the enable signal 'E' to allow control over when the output is active."
