    "module": "The subtractor module performs the subtraction of two 4-bit binary numbers, enabling outputs based on a high signal from the 'E' enable input. It computes each bit of the result using XOR gates for direct subtraction, manages borrow through AND, OR, and NOT gates across subsequent bits, and applies the enable signal via AND gates to control the final output, ensuring outputs are generated only when enabled."
