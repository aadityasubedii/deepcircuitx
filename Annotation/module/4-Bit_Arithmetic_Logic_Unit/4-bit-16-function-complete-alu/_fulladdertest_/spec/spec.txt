Module name: fulladdertest. Module specification: The 'fulladdertest' module is designed to rigorously test a full adder circuit by simulating its truth table and checking the behavior over all possible input combinations. It incorporates an instance of the submodule 'fulladder' with designated input and output ports: 'a', 'b', and 'cin' as input ports, which are register-type internal signals representing the two binary digits and the carry-in for the addition process respectively; 'cout' and 's' as output ports, which are wire-type internal signals, tracing the carry-out and the sum produced by the full adder. Within the module, the initial block defines a sequence starting with inputs set to zero, then systematically iterating through all possible combinations of the inputs over time, with each combination held for a duration of 10 time units. This setup ensures each potential operation of the full adder is tested, allowing for the verification of the correct sum and carry-out outputs in response to the input conditions.
