The 'fulladdertest' module tests a full adder by sequentially applying all possible input combinations to the 'fulladder' submodule, ensuring accurate sum and carry-out results. It achieves this through an initial block that manipulates register inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin' across the various binary combinations, holding each for 10 time units, while the outputs 'cout' and 's' are monitored as wires to verify operation correctness.
