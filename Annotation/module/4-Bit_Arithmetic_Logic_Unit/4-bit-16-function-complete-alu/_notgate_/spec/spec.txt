Module name: notgate. Module specification: The 'notgate' module is a simple digital logic circuit designed in Verilog that inverts each bit of two 4-bit input vectors. The module takes two inputs, A and B, each comprising a 4-bit vector. It applies a bitwise NOT operation to each bit of these inputs, resulting in two 4-bit output vectors, Abar and Bbar. Specifically, Abar is the bitwise inverse of input A, and Bbar is the bitwise inverse of input B. The module does not use any internal signals as it directly connects outputs to the NOT gates' outputs corresponding to each bit of the inputs. The module is divided into sections where each bit of the input vectors A and B is individually passed through a NOT gate, the output of which is assigned to the respective bit in the output vectors Abar and Bbar. This direct transformation ensures minimal delay in bit inversion, making the module efficient for operations requiring bitwise negation of binary inputs.
