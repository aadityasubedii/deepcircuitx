The result of the NOT operations are output as two 4-bit binary outputs (Abar and Bbar), where Abar is the bitwise NOT of input A, and Bbar is the bitwise NOT of input B.

Each bit of the input vectors A and B is connected to the corresponding bit of the output vectors Abar and Bbar through NOT gates.
