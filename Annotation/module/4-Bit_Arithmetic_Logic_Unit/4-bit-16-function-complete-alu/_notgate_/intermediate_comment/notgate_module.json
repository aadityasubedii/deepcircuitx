    "module": "The 'notgate' module performs bitwise negation on two 4-bit input vectors, A and B, producing outputs Abar and Bbar respectively. Each bit of A and B is directly connected to a NOT gate, where the output of these gates forms the corresponding bits in Abar and Bbar, effectively inverting each bit of the input vectors without any intermediate storage or signals."
