For each bit in `A`, it computes the previous binary value and outputs the result to `Da`. The module uses XOR gates to toggle bits and AND gates along with OR gates to arrange carry propagation for binary subtraction, effectively implementing a decrement by 1. Each output bit in `Da` depends on the corresponding calculations and the output becomes valid only if enabled by `E`."
