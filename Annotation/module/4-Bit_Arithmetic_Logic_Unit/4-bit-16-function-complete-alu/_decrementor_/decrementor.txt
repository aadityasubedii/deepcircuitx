The decrementor module performs a bitwise decrement on a 4-bit input 'A' when enabled by an input 'E', resulting in a 4-bit output 'Da'. Utilizing internal bitwise operations with 20-bit wires, the implementation follows an XOR gate for bit toggle, AND gates for carry generation, and OR gates for carry propagation across bits, ensuring 'Da' reflects decremented 'A' only if 'E' is high.
