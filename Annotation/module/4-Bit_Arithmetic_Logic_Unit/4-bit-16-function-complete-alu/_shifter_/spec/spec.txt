Module name: shiftermod. Module specification: The `shiftermod` is a Verilog module designed to perform conditional bit manipulation on a 4-bit input vector `A`, under the control of signals `C` (control signal for shifting pattern) and `E` (enable signal). The module accepts three input ports: a 4-bit vector `A` which contains the data to be manipulated, `C` which is a control signal that determines the pattern in which the bits of `A` are shifted or altered, and `E` which is an enable signal that allows the module output `S` to reflect the computed results when high; if low, the output does not reflect the changes. The output of the module is a 4-bit vector `S`, where each bit is determined by a series of logical operations - ANDs, ORs, and NOTs - using the inputs and internal signals. Internally, the module uses a 9-bit wire vector `w` to store intermediate values generated from the bit-wise operations on `A` and `C`. Another internal wire `Cbar` holds the negated value of `C`, to assist in conditions where inverse logic is needed. The internal logic includes generating intermediate values on `w` by applying various logical gates like NOT, AND, and OR between `A`, `C`, and `Cbar`. The output bits in `S` are then individually determined by ANDing the relevant intermediate wire values from `w` with the `E` signal, allowing output control based on the enable signal.
