    "module": "The 'oddeven' module calculates the odd or even parity for two 4-bit inputs `a` and `b`, outputting the results `ansA` and `ansB` based on an enable signal `E`. It employs XOR operations sequentially performed on the bits of each input to figure out the parity and gates the resulting parity using an AND operation with the enable signal `E` to conditionally present the output.\n"
