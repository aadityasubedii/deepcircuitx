    "spec": "Module name: oddeven. \nModule specification: The 'oddeven' module is designed to compute the odd or even parity of two 4-bit inputs, named `a` and `b`, based on XOR operations and output the results conditioned by an enable signal `E`. The module features three input ports: `a` and `b` (4-bit each), which serve as the two inputs for which the parity is calculated, and `E`, an enable signal which controls if the computed parity results are outputted. There are two output ports, `ansA` and `ansB`, which provide the parity results of `a` and `b`, respectively. These outputs are enabled only when `E` is high, ensuring the result visibility is conditional based on the enable signal. Internal signals include a 4-bit wire `w` and two wires `wireAnsA` and `wireAnsB`. The wire `w` is used in sequential XOR operations to compute the parity: `w[0]` and `w[2]` for initial XOR operations of `a` and `b`, and `w[1]` and `w[3]` for subsequent XOR stages. The results `wireAnsA` and `wireAnsB` hold intermediate parity values of `a` and `b`, which are then gated with `E` to produce the final outputs `ansA` and `ansB'. The code is structured into two main blocks: one for calculating the parity of `a` and the other for `b`, each employing a series of XOR operations, followed by an AND operation that gates the computed parity with the enable signal to form the outputs. This organization ensures clarity in design and operational efficiency in producing the conditioned outputs based on the parity computations.",
