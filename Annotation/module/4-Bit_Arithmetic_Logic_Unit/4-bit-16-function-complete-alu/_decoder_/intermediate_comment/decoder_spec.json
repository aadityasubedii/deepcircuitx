    "spec": "Module name: decoder. Module specification: The \"decoder\" module is designed to implement a 4-to-16 line binary decoder using Verilog. This decoder receives four binary input signals labeled A, B, C, and D. These inputs are individually capable of being either a logic 0 or 1, and their combination uniquely determines which one of the sixteen outputs is set to high (1). The output ports are bundled into a 16-bit vector E[15:0], where each bit in the vector corresponds to one of the sixteen possible output lines. Only one output in this vector is active at a time, creating a \"one-hot\" encoding scheme that maps each 4-bit input combination to a unique output line. Internally, the module utilizes four signals, Abar, Bbar, Cbar, and Dbar, which are generated by inverting the input signals A, B, C, and D respectively. These inversions are crucial as they are used along with the original inputs in a series of AND gates to generate all possible combinations of inputs and their inverted counterparts. Each AND gate generates one bit of the output vector, thereby ensuring only the correct output is activated based on the input combination. The design uses NOT gates for inversion and AND gates to form each specific output bit, effectively decoding the binary input into a distinct binary output line in the form of a one-hot code.",
