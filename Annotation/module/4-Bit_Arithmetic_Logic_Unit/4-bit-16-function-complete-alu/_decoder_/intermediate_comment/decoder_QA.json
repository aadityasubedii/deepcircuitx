Each bit of the output vector is derived from a unique combination of the input signals. This is achieved using NOT gates to invert each input and AND gates to combine the original and inverted inputs in all possible ways. The design effectively implements a 4-to-16 line binary decoder, where every possible input combination produces a unique binary output on the 16 output lines, with exactly one output line going high (logical 1) for each input combination."

The combination of these four inputs determines which one of the sixteen outputs will be set to high (1).\n\nOutput ports: E[15:0].\nExplanation: This is a 16-bit vector output where each bit (from E[0] to E[15]) represents one of the sixteen possible output lines of the decoder. For each unique combination of inputs A, B, C, and D, exactly one output in this vector will be high, corresponding to the binary value of the inputs. This enables the module to decode the binary input value into a \"one-hot\" output code, where only one output is active at a time."

Each internal signal (Abar, Bbar, Cbar, Dbar) is generated by applying a NOT operation to its corresponding input signal. The role of these internal signals is crucial in creating the 16 unique combinations required for the decoder's functionality. By using both original and inverted forms of each input, the module is able to generate all possible combinations through the AND gates, which in turn drives the appropriate output high for each different input scenario."
