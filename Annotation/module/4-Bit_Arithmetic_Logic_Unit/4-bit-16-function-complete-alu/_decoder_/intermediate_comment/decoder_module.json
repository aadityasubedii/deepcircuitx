    "module": "The decoder module is a 4-to-16 line binary decoder that takes four binary inputs (A, B, C, D) and produces a 16-bit one-hot output vector (E). It uses NOT gates to invert each input generating signals (Abar, Bbar, Cbar, Dbar), and sixteen AND gates to combine every possible combination of the original and inverted inputs to determine the active output line in the output vector."
