    "module": "The 'norgate' module performs a bitwise NOR operation on two 4-bit input vectors 'a' and 'b', outputting the result as a 4-bit vector 'is'. Each bit of the output 'is' is generated by applying a NOR gate to the corresponding bits of 'a' and 'b', directly producing the output without the use of internal signals. This straightforward implementation efficiently maps the inputs to the output through individual bitwise operations."
