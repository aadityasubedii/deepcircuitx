Module name: norgate. Module specification: The 'norgate' module is designed to compute the bitwise NOR of two 4-bit input vectors 'a' and 'b', outputting the result as a 4-bit vector 'is'. The input ports, 'a' and 'b', each consist of 4-bit vectors where each bit is fed into its respective NOR operation with the corresponding bit from the other vector. The output port, 'is', directly outputs the results of these NOR operations, providing a 4-bit vector where each bit is the NOR of the corresponding bits of 'a' and 'b'. This module does not use any internal signals and is straightforward in its operation, directly connecting the input bits to their corresponding NOR gates and outputting the results with minimal internal processing. The code is structured into definitional blocks including port definitions and assignments, where each NOR operation is explicitly carried out for the individual bits of the input vectors, directly determining the values of the output vector 'is'.
