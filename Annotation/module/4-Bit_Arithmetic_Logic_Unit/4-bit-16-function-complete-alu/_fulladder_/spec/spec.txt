Module name: fulladder.
Module specification: The 'fulladder' module is designed to perform a 4-bit full addition of two binary numbers. It accepts two 4-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', and an enable signal 'E'. Based on the state of 'E', the module outputs a 4-bit sum 's' and a carry out 'cout'. When 'E' is high, the computation proceeds, otherwise, 's' outputs zero. The internal design involves intermediate wires and logic to handle bit-wise operations and carry propagation. The module uses wires 'w[1:12]' for temporary logical results, such as XOR and AND operations necessary for addition and carry generation. Wires 'c1', 'c2', and 'c3' serve as carry bits between different stages. The outputs 's0', 's1', 's2', 's3' are initial sum results for each bit, which are then ANDed with 'E' to control the final output based on the enable signal. The module first processes each pair of bits from 'a' and 'b' through XOR operations to compute initial sums and determine carry-ins using AND operations. It then combines these individual results using OR gates to form carry for the next higher bit. Finally, the sum for each bit is gated by the enable signal 'E' to produce the final output. This structured approach ensures that the addition respects binary addition rules including bit-wise operations and carry handling.
