The 'fulladder' module performs a 4-bit addition of two binary numbers, controlled by an enable signal 'E'. It calculates the sum and carry-out using bit-wise XOR for initial sums, AND for intermediate carry generation, and OR gates to produce final carry between stages. The result is gated by 'E', producing an output sum that is conditional.
