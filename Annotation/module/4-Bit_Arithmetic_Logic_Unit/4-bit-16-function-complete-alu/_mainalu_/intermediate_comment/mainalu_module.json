    "module": "The mainalu module is a multifunctional arithmetic logic unit (ALU) designed to perform a variety of arithmetic and logic operations. It processes inputs through sub-modules like andgatemod, norgatemod, and others, each enabled by specific conditions derived from its primary single-bit and 4-bit inputs. These conditions are set using internal complements and boolean operations on the inputs, facilitating dynamic and versatile computation capabilities across numerous outputs."
