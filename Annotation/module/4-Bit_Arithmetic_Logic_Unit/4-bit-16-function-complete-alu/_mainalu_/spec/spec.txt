Module name: **mainalu**

Module specification: The **mainalu** module is a multi-functional arithmetic logic unit (ALU) designed to handle a variety of arithmetic and logical operations based on its inputs. It accepts four single-bit inputs `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, two 4-bit inputs `a`, `b`, and a single-bit input `shiftCon`. The module outputs a 16-bit enable signal array `E`, alongside multiple operation-specific outputs including `andOut`, `norOut`, `nandOut`, `orOut`, `xorOut`, `AbarOut`, `BbarOut`, `adderOut`, `Cout`, `Bout`, `subtractOut`, `compGOut`, `compEOut`, `compLOut`, `multiOut`, `evenAOut`, `evenBOut`, `oddAOut`, `oddBOut`, `decremOut`, `incremOut`, `xnorOut`, and `shiftOut`. Internal signals `Abar`, `Bbar`, `Cbar`, and `Dbar` are created as complements of `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` respectively, using NOT gates, which support the generation of the 16-bit enable signals `E` through combinations of these inputs and their complements. This array `E` is pivotal as each bit activates specific operations inside the module's numerous sub-modules, such as `andgatemod`, `norgatemod`, `nandgatemod`, `orgatemod`, `xorgatemod`, `notgatemod`, and others. Each of these sub-modules processes bits from `a` and `b` based on the relevant logic operation and enabled condition, and contributes to the final outputs. Adder, subtractor, comparator, and shifter sub-modules handle other arithmetic and comparison-based operations using `a`, `b`, and `shiftCon`, and deliver results to their respective output ports. This intricate design allows **mainalu** to perform a wide range of computational tasks, making it versatile and dynamic in operation, which is determined by multiple internal and external conditions.
