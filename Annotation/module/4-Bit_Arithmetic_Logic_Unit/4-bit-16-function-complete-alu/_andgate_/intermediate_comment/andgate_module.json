    "module": "The \"andmod\" module performs a bitwise AND operation on two 4-bit input vectors `a` and `b`, outputting the result in a 4-bit vector `ab`. Each bit of `ab` is computed by ANDing the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` directly, facilitated by individual AND gates for each bit, making the implementation both straightforward and efficient."
