Module name: andmod. Module specification: The "andmod" is a digital logic module in Verilog designed to perform a bitwise AND operation on two 4-bit input vectors, named `a` and `b`. The results of this operation are outputted as a 4-bit vector `ab`. Each bit in this vector `ab` is determined by the AND operation of the corresponding bits from `a` and `b`. Specifically, `ab[0]` is derived from `a[0]` AND `b[0]`, continuing in the same pattern up to `ab[3]`, which is derived from `a[3]` AND `b[3]`. The module defines two input ports (`a` and `b`) and one output port (`ab`). The inputs, `a` and `b`, serve as operands for the AND operations, and the output `ab` stores the result of these operations. There are no explicitly defined internal signals within the module; the functionality is achieved directly through the application of Boolean AND gates specified in four separate lines, each pertaining to one bit of the result vector. This simple and direct structural approach ensures clarity and efficiency in the execution of bitwise AND operations.
