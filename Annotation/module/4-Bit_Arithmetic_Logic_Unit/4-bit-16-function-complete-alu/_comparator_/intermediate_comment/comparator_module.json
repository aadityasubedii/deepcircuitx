    "module": "The comparator module compares two 4-bit inputs, A and B, and determines if A is greater than, equal to, or less than B based on an enable signal En. It uses bitwise NOT, XOR, AND, and OR operations across internal wires to evaluate the comparison, outputting the results as G (greater), E (equal), and L (less) when enabled."
