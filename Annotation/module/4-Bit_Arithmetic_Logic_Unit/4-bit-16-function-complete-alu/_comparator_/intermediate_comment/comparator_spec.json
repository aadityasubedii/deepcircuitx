    "spec": "Module name: comparator. Module specification: The comparator module is designed to compare two 4-bit binary values, A and B, based on an enabled signal 'En'. When enabled, the module determines if A is greater than (G), equal to (E), or less than (L) B, and outputs these results through G, E, and L respectively. Input ports include [3:0]A and [3:0]B for the binary values to compare, and En as an enable signal. Output ports are G, E, and L indicating the result of the comparison. Internally, the module utilizes a series of 33 intermediate wire signals (w[0] to w[32]) to handle various logical operations. w[0] to w[3] store XOR results between corresponding bits of A and B to identify differences. Flows such as w[4] to w[6] and w[20] to w[32] involve complex combinations of AND and OR operations connected to produce the final outputs after checking for conditions equivalent to A being greater, equal, or less thanks to Abar and Bbar. Abar and Bbar are 4-bit wires holding bitwise NOT of A and B, respectively, used in logical checks against conditions confirming if A is greater or less than B. The module thus elegantly encapsulates the comparative logic through hierarchical usage of digital gates structured to optimize the decision-making process under the governing enable signal.",
