It evaluates whether A is greater than (G), less than (L), or equal to (E) B, with these results being enabled by an input signal En. The outputs (G, E, L) indicate greater, equal, and less respectively, depending on the comparison. The module utilizes bitwise NOT and XOR operations to analyze the differences between corresponding bits of A and B, intermediate AND operations to process various conditions, and OR operations to compile the final outputs for each comparison."

These signals help in computing whether A is greater than, less than, or equal to B. Specifically, they store results of XOR operations between corresponding bits of A and B to find differences, intermediate AND operations to determine when combined bit conditions agree with a hypothesis (equal, greater, or less), and OR operations to consolidate these intermediate results into final outputs.\n- `Abar`: This is a 4-bit wide wire vector that holds the bitwise NOT values of input A. This means each bit in Abar is the logical negation of the corresponding bit in A. This negated version of A is used in certain logical conditions required to determine if A is less than B.\n- `Bbar`: Similar to Abar, this is a 4-bit wide wire vector that holds the bitwise NOT values of input B.
