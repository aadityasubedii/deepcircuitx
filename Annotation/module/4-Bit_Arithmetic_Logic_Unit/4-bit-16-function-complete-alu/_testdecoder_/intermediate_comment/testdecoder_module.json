    "module": "The 'testdecoder' module simulates a decoder's function to map four binary inputs (A, B, C, D) into a 16-bit one-hot output (E), verifying the decoder's performance. It initializes inputs to zero and manipulates them sequentially to observe the output changes, incorporating a 'decoder' submodule to perform the actual decoding logic, facilitating comprehensive testing through practical input scenarios."
