    "spec": "Module name: testdecoder. \nModule specification: The 'testdecoder' module is structured to test the functionality of a decoder submodule, effectively simulating its ability to convert four binary inputs to a one-hot encoded 16-bit output. The input ports include A, B, C, and D, each a single-bit register that sequences the binary inputs for the decoder. The primary output port is E, a 16-bit wire showcasing the decoder's output based on inputs A, B, C, and D. Internal signals mirror these input and output ports. The module's code is divided into initialization and simulation sections. In the initial block, inputs A, B, C, and D are all set to 0, followed by a temporal change in input A to model and evaluate the decoder's response. Subsequent manipulations or tests can be appended in further simulation cycles to thoroughly assess all decoder operational states based on various input combinations, though these are not included in the provided code snippet. This structured testbench ensures comprehensive verification of the decoder\u2019s conversion logic in a controlled test environment.",
