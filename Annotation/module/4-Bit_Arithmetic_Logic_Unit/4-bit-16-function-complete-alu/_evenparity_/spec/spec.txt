Module name: evenparity.
Module specification: The 'evenparity' module is designed to compute the even parity for two separate 4-bit input vectors named 'a' and 'b'. This computation is controlled by an enable signal 'E'. The module has three input ports: 'a' and 'b', which are the 4-bit vectors for parity calculation, and 'E', a single bit that enables the output parity bits, 'ansA' and 'ansB'. These outputs are single-bit signals representing the even parity of vectors 'a' and 'b,' respectively. The outputs are active (reflect the computed parity) when 'E' is high; otherwise, they are low, indicating the outputs are disabled. Internally, the module utilizes a four-bit wire array 'w' for intermediate steps in the parity computation. 'w[0]' and 'w[2]' store the first level of XOR results for inputs 'a' and 'b', respectively, while 'w[1]' and 'w[3]' store the second level of XOR results that lead to the final parity bits 'wireAnsA' and 'wireAnsB'. These final computed parities are then ANDed with the enable signal 'E' to generate the ultimate output signals 'ansA' and 'ansB'. The code is thus organized into blocks handling the XOR operations for each input vector followed by the AND operations linking the computed parities with the enable signal.
