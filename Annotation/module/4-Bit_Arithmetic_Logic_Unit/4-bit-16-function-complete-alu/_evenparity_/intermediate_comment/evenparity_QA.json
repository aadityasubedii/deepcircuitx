The module uses XOR gates to find the parity of each input vector, producing a single bit output for each vector (wireAnsA and wireAnsB). The results are then ANDed with an enable signal 'E', to produce the final outputs 'ansA' and 'ansB'. This indicates that the output parity bits are only valid when 'E' is high; otherwise, the outputs will be low regardless of the input vectors' parity."
