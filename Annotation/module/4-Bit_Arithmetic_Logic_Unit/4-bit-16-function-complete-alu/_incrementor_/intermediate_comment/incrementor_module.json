    "module": "The `incrementor` module increments a 4-bit number `A` by 1 when enabled by signal `E`. It uses bitwise XOR and AND gates across 4 stages linked by intermediary 8-bit wire `w` to calculate the incremented value and the carry propagation, then gates the final result `Ia` through the enable signal `E` to ensure operation only when enabled."
