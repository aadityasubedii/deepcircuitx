The module utilizes a series of bitwise XOR and AND operations to perform binary addition with carry logic for each bit of `A`.

This essentially calculates the sum of 'A[0] and 1', addressing the first bit incrementation.\n- `w[1]`: Stores the result of the AND operation between `A[0]` and 1, effectively determining the carry-out from the first bit's addition and is used to calculate the carry for the next bit.\n- `w[2]`: Uses the value in `w[1]` (previous carry) and performs an XOR operation with `A[1]` to manage the addition and propagation of carry for the second bit.\n- `w[3]`: Determines the carry-out from the addition occurring at the second bit (`A[1]` with the prior carry-in `w[1]`) and feeds this as the carry-in for the third bit.\n- `w[4]`: This is similar to `w[2]` but for the third bit (`A[2]`), using the carry from the second bit (`w[3]`).\n- `w[5]`: Handles the carry-out from the third bit to be used as the carry-in for the fourth bit.\n- `w[6]`: Manages the XOR operation for the fourth bit (`A[3]`), taking into account the carry from the third bit (`w[5]`).\n- `w[7]`: Calculates the carry-out from the fourth bit, although in this specific modulo configuration, it doesn't connect to any further bit.\n\nThese internal signals aid in processing each bit of `A` for the increment operation with the appropriate carry handling, allowing for a correct and efficient binary addition.
