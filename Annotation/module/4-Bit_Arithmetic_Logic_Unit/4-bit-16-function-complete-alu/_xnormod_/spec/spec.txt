Module name: xnormod. 
Module specification: The 'xnormod' module in Verilog is designed for conditional similarity testing between two 4-bit inputs, 'a' and 'b'. It outputs a 4-bit result 'ans', driven by an additional single-bit input 'E' that serves as an enable signal. The module operates by first performing a bit-wise XNOR operation between corresponding bits of 'a' and 'b', storing the intermediate 4-bit results in the internal signal 'w'. Each bit of 'w' represents the similarity between the respective bits of 'a' and 'b'. These XNOR results are then conditioned by the input 'E' through a series of AND gates; if 'E' is high, the output 'ans' mirrors 'w', otherwise 'ans' is cleared to zeros. This setup allows 'ans' to represent the bit-wise similarity between 'a' and 'b' only when enabled by 'E'. The code is well segmented into operations: first, the XNOR calculations store results in 'w', and subsequent AND operations determine the final output based on the enable signal. This module is particularly useful for scenarios where similarity needs to be validated conditionally.
