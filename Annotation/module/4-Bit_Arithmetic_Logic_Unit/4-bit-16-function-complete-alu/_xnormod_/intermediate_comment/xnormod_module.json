    "module": "The 'xnormod' module performs a conditional similarity check between two 4-bit vectors 'a' and 'b', outputting the result based on an enable signal 'E'. It utilizes bit-wise XNOR operations to compare each pair of bits from 'a' and 'b', storing these interim results in an internal 4-bit wire 'w'. The final output 'ans' is determined by ANDing each bit of 'w' with 'E', such that 'ans' reflects similarity only if 'E' is high, otherwise all bits of 'ans' are low."
