Module name: RegB. Module specification: The RegB module controls a 4-bit register, 'W', and outputs its value through output 'B'. The input ports include a 4-bit switch 'sw', and two buttons 'btnC' (button C) and 'btnL' (button L). The 'sw' provides the new value for 'W' when 'btnL' is pressed, assuming 'btnC' is not pressed. 'btnC' resets 'W' to zero when activated, while 'btnL' enables updating 'W' from 'sw' if 'btnC' is inactive. The sole output port, 'B', outputs the current value of 'W', effectively mirroring it. Internally, the module uses the register 'W' to store and manipulate the value based on the button inputs. The module utilizes two main code blocks: an 'assign' statement which continuously assigns the value of 'W' to 'B', and a procedural block triggered by changes to 'btnC' or 'btnL'. This procedural block decides whether 'W' should be reset, updated from 'sw', or retain its value based on the states of 'btnC' and 'btnL'. This setup allows 'W' to dynamically reflect user inputs through the use of the buttons, making the RegB module a responsive and interactive component in digital systems.
