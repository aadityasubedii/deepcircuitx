The RegB module controls a 4-bit register 'W', reflecting its value on the output 'B', based on control inputs from two buttons, 'btnC' and 'btnL'. 'btnC' resets 'W' to zero, while 'btnL' updates 'W' from 'sw' unless 'btnC' is pressed. This behavior is implemented using conditional logic in an always block, triggered by changes to 'btnC' or 'btnL', and an assignment that directly maps 'W' to 'B'.
