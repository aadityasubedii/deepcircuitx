    "module": "The `RegY` module functions as a buffer that captures and temporarily stores a 4-bit input `ALU`, and outputs this value through the `RegY` port. It employs a 4-bit internal register `W` that is updated with the `ALU` value on any change, ensuring the output `RegY` reflects the current value of `W` via an `assign` statement, making the data available externally as needed."
