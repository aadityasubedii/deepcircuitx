    "spec": "Module name: RegY. Module specification: The `RegY` module is designed to act as a storage element or buffer in Verilog, primarily dealing with a 4-bit data path. It accepts a 4-bit input named `ALU`, which is essential for temporarily holding data that needs to be stored inside the module. This data is stored in an internal 4-bit register named `W`. Whenever there is any change in the `ALU` input, `W` is updated with the new value, thanks to the always block that triggers on changes to `ALU`. The value stored in `W` is then consistently output through a 4-bit output port `RegY`. This output facilitates the external utilization of the data stored by the module, effectively making `RegY` serve as an output buffer. The Verilog code is organized into declarative blocks where `W` is declared as a register, and procedural blocks facilitated by an always block for dynamic data handling based on the input signal's status. Additionally, an assign statement connects the internal register `W` to the output `RegY`, ensuring that the output always mirrors the stored data.",
