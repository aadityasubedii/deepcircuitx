Module specification: The `RegA` module serves as a register controller designed primarily to manipulate a 4-bit value stored within a register `Z` based on inputs from switches (`sw`) and buttons (`btnC` for Clear and `btnU` for Update). The input ports of the module include a 4-bit `sw`, which serves as the data source for potential new values of `Z`, and the buttons `btnC` and `btnU`, which control the reset and updating of `Z` respectively. When `btnC` is asserted (logic low), it resets `Z` to 0, regardless of other signals. In contrast, `btnU` loads the current value from `sw` into `Z` when asserted (logic high), and `btnC` is not asserted. The output port `A` directly reflects the current value of `Z` for external interfacing. Internally, the register `Z` is central in holding and possibly modifying data based on the inputs. The code has structured blocks, particularly within the always block reacting to button presses (`btnC` or `btnU`), containing conditional statements that determine the logic for resetting or updating `Z` according to the inputs provided, showcasing distinct paths for holding the value, updating with new data from `sw`, or resetting to 0. This module's versatility makes it suitable for applications requiring controlled manipulations of register values driven by user inputs.",
