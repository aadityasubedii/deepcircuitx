The module stores a 4-bit value in register `Z`. The value of `Z` can be altered based on the states of `btnC` (Clear) and `btnU` (Update). If both buttons are not pressed (`btnC == 0 && btnU == 0`), `Z` retains its current value. If `btnU` is pressed while `btnC` is not (`btnC == 0 && btnU == 1`), `Z` adopts the value from the switches `sw`. If `btnC` is pressed (regardless of the state of `btnU`), `Z` is reset to 4'b0000. The output `A` directly mirrors the state of `Z`. This functionality allows for controlled modification and resetting of the register based on external inputs."
