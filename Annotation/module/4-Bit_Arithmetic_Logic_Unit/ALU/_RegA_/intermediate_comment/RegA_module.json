    "module": "The `RegA` module is designed to control a 4-bit register `Z` based on inputs from switches (`sw`) and buttons (`btnC` for clear, `btnU` for update). The module updates `Z` with data from `sw` when `btnU` is active and `btnC` is inactive, resets `Z` to zero when `btnC` is active, and keeps `Z` unchanged when both buttons are inactive. The output `A` mirrors the current state of `Z`, ensuring external systems can monitor or utilize the stored value. This functionality allows dynamic and controlled updating or clearing of the register based on user input."
