The ALU module performs arithmetic and logical operations on two 4-bit inputs 'A' and 'B' determined by a 2-bit selector 'Sel'. It achieves this through a case statement in an always block, reacting to changes in A, B, or Sel, computing the desired operation, and storing the result in a register 'H'. The output 'Y' then reflects the value stored in 'H'.
