    "spec": "Module name: ALU. Module specification: The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is a Verilog module designed to perform various arithmetic and logical operations on two 4-bit inputs based on a 2-bit selector input. The module takes three inputs: 'A' and 'B', which are both 4-bit operands used for the operations, and 'Sel', a 2-bit selector that determines the specific operation to be performed (00 for addition, 01 for subtraction, 10 for bitwise OR, and 11 for bitwise AND). The result of the operation is stored in a 4-bit internal register 'H' and then output through the 4-bit output port 'Y'. The code features an 'always' block that is sensitive to changes in 'A', 'B', or 'Sel'. This block contains a 'case' statement to handle the selection and execution of the appropriate operation based on the value of 'Sel'. Each case within the 'case' statement corresponds to one of the operations, directing 'H' to store the result, which is subsequently assigned to 'Y'. The use of a register 'H' ensures that the result of the last computed operation remains stable and is effectively outputted through 'Y' until a change in inputs triggers a new operation.",
