Module name: TopMod. 
Module specification: The 'TopMod' module is a digital processing system designed to interface with user inputs via switches and buttons, and signals its status through LEDs. Specifically, it includes inputs [sw, btnU, btnL, btnC] where 'sw' is an 8-bit switch consisting of control and data signals. The top four bits (sw[7:4]) are data for registers, the middle two bits (sw[3:2]) specify ALU operations, and the lower two (sw[1:0]) select LED outputs. The buttons 'btnU', 'btnL', and 'btnC' serve as control inputs affecting registers and synchronization. The output [led] is a 4-bit connection to LEDs, showing processing results based on user inputs and operation settings. Internally, the module utilizes signals [A, B, Y] for data handling, where 'A' and 'B' come from registers RegA and RegB respectively - both fed by sw[7:4] and controlled by btnC along with btnU for 'A' and btnL for 'B'. 'Y' is an ALU output based on 'A' and 'B', determined by sw[3:2]. The module comprises sub-modules: RegA for processing 'A', RegB for 'B', ALU for computing 'Y', and Multiplexer1, which selects outputs to 'led' based on sw[1:0] and the values from 'A', 'B', and 'Y'. These components interact to form a functional unit that displays the computed results directly on LEDs, allowing for real-time feedback based on the provided controls and computations.
