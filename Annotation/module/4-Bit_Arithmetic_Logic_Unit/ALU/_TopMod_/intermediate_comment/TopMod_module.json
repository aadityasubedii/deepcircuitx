    "module": "The TopMod module processes user inputs via switches and buttons to control outputs on LEDs, reflecting the computational results. It incorporates registers RegA and RegB, controlled by buttons and portions of the switch inputs, an ALU for arithmetic operations determined by switch settings, and a multiplexer which routes the computed values from registers and ALU to the LEDs based on further switch inputs. This setup allows dynamic control and display of processing results in real-time."
