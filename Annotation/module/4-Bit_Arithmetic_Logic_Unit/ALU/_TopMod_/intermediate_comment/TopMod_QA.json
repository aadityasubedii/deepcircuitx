The inputs are processed by two registers (RegA and RegB) and an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit). Register RegA takes upper half (4 bits) of `sw` and depending on `btnC` and `btnU`, outputs to `A`. Similarly, register RegB takes the same input bits from `sw` but operates based on `btnC` and `btnL`, outputting to `B`. The ALU performs an operation on `A` and `B` specified by middle bits of `sw`, outputting to `Y`. Finally, a multiplexer (Multiplexer1) decides the final output to the LEDs based on the lower two bits of `sw` and values from `A`, `B`, and `Y`. This setup suggests a flexible system where user input directly influences data handling and processing, showing results via LED indicators."
