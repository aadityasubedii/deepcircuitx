    "module": "The Multiplexer module is designed to select and output one of several inputs based on a 2-bit control signal `selMUX`. Currently, the module includes definitions for input and output ports but lacks the implementation of the internal logic needed for selecting and outputting the desired input signaled by `selMUX`. This setup outlines the structural framework, requiring further development to perform its intended functionality."
