However, the functionality of the multiplexer, such as selecting one of multiple input lines based on the `selMUX` value, isn't implemented within the visible code snippet.

In multiplexer operations, this input typically acts as the control signal to determine the output based on the internal logic, which is not implemented in the given code snippet.]\n\nOutput ports: [M]. Explanation: [The `M` output is a 4-bit vector which is meant to display the selected input based on the control signals provided by `selMUX`. In a fully implemented multiplexer module, `M` would present the outcome of the multiplexing operation, showing which input has been selected and transferred to the output, dependent on the value of `selMUX`.
