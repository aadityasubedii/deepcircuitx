Module name: Multiplexer. Module specification: The Multiplexer module is designed to select one of multiple input lines based on control signals for output. In the provided code snippet, the module is defined with an input vector `selMUX` which is 2 bits wide, typically used as a control signal to determine the output line from multiple inputs, although, the specific multiplexing logic is not implemented in this snippet. The output vector `M` is 4 bits wide and meant to display the selected input guided by the `selMUX` inputs. However, due to the lack of internal logic and connections within this code snippet, the output `M` does not currently represent any functional behavior. The module does not utilize any internal signals as the key logic and connections are absent in the provided snippet. The code primarily establishes the module structure with defined input and output ports but does not include any functional blocks or sections implementing the multiplexing operation. The overall specification reveals a structural framework awaiting the addition of internal multiplexing logic for functional deployment.
