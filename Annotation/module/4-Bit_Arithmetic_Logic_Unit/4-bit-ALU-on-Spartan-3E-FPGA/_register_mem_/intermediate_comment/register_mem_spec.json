    "spec": "Module name: register_mem. Module specification: The 'register_mem' module is a 4-bit synchronous register with clear and load functionalities, designed to operate on the rising edge of the clock signal ('clk'). The module has three input ports: 'clk' is the clock input that synchronizes the operations, 'clr' is a clear signal that when high, resets the output 'D_out' to 0, and 'ld' is a load signal that enables the data from the 4-bit input port 'D_in' to be loaded into 'D_out' when high, provided 'clr' is not asserting. The output of the module is 'D_out', a 4-bit register that holds the data. Internally, 'D_out' is declared as an \"output reg [3:0]\", suggesting its dual role as both an output and a storage element. The module's behavior is controlled by an always block that triggers on the positive edge of 'clk'. Within this block, clear operation takes precedence over load operation; if 'clr' is asserted, 'D_out' is cleared to 0; otherwise, if 'ld' is asserted, 'D_out' captures and holds the value from 'D_in'. This structure ensures data integrity and responsiveness to control signals on each clock cycle.",
