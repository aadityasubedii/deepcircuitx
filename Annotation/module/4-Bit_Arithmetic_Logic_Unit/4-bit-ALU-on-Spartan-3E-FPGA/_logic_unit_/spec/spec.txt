Module name: logic_unit. 
Module specification: The "logic_unit" module is designed for performing a variety of arithmetic and logical functions determined by operational codes on input data. It manages the operations based on inputs from three buttons - but_A, but_B, and but_op - which allow the user to set operand values for A and B and choose the operation respectively. The input ports include "clk" (clock signal for timing-sensitive actions), "clr_common" (a reset signal that zeroes the output register O when active), “but_A”, “but_B”, “but_op” (buttons used to load values or operation code), and a 4-bit "data" input (value loaded based on button pressed). The module outputs through an 8-bit register "O", which displays the result of the selected operation. Internally, the module uses wire-type signals "out1", "out2", "out3" (carrying data from inputs to registers), and registers "A", "B", "opcode" (storing operand values and the chosen mathematical operation). Detailed operational logic is encapsulated within two main blocks: an always block for assigning register values from outputs of peripheral "register_mem" instances for A, B, and opcodes based on button presses, and a sequential always block (triggered on the positive edge of clk) which computes the output based on the operation code, including operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, AND, OR, XOR, and XNOR, with a default case producing a specific value when no valid operation code is present. This structured approach efficiently categorizes functionality, ensuring clarity and manageability in executing complex logical operations.
