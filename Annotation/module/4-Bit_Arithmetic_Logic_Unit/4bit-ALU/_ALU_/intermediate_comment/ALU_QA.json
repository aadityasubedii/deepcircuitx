            "content": "Name of the module and its functionality is as follows: \n1. **Module name:** full_adder\n   - **Explanation:** This module performs a single-bit full addition. It takes two input bits `a` and `b`, and a carry-in `cin`. It outputs the sum bit `s` and a carry-out `cout`. The module uses XOR gates for sum calculation and AND, OR gates to determine the carry-out.\n\n2. **Module name:** ripple_carry_adder\n   - **Explanation:** This module implements a 4-bit ripple carry adder using four instances of the `full_adder` module. It sequentially adds corresponding bits of two 4-bit numbers `a` and `b`, along with a carry bit propagated from the previous addition. The sum output is `s` and the final carry bit is `cout`.\n\n3. **Module name:** twos_complement\n   - **Explanation:** This module computes the two's complement of a 4-bit input `A`. It uses NOT gates to invert the bits of `A`, and adds 1 using the `ripple_carry_adder` to get the two's complement result `Z` and a carry-out `cout`.\n\n4. **Module name:** multiplication\n   - **Explanation:** The module performs a multiplication operation on two 4-bit numbers `a` and `b`. It carries out the multiplication through bit-wise AND operations and multiple stages of additions using `ripple_carry_adder`, producing a 4-bit product `c`.\n\n5. **Module name:** mux_8to_1\n   - **Explanation:** This module is an 8-to-1 multiplexer (`mux`). Based on the 3-bit select input (`s0, s1, s2`), it forwards one of the eight input signals (i0 to i7) to the output `out`.\n\n6. **Module name:** AND\n   - **Explanation:** This simple module performs a bitwise AND operation on two 4-bit inputs `a` and `b`, resulting in a 4-bit output `c`.\n\n7. **Module name:** OR\n   - **Explanation:** This module performs a bitwise OR operation on two 4-bit inputs `a` and `b`, resulting in a 4-bit output `c`.\n\n8. **Module name:** substract\n   - **Explanation:** This module computes the subtraction of two 4-bit numbers `A` and `B` by first getting the two's complement of `B` and then adding it to `A` using the `ripple_carry_adder`. The subtraction result is in `C` and the carry-out in `cout`.\n\n9. **Module name:** XOR\n   - **Explanation:** This module conducts a bitwise XOR operation between two 4-bit numbers `a` and `b`, generating a 4-bit output `c`.\n\n10. **Module name:** ALU\n    - **Explanation:** The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in this module computes different arithmetic and logic operations based on the inputs `a`, `b`, and the select signals `s0, s1, s2`. It includes operations like twos_complement, addition, subtraction, multiplication, AND, OR, and XOR through internal sub-modules and uses multiplexers to select the output.\n\n11. **Module name:** stimulus\n    - **Explanation:** This testbench module initializes inputs and triggers the ALU module to perform operations, displaying the results. It sets the select inputs and operands, then shows the computed results from the ALU module on the console."
