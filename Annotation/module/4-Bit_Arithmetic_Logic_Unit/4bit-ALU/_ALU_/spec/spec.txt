Module name: ripple_carry_adder. Module specification: The "ripple_carry_adder" is a Verilog module designed to perform binary addition on two 4-bit numbers (a and b), producing a 4-bit sum (s) and a carry-out (cout). The module inputs include two 4-bit vectors 'a' and 'b' representing the numbers to be added, and a single-bit input 'cin' acting as the initial carry-in. The primary outputs are the 4-bit sum 's' and the carry-out 'cout'. Internally, the module utilizes three intermediate signals 'carry1', 'carry2', and 'carry3' that act as carry-forward between stages of addition. These carries ensure that the carry generated in one stage of addition is passed on to the next. The module consists of four instantiations of the "full_adder" submodule, each handling one bit of the operands. The first full_adder takes the least significant bits and the initial carry-in, and each subsequent full_adder takes the next significant bit along with the carry from the previous stage. This configuration embodies the ripple-carry addition technique, where the carry output from one full adder is passed as the carry input to the next, effectively "rippling" through the adder chain from the least significant to the most significant bit position. This module is essential in implementing arithmetic operations in larger computational systems, especially those requiring basic arithmetic calculations.
