The "ripple_carry_adder" module performs binary addition on two 4-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', producing a 4-bit sum 's' and a carry-out 'cout'. It achieves this through a chain of four "full_adder" submodules, each handling one bit of the operands. The carry from each addition is passed to the next module, implementing the ripple-carry method where the carry-out of one stage serves as the carry-in for the subsequent stage, cascading from least to most significant bit.
