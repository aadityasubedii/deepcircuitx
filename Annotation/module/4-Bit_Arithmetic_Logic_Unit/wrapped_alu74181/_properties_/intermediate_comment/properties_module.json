    "module": "This module verifies the output signal integrity in various operational states based on the `active` input signal. When active, it asserts that different outputs such as bus signals, IO controls, and interrupt flags, match their predefined buffered versions, ensuring data consistency; conversely, when inactive, it ensures all outputs are deasserted to safe default values, preventing any unintended operations under inactive conditions. The checks are conditionally compiled based on the presence of specific feature flags, allowing customized behavior aligned with the configured functionalities."
