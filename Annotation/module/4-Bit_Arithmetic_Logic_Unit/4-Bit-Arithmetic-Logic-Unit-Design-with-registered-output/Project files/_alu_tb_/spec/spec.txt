Module name: alu_tb.
Module specification: The 'alu_tb' module is a test bench specifically designed for verifying the functionality of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) called 'ALU_DUT'. This test bench generates different test cases by providing random inputs to the ALU for various operations determined by the opcode. The input ports include a clock signal ('clk') for synchronous operations, a reset signal ('rst_n' which is active low) for setting the ALU to initial states, two data inputs ('test_a' and 'test_b'), a carry input ('test_c'), a bit input ('test_bi'), and an opcode for operation selection. The output ports monitored are 'reg_Y_out' displaying the internal state or computation results, 'result_out' expressing the outcome in a specified outcome format, 'c_out' for the carry outcome, 'sign_b', 'zero_b', and 'parity_b' for signal flags, and an 'overflow' indicator. Internally, a variable 'i' serves as a loop counter for iteration through test cases in a procedural block. The code includes setups for initialization and toggling of the clock ('clk') to manage timing, reset controls, input preparations, and procedural loops with display statements for monitoring the output values and states at each simulation step. This thorough testing environment ensures that the ALU's functionality can be confirmed under various scenarios and conditions, making it robust for further integration and use.
