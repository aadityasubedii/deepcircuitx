    "module": "The 'alu_tb' module functions as a test bench for verifying the operations of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) by generating varied test inputs and simulating different operational conditions. It systematically toggles a set of inputs which include data, carry, and control signals through procedural loops to examine output behaviors like result, carry-out, and status flags within a simulated clock environment, ensuring comprehensive coverage and functionality confirmation of the ALU."
