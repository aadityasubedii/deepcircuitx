    "module": "The \"alu\" module serves as an Arithmetic Logic Unit that performs various arithmetic and logical operations on inputs `a_in` and `b_in` depending on the `opcode`. It utilizes registers `a_reg`, `b_reg`, and `opcode_reg` to synchronize input values with the system clock and to ensure stable operation across cycles. Operations are executed in combinational logic blocks, handling different operations by decoding `opcode`, and the result flags like sign, zero, parity, and overflow are dynamically assigned based on the operation results."
