Module specification: The \"glbl\" module is a utility unit designed for digital simulation environments, primarily focusing on the emulation and management of global signals such as Global Set/Reset (GSR) and Global Tristate (GTS), as well as JTAG functionalities. It does not have input ports since all signals are either internally generated or managed as default globals. The output ports include GSR, GTS, PRLD (Preload), GRESTORE (Global Restore), and several JTAG-related outputs like JTAG_TDO_GLBL (JTAG Test Data Output). Each serves a specific purpose, such as controlling initialization, reset states, configuration phases, and simulation test operations of digital circuits. Internally, the module uses registers like GSR_int and GTS_int to manage the state of corresponding outputs, along with various initial blocks that set up the initial timing and conditions for these signals (e.g., initial blocks using parameters like ROC_WIDTH to time the set/reset operations). Overall, this module is crucial for setting up initial conditions in simulations, handling reset/restoration states, and facilitating JTAG operations for testing and boundary scanning within a digital system simulation.",
