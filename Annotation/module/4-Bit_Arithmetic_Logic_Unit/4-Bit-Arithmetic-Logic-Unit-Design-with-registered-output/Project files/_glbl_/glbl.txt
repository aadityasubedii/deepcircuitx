The "glbl" module emulates global control signals like Global Set/Reset (GSR) and Global Tristate (GTS) for digital simulations, crucial for initializing and controlling reset states and configurations. It manages internal signals like GSR_int and GTS_int and uses initial blocks to set specific timing for activating and deactivating these signals, aligning with parameters like ROC_WIDTH for precise control over simulation conditions. This setup supports robust testing and configuration functionalities in a digital circuit simulation environment.
