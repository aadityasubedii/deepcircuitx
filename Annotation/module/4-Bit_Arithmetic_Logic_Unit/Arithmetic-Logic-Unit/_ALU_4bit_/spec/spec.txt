Module name: ALU_4bit.

Module specification: The ALU_4bit is a versatile and compact 4-bit arithmetic logic unit designed to perform a variety of arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations defined by a 4-bit Opcode. The module inputs include two 4-bit operands, A and B, and a 4-bit Opcode that specifies the operation to be carried out. The outputs of the module are a 4-bit result (Out), a zero flag (Z), a carry out flag (C), an overflow flag (V), and a parity flag (P). Internal signals such as temp_C and temp_V maintain temporary states for carry and overflow flags respectively during arithmetic operations, while shift_out, arith_out, comp_out, and logical_out wire arrays store intermediate results from submodules that handle shifting, arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations. These submodules are structured within the main module and include a Shifter, an Arithmetic unit, a Comparator, and a Logical unit, each performing tasks based on the Opcode. A multiplexer (MUX) consolidates results from these submodules into the final output depending on the Opcode. The module accurately handles flag assignments, ensuring that carry and overflow are correctly indicated for relevant operations, and calculates Z and P based on the final output results, indicating zero condition and even or odd parity, respectively.
