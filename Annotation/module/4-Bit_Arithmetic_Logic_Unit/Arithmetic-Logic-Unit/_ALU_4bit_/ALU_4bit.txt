The ALU_4bit module performs a range of arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations on two 4-bit inputs (A and B), controlled by a 4-bit Opcode determining the specific operation. The unit integrates submodules for shifting, arithmetic, logical, and comparison tasks that process these inputs accordingly. Outputs include the operation result, zero, carry, overflow, and parity flags. Critical internal wires like temp_C and temp_V handle temporary storage of carry and overflow flags from arithmetic operations, with a multiplexer consolidating these results based on the Opcode to produce the final output.
