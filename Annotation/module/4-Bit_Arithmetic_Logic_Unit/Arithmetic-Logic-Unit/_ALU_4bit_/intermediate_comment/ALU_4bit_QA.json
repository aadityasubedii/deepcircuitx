The outputs from these operations are selected through a multiplexer based on the Opcode. The module provides flags such as zero flag (Z), carry out (C), overflow flag (V), and parity flag (P) as output indicators of the operations. It handles inputs A and B, and the type of operation is dictated by Opcode."

It is '1' if all bits of Out are zero; otherwise, it is '0'.\n- C (Carry Out Flag): This flag is a single output bit indicates the carry output from the last significant bit in arithmetic operations. It is valid and updated only for certain OpCodes (arithmetic operations) where overflow of the highest bit position might occur.\n- V (Overflow Flag): A single output bit that indicates an overflow error for arithmetic operations (where numbers exceed their maximum representable values causing an overflow).\n- P (Parity Flag): A single output bit representing the parity of the result; it's calculated as the XOR of all the bits of the result (Out). If the number of '1's in the result is even, then P is '0' (even parity), otherwise it's '1' (odd parity)."

It is specifically used to compute and temporarily store the carry output (C) before it is conditionally passed to the output C based on the Opcode.\n- temp_V: Similar to temp_C, this wire signal is a temporary holder for the overflow flag from the arithmetic unit.

Depending on A, B, and the Opcode, various arithmetic operations (like add, subtract) are executed, and the resulting value is kept in arith_out.\n- comp_out: Used to store the result from the Comparator module, comp_out holds the outcome of comparison operations (like equal, not equal) performed based on inputs A and B influenced by the Opcode.\n- logical_out: This wire stores the output from the Logical module, where logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, etc.) are performed on inputs A and B according to the Opcode.
