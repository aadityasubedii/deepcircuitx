The `add_sub_4bit` module performs addition or subtraction on two 4-bit inputs, `A` and `B`, directed by a single-bit `Operator` (0 for addition, 1 for subtraction). The output is a 4-bit `Sum`, a carry-out `Cout`, and an overflow flag `V`. It employs `effective_B` to adjust `B` via XOR with `Operator` and utilizes four `full_adder` instances, each computing a bit of the result and passing carry bits to subsequent stages, while the overflow condition is determined by comparing the carry-out of the last and second last stages.
