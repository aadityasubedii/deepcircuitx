If 'Operator' is 0, it adds the numbers; if 'Operator' is 1, it subtracts them. The 'Sum' output holds the result, 'Cout' is the carry-out from the most significant bit, and 'V' indicates an overflow in the computation. The decision to perform addition or subtraction is handled by XORing each bit of B with the 'Operator', effectively inverting B when performing subtraction. Each stage of the addition or subtraction uses a full adder block that processes one bit of the operands plus a carry-in from the previous stage to produce one bit of the result and a carry-out to the next stage."
