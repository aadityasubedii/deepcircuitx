It functions by initializing input values for A and B and cycling through 16 operations represented by the Opcode, testing the ALU's response to different operations. Each operation is tested briefly (10 ns interval), after which the Opcode is incremented to test the next operation. The results from the ALU, including the output and flag signals (Zero, Carry, Overflow, and Parity), are monitored through the established connections."
