Module name: ALU_4bit_tb. Module specification: The ALU_4bit_tb is a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). Its primary role is to initialize the operand inputs A and B, along with the Opcode, and iteratively test the ALU through 16 different operations by cycling through Opcodes from 0 to 15. Each operation occurs over a 10 ns interval to ascertain the ALUâ€™s responses. The inputs to the module include: A and B, which are 4-bit registers representing the operands for the ALU; and Opcode, a 4-bit register dictating the operation performed on A and B. Outputs from the module consist of Out, a 4-bit wire showing the operation result; Z (Zero flag), indicating if the result is zero; C (Carry flag), showing any carry out from the most significant bit; V (Overflow flag), indicating an overflow occurrence; and P (Parity flag), which signals if the result has an even number of 1's. The internal signal used is 'i', an integer serving as a loop counter to change the Opcode for each test cycle. In the Verilog code, `initial` block is used to set initial conditions and a `for` loop for cycling through the Opcodes, while instantiating the ALU_4bit unit under test (uut) connects these operations with the test bench environment.
