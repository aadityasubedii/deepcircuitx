The ALU_4bit_tb module serves as a testbench for evaluating a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit by systematically testing it with various operations determined by the Opcode. It initializes operand inputs A and B, then employs a loop to iterate through 16 operations, each held for a 10 ns interval, by cycling Opcode values from 0 to 15. The test monitors outputs including the arithmetic result and flag statuses for zero, carry, overflow, and parity, thereby verifying the functionality of the ALU across different scenarios.
