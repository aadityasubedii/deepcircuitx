The Shifter module performs bit shifting on a 4-bit input B based on the lower 2 bits of input A and the type of shift specified by the 4-bit Opcode. It supports left shift, right shift, and a special right shift with MSB propagation of B; defaulting to '0000' for unrecognized opcodes. Internal signals 'left_shift' and 'right_shift' compute the respective shifts, with the final output 'shift_out' determined by comparing Opcode values, showcasing modular control over various bit manipulations.
