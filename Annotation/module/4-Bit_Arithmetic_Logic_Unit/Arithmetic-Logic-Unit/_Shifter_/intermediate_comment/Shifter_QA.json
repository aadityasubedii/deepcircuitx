It can execute a left shift, a right shift, and a modified right shift where the most significant bit (MSB) is filled with B's MSB. The result of the selected shift operation is provided as the output `shift_out`. The type of shift operation depends on the value of Opcode: a standard left shift for Opcode values '0000' and '0001', a standard right shift for Opcode '0010', and a special right shift with MSB propagated for Opcode '0011'. If Opcode does not match any expected value, the output defaults to '0000'."
