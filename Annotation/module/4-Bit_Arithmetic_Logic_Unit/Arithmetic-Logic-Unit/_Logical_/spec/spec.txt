Module name: Logical. 
Module specification: The Logical module is designed to perform bitwise logical operations on two 4-bit input signals, A and B, based on a 4-bit Opcode, and outputs the result as a 4-bit signal. The module defines three ports: 'A' and 'B' are 4-bit input ports where the logical operations are applied, and 'Opcode' is another 4-bit input that determines the type of logical operation (AND, OR, XOR, NOR, or zero) to perform. The output port 'logical_out' emits the 4-bit result of the specified logical operation. There are no internal signals used in this module, as the operations are directly computed from the inputs using a conditional assignment statement. The Verilog code primarily consists of a single continuous assignment statement that uses a nested conditional operator to determine and directly assign the output based on the Opcode's value: AND if Opcode is '1000', OR if '1001', XOR if '1010', NOR if '1011', and '0000' otherwise.
