The specific operation (AND, OR, XOR, NOR, or zero) is determined by the 4-bit Opcode input. Specifically, if Opcode is '1000', the output is the AND of A and B; if '1001', the output is the OR of A and B; if '1010', it is the XOR of A and B; if '1011', it is the NOR of A and B; otherwise, the output is '0000'."
