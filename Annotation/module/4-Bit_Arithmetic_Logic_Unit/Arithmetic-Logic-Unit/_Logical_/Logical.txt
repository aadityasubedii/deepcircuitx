The Logical module performs bitwise logical operations on two 4-bit inputs, A and B, determined by a 4-bit Opcode, and outputs a 4-bit result. It directly computes the output based on the value of Opcode using conditional operators, handling operations such as AND, OR, XOR, NOR, or returning zero for other Opcode values without using any internal signals.
