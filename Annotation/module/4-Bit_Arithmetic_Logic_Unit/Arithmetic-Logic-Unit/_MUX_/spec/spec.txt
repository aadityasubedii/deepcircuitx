Module name: MUX. Module specification: The 'MUX' module in Verilog is designed as a multiplexer tasked with selecting one among four 4-bit signals (`shift_out`, `arith_out`, `logical_out`, `compare_out`) based on the value of a 4-bit `Opcode`. The output, `Out`, presents the value of the selected input signal. Specifically: 
- `shift_out` is selected if `Opcode` is between 0000 and 0011,
- `arith_out` is selected if `Opcode` is between 0100 and 0111,
- `logical_out` is selected if `Opcode` is between 1000 and 1011,
- `compare_out` is selected if `Opcode` is between 1100 and 1111.
There are no internal signals or registers in this module as all operations are conducted using combinational logic directly through the input and output ports. The main code block employs conditional assignments (`assign` statement) that determine the output based on the value of `Opcode`. This efficient design ensures that the output `Out` strictly corresponds to the input indicated by the `Opcode` without the need for extra internal signal processing.
