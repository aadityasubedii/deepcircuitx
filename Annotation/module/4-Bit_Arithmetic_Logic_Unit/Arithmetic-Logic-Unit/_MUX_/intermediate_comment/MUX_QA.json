The output signal `Out` will carry the value of one of these input signals depending on the specific range that the `Opcode` falls into. If `Opcode` is within the ranges 0000 to 0011, 0100 to 0111, 1000 to 1011, or 1100 to 1111, it selects `shift_out`, `arith_out`, `logical_out`, or `compare_out`, respectively.
