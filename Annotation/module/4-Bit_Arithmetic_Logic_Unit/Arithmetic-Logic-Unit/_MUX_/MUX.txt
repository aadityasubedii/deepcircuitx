The MUX module functions as a 4-bit multiplexer selecting one of four input signals based on the 4-bit Opcode value. It outputs `shift_out`, `arith_out`, `logical_out`, or `compare_out` corresponding to Opcode ranges 0000-0011, 0100-0111, 1000-1011, and 1100-1111 respectively, achieving this through direct conditional assignments in its combinational logic without using any internal signals.
