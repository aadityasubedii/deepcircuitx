Module name: Arithmetic. 
Module specification: The Arithmetic module is designed to execute multiple arithmetic operations on 4-bit inputs A and B, dictated by a 4-bit Opcode. This module evaluates four primary operations: addition, increment by 1, subtraction, and decrement by 1. The input ports include A and B, which are the primary 4-bit operands, and Opcode, which decides the operation to be performed. The output ports consist of arith_out, a 4-bit output displaying the result; C, a carry-out single-bit output indicating an overflow or borrow; and V, a single-bit overflow signal marking arithmetic overflow. Internally, the module uses wires sum1, sum2, sum3, and sum4 to store results of these operations performed by instances of a sub-module `add_sub_4bit`. Wires temp_C and temp_V store partial carry-out and overflow signals respectively, which are used to determine the final outputs C and V based on the Opcode. The module handles selection logic to output based on Opcode, utilizing conditional assignments for arith_out, C, and V. Each arithmetic operation leveraged by the module is facilitated through instances of the `add_sub_4bit` submodule, configured appropriately for addition, increment, subtraction, or decrement operations. This design effectively modularizes the arithmetic operations while ensuring correct operation selection and result propagation based on the control input Opcode.
