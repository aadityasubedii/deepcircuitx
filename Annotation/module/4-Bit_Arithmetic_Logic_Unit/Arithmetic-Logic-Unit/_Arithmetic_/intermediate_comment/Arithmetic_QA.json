It can handle four operations: addition, increment, subtraction, and decrement of the 4-bit inputs A and B. Depending on the Opcode, it selects between the results of these operations, which are performed by instances of a sub-module named `add_sub_4bit`. Each operation also generates carry-out (`C`) and overflow (`V`) signals which are conditionally passed as outputs based on the Opcode. The operations are specified as follows: addition of A and B, increment of A by 1, subtraction of B from A, and decrement of A by 1. The specific operation to perform is determined by the value of the Opcode."

Explanation: arith_out is a 4-bit output that provides the result of the selected arithmetic operation. C (Carry-out) is a single-bit output that indicates an overflow out of the most significant bit in addition or a borrow in subtraction. V (Overflow) is a single-bit output that signals an arithmetic overflow, which occurs when the result of an operation is outside the range that can be represented with 4 bits."
