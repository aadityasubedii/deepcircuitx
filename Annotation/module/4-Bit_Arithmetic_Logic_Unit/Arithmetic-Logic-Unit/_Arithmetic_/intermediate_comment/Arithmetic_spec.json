    "spec": "Module name: Arithmetic. \nModule specification: The Arithmetic module is designed to execute multiple arithmetic operations on 4-bit inputs A and B, dictated by a 4-bit Opcode. This module evaluates four primary operations: addition, increment by 1, subtraction, and decrement by 1. The input ports include A and B, which are the primary 4-bit operands, and Opcode, which decides the operation to be performed. The output ports consist of arith_out, a 4-bit output displaying the result; C, a carry-out single-bit output indicating an overflow or borrow; and V, a single-bit overflow signal marking arithmetic overflow. Internally, the module uses wires sum1, sum2, sum3, and sum4 to store results of these operations performed by instances of a sub-module `add_sub_4bit`. Wires temp_C and temp_V store partial carry-out and overflow signals respectively, which are used to determine the final outputs C and V based on the Opcode. The module handles selection logic to output based on Opcode, utilizing conditional assignments for arith_out, C, and V. Each arithmetic operation leveraged by the module is facilitated through instances of the `add_sub_4bit` submodule, configured appropriately for addition, increment, subtraction, or decrement operations. This design effectively modularizes the arithmetic operations while ensuring correct operation selection and result propagation based on the control input Opcode.",

It can handle four operations: addition, increment, subtraction, and decrement of the 4-bit inputs A and B. Depending on the Opcode, it selects between the results of these operations, which are performed by instances of a sub-module named `add_sub_4bit`. Each operation also generates carry-out (`C`) and overflow (`V`) signals which are conditionally passed as outputs based on the Opcode. The operations are specified as follows: addition of A and B, increment of A by 1, subtraction of B from A, and decrement of A by 1. The specific operation to perform is determined by the value of the Opcode."

Explanation: arith_out is a 4-bit output that provides the result of the selected arithmetic operation. C (Carry-out) is a single-bit output that indicates an overflow out of the most significant bit in addition or a borrow in subtraction. V (Overflow) is a single-bit output that signals an arithmetic overflow, which occurs when the result of an operation is outside the range that can be represented with 4 bits."
