    "module": "The Arithmetic module performs arithmetic operations (addition, increment, subtraction, decrement) on 4-bit operands A and B, controlled by a 4-bit Opcode. It uses instances of the `add_sub_4bit` sub-module for operation execution, generating results and intermediate signals (sum1-4, temp_C, temp_V) which are then selectively outputted as arith_out, C, and V based on the Opcode, ensuring modular execution and dynamic result selection."
