    "module": "The 'full_adder' module computes the sum and carry-out for three input binary digits (A, B, and Cin), embodying the core logic of a full adder in digital circuits. It directly calculates the outputs 'Sum' and 'Cout' using the expression `{Cout, Sum} = A + B + Cin;`, enabling efficient addition without internal intermediate storage, streamlined for cascading in multi-bit addition scenarios."
