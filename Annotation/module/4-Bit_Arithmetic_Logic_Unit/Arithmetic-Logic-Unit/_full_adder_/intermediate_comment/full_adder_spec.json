    "spec": "Module name: full_adder. Module specification: The 'full_adder' module is designed to implement the functionality of a digital full adder, which accurately computes the sum of three binary digits: A, B, and the carry-in bit (Cin). These inputs contribute to the outputs, Sum and Cout (carry out). Specifically, A and B are the primary binary inputs aimed at computing the sum. Cin acts as the carry-in from a previous addition, facilitating multi-bit addition operations by cascading multiple adders. The output, Sum, denotes the one-bit result of adding the inputs, while Cout, the carry-out, indicates an overflow if set, suggesting that the sum has exceeded a single bit's capacity. This module does not use internal signals; instead, it directly calculates the outputs using the concise arithmetic operation `{Cout, Sum} = A + B + Cin;` in the Verilog code block, streamlining its implementation. The code consists of the module's declaration, port declaration, and a direct arithmetic assignment for output computation, demonstrating a simple and efficient approach to digital addition in hardware design.",
