The possible comparison operations are checking for equality (A == B), inequality (A != B), greater than ($signed(A) > $signed(B)), and less than ($signed(A) < $signed(B)). The result of the comparison is a 4-bit output, `comp_out`, where the most significant three bits are set to zero and the least significant bit reflects the result of the comparison specified by the Opcode.

The specific operations available (equality, inequality, greater than, less than) are determined by the value of Opcode.\n\nOutput ports: comp_out.\nExplanation: comp_out is a 4-bit output signal where the most significant three bits are set to zero and the least significant bit represents the result of the comparison as specified by Opcode. This output reports whether the condition corresponding to the value of the Opcode is true or false (with true represented as 1 and false as 0).
