    "module": "The Comparator module compares two 4-bit inputs, A and B, based on a 4-bit Opcode that specifies the type of comparison: equality, inequality, greater than, or less than. The result is output on a 4-bit signal `comp_out`, where only the least significant bit is used to indicate the result (1 for true, 0 for false), and the other three bits are zeroed. Comparisons are conducted directly using conditional logic with the Opcode determining the specific operation and the module outputs 4'b0000 if no conditions match the Opcode."
