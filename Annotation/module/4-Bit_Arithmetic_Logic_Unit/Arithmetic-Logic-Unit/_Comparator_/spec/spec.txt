Module name: Comparator. Module Specification: The Comparator module in Verilog is designed to perform various comparison operations between two 4-bit inputs, denoted as A and B, controlled by a 4-bit Opcode. Each comparison operation (equality, inequality, greater than, and less than) is designated by specific Opcode values. The input ports include: `A` and `B` which are the 4-bit operands for comparison; and `Opcode` which determines the type of comparison operation. The output port, `comp_out`, is a 4-bit signal where only the least significant bit is used to indicate the result of the comparison — 1 for true, and 0 for false — while the most significant three bits are set to zero. If the Opcode does not correspond to any valid comparison, `comp_out` provides 4'b0000. Internal signals defined in the module include `AeB` and `AnB`, which store the results of equality and inequality comparisons respectively. Although `AgB` and `AlB` are declared for potential use with greater-than and less-than operations, they are not used explicitly and these comparisons are implemented directly in the conditional blocks of code. The module's main functional block evaluates the Opcode and selectively outputs the comparison results through the `comp_out` based on the operation specified by the Opcode: 4'b1100 for equality, 4'b1101 for inequality, 4'b1110 for greater than, and 4'b1111 for less than comparisons.
