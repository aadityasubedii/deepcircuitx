    "spec": "Module name: full_adder. Module specification: The 'full_adder' module is designed to perform the function of a full adder, a fundamental digital circuit that computes the sum of three binary digits: two primary input digits and one carry-in bit. This module includes three input ports: 'a', 'b', and 'cin'. 'a' and 'b' are the primary binary digits for addition, while 'cin' serves as the carry-in bit which is added to the sum of 'a' and 'b'. The outputs are two ports: 'sum' and 'carry'. The 'sum' output is derived by performing an exclusive OR (XOR) operation on the inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin', giving the direct sum of the inputs while considering any incoming carry. The 'carry' output indicates whether an addition operation between any two or all three inputs results in a carry, computed using an OR operation between all combinations of AND operations on the inputs. Internally, the module does not utilize any signals or storage beyond the defined inputs and outputs; both 'sum' and 'carry' are computed directly through assignments in the module's code with no intermediate computation stages or internal signal paths, ensuring efficient and straightforward operation.",
