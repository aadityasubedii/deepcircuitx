Module-level comment: The 'full_adder' module performs summation of three binary digits ('a', 'b', 'cin'), outputting a 'sum' and a 'carry'. Utilizes XOR for 'sum' and a combination of ANDs and OR for 'carry', directly mapping input operations to outputs without internal signals, ensuring simple and straightforward functionality.
