Module name: tb_full_adder. Module specification: The "tb_full_adder" module serves as a testbench designed to verify the correctness of a full adder circuit, named 'FA1', by stimulating it with all possible combinations of input values for signals 'a', 'b', and 'cin'. It observes the resulting 'carry' and 'sum' outputs to ensure that the full adder operates accurately. The inputs to this module, 'a', 'b', and 'cin', represent the two binary digits to be added and the carry-in bit, respectively. The outputs, 'carry' and 'sum', indicate the carry-out bit and the least significant bit of the sum, crucial for multi-bit addition in larger circuits. Internally, 'carry' and 'sum' are wires that connect to the corresponding outputs of the 'FA1' instance of the full adder, and are essential for the verification logic in the testbench. The code strategically tests all possible input combinations by sequentially applying input values with a 5ns delay between each set, ensuring a clear observation of transitions and outcomes. Finally, after all combinations are tested, the simulation is halted. This structured approach to testing and observation within the testbench module facilitates a comprehensive verification of the full adder's functionality.
