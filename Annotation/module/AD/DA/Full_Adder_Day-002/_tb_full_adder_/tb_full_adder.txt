Module-level comment: The "tb_full_adder" module is a testbench that verifies a full adder circuit's operation by applying all input bit combinations to the inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin'. The internal wires 'carry' and 'sum' are monitored to assess the adder's output correctness. The module iterates through the input space with a delay to allow for clear observation, halting the simulation after completion.
