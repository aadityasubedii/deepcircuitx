    "module": "Module-level comment: The top_8t8r module manages interfacing with 8-channel ADCs/DACs, providing control via SPI and synchronization based on various internal clocks. It processes signals with dedicated clk_rst, spi_intf, data_proc, adc9653_intf, and dac3484_intf blocks, outputs diagnostics, and controls an FPGA_LED status indicator."
