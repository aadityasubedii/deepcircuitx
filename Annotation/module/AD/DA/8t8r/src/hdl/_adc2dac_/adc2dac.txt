Module-level comment: The adc2dac module synchronizes and processes 16-bit inputs from eight ADC channels, outputting them for DAC use. It features three-stage input registration for timing stability, utilizes dual-port RAMs for data staging, and handles cross-clock domain transfers. Outputs are synchronized to a 250MHz clock with a valid signal indicating data integrity across the ADC and DAC interfaces.
