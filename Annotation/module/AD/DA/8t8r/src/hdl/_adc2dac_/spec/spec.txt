Module name: adc2dac. Module specification: The `adc2dac` module integrates multiple ADC channels' data acquisition, processes them synchronically, and outputs to DAC channels. It handles eight 16-bit data inputs from `din0` to `din7`, synchronizes them into processed outputs across differing clock domains, and signals when data is valid through multiple pipeline stages and cross-clock synchronization. **Input ports** include three clocks (`clk_adc0`, `clk_adc1`, `clk_250m` for different ADC domains and output domain), three resets (`rst_adc0`, `rst_adc1`, `rst_250m` for respective domains), and eight data inputs (`din0` to `din7` for ADC channels). **Output ports** consist of a `valid` signal indicating data readiness and eight `dout` channels (`dout0` to `dout7`), conveying the processed outputs. **Internal signals** like `dinX_r1`, `dinX_r2`, and `dinX_r3` (where X ranges from 0 to 7) form three-stage pipelines for each data input to stabilize data transfer between clock domains. Dual-port RAMs are manipulated using signals `wea`, `addr`, and concatenated data inputs (`din_adc0`, `din_adc1`), utilized for staging processed data. The module is divided into several blocks: synchronization stages for each clock domain using multi-stage registers, memory blocks for data staging managed by conditional address and write controls, and output logic adjusted to the high-speed `clk_250m` domain, reading from dual-port RAMs and driving the output ports. Integrated Logic Analyzers (ILAs) are also instantiated for debugging purposes in the respective ADC domains. The entire operation is encapsulated such that after initial stage settings with resets, data flows through stages, gets processed, and ends up accurately on the outputs synchronized with a 250 MHz clock, maintaining integrity across various clock domains.
