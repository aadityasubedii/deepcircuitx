    "spec": "Module name: adc2dac. Module specification: The `adc2dac` module integrates multiple ADC channels' data acquisition, processes them synchronically, and outputs to DAC channels. It handles eight 16-bit data inputs from `din0` to `din7`, synchronizes them into processed outputs across differing clock domains, and signals when data is valid through multiple pipeline stages and cross-clock synchronization. **Input ports** include three clocks (`clk_adc0`, `clk_adc1`, `clk_250m` for different ADC domains and output domain), three resets (`rst_adc0`, `rst_adc1`, `rst_250m` for respective domains), and eight data inputs (`din0` to `din7` for ADC channels). **Output ports** consist of a `valid` signal indicating data readiness and eight `dout` channels (`dout0` to `dout7`), conveying the processed outputs. **Internal signals** like `dinX_r1`, `dinX_r2`, and `dinX_r3` (where X ranges from 0 to 7) form three-stage pipelines for each data input to stabilize data transfer between clock domains. Dual-port RAMs are manipulated using signals `wea`, `addr`, and concatenated data inputs (`din_adc0`, `din_adc1`), utilized for staging processed data. The module is divided into several blocks: synchronization stages for each clock domain using multi-stage registers, memory blocks for data staging managed by conditional address and write controls, and output logic adjusted to the high-speed `clk_250m` domain, reading from dual-port RAMs and driving the output ports. Integrated Logic Analyzers (ILAs) are also instantiated for debugging purposes in the respective ADC domains. The entire operation is encapsulated such that after initial stage settings with resets, data flows through stages, gets processed, and ends up accurately on the outputs synchronized with a 250 MHz clock, maintaining integrity across various clock domains.",

It receives 16-bit data inputs from eight different channels (din0 to din7), synchronizes and processes them in stages through registers, and then outputs them along with a valid signal. Advanced operations in the module involve registering the inputs multiple times to mitigate timing issues, packing them into 64-bit groups for processing in dual-port RAMs tailored for each ADC clock domain, and then cross-clock domain data handling to output processed data at a 250 MHz clock domain. The module includes instantiation of Integrated Logic Analyzers (ILAs) for debugging and uses dual-port RAMs for storing and retrieving processed data.

It is used in the data synchronization and output stages of the module.\n- **rst_adc0, rst_adc1, rst_250m**: These are reset inputs for the ADC0, ADC1, and 250 MHz clock domains, respectively.

The pipeline stages help in stabilizing the data across clock domains (adc0 and adc1 specifically) by reducing metastability and setup/hold violations during clock domain crossings.\n\n- **wea_adc0, wea_adc1**: These are write enable signals for the dual-port RAMs associated with each ADC domain. They control when data can be written into the RAM.\n\n- **addr_adc0, addr_adc1**: These are 3-bit wide address signals for the each dual-port RAM in the adc0 and adc1 domains. They determine the location in the RAM where data will be written or read.\n\n- **din_adc0, din_adc1**: These are 64-bit wide signals used to bundle the dinX_r3 (where X is 0 to 3 for adc0 and 4 to 7 for adc1) signals together before they are written into the dual-port RAM.\n\n- **addr_250m**: This is a 3-bit wide address signal for reading data from the dual-port RAMs in the 250 MHz clock domain.\n\n- **valid_250m**: This is a control signal toggled every cycle of clk_250m after the rst_250m is deasserted. It's used to control the timing of when the address counter (addr_250m) is incremented, thus controlling the timing of data read accesses to the dual-port RAMs.\n\n- **douta_250m, doutb_250m**: These are 64-bit wide signals that contain the data read from the dual-port RAMs in the 250 MHz domain. The first half of each signal (bits 63:32) corresponds to the data from ADC0 (douta_250m) or ADC1 (doutb_250m), while the second half (bits 31:0) corresponds to the other two channels from ADC0 or ADC1. These signals are then sliced into individual 16-bit words to form the final dout0 to dout7 outputs."

The pipeline stages help in stabilizing the data across clock domains (adc0 and adc1 specifically) by reducing metastability and setup/hold violations during clock domain crossings.\n\n- **wea_adc0, wea_adc1**: These are write enable signals for the dual-port RAMs associated with each ADC domain. They control when data can be written into the RAM.\n\n- **addr_adc0, addr_adc1**: These are 3-bit wide address signals for the each dual-port RAM in the adc0 and adc1 domains. They determine the location in the RAM where data will be written or read.\n\n- **din_adc0, din_adc1**: These are 64-bit wide signals used to bundle the dinX_r3 (where X is 0 to 3 for adc0 and 4 to 7 for adc1) signals together before they are written into the dual-port RAM.\n\n- **addr_250m**: This is a 3-bit wide address signal for reading data from the dual-port RAMs in the 250 MHz clock domain.\n\n- **valid_250m**: This is a control signal toggled every cycle of clk_250m after the rst_250m is deasserted. It's used to control the timing of when the address counter (addr_250m) is incremented, thus controlling the timing of data read accesses to the dual-port RAMs.\n\n- **douta_250m, doutb_250m**: These are 64-bit wide signals that contain the data read from the dual-port RAMs in the 250 MHz domain. The first half of each signal (bits 63:32) corresponds to the data from ADC0 (douta_250m) or ADC1 (doutb_250m), while the second half (bits 31:0) corresponds to the other two channels from ADC0 or ADC1. These signals are then sliced into individual 16-bit words to form the final dout0 to dout7 outputs."

Module specification: The `adc2dac` module integrates multiple ADC channels' data acquisition, processes them synchronically, and outputs to DAC channels. It handles eight 16-bit data inputs from `din0` to `din7`, synchronizes them into processed outputs across differing clock domains, and signals when data is valid through multiple pipeline stages and cross-clock synchronization. **Input ports** include three clocks (`clk_adc0`, `clk_adc1`, `clk_250m` for different ADC domains and output domain), three resets (`rst_adc0`, `rst_adc1`, `rst_250m` for respective domains), and eight data inputs (`din0` to `din7` for ADC channels). **Output ports** consist of a `valid` signal indicating data readiness and eight `dout` channels (`dout0` to `dout7`), conveying the processed outputs. **Internal signals** like `dinX_r1`, `dinX_r2`, and `dinX_r3` (where X ranges from 0 to 7) form three-stage pipelines for each data input to stabilize data transfer between clock domains. Dual-port RAMs are manipulated using signals `wea`, `addr`, and concatenated data inputs (`din_adc0`, `din_adc1`), utilized for staging processed data. The module is divided into several blocks: synchronization stages for each clock domain using multi-stage registers, memory blocks for data staging managed by conditional address and write controls, and output logic adjusted to the high-speed `clk_250m` domain, reading from dual-port RAMs and driving the output ports. Integrated Logic Analyzers (ILAs) are also instantiated for debugging purposes in the respective ADC domains. The entire operation is encapsulated such that after initial stage settings with resets, data flows through stages, gets processed, and ends up accurately on the outputs synchronized with a 250 MHz clock, maintaining integrity across various clock domains."
