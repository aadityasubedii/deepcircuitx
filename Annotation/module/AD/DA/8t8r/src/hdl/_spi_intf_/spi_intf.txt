Module-level comment: The 'spi_intf' module interfaces an ARM A7 processor with SPI-based peripherals like ADCs and DACs using control and data signals. It orchestrates device selection, communication and resets through GPIO inputs, SPI clocking, and data lines. The module dynamically routes MISO data based on active peripherals and maintains device-specific control through clk synchronization, chip select, and bidirectional data handling, providing organized access to multiple SPI devices.
