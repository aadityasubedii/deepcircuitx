The inputs to this module include clock signals, control signals, and MOSI (Master Out Slave In) signals from the processor. The outputs controlled include chip select signals, reset signals, and clock signals for each ADC and DAC, as well as control signals like transmission enable and sleep mode signals for DACs. The module dynamically assigns the MISO (Master In Slave Out) signal based on the active ADC or DAC interface selected by the ARM's GPIO pins. Additionally, the module handles reset conditions for the ADCs and DACs based on specific GPIO signals. The overall functionality revolves around managing SPI communication with multiple devices using control inputs from a single master processor."
