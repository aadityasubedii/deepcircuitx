    "module": "Module-level comment: The `dac3484_intf` module interfaces with a DAC, processing 4 channels of 16-bit digital data, managing clock synchronization, and generating differential output signals. Implementation uses a `DAC_interface` submodule for data handling, an `OBUFDS` for differential status signaling, and internal signal assignments for control logic."
