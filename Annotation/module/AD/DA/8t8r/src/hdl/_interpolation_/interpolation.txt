Module-level comment: The 'interpolation' module synchronizes and filters 8 parallel 16-bit data streams using a clock signal. It employs internal registers to latch inputs on the clock's rising edge, which are then processed by 'filter' instances. Resulting 24-bit filtered data is truncated to 16 bits and updated in output registers, conditional on the reset signal.
