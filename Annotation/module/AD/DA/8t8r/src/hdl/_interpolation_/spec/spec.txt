Module name: interpolation. 
Module specification: The 'interpolation' module is designed for processing 8 distinct streams of input data, each 16 bits wide, via a synchronous digital signal processing approach. It operates based on a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst`) to a known state. An additional input signal (`valid`) indicates the validity of the current input data. The module leverages internal registers (`datain0` to `datain7`) to temporarily store the input data (`din0` to `din7`) on the rising edge of the clock, provided the reset is not active. These stored inputs are then forwarded to individual instances of a `filter` module (`u_filter_d0` to `u_filter_d7`), which likely perform specific filtering operations, outputting results with an expanded 24-bit width. Subsequently, the module truncates these 24-bit outputs back to 16 bits and stores them in output registers (`dout0` to `dout7`), which are updated on the clock's rising edge unless reset. The internal implementation is structured into two main blocks, each triggered by the positive edge of the clock: the first block handles the capturing and resetting of input data into the internal registers, while the second block manages the truncation of the filtered data and updates the output registers accordingly. Through this structured approach, the module synchronously processes and filters multiple streams of digital input data, offering a streamlined pathway for data refinement in complex digital signal processing applications.
