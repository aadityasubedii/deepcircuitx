Module name: rst_sync. Module specification: The rst_sync module is designed for synchronizing an asynchronous reset signal `i_rst_async` to the clock domain of `i_in_clk`. This ensures a stable and glitch-free reset signal across the rest of the system, minimizing metastability risks. It accepts two input ports: `i_in_clk`, which is the clock signal used to latch the internal and output reset states ensuring their synchronization to this clock domain; and `i_rst_async`, an asynchronous reset signal that, when asserted, initiates a reset sequence. The module produces one output signal, `o_rst_sync`, which provides the synchronized reset output to downstream logic. Internally, the module uses a series of six flip-flops (rst_1d to rst_6d) to delay and stabilize the reset signal, each capturing the state of the previous flip-flop upon the positive edge of `i_in_clk`. The Verilog code implements these functionalities using an always block that checks for the rising edge of `i_in_clk` or `i_rst_async`. Inside this block, if `i_rst_async` is asserted, all flip-flops and the output reset are set high. If not, a cascading reset through the flip-flops occurs, gradually asserting the synchronous reset only after several cycles, indicated by the internal chaining of states from `rst_1d` to `rst_6d` and finally to `o_rst_sync`. This design ensures a robust and well-synchronized reset mechanism appropriate for high-reliability systems.
