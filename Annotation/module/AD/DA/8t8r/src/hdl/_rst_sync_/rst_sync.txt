Module-level comment: The rst_sync module synchronizes an asynchronous reset signal, i_rst_async, with a clock domain i_in_clk to prevent metastability in downstream logic. It uses a series of six flip-flops (rst_1d to rst_6d) to stabilize and delay the reset signal, with an always block triggered on the positive edge of i_in_clk or i_rst_async. If i_rst_async is asserted, all flip-flops and the output, o_rst_sync, are set high. Otherwise, a ripple reset through the flip-flops deasserts o_rst_sync after several clock cycles, ensuring a safe and synchronized reset.
