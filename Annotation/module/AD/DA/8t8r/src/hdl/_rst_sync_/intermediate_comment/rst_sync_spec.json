    "spec": "Module name: rst_sync. Module specification: The rst_sync module is designed for synchronizing an asynchronous reset signal `i_rst_async` to the clock domain of `i_in_clk`. This ensures a stable and glitch-free reset signal across the rest of the system, minimizing metastability risks. It accepts two input ports: `i_in_clk`, which is the clock signal used to latch the internal and output reset states ensuring their synchronization to this clock domain; and `i_rst_async`, an asynchronous reset signal that, when asserted, initiates a reset sequence. The module produces one output signal, `o_rst_sync`, which provides the synchronized reset output to downstream logic. Internally, the module uses a series of six flip-flops (rst_1d to rst_6d) to delay and stabilize the reset signal, each capturing the state of the previous flip-flop upon the positive edge of `i_in_clk`. The Verilog code implements these functionalities using an always block that checks for the rising edge of `i_in_clk` or `i_rst_async`. Inside this block, if `i_rst_async` is asserted, all flip-flops and the output reset are set high. If not, a cascading reset through the flip-flops occurs, gradually asserting the synchronous reset only after several cycles, indicated by the internal chaining of states from `rst_1d` to `rst_6d` and finally to `o_rst_sync`. This design ensures a robust and well-synchronized reset mechanism appropriate for high-reliability systems.",

The module has a series of D flip-flops (`rst_1d` to `rst_6d`) chained together and all triggered by the positive edge of the clock. When an asynchronous reset is detected, the module sets all flip-flops and the synchronous output reset (`o_rst_sync`) to a high level, effectively asserting the synchronized reset. Conversely, when there is no asynchronous reset, the flip-flops create a ripple effect, passing the reset condition down the chain each clock cycle until the synchronous reset output is deasserted. This setup ensures that the reset stays asserted for at least several clock cycles, providing a stable reset signal to downstream logic synchronized to `i_in_clk`."

It serves to initiate a reset sequence when asserted. This reset can occur at any time, independent of the clock, and its purpose is to ensure that the entire circuit returns to a known state in case of unexpected behaviors or conditions.\n\nOutput ports: `o_rst_sync`.\nExplanation:\n- `o_rst_sync`: This is the synchronized reset output port. It outputs a reset signal that has been synchronized to the input clock `i_in_clk`.

Each flip-flop captures the state of its preceding flip-flop (or the reset input for `rst_1d`) on the rising edge of the clock signal. The role of these internal signals is to propagate the reset through a series of registers to filter out any glitches and to securely synchronize the asynchronous reset signal to the clock domain of `i_in_clk`, effectively deasserting the synchronized reset signal `o_rst_sync` only after it has been stable for several clock cycles.
