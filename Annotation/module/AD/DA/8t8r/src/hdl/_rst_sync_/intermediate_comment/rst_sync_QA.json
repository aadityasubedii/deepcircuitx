The module has a series of D flip-flops (`rst_1d` to `rst_6d`) chained together and all triggered by the positive edge of the clock. When an asynchronous reset is detected, the module sets all flip-flops and the synchronous output reset (`o_rst_sync`) to a high level, effectively asserting the synchronized reset. Conversely, when there is no asynchronous reset, the flip-flops create a ripple effect, passing the reset condition down the chain each clock cycle until the synchronous reset output is deasserted. This setup ensures that the reset stays asserted for at least several clock cycles, providing a stable reset signal to downstream logic synchronized to `i_in_clk`."

This reset can occur at any time, independent of the clock, and its purpose is to ensure that the entire circuit returns to a known state in case of unexpected behaviors or conditions.\n\nOutput ports: `o_rst_sync`.\nExplanation:\n- `o_rst_sync`: This is the synchronized reset output port. It outputs a reset signal that has been synchronized to the input clock `i_in_clk`.
