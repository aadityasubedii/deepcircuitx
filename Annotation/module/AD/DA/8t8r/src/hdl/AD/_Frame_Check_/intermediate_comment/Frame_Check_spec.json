    "spec": "Module name: Frame_Check.\n\nModule specification: The Frame_Check module serves as an interface for a serial data stream, utilizing an ISERDESE2 component for deserialization. It functions in DDR mode to convert an incoming Frame signal into an 8-bit parallel output, all while actively monitoring for data alignment. Input ports include Frame (serial data input), clk (primary clock), clk_div (divided clock for comparison operations), and rst_in (reset). The sole output, bitslip_out, indicates whether a bitslip, also known as a data realignment, has occurred. Internally, the module uses bitslip (a control signal for bitslip operation), serdes_out (8-bit parallel data), check_enable (a pattern checking control), judge_cnt (a counter for delays in pattern checking), and serdes_out_reg (a register for storing serdes_out). The code is organized into instantiation of the ISERDESE2, combinational logic for pattern matching, and sequential blocks for registering the deserialized data, managing bitslip, and incrementing judge_cnt post-reset. The module ensures the reception and alignment of serial data is reliable, particularly crucial in DDR interfacing applications.",

It operates in a Double Data Rate (DDR) mode with a fixed data width of 8. The module monitors the deserialized output for a specific pattern (in this case, 8'hF0) at a clock division rate provided by clk_div. If the pattern does not match and a certain condition (defined by judge_cnt) is met, a bitslip operation is triggered, indicated by the bitslip_out signal. This bitslip mechanism essentially aligns the data correctly if it has been received out of phase. The module also incorporates a reset functionality controlled by the rst_in input, which resets the internal state used for checking the alignment. This process aims to ensure reliable data reception and alignment in a communication or data processing system where DDR interfacing is utilized."

It forms the primary data input to the ISERDESE2 instance within the module.\n- `clk`: This is the primary clock input for the ISERDESE2 instance which is used for capturing the incoming serial data in DDR mode.\n- `clk_div`: This clock signal is typically a divided version of `clk` and is used to drive the internal logic of the module that operates at a lower frequency.\n- `rst_in`: This active-high reset input is used to reset the internal state of the module, including the deserialized data register `serdes_out_reg` and the judge counter `judge_cnt`.\n\nOutput ports: `bitslip_out`.\nExplanation:\n- `bitslip_out`: This output signal indicates whether a bitslip event has occurred. A bitslip is a method to align the incoming data by effectively shifting the sampling phase. If `bitslip_out` is asserted (`bitslip_out = 1`), this means the module has detected a misalignment indicated by not receiving the expected pattern (8'hF0) when `check_enable` is high, thus initiating a bitslip operation."

It is set to '1' when the deserialized data does not match the expected frame pattern (8'hF0) and `check_enable` is high, otherwise, it is cleared to '0'.\n- `serdes_out`: This 8-bit wire is connected to the parallel output of the deserialized data from the ISERDESE2 instance. It represents the parallel version of the serial `Frame` input after deserialization.\n- `check_enable`: This wire is a control signal derived from the `judge_cnt` register. It enables checking of the `serdes_out_reg` against the expected pattern (8'hF0). When `judge_cnt` is equal to '0', `check_enable` is high, allowing the comparison to take place.\n- `judge_cnt`: A 5-bit register (with the `keep` attribute for synthesis tools to preserve during optimization) that acts as a counter. Its purpose is to enable the pattern check after reset by controlling `check_enable`. It also helps prevent continuous bitslip operations by introducing a delay before rechecking the `serdes_out_reg`.\n- `serdes_out_reg`: This is an 8-bit register used to store the value of `serdes_out` at the rising edge of `clk_div`. It holds the data stable for comparison and control purposes during the slower clock's period."
