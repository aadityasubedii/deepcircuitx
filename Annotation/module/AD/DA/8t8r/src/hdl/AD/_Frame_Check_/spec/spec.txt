Module name: Frame_Check.

Module specification: The Frame_Check module serves as an interface for a serial data stream, utilizing an ISERDESE2 component for deserialization. It functions in DDR mode to convert an incoming Frame signal into an 8-bit parallel output, all while actively monitoring for data alignment. Input ports include Frame (serial data input), clk (primary clock), clk_div (divided clock for comparison operations), and rst_in (reset). The sole output, bitslip_out, indicates whether a bitslip, also known as a data realignment, has occurred. Internally, the module uses bitslip (a control signal for bitslip operation), serdes_out (8-bit parallel data), check_enable (a pattern checking control), judge_cnt (a counter for delays in pattern checking), and serdes_out_reg (a register for storing serdes_out). The code is organized into instantiation of the ISERDESE2, combinational logic for pattern matching, and sequential blocks for registering the deserialized data, managing bitslip, and incrementing judge_cnt post-reset. The module ensures the reception and alignment of serial data is reliable, particularly crucial in DDR interfacing applications.
