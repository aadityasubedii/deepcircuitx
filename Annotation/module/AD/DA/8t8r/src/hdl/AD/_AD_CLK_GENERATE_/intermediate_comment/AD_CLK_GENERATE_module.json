    "module": "Module-level comment: The AD_CLK_GENERATE module conditions input clock `dco` by applying a programmable delay to generate high-performance `clk_out` and frequency-divided `clk_div_out`. It employs an `IDELAYE2` for manageable delay adjustments, and `BUFR` and `BUFIO` for clock output generation. Delay updates are triggered by synchronized `re_sync_in` signals, ensuring responsive and stable clock outputs for dynamic applications."
