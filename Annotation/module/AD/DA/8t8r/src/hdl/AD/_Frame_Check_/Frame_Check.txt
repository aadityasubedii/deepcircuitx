Module-level comment: The Frame_Check module interfaces with a serial data stream using an ISERDESE2 component to deserialize it into an 8-bit output. It checks for data misalignments by monitoring a specific pattern and triggers a bitslip mechanism if the pattern isn't found. This ensures alignment and reliable data reception. Key components include control and data registers, and bit-level operations managed by sequential logic triggered on divided clock signals.
