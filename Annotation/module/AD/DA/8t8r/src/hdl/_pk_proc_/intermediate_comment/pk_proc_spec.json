    "spec": "Module name: pk_proc.\nModule specification: The `pk_proc` module serves as a pipeline register that carries out data buffering, ensuring that each of the eight 16-bit input data lines (`din0` to `din7`) is latched and delayed by one clock cycle, before being forwarded to the corresponding 16-bit output data lines (`dout0` to `dout7`). Additionally, the module generates five constant outputs (`io_db_cb`, `n4_sum`, `n4_pk`, `w4_sum`, `w4_pk`), all of which are tied to a constant value of zero, likely serving as placeholders or part of an incomplete functionality. The module operates under the control of two input signals: `clk`, which is the clock input that triggers data latching on a positive edge, and `rst`, which is an active-high asynchronous reset signal that clears the output registers. Internal to the module, there are no declared signals other than the output registers used to temporarily hold the data from the inputs before transitioning to the outputs. The code is primarily structured into declaration of input and output ports, signal assignments for the constant outputs, and the always block that handles the latching of input data to output registers and the reset behavior, thus representing the core functionality of the module.",

The module has eight 16-bit input data lines (named `din0` to `din7`) and eight corresponding 16-bit output data lines (named `dout0` to `dout7`). When the reset signal `rst` is high, all output data lines are cleared to 0 on the next positive clock edge.

Additionally, there are five outputs (`io_db_cb`, `n4_sum`, `n4_pk`, `w4_sum`, and `w4_pk`) which are constant and driven to zero.
