Module-level comment: The `pk_proc` module is designed as a pipeline register, buffering eight 16-bit input signals (`din0` - `din7`) and outputting them with a one-clock-cycle delay (`dout0` - `dout7`). Implementation is straightforward, utilizing positive edge-triggered behavior for data latching and an asynchronous reset (`rst`) to clear outputs. Additionally, it statically assigns zeros to five other outputs (`io_db_cb`, `n4_sum`, `n4_pk`, `w4_sum`, `w4_pk`), possibly for future extension or integration into a broader system.
