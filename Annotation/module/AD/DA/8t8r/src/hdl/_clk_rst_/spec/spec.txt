Module name: clk_rst. 

Module specification: The `clk_rst` module is designed to generate various clock signals and a reset signal for systems requiring multiple clock domains. It utilizes a differential reference clock input (`clk_a7_refa_p` and `clk_a7_refa_n`) to synthesize multiple clock frequencies using a phase-locked loop (PLL), represented by the `tx_pll` instance. The output clocks include 250 MHz (`clk_250m`), 200 MHz (`clk_200m`), 500 MHz (`clk_500m`), a 500 MHz clock with a 90-degree phase shift (`clk500m_90`), and a 5 MHz clock (`clk_5m`). Additionally, it outputs a `pll_locked` signal indicating the stable state of the PLL. An external reset switch (`rst_sw_n`) is used along with the `pll_locked` signal for generating a synchronized reset signal (`rst_250m`) for systems operating with the 250 MHz clock frequency. This is achieved through an internal signal `rst_sys_async`, which combines the `pll_locked` and `rst_sw_n` to control the asynchronous reset behavior, feeding into the `rst_sync` instance `u_rst_250m` for synchronization. The module also has provisions for input clock signals `clk_adc0` and `clk_adc1`, although they are specified but not utilized within this module's scope. This structured approach ensures reliable reset synchronization and clock signal generation for diverse operational needs and clock domains within digital systems.
