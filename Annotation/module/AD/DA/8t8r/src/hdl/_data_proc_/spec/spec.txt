Module name: data_proc.

Module specification: The `data_proc` module is designed to process digital signals converted from analog signals by analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). It interfaces with eight 16-bit ADC data streams (`adc_data0` to `adc_data7`) and processes these signals to generate corresponding digital-to-analog converter (DAC) outputs (`dac_data0` to `dac_data7`). The module uses three clock inputs (`clk_adc0`, `clk_adc1`, `clk_250m`) and associated reset inputs (`rst_adc0`, `rst_adc1`, `rst_250m`) to maintain synchronization across various processing stages aligned with different ADC data channels or a common 250 MHz clock domain.

The module consists of three main internal blocks: `adc2dac`, `interpolation`, and `pk_proc`. The `adc2dac` block conditions the raw ADC data streams and outputs `data0` to `data7` for the next stage while asserting the `valid` signal when the data is processed and ready. The `interpolation` block receives these processed signals and, upon the `valid` signal reception, performs interpolation on the data, producing the `proc_d0` to `proc_d7` signals. Lastly, the `pk_proc` block processes each interpolated data stream to detect or carry out peak processing, eventually resulting in the `dout0` to `dout7` signals, which directly feed into the output DAC ports. Additional outputs include an 8-bit `io_db_cb` for debug or control purposes and four status signals: `n4_sum`, `n4_pk`, `w4_sum`, and `w4_pk`, which indicate processing status. Each block's operation is synchronized by the `clk_250m` signal and can be reset with the `rst_250m` signal. The architecture of the `data_proc` module reflects a pipeline design where each block's outputs seamlessly become the subsequent block's inputs, ensuring continuous and efficient data processing for digital signal applications.
