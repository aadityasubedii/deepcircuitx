    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'adc9653_intf' module interfaces with the ADC9653, converting differential ADC signals to 16-bit digital outputs, handling power-down and synchronization via clock signals. It consists of differential input buffers, reset logic for ADC sync, an instantiation of 'ADC_interface' for data processing, clock buffering, and data synchronization stages to output stable ADC data for four channels."
