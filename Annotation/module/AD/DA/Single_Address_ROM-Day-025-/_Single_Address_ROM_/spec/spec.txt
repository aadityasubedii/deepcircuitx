Module name: Single_Address_ROM.
Module specification: The Single_Address_ROM module serves as a read-only memory (ROM) designed to deliver predefined 16-bit data based on a 3-bit address input when enabled. It is synchronized by an input clock (`clk`), and the data output is conditional upon the enable signal (`en`). The `clk` input ensures stable data retrieval at the rising edge of each clock cycle, while the `en` input dictates whether the output (`data_out`) actively delivers data or maintains a high-impedance (`Z`) state for safe bus sharing. The module interprets the `addr` input to select from eight potential 16-bit data values ranging from `L0` to `L7`. These internal signals are assigned fixed values that emulate the non-volatile data stored in a ROM. The always block of the code defines the logical behavior to update `data_out` at the positive clock edge in response to the `en` and `addr` signals, with a default case to handle undefined addresses by setting the output to an undetermined (`X`) state. The architecture of this module thereby provides a simple and effective simulated ROM within a synchronous digital system.
