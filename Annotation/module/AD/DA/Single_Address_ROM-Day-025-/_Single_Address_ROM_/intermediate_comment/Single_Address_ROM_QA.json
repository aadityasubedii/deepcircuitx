It includes an input clock (`clk`), an enable signal (`en`), and a 3-bit address (`addr`). The output is a 16-bit data (`data_out`). Within the always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock, if the enable signal is high, the data output is selected according to the input address from eight predefined 16-bit data lines (`L0` to `L7`). If the enable signal is low, the output data is set to a high-impedance state (`z`), signifying an inactive state in tri-state environments."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: `clk`, `en`, `addr`. Explanation: \n- `clk` is the clock input to the module, used to synchronize the reading of data such that the data output changes only at the positive edge (rising edge) of the clock cycle, ensuring stable data retrieval in synchronous systems.\n- `en` is the enable input, which allows the module to either output the selected data or enter a high-impedance state. When high (logic 1), it enables the selection and output of data based on the address input; when low (logic 0), it forces the data output to a high-impedance state, effectively disabling the output.\n- `addr` is a 3-bit address input that specifies which of the pre-defined data values (among the eight possibilities from `L0` to `L7`) is outputted through `data_out` when the module is enabled. Each combination of the 3 bits corresponds to a different data line, making it possible to select any of the 8 predefined data values.\n\nOutput ports: `data_out`. Explanation: \n- `data_out` is a 16-bit output that provides the data stored at the address specified by the `addr` input when the module is enabled. If the enable signal (`en`) is low, `data_out` goes to a high-impedance state (`Z`), indicating the module's output is inactive. This allows for the safe sharing of the output data line with other components in a system that utilizes bus architectures."
