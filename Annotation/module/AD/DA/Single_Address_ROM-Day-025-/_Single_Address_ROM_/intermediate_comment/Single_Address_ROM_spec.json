    "spec": "Module name: Single_Address_ROM.\nModule specification: The Single_Address_ROM module serves as a read-only memory (ROM) designed to deliver predefined 16-bit data based on a 3-bit address input when enabled. It is synchronized by an input clock (`clk`), and the data output is conditional upon the enable signal (`en`). The `clk` input ensures stable data retrieval at the rising edge of each clock cycle, while the `en` input dictates whether the output (`data_out`) actively delivers data or maintains a high-impedance (`Z`) state for safe bus sharing. The module interprets the `addr` input to select from eight potential 16-bit data values ranging from `L0` to `L7`. These internal signals are assigned fixed values that emulate the non-volatile data stored in a ROM. The always block of the code defines the logical behavior to update `data_out` at the positive clock edge in response to the `en` and `addr` signals, with a default case to handle undefined addresses by setting the output to an undetermined (`X`) state. The architecture of this module thereby provides a simple and effective simulated ROM within a synchronous digital system.",

Explanation: \n- `clk` is the clock input to the module, used to synchronize the reading of data such that the data output changes only at the positive edge (rising edge) of the clock cycle, ensuring stable data retrieval in synchronous systems.\n- `en` is the enable input, which allows the module to either output the selected data or enter a high-impedance state. When high (logic 1), it enables the selection and output of data based on the address input; when low (logic 0), it forces the data output to a high-impedance state, effectively disabling the output.\n- `addr` is a 3-bit address input that specifies which of the pre-defined data values (among the eight possibilities from `L0` to `L7`) is outputted through `data_out` when the module is enabled. Each combination of the 3 bits corresponds to a different data line, making it possible to select any of the 8 predefined data values.\n\nOutput ports: `data_out`. Explanation: \n- `data_out` is a 16-bit output that provides the data stored at the address specified by the `addr` input when the module is enabled. If the enable signal (`en`) is low, `data_out` goes to a high-impedance state (`Z`), indicating the module's output is inactive. This allows for the safe sharing of the output data line with other components in a system that utilizes bus architectures."
