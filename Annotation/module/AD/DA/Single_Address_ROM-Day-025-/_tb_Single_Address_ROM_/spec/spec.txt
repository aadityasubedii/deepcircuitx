Module name: TB_Single_Address_ROM. Module specification: The module TB_Single_Address_ROM serves as a testbench for verifying the functionality of a ROM module named Single_Address_ROM. This testbench primarily tests the ROM's response to various address inputs when the enable signal is active. The input ports include a clock signal 'clk', which is used as the timing reference for operations and is toggled every 5ns; an enable signal 'en', which activates data output from the ROM when high and is set to high after an initial 3ns delay; and a 4-bit wide address bus 'addr', which specifies the ROM's memory address to be accessed. The module has no output ports, as it monitors the 16-bit wide data output 'data_out' from the ROM, captured through a wire. Internal signals include 'clk', 'en', 'addr', and 'data_out', in addition to an integer 'i' used for looping through address settings from 0 to 7 in 10ns intervals. The testbench initializes by setting the clk to 0 and enabling the ROM after 3ns, continually toggles the clk signal, cycles through address settings, and terminates simulation 15ns after the last address cycle with the $finish command. This comprehensive setup helps verify the proper output of the ROM based on given addresses when enabled.
