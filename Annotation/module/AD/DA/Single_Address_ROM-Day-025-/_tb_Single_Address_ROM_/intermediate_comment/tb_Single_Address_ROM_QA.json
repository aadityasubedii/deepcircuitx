It simulates how the ROM responds to specific address inputs over time when enabled. The testbench initializes the clock (`clk`) and enable (`en`) signals, continuously toggles the clock every 5ns, sequentially sets the address lines every 10ns, and ends the simulation after going through 8 address settings. The purpose of this testbench is to verify that the ROM module correctly outputs data based on the given addresses when enabled."

It serves as the timing reference for the sequential operations within the ROM and the testbench itself.\n- en: This is the enable signal for the module. It allows the ROM to output data when high (logic 1) and disables data output when low (logic 0).\n- addr: This is the address input for the module represented as a 4-bit wide bus. It specifies the memory address within the ROM from which the data should be read.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation:\n- data_out: This is the data output of the module. It is a 16-bit wide bus that carries the data read from the ROM at the memory address specified by the addr input, provided the enable signal (en) is active.\n\nNote: 'data_out' is only the output of the ROM being tested and not the output of the testbench module itself, as testbenches do not typically have outputs. Their primary function is to apply stimuli to the inputs of the Device Under Test (DUT) and observe its behavior."

In the testbench, it is toggled every 5ns to simulate the clocking behavior observed in typical digital systems.\n- **en**: This is the enable signal for the ROM. In the testbench, it is set to 1 after a delay of 3ns from the beginning of the simulation to enable the ROM, allowing it to output data corresponding to the input address.\n- **addr**: This is the address signal, which is a 4-bit value determining which data location is accessed within the ROM. In the testbench, this signal is sequentially cycled through 8 values to test different data outputs from the ROM.\n- **data_out**: This signal is employed to receive the output data from the ROM based on the address provided. It is a 16-bit bus, reflecting the data width of the ROM's output.\n- **i**: This is an integer used for looping within the testbench's initial block.
