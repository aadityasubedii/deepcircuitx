    "module": "Module-level comment: The TB_Single_Address_ROM module serves as a testbench for the Single_Address_ROM, simulating ROM behavior in response to address inputs when enabled. It initializes `clk` and `en`, toggles `clk` every 5ns, cycles `addr` through 8 settings every 10ns, and terminates after the last address test, ensuring the ROM outputs data correctly for each address."
