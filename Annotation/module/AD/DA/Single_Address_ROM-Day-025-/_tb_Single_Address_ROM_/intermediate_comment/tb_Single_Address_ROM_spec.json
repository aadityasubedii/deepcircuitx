    "spec": "Module name: TB_Single_Address_ROM. Module specification: The module TB_Single_Address_ROM serves as a testbench for verifying the functionality of a ROM module named Single_Address_ROM. This testbench primarily tests the ROM's response to various address inputs when the enable signal is active. The input ports include a clock signal 'clk', which is used as the timing reference for operations and is toggled every 5ns; an enable signal 'en', which activates data output from the ROM when high and is set to high after an initial 3ns delay; and a 4-bit wide address bus 'addr', which specifies the ROM's memory address to be accessed. The module has no output ports, as it monitors the 16-bit wide data output 'data_out' from the ROM, captured through a wire. Internal signals include 'clk', 'en', 'addr', and 'data_out', in addition to an integer 'i' used for looping through address settings from 0 to 7 in 10ns intervals. The testbench initializes by setting the clk to 0 and enabling the ROM after 3ns, continually toggles the clk signal, cycles through address settings, and terminates simulation 15ns after the last address cycle with the $finish command. This comprehensive setup helps verify the proper output of the ROM based on given addresses when enabled.",

It allows the ROM to output data when high (logic 1) and disables data output when low (logic 0).\n- addr: This is the address input for the module represented as a 4-bit wide bus.
