Module name: tb_half_adder. Module specification: The `tb_half_adder` module is a testbench specifically designed to verify the functionality of a `half_adder` circuit. The module does not perform any arithmetic operations itself but instantiates the `half_adder` and applies various test vectors to check its behavior. It features two single-bit input ports, `a` and `b`, which represent the binary values to be added by the `half_adder` circuit. The testbench also includes two single-bit output wires, `carry` and `sum`, which are used for monitoring the behavior of the `half_adder`. The `carry` output indicates an overflow condition when both inputs are high, while the `sum` output represents the least significant bit of the addition result, effectively an XOR of the inputs `a` and `b`. The Verilog code within the testbench comprises an initial block, which applies a sequence of inputs to the `half_adder` and uses the `$monitor` system task to display the inputs and outputs as they change. Additionally, the initial block sets up waveform dumping to a VCD file named "dump.vcd" which aids in the visualization and analysis of the signals throughout the simulation. This structured simulation approach allows for comprehensive testing and validation of the `half_adder` under various input conditions.
