Module-level comment: The `tb_half_adder` is a testbench designed to validate a basic `half_adder` circuit. It stimulates the `half_adder` with a set of predefined inputs and monitors the sum and carry outputs. This module automates the testing process using an initial block that drives input vectors to the `half_adder` and captures the outputs, also generating a VCD file for waveform analysis of the simulation results.
