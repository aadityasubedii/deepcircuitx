Module-level comment: The 'half_adder' module adds two single-bit binary numbers, 'a' and 'b', producing a 'sum' (bit-wise XOR of 'a' and 'b') and a 'carry' (bit-wise AND of 'a' and 'b'). Implemented with direct assignment statements, it encapsulates fundamental digital addition without internal signals, demonstrating efficient computation through direct logic operation outputs.
