Module name: half_adder. Module specification: The 'half_adder' module is a fundamental digital logic component designed to execute binary addition of two single-bit operands. It features two input ports: 'a' and 'b', which are the single-bit binary values to be added. The module provides two output ports: 'carry' and 'sum'. The 'sum' output signifies the bit-wise XOR result of 'a' and 'b', representing the addition result excluding any carry-over, while the 'carry' output indicates the bit-wise AND result of 'a' and 'b', signifying the presence of a carry-out when both inputs are 1. Internally, the module does not use any additional signals, as it performs the logic operations directly in the output assignments. The Verilog code consists mainly of two assignment statements within the body of the module, establishing the direct computation of the 'sum' and 'carry' outputs from the inputs. This efficient design encapsulates the entire functionality of a half adder without the necessity for intermediate calculations or internal storage elements.
