It takes two inputs 'a' and 'b' and produces two outputs: 'sum' and 'carry'. The 'sum' output is the result of the XOR operation between input 'a' and input 'b', representing the sum of 'a' and 'b' without considering the carry. The 'carry' output is the result of the AND operation between 'a' and 'b', indicating whether there is a carry generated from the addition."

The output port `carry` is a single-bit binary number indicating the carry-out resulting from the addition of `a` and `b`. If both inputs are 1, the carry-out will be 1, otherwise, it will be 0."
