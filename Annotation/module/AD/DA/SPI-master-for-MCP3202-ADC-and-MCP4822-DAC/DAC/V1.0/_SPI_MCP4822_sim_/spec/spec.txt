Module name: tb. Module specification: The module "tb" serves as a testbench designed to verify the functionality of an SPI interface to a DAC device, specifically the MCP4822. It coordinates the necessary inputs and observes outputs to ensure proper operation. The input ports include `clk`, a clock signal that synchronizes the activities within the module; `Tx`, a trigger signal that initiates the SPI transaction when set high; and `i_DATA`, a 12-bit digital input representing the analog value to be converted by the DAC. The output ports monitored are `SCK` (Serial Clock), `MOSI` (Master Out Slave In), `LDAC` (Load DAC), `CS` (Chip Select), and `CC` (an extended control signal). Internal signals consist of the same `clk`, `Tx`, and `i_DATA` used as the input stimuli for the unit under test, UUT, defined as `SPI_MCP4822`. The testbench structure includes an always block, creating a 125MHz clock by toggling the `clk` every 4ns. The initial block sets the starting conditions, generates a VCD file for waveform viewing, initializes the signals, and applies the trigger after a delay to start the test, ultimately concluding the simulation after a set duration. This testbench is fundamental in validating that the SPI communication with the MCP4822 DAC is functioning as expected.
