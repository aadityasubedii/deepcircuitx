    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"tb\" module is a testbench for verifying MCP4822 DAC functionality via SPI. It initializes and toggles a 125MHz `clk`, triggers SPI communication with `Tx`, and inputs a sample `i_DATA`. The testbench observes outputs `SCK`, `MOSI`, `LDAC`, `CS`, and `CC`, and simulates the environment for the `SPI_MCP4822` UUT, documenting the signal waveforms and concluding the test after 25\u00b5s."
