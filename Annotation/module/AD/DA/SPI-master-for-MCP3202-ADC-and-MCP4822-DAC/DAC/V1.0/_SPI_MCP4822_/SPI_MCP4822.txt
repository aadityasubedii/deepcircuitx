Module-level comment: The SPI_MCP4822 module interfaces with an MCP4822 DAC, converting 12-bit digital input ('i_DATA') to an analog signal via SPI. It leverages state machine logic, with 'STATE' governing transmission phases, 'DATA_concat' for data prep, 'SCK_count' to drive SPI clock ('SCK'), and 'conversion_count' for bit timing. DAC selection ('CS'), data output ('MOSI'), and update trigger ('LDAC') are managed per SPI protocol, with 'CC' signaling completion.
