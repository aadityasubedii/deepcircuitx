    "spec": "Module name: SPI_MCP4822.\n\nModule specification: The SPI_MCP4822 module provides an interface to the MCP4822 DAC over SPI, allowing a 12-bit digital signal to be converted into an analog output. The module inputs include 'clk' as the timing reference, 'Tx' to trigger data transmission, and 'i_DATA' carrying the digital information to be converted. It outputs 'SCK' as the SPI clock, 'MOSI' for serial data transmission, 'LDAC' held low for immediate DAC output updates, 'CS' to select the DAC, and 'CC' to indicate conversion completion. Internally, the module uses the 'STATE' register to track whether the module is idle or actively sending data, 'DATA_concat' to assemble the 16-bit payload for transmission, 'SCK_count' and 'SCK_count_EN' to manage the SPI clock generation, 'conversion_count' to time the bit sending, and loop index 'i' to step through the payload bits. In the logic, initial blocks initialize the signal conditions, following which 'always' blocks manage the DAC interfacing process: counting conversion cycles, generating the SPI clock, sending data when 'Tx' is active, toggling CS, and indicating completion with 'CC.' Upon completing the transfer or if 'Tx' is low, the module returns to an idle state, ready for the next transaction.",

It takes a digital input `i_DATA` (12 bits) and drives the SPI signals (`SCK`, `MOSI`, `LDAC`, `CS`) to convert the digital value into an analog signal. The module has parameters to configure the MCP4822's settings such as output gain selection (GA), buffering mode (BUF), shutdown mode (SHDN), and channel selection (AB). The main operation is divided into two states: IDLE and SEND. In the IDLE state, the module waits for the `Tx` signal to initiate the data send process. Upon `Tx` being high, it switches to the SEND state, where it begins constructing a 16-bit payload (`DATA_concat`) with the input data and MCP4822 configuration bits, and incrementally sends each bit over MOSI (Master Out Slave In) while generating an SPI clock signal (`SCK`). The sequence continues for a determined number of clock cycles before resetting and going back to IDLE state upon completion. The `LDAC` is held low to ensure immediate data updating on the DAC, `CS` is the chip-select signal used to select the DAC device, and `CC` indicates the completion of a conversion cycle."

It provides the timing reference for all operations within the module, including state transitions and data transfer sequences.\n- `Tx`: Transmit trigger input. When high, it initiates the data conversion and transmission process. It basically serves to control when the module should start the sending operation.\n- `i_DATA`: Digital input data (12 bits). This is the digital information that will be converted into an analog output through the DAC. It forms the main data payload that is processed by the module.\n\nOutput ports: `SCK`, `MOSI`, `LDAC`, `CS`, `CC`.\nExplanation:\n- `SCK`: Serial Clock output. This signal is used to synchronize the data transfer to the DAC. It toggles at regulated intervals as defined by an internal counter, governing when bits are read and processed by the DAC.\n- `MOSI`: Master Out Slave In output. It is the main data line over which bits of the payload (`DATA_concat`) are sent out serially to the DAC.\n- `LDAC`: Load DAC input signal control. It remains low as per the assignment in the code to ensure that the DAC updates its output immediately when data is sent. This signal typically controls when the DAC output is updated.\n- `CS`: Chip Select output. It is used to select the DAC device by toggling low during a send operation and returning high when transmission is finished or in idle state, effectively enabling or disabling the DAC.\n- `CC`: Conversion Complete indicator output. This signal is set high to indicate when a data conversion cycle is complete, signaling the end of a send operation and resetting the environment for a possible new transmit action."

It determines the actions taken in response to the input signals and internal conditions during each clock cycle, guiding the flow of operation between states for data sending or waiting.\n- `DATA_concat`: This register stores the 16-bit payload constructed from the input data `i_DATA` and parameters like `SHDN`, `GA`, `BUF`, and `AB`. This combined data format is what will be sent out serially through MOSI to the DAC.\n- `SCK_count`: This counter is used for generating the SCK clock signal. It counts clock cycles to define the high and low periods of the SCK signal, ensuring correct timing for data transmission.\n- `SCK_count_EN`: This signal enables or disables the `SCK_count` counter. It is controlled by the state of the module, ensuring that SCK is only active during data sending.\n- `conversion_count`: This counter keeps track of the number of clock cycles that have elapsed since the initiation of a data send operation.

The module inputs include 'clk' as the timing reference, 'Tx' to trigger data transmission, and 'i_DATA' carrying the digital information to be converted. It outputs 'SCK' as the SPI clock, 'MOSI' for serial data transmission, 'LDAC' held low for immediate DAC output updates, 'CS' to select the DAC, and 'CC' to indicate conversion completion. Internally, the module uses the 'STATE' register to track whether the module is idle or actively sending data, 'DATA_concat' to assemble the 16-bit payload for transmission, 'SCK_count' and 'SCK_count_EN' to manage the SPI clock generation, 'conversion_count' to time the bit sending, and loop index 'i' to step through the payload bits. In the logic, initial blocks initialize the signal conditions, following which 'always' blocks manage the DAC interfacing process: counting conversion cycles, generating the SPI clock, sending data when 'Tx' is active, toggling CS, and indicating completion with 'CC.' Upon completing the transfer or if 'Tx' is low, the module returns to an idle state, ready for the next transaction."
