Module name: SPI_MCP4822.

Module specification: The SPI_MCP4822 module provides an interface to the MCP4822 DAC over SPI, allowing a 12-bit digital signal to be converted into an analog output. The module inputs include 'clk' as the timing reference, 'Tx' to trigger data transmission, and 'i_DATA' carrying the digital information to be converted. It outputs 'SCK' as the SPI clock, 'MOSI' for serial data transmission, 'LDAC' held low for immediate DAC output updates, 'CS' to select the DAC, and 'CC' to indicate conversion completion. Internally, the module uses the 'STATE' register to track whether the module is idle or actively sending data, 'DATA_concat' to assemble the 16-bit payload for transmission, 'SCK_count' and 'SCK_count_EN' to manage the SPI clock generation, 'conversion_count' to time the bit sending, and loop index 'i' to step through the payload bits. In the logic, initial blocks initialize the signal conditions, following which 'always' blocks manage the DAC interfacing process: counting conversion cycles, generating the SPI clock, sending data when 'Tx' is active, toggling CS, and indicating completion with 'CC.' Upon completing the transfer or if 'Tx' is low, the module returns to an idle state, ready for the next transaction.
