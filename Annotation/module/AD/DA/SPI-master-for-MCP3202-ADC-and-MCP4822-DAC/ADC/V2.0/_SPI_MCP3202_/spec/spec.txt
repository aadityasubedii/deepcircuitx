Module name: SPI_MCP3202. Module specification: The SPI_MCP3202 module serves as a SPI controller specifically designed to manage SPI communication with an MCP3202 ADC. The module allows efficient conversion of analog signals to digital form, facilitated by the precise generation of necessary control signals like MOSI, SCK, and CS. It operates based on input signals - the system clock (`clk`), an enable signal (`EN`), and the data input from the ADC (`MISO`). The outputs include the MOSI and SCK signals for SPI communication, the digital conversion result (`o_DATA`), a chip select signal (`CS`), and a data valid signal (`DATA_VALID`). Internally, this module utilizes various registers and counters such as `SCK_counter`, `r_MOSI`, `r_DATA`, `r_STATE`, `r_CS`, `r_SCK_enable`, `r_DV`, and `sample_counter` to manage state transitions and data handling. The code includes distinct blocks handling the main operations: initialization and state management in response to the clock and enable signals, conditioning and handling of the SPI clock based on counters, and decision-making based on the internal state machine which processes states like DISABLE, TRANSMITTING, and RECEIVING. In each state, appropriate actions are taken to initiate communication, transmit commands, receive ADC data, and manage output signals accordingly.
