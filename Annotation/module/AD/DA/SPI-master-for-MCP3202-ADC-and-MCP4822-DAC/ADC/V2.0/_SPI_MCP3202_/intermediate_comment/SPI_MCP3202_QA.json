It manages the SPI communication, generating the necessary signals such as chip select (CS), serial clock (SCK), and master out slave in (MOSI) based on the internal state machine that transitions through disabling, transmitting, and receiving states. The module handles sampling the MISO (Master In Slave Out) line from the ADC during the receiving state to collect the digital conversion result, and it outputs this result on `o_DATA` once the conversion is complete, indicated by `DATA_VALID`. This module uses parameters for configuration and handles synchronization and timing for robust SPI communication with the ADC."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: clk, EN, MISO.\nExplanation:\n- `clk`: This is the clock input to the module, providing the timing reference for all operations within the SPI controller. It is essential for synchronizing the internal state machine and the generation of the SPI signals.\n- `EN`: This input enables the SPI communication when set high. It effectively starts the operation of the internal state machine, which handles the SPI transmission and reception processes.\n- `MISO`: Master In Slave Out - This is the data input from the MCP3202 ADC to the SPI controller. It carries the digital conversion result from the ADC to be read by this module during the receiving state.\n\nOutput ports: MOSI, SCK, o_DATA, CS, DATA_VALID.\nExplanation:\n- `MOSI`: Master Out Slave In - This output sends commands and data from the SPI controller to the MCP3202 ADC. It is a key component in initiating the ADC's conversion process and setting its parameters.\n- `SCK`: Serial Clock - This output provides the clock signal to the ADC for synchronizing the data transmission on MOSI and MISO lines. Its frequency and timing are crucial for the correct operation of the SPI communication.\n- `o_DATA`: This 12-bit output carries the digital conversion result read from the MCP3202 ADC. It becomes valid when the DATA_VALID signal is asserted, indicating that a new ADC conversion result is available.\n- `CS`: Chip Select - This output signal is used to select the MCP3202 ADC chip for communication. It is active low; the device is selected when CS is low and deselected when high.\n- `DATA_VALID`: This output is asserted high to indicate that a new ADC conversion result is available on `o_DATA`. It signals the completion of the SPI communication and data reception process."

It aids in generating the appropriate SCK frequency for SPI communication by counting the system clock cycles and toggling `SCK` at the right intervals.\n\n- `r_MOSI`: A register that holds the current bit value to be transmitted on the `MOSI` line. Its role is to buffer the bit that is currently being sent to the MCP3202 ADC during the transmitting state.\n\n- `r_DATA`: A 12-bit register that temporarily stores the conversion result received from the MCP3202 ADC via the `MISO` line. It aggregates the serial data into a parallel format before it is output on `o_DATA`.\n\n- `r_STATE`: A register that represents the current state of the internal state machine. It transitions through different states (`DISABLE`, `TRANSMITTING`, `RECEIVING`) to control the sequence of operations for SPI communication.\n\n- `r_CS`: A register used to control the `CS` (Chip Select) signal. It ensures that the MCP3202 ADC is selected or deselected at the correct times during the SPI communication cycle.\n\n- `r_SCK_enable`: This signal controls the enabling of the `SCK` clock output. It is used to ensure that `SCK` is only active during the specific periods of SPI communication, as dictated by the state machine.\n\n- `r_DV`: A register that holds the `DATA_VALID` signal state. It is set high to indicate that a valid conversion result is available on `o_DATA` and reset at the beginning of a new communication cycle or when not valid.\n\n- `sample_counter`: An integer counter used to manage timing and transitions within the SPI communication process. It increments on each clock cycle and is used to sequence through the various phases of transmitting and receiving, including enabling `r_SCK_enable`, managing `r_MOSI` for command and configuration bits, and capturing the conversion result on `r_DATA`."
