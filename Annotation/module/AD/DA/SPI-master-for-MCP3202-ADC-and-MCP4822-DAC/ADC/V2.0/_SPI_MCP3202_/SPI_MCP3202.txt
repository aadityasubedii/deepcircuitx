Module-level comment: The SPI_MCP3202 module interfaces with an MCP3202 ADC via SPI, managing analog-to-digital conversions. It controls SPI signals (MOSI, SCK, CS) based on an internal state machine that transitions through disabling, transmitting, and receiving states to capture conversion results. Utilizes registers and counters for timing and state management, achieving precise communication and data collection.
