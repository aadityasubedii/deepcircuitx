    "spec": "Module name: SPI_MCP3202. Module specification: The SPI_MCP3202 module serves as a SPI controller specifically designed to manage SPI communication with an MCP3202 ADC. The module allows efficient conversion of analog signals to digital form, facilitated by the precise generation of necessary control signals like MOSI, SCK, and CS. It operates based on input signals - the system clock (`clk`), an enable signal (`EN`), and the data input from the ADC (`MISO`). The outputs include the MOSI and SCK signals for SPI communication, the digital conversion result (`o_DATA`), a chip select signal (`CS`), and a data valid signal (`DATA_VALID`). Internally, this module utilizes various registers and counters such as `SCK_counter`, `r_MOSI`, `r_DATA`, `r_STATE`, `r_CS`, `r_SCK_enable`, `r_DV`, and `sample_counter` to manage state transitions and data handling. The code includes distinct blocks handling the main operations: initialization and state management in response to the clock and enable signals, conditioning and handling of the SPI clock based on counters, and decision-making based on the internal state machine which processes states like DISABLE, TRANSMITTING, and RECEIVING. In each state, appropriate actions are taken to initiate communication, transmit commands, receive ADC data, and manage output signals accordingly.",

It effectively starts the operation of the internal state machine, which handles the SPI transmission and reception processes.\n- `MISO`: Master In Slave Out - This is the data input from the MCP3202 ADC to the SPI controller. It carries the digital conversion result from the ADC to be read by this module during the receiving state.\n\nOutput ports: MOSI, SCK, o_DATA, CS, DATA_VALID.\nExplanation:\n- `MOSI`: Master Out Slave In - This output sends commands and data from the SPI controller to the MCP3202 ADC. It is a key component in initiating the ADC's conversion process and setting its parameters.\n- `SCK`: Serial Clock - This output provides the clock signal to the ADC for synchronizing the data transmission on MOSI and MISO lines. Its frequency and timing are crucial for the correct operation of the SPI communication.\n- `o_DATA`: This 12-bit output carries the digital conversion result read from the MCP3202 ADC. It becomes valid when the DATA_VALID signal is asserted, indicating that a new ADC conversion result is available.\n- `CS`: Chip Select - This output signal is used to select the MCP3202 ADC chip for communication.

It aids in generating the appropriate SCK frequency for SPI communication by counting the system clock cycles and toggling `SCK` at the right intervals.\n\n- `r_MOSI`: A register that holds the current bit value to be transmitted on the `MOSI` line.

The module allows efficient conversion of analog signals to digital form, facilitated by the precise generation of necessary control signals like MOSI, SCK, and CS. It operates based on input signals - the system clock (`clk`), an enable signal (`EN`), and the data input from the ADC (`MISO`). The outputs include the MOSI and SCK signals for SPI communication, the digital conversion result (`o_DATA`), a chip select signal (`CS`), and a data valid signal (`DATA_VALID`). Internally, this module utilizes various registers and counters such as `SCK_counter`, `r_MOSI`, `r_DATA`, `r_STATE`, `r_CS`, `r_SCK_enable`, `r_DV`, and `sample_counter` to manage state transitions and data handling. The code includes distinct blocks handling the main operations: initialization and state management in response to the clock and enable signals, conditioning and handling of the SPI clock based on counters, and decision-making based on the internal state machine which processes states like DISABLE, TRANSMITTING, and RECEIVING. In each state, appropriate actions are taken to initiate communication, transmit commands, receive ADC data, and manage output signals accordingly."
