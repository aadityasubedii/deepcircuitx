Module name: tb. Module specification: The Verilog module `tb` functions as a testbench dedicated to simulating the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication protocol, particularly targeting the interaction with an MCP3202 ADC (Analog to Digital Converter). This module encompasses input ports: `clk` (a clock signal that provides the timing reference for SPI operations), `EN` (an enable signal that when high, activates the SPI device), and `MISO` (Master Input Slave Output, simulates the data from the ADC to the master); and output ports: `MOSI` (Master Output Slave Input, typically carries data from master to slave), `SCK` (Serial Clock, synchronizes the data transmission), `CS` (Chip Select, selects the slave device), `DATA_VALID` (indicates the availability of valid data), and `o_DATA` (a 12-bit output transmitting the converted data from the ADC). Internal signals such as `clk`, `EN`, and `MISO` are primarily driven by the testbench whereas `MOSI`, `SCK`, and `CS` are monitored as outputs from the Device Under Test (DUT). The code is segmented into an always block that toggles the clock every 4 ns, and an initialization block setting initial conditions and simulating various states of `MISO` to replicate data transmission scenarios from the MCP3202 ADC, followed by a termination of the simulation. The `SPI_MCP3202` instance is parametrized by `SGL` and `ODD`, which configure the ADC operation mode (single-ended or differential, and channel selection). This testbench effectively ensures the SPI communication, timing, and data transfer functionalities are met as per specifications.
