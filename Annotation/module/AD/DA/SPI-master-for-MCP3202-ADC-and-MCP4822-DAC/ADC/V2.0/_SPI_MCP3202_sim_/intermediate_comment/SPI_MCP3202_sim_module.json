    "module": "Module-level comment: The `tb` module serves as a testbench for the SPI protocol with the MCP3202 ADC. It simulates SPI interactions using inputs `clk`, `EN`, and `MISO`, and observes outputs like `MOSI`, `SCK`, and `CS`. The core functionality is demonstrated by toggling `MISO` in various patterns, reflecting ADC data outputs under different conditions. This setup ensures proper timing, data integrity, and functionality of the SPI communication with the MCP3202 ADC."
