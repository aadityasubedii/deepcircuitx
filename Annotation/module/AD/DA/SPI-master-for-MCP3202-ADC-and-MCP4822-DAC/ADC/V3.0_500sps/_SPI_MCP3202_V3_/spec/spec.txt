Module name: SPI_MCP3202_V3. Module specification: The SPI_MCP3202_V3 module interfaces with an MCP3202 SPI analog to digital converter (ADC) using the SPI communication protocol. The module operates based on input parameters such as clock frequency (FCLK), single-ended input mode (SGL), and channel selection (ODD). The input ports include clk (the main clock signal), rst_n (active low reset), and miso (Master In Slave Out, receiving data from the ADC). The output ports consist of mosi (Master Out Slave In, sending data to the ADC), sck (serial clock for SPI), cs (chip select signal), data (12-bit output of received ADC data), and dv (data valid signal indicating new data availability). Internal signals such as r_state (managing state of the communication), r_tx_data (holding transmission data), and various counting and enabling signals (e.g., r_sck_en, r_sck_ctr) coordinate the data transmission, reception, and clock management. The code is structured into blocks handling initialization, data transmission, reception, and idling states, using a state machine with states INIT, TX, RX, and IDLE. Transition times and data transfers are managed by clock-driven counters and conditional checks that guide state transitions and data handling respecting SPI timing requirements.
