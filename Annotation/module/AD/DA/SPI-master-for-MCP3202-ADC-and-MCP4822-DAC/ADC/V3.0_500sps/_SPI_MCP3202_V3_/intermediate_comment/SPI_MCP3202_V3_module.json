    "module": "Module-level comment: The SPI_MCP3202_V3 module interfaces with an MCP3202 ADC over SPI, managing the communication protocol to read analog data. It implements a state machine to handle initialization, transmit configuration commands, receive ADC data, and ensure correct SPI timing using internal clocks and counters for sync with external ADC clock requirements."
