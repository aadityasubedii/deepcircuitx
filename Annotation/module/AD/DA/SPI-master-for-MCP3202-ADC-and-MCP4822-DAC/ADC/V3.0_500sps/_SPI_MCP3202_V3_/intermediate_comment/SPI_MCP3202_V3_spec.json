The module operates based on input parameters such as clock frequency (FCLK), single-ended input mode (SGL), and channel selection (ODD). The input ports include clk (the main clock signal), rst_n (active low reset), and miso (Master In Slave Out, receiving data from the ADC). The output ports consist of mosi (Master Out Slave In, sending data to the ADC), sck (serial clock for SPI), cs (chip select signal), data (12-bit output of received ADC data), and dv (data valid signal indicating new data availability). Internal signals such as r_state (managing state of the communication), r_tx_data (holding transmission data), and various counting and enabling signals (e.g., r_sck_en, r_sck_ctr) coordinate the data transmission, reception, and clock management. The code is structured into blocks handling initialization, data transmission, reception, and idling states, using a state machine with states INIT, TX, RX, and IDLE. Transition times and data transfers are managed by clock-driven counters and conditional checks that guide state transitions and data handling respecting SPI timing requirements.",

The parameters such as `FCLK`, `SGL`, and `ODD` configure operational details like clock frequency, single-ended input mode, and channel selection, respectively. The module controls and generates the necessary signals to perform sequences of SPI transactions which include setting the chip select (`cs`), communicating data (`mosi` for Master Out Slave In, `miso` for Master In Slave Out), and generating the serial clock (`sck`). The transactions follow a state machine with states INIT, TX, RX, and IDLE to manage initialization, data transmission, data reception, and idle/wait periods. The received data from the ADC is captured and output on a data bus (`data`) with a data valid signal (`dv`) indicating the availability of new data."

When asserted (low), it initializes the internal state machine and logic circuits to their start-up state ensuring a defined beginning state.\n- miso: Master In Slave Out. This input receives the serial data output from the ADC. Data from the ADC is received bit by bit on this line when the module is reading (receiving data).\n\nOutput ports: mosi, sck, cs, data, dv.\nExplanation:\n- mosi: Master Out Slave In. This output sends data serially to the ADC during a write operation. It carries command or configuration data from the FPGA or master controller to the ADC.\n- sck: Serial Clock. This output from the module drives the clock for SPI communication. It governs when data bits on the mosi and miso lines are sampled and shifted out.\n- cs: Chip Select. This active low output signal is used to select the ADC chip over the SPI bus allowing the initiation and termination of a communication session.\n- data: This 12-bit output carries the digital data received from the ADC after conversion, making it available to the rest of the system.\n- dv: Data Valid. This output signal indicates the availability of new valid data on the `data` output port, implying the end of a successful data reception period."

The states include INIT, TX, RX, and IDLE, each coordinating different phases of SPI interaction.\n- r_tx_data: This register holds the predetermined transmission data which is sent to the ADC. It primarily contains configuration bits such as MSBF (Most Significant Bit First), ODD (selecting the odd channel), SGL (Single-ended mode), and START bit for initiating communication.\n- r_mosi: This is a register which outputs the bit value to the `mosi` line based on the current bit being handled in the transmission or receiving cycle.\n- r_rx_data: A register that accumulates the incoming bits from the `miso` line during the reception cycle, forming the complete data word from the ADC.\n- r_cs: The chip select register that controls the `cs` signal for enabling/disabling the ADC communication.\n- r_dv: The data valid register that sets the `dv` output signal indicating the availability of new data from ADC.\n- r_tcsh_clk_cnts: A timer/counter that counts the clock cycles during certain states (like INIT and IDLE) to manage timing for transitions in the state machine.\n- r_tcsh_clk_cntr_en: This enables the timing counter (r_tcsh_clk_cnts) for transitions in the state machine between different cycles of operation.\n- r_clk_cnts_per_sck: This counter is used to divide the internal clock to generate the SPI clock (`sck`). It counts the cycles to manage the timing of the `sck` transitions.\n- r_sck_cntr: This counter keeps track of the total number of `sck` cycles that have occurred, which is crucial for determining when to send each bit on `mosi` or store bits from `miso`.\n- r_sck_en: A control signal that enables the counting of cycles for generating the `sck` signal, enabling or disabling SPI clock generation based on the module's state.\n"

The states include INIT, TX, RX, and IDLE, each coordinating different phases of SPI interaction.\n- r_tx_data: This register holds the predetermined transmission data which is sent to the ADC. It primarily contains configuration bits such as MSBF (Most Significant Bit First), ODD (selecting the odd channel), SGL (Single-ended mode), and START bit for initiating communication.\n- r_mosi: This is a register which outputs the bit value to the `mosi` line based on the current bit being handled in the transmission or receiving cycle.\n- r_rx_data: A register that accumulates the incoming bits from the `miso` line during the reception cycle, forming the complete data word from the ADC.\n- r_cs: The chip select register that controls the `cs` signal for enabling/disabling the ADC communication.\n- r_dv: The data valid register that sets the `dv` output signal indicating the availability of new data from ADC.\n- r_tcsh_clk_cnts: A timer/counter that counts the clock cycles during certain states (like INIT and IDLE) to manage timing for transitions in the state machine.\n- r_tcsh_clk_cntr_en: This enables the timing counter (r_tcsh_clk_cnts) for transitions in the state machine between different cycles of operation.\n- r_clk_cnts_per_sck: This counter is used to divide the internal clock to generate the SPI clock (`sck`). It counts the cycles to manage the timing of the `sck` transitions.\n- r_sck_cntr: This counter keeps track of the total number of `sck` cycles that have occurred, which is crucial for determining when to send each bit on `mosi` or store bits from `miso`.\n- r_sck_en: A control signal that enables the counting of cycles for generating the `sck` signal, enabling or disabling SPI clock generation based on the module's state.\n"

Module specification: The SPI_MCP3202_V3 module interfaces with an MCP3202 SPI analog to digital converter (ADC) using the SPI communication protocol. The module operates based on input parameters such as clock frequency (FCLK), single-ended input mode (SGL), and channel selection (ODD). The input ports include clk (the main clock signal), rst_n (active low reset), and miso (Master In Slave Out, receiving data from the ADC). The output ports consist of mosi (Master Out Slave In, sending data to the ADC), sck (serial clock for SPI), cs (chip select signal), data (12-bit output of received ADC data), and dv (data valid signal indicating new data availability). Internal signals such as r_state (managing state of the communication), r_tx_data (holding transmission data), and various counting and enabling signals (e.g., r_sck_en, r_sck_ctr) coordinate the data transmission, reception, and clock management. The code is structured into blocks handling initialization, data transmission, reception, and idling states, using a state machine with states INIT, TX, RX, and IDLE. Transition times and data transfers are managed by clock-driven counters and conditional checks that guide state transitions and data handling respecting SPI timing requirements."
