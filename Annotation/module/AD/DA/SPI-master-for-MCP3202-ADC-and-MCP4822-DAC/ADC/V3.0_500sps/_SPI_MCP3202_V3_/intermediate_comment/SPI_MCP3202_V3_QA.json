The parameters such as `FCLK`, `SGL`, and `ODD` configure operational details like clock frequency, single-ended input mode, and channel selection, respectively. The module controls and generates the necessary signals to perform sequences of SPI transactions which include setting the chip select (`cs`), communicating data (`mosi` for Master Out Slave In, `miso` for Master In Slave Out), and generating the serial clock (`sck`). The transactions follow a state machine with states INIT, TX, RX, and IDLE to manage initialization, data transmission, data reception, and idle/wait periods. The received data from the ADC is captured and output on a data bus (`data`) with a data valid signal (`dv`) indicating the availability of new data."

When asserted (low), it initializes the internal state machine and logic circuits to their start-up state ensuring a defined beginning state.\n- miso: Master In Slave Out. This input receives the serial data output from the ADC. Data from the ADC is received bit by bit on this line when the module is reading (receiving data).\n\nOutput ports: mosi, sck, cs, data, dv.\nExplanation:\n- mosi: Master Out Slave In. This output sends data serially to the ADC during a write operation. It carries command or configuration data from the FPGA or master controller to the ADC.\n- sck: Serial Clock. This output from the module drives the clock for SPI communication. It governs when data bits on the mosi and miso lines are sampled and shifted out.\n- cs: Chip Select. This active low output signal is used to select the ADC chip over the SPI bus allowing the initiation and termination of a communication session.\n- data: This 12-bit output carries the digital data received from the ADC after conversion, making it available to the rest of the system.\n- dv: Data Valid.
