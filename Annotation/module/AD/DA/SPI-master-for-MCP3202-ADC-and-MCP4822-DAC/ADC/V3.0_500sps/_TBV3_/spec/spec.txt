Module name: tb. Module specification: The "tb" module functions as a testbench specifically designed to validate and simulate the operation of an SPI-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) interface, likely modeled on the MCP3202 unit. The module leverages input ports: `clk`, a clock signal that synchronizes data transmission; `rst_n`, an active-low reset to initialize the state machine; and `miso`, the Master In Slave Out line used to receive data from the ADC. The output ports include: `mosi`, the Master Out Slave In line sending data to the ADC; `sck`, a Serial Clock for SPI communication; `cs`, a Chip Select to activate the ADC; `data`, for the digital output from the ADC; and `dv`, a Data Valid signal to indicate when the received data is ready for use. Internally, signals such as `r_tst_smpl`, a 12-bit register, are used to store and simulate a sample ADC value to test correct data alignment and SPI operations. The module includes an initialization section to set up the clock, reset, and starting states, followed by a transaction phase where the testbench stimulates the `miso` line with sample data bits in response to `cs` control, ensuring the ADC's operation and expected sequences were correct. The module concludes with a call to `$finish` to terminate the simulation after all tests are conducted.
