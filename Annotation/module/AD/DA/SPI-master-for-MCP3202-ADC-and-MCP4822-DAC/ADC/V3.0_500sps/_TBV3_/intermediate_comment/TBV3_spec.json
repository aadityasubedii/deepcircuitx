Module specification: The \"tb\" module functions as a testbench specifically designed to validate and simulate the operation of an SPI-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) interface, likely modeled on the MCP3202 unit. The module leverages input ports: `clk`, a clock signal that synchronizes data transmission; `rst_n`, an active-low reset to initialize the state machine; and `miso`, the Master In Slave Out line used to receive data from the ADC. The output ports include: `mosi`, the Master Out Slave In line sending data to the ADC; `sck`, a Serial Clock for SPI communication; `cs`, a Chip Select to activate the ADC; `data`, for the digital output from the ADC; and `dv`, a Data Valid signal to indicate when the received data is ready for use. Internally, signals such as `r_tst_smpl`, a 12-bit register, are used to store and simulate a sample ADC value to test correct data alignment and SPI operations. The module includes an initialization section to set up the clock, reset, and starting states, followed by a transaction phase where the testbench stimulates the `miso` line with sample data bits in response to `cs` control, ensuring the ADC's operation and expected sequences were correct. The module concludes with a call to `$finish` to terminate the simulation after all tests are conducted.",

This testbench includes initialization of the system clock `clk` and the active-low reset signal `rst_n`. It toggles the clock signal at a constant period and initializes and monitors the communication between the master (the testbench) and the slave device (the ADC modeled by the SPI_MCP3202_V3 instance).\n\nThe testbench sends a sample test value through the SPI interface by controlling the `miso` signal (Master In Slave Out) while observing the mosi (Master Out Slave In), sck (Serial Clock), cs (Chip Select), and data lines to ensure proper ADC operation such as the start bit, single-ended or differential mode selection, channel selection, and MSB or LSB first data transfer modes. After running through the test sequence, it finishes the simulation with the `$finish` command."
