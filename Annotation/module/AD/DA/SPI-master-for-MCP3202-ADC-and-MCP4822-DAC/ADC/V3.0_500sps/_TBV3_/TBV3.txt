Module-level comment: The `tb` module serves as a testbench for verifying an SPI-based ADC interface, specifically emulating MCP3202 operations. It simulates SPI transactions using `clk`, `rst_n`, and `miso` inputs, with `mosi`, `sck`, `cs`, `data`, and `dv` outputs. Internal signals, particularly `r_tst_smpl`, facilitate testing different operation modes and data integrity. Initialization and dynamic simulation phases systematically assess ADC communication and data transfer accuracy.
