Module name: SPI_state_machine. 
Module specification: The SPI_state_machine is a Verilog module designed to manage SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication through a state machine that transitions across four states: INITIALIZE, DISABLE, TRANSMITTING, and RECEIVING. It utilizes two input ports: 'clk' as the clock input for timing reference and synchronizing the SPI protocol, and 'MISO' (Master In Slave Out) for receiving data from the slave device. The module features five output ports: 'MOSI' (Master Out Slave In) for transmitting data to the slave device, 'SCK' as the serial clock for SPI communication, 'o_DATA' a 12-bit output data holding received data, 'CS' for chip select signal, and 'DATA_VALID' to indicate the availability of new data. Internal signals like 'SCK_counter', 'r_MOSI', 'r_DATA', 'r_STATE', 'r_CS', 'r_SCK_enable', 'r_DV', and 'sample_counter' are employed for various purposes such as counting the clock cycles, storing current bit value for transmission, accumulating received data, tracking the current state of the machine, controlling the Chip Select and Serial Clock enable signals, indicating the validity of received data, and referencing timing within the state machine, respectively. The code is structured into several always blocks synchronized on the positive edge of the clock signal, each handling different aspects of the SPI communication process such as state transitions, SCK generation based on internal counters, and data transmission/reception based on the current state and timing references provided by 'sample_counter'. This organized approach allows the module to efficiently perform SPI communication by sequentially sending control signals and receiving data while maintaining synchronization through the state machine mechanics.
