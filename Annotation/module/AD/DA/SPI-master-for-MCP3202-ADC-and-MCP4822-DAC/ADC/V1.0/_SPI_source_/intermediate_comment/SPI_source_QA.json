It operates across four primary states: INITIALIZE, DISABLE, TRANSMITTING, and RECEIVING. In the INITIALIZE state, the module prepares for transmission by resetting necessary control signals and counts cycles to proceed to the next state. In the DISABLE state, it waits a certain number of cycles before initiating the transmission. During TRANSMITTING, it sequentially sends control signals (START, SGL, ODD, MSBF) to a peripheral device via MOSI (Master Out Slave In). In the RECEIVING state, the module collects data from the peripheral through the MISO (Master In Slave Out) line over multiple clock cycles, setting bits of the output data register accordingly. The state machine continually sequences through these states based on the count of system clock cycles, controlled by the 'sample_counter', to maintain synchronous data transmission and reception. The module outputs the received data, a data valid signal indicating the availability of new data, and control signals to manage the SPI communication."

It is the SPI data input into the master device from the slave device. This line is used by the module to receive data from the SPI peripheral during the RECEIVING state.\n\nOutput ports: MOSI, SCK, o_DATA, CS, DATA_VALID.\nExplanation: \n- MOSI: Master Out Slave In. It is the SPI data output from the master device to the slave device. This line is used by the module to send commands or data to the SPI peripheral during the TRANSMITTING state.\n- SCK: Serial Clock. It provides the clock signal for the SPI communication to the peripheral devices. It is generated and controlled internally by the module, based on state and internal counters.\n- o_DATA: Output Data (12-bit). It holds the data that has been received from the SPI peripheral. This data becomes valid when the RECEIVING state has completed a full cycle of data reception.\n- CS: Chip Select. This signal is used to enable or disable the slave device with which the master communicates. It goes low (active) when the module is ready to transmit or receive data, and goes high (inactive) at all other times.\n- DATA_VALID: Data Valid.

It is used to toggle the SCK signal at the correct rate.\n  \n- r_MOSI: This register stores the current bit value to be transmitted on the MOSI line.
