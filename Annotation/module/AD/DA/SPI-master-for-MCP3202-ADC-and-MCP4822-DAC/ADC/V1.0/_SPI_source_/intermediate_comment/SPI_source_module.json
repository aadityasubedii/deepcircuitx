    "module": "Module-level comment: The SPI_state_machine manages SPI communication through a state machine with states INITIALIZE, DISABLE, TRANSMITTING, and RECEIVING. It synchronizes data exchange with the slave device using input and output ports for clock (clk), data (MOSI/MISO), and control (CS, DATA_VALID). Internally, it employs counters and registers to handle state transitions and data transfer while ensuring correct SPI protocol timing."
