    "spec": "Module name: SPI_state_machine. \nModule specification: The SPI_state_machine is a Verilog module designed to manage SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication through a state machine that transitions across four states: INITIALIZE, DISABLE, TRANSMITTING, and RECEIVING. It utilizes two input ports: 'clk' as the clock input for timing reference and synchronizing the SPI protocol, and 'MISO' (Master In Slave Out) for receiving data from the slave device. The module features five output ports: 'MOSI' (Master Out Slave In) for transmitting data to the slave device, 'SCK' as the serial clock for SPI communication, 'o_DATA' a 12-bit output data holding received data, 'CS' for chip select signal, and 'DATA_VALID' to indicate the availability of new data. Internal signals like 'SCK_counter', 'r_MOSI', 'r_DATA', 'r_STATE', 'r_CS', 'r_SCK_enable', 'r_DV', and 'sample_counter' are employed for various purposes such as counting the clock cycles, storing current bit value for transmission, accumulating received data, tracking the current state of the machine, controlling the Chip Select and Serial Clock enable signals, indicating the validity of received data, and referencing timing within the state machine, respectively. The code is structured into several always blocks synchronized on the positive edge of the clock signal, each handling different aspects of the SPI communication process such as state transitions, SCK generation based on internal counters, and data transmission/reception based on the current state and timing references provided by 'sample_counter'. This organized approach allows the module to efficiently perform SPI communication by sequentially sending control signals and receiving data while maintaining synchronization through the state machine mechanics.",

In the INITIALIZE state, the module prepares for transmission by resetting necessary control signals and counts cycles to proceed to the next state. In the DISABLE state, it waits a certain number of cycles before initiating the transmission. During TRANSMITTING, it sequentially sends control signals (START, SGL, ODD, MSBF) to a peripheral device via MOSI (Master Out Slave In). In the RECEIVING state, the module collects data from the peripheral through the MISO (Master In Slave Out) line over multiple clock cycles, setting bits of the output data register accordingly.

This line is used by the module to receive data from the SPI peripheral during the RECEIVING state.\n\nOutput ports: MOSI, SCK, o_DATA, CS, DATA_VALID.\nExplanation: \n- MOSI: Master Out Slave In.

It is used to toggle the SCK signal at the correct rate.\n  \n- r_MOSI: This register stores the current bit value to be transmitted on the MOSI line.

It transitions between INITIALIZE, DISABLE, TRANSMITTING, and RECEIVING states based on certain conditions and timings.\n\n- r_CS: This register controls the Chip Select (CS) signal. It's used to enable or disable the SPI communication with the slave device, where a `0` activates the slave, and `1` deactivates it.\n\n- r_SCK_enable: This control signal determines whether the SCK clock should be generated or not. It\u2019s activated when the state machine is in the TRANSMITTING or RECEIVING state and is turned off otherwise.\n\n- r_DV: This register holds the Data Valid (DATA_VALID) signal.

It is used to toggle the SCK signal at the correct rate.\n  \n- r_MOSI: This register stores the current bit value to be transmitted on the MOSI line. It is updated as per the SPI protocol requirements during the TRANSMITTING state.\n  \n- r_DATA: A 12-bit register that accumulates the data received from the MISO line during the RECEIVING state. Once all bits are received, the data is held here until ready to be output as o_DATA.\n\n- r_STATE: A 2-bit register representing the current state of the SPI state machine. It transitions between INITIALIZE, DISABLE, TRANSMITTING, and RECEIVING states based on certain conditions and timings.\n\n- r_CS: This register controls the Chip Select (CS) signal. It's used to enable or disable the SPI communication with the slave device, where a `0` activates the slave, and `1` deactivates it.\n\n- r_SCK_enable: This control signal determines whether the SCK clock should be generated or not. It\u2019s activated when the state machine is in the TRANSMITTING or RECEIVING state and is turned off otherwise.\n\n- r_DV: This register holds the Data Valid (DATA_VALID) signal. It is set to `1` when valid data is present in the r_DATA register and can be read as o_DATA; it is cleared to `0` otherwise or during data transmission and reception.\n\n- sample_counter: A 12-bit register used as a timing reference within the state machine. It counts the clock cycles to determine when to transition states and when to set or reset signals throughout the SPI communication process."

It utilizes two input ports: 'clk' as the clock input for timing reference and synchronizing the SPI protocol, and 'MISO' (Master In Slave Out) for receiving data from the slave device. The module features five output ports: 'MOSI' (Master Out Slave In) for transmitting data to the slave device, 'SCK' as the serial clock for SPI communication, 'o_DATA' a 12-bit output data holding received data, 'CS' for chip select signal, and 'DATA_VALID' to indicate the availability of new data. Internal signals like 'SCK_counter', 'r_MOSI', 'r_DATA', 'r_STATE', 'r_CS', 'r_SCK_enable', 'r_DV', and 'sample_counter' are employed for various purposes such as counting the clock cycles, storing current bit value for transmission, accumulating received data, tracking the current state of the machine, controlling the Chip Select and Serial Clock enable signals, indicating the validity of received data, and referencing timing within the state machine, respectively. The code is structured into several always blocks synchronized on the positive edge of the clock signal, each handling different aspects of the SPI communication process such as state transitions, SCK generation based on internal counters, and data transmission/reception based on the current state and timing references provided by 'sample_counter'. This organized approach allows the module to efficiently perform SPI communication by sequentially sending control signals and receiving data while maintaining synchronization through the state machine mechanics."
