Module-level comment: The 'tb' module simulates a testbench for the `SPI_state_machine`, generating a clock (`clk`) and toggling `MISO` to verify SPI functionalities. It employs an always block for the 8 ns clock cycle and an initial block for scripting `MISO`'s sequential states to evaluate responses from `MOSI`, `SCK`, `CS`, `DATA_VALID`, and `o_DATA` outputs, thereby ensuring the machine's correct behavior under predefined conditions.
