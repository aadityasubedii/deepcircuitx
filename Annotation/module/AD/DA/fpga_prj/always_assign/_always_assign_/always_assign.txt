Module-level comment: This Verilog module performs signal processing with sequential and combinational logic, employing flip-flop storage and arithmetic operations. It uses a clock (`clk`) and an active-low reset (`rst_n`) for synchronization, plus inputs `a` and `d` to compute the output `c` (a+d) and conditionally assign it or `a+d` to `q`. The module contains two always blocks for handling `q` under clock and reset conditions, but faces a design issue with `q` being driven by both blocks, leading to synthesis errors that need correction.
