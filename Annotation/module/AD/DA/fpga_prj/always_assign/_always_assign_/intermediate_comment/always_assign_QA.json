            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: `q`, `c`.\nExplanation: \n\n- `q`: In the provided code snippet, `q` appears to be an internal signal that flip-flops or storage elements should drive. It acts as an output register that is supposed to capture and hold values under certain conditions. Upon the active-low asynchronous reset `rst_n` being asserted, it is cleared to 0. Otherwise, one block of code suggests that `q` should capture the sum of `a` and `d` with every rising edge of the `clk`. However, there is a conflict because another always block is trying to assign `c` to `q` during the positive clock edge as well, which is typically not allowed in synthesizable Verilog unless conditions are mutually exclusive. It's important to note that `q` cannot function as intended in the current form due to these conflicting assignments.\n\n- `c`: This signal is defined as a combinational output through the continuous assignment `assign c = a + d;`. It sums the values of `a` and `d` and reflects the result immediately, without any clock edge dependency. The resulting signal `c` is intended to be used elsewhere in the module, although it's incorrectly being used to drive `q` synchronously in an always block, causing a conflict.\n\nGiven the apparent mistakes in the code, `q` cannot serve as a proper internal signal unless the conflicts are resolved to adhere to synthesizable practices. `c` functions as an internal signal forming a part of combinational logic that can be used as part of more complex expressions or as an input to sequential elements in a correctly written module."
