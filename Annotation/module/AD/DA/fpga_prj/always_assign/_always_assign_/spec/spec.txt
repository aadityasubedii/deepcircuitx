Module name: UnnamedModule
Module specification: This Verilog module appears to be intended for signal processing using sequential and combinational logic, although it contains a significant design flaw. The module operates with two primary inputs: the clock signal `clk` and the active-low asynchronous reset `rst_n`. Additionally, it employs two data inputs `a` and `d`. The outputs defined are `q` and `c`. `q` is designed to function as a flip-flop output which stores either the sum of `a` and `d` or the value of `c`, based on the clock `clk`. However, there is a conflict as `q` is driven by two distinct always blocks under similar conditions, leading to synthesis issues. The output `c` is a combinational logic output driven directly by the sum of `a` and `d` via a continuous assignment statement, thereby updating instantly as either input changes. Internally, the `q` and `c` signals play dual roles as both internal and output signals, with `q` being intended for storage and state representation and `c` for real-time computation. The module contains two always blocks, both sensitive to the `clk` and `rst_n`: the first block conditions the output `q` to `0` or `a + d`, while the second block redundantly conditions `q` to `0` or `c`, resulting in a critical design error that needs resolution for proper function.
