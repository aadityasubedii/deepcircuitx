    "module": "Module-level comment: The `my_led` module controls an LED blinking pattern with a clock-driven, two-stage counter system on a `clk` signal and `rst_n` reset. The `cnt0` counter increments until it matches the dynamically set threshold `x-1`, driving the 4-bit `cnt1` counter. `cnt1`'s value defines `x`, dictating `cnt0`'s next max count, which influences the LED's on/off toggling at specific count intervals, creating a variable blink sequence."
