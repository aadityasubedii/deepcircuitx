Module name: my_led. 

Module specification: The `my_led` module is designed to control an LED using dynamic timing intervals determined by two counters, `cnt0` and `cnt1`, utilizing an external clock signal and an active-low reset. It operates on an input clock (`clk`) to synchronize internal operations and an active-low reset (`rst_n`) to initialize the system states. The sole output, `led`, reflects the state of the LED, which blinks based on the counters' sequences. Internally, `cnt0` is a 29-bit counter that increments every clock cycle, controlled by the signal `add_cnt0`, until it reaches the value `x-1` marked by `end_cnt0`, which then triggers its reset. `cnt1` is a 4-bit counter that increments when `cnt0` completes a cycle (indicated by `end_cnt0`) and helps adjust `x`, affecting `cnt0`'s target for the next cycle. The value x is dynamically set from 100 million to 500 million, depending on `cnt1`'s value, changing the period `cnt0` counts for each cycle. The LED state toggles based on `cnt0` reaching specific values, turning off briefly when `cnt0` hits 50,000,000-1 and resetting to on when `cnt0` completes its count defined by `x-1`. This tightly coupled interaction between counters allows the LED to display a varying pattern of blinks, governed by simple yet dynamically adjusting conditions within the module.
