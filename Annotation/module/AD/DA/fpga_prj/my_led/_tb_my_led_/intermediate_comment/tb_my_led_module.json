    "module": "Module-level comment: The `tb_my_led` module serves as a testbench for the `my_led` sub-module, providing a clock and a reset signal to simulate its operation. It generates a periodic clock (`clk`) based on the `CYCLE` parameter and implements a reset sequence (`rst_n`) before allowing normal operation. This enables validation of the `my_led` behavior, particularly the output `led` signal, under controlled test conditions."
