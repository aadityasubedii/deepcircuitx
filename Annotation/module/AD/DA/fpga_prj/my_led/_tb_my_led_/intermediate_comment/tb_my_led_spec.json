    "spec": "Module name: tb_my_led. \n\nModule specification: The `tb_my_led` module is designed as a testbench primarily for validating the functionality of the `my_led` sub-module. This module orchestrates the provision of a clock signal (`clk`) and a reset signal (`rst_n`) to emulate operational conditions for `my_led`. The input ports consist of `clk` and `rst_n`, where `clk` facilitates timing and sequencing, being critical for the synchronization of operations within `my_led`. The `rst_n` signal is pivotal for initializing the module to a known, stable state, effectively resetting it before normal operation commences. The sole output port, `led`, is driven by the `my_led` sub-module to indicate state or result, heavily dependent on internal logic which is influenced by both `clk` and `rst_n`. Internally, the `clk` signal is generated and toggled at an interval defined by half of the `CYCLE` parameter's value, establishing the simulation's timing framework. The `rst_n` signal is initially cleared (`0`) to reset the system, then set to `1` after a predetermined period (`10 * CYCLE`), marking the preparation phase's conclusion and the start of usual operations. The behavior or effect on the `led` signal, though not explicated in detail, is expected to reflect the internal processing outcomes of `my_led` based on the inputs provided. The code is divided into major blocks, including signal initializations for `clk` and `rst_n` to simulate typical startup conditions. `clk` is continuously toggled to mimic operational clock pulses, while `rst_n` undergoes a two-step initialization sequence to reset and then enable normal module operations. This structured approach in `tb_my_led` facilitates thorough testing of the `my_led` module under conditions that closely resemble actual operation, both in terms of timing and system state initialization.",
