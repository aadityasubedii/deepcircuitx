    "spec": "Module name: my_led_4_flash.\nModule specification: The \"my_led_4_flash\" module utilizes an FPGA or similar hardware to control a pattern in which four LEDs (led0, led1, led2, led3) are toggled to create a visual flashing effect. It has two input ports: 'clk' as the system clock that drives the internal counters and manages the timing of LED toggling, and 'rst_n', an active low reset signal that initializes the module and sets the LEDs to an initial state. The output ports consist of 'led0', 'led1', 'led2', and 'led3', where each corresponds to controlling the on and off states of individual LEDs. Internally, the module employs two counters: 'cnt0', a 26-bit counter, that generates a base timing reference by counting up to 50,000,000 cycles, and 'cnt1', a 4-bit counter, providing sub-timings by counting up to 14. The control flags 'add_cnt0', 'end_cnt0', 'add_cnt1', and 'end_cnt1' are used to manage the counting logic, indicating when to increment the counters and when they have completed a cycle. The code consists of sequential blocks that define the behavior of the counters on every clock edge and reset signal, as well as combinational blocks that assign values to control flags and manage the toggling of LEDs to create the desired flashing sequence.",

The module operates by counting clock cycles to determine when to toggle each of the LEDs on or off at specific intervals. The `cnt0` counts up to a pre-defined value (50,000,000 cycles) to create a base timing reference, and `cnt1` counts up to 14 to create sub-timings. Each LED is toggled at different intervals based upon these counts to create a sequence of flashing lights. The sequence and timing of the LEDs depend on these counters resetting and reaching predefined threshold values, thus creating a visual flashing pattern on the hardware. The entire operation is sensitive to the system clock (`clk`) and a reset signal (`rst_n`) which initializes the counters and sets the LEDs to an initial state."

It is a continuous signal used to drive the operation of counters and the sequential logic within the module. Each rising edge of the clock is used to advance counters and potentially update the state of the outputs based on the logic coded in the module.\n- `rst_n`: This is the reset input, active low. It is used to initialize or reset the module to a known state. When `rst_n` is low, it resets all internal counters (`cnt0`, `cnt1`) and sets all LEDs (`led0`, `led1`, `led2`, `led3`) to their initial state.\n\nOutput ports: `led0`, `led1`, `led2`, `led3`.\nExplanation:\n- `led0`, `led1`, `led2`, `led3`: These are the output ports connected to external LEDs. Each output controls one LED. The outputs toggle between on and off states at intervals defined by internal counters (`cnt0`, `cnt1`). The toggling creates a visual flashing pattern on the LEDs based on the specified timing and sequence logic implemented in the module."

It counts the clock cycles up to a predefined value (50,000,000 - 1). Its main purpose is to create a long delay to serve as a base timing reference for the flashing pattern of the LEDs.\n  \n- `add_cnt0`: This signal is a control flag that indicates when to increment `cnt0`. In this module, it is always set to 1, meaning `cnt0` is incremented with every clock cycle as long as `add_cnt0` is enabled.\n  \n- `end_cnt0`: This signal indicates when `cnt0` has reached its maximum count value (50,000,000 - 1). When `end_cnt0` is high, it triggers the reset of `cnt0` back to 0, creating a cyclic timer effect. This effectively marks the completion of a single cycle of the base timing reference.\n  \n- `cnt1`: This is a 4-bit counter that counts up to 14 to provide sub-timings within a cycle defined by `cnt0`. It is used to control when each of the LEDs is toggled on or off, creating the intended sequence of flashes.\n  \n- `add_cnt1`: This signal controls when to increment `cnt1`. It is enabled (`high`) when `end_cnt0` is true, meaning `cnt1` starts counting whenever `cnt0` completes a cycle. This links the sub-timings directly to the main timing cycle provided by `cnt0`.\n  \n- `end_cnt1`: This signal indicates when `cnt1` has reached its maximum count value (14 - 1). Similar to `end_cnt0`, it triggers a reset of `cnt1` back to 0 when high, completing a sub-timing cycle and preparing for the next sequence of LED flashes."
