Module-level comment: The "my_led_4_flash" module creates a sequential flashing pattern for 4 LEDs based on clock cycle counts. Utilizing a 26-bit 'cnt0' for long delays and a 4-bit 'cnt1' for sub-timing, it toggles LEDs at intervals dictated by these counters. Upon reset, counters and LEDs are initialized. The implementation employs always blocks for synchronous counting and conditional LED state changes. Combinational logic determines the end of counting cycles and incrementation flags.
