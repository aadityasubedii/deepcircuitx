Module name: my_led_4_flash.
Module specification: The "my_led_4_flash" module utilizes an FPGA or similar hardware to control a pattern in which four LEDs (led0, led1, led2, led3) are toggled to create a visual flashing effect. It has two input ports: 'clk' as the system clock that drives the internal counters and manages the timing of LED toggling, and 'rst_n', an active low reset signal that initializes the module and sets the LEDs to an initial state. The output ports consist of 'led0', 'led1', 'led2', and 'led3', where each corresponds to controlling the on and off states of individual LEDs. Internally, the module employs two counters: 'cnt0', a 26-bit counter, that generates a base timing reference by counting up to 50,000,000 cycles, and 'cnt1', a 4-bit counter, providing sub-timings by counting up to 14. The control flags 'add_cnt0', 'end_cnt0', 'add_cnt1', and 'end_cnt1' are used to manage the counting logic, indicating when to increment the counters and when they have completed a cycle. The code consists of sequential blocks that define the behavior of the counters on every clock edge and reset signal, as well as combinational blocks that assign values to control flags and manage the toggling of LEDs to create the desired flashing sequence.
