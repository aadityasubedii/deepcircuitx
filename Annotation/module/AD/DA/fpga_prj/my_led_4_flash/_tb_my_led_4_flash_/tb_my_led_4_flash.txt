Module-level comment: The 'tb_my_led_4_flash' is a testbench for assessing the 'my_led_4_flash' module, which governs four LEDs. It leverages inputs 'clk' for timing and 'rst_n' for reset conditions, with outputs 'led0' to 'led3' indicating LED states. Implementation involves clock signal toggling every half 'CYCLE' and a reset simulation after ten cycles. This setup validates the correct LED behavior under controlled test conditions.
