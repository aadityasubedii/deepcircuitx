It includes a clock signal 'clk' that toggles every half cycle (defined by the parameter 'CYCLE') and a reset signal 'rst_n' that is held low initially and then set high after a certain period (10 cycles of 'CYCLE') to simulate a reset condition. The outputs of the unit under test (my_led_4_flash) are connected to four wires representing the four LEDs. This setup is used to observe and verify the behavior of the LEDs under test conditions."

It is a digital signal that oscillates between a high and a low state, effectively driving the timing of the module's operation. The clock signal is essential for synchronous designs, as it ensures that all changes in the signals or data occur at defined times relative to the clock edges.\n- rst_n: This is the reset input to the module, active low. It is used to initialize or reset the state of the module to a known condition. When 'rst_n' is low, it indicates that the module should reset its internal state. After being held low for a specified period, it is brought high (de-asserted) to allow normal operation.\n\nOutput ports:\n- led0\n- led1\n- led2\n- led3\n\nExplanation:\n- led0 to led3: These are the outputs of the module, each connected to an individual LED (Light Emitting Diode). These outputs control the on or off state of the LEDs. Depending on the implementation within the module 'my_led_4_flash', these outputs will likely be driven high or low to turn the corresponding LEDs on or off. The operation of these outputs is determined by the logic within the 'my_led_4_flash' module, which is under test in this testbench. They are essential for observing and verifying the functionality of the LED control logic implemented in the 'my_led_4_flash' module."
