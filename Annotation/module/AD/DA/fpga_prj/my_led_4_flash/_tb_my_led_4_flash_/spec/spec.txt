Module name: tb_my_led_4_flash. Module specification: The 'tb_my_led_4_flash' module is a testbench designed to evaluate the functionality of the 'my_led_4_flash' module, which is presumed to manage the operation of four LEDs. Its primary inputs include 'clk' (clock input) and 'rst_n' (active-low reset input), which orchestrate the timing and initialization/reset of the module's operations, respectively. The output ports are 'led0' to 'led3', each corresponding to one of the four LEDs, indicating the on or off state as controlled by the 'my_led_4_flash' module. Internally, the testbench utilizes the 'clk', 'rst_n', and 'led0' to 'led3' signals. The 'clk' signal, driven by a parameter 'CYCLE' to toggle every half cycle, ensures synchronized operation within the module. 'rst_n' facilitates testing of the module's response to reset conditions by being initially low, then set high after ten cycles. The 'led0' to 'led3' signals serve as inspection points to validate the LED control logic of the 'my_led_4_flash' module. The Verilog code is structured into blocks including module instantiation of 'my_led_4_flash', initial blocks for generating the 'clk' signal and simulating a reset scenario using 'rst_n'. These elements work cohesively to simulate, observe, and verify the targeted behaviors of the 'my_led_4_flash' module, particularly its management of LED states under varying conditions, ensuring a thorough evaluation of its design and functionality.
