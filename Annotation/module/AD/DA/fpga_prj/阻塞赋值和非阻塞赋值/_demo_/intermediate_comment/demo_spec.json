    "spec": "Module name: ArithmeticOperationModule.\n\nModule specification: The ArithmeticOperationModule is designed to perform specific arithmetic operations involving input and output signals within a synchronous digital system. The inputs to this module include the signal `a`, which acts as a primary data operand for arithmetic calculations, the clock signal `clk` used for synchronizing state updates, and the reset signal `rst_n`, an asynchronous active-low reset intended to initialize the module's internal state. The outputs of the module are signals `c` and `d`; `c` reflects the value of `a` and `d` computes the sum of `a` and `c`. Inside the module, `a`, `c`, and `d` also serve as internal signals where `a` is the operand in calculations, `c` mirrors `a` in two different forms \u2013 immediately and upon each clock cycle when not in reset state, and `d` accumulates the ongoing computation of `a` and `c`. The module consists of two main blocks: the first always block handles combinational logic, continuously calculating outputs `c` and `d` as the immediate reflection and sum of `a` and `c`, respectively. The second block implements sequential logic, sensitive to the positive edges of `clk` and negative edges of `rst_n`. Here, upon exiting reset, `c` and `d` are updated with the value of `a` and the sum of `c` and `a` on clock edges, ensuring the module's arithmetic operation is performed in sync with the system's clock, allowing for the dynamic updating and storage of the results based on the timing signals.",

The second always block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock `clk` and the negative edge of the reset signal `rst_n`. This block describes a sequential logic where, upon the reset condition (`!rst_n`), the actions are not defined within the provided snippet (as indicated by the empty statements). In the normal operation (else clause), it registers the value of `a` into `c` and the sum of `c` and `a` into `d` on the rising edge of the clock.

Nevertheless, based on conventional Verilog coding practices and the content of the two always blocks, we can make the following assumptions regarding potential inputs and outputs:\n\nAssumed input ports: `a`, `clk`, `rst_n`.\nExplanation:\n- `a`: This seems to be a data input signal or operand used in the arithmetic operations within the module.\n- `clk`: This is the clock input signal that synchronizes the state updates of the sequential logic; it drives the computation of the outputs `c` and `d` on the positive edge.\n- `rst_n`: This is the asynchronous active-low reset input which, when asserted (i.e., driven low), is intended to reset the internal state of the module. However, the actual reset behavior isn't specified in the code as the reset condition section is empty.\n\nAssumed output ports: `c`, `d`.\nExplanation:\n- `c`: This is an output signal that is assigned the value of input `a` both in combinational logic for immediate updates and in sequential logic to update its value on each positive clock edge when the reset is not active.\n- `d`: This is an output signal which seems to compute and store the sum of `a` and `c`. In the combinational block, it's an immediate operation, while in the sequential block, it's updated on the positive edge of the clock signal if the reset is not asserted.\n\nIt is important to note that without the explicit definition of the module ports in the actual code, we cannot definitively identify the true port directions (input/output). In a typical module, signals `clk` and `rst_n` would be inputs, while `a` could be an input or an in-out signal depending on the wider context of the design, and `c` and `d` would likely be outputs or internal registers, depending on whether they are accessible from outside the module."

It is used directly in arithmetic operations for calculating `c` and `d`. Its role is to act as a value that is being manipulated and processed within the module's logic.\n\n- `c`: This signal is used both in combinational and sequential logic within the module. In the combinational part, `c` is set equal to `a`, which suggests that it might be used for immediate reflection of `a`'s value within the module's logic. In the sequential part, `c` is assigned (non-blocking assignment) the value of `a` at the positive edge of the clock when the reset (`rst_n`) is not asserted, indicating that `c` acts as a registered version of `a` that holds its value across clock cycles.\n\n- `d`: This signal is also used in both combinational and sequential parts. In the combinational logic, it represents the immediate sum of `c` and `a`. In the sequential logic, it is updated (non-blocking assignment) to hold the sum of `c` and `a` with each positive clock edge when reset is not asserted. The signal `d` seems to serve as an accumulator or a register that stores the ongoing sum computation across clock cycles.\n\nIn summary, `a` is the primary value being manipulated, `c` mirrors `a` in both immediate and registered forms, and `d` accumulates computations involving `a` and `c`."
