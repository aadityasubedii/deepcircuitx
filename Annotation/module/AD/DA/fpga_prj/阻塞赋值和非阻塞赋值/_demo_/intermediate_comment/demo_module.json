    "module": "Module-level comment: ArithmeticOperationModule implements synchronous arithmetic operations. It has an input 'a' and outputs 'c' and 'd', with 'c' mirroring 'a' and 'd' holding their sum. Combinational logic ensures immediate reflection of 'a' while sequential logic updates outputs on clock edges, respecting the active-low reset."
