Module name: ArithmeticOperationModule.

Module specification: The ArithmeticOperationModule is designed to perform specific arithmetic operations involving input and output signals within a synchronous digital system. The inputs to this module include the signal `a`, which acts as a primary data operand for arithmetic calculations, the clock signal `clk` used for synchronizing state updates, and the reset signal `rst_n`, an asynchronous active-low reset intended to initialize the module's internal state. The outputs of the module are signals `c` and `d`; `c` reflects the value of `a` and `d` computes the sum of `a` and `c`. Inside the module, `a`, `c`, and `d` also serve as internal signals where `a` is the operand in calculations, `c` mirrors `a` in two different forms â€“ immediately and upon each clock cycle when not in reset state, and `d` accumulates the ongoing computation of `a` and `c`. The module consists of two main blocks: the first always block handles combinational logic, continuously calculating outputs `c` and `d` as the immediate reflection and sum of `a` and `c`, respectively. The second block implements sequential logic, sensitive to the positive edges of `clk` and negative edges of `rst_n`. Here, upon exiting reset, `c` and `d` are updated with the value of `a` and the sum of `c` and `a` on clock edges, ensuring the module's arithmetic operation is performed in sync with the system's clock, allowing for the dynamic updating and storage of the results based on the timing signals.
