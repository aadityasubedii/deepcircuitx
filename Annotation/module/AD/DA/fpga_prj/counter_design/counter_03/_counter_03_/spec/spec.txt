Module name: CascadingCounters

Module specification: The CascadingCounters module is a digital system designed to implement a sequence of two 3-bit counters (`cnt0` and `cnt1`) which increase sequentially under specific conditions and can be reset. The module operates under a provided clock signal (`clk`) and supports asynchronous reset through an active-low reset signal (`rst_n`). A flag (`flag`) and enable signal (`en`) are used as input controls that determine counting logic, while a data output signal (`dout`) represents the module's external interface.

The input ports include:
- `clk`: The clock signal which synchronizes the counting.
- `rst_n`: An active-low asynchronous reset signal that reinitializes internal states.
- `flag`: An internal signal used as a condition for incrementing `cnt0`.
- `en`: Enables setting of the `flag`.

The output port is:
- `dout`: Indicates when `cnt0` has started counting from 0 and resets when `cnt0` completes its count cycle.

Internal signals consist of:
- `cnt0` and `cnt1`: 3-bit registers acting as primary and secondary counters.
- `add_cnt0` and `add_cnt1`: Control whether respective counters should increment.
- `end_cnt0` and `end_cnt1`: Determine whether respective counters have reached their maximum value (2) and trigger resets or additional counting logic.

The code is organized into several always blocks and assign statements:
- One always block for the `cnt0` logic, including its reset and incrementing behavior.
- One for the `cnt1` logic, mirroring that of `cnt0` but sequenced after `cnt0`'s maximum count is reached.
- Another always block for the `flag` handling, which sets and resets based on the `en` input and the `end_cnt1` signal.
- Finally, one always block for `dout` output logic, which indicates the start of `cnt0` and resets upon the completion of the `cnt0` count cycle.

This module could serve as a part of a larger system where cascaded counters are necessary for timing or sequential control operations, providing a basic, yet fundamental, counting and control mechanism.
