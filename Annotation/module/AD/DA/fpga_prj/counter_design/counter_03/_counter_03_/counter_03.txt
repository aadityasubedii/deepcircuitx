Module-level comment: The CascadingCounters module consists of two 3-bit counters (cnt0, cnt1) that sequentially increment with clk. It uses asynchronous reset (rst_n), an enable signal (en) to set a flag for counting, and outputs a signal (dout) when cnt0 starts counting. Internal logic dictates reset conditions and counting progression based on flag and counter values.
