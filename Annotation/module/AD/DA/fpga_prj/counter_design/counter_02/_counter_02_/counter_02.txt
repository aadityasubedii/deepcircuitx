Module-level comment: The CounterWithEnableReset module implements a 4-bit counter with enable and reset facilities. It includes inputs `clk`, `rst_n`, `en`, and output `dout`. The counter increments on each clock cycle when `en` is high, unless reset by `rst_n` or when a count limit is reached. Output `dout` toggle based on the enable signal and reaches completion of the count cycle. The logic is encapsulated in two `always` blocks, handling counting and output management, using internal signals `add_cnt` and `end_cnt` to control the counter and output state.
