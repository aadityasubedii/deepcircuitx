Module name: CounterWithEnableReset

Module specification: The CounterWithEnableReset module is designed to implement a 4-bit counter with enable and active-low reset functionalities, alongside an output signal that can be toggled based on specified conditions. The module has three input ports, namely `clk` (clock), `rst_n` (active-low reset), and `en` (enable), and one output port, `dout`. The `clk` port synchronizes the operations within the module, `rst_n` resets the counter and `dout` to their initial states, and `en` controls the setting of `dout` to high under specific conditions. Internally, the module uses three signals: `cnt` to keep track of the count, `add_cnt` to indicate when to increment or reset the counter based on the value of `dout`, and `end_cnt` to signal the completion of the count cycle and necessitate a reset of the counter. The module comprises two major `always` blocks: one handles the incrementing and resetting of the counter based on the values of `add_cnt` and `end_cnt`, and the other manages the value of `dout` based on the `en` signal and `end_cnt` condition. This structure allows the module to effectively manage a counter that increments with each clock cycle when enabled, resets upon reaching a predefined limit, or upon receiving a reset signal, and controls an output signal based on these operations.
