The module features three input ports: 'clk' which serves as the clock input controlling the timing of the counter updates; 'rst_n' which is an active-low reset signal, resetting the counter to 0 when asserted; and 'vld_in' which is a validation input that enables the counter to increment only when it is high. There is one output port, 'cnt', which holds the current count value. Internally, 'cnt' is used as a register to store the count value and is the only internal signal in this module. The code consists of a single always block that describes the counter's sequential behavior. This block checks for the reset condition first\u2014if 'rst_n' is low, the counter is reset to 0. If not in reset and 'vld_in' is high with the count equal to 7, it resets the count indicating that it has reached the predefined limit. Otherwise, if 'vld_in' is high, it increments the count. This design ensures that the 'cnt' value does not exceed the maximum value of 7 before rolling over.",
