The counter increments every positive edge of the clock (`clk`) when the reset (`rst_n`) is not active (high) and when the input signal (`vld_in`) is high. The counter resets to 0 when `rst_n` is active (low) and also when the counter reaches 7 (assuming `cnt` has a maximum count of 7 and then rolls over to 0). This could be used for counting valid cycles up to a certain limit, in this case, up to 8 cycles (0 to 7), after which it resets."

It is updated on every positive edge of the clock signal `clk` when the reset signal `rst_n` is not asserted. If the input `vld_in` is high, `cnt` increments by 1 until it reaches the value of 7, upon which it resets back to 0. If `rst_n` is asserted (low), then `cnt` also resets to 0 regardless of the `vld_in` signal. Its role in the module is to keep track of the count of valid cycles based on the `vld_in` signal, and it also ensures that the count does not exceed a predefined maximum value (7 in this case) before rolling over."
