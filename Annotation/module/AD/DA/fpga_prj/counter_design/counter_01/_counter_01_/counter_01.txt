Module-level comment: The CounterModule increments a counter ('cnt') on every positive edge of the clock ('clk') when not reset ('rst_n' high) and if 'vld_in' is high. It resets 'cnt' to 0 on 'rst_n' being low or when 'cnt' reaches 7, ensuring it doesn't exceed this value. This behavior is implemented in a single always block handling sequential logic based on input conditions.
