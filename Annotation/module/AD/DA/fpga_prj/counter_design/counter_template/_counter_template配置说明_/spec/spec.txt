As there is no actual Verilog code or accompanying comments provided in your messages, I'm unable to generate a specification that includes the module name, explanation of its functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, or code blocks. To draft a module specification, I need the specific details of the Verilog RTL code.

If you can supply the code snippet and any additional information you'd like to include in the comments, I can compile a detailed specification for you. The desired format for the specification will be adhered to once the necessary information has been received.

Please provide the actual Verilog code, including its name, description, I/O port definitions, internal signals, and any specific comments that address the functioning of different blocks or sections within the code.
