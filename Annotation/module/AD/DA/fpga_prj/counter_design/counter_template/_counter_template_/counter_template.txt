Module-level comment: The CounterModule increments a counter based on clock (`clk`) and reset (`rst_n`) signals. It employs internal signals `add_cnt` and `end_cnt` for control. The counter increments when `add_cnt` is true and resets to zero on a reset signal or when `end_cnt` is true. The module operates on edge-sensitive conditions in an always block, handling different states of the counter based on control flags and reset conditions.
