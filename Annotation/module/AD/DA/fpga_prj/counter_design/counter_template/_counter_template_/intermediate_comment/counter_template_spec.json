    "spec": "Module name: CounterModule.\nModule specification: The CounterModule is designed to increment a counter based on specific conditions related to the clock and reset signals, and control flags. This module takes two primary inputs: `clk` (clock signal) which triggers the counting logic on its positive edge, and `rst_n` (reset signal), which is active low and used to reset the counter to zero asynchronously. There are no clear outputs specified in the code, but the register `cnt` could act as an output if the purpose of the module is to provide this count value externally. Inside the module, there are three internal signals utilized:\n1. `cnt`: a register that holds the current count value.\n2. `add_cnt` and `end_cnt`: wires that serve as control flags. `add_cnt` dictates whether the counter should increment, and `end_cnt` indicates if the counter reached its maximum value and should reset.\nThe code contains always blocks triggered by the `clk` and `rst_n` signals for setting or incrementing the `cnt` register based on the conditions defined by `add_cnt` and `end_cnt`. Additionally, there are incomplete assignment statements for `add_cnt` and `end_cnt`, which dictate their behavior but are left undefined in the provided code. Finally, the structure consists of conditions to handle reset scenarios, either from the reset signal or based on internal conditions controlled by `add_cnt` and `end_cnt`. This results in either maintaining, resetting, or incrementing the counter, forming the basic operational loop of this module.",
