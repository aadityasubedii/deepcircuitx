Module name: *Not explicitly provided in the given context.*

Module specification: This Verilog module is designed to parse and handle packets of data through a finite state machine (FSM) mechanism, transitioning between states (`IDLE`, `HEAD`, `TYPE`, `LEN`, `DATA`, `FCS`) to control the parsing of an incoming data stream. The module's functionality is driven by three input ports: `clk` (clock input for synchronization), `rst_n` (active-low reset to initialize the module), and `din` (data input representing the incoming packet data). The output ports include `dout` (data output for processed data), `dout_vld` (flag indicating valid data on `dout`), `dout_sop` (signal for the start of a packet), and `dout_eop` (signal for the end of a packet). Internal signals such as `state_c` and `state_n` (current and next FSM states), along with counters (`head_cnt`, `len_cnt`, `data_cnt`, `fcs_cnt`) and a flag (`head_flag`), efficiently manage the data parsing corresponding to each state of the FSM. The Verilog code is organized into several blocks, focusing on state transitions, counter management, handling input signals based on the current state, and updating output signals according to the data processing stage. This setup ensures that the module effectively interprets and processes structured packets, readying them for further system use while adhering to established packet protocols.
