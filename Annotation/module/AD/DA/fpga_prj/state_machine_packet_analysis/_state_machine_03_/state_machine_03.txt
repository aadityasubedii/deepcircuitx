Module-level comment: This module implements a FSM for packet data parsing, transitioning through states (IDLE, HEAD, TYPE, LEN, DATA, FCS) to manage and extract packet content. Utilizing inputs (clk, rst_n, din) and outputs (dout, dout_vld, dout_sop, dout_eop), alongside internal signals and counters, it synchronously processes incoming data, identifying packet boundaries and content, ensuring structured output for subsequent processing.
