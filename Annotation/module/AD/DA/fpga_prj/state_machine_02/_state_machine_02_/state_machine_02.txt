Module-level comment: The FSM_Edge_Detect module implements a finite state machine (FSM) with three states: IDLE, S1, and S2, utilizing an edge-detection mechanism on the `en` signal to facilitate transitions. It transitions states based on count values and flags indicating positive edges of `en`. The module processes transitions using combinational and sequential logic blocks managing state, count, and edge detection, ensuring detailed control conditions and synchronized operation with the system clock and an asynchronous reset.
