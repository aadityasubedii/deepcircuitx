Module name: FSM_Edge_Detect. Module specification: The FSM_Edge_Detect module is a Verilog-based design that implements a finite state machine (FSM) with three primary states: IDLE, S1, and S2. This FSM transitions through states based on specific input conditions, incorporating an edge detection mechanism for control. The input ports include `clk`, the system clock that dictates the timing of state transitions and signal updates; `rst_n`, an active-low asynchronous reset that initializes the FSM to the IDLE state; and `en`, an enable signal used for edge detection to generate a condition flag. The output signals are not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet; however, critical internal signals include `state_c` (current state of the FSM), `state_n` (next state of the FSM), and `count` (a counter used within states S1 and S2 for transition conditions). Additional internal signals are `idl2s1_start`, `s12s2_start`, and `s22s3_start`, which serve as conditions for state transitions based on the current state, `count`, and the `flag`. The `en_ff0` signal latches the previous state of `en` for edge detection, and `flag` is set when a positive edge on `en` is detected. The module's operation is explained across several always blocks: one managing state transitions upon clock or reset signals, another defining next state logic based on current conditions, one controlling the `count` signal within S1 and S2 states, and edge detection logic for generating the `flag` based on `en` signal edges. This concise structure ensures accurate and efficient FSM operation, with edge detection integrated to influence state transitions and conditions.
