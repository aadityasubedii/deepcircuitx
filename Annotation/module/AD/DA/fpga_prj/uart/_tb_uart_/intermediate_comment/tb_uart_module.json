    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'tb_uart' is a testbench for a UART module, mimicking data reception and observing outcomes via an 8-bit 'led'. It uses a clock generator, a reset mechanism, and a scripted 'rx_uart' signal to test UART behavior under various scenarios, ensuring the unit operates correctly across different conditions."
