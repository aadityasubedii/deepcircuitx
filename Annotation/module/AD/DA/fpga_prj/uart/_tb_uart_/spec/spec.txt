Module name: tb_uart. 
Module specification: The 'tb_uart' module is designed primarily as a testbench for validating a UART module's functionality. It provides a structured environment to simulate the UART's behavior during asynchronous data transmission. The testbench includes three input ports: 'clk' (clock), 'rst_n' (active-low reset), and 'rx_uart' (receive data line). Its single output port, 'led', is an 8-bit signal intended to display the module's status or received data. The internal signals 'clk', 'rst_n', and 'rx_uart' are used respectively for timing the simulation, initializing the module to a known state, and providing a mock data stream to emulate incoming communications. The 'led' signal exhibits the result of the UART's operation.

The code is organized into several segments: instantiation of the UART module under test (uut) with proper port mapping, an initial block to generate a clock signal with a defined period given by the 'CYCLE' parameter, another initial block for asserting and deasserting the reset signal, and a final initial block to toggle the 'rx_uart' line in pre-defined intervals mimicking a data stream. These blocks together establish a controlled test flow, where the UART's reaction to various data patterns can be observed and verified.
