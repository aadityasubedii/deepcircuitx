Module-level comment: The 'uart' module decodes asynchronous UART serial input 'rx_uart' into an 8-bit parallel output 'led'. It leverages counters ('cnt0', 'cnt1') to match baud rates and bit count, synchronized flip-flops ('rx_uart_ff0', 'rx_uart_ff1', 'rx_uart_ff2') for input stabilization, and conditional logic driven by 'clk' and 'rst_n' to manage state transitions, bit detection, and output assembly. This setup ensures accurate frame reception and conversion aligned with UART protocols.
