Module name: uart. Module specification: The 'uart' module is designed to interpret asynchronous serial communication encoded in UART protocol into parallel data. At its core, the module converts serial input 'rx_uart' to an 8-bit parallel output 'led'. Regarding input and output ports: 'clk' is the clock signal crucial for timing operations; 'rst_n' is an active-low reset that initializes all internal states; 'rx_uart' is the received serial data. The output 'led' signifies the received byte. Internal signals such as 'cnt0' and 'cnt1' serve as counters for measuring baud rates and data bits respectively. 'rx_uart_ff0', 'rx_uart_ff1', and 'rx_uart_ff2' are flip-flops for stabilizing the 'rx_uart' signal. 'flag_add' controls sample timing based on start bit detection. The module includes synchronous blocks for handling resets, counting operations, handling 'rx_uart' input signal stabilization, start bit detection, and data sampling, mostly controlled by edge-triggered logic conditioned upon the 'clk' and 'rst_n' signals. This framework effectively decodes incoming serial data while managing various states and outputs within defined UART communication constraints.
