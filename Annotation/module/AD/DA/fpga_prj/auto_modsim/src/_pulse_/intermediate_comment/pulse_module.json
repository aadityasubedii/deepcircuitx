    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pulse' module outputs a single-cycle high pulse on 'dout' when a count of 9 is reached by an internally managed counter 'cnt0'. Enabled by 'en' and synchronized to 'clk', it is reset by 'rst_n'. The counter increments when 'en' is active and resets after reaching the end count. Output 'dout' is driven high based on the counter state, all within synchronous and asynchronous reset control blocks for robust operation."
