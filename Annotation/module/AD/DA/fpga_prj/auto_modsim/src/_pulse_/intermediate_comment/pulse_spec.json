    "spec": "Module name: pulse.\n\nModule specification: The `pulse` module is purposefully designed to generate a high pulse on its output `dout` for a single clock cycle, synchronized to the input clock `clk` and enabled by the signal `en`. This operation commences when the module's internal counter, `cnt0`, completes a cycle from 0 to 9, upon which `dout` momentarily goes high before resetting. The module operates with three input ports: `clk`, an input clock that synchronizes the module's operations; `rst_n`, an active-low asynchronous reset that initializes the module's internal states; and `en`, an enable signal that activates the counting mechanism for pulse generation. The sole output port, `dout`, delivers the generated pulse signal. Internally, the module employs several critical signals: `flag_add`, a control signal for enabling the counter increment; `cnt0`, an 8-bit counter used in pulse generation; `add_cnt0`, mirroring `flag_add` to signify the counting action; and `end_cnt0`, indicating the completion of a counting cycle. The Verilog code is organized into defined blocks geared towards specific functionalities: one block handles the counter (`cnt0`) operation based on `add_cnt0` and `end_cnt0` conditions, another controls the `flag_add` signal in response to the `en` input and `end_cnt0` condition, and a third block manages the `dout` output, ensuring it reflects a high pulse when the counting criteria are met, all while being subject to the overarching `clk` and `rst_n` signals for synchronous operation and proper initialization upon reset. This structured approach ensures that `pulse` efficiently generates a pulse after every completed count cycle, effectively serving its intended signaling or triggering role in digital circuits.",

It operates synchronously with a clock signal `clk` and can be asynchronously reset by the active-low reset signal `rst_n`. Internally, the module uses a counter `cnt0`, which increments whenever the `flag_add` signal is high. When `cnt0` reaches the value of 9 (one less than 10), it resets to 0, and at the same time, `dout` outputs a high pulse for one clock cycle. The `flag_add` signal is set high when `en` is active and cleared when the end of the count (`end_cnt0`) is reached. This mechanism allows the module to generate a single-cycle pulse on `dout` whenever `en` goes high and the counter completes its cycle."
