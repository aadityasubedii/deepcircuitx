Module name: tb_pulse.

Module specification: The 'tb_pulse' module is a testbench designed to verify the functionality of a synchronous pulse generator module, presumably named 'pulse', which is instantiated within the testbench as 'pulse_inst'. It simulates a clock signal with a defined period ('CYCLE'), an active-low reset sequence ('rst_n'), and an enable signal ('en') to demonstrate the pulse generator's response under different operational conditions. The input ports include a clock signal 'clk' for timing, 'rst_n' for resetting the module, and 'en' for enabling/disabling the pulse generation functionality. The output port, 'dout', is used to observe the output pulse generated by the 'pulse' module. Internal signals are used to drive the clock, reset, and enable sequences. The code is structured into blocks: a clock generator that continuously toggles the 'clk' signal, a reset sequence that initializes the system, enablement logic that asserts and deasserts the 'en' signal, and commented regions for potential future developments like file I/O or additional control logic. Each of these blocks serves to create conditions for thorough testing of the 'pulse' module within a simulation environment.
