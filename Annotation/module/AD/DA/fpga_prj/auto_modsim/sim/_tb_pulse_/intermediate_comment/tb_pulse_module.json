    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'tb_pulse' Verilog module serves as a testbench for evaluating a pulse generator. It generates a clock signal, simulates a reset event, and toggles an enable signal to validate the module's response. Internal clock toggling, reset sequence, and enable logic are implemented to test the pulse functionality under varying conditions within the instantiated 'pulse' module."
