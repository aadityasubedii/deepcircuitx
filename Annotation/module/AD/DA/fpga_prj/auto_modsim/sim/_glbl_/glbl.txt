Module-level comment: The `glbl` module is designed for FPGA simulations, specifically handling global signals like Global Set/Reset (GSR) and Global 3-state (GTS) across designs. It initializes these signals to predefined states using internal registers (`GSR_int`, `GTS_int`) and managed delays (`ROC_WIDTH`, `TOC_WIDTH`) before releasing them. This setup helps simulate the initial behavior of flip-flops and tristate buffers, ensuring a controlled start for simulation environments without external input dependencies. Other outputs include JTAG and global configuration signals, largely serving as placeholders within the simulation framework.
