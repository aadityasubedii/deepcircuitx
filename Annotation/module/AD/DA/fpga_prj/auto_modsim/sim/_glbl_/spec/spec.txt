Module name: glbl.
Module specification: The `glbl` module is a specialized module designed for use in simulation environments, particularly with Xilinx FPGAs, focusing on simulating global behaviors like Global Set/Reset (GSR), Global 3-state (GTS), and other signals. This module does not possess any input ports, highlighting its unique application in controlling the global behavior of simulation elements rather than interacting with external signals. The output ports include `GSR` (Global Set/Reset), `GTS` (Global 3-state), `GWE` (Global Write Enable), `PRLD` (Preset/Reload), alongside other configuration and JTAG-related signals such as `PROGB_GLBL`, `CCLKO_GLBL`, `FCSBO_GLBL`, `DO_GLBL`, `DI_GLBL`, and various JTAG ports (`JTAG_TDO_GLBL`, `JTAG_TCK_GLBL`, etc.). These outputs simulate the initial reset state, 3-state buffering, and other global behaviors or serve as placeholders for JTAG interaction within the simulation environment.

The module defines multiple internal signals such as `GSR_int`, `GTS_int`, `PRLD_int` for simulating the internal mechanism of GSR and GTS signals, and other JTAG-related signals (`JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL`, `JTAG_RESET_GLBL`, etc.) to interface with the JTAG test architecture. The `p_up_tmp` and the tristate net `PLL_LOCKG` manage specific signal strengths for simulating pull-up/down behaviors.

The code comprises several blocks, including parameter definition for timing delays (`ROC_WIDTH` and `TOC_WIDTH`), wire and register declarations for simulation signaling, and initial blocks that determine the simulation start state of `GSR_int`, `GTS_int`, and `PRLD_int`. These initial blocks essentially set these signals to a known state before releasing them after a predefined delay, thus mimicking the global set/reset and 3-state control in an FPGA simulation environment. The use of strong and weak signal assignments further refines the simulation's signal behavior, capturing the nuances of FPGA signal properties during the initial phase of the simulation. This meticulous design allows the `glbl` module to effectively control and simulate the global set/reset and 3-state functionalities across the design under simulation, making it critical for accurate FPGA simulation workflows.
