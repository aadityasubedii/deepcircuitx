Module-level comment: The StateMachineModule cycles through three states (IDLE, S1, S2) based on conditions and a counter. It transitions from IDLE to S1 on an 'en' signal, from S1 to S2 when 'count' hits 4, and returns to IDLE from S2 at 'count' 6. The module utilizes sequential blocks for state and count management, with combinational logic for state transition decisions.
