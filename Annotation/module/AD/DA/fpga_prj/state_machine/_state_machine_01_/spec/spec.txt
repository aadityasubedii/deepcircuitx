Module name: StateMachineModule

Module specification: The StateMachineModule is designed to manage a state machine with three states: IDLE, S1, and S2. The primary functionality involves transitioning between these states based on the conditions met during operation. Inputs to the module include a clock signal 'clk' and an active-low reset 'rst_n', which ensure synchronized operations and system integrity, and an enable signal 'en' that initiates the transition out of the IDLE state. The module also makes internal use of a counter 'count' to determine specific transitions: from S1 to S2 when the count reaches 4, and from S2 back to IDLE when the count reaches 6.

Internal signals comprise 'state_c' and 'state_n' that respectively store the current state and compute the next state of the state machine. Additionally, signals 'idl2s1_start', 's12s2_start', and 's22s3_start' act as booleans to trigger state transitions under specific conditions derived from 'state_c', 'en', and 'count'. The code is structured into several blocks:
1. A sequential logic block triggered by the positive edge of 'clk' or the negative edge of 'rst_n' handles state updates.
2. A combinational logic block determines next state 'state_n' based on current state and conditions.
3. Assignment statements define conditions for state transitions.
4. Another sequential block manages the 'count' variable, updating its value based on current state and predefined conditions, and specifically resetting it upon reaching target values in states S1 and S2.

This module exemplifies the implementation of a finite state machine in Verilog with synchronization elements and conditional transitions dependent on both internal states and external inputs.
