    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'full_adder' module implements a basic combinational logic circuit for binary addition. It takes in two significant bits 'a' and 'b', along with a carry-in 'cin', and calculates the sum 'sout' and carry-out 'cout'. The sum is generated using an XOR of all inputs, while the carry-out results from an OR of all input pairs that can cause a carry. This module uses continuous assignments for immediate output updates without internal state."
