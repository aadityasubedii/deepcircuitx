    "spec": "Module name: full_adder. Module specification: The 'full_adder' module is a Verilog implementation of a digital combinational logic circuit specifically designed to perform full binary addition. This module takes three binary inputs: 'a' and 'b', which are the two significant bits being added, and 'cin', an incoming carry bit from a previous addition. It produces two binary outputs: 'sout', which is the sum of the inputs, calculated as \\(a \\oplus b \\oplus cin\\) (XOR operation of a, b, and cin); and 'cout', the outgoing carry bit, computed as \\((a \\& b) | (b \\& cin) | (a \\& cin)\\), representing an OR operation of all combinations of input pairs that can generate a carry. There are no internal signals used within this module, as the outputs are derived directly using continuous assignment without the need for latches or flip-flops to store intermediate results. The simplicity of the design reflects pure combinational logic, with changes in outputs correlating instantaneously with changes in input conditions, making it ideal for usage in larger arithmetic operations where carry propagation is considered.",

The sum (`sout`) is calculated using the XOR operation on the inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin`, representing the bitwise addition of the two significant bits and the carry-in.
