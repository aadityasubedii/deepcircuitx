Module name: tb_add_sub. 
Module specification: The tb_add_sub is a testbench module designed to verify the add_sub module, which performs addition or subtraction on two 4-bit operands based on a control signal. The input ports include: `a` and `b`, both 4-bit wide serving as operands; and `en`, a single-bit input that controls the operation mode (0 for addition and 1 for subtraction). The output ports are: `sdout`, a 4-bit wide port that holds the result (sum or difference), and `cbout`, a single-bit port indicating the carry or borrow outcome. Internally, the module utilizes the inputs `a`, `b`, and `en` as registers to store operands and control signals, and the outputs `sdout` and `cbout` are wires driven by the add_sub module. The code is organized into an initial block to simulate various input scenarios, dynamically switching the operation from addition to subtraction and vice versa, while displaying the outputs using the `$display` function at each step with a delay introduced using `#10` to observe the changes. The test sessions conclude with the `$finish` system call.
