    "module": "Module-level comment: The `tb_add_sub` module serves as a testbench for the `add_sub` module, testing addition and subtraction on 4-bit operands. It simulates various input combinations, toggling between addition (en=0) and subtraction (en=1), and displays the results. The outputs are managed with `sdout` for results and `cbout` for carry/borrow, utilizing scheduled delays (`#10`) for observing transitions and concludes with `$finish`."
