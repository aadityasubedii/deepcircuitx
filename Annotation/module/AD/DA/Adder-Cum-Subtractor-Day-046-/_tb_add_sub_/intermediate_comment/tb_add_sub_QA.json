The purpose of this testbench is to simulate the behavior of the `add_sub` module when it performs either addition or subtraction on two 4-bit binary inputs (`a` and `b`). The `en` signal determines the operation mode: when `en` is low (`0`), the `add_sub` module performs addition; when `en` is high (`1`), it performs subtraction.\n\nThe testbench sets various combinations of the input vectors `a` and `b` and toggles the `en` signal to test both addition and subtraction operations. The results of these operations are displayed as either sum with carry or difference with borrow using the `$display` system task, with different delays (`#10`) between operations to observe the changes over time. The `sdout` wire holds the result (sum or difference), and the `cbout` wire indicates the carry (for addition) or borrow (for subtraction).\n\nAfter the series of tests, the simulation is terminated with the `$finish` system call."
