Module-level comment: The 'add_sub' module is a 4-bit adder-subtractor implemented in Verilog that switches between addition and subtraction based on the 'en' signal. It uses four instances of 'full_adder', each processing one bit of operands 'A' and 'B'â€”with 'B' conditionally XORed with 'en'. Carries between full adders are handled by internal signals 'c[2:0]', controlling the flow of carry/borrow across stages, outputting the result in 'sdout' and the final carry/borrow in 'cbout'.
