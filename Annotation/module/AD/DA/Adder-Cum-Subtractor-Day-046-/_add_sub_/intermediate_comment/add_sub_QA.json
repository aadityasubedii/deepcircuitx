The functionality of the module switches between addition and subtraction based on the 'en' signal. When 'en' is 0, the module performs addition; when 'en' is 1, it performs subtraction (using XOR gates to invert 'B' and passing carry/borrow inputs appropriately). The result is output in 'sdout', and 'cbout' is the final carry (addition) or borrow (subtraction) output."

Explanation: 'A' and 'B' are 4-bit wide inputs representing the numbers to be added or subtracted. The 'en' (enable) signal determines the operation mode: '0' for addition and '1' for subtraction.\n\nOutput ports: sdout, cbout. Explanation: 'sdout' is a 4-bit wide output port that represents the sum (during addition) or difference (during subtraction) of inputs 'A' and 'B'. 'cbout' is a single-bit output that functions as the carry out in addition mode and borrow out in subtraction mode."

Explanation: The `c[2:0]` signal is an array of three 1-bit wires used as carry (or borrow) signals between the stages of the full adders. Specifically, `c[0]` is the carry out from the first full adder that is used as the carry in for the second full adder, `c[1]` is the carry out from the second full adder used as the carry in for the third full adder, and `c[2]` is the carry out from the third full adder used as the carry in for the fourth full adder. This propagation of carry or borrow bits is crucial for the correct computation of the sum or difference in multi-bit addition or subtraction."
