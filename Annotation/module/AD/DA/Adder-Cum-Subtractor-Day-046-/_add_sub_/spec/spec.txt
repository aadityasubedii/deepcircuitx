Module name: add_sub. Module specification: The 'add_sub' Verilog module defines a 4-bit adder-subtractor that performs either addition or subtraction on two 4-bit inputs based on an enable signal. It consists of inputs 'A' and 'B', both 4-bit vectors representing operands, and 'en', a single-bit control signal that determines the operation mode (0 for addition, 1 for subtraction). The outputs are 'sdout', a 4-bit vector representing the sum or difference, and 'cbout', a single-bit output serving as carry out for addition or borrow out for subtraction. Internally, the module employs three 1-bit wires, 'c[2:0]', serving as carry or borrow signals interconnecting the stages of the full adders. The code contains four instances of a 'full_adder' submodule, each taking corresponding bits from 'A' and 'B' (where 'B' is conditionally inverted based on 'en'), the previous stage's carry or borrow as input, and producing one bit of the result and the next stage's carry or borrow. This modular construction illustrates a sequence of operations spanning bit-wise addition/subtraction processes culminating in the 4-bit result and final carry/borrow output.
