The 'a' and 'b' are the inputs representing the two binary digits to be added. The 's' output represents the sum of the two digits, and 'c' output represents the carry out. The sum 's' is calculated by performing the bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation on inputs 'a' and 'b'. The carry out 'c' is calculated by performing the bitwise AND operation on inputs 'a' and 'b'. This module does not consider any carry input from previous stages of addition, unlike a full adder."
