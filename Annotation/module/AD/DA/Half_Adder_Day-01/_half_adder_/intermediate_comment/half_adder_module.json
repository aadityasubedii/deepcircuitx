    "module": "Module-level comment: The half_adder module implements the arithmetic computation of adding two single-bit binary numbers, providing a sum and carry output. It leverages bitwise XOR and AND operations for direct computation of the sum ('s') and carry ('c') from the input bits ('a' and 'b'), without interim storage or internal signals, resulting in a compact and efficient design."
