Module name: half_adder. Module specification: The half_adder module is designed to compute the addition of two binary digits. It efficiently calculates this addition without considering any carry input from previous stages, distinguishing it from a full adder. The module takes two input ports, 'a' and 'b', which represent the binary digits to be added. The output of the module includes two ports: 's' for the sum, and 'c' for the carry out. The sum 's' is computed using a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation on 'a' and 'b', while the carry out 'c' is derived from a bitwise AND operation on the same inputs. The code within the module directly assigns these operations to the outputs without the use of any internal signals, thereby simplifying the design and making it more direct and efficient. This structure exemplifies a straightforward implementation of a half adder in Verilog, focusing purely on the essential computational aspects without additional complexity.
