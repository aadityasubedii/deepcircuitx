The module possesses two input ports, 'a' and 'b', which accept the binary bits to be added. It also features two output ports, 's' and 'c', where 's' corresponds to the computed sum, and 'c' represents the carry generated when both inputs are '1'. Internally, the module operates without explicit internal signals, as the instantiated XOR and AND gates are connected directly to the respective outputs. The XOR gate is responsible for the sum calculation, outputting the result to port 's'. Similarly, the AND gate determines the carry output, signaling it through port 'c'. The module is straightforward, consisting only of the definition of the I/O ports and the two gate instantiations that perform the required binary addition without unnecessary internal complexity.",
