A half adder is a basic digital circuit that performs the addition of two single-bit binary numbers. The module takes two single-bit inputs `a` and `b`, and produces two outputs `s` (sum) and `c` (carry). The `xor` gate is used to generate the sum of `a` and `b`, while the `and` gate produces the carry out, indicating whether both inputs are `1`. There are no inline comments in the provided code that offer additional explanation."

The output port 'c' is the carry output, representing whether a carry is generated from the addition of the two bits, computed using an AND gate.
