Module name: half_adder_behvaioural. Module specification: The half_adder_behvaioural is a Verilog module designed to implement a simple half-adder circuit using behavioral modeling. A half-adder is a combinational logic circuit tasked with computing the sum and carry of two single-bit binary numbers. The module has two input ports, `a` and `b`, which represent the binary numbers to be added. It also includes two output ports, `s` for the sum and `c` for the carry of the addition operation. The sum output `s` is derived by performing a bitwise XOR operation on the inputs `a` and `b`, effectively computing the binary sum without considering the carry. The carry output `c` is obtained by performing a bitwise AND operation on the same inputs, indicating an overflow to the next higher bit when both inputs are high (`1`). There are no internal signals used within this module, as the operation is straightforward and utilizes directly the input ports for computing the outputs. The module's primary functional block is an `always` block triggered by any change in the input signals (`*` sensitivity list), ensuring that the outputs `s` and `c` are updated accordingly. The simplicity of this module, without the use of internal signals, underscores its direct approach to implementing the basic half-adder logic using behavioral modeling in Verilog.
