A half-adder is a combinational logic circuit that computes the sum and carry of two single-bit binary numbers. The input signals to the module are 'a' and 'b', which represent the two binary bits to be added. There are two outputs from the module, 's' for sum and 'c' for carry. The sum 's' is computed as the bitwise XOR (^) of the input bits 'a' and 'b', which gives the correct sum digit in binary addition without carry. The carry 'c' is computed as the bitwise AND (&) of 'a' and 'b', which gives a carry output when both input bits are 1. The output is registered, and the always block is triggered on any change of the inputs, updating the sum and carry accordingly."

Explanation: The input ports `a` and `b` represent the two single-bit binary numbers that are to be added by the half-adder. These inputs act as the primary data for the addition operation, triggering the computation of the sum and carry whenever their values change.\n\nOutput ports: `s`, `c`. Explanation: The output port `s` stands for the sum of the binary addition and is computed as the bitwise XOR of input ports `a` and `b`. This results in a binary sum where there is no carry. The output port `c` represents the carry out of the addition and is computed as the bitwise AND of `a` and `b`. This means that the carry will be high (1) only if both `a` and `b` are high (1), indicating an overflow in binary addition that needs to be carried to the next higher bit."
