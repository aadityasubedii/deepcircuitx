    "spec": "Module name: half_adder_behvaioural. Module specification: The half_adder_behvaioural is a Verilog module designed to implement a simple half-adder circuit using behavioral modeling. A half-adder is a combinational logic circuit tasked with computing the sum and carry of two single-bit binary numbers. The module has two input ports, `a` and `b`, which represent the binary numbers to be added. It also includes two output ports, `s` for the sum and `c` for the carry of the addition operation. The sum output `s` is derived by performing a bitwise XOR operation on the inputs `a` and `b`, effectively computing the binary sum without considering the carry. The carry output `c` is obtained by performing a bitwise AND operation on the same inputs, indicating an overflow to the next higher bit when both inputs are high (`1`). There are no internal signals used within this module, as the operation is straightforward and utilizes directly the input ports for computing the outputs. The module's primary functional block is an `always` block triggered by any change in the input signals (`*` sensitivity list), ensuring that the outputs `s` and `c` are updated accordingly. The simplicity of this module, without the use of internal signals, underscores its direct approach to implementing the basic half-adder logic using behavioral modeling in Verilog.",

A half-adder is a combinational logic circuit that computes the sum and carry of two single-bit binary numbers. The input signals to the module are 'a' and 'b', which represent the two binary bits to be added. There are two outputs from the module, 's' for sum and 'c' for carry. The sum 's' is computed as the bitwise XOR (^) of the input bits 'a' and 'b', which gives the correct sum digit in binary addition without carry. The carry 'c' is computed as the bitwise AND (&) of 'a' and 'b', which gives a carry output when both input bits are 1. The output is registered, and the always block is triggered on any change of the inputs, updating the sum and carry accordingly."

Explanation: The output port `s` stands for the sum of the binary addition and is computed as the bitwise XOR of input ports `a` and `b`. This results in a binary sum where there is no carry. The output port `c` represents the carry out of the addition and is computed as the bitwise AND of `a` and `b`. This means that the carry will be high (1) only if both `a` and `b` are high (1), indicating an overflow in binary addition that needs to be carried to the next higher bit."
