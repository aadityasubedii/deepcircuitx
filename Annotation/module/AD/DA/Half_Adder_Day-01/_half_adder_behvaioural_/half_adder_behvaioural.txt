Module-level comment: Implements a simple half-adder circuit in Verilog using behavioral modeling. It calculates the sum (`s`) and carry (`c`) of two binary inputs (`a` and `b`) without internal signals. The sum is obtained via bitwise XOR, and the carry through bitwise AND, ensuring real-time update with changes in inputs.
