Module-level comment: The 'dds' module generates waveforms using Digital Direct Synthesis, controlled by a 32-bit frequency and a 12-bit phase word. It latches input control words, accumulates phase based on frequency, and uses this to address a ROM for waveform output. It operates on a clock with active low reset.
