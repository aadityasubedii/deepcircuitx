Module name: dds. 

Module specification: The 'dds' module is a Digital Direct Synthesis component designed to generate waveforms based on input frequency (Fword) and phase (Pword) control words. It operates on a positive edge-triggered clock ('clk') with an active low reset ('rst_n'). The module accepts a 32-bit frequency control word (Fword) and a 12-bit phase control word (Pword) as inputs, producing a 14-bit waveform data output ('data'). Internally, the module uses several significant signals: 'Fword_f' and 'Pword_f' are registers that latch the input control words on every clock cycle to ensure stable operation. The 'phase_add' signal acts as a phase accumulator, incrementing by the value of 'Fword_f' at each clock cycle unless a reset is applied, with its significant bits contributing to the ROM address ('rom_addr') generation combined with 'Pword_f' for phase adjustments. The 'rom_addr' serves as the address for the ROM ('rom_u'), which translates the address into waveform samples outputted as 'data'. The Verilog implementation is organized into distinct code blocks handling signal latching, phase accumulation, and ROM address calculation, ensuring coherent module functionality. This structured approach facilitates generating precise waveforms with adjustable frequency and phase, making it a versatile component in digital synthesis applications.
