It operates on a rising clock edge ('clk') and has an active low reset ('rst_n'). The frequency word (Fword) and phase word (Pword) are latched on every clock cycle into registers Fword_f and Pword_f, respectively. An accumulator (phase_add) adds the latched frequency word to itself every clock cycle unless reset is not active. The most significant bits of the phase accumulator are used as an address (rom_addr) for a ROM (rom_u), which outputs sine wave samples or other waveforms based upon the ROM contents; the phase word is added to this address, allowing for phase adjustments. The ROM then outputs a 14-bit data value ('data'), which represents the waveform value at the given phase and frequency."

It synchronizes the internal operations of the DDS, such as updating the frequency and phase words and incrementing the phase accumulator.\n- rst_n: This is the active-low reset input. When set to '0', it initializes the phase accumulator to zero and prepares the module for a fresh start.\n- Fword: This represents the frequency control word, a 32-bit input that determines the frequency of the generated waveform.\n- Pword: This is the phase control word, a 12-bit input that allows for phase adjustments to the generated waveform.\n\nOutput ports: data.\nExplanation:\n- data: This is a 14-bit output that provides the digitally synthesized waveform data. It represents the current value of the waveform based on the calculations using the frequency and phase words. The waveform data is typically derived from a ROM table that maps phase accumulator values to the actual waveform samples."

It ensures that the frequency control word remains stable throughout the operational cycle of the module, allowing for consistent frequency calculation in the phase accumulator.\n- **Pword_f**: This is a register that captures and holds the phase control word (Pword). Like Fword_f, this latched value is used consistently in the calculation cycle to adjust the phase of the output waveform.\n- **phase_add**: This 32-bit register acts as a phase accumulator in the module. At each clock cycle, it adds the latched frequency word (Fword_f) to its previous value unless the module is reset. The phase accumulator is critical as it determines the rate at which the waveform progresses based on the input frequency.\n- **rom_addr**: This is a wire derived from the most significant bits of the phase accumulator (phase_add) combined with the latched phase word (Pword_f). It serves as an address for the ROM, which contains the waveform data. Modification of this address by phase and frequency adjustments enables the DDS to output the desired phase and frequency of the waveform."
