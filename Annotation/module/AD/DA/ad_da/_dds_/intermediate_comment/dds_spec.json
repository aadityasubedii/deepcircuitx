    "spec": "Module name: dds. \n\nModule specification: The 'dds' module is a Digital Direct Synthesis component designed to generate waveforms based on input frequency (Fword) and phase (Pword) control words. It operates on a positive edge-triggered clock ('clk') with an active low reset ('rst_n'). The module accepts a 32-bit frequency control word (Fword) and a 12-bit phase control word (Pword) as inputs, producing a 14-bit waveform data output ('data'). Internally, the module uses several significant signals: 'Fword_f' and 'Pword_f' are registers that latch the input control words on every clock cycle to ensure stable operation. The 'phase_add' signal acts as a phase accumulator, incrementing by the value of 'Fword_f' at each clock cycle unless a reset is applied, with its significant bits contributing to the ROM address ('rom_addr') generation combined with 'Pword_f' for phase adjustments. The 'rom_addr' serves as the address for the ROM ('rom_u'), which translates the address into waveform samples outputted as 'data'. The Verilog implementation is organized into distinct code blocks handling signal latching, phase accumulation, and ROM address calculation, ensuring coherent module functionality. This structured approach facilitates generating precise waveforms with adjustable frequency and phase, making it a versatile component in digital synthesis applications.",

It operates on a rising clock edge ('clk') and has an active low reset ('rst_n'). The frequency word (Fword) and phase word (Pword) are latched on every clock cycle into registers Fword_f and Pword_f, respectively. An accumulator (phase_add) adds the latched frequency word to itself every clock cycle unless reset is not active. The most significant bits of the phase accumulator are used as an address (rom_addr) for a ROM (rom_u), which outputs sine wave samples or other waveforms based upon the ROM contents; the phase word is added to this address, allowing for phase adjustments. The ROM then outputs a 14-bit data value ('data'), which represents the waveform value at the given phase and frequency."

It ensures that the frequency control word remains stable throughout the operational cycle of the module, allowing for consistent frequency calculation in the phase accumulator.\n- **Pword_f**: This is a register that captures and holds the phase control word (Pword). Like Fword_f, this latched value is used consistently in the calculation cycle to adjust the phase of the output waveform.\n- **phase_add**: This 32-bit register acts as a phase accumulator in the module. At each clock cycle, it adds the latched frequency word (Fword_f) to its previous value unless the module is reset. The phase accumulator is critical as it determines the rate at which the waveform progresses based on the input frequency.\n- **rom_addr**: This is a wire derived from the most significant bits of the phase accumulator (phase_add) combined with the latched phase word (Pword_f).
