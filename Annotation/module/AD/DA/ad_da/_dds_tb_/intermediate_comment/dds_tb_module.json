    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"example_tb\" module serves as a testbench for evaluating two DDS modules, `dds_A` and `dds_B`, by testing their response to various frequency and phase inputs. It generates a clock signal and manages reset operations while applying different test conditions through initial blocks. This setup enables systematic testing of DDS functionalities, ensuring their correct behavior under diverse conditions."
