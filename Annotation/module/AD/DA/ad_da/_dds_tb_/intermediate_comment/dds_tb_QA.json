It ensures the synchronous operation of internal circuits.\n- `rst_n`: This is the active-low reset input. It initializes or resets the internal state of the DDS modules to a known state at the beginning of the operation or after an event that requires re-initialization.\n- `FwordA`: This is the frequency control word for the first DDS module (dds_A). It determines the output frequency of the corresponding DDS module.\n- `PwordA`: This is the phase control word for the first DDS module (dds_A). It sets the phase offset for the generated waveform.\n- `FwordB`: Similar to FwordA, this is the frequency control word for the second DDS module (dds_B).\n- `PwordB`: Similar to PwordA, this is the phase control word for the second DDS module (dds_B).\n\nOutput ports: dataA, dataB.\nExplanation: \n- `dataA`: This is the output data from the first DDS module (dds_A) which represents the synthesized digital waveform based on the input frequency and phase words.\n- `dataB`: Similarly, this is the output from the second DDS module (dds_B), representing another synthesized waveform corresponding to its input controls."

It toggles at a frequency determined by the parameter `CYCLE`. Specifically, it toggles every half-cycle duration to maintain the desired frequency, crucial for the synchronous behavior of the DDS modules.\n- `rst_n`: This signal is used internally to reset the DDS modules. It's initially set high, then pulled low briefly to initiate a reset, and then set high again to allow normal operation. The timing of these transitions is critical for ensuring the modules start in a known state.\n- `FwordA`: This is an internally held frequency word for the DDS module `dds_A`. It defines the frequency of the output waveform that the `dds_A` module generates. It's changed at various points in time during simulation to test how the module responds to different frequencies.\n- `PwordA`: This is an internally held phase word for the DDS module `dds_A`. It determines the initial phase of the output waveform from `dds_A` and is used in the simulation to observe the response of the module to phase shifts.\n- `dataA`: This is an output wire connected to `dds_A`. It carries the waveform signal generated by `dds_A` based on the set frequency and phase words (`FwordA` and `PwordA`).\n- `FwordB`: This serves a similar purpose as `FwordA` but applies to the `dds_B` module. It holds the frequency word for `dds_B`, dictating the frequency of the output waveform produced by this module.\n- `PwordB`: Corresponding to `PwordA` but for the `dds_B` module. It holds the phase word, affecting the initial phase of the waveform output from `dds_B`.\n- `dataB`: Like `dataA`, but as an output from `dds_B`.
