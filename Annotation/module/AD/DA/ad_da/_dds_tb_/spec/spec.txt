Module name: example_tb. 

Module specification: The "example_tb" is a Verilog testbench module designed to simulate and test two instances of a Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) module referred to as `dds_A` and `dds_B`. It primarily functions to evaluate the behavior of these DDS modules under various frequency and phase configurations. The testbench module utilizes input ports such as `clk` for the clock signal, ensuring synchronous operations, and `rst_n` for the active-low reset functionality, initializing the DDS modules. The frequency and phase control words for the DDS modules are represented by `FwordA`, `PwordA` for `dds_A`, and `FwordB`, `PwordB` for `dds_B`, determining the output frequency and phase shift of the generated waveforms. The output data from the DDS modules is captured through `dataA` and `dataB`, showcasing the synthesized waveforms. Internally, the module generates a periodic clock signal using a predefined `CYCLE` parameter and manages the reset logic to correctly initialize the DDS modules. Furthermore, it dynamically alters the frequency and phase control words (`FwordA`, `PwordA`, `FwordB`, `PwordB`) to test the DDS modules' response to different input conditions. The Verilog code is structured into several initial blocks: one for generating the clock signal, another for applying reset logic, and a third block dedicated to applying test stimuli (frequency and phase words) to the DDS modules and observing their output behavior over time. This structured approach allows for a comprehensive simulation environment, facilitating the evaluation of the DDS modules' performance and functionality under various operational conditions.
