It is active low, meaning the system is in reset state when this signal is low.\n- **din**: Represents the digital input that is to be converted to an analog signal by the DAC. This test bench sets it to a specific value for testing.\n- **din_vld**: Indicates when the data (`din`) is ready to be processed by the DAC. The operation of the DAC depends on the presence of valid input data.\n\n### Output Ports:\n- **cs**: Chip Select.\n- **sclk**: Serial Clock.\n- **sdi**: Serial Data Input.\n- **ldac**: Load DAC signal.\n- **rst**: Reset signal derived from `rst_n`, used internally for synchronization.\n\n### Explanation:\n- **cs**: A control signal used to select the DAC chip for communication. It is essential in systems where multiple devices share communication lines.\n- **sclk**: Provides the timing for serial data transmission to the DAC. It works in conjunction with `sdi` to serialize the input data.\n- **sdi**: Carries the serial version of the `din` input data to the DAC for conversion. Its operation is synchronized with `sclk`.\n- **ldac**: A signal used to trigger the actual update of the DAC's output voltage to the new value specified by the digital input data.

It is used by the `dac_c` module to coordinate reset actions synchronously with the internal clock. The inversion from active-low to active is done by the `rst` submodule instantiated inside the `dac_c_tb` test bench to match the `dac_c` module's reset polarity expectations. \n- `rdy`: This signal is an output from the `dac_c` module.
