Module-level comment: The `dac_c_tb` test bench module validates a DAC controller by injecting a simulated 16-bit input (`din`), clock (`clk`), and active-low reset (`rst_n`). It monitors control signals (`cs`, `sclk`, `sdi`, `ldac`) and handles ready (`rdy`) synchronization. The module uses initial and always blocks to emulate signal timing and DAC interactions.
