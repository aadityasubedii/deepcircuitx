Module name: dac_c_tb.
Module specification: The `dac_c_tb` module acts as a test bench for the verification of a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) controller module, ensuring its correct functionality before deployment. The test bench facilitates generation of a clock signal (`clk`), an active low reset signal (`rst_n`), and stimulates the DAC with input data (`din`) marked as valid by `din_vld`. It observes the DAC controller's output control signals including `cs` (chip select), `sclk` (serial clock), `sdi` (serial data input), and `ldac` (load DAC signal). Internal to the test bench are signals such as `rst`, which is a synchronized reset signal used by the instantiated DAC controller (`dac_c`), and `rdreq`, a read request signal derived from the `rdy` signal outputted by `dac_c` indicating its readiness to accept data.

The test bench is organized into several code blocks: instantiation of a reset generator module `rst` that converts the active low `rst_n` to a synchronized active high `rst`, instantiation of the DAC controller module `dac_c_u` with its associated inputs and outputs, and an always block that manages the `din_vld` signal state depending on the `rdreq` and reset condition. Thereâ€™s also an initial block that generates the clock signal by toggling `clk` with a defined period (`CYCLE`), and separate initial blocks to drive the reset sequence and set a predefined value for `din`. Collectively, these sections form a simulation environment that replicates a real-world scenario for rigorously testing the DAC's control logic.
