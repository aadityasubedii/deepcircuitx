It takes in a clock signal `clk` and an active-low asynchronous reset signal `rst_n`. The module outputs a synchronized reset signal `rst`. Inside the module, there's a flip-flop `rst1` that captures the state of the `rst_n` signal on the rising edge of `clk`. Then, the output `rst` takes the value of `rst1` on the next clock cycle. This two-stage flip-flop approach is often used to mitigate glitches and to synchronize an asynchronous reset signal to the clock domain of the design, reducing the risk of metastability."
