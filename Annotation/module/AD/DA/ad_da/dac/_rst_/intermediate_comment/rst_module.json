    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'rst' module synchronizes an active-low async reset to the clock domain, using a 2-stage flip-flop. On reset, both stages are cleared. Otherwise, the input (rst_n) is captured by 'rst1' and then propagated to the output (rst) on subsequent clock edges, ensuring a stable reset signal."
