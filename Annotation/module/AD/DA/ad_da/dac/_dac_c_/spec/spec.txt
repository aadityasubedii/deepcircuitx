Module name: dac_c.

Module specification:
The 'dac_c' module is a Verilog-based hardware component designed to control a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) using serial communication. Its core functionality includes serializing 16-bit digital input data (`din`) along with a valid signal indicator (`din_vld`) and generating appropriate control and timing signals to interface with an external DAC device. Input ports comprise a clock (`clk`), asynchronous active-low reset (`rst_n`), the data input (`din`), and its validity flag (`din_vld`). The outputs include a ready signal (`rdy`), chip select (`cs`), serial clock (`sclk`), serial data input (`sdi`), and load signal (`ldac`). Internally, the module uses multiple signals and counters such as `flag_add`, `cnt_div`, `add_cnt_div`, `end_cnt_div`, `clk_neg`, `clk_pos`, `cnt0`, `add_cnt0`, `end_cnt0`, `cnt1`, `add_cnt1`, `end_cnt1`, `x`, `din_tmp`, and `sdi_en` to control the data serialization process, timing, and synchronization steps. This module is split into several code blocks, each focusing on specific tasks: resetting and managing state changes (`flag_add`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, `cs`, `sdi`, `ldac`), clock division (`cnt_div`), data serialization (`din_tmp`, `sdi`), and control signal generation (`cs`, `ldac`). Each block involves edge-triggered registers and combinational logic that work together to serialize the input data accurately and generate control signals for the DAC according to the serial protocol.
