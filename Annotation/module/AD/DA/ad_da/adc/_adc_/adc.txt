Module-level comment: The "adc" module emulates an Analog-to-Digital Converter using a finite state machine to manage acquisition and conversion phases, interfacing via SPI protocol. It uses internal counters to time operations and SPI signals (`cs`, `mosi`, `sclk`) to communicate with external devices, capturing incoming data on an external serial clock (`miso` into `dout`). The implementation leverages sequential always blocks for state transitions and data handling, with combinational logic used for control signal assignments and timing conditions.
