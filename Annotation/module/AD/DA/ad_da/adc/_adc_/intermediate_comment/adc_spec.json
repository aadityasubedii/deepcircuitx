    "spec": "Module name: adc.\n\nModule specification: The \"adc\" module in Verilog serves to emulate the behavior of an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) using digital logic. Its main functionality encompasses state-controlled ADC operations like acquisition and conversion phases, synchronized through a clock signal, and interfacing with an external device using Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol signals. The input ports consist of the clock signal (`clk`) for synchronizing the module's operations, an active-low reset (`rst_n`) to initialize the module, a control flag (`rvs`) to manage state transitions, and a Master-In Slave-Out signal (`miso`) for receiving serial input data. The outputs are a 16-bit data register (`dout`) holding the ADC result, a chip select signal (`cs`) to manage SPI communication, a Master-Out Slave-In (`mosi`) signal for sending serial data, and a serial clock output (`sclk`) to synchronize serial data exchange.\n\nInternally, the module leverages signals such as `state_c` and `state_n` to control the ADC's operational states, signals like `cnt`, `cnt1` and associated controls (`add_cnt`, `end_cnt`, `add_cnt1`, `end_cnt1`) for timing different phases, and `flag_add` to manage data transfers. The Verilog code features blocks that handle state transitions within a finite state machine, conditional assignments to manage clock synchronization and signal conditioning, counters for acquisition and conversion timing, and data shifting based on serial clock events. The code uses parameters for configurations, such as the number of operations (`nops`) and acquisition time (`t_acq`), and exhibits a regular structure of always blocks for sequential logic and assign statements for combinational logic. Each element of the module is cohesively designed to ensure accurate modeling of an ADC operation in a digital system.",

When asserted (i.e., pulled low), it initializes all internal states, registers, and outputs to their default states, effectively resetting the module.\n  - `rvs`: Input signal used as a control flag during state transitions specifically from conversion (`cov`) to acquisition (`acq`).\n  - `miso`: Master-In Slave-Out signal. It is used to input serial data from an external device (slave) to the ADC module (acting as a master in this context). This serial data is captured and stored within the module.\n\nOutput Ports:\n- dout, cs, mosi, sclk\n\n  Explanation:\n  - `dout`: Output data register where the converted data is stored. It is a 16-bit wide register meant to hold the ADC result.\n  - `cs`: Chip Select output signal. It is used to initiate or terminate communication with an external device (slave). Typically, when this signal is low, it indicates that the slave device is selected and ready to communicate.\n  - `mosi`: Master-Out Slave-In signal. It is used to output serial data from the ADC module to an external device. The data contents are determined by the internal state and operations of the module.\n  - `sclk`: Serial Clock Output. It is driven by the ADC module and is used to synchronize the serial data transmission (for both MOSI and MISO signals).

                    "text": "Module name: adc.\n\nModule specification: The \"adc\" module in Verilog serves to emulate the behavior of an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) using digital logic. Its main functionality encompasses state-controlled ADC operations like acquisition and conversion phases, synchronized through a clock signal, and interfacing with an external device using Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol signals. The input ports consist of the clock signal (`clk`) for synchronizing the module's operations, an active-low reset (`rst_n`) to initialize the module, a control flag (`rvs`) to manage state transitions, and a Master-In Slave-Out signal (`miso`) for receiving serial input data. The outputs are a 16-bit data register (`dout`) holding the ADC result, a chip select signal (`cs`) to manage SPI communication, a Master-Out Slave-In (`mosi`) signal for sending serial data, and a serial clock output (`sclk`) to synchronize serial data exchange.\n\nInternally, the module leverages signals such as `state_c` and `state_n` to control the ADC's operational states, signals like `cnt`, `cnt1` and associated controls (`add_cnt`, `end_cnt`, `add_cnt1`, `end_cnt1`) for timing different phases, and `flag_add` to manage data transfers. The Verilog code features blocks that handle state transitions within a finite state machine, conditional assignments to manage clock synchronization and signal conditioning, counters for acquisition and conversion timing, and data shifting based on serial clock events. The code uses parameters for configurations, such as the number of operations (`nops`) and acquisition time (`t_acq`), and exhibits a regular structure of always blocks for sequential logic and assign statements for combinational logic. Each element of the module is cohesively designed to ensure accurate modeling of an ADC operation in a digital system."
