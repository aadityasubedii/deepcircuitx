The functionality includes clock synchronization, state management for conversion phases, and data transfer via Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication protocol elements like master-out slave-in (MOSI), master-in slave-out (MISO), and chip select (CS) signals. The `adc` module utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) with states for reset (rst), acquisition (acq), and conversion (cov) to manage the ADC process. It counts clock cycles for timing acquisition and conversion phases, controls the serial clock (sclk) based on the chip select signal, and dynamically generates the MOSI signal based on a predefined parameter (`reah`). The module captures incoming serial data bit by bit on positive edges of an externally supplied serial clock (not the same as the main clk) and stores it in the `dout` output register after each successful conversion cycle."

When asserted (i.e., pulled low), it initializes all internal states, registers, and outputs to their default states, effectively resetting the module.\n  - `rvs`: Input signal used as a control flag during state transitions specifically from conversion (`cov`) to acquisition (`acq`).\n  - `miso`: Master-In Slave-Out signal. It is used to input serial data from an external device (slave) to the ADC module (acting as a master in this context). This serial data is captured and stored within the module.\n\nOutput Ports:\n- dout, cs, mosi, sclk\n\n  Explanation:\n  - `dout`: Output data register where the converted data is stored. It is a 16-bit wide register meant to hold the ADC result.\n  - `cs`: Chip Select output signal. It is used to initiate or terminate communication with an external device (slave). Typically, when this signal is low, it indicates that the slave device is selected and ready to communicate.\n  - `mosi`: Master-Out Slave-In signal. It is used to output serial data from the ADC module to an external device. The data contents are determined by the internal state and operations of the module.\n  - `sclk`: Serial Clock Output.
