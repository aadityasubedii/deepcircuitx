Module name: clk_en_tb. 
Module specification: The "clk_en_tb" is a testbench module designed to validate the function of the 'clk_en' module by simulating its response to various input conditions. This testbench manages three input signals to the 'clk_en' module - a clock signal (`clk`), an active-low reset signal (`rst_n`), and a control signal (`cs`). The ‘clk’ serves as the timing reference, transitioning every 10 ns (half of the defined 20 ns cycle time) to drive the internal timing of the 'clk_en' module. The `rst_n` signal is used to test the reset functionality by initially being set high and then toggled low after 2 ns and kept low for three clock cycles before setting it high again. The `cs` signal allows evaluation of the 'clk_en' module’s response to control logic changes, set high initially, then toggled between high and low states in different intervals (100 cycles each, and 1000 cycles) to simulate control scenarios. The only output from this setup is `sclk`, which would represent the serial clock output from the 'clk_en' module, influenced by the input signals’ states. Internally, the testbench uses the signals `clk`, `rst_n`, and `cs` directly connected to the 'clk_en' input ports, with no additional internal processing. The code structure includes individual initial blocks that separately handle the manipulations of `clk`, `rst_n`, and `cs` to simulate the desired test scenarios effectively.
