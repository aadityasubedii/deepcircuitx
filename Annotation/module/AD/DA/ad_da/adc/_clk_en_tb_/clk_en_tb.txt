Module-level comment: The "clk_en_tb" is a testbench for simulating the 'clk_en' module, generating a clock (`clk`), an active-low reset (`rst_n`), and a control signal (`cs`) to validate its behavior under different conditions. Implementation involves toggling `clk` every 10 ns, simulating a reset sequence, and altering `cs` to test control responsiveness. This setup aims to scrutinize the 'clk_en' module's output (`sclk`) response, aiding in verifying its functional correctness.
