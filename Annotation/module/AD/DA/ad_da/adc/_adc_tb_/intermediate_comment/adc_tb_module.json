    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'adc_tb' module serves as a testbench for an ADC interface, simulating clock, reset, and data exchanges. It initializes and manages timing with internal counters and condition flags, toggling control signals like 'cs' and 'sclk' for proper ADC integration. Key functions include managing 'miso' based on binary pattern comparison and controlling execution through various sequential and combinational logic blocks, ensuring precise ADC operation verification."
