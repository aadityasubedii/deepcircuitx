Module name: adc_tb. 

Module specification: The 'adc_tb' module functions as a test bench designed specifically to simulate and test the functionality of an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) interface. It incorporates input ports such as 'clk' (clock input that synchronizes all operations), 'rsts' (ambiguous control reset), 'rst_n' (active-low reset to initialize states), 'rvs' (likely related to ADC's conversion status), and 'miso' (data from ADC to master). The output ports include 'dout' (16-bit data output from ADC), 'cs' (chip select for ADC activation), 'sclk' (serial clock for data synchronization), and 'mosi' (data/command transmission to ADC). Inside the module, various internal signals like counters ('cnt' and 'cnt1') and control flags ('add_cnt', 'end_cnt', 'add_cnt1', 'end_cnt1') manage timing and data sequence operations during communication with the ADC. The test bench setup involves initial reset manipulation, wait times, and a clock signal generator. Critical operations such as data reading via 'miso' depending on the control signals and counters, and ADC interface monitoring via signals like 'rvs' to verify conversion status. Additionally, counters and their associated control and terminal condition flags manage various phases and cycles within the data transmission and reception processes, ensuring accurate ADC simulation and testing.
