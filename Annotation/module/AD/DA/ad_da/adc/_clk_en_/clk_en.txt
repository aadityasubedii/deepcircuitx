Module-level comment: The `clk_en` module gates a clock signal (`sclk`) based on an external control (`cs`). Utilizes edge detection on `cs` to toggle a register (`clk_en`), controlling `sclk` output. Features edge detection via a shift register (`edges`), and manages clock enablement through sequential and combinational logic blocks.
