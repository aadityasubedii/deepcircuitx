The module takes a clock input `clk`, an active low reset input `rst_n`, and the control signal `cs`. It outputs a signal `sclk` that passes through the clock signal when enabled. It uses edge detection on the control signal to enable or disable the output clock. If a falling edge is detected on `cs` (`dw_edge`), the internal enable signal `clk_en` is set high, and if a rising edge is detected (`up_edge`), `clk_en` is set low. Whether the clock is passed through to `sclk` depends on the state of `clk_en`. When `clk_en` is high, `sclk` follows the input clock `clk`, and when `clk_en` is low, `sclk` is held high. The edge detection is done using a two-bit shift register `edges` that keeps track of the previous and current states of `cs` to detect edges between consecutive clock cycles. The module ensures that upon an active low reset, it initializes the register `edges` to `11` and the enable signal `clk_en` to `0`, which means that `sclk` will be held high during reset."

When this signal is low (`0`), it initializes the internal state of the module to a defined start state, ensuring that the module operates correctly from a known condition.\n- `cs`: This is the control signal input that determines when the output clock signal is enabled.

It is set or reset based on the detection of specific edges on the `cs` signal.

It helps in detecting the rising and falling edges of `cs` by storing its current and previous state. This register is shifted each clock cycle, with the current state of `cs` fed into the least significant bit.\n- `up_edge`: This is a wire derived from comparing `edges`. It indicates a rising edge on the `cs` input.
