    "spec": "Module name: clk_en.\nModule specification: The module `clk_en` is a clock gating component that outputs a gated clock signal `sclk` based on an enable control mechanism triggered by an external control signal `cs`. The module has three input ports: `clk`, the primary clock signal which the module synchronizes to; `rst_n`, an active low reset that initializes the module to a known state when asserted; and `cs`, the control signal which is monitored for edge transitions to enable or disable the clock output. The sole output port, `sclk`, is the gated clock signal which follows `clk` when enabled and is held high when disabled. Internally, the module employs a register `clk_en` as a flag to enable or disable the transmission of the clock signal to `sclk`, and a 2-bit shift register `edges` for edge detection on `cs`. When `edges` detects a rising edge, indicated by `up_edge`, or a falling edge, indicated by `dw_edge`, it respectively resets or sets `clk_en`. The code is organized into three always blocks: The first block handles the edge detection logic by updating `edges`; the second block deals with setting and resetting `clk_en` based on the detected edges or on reset; and the third block defines the logic for outputting `sclk` based on the value of `clk_en`. The combination of these functional blocks ensures that `sclk` is gated according to the edge transitions on `cs`, introducing enable functionality to the clock signal in a synchronous design.",

The module takes a clock input `clk`, an active low reset input `rst_n`, and the control signal `cs`. It outputs a signal `sclk` that passes through the clock signal when enabled. It uses edge detection on the control signal to enable or disable the output clock. If a falling edge is detected on `cs` (`dw_edge`), the internal enable signal `clk_en` is set high, and if a rising edge is detected (`up_edge`), `clk_en` is set low. Whether the clock is passed through to `sclk` depends on the state of `clk_en`. When `clk_en` is high, `sclk` follows the input clock `clk`, and when `clk_en` is low, `sclk` is held high. The edge detection is done using a two-bit shift register `edges` that keeps track of the previous and current states of `cs` to detect edges between consecutive clock cycles. The module ensures that upon an active low reset, it initializes the register `edges` to `11` and the enable signal `clk_en` to `0`, which means that `sclk` will be held high during reset."

It is set or reset based on the detection of specific edges on the `cs` signal. If a falling edge is detected, `clk_en` is set to `1` (enabling the clock), and if a rising edge is detected, `clk_en` is set to `0` (disabling the clock).\n- `edges`: This is a 2-bit register used to track the last two states of the `cs` control signal. It helps in detecting the rising and falling edges of `cs` by storing its current and previous state. This register is shifted each clock cycle, with the current state of `cs` fed into the least significant bit.\n- `up_edge`: This is a wire derived from comparing `edges`. It indicates a rising edge on the `cs` input. Specifically, `up_edge` is true (`1`) when `edges` equals `2'b01`, representing a transition from low to high in `cs`.\n- `dw_edge`: This is a wire derived from comparing `edges` as well. It flags a falling edge on the `cs` input. `dw_edge` is true (`1`) when `edges` equals `2'b10`, indicating a transition from high to low in `cs`.
