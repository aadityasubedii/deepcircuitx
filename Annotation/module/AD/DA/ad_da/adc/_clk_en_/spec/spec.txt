Module name: clk_en.
Module specification: The module `clk_en` is a clock gating component that outputs a gated clock signal `sclk` based on an enable control mechanism triggered by an external control signal `cs`. The module has three input ports: `clk`, the primary clock signal which the module synchronizes to; `rst_n`, an active low reset that initializes the module to a known state when asserted; and `cs`, the control signal which is monitored for edge transitions to enable or disable the clock output. The sole output port, `sclk`, is the gated clock signal which follows `clk` when enabled and is held high when disabled. Internally, the module employs a register `clk_en` as a flag to enable or disable the transmission of the clock signal to `sclk`, and a 2-bit shift register `edges` for edge detection on `cs`. When `edges` detects a rising edge, indicated by `up_edge`, or a falling edge, indicated by `dw_edge`, it respectively resets or sets `clk_en`. The code is organized into three always blocks: The first block handles the edge detection logic by updating `edges`; the second block deals with setting and resetting `clk_en` based on the detected edges or on reset; and the third block defines the logic for outputting `sclk` based on the value of `clk_en`. The combination of these functional blocks ensures that `sclk` is gated according to the edge transitions on `cs`, introducing enable functionality to the clock signal in a synchronous design.
