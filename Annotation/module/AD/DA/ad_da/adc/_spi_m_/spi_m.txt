Module-level comment: The `spi_m` module is an SPI master controller designed to handle read and write operations with a SPI slave. It operates based on a state machine transitioning through 'idle', 'read', and 'write' states triggered by `read_flag` and `writ_flag`. The module manages data transfer using a bit-position counter, state-specific signal assignments, and data serialization/deserialization through `mosi` and `miso` lines synchronized by a clock input. This design ensures robust and sequential data handling in SPI communications.
