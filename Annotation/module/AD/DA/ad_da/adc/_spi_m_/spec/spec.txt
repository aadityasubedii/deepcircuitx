Module name: spi_m.

Module specification: The `spi_m` module serves as a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) master controller, pivotal for facilitating SPI read and write transactions. It operates according to a state machine with designated 'idle', 'read', and 'write' states, transitioning in response to external `read_flag` and `writ_flag` signals. The input ports are `clk`, a clock that synchronizes the operations; `rst_n`, an active low reset; `read_flag` and `writ_flag`, which initiate read and write actions; `writ_data`, holding the 32-bit data for write operations; and `miso` for receiving data during reads. Output ports include `mosi`, transmitting data to the SPI slave, and `read_data`, holding the received data. Key internal signals comprise `writ_data_tmp` for latching write data; a counter `cnt` used for bit indexing; `end_cnt` to detect the transfer's end; `add_cnt` which signals when to increment `cnt`; control signals like `idle_to_read_start`, `idle_to_writ_start`, `read_to_idle_start`, and `writ_to_idle_start` guiding state transitions; and state registers `state_c`, `state_n` for managing the state machine. Clock enable (`clk_en`) and edge detection (`edges`, `cs_up`, `cs_dw`) registers are prepared but remain unused. The module's code consists of sequential blocks managing state changes and counters, combinational logic to facilitate state transitions and signal assignments, and data transfer handling, where data is shifted in or out serially through `mosi` and `miso` during write and read operations, respectively.
