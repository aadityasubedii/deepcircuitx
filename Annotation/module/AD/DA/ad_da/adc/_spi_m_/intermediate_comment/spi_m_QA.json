It operates based on a state machine with three principal states: 'idle', 'read', and 'write'. The transitions between these states are triggered by the external flags `read_flag` and `writ_flag` for initiating read and write operations, respectively. During a write operation, data from the `writ_data` input is sequentially transmitted bit-by-bit on the `mosi` line, and during a read operation, incoming bits on the `miso` line are captured into the `read_data` output. The module uses a counter to manage the bit positions during these operations and to detect when a complete set of 32 bits has been processed, thus signaling the end of an SPI transaction. Additionally, the module ensures proper handling of system resets and defines the MOSI line high-impedance state when not actively driving the line."
