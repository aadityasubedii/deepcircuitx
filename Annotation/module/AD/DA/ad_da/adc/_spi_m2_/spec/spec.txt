Module name: spi_m.
Module specification: The 'spi_m' module is designed as an SPI master controller facilitating communication over an SPI bus. It orchestrates the flow of data between master and slave devices following the SPI protocol. It handles data transmission and reception tasks, state transitions, signal edge detection, and synchronization.

The module has five input ports: 'clk' is the clock input providing timing for operations; 'rst_n' is an active-low reset to initialize the module; 'writ_flag' signals when the module has data ready to send; 'writ_data' carries a 32-bit data payload for transmission; and 'miso' is the Master In Slave Out line used for receiving data. The outputs include 'rdy', indicating the master's readiness to begin a write operation, and 'mosi', the Master Out Slave In line for data transmission to the slave device.

Internally, 'spi_m' employs a variety of signals such as 'writ_data_tmp', a buffer for outgoing data; a counter 'cnt' for bit-position tracking; 'end_cnt' and 'add_cnt' signals for counter operation; and a series of signals starting with 'idle_to_*' and '*_to_idle_start' for managing state transitions within the finite state machine (FSM). The module's FSM employs 'state_c' and 'state_n' to hold current and next states, while 'clk_en' enables clock-dependent operations. 'Edges' alongside 'cs_up' and 'cs_dw' detect chip select signal transitions for coordinated SPI bus engagement.

The FSM, constituted by sequential logic blocks, governs the transitions between idle, reading, and writing states based on control flags and command signals. Concurrent assignment blocks manage the temporary storage of data to be written, the counting logic for bit positions, and the edge-detection mechanism for the chip select signal. Procedural blocks conditionally drive the 'mosi' output and an unmentioned 'read_data' register (likely used for storing incoming data) based on the operational state of the module and the progression of the transfer counter.

Overall, the 'spi_m' module is structured to initialize the master device, handle the necessary synchronization with the SPI clock, assert control over the SPI bus, and efficiently perform read or write operations as commanded by the interfacing logic. The clear separation of concerns within the module's FSM, data handling, and synchronization logic enables reliable and standard-compliant SPI communication.
