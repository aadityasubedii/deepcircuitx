Module-level comment: The 'spi_m' module acts as an SPI master controller, managing SPI communications per protocol specifications. It utilizes input signals like 'clk', 'rst_n', 'writ_flag', 'writ_data', and 'miso' to handle data transmissions and state transitions governed by a finite state machine (FSM). Outputs include 'rdy' and 'mosi', signifying readiness and data out, respectively. Internal signals and edge-detection mechanisms control the timing and state transitions during SPI transactions.
