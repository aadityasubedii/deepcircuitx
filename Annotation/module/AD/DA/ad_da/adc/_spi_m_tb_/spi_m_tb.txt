Module-level comment: The 'spi_m_tb' module is a testbench for verifying the SPI master module 'spi_m'. It simulates SPI operations by generating clock (`clk`), reset (`rst_n`), and interface controls (`cs_key`, `read_flag`, `writ_flag`). Test scenarios input stimuli like data (`writ_data`) and monitor outputs (`read_data`, `rdy`). It employs synchronization always blocks for internal signal stability and initial blocks that sequence the SPI communication tests.
