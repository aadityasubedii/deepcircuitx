    "spec": "Module name: spi_m_tb. \n\nModule specification: The 'spi_m_tb' is a testbench module designed to verify the correct functionality of an SPI master module 'spi_m' within a simulated environment. This testbench creates the necessary clock (`clk`), reset (`rst_n`), and control signals (`cs_key`, `read_flag`, `writ_flag`) to mimic the operation of an SPI interface. It also passes data to be written (`writ_data`) and captures the returned data (`read_data`) from the SPI master. The primary inputs include the `clk` acting as the primary clock for syncing operations, the active-low `rst_n` serving as the reset signal, `cs_key` used to control chip selection, `read_flag` and `writ_flag` for driving read and write operations, `writ_data` as the data bus for outgoing data, and Master-In-Slave-Out (`miso`) for incoming data. The outputs consist of the `read_data` for incoming data, `rdy` indicating operation readiness, the serial clock (`sclk`), chip select (`sc_n`), and Master-Out-Slave-In (`mosi`). Internal signals like `cs_key_s`, `read_flag_s`, and `writ_flag_s` are synchronized versions of their respective input ports, ensuring stable internal processing in accordance with the clock domain.\n\nThe code is sectioned into distinct parts, including module instantiation, parameter definitions, always blocks for signal synchronization, and initial blocks for test sequence execution. The module instantiation defines connections between the testbench and the SPI master (`spi_m`) module. Parameters like `CYCLE` and `RST_TIME` define the clock cycle time and reset duration, respectively, which are critical for creating an accurate simulation environment. The always block is responsible for synchronizing external inputs with the module's internal clock. The initial blocks are sequences that simulate the test scenario, initializing the clock, applying the reset sequence, and performing write and read operations according to predefined test cases to validate the SPI master operation.",
