Module name: Altera_UP_PS2_Data_In. Module specification: The Altera_UP_PS2_Data_In module interfaces with a PS2 device to manage the reception of serial data through the PS2 protocol. This module operates synchronously with the provided clock input (`clk`) and can be reset via the `reset` signal. It handles various input signals such as `wait_for_incoming_data`, `start_receiving_data`, `ps2_clk_posedge`, `ps2_clk_negedge`, and `ps2_data` to facilitate the correct reception and timing of data bits, transitioning through multiple states using a finite state machine. The outputs of this module, `received_data` and `received_data_en`, provide the received data byte and a data ready signal, respectively. Internal signals like `data_count`, `data_shift_reg`, `ns_ps2_receiver`, and `s_ps2_receiver` are employed for counting received bits, storing the data byte being received, managing the next and current state of the finite state machine (FSM), respectively. The Verilog code is structured in separate always blocks that perform specific functions such as state transitions based on input signals, bit counting, data shifting, data storage, and output signal management based on the state of data reception, ensuring structured and reliable data handling in communication with PS2 devices.
