Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_PS2_Data_In module interfaces with PS2 devices to receive serial data, synchronizing with external clock and reset signals. It employs a finite state machine (FSM) to handle data reception through stages like waiting, receiving, and parity checking, using signal edge detection and bit shifting. Outputs indicate data readiness and content.
