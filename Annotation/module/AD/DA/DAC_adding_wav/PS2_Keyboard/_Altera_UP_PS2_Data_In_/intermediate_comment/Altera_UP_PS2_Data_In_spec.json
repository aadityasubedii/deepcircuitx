    "spec": "Module name: Altera_UP_PS2_Data_In. Module specification: The Altera_UP_PS2_Data_In module interfaces with a PS2 device to manage the reception of serial data through the PS2 protocol. This module operates synchronously with the provided clock input (`clk`) and can be reset via the `reset` signal. It handles various input signals such as `wait_for_incoming_data`, `start_receiving_data`, `ps2_clk_posedge`, `ps2_clk_negedge`, and `ps2_data` to facilitate the correct reception and timing of data bits, transitioning through multiple states using a finite state machine. The outputs of this module, `received_data` and `received_data_en`, provide the received data byte and a data ready signal, respectively. Internal signals like `data_count`, `data_shift_reg`, `ns_ps2_receiver`, and `s_ps2_receiver` are employed for counting received bits, storing the data byte being received, managing the next and current state of the finite state machine (FSM), respectively. The Verilog code is structured in separate always blocks that perform specific functions such as state transitions based on input signals, bit counting, data shifting, data storage, and output signal management based on the state of data reception, ensuring structured and reliable data handling in communication with PS2 devices.",

It receives PS2 clock and data signals, and it is responsible for managing the different stages of data reception which includes waiting for incoming data, receiving the data bits, checking the parity bit, and identifying the stop bit. Once a complete data byte is received and the stop bit is detected, the module signals that the byte is ready to be read by setting the `received_data_en` high and making the byte available on the `received_data` output. The module operates synchronously with a provided `clk` input and can be reset through a `reset` signal. It uses a finite state machine (FSM) to transition through states for idle, waiting for data, reading the data, checking parity, and receiving the stop bit. The FSM ensures the correct sequence of operations for reliable data acquisition from a PS2 interface."

It is used to time the state transitions and data capturing in the module.\n- `reset`: This is the reset input, which when asserted (`1'b1`), initializes the module's internal states and counters, effectively resetting the FSM and data shift register.\n- `wait_for_incoming_data`: When asserted, the module will enter a state where it waits for the start of incoming data, indicated by the PS2 data line.\n- `start_receiving_data`: When asserted, the module will assume data is ready to be received and start the reception process immediately, without waiting for an indication on the PS2 data line.\n- `ps2_clk_posedge`: This input signals a positive edge of the PS2 clock. It is used by the module to time the bit reception process.\n- `ps2_clk_negedge`: This input signals a negative edge of the PS2 clock. Although provided in the port list, it is not used in the module logic as per the provided code.\n- `ps2_data`: This is the data input from the PS2 device. Bits are read from this line on the positive edges of the PS2 clock.\n\nOutput ports: `received_data`, `received_data_en`.\n\nExplanation:\n- `received_data`: This is an 8-bit wide output port that holds the last byte of data received from the PS2 device once the stop bit has been detected and the data received is ready.\n- `received_data_en`: This output is a signal that, when high (`1'b1`), indicates that a new byte of data has been received and is available on the `received_data` port for reading."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: `data_count`, `data_shift_reg`, `ns_ps2_receiver`, `s_ps2_receiver`.\n\nExplanation:\n- `data_count`: This register counts the number of data bits received. It is incremented on every positive edge of the PS2 clock (`ps2_clk_posedge`) when the module is in the data reception state (`PS2_STATE_2_DATA_IN`). It is reset to zero when not in the data reception state.\n\n- `data_shift_reg`: This 8-bit register is used as a shift register to assemble the incoming bits into a full byte. As each bit is received on the positive edge of the PS2 clock while the module is in the data reception state, it is shifted into this register from the least significant end, thereby collecting the full byte serially from the PS2 data line.\n\n- `ns_ps2_receiver`: This register represents the \"next state\" of the module's finite state machine (FSM). It is updated in a combinational always block based on the current state and the inputs signaling the conditions for state transitions. This approach of using a next state signal helps in clearly defining the transitions of the FSM based on various conditions in a structured manner.\n\n- `s_ps2_receiver`: This register holds the \"current state\" of the FSM. It is updated with the `ns_ps2_receiver` (next state) at every positive edge of the clock (`clk`), subject to the reset condition. This state dictates the operations and checks to be performed by the FSM, governing the reception process, parity check, and finalization of data reception in the module."

Module specification: The Altera_UP_PS2_Data_In module interfaces with a PS2 device to manage the reception of serial data through the PS2 protocol. This module operates synchronously with the provided clock input (`clk`) and can be reset via the `reset` signal. It handles various input signals such as `wait_for_incoming_data`, `start_receiving_data`, `ps2_clk_posedge`, `ps2_clk_negedge`, and `ps2_data` to facilitate the correct reception and timing of data bits, transitioning through multiple states using a finite state machine. The outputs of this module, `received_data` and `received_data_en`, provide the received data byte and a data ready signal, respectively. Internal signals like `data_count`, `data_shift_reg`, `ns_ps2_receiver`, and `s_ps2_receiver` are employed for counting received bits, storing the data byte being received, managing the next and current state of the finite state machine (FSM), respectively. The Verilog code is structured in separate always blocks that perform specific functions such as state transitions based on input signals, bit counting, data shifting, data storage, and output signal management based on the state of data reception, ensuring structured and reliable data handling in communication with PS2 devices."
