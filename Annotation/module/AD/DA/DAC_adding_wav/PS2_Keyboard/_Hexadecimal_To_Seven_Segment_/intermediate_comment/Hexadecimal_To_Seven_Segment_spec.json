    "spec": "Module name: Hexadecimal_To_Seven_Segment. Module specification: The Hexadecimal_To_Seven_Segment module is designed to convert a 4-bit hexadecimal number into a 7-segment display pattern suitable for visualization on digital displays. It takes a 4-bit input `hex_number` which represents the hexadecimal value to be displayed. The module outputs a `seven_seg_display`, a 7-bit pattern where each bit corresponds to one of the segments (A to G) of a 7-segment display. A bit value of '0' or '1' controls the on/off state of each segment, thereby representing the hexadecimal digit on the display. Internally, the module does not utilize any intermediate signals. Instead, it employs a direct assignment using a combinational logic block where a combination of conditional ternary operations (`{}` for replication and `==` for comparison), and bitwise operations (`&` and `|`) are applied to derive the display pattern based solely on the input `hex_number`. This block meticulously maps each hexadecimal digit to its corresponding 7-segment display configuration using a sequence of bitwise AND and OR operations to set the correct pattern on `seven_seg_display`.",

Each segment of the display is controlled by a bit in the 7-bit output, where each pattern corresponds to the hexadecimal representation of numbers from 0 to F. Each hexadecimal value maps to a unique configuration of the seven segment display, enabling it to visually represent the number on a digital display.
