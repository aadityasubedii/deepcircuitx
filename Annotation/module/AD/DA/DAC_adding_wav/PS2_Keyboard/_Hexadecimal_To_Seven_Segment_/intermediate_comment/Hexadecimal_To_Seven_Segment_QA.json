Each segment of the display is controlled by a bit in the 7-bit output, where each pattern corresponds to the hexadecimal representation of numbers from 0 to F. Each hexadecimal value maps to a unique configuration of the seven segment display, enabling it to visually represent the number on a digital display. The assignment uses bitwise operations and masking (using the `{}` replication and `&` bitwise AND) to select the correct 7-bit pattern for the given hexadecimal input."
