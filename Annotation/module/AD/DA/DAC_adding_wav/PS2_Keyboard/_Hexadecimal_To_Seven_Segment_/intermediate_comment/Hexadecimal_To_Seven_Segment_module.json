    "module": "Module-level comment: The Hexadecimal_To_Seven_Segment module converts a 4-bit hex number ('hex_number') into a 7-bit segment pattern ('seven_seg_display') for 7-segment displays. It uses combinatorial logic with bitwise operations and conditional replication to map each hex input to its corresponding display pattern efficiently, directly assigning to 'seven_seg_display' without intermediate signals."
