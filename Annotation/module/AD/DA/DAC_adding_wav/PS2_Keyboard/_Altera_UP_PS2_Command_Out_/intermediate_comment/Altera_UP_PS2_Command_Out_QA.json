It manages the entire communication process, including initializing the communication, waiting for the PS2 clock, transmitting data and stop bit, and receiving an acknowledgment bit. The module also handles timeout errors if communication fails within specified time limits. Feedback signals indicate whether a command was successfully sent or if there was a timeout error in communication."

It increments each time a new bit is transmitted to the PS2 device.\n- ps2_command: A 9-bit register that holds the command to be sent to the PS2 device. The command from the `the_command` input is manipulated for parity and then stored in this register.\n- command_initiate_counter: A counter used to manage the timing for initiating communication with the PS2 device. It counts a specific period (101 microseconds) necessary before the communication starts.\n- waiting_counter: A counter to handle the wait time between the start of the communication and the actual data transmission. It ensures the module waits for up to 15 milliseconds to detect the PS2 clock line's response.\n- transfer_counter: This counter is used during the data transmission phases. It helps in managing the time duration each bit should be held stable on the data line (lasting 2 milliseconds) before considering a timeout error.\n- ns_ps2_transmitter: A next-state signal for the PS2 transmission state machine. It determines the next state of the module based on the current state and the inputs.\n- s_ps2_transmitter: The current state signal of the PS2 transmission state machine.
