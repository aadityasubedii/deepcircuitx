Module name: Altera_UP_PS2_Command_Out. Module specification: The Altera_UP_PS2_Command_Out module is designed to manage the communication process with a PS2 device, handling the transmission of commands and monitoring for acknowledgments or timeout errors. The module operates using several input ports: 'clk' for clock signals, 'reset' for resetting the module's state, 'the_command' for the 8-bit command to be sent, 'send_command' to initiate transmission, and 'ps2_clk_posedge' and 'ps2_clk_negedge' to detect the PS2 clock's edges. Output ports include 'PS2_CLK' and 'PS2_DAT' for synchronization and data transmission, and 'command_was_sent' and 'error_communication_timed_out' for providing status feedback. Internally, the module utilizes signals like 'cur_bit' to track current bit position in transmission, 'ps2_command' to hold the processed command, counters ('command_initiate_counter', 'waiting_counter', 'transfer_counter') for managing various timing aspects during initialization, waiting, and transmission phases, and state control signals ('ns_ps2_transmitter', 's_ps2_transmitter') for state machine operations. The code structure incorporates initialization of communication, waiting for clock stability, data transmission handling, stop bit transmission, acknowledgment reception, and error handling in the transmission, structured effectively using a state machine with explicit state control and transitions based on the PS2 clock and internal counters.
