It operates based on a state machine that manages different phases of data communication including idle, data receiving, command sending, and transfer completion. The module uses signals to detect rising and falling edges of the PS2 clock to synchronize data transmission, handles commands sent to the PS2 device, and processes incoming data. Additionally, it can detect and manage timeouts or errors in communication. The module interfaces with external components through the `PS2_CLK` and `PS2_DAT` lines, and provides outgoing signals indicating the status of commands sent, data received, and any communication errors."
