Module-level comment: The PS2_Controller module interfaces with PS2 devices, handling data transmission and reception. It operates based on a state machine that responds to input commands, manages data signaling with a PS2 device and synchronizes communication via edge detection on the PS2 clock line. Outputs indicate command success, data validity, and timeouts.
