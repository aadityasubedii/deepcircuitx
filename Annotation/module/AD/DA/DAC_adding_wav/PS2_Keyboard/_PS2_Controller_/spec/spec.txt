Module name: PS2_Controller. 

Module specification: The PS2_Controller is a Verilog module designed to manage communication with PS2 devices, such as keyboards and mice, through a state machine. The module operates with input ports including `CLOCK_50`, the system clock that synchronizes the operations within the module; `reset`, which re-initializes the module's state machine; `the_command`, an 8-bit signal carrying commands to the PS2 device; and `send_command`, a trigger signal for command transmission. The output ports include `command_was_sent` and `error_communication_timed_out` signals to indicate the status of command transmission and communication errors, respectively, alongside `received_data` and `received_data_en` to convey the data received from the PS2 device and its validity. Internal to the module, various signals such as `ps2_clk_posedge` and `ps2_clk_negedge` are utilized for clock edge detection, `idle_counter` for managing delay in the idle state, and `ns_ps2_transceiver` and `s_ps2_transceiver` manage the state machine logic. The module employs a finite state machine with states for idle operation, data reception, command sending, transfer completion, and delayed end transition, managing the transitions based on the input commands, the PS2 clock, and the data line status. Incorporating the `Altera_UP_PS2_Data_In` submodule, the PS2_Controller effectively handles incoming data processing based on the synchronization signals, facilitating robust communication with PS2 peripherals. This structured approach to handling PS2 communication leveraging internal state management, edge detection for synchronization, and effective separation of data processing tasks allows for an organized and efficient interfacing with PS2 devices.
