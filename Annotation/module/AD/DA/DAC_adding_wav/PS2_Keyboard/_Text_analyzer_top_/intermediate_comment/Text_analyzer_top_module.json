    "module": "Module-level comment: The PS2_Demo module interfaces with a PS2 keyboard to capture and display key presses on seven-segment displays. It uses a 50 MHz clock, reset, and switch inputs, alongside PS2 communication lines. The module decodes key presses, transitions through a finite state machine to log the last three keys, and visualizes them and the 'enter' press via connected display drivers and LED indicators."
