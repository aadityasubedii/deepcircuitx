The module takes inputs from the CLOCK_50 (system clock), reset, switch array (SW), PS2 clock (PS2_CLK), and PS2 data (PS2_DAT). It outputs the detected scan codes (code1, code2, code3) corresponding to the last three keys pressed before the enter key is pressed, to seven-segment displays (HEX0 to HEX5) and LEDs (LEDG for indicating a key press and LEDR for additional status and state indications). The module processes PS2 keyboard inputs to capture and decode key press events, transitioning through a finite state machine to manage the sequence of pressed keys, with specific behavior driven by the enter key. Once the enter key is detected after a series of key inputs, it indicates the completion of an input sequence, making the codes available for display. This module effectively demonstrates the real-time processing and visualization of data from a PS2 keyboard."
