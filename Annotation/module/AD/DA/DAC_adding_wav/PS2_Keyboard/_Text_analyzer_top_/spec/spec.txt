Module name: PS2_Demo. 

Module specification: The PS2_Demo module is a Verilog hardware design that interfaces with a PS2 keyboard and visualizes the scan codes of keypresses on seven-segment displays. It utilizes a 50 MHz system clock (CLOCK_50) for timing, a reset signal for initialization, an 18-bit switch array (SW) for control inputs, and PS2 clock (PS2_CLK) and data (PS2_DAT) lines for communication with the keyboard. Output signals include a 'go' signal indicating the completion of a keypress sequence, three 8-bit codes (code1, code2, code3) representing the last three keys pressed, 7-bit outputs to six seven-segment displays (HEX0 to HEX5) to display codes and status, and an 8-bit green LED array (LEDG) and an 18-bit red LED array (LEDR) for additional status indications. Internal signals such as `ps2_key_data` for the current key data, `ps2_key_pressed` signaling a key press, `change` for data changes, `last_data_received` storing last data byte, `new_keycode` and `scan_code` holding key codes, `ps2_key_released` flag signaling key release, state control signals (`state`, `n_state`, `clear`, `display`, `complete_key_in`), and counters `counter` are used for processing and FSM control. The module contains a PS2 controller for handling PS2 data, a state machine that transitions through states waiting for the Enter key and logging up to three keypresses, and support for displaying the scan codes and enter press on seven-segment displays via specialized sub-modules `alphabet_to_seven_segments` and `Go_to_seven_segments`.
