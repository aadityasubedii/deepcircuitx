Module specification: The `alphabet_to_seven_segments` module is designed to convert specific 8-bit input values, represented by the `number` input port, into a 7-bit output for a seven-segment display, detailed by the `seven_seg_display` output port. The fundamental operation of this module is the mapping of certain input values to predetermined patterns on the seven-segment display, which portrays various characters or symbols. The `number` port accepts an 8-bit signal where each unique value correlates to a specific configuration of segments illuminated on the display. In contrast, the `seven_seg_display` port delivers a 7-bit output corresponding to each segment of the display with activated bits (0 or 1) controlling whether segments are off or on. Internally, the module does not utilize named intermediate signals; instead, it leverages direct combinational logic within a continuous assignment statement using bitwise operations and comparisons to determine the display output. The code divides into major blocks of conditional mappings each enclosed within a single large assignment statement, ensuring that for each recognized input value, a specific pattern is output to the seven-segment display, while a default pattern (all segments lit) is provided for unrecognized inputs. This setup provides a clear, efficient mapping mechanism that suits applications needing alphanumeric or symbolic display on basic digital readout equipment.",

The mapping is accomplished through a set of conditional assignments, where particular bit patterns on the input correspond to defined segments being lit on a seven-segment display to presumably represent characters or symbols. If an input value does not match any predefined mappings, it defaults to lighting up all segments (displaying `7'b1111111`).
