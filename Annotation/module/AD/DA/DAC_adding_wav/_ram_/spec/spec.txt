Module name: ram.

Module specification: The "ram" module simulates a simple Random Access Memory (RAM) functionality within a digital system, capable of performing read and write operations with a default data size of 32 bits. It operates under the synchronization of a `clock` signal and can be reset asynchronously through the `reset` input. When the `write1_read0` input is high, the module writes data from the `data_in` port into the memory array `register`, indexed by an internal `address` counter. Conversely, when `write1_read0` is low, it reads data from the memory location pointed by `address` and outputs it via the `data_out_display` port. The module's internal mechanism is segmented into major blocks governed by the clock and reset signals. The first block monitors the clock's positive edge and the reset's negative edge to increment the `address` counter or reset it to 0, respectively. The second block, triggered by the clock's positive edge, manages the read/write operations based on the state of `write1_read0`. Internal signals, namely the `address` counter and the `register` array (holding 65536 locations for data of size `data_size` bits), facilitate access and manipulation of data stored within the module. This design encapsulates the fundamental aspects of memory operation in hardware designs, providing a versatile and functional RAM simulation.
