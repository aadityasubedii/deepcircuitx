    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"ram\" module simulates a synchronous RAM, supporting both read and write operations. It uses an internal address counter to index a memory array, coordinating data access through a positive-edge-triggered clock and an asynchronous reset. Control input `write1_read0` selects between writing `data_in` to or reading from the array to `data_out_display`."
