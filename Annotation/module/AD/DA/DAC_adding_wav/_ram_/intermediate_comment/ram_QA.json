It is designed to perform read and write operations based on the input signals. The module leverages a synchronous design with a clock signal `clock` and an asynchronous reset `reset`. When the `write1_read0` input is high, it writes the data present on `data_in` into a memory location indexed by an internal address counter `address`. Conversely, when `write1_read0` is low, it reads data from the memory location indexed by the `address` counter and outputs it through `data_out_display`. The address counter is incremented with each clock cycle if the reset is not active, and it is reset to 0 upon the activation of the `reset` signal. This setup allows for sequential access to the memory array named `register`, which has a depth of 65536 locations, each capable of storing `data_size`-bit data."

When active (low), it resets the internal address counter `address` to 0, effectively reinitializing the module's state.\n- `write1_read0`: A control signal that determines the operation mode of the module. When high (1), the module performs a write operation, storing the data from `data_in` into the memory. When low (0), the module performs a read operation.\n- `data_in`: This input port is used to receive data that will be written into the memory array if `write1_read0` is set to write mode.\n\nOutput ports: data_out_display.\nExplanation:\n- `data_out_display`: This output port displays the data read from the memory array when `write1_read0` is in read mode.
