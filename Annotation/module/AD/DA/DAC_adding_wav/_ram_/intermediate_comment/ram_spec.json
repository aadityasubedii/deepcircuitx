It operates under the synchronization of a `clock` signal and can be reset asynchronously through the `reset` input. When the `write1_read0` input is high, the module writes data from the `data_in` port into the memory array `register`, indexed by an internal `address` counter. Conversely, when `write1_read0` is low, it reads data from the memory location pointed by `address` and outputs it via the `data_out_display` port. The module's internal mechanism is segmented into major blocks governed by the clock and reset signals. The first block monitors the clock's positive edge and the reset's negative edge to increment the `address` counter or reset it to 0, respectively. The second block, triggered by the clock's positive edge, manages the read/write operations based on the state of `write1_read0`. Internal signals, namely the `address` counter and the `register` array (holding 65536 locations for data of size `data_size` bits), facilitate access and manipulation of data stored within the module.

It is designed to perform read and write operations based on the input signals. The module leverages a synchronous design with a clock signal `clock` and an asynchronous reset `reset`. When the `write1_read0` input is high, it writes the data present on `data_in` into a memory location indexed by an internal address counter `address`. Conversely, when `write1_read0` is low, it reads data from the memory location indexed by the `address` counter and outputs it through `data_out_display`. The address counter is incremented with each clock cycle if the reset is not active, and it is reset to 0 upon the activation of the `reset` signal. This setup allows for sequential access to the memory array named `register`, which has a depth of 65536 locations, each capable of storing `data_size`-bit data."

When active (low), it resets the internal address counter `address` to 0, effectively reinitializing the module's state.\n- `write1_read0`: A control signal that determines the operation mode of the module.
