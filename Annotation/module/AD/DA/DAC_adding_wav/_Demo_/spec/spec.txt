Module name: DE2_Audio_Example. Module specification: The DE2_Audio_Example is designed for audio processing and interaction on a DE2 FPGA board. It handles audio input and output, processes sound by integrating generated sound waves, and allows user interaction through hardware interfaces. The module receives audio via the AUD_ADCDAT input, and outputs processed audio through AUD_DACDAT. It is synchronized using CLOCK_50 and CLOCK_27 inputs, while user inputs are taken via KEY (push-buttons) and SW (switches). Audio processing is supported by internal signals such as audio_in_available, left_channel_audio_in, and right_channel_audio_out which manage audio data flow and processing stages. The module encapsulates various functional blocks: Audio_Controller handles the core audio input/output processing; avconf configures audio settings through I2C; PS2_Demo interacts with PS2 devices for additional control inputs; and blocks like sound_wave1, sound_wave2, and sound_wave3, generate sound waves based on user input. Information is displayed using HEX0 to HEX5 for seven-segment displays, and status is indicated through LEDR and LEDG outputs. The integration with external DRAM is facilitated by numerous DRAM_* signals for memory management. This extensive integration enables the module to perform complex audio processing tasks and user interactions efficiently on an FPGA platform.
