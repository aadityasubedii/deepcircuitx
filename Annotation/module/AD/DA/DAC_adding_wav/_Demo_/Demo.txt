Module-level comment: The DE2_Audio_Example module is designed for audio I/O processing on a DE2 board. It leverages a 50MHz clock to handle ADC/DAC operations for audio, utilizes user input from switches and PS2 to generate and modify sound, and displays status on LEDs and seven-segment displays. Internal blocks manage audio data flow, synchronization, I2C configuration, and sound generation, all working together to create an interactive audio processing system.
