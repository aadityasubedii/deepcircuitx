Module name: I2C_Controller.

Module specification: The I2C_Controller module is designed to orchestrate I2C data transfers by managing clock and data signals for communication with I2C devices. It operates based on a variety of input signals, which include: CLOCK (system clock for synchronization), I2C_DATA (24-bit bus for data transfer), GO (trigger for starting the transfer), RESET (resets the module), W_R (determines data transfer direction, though its use is not explicit in this code), and I2C_SDAT (bidirectional I2C data line). The output ports are I2C_SCLK (I2C clock line), END (signals end of data transfer), ACK (acknowledgment signal from three stages), and SD_COUNTER (tracks state progress in data transfer). Internal signals such as SDO (holds data bit to send), SCLK (state control for I2C clock), END, and SD_COUNTER manage the timing and data serialization, while registers ACK1, ACK2, and ACK3 collect individual acknowledgment bits during transactions. The code has a primary block handling two main conditions: reset-specific initialization and data transmission actions sequenced by SD_COUNTER values. Each transmission phase includes setting data bits, generating clock signals, handling acknowledgments, and signaling the end of transmission. The meticulously structured Verilog procedure ensures precise timing and proper sequence of operations required for I2C communication.
