    "spec": "Module name: I2C_Controller.\n\nModule specification: The I2C_Controller module is designed to orchestrate I2C data transfers by managing clock and data signals for communication with I2C devices. It operates based on a variety of input signals, which include: CLOCK (system clock for synchronization), I2C_DATA (24-bit bus for data transfer), GO (trigger for starting the transfer), RESET (resets the module), W_R (determines data transfer direction, though its use is not explicit in this code), and I2C_SDAT (bidirectional I2C data line). The output ports are I2C_SCLK (I2C clock line), END (signals end of data transfer), ACK (acknowledgment signal from three stages), and SD_COUNTER (tracks state progress in data transfer). Internal signals such as SDO (holds data bit to send), SCLK (state control for I2C clock), END, and SD_COUNTER manage the timing and data serialization, while registers ACK1, ACK2, and ACK3 collect individual acknowledgment bits during transactions. The code has a primary block handling two main conditions: reset-specific initialization and data transmission actions sequenced by SD_COUNTER values. Each transmission phase includes setting data bits, generating clock signals, handling acknowledgments, and signaling the end of transmission. The meticulously structured Verilog procedure ensures precise timing and proper sequence of operations required for I2C communication.",

It controls the I2C clock (I2C_SCLK) and data signals (I2C_SDAT) for communicating with other I2C devices. The module uses input signals such as CLOCK, I2C_DATA, GO, RESET, and W_R to manage the data transmission process. The sequence and timing of the I2C bus signals are managed statefully, using an internal counter (SD_COUNTER) to track the progress of the transmission. The functionality includes sending a data byte split across multiple states, generating acknowledge bits (ACK relative to ACK1, ACK2, ACK3), and setting an end signal (END) once the data transaction is completed. The operation is sensitive to positive clock edges and negative reset signal edges, ensuring proper signal timing and system reset capability."

It is used to read data from and write data to the I2C bus.\n\nOutput ports: I2C_SCLK, END, ACK, SD_COUNTER, SDO.\nExplanation: \n- I2C_SCLK: This output signal is the I2C serial clock line that controls the timing of data transfer on the I2C bus.\n- END: This active-high output signal indicates the completion of an I2C data transfer operation.\n- ACK: This active-high output signal represents a logical OR of three acknowledgment register stages (ACK1, ACK2, ACK3) used to indicate whether an acknowledgment has been received after a byte transfer.\n- SD_COUNTER: This is a 6-bit output counter used within the module to track the current state of the data transfer process.\n- SDO: This output signal reflects the current data bit to be sent out to I2C_SDAT, serving as an internal data output register."

It is essential for serializing the data bits to the I2C data line bit by bit according to the I2C protocol and state progression.\n\n- SCLK: This register controls the internal state of the I2C serial clock signal. Upon certain conditions defined in the state machine, it aids in generating the appropriate clock pulses for synchronization of data transfer over the I2C bus.\n\n- END: This is a register signal used to indicate the completion of the I2C data transfer operation. When set high, it signals that data transfer has finalized, and the module is ready for a new operation or to be reset.\n\n- SD: This 24-bit register temporarily holds the I2C data being transferred. At the beginning of the data cycle, it is loaded with the data from I2C_DATA input and is then serialized by shifting out bits individually to SDO.\n\n- SD_COUNTER: This is a 6-bit counter used to track the current state or phase of the data transfer process. It sequences through the states of the module's operation, controlling timing and execution of data transfer and acknowledge bit processing.\n\n- ACK1, ACK2, ACK3: These register signals individually capture acknowledgment bits that are received during different stages of the I2C transaction. They are used to monitor if the connected I2C device has acknowledged the data transfer. The overall acknowledgment to the controller's operation (ACK) is derived by logically OR-ing these three internal signals."
