    "module": "Module-level comment: The I2C_Controller module facilitates I2C data transactions by controlling clock and data signals for I2C communication, utilizing input signals like CLOCK, I2C_DATA, GO, RESET, W_R, and I2C_SDAT. Outputs include I2C_SCLK, END, ACK, alongside internal management through SDO, SCLK, ACKx registers, and SD_COUNTER. It sequences operations via a state machine, handling initialization, data bit transmission, acknowledgment processing, and transaction completion signaling, ensuring synchronized and stateful I2C interactions."
