Module name: avconf. 

Module specification: The 'avconf' module is designed to configure audio codec settings via an I2C interface, intended for multimedia or communication device applications. It accepts inputs from a system clock (`CLOCK_50`) operating at 50 MHz, an active-low reset signal (`reset`), a volume control key (`volume_key`), a sound source selector (`sound_select`), and a sampling rate selector (`sampling_rate_select`). The module outputs an I2C clock signal (`I2C_SCLK`) and controls a bidirectional I2C data line (`I2C_SDAT`). Internally, the module uses various signals such as `mI2C_CLK_DIV` to divide the system clock into a suitable I2C controller clock (`mI2C_CTRL_CLK`), and `mI2C_DATA` which holds the codec configuration data. Control signals like `mI2C_GO`, `mI2C_END`, and `mI2C_ACK` manage data transfers on the I2C interface. It also uses lookup tables (`LUT_DATA`) to store codec configuration settings that are indexed by `LUT_INDEX` and transmitted in sequences managed by a state machine (`mSetup_ST`). The code segments include initialization blocks to set up internal registers and clocks on reset, event-driven blocks to capture inputs and adjust settings such as volume, and procedural blocks that handle the sequence of data transmission for setting up the audio codec. These functionalities collectively ensure that the audio codec is correctly initialized and configured to meet the selected audio criteria, such as volume and sampling rate.
