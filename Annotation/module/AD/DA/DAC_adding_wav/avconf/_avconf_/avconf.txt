Module-level comment: The 'avconf' module configures an audio codec via I2C, initializing registers and managing volume, audio source, and sampling rate. It uses a clock divider, state-machine-driven I2C data transmission, and lookup tables to sequence audio setup parameters, controlling the codec with system clock and input synchronized events.
