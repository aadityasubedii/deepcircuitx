Module name: Audio_Bit_Counter. 

Module specification: The Audio_Bit_Counter module is designed primarily for managing audio bitstreams by tracking the progress of bits through a countdown mechanism. It interfaces with several input signals â€” `clk` (the main clock signal that synchronizes the module's operations), `reset` (resets the module's state and outputs), `bit_clk_rising_edge` and `bit_clk_falling_edge` (signals indicating the rising and falling edges of the bit clock, crucial for handling the audio data bitstream), and `left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge` (signals for the rising and falling edges of the left-right clock, used for transitioning between audio channels). The module provides a single output, `counting`, which acts as a flag to signal the counting state of the bit counter, indicating active handling of an audio bitstream when high. Internally, the module uses two signals: `reset_bit_counter`, a wire that triggers the resetting of `bit_counter` upon transitions in the left-right clock, and `bit_counter`, a register that keeps the current count, decrementing on each bit clock's falling edge unless reset. The code includes blocks handling resets and the main counting logic: on every positive edge of the main clock, the logic checks for reset conditions to either clear or initialize `bit_counter` and update the `counting` output based on `bit_counter`'s state and the presence of bit clock falling edges. A separate assignment statement defines the condition for resetting the bit counter based on the left-right clock edges. This modular design efficiently supports timing and synchronization in audio bitstream processing tasks, such as data serialization or deserialization.
