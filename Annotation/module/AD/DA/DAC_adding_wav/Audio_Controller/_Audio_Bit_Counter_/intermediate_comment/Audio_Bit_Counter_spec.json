    "spec": "Module name: Audio_Bit_Counter. \n\nModule specification: The Audio_Bit_Counter module is designed primarily for managing audio bitstreams by tracking the progress of bits through a countdown mechanism. It interfaces with several input signals \u2014 `clk` (the main clock signal that synchronizes the module's operations), `reset` (resets the module's state and outputs), `bit_clk_rising_edge` and `bit_clk_falling_edge` (signals indicating the rising and falling edges of the bit clock, crucial for handling the audio data bitstream), and `left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge` (signals for the rising and falling edges of the left-right clock, used for transitioning between audio channels). The module provides a single output, `counting`, which acts as a flag to signal the counting state of the bit counter, indicating active handling of an audio bitstream when high. Internally, the module uses two signals: `reset_bit_counter`, a wire that triggers the resetting of `bit_counter` upon transitions in the left-right clock, and `bit_counter`, a register that keeps the current count, decrementing on each bit clock's falling edge unless reset. The code includes blocks handling resets and the main counting logic: on every positive edge of the main clock, the logic checks for reset conditions to either clear or initialize `bit_counter` and update the `counting` output based on `bit_counter`'s state and the presence of bit clock falling edges. A separate assignment statement defines the condition for resetting the bit counter based on the left-right clock edges. This modular design efficiently supports timing and synchronization in audio bitstream processing tasks, such as data serialization or deserialization.",

It operates on a clock signal (clk) and asserts a 'counting' signal as long as the internal bit_counter, initialized with the parameter `BIT_COUNTER_INIT`, is nonzero. The bit_counter decrements on each falling edge of a bit clock signal (bit_clk_falling_edge) and is reset to the initialization value on either rising or falling edges of a separate left-right clock signal (left_right_clk_rising_edge or left_right_clk_falling_edge). When reset, either by an external reset signal (reset) or by one of the left-right clock edges, the counting output is affected accordingly\u2014it is set to '0' when the external reset is asserted, while set to '1' when internal reset conditions are met. If the bit_counter reaches zero, counting is also set to '0'.
