    "module": "Module-level comment: The Audio_Bit_Counter module manages audio bitstreams by counting audio bits, synchronized by a main clock. It utilizes input signals for main, reset, bit, and left-right clocks to control the countdown and state transition of an internal bit counter. It outputs a `counting` signal indicating active audio bit handling. The module resets and adjusts the counter based on clock edges, ensuring precise synchronization and effective audio processing."
