    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sound_wave` module converts an 8-bit character input (`alphabet`) into a 16-bit sound wave signal (`sound`). Using a case statement, it maps characters to predefined frequency parameters which the `sine_stepper` submodule uses to generate the sound wave. The output is enabled by the `go` signal, ensuring `sound` only carries the wave when active."
