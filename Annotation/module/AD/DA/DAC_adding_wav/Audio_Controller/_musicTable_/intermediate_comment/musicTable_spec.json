    "spec": "Module name: sound_wave. Module specification: The `sound_wave` module primarily translates an 8-bit input `alphabet` into a sound frequency based on pre-defined mappings, outputting a 16-bit sound wave through the `sound` port, guided by an enable signal `go`. The input ports include `clock`, which is essential for driving the sequential blocks within the module, `alphabet` which determines the frequency of the output sound by representing different characters, and `go` which controls whether the output sound is transmitted or set to zero. Internally, the module uses a 2-bit `reg` type signal `frequency` to store the computed frequency value, a 16-bit `wire` type signal `wave` that represents the `sine_stepper` output, and an implied signal `step` that probably manages the stepping through the sine wave generation in the `sine_stepper` submodule. The case block in the Verilog code defines how specific characters in `alphabet` are mapped to corresponding frequency settings using parameters like `a_frequency`, `b_frequency`, etc., to control the sound output. Additionally, there is a continuous assignment that sets `sound` to either the generated `wave` or zero depending on the state of `go`. The `sine_stepper` submodule is crucial for generating the actual sine wave based on the frequency determined by the internal logic. This module efficiently integrates signal processing with conditional output generation to create varying sound frequencies based on input character codes.",

When the `go` input is asserted (high), the module assigns the `wave` value to `sound`; otherwise, `sound` is set to zero. The frequency for the sound generation is determined by a case statement that maps specific characters of the `alphabet` to predetermined frequency parameters (e.g., `a_frequency`, `b_frequency`, etc.). The frequency is then likely used by the `sine_stepper` submodule (instantiated at the end of the module) to create a sine wave at the specified frequency. The `sine_stepper` presumably steps through a sine wave at the given frequency and outputs the current value of the wave to `sound`."

The `alphabet` input accepts an 8-bit value, which seems intended to represent different characters or instructions; this input is used to determine the frequency of the sound wave to be generated based on predefined mappings. The `go` input acts as an enable signal; when it is high (`1`), the sound output `wave` from the `sine_stepper` is passed to the output; otherwise, the output is zero (`0`).\n\nOutput ports: `sound`.\nExplanation: The output `sound` is a 16-bit signal that carries the sound wave generated by the `sine_stepper` submodule. The actual value of `sound` depends on the state of the `go` input; if `go` is high, `sound` will output the wave generated by the `sine_stepper`, otherwise it outputs zero.
