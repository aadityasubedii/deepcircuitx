    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer deserializes serial audio data into parallel channels (left/right) using system clocked FIFOs. It captures data on bit and left/right clock edges, synchronizes channels, and manages FIFOs to ensure lossless data flow. Parameters like audio width are configurable for flexibility."
