It operates by reading serial audio input data on designated clock edges, stores it into internal FIFOs (First In First Out memory structures) separately for left and right audio channels, and allows reading of this parallelized audio data. The module operates synchronously with a system clock and involves edge detection for either rising or falling edges to correctly time the data capture. FIFO buffers report their status, like being full or empty, which helps in managing the flow of data, ensuring synchronous operations without data loss under varying buffer conditions. Additionally, parameters such as audio data width and bit counter initialization are customizable, allowing flexibility in different audio processing scenarios."
