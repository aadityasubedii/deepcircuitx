Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer.

Module specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer module is designed to deserialize serial audio input data into parallel format across left and right audio channels. It features a set of input ports including the system clock (`clk`), asynchronous reset (`reset`), bit clock edge detection (`bit_clk_rising_edge` and `bit_clk_falling_edge`), clock edge detection for alternating left and right audio channels (`left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge`), channel synchronization completion (`done_channel_sync`), serial audio input data (`serial_audio_in_data`), and read enable signals for each audio data channel (`read_left_audio_data_en` and `read_right_audio_data_en`). The output ports consist of the FIFO buffer read space indicators for each channel (`left_audio_fifo_read_space`, `right_audio_fifo_read_space`) and the parallel output audio data for left and right channels (`left_channel_data`, `right_channel_data`). 

Internally, the module employs signals for valid audio input detection (`valid_audio_input`), FIFO empty and full status (`left_channel_fifo_is_empty`, `right_channel_fifo_is_empty`, `left_channel_fifo_is_full`, `right_channel_fifo_is_full`), FIFO used space (`left_channel_fifo_used`, `right_channel_fifo_used`), and a shift register for incoming serial data (`data_in_shift_reg`). These signals aid in managing data flow and synchronization within the module.

The code is organized into several key blocks: FIFO status output assignments, shift register handling for serial to parallel conversion, instantiation of a bit counter (`Audio_Bit_Counter`) to monitor valid audio inputs, and FIFO instantiations (`Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO`) for both left and right audio channels that handle writing and reading data in synchronization with the respective clocks. Parameters for audio data width and bit counter initialization are configurable to tailor the module's functionality for different audio processing requirements. The FIFOs store data temporarily and maintain buffer status to prevent data loss and ensure the appropriate timing of data retrieval from the buffers.
