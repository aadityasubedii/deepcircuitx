    "spec": "Module name: C_wave. \n\nModule specification: The C_wave module is designed to generate a 16-bit waveform output that progresses in a stepwise fashion thanks to a 12-bit step counter. Its operation is tied to the input clock signal, `dac_lrclk`, which increments the step counter on every positive edge. The sole input port, `dac_lrclk`, is critical for synchronization purposes and guides the wave generation in conjunction with an external digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The output signal, `wave`, is a 16-bit value stemming from an internal Look-Up Table submodule referred to as `C_LUT`. This submodule is integral to the waveform creation process, utilizing the current count of the `step_counter` to fetch and output the corresponding waveform data. Internally, the `step_counter` is the key signal that keeps a record of the steps, and by incrementing with each `dac_lrclk` clock pulse, it ensures that the waveform is constructed in a consistent and orderly manner. The `C_wave` module's code is divided into three main sections: the module declaration and port definitions, the combinational logic to increment the `step_counter`, and the instantiation of the `C_LUT` submodule that links the `step_counter` value to the `wave` output. In essence, the C_wave module acts as a waveform generator with precise control over the waveform's progression, useful in digital signal processing and similar applications where waveforms are digitally generated and then converted to analog signals.",
