    "module": "Module-level comment: The C_wave module generates a sequential waveform output synced with the `dac_lrclk` clock signal. It utilizes a 12-bit `step_counter` incremented at each clock's positive edge, which serves as an index to the `C_LUT` submodule that outputs the 16-bit `wave`. This systematic approach achieves a controlled waveform generation suitable for driving DACs in digital signal processing applications."
