    "spec": "Module name: Audio_Clock.\nModule specification: The Audio_Clock module is designed to generate a clock signal with a frequency division, outputted through the `c0` port. This is achieved by leveraging an 11-bit counter, `COUNTER_500`, which increments on every rising edge of the `clk` input signal. The module has a synchronous reset mechanism that is triggered on the rising edge of the `reset` input, resetting the counter to zero. Specifically, the input ports include `clk`, the primary clock signal that drives the counter, and `reset`, which is used to reset `COUNTER_500`. The output port, `c0`, is connected to the second bit of `COUNTER_500`, effectively producing a divided frequency clock signal relative to `clk`. Internally, the `COUNTER_500` register acts as the main component for frequency division. The Verilog code of the module consists of two primary blocks: an `assign` statement connecting `c0` to the second bit of the counter, and an `always` block handling the counter increment and synchronization to the input clock and reset logic, ensuring robust operation of the clock division functionality.",
