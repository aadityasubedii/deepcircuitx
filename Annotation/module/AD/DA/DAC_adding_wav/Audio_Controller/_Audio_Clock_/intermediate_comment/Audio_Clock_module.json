    "module": "Module-level comment: The Audio_Clock module generates a divided-frequency clock signal from the input `clk` using an 11-bit counter (`COUNTER_500`). By incrementing this counter on the `clk`'s rising edge and resetting it on `reset`'s rising edge, it outputs the counter's second bit through `c0`, thereby achieving frequency division. This simple yet effective design encapsulates frequency division and synchronization within a concise module."
