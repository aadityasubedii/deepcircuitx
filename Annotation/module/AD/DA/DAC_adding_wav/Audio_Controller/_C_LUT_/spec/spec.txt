Module name: C_LUT. Module specification: The C_LUT module implements a Look-Up Table (LUT) for wave generation. It takes a 12-bit input called step_counter, which serves as an index for the look-up table, and outputs a 16-bit value called wave, representing the amplitude of the wave at the given step. The module uses a single always block with a case statement to map each step_counter value (from 1 to 2064) to a corresponding wave amplitude. There are no internal signals used in this module, as it operates purely on combinational logic. The module consists of a single block containing the case statement, which directly maps the input to the output based on predefined values. For step_counter values outside the defined range (1-2064), the module outputs a default hexadecimal value of 0x7374. This LUT-based design allows for efficient generation of
