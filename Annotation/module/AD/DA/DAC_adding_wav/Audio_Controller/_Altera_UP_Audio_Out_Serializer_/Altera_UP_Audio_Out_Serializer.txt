Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer serializes 32-bit parallel audio data for both left and right channels. It uses two Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO instances for buffering and controlled by edge-detection signals for timing the serial output. The module ensures data integrity via FIFO status signals, adjusting output based on FIFOs' fullness and available write space.
