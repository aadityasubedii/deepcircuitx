It takes parallel audio data from the left and right audio channels, stores them into two separate FIFOs (First-In-First-Out memory queues), and outputs the audio data in a serial format.\n\nThe audio data width of the inputs is parameterizable, with a default of 32 bits for both left_channel_data and right_channel_data. The FIFOs are synchronized to the module's clock (clk) and have control signals for reset, data enable, and read enable. The module also generates and maintains signals to indicate the FIFOs' status, such as empty, full, and the amount of write space available.\n\nSerialization of the data happens based on edge triggers from bit_clk_rising_edge, bit_clk_falling_edge, left_right_clk_rising_edge, and left_right_clk_falling_edge. The data is read from the FIFOs alternately on the rising and falling edges of left_right_clk, and output serially using serial_audio_out_data based on the falling edge of bit_clk. When reset is asserted, the FIFO write space registers and the serial audio output data are reset.\n\nAdjustments to the serialization logic can be inferred from the edge-triggered control signals and the management of the data output shift register. The module operates with the help of external FIFO modules (Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO) which handle the data buffering for each audio channel. The parameter settings for the FIFOs, such as data width and depth, are specified through defparams at the end of the module definition."
