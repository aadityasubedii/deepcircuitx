Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer.

Module specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer is a Verilog module that serializes 32-bit parallel audio data inputs from left and right channels and outputs the data in a serial format. It utilizes an internal clock (clk) to synchronize its operations as well as a reset signal to initialize internal states. Various other input control signals, such as bit_clk_rising_edge, bit_clk_falling_edge, left_right_clk_rising_edge, and left_right_clk_falling_edge, signal edges of clocks specific to serialization and channel switching. The enable signals left_channel_data_en and right_channel_data_en control the writing of audio data to respective channel FIFOs. The module's outputs include left_channel_fifo_write_space and right_channel_fifo_write_space that indicate the remaining space in the FIFOs and the serial_audio_out_data that carries the serialized audio output.

Internally, the module uses flags like read_left_channel and read_right_channel that activate reading from FIFOs, FIFO status signals like left_channel_fifo_is_empty/full and right_channel_fifo_is_empty/full to indicate FIFO states, left_channel_fifo_used and right_channel_fifo_used to track data within FIFOs, and shift registers like data_out_shift_reg for holding the data being serialized.

The module encapsulates two blocks, Audio_Out_Left_Channel_FIFO and Audio_Out_Right_Channel_FIFO, which are instances of Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO managing the left and right audio data buffers respectively. These blocks control the writing of incoming parallel data to FIFOs, handle reading from FIFOs, and handle internal FIFO states like fullness or emptiness. The parameters for FIFOs such as width and depth are set using defparams, ensuring alignment with the expected audio data width.

Overall, the module is designed to interface with external DAC hardware, performing necessary data formatting for audio playback, while providing flow control mechanisms through FIFOs to manage the incoming stream of parallel audio data.
