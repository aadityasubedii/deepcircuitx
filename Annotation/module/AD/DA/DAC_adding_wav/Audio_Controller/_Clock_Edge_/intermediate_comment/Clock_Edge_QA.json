It operates by first capturing the current state of `test_clk` in a register `cur_test_clk` at every positive edge of `clk`. Another register, `last_test_clk`, stores the previous state of `cur_test_clk`, effectively lagging it by one `clk` cycle. The module then compares the current and the previous states of `test_clk` to determine if a rising or falling edge occurred. A rising edge is detected if the signal transitions from low to high (`cur_test_clk` is high and different from `last_test_clk`), while a falling edge is detected if the signal transitions from high to low (`last_test_clk` is high and different from `cur_test_clk`). The two outputs, `rising_edge` and `falling_edge`, indicate the detection of rising and falling edges, respectively."

Typically, it might be used to asynchronously reset the internal state of the module to a known state.\n- `test_clk`: This is the signal being monitored for edge detection.

It is derived by XOR-ing `last_test_clk` and `cur_test_clk`, which results in a high value (`1`) only when there is a difference between these two signals, i.e., an edge is detected.\n- `cur_test_clk`: This signal holds the current sampled state of the `test_clk` signal. It is updated at every positive edge of the global clock `clk`. Its role is to provide a real-time snapshot of the `test_clk` signal's state for comparison and edge detection.\n- `last_test_clk`: This register stores the state of `cur_test_clk` from the previous clock cycle.
