Module-level comment: The Clock_Edge module detects rising and falling edges of the `test_clk` signal based on the `clk` clock signal. It utilizes two registers, `cur_test_clk` and `last_test_clk`, to capture and compare the current and previous states of `test_clk`. Edge detection is executed through conditional logic that identifies transitions, emitting signals via `rising_edge` and `falling_edge` outputs when respective edges are detected.
