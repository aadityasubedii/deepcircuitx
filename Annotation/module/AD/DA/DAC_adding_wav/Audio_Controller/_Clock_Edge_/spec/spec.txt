Module name: Clock_Edge. Module specification: The Clock_Edge module is designed for detecting the rising and falling edges of a signal named `test_clk`, with these detections synchronized to another clock signal, `clk`. The input ports include `clk`, the primary clock input that governs the sampling of `test_clk`; `reset`, which is listed but unused in the current design and would typically serve to reset the module's state; and `test_clk`, the signal under observation for edge transitions. The output ports are `rising_edge` and `falling_edge`, signaling the detection of rising and falling edges, respectively. Internally, the module employs three signals: `found_edge` indicates the presence of any edge by comparing the current and previous states of `test_clk`; `cur_test_clk` captures the current state of `test_clk` at each positive edge of `clk`; and `last_test_clk` stores the state of `cur_test_clk` from the previous `clk` cycle, enabling the comparison that identifies edge transitions. The Verilog code defines the module structure with inputs and outputs specified, and includes blocks that update `cur_test_clk` and `last_test_clk` on each clock cycle, and assignments that determine edge events based on these states. The detailed interplay of these internal mechanisms enables the Clock_Edge module to fulfill its edge detection functionality efficiently.
