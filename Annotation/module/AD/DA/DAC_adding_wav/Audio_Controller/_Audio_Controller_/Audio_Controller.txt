Module-level comment: The Audio_Controller module interfaces with audio hardware, managing bidirectional audio data flow under a 50 MHz clock. It employs synchronization, buffer state management, and edge detection (Bit_Clock_Edges, ADC_DAC_Clock_Edges) for timing. The module incorporates data serializers/deserializers to handle audio signal serialization and deserialization, and internal FIFOs to manage the exchange of digital audio data. Its operation ensures synchronized, continuous audio data processing suited for real-time audio applications.
