Module name: Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO. Module specification: The Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO is a Verilog module designed for implementing a synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer leveraging Intel's scfifo component optimized for Cyclone IV E devices. The module's main functionality is to buffer data, facilitating seamless data transfer or temporary storage between processes operating at different rates. It includes input ports such as `clk` (clock signal for timing), `reset` (resets the FIFO), `write_en` (enables writing when high), `write_data` (data to be written into the FIFO), and `read_en` (enables reading when high). The output ports consist of `fifo_is_empty` (indicates FIFO is empty), `fifo_is_full` (indicates FIFO is full), `words_used` (displays the count of words in the FIFO), and `read_data` (outputs data read from FIFO). This module doesn't explicitly define internal signals; rather, it connects top-level ports directly to an instantiated scfifo component which abstracts underlying implementations. The code sections include parameter definitions (data width, depth, and address width customization), port declarations, and the scfifo component instantiation with specific configurations such as the FIFO depth and width, along with other optional settings tailored for the intended hardware target. This structure ensures a component that is configurable and optimized for specific data buffering needs in hardware applications.
