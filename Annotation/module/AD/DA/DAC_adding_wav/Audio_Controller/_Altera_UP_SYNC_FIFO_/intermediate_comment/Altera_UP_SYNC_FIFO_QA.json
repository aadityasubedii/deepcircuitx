The FIFO facilitates data buffering for applications requiring data transfer or temporary storage between processes operating at different rates or phases. It supports operations like data write (write_en and write_data inputs) and data read (read_en), with signals to indicate if the FIFO is empty (fifo_is_empty) or full (fifo_is_full), as well as showing the number of words currently stored in the FIFO (words_used). The data width (DATA_WIDTH) and FIFO depth (DATA_DEPTH) are parameterized, providing flexible FIFO dimensioning according to specific application needs."
