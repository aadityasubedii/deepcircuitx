    "spec": "Module name: C_wave. \n\nModule specification: \nThe C_wave module is designed to generate a waveform output based on an input clock signal and a look-up table (LUT). The module has a single input port, `dac_lrclk`, which is a clock signal triggering the waveform generation process. Upon every positive edge of this clock, the module increments an internal 12-bit register named `step_counter`. The `step_counter` acts as an indexer into a LUT named `C_LUT`, although the definition of `C_LUT` is external to this code snippet. The incremented value of `step_counter` is then used to access a corresponding value in the `C_LUT`. The output port `wave`, which is a 16-bit wide signal, transmits the accessed waveform data to external devices or system parts. This data output is directly determined by the contents of the `C_LUT` at the address specified by `step_counter`. Internally, the module consists of two primary blocks: the sequential logic block for the `step_counter` which increments at every positive edge of `dac_lrclk`, and the instantiation of the `C_LUT` which provides the wave output signal based on the current `step_counter` value. The behavior of the C_wave module allows for continuous waveform generation aligned with the frequency of the input clock signal.",
