It operates by stepping through values at a specific rate determined by the frequency input. The rate of stepping affects the output sine wave's frequency. The module achieves this by using a clock divider strategy in an always block, which increments a 'clock_divide' register until it meets a set threshold based on the input frequency selection. Once the threshold is met, it resets the 'clock_divide' and increments a 'step_counter', which is used to address a sine lookup table ('sine_LUT'). The output from 'sine_LUT', tied to the 'wave' output of the module, represents the amplitude values of the sine wave at different time instances."
