Module name: sine_stepper.

Module specification: The 'sine_stepper' module is responsible for generating a sine wave output with a frequency determined by an input selection. It utilizes a primary clock input, 'clock', to drive the sine wave generation process. The 'frequency' input is a 2-bit signal specifying one of four predetermined frequency settings for the sine wave output. The 'step' output is a 6-bit index to a sine lookup table (LUT), indicating the current position in the generated sine wave. The 'wave' output is a 16-bit signal representing the sine wave's amplitude at the current step, as determined by the LUT.

Internally, the module uses two signals: 'clock_divide', a 22-bit register acting as a counter to divide the clock frequency, and 'step_counter', a 6-bit register indexing the LUT. The 'always' block in the code updates these registers based on the 'frequency' input. The block reacts to positive clock edges and employs a case statement to handle the different frequency thresholds for updating 'clock_divide' and 'step_counter'. The module also declares parameter constants representing the supported frequency values. Additionally, there is an instantiation of the 'sine_LUT', mapping the 'step_counter' to the 'wave' output. If an unsupported frequency is encountered, the module defaults to resetting both counters.
