Module-level comment: The 'sine_stepper' module outputs a sine wave with selectable frequency. It steps through a sine LUT driven by an input clock, which is divided according to the frequency input. The clock_divide register counts clock cycles, and upon reaching the threshold defined by the frequency selection, increments the step_counter used as an index to the sine LUT, thus outputting the wave's amplitude.
