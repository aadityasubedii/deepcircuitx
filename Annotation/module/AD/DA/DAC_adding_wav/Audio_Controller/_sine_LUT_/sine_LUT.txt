Module-level comment: The `sine_LUT` module generates a 16-bit sine wave value based on a 6-bit `step_counter` serving as an index into a predefined sine wave lookup table. It uses an always block with a case statement to select the output from 64 fixed-point samples or a default value for out-of-range indices.
