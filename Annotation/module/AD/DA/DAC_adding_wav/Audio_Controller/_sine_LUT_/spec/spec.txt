Module name: sine_LUT. 
Module specification: The `sine_LUT` module is a hardware component using Verilog that specializes in generating sine wave values. The module utilizes a 6-bit input port named `step_counter` to index into a static lookup table that outputs a corresponding 16-bit sine wave value via the output port named `wave`. There are no internal signals defined within this module as it directly assigns output values within its combinational logic block. The core functionality of the module is encapsulated within an always block that reacts to changes in the `step_counter`. This block uses a case statement to select and map `step_counter` values to the pre-calculated fixed-point sine wave samples. In this table, 64 unique sample values of a sine wave are covered, one for each possible value of the `step_counter` from 0 to 63, with an additional default case providing a fallback value for any unspecified index. This module operates as a discrete sine wave generator that can be used in applications requiring wave value generation, such as digital signal processing.
