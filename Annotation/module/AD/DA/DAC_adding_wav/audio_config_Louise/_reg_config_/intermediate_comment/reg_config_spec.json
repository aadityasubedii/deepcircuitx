    "spec": "Module name: reg_config. Module specification: The reg_config module is designed for managing audio configurations within a system. It operates based on several inputs including a CLOCK signal for synchronous operations, an END signal to trigger configuration data loading, a RESET signal to initialize system states, a volume_key input for volume adjustments, and a sound_select input for selecting audio settings. Its outputs consist of a GO control signal indicating the readiness of data transmission and a 24-bit DATA signal carrying the audio configuration settings. Internally, the module employs an 11-bit COUNTER_500 to aid the GO signal operation, a ROM to store predefined configuration settings, a 16-bit DATA_A register to buffer data from the ROM, a 6-bit address pointer to navigate the ROM, a 5-bit vol register, and a 7-bit wire volume to manage audio levels, and a 3-bit sound_selector register to hold the selected sound setting upon reset. The code is organized into several blocks serving distinct functions: a combinational logic block for DATA and GO signal assignments, sequential logic blocks for manipulating the address, volume, and sound_selector states, a block to define parameters for audio configurations, and another for initializing the ROM content and updating the DATA_A register. Additionally, there is a clock-driven always block to increment the COUNTER_500 signal. These blocks work in concert to prepare the audio system's settings based on user inputs and internal states, readying the device for the execution of audio operations.",

It takes external inputs such as a clock signal, an END trigger, a RESET signal, a volume adjustment key, and a selection of sound settings. It outputs a signal 'GO' and a 24-bit 'DATA' which are generated based on internal conditions and operations such as counter advancements and ROM data handling. The module uses a ROM to store predefined configurations which are loaded upon certain triggers, primarily the END signal. Moreover, it manages volume adjustments and sound selection and sets different audio configuration parameters. The incremental counter, driven by the clock input, and address pointer for accessing ROM data are reset based on the RESET and END conditions."

It becomes active based on the value of COUNTER_500 and the condition of the address pointer relative to the ROM size.\n- DATA: A 24-bit output representing configuration data.

This data is subsequently used to construct the 24-bit DATA output.\n- address: A 6-bit pointer used to access the ROM.

It decreases with each positive edge of the volume_key signal.\n- volume: A 7-bit wire derived from the vol register adjusted by adding a constant value (96), likely representing a corrected volume level for output or further configuration.\n- sound_selector: A 3-bit register that captures the current sound setting selection from the sound_select input upon the posedge of RESET.
