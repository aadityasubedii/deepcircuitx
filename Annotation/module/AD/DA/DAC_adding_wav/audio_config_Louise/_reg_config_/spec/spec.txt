Module name: reg_config. Module specification: The reg_config module is designed for managing audio configurations within a system. It operates based on several inputs including a CLOCK signal for synchronous operations, an END signal to trigger configuration data loading, a RESET signal to initialize system states, a volume_key input for volume adjustments, and a sound_select input for selecting audio settings. Its outputs consist of a GO control signal indicating the readiness of data transmission and a 24-bit DATA signal carrying the audio configuration settings. Internally, the module employs an 11-bit COUNTER_500 to aid the GO signal operation, a ROM to store predefined configuration settings, a 16-bit DATA_A register to buffer data from the ROM, a 6-bit address pointer to navigate the ROM, a 5-bit vol register, and a 7-bit wire volume to manage audio levels, and a 3-bit sound_selector register to hold the selected sound setting upon reset. The code is organized into several blocks serving distinct functions: a combinational logic block for DATA and GO signal assignments, sequential logic blocks for manipulating the address, volume, and sound_selector states, a block to define parameters for audio configurations, and another for initializing the ROM content and updating the DATA_A register. Additionally, there is a clock-driven always block to increment the COUNTER_500 signal. These blocks work in concert to prepare the audio system's settings based on user inputs and internal states, readying the device for the execution of audio operations.
