Module name: audio_codec_config. 

Module specification: The `audio_codec_config` module is crafted to facilitate the configuration of an audio codec via I2C protocol, emphasizing volume and sound type adjustments based on its `volume_key` and `sound_select` inputs. Inputs to this module include `clock`, for timing internal operations and driving the I2C clock; `reset`, to initialize internal states; `volume_key`, to modify volume settings; and a 3-bit `sound_select` signal to choose audio output configurations. The module sports a single output, `I2C_SCLK`, the I2C clock signal essential for timing I2C communications, and an inout port, `I2C_SDAT`, serving the dual purpose of sending configuration data to and receiving data from the codec. Internally, this module utilizes a few signals: `COUNTER_500`, a register acting as a counter for deriving a slower clock (`CLOCK_500`) from the main `clock` input; `DATA`, a 24-bit wire carrying configuration data; and control signals `endI2C` and `goI2C` for managing the start and end of I2C transactions. The module is divided into distinct blocks, each with a specific function: a clock division mechanism driven by the `always` block that generates `CLOCK_500` from the main clock; the `reg_config` submodule that prepares the configuration data based on inputs; and the `i2c` submodule, named `adc_configure`, which handles the I2C communication with the audio codec. Notably, there's a discrepancy in the `reg_config` instantiation where it references a non-existent `CLOCK_50` instead of the intended 'CLOCK_500', suggesting an area for correction to ensure the module operates as intended.
