Module name: i2c. Module specification: The `i2c` module emulates an I2C master protocol controller specializing in data transfer processes. It interfaces with an I2C bus to either send or receive data to/from an I2C slave device. It drives the I2C serial clock (`I2C_SCLK`) and handles the data line (`I2C_SDAT`) using a 24-bit data vector (`I2C_DATA`) based on an external `CLOCK`. The module operation includes transmission control through a `GO` signal, and it provides indicators `END` and an acknowledgment signal `ACK` to show transfer completion and slave device acknowledgment respectively. The `RESET` is an input that initializes the controller, and `W_R` (which is not actively used in this code) is designed to select read or write mode. Internally, the module uses `SDO` to manage the data line output, `SCLK` for handling the clock inversion for proper clock phasing, a 24-bit register `SD` for temporary data storage, and `SD_COUNTER` for tracking the transaction progress. Acknowledgments from the slave are handled through `ACK1`, `ACK2`, and `ACK3` registering the response at predetermined states. The code is segmented into two main procedural blocks: one that controls the `SD_COUNTER` and the basic registers initialization on resets, and another that dictates the sequence of operations such as data loading, clock handling, and acknowledgment capture based on `SD_COUNTER` values, thereby managing the entire I2C data communication process ensuring sequential state transitions and data handling.
