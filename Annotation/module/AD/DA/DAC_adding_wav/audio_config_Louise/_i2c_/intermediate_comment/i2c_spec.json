    "spec": "Module name: i2c. Module specification: The `i2c` module emulates an I2C master protocol controller specializing in data transfer processes. It interfaces with an I2C bus to either send or receive data to/from an I2C slave device. It drives the I2C serial clock (`I2C_SCLK`) and handles the data line (`I2C_SDAT`) using a 24-bit data vector (`I2C_DATA`) based on an external `CLOCK`. The module operation includes transmission control through a `GO` signal, and it provides indicators `END` and an acknowledgment signal `ACK` to show transfer completion and slave device acknowledgment respectively. The `RESET` is an input that initializes the controller, and `W_R` (which is not actively used in this code) is designed to select read or write mode. Internally, the module uses `SDO` to manage the data line output, `SCLK` for handling the clock inversion for proper clock phasing, a 24-bit register `SD` for temporary data storage, and `SD_COUNTER` for tracking the transaction progress. Acknowledgments from the slave are handled through `ACK1`, `ACK2`, and `ACK3` registering the response at predetermined states. The code is segmented into two main procedural blocks: one that controls the `SD_COUNTER` and the basic registers initialization on resets, and another that dictates the sequence of operations such as data loading, clock handling, and acknowledgment capture based on `SD_COUNTER` values, thereby managing the entire I2C data communication process ensuring sequential state transitions and data handling.",

It uses input control signals and a 24-bit data vector to generate the correct I2C serial clock (`I2C_SCLK`) and data (`I2C_SDAT`) waveforms. The operation is clocked by an external `CLOCK` signal, and it can be started by asserting the `GO` signal. It has the capability to both write to and read from an I2C slave device as dictated by the `W_R` signal, although the code for handling different operations based on `W_R` is not provided. Upon completion of the transfer, an `END` signal is set high, and an acknowledgment signal `ACK` is composed of three parts (`ACK1`, `ACK2`, `ACK3`) that are tied to the acknowledgment from the slave device at different points in the transfer. A 6-bit `SD_COUNTER` is used to step through the various states of the I2C transfer. The `RESET` signal is used to reset the internal registers and counters of the module. The `SDO` signal is used to drive the `I2C_SDAT` line when data is being sent to the I2C bus."

                    "text": "Module name: i2c. Module specification: The `i2c` module emulates an I2C master protocol controller specializing in data transfer processes. It interfaces with an I2C bus to either send or receive data to/from an I2C slave device. It drives the I2C serial clock (`I2C_SCLK`) and handles the data line (`I2C_SDAT`) using a 24-bit data vector (`I2C_DATA`) based on an external `CLOCK`. The module operation includes transmission control through a `GO` signal, and it provides indicators `END` and an acknowledgment signal `ACK` to show transfer completion and slave device acknowledgment respectively. The `RESET` is an input that initializes the controller, and `W_R` (which is not actively used in this code) is designed to select read or write mode. Internally, the module uses `SDO` to manage the data line output, `SCLK` for handling the clock inversion for proper clock phasing, a 24-bit register `SD` for temporary data storage, and `SD_COUNTER` for tracking the transaction progress. Acknowledgments from the slave are handled through `ACK1`, `ACK2`, and `ACK3` registering the response at predetermined states. The code is segmented into two main procedural blocks: one that controls the `SD_COUNTER` and the basic registers initialization on resets, and another that dictates the sequence of operations such as data loading, clock handling, and acknowledgment capture based on `SD_COUNTER` values, thereby managing the entire I2C data communication process ensuring sequential state transitions and data handling."
