    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'i2c' module implements an I2C master protocol for data transfer excluding arbitration & addressing. It uses an external 'CLOCK' for timing, handling 'I2C_SCLK' generation and bidirectional 'I2C_SDAT'. Start ('GO'), reset ('RESET'), and end-of-transfer ('END') signals control operation flow, with a 'W_R' signal intended for direction control (unused in current implementation). Internal counters and state logic manage the serial data output ('SDO') and acknowledgments ('ACK1', 'ACK2', 'ACK3') after each byte transferred, all synchronized by edge-triggered processes on 'CLOCK' and 'RESET'."
