It uses input control signals and a 24-bit data vector to generate the correct I2C serial clock (`I2C_SCLK`) and data (`I2C_SDAT`) waveforms. The operation is clocked by an external `CLOCK` signal, and it can be started by asserting the `GO` signal. It has the capability to both write to and read from an I2C slave device as dictated by the `W_R` signal, although the code for handling different operations based on `W_R` is not provided. Upon completion of the transfer, an `END` signal is set high, and an acknowledgment signal `ACK` is composed of three parts (`ACK1`, `ACK2`, `ACK3`) that are tied to the acknowledgment from the slave device at different points in the transfer. A 6-bit `SD_COUNTER` is used to step through the various states of the I2C transfer. The `RESET` signal is used to reset the internal registers and counters of the module. The `SDO` signal is used to drive the `I2C_SDAT` line when data is being sent to the I2C bus."
