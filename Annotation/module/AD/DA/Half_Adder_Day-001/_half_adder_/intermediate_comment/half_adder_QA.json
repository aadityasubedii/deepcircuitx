The 'sum' output is the result of the bitwise XOR operation on the inputs, which gives the sum of the inputs without carry. The 'carry' output is the result of the bitwise AND operation on the inputs, indicating if there's a carry-out from the addition of the two input bits. This module essentially performs a half-addition, which is the simplest form of binary addition without considering any carry input from a previous stage."
