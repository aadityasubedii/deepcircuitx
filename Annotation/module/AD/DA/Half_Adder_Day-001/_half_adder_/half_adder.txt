Module-level comment: The `half_adder` module performs binary addition of single-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', outputting the 'sum' and 'carry'. Using continuous assignment statements, 'sum' is computed as the bitwise XOR of the inputs, and 'carry' as the bitwise AND, reflecting basic combinational logic without internal state or clock dependence.
