Module name: half_adder. Module specification: The `half_adder` module is a fundamental digital logic design that performs binary addition of two single-bit inputs without considering carry input from a previous stage. The module receives two inputs, 'a' and 'b', which are the bits to be added. Two outputs are generated by the module: 'sum' and 'carry'. The 'sum' output is produced through a bitwise XOR operation on the inputs, yielding the simple sum of 'a' and 'b'. The 'carry' output is the result of a bitwise AND operation on the inputs, indicating the presence of a carry-out that can be utilized in extended arithmetic operations. No internal signals are used in this module, indicating straightforward direct computation from inputs to outputs. The Verilog code consists mainly of the module's declaration, port declarations, continuous assignments for the 'sum' and 'carry' output, and the end of the module. These assignments act as combinational logic that calculates the respective outputs immediately based on the current values of 'a' and 'b', without the need for any clocking mechanism or internal storage.
