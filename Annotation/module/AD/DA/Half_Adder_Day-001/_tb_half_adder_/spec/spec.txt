Module name: tb_half_adder. Module specification: The `tb_half_adder` module functions as a testbench for verifying the operation of a half-adder design. It consists of two input ports, `a` and `b`, which are single-bit binary inputs designed to test different input conditions. The outputs are `sum` and `carry`, where `sum` represents the bitwise modulo-2 sum of `a` and `b` and `carry` indicates an overflow from the most significant bit if both inputs are high. Internally, `sum` and `carry` are declared as `wire` types, acting as connections to the half_adder instance outputs. The primary block within this module, "half_adder HA", instantiates the half_adder with inputs `a` and `b` and outputs `sum` and `carry`. The sequential `initial` block in the code is responsible for assigning test vectors to the inputs `a` and `b` at specified time intervals (every 5 time units), and signals the end of the simulation with `$stop` after the last test case. This setup ensures comprehensive testing of the half-adder circuit's response to all possible input combinations.
