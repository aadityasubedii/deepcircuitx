Module-level comment: The `tb_half_adder` serves as a testbench for a half-adder circuit, systematically stimulating its inputs (`a`, `b`) with all binary combinations and observing the outputs (`sum`, `carry`) to verify correct binary addition behavior. The module drives test vectors through the `half_adder` instance at 5ns intervals, concluding with a `$stop` command after the final input set, ensuring functionality is tested across its entire operational range.
