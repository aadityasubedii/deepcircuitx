If K is 0, it performs addition; if K is 1, it performs subtraction. This is achieved using 4 instances of a 1-bit full adder. B's bits are XORed with K to effectively toggle them for subtraction (adding the twos-complement) when K is 1. Each full adder takes a carry-in from the previous stage, starting from the input carry Cin, and provides a carry-out to the next stage, with the final carry-out stored in Cout. The results are stored in a 4-bit output S."

They serve as the modified B input to the full adders. In the case of addition (K=0), these signals are just the original bits of B. For subtraction (K=1), these bits are the bitwise complement of B, effectively preparing B's two's complement for the operation.\n- **c0, c1, c2:** These are the carry-out signals from the first three 1-bit full adders (F0, F1, F2) respectively. Each signal serves as the carry-in for the next significant full adder. c0 is the carry-out from the least significant full adder (F0) and acts as the carry-in for F1, c1 is the carry-out from F1 and acts as the carry-in for F2, and so on.
