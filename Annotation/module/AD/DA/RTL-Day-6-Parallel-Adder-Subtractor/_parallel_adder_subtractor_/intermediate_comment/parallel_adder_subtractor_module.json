    "module": "Module-level comment: The parallel_adder_subtractor module performs 4-bit addition or subtraction on inputs A and B, controlled by K (0 for addition, 1 for subtraction). Implementation uses XOR gates to conditionally toggle B's bits for subtraction and four 1-bit full adders (F0-F3) chained together, handling carry/borrow across the bits."
