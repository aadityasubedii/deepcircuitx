Module name: parallel_adder_subtractor.

Module specification: The parallel_adder_subtractor is designed to perform either addition or subtraction on two 4-bit inputs, A and B, controlled by a single bit K. When K is 0, the module adds A and B; when K is 1, it subtracts B from A. This functionality is supported through the use of XOR gates and four instances of a 1-bit full adder. The module has six ports: two 4-bit input ports, A and B, for the operands; a single-bit input K that selects between addition and subtraction; a single-bit input, Cin, which serves as the carry input for the operation; a 4-bit output port, S, which holds the result; and a single-bit output, Cout, which acts as the carry-out signal indicating an overflow in addition or underflow in subtraction. Internally, the module utilizes wires b0 through b3 for the XOR-ed versions of input B bits with K, effectively toggling B's bits for the subtraction operation when K is 1. It also includes wires c0 through c2 acting as carry-out signals from the first three 1-bit full adders and serving as carry inputs for the subsequent adder stages. The Verilog code is structured into clearly defined sections: the declaration of input and output ports, the instantiation of internal signals b0 to b3 by XOR-ing B's bits with K, and the chain of four 1-bit full adder instances (F0 to F3) that construct the adder/subtractor logic. Each full adder instance receives an operand bit from A and its corresponding modified bit from B (via b0 to b3), along with a carry-in signal, and it produces a result bit for S and a carry-out signal, ensuring seamless addition or subtraction across all four bits.
