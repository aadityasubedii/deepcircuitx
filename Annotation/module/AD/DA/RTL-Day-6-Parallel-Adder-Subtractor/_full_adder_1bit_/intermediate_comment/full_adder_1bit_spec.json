    "spec": "Module name: full_adder_1bit.\nModule specification: The full_adder_1bit module is designed to execute a single-bit full addition operation. It accepts three input ports: 'a', 'b', and 'cin'. 'a' and 'b' are single-bit inputs representing the binary numbers to be added, and 'cin' is the carry input from a preceding addition's less significant bit if the module is incorporated within a larger bit-wise adder circuit. The module produces two outputs: 'sum' and 'carry'. The 'sum' output gives the single-bit result of the addition, which is the bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of the input bits 'a', 'b', and 'cin'. The 'carry' output signifies the carry-out, which is calculated through a series of bitwise AND and OR operations on the inputs and can be used as the carry-in for a subsequent full_adder_1bit module in multi-bit addition scenarios. There are no internal signals in this module as it employs continuous assignment statements to compute the outputs directly from the inputs. The code comprises two primary blocks: the first block declares the input and output ports, and the second block contains the continuous assignments that define the logic operations for 'sum' and 'carry'. This module is straightforward and efficient, lacking any additional internal complexity.",
