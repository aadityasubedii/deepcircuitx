    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'full_adder_1bit' module performs a single-bit addition, taking two binary inputs, 'a' and 'b', and a carry-in 'cin'. It generates a 'sum' by XORing all inputs and a 'carry' through a combination of AND and OR operations across the inputs. This simple combinational design outputs the result of the bit-wise addition without internal state or intermediate signals."
