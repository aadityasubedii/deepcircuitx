Module-level comment: The 'parallel_adder_subtractor_tb' is a testbench for verifying a parallel adder-subtractor circuit. It conducts a series of tests by applying sequential test vectors for addition and subtraction operations to the DUT based on the control signal K. The testbench manages timed stimuli on input ports A, B, Cin, and toggles K between modes, while monitoring outputs S and Cout for correctness. Each test case is executed in 5-time unit intervals, concluding with a simulation termination command.
