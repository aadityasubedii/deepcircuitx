Module name: parallel_adder_subtractor_tb.

Module specification: The 'parallel_adder_subtractor_tb' module serves as a testbench designed to simulate and verify the functionality of a parallel adder-subtractor circuit. It inputs a set of test vectors to the Device Under Test (DUT), which is assumed to be the 'parallel_adder_subtractor' module. The primary functionality of this testbench module includes generating patterns to test the addition and subtraction capabilities of the DUT based on the control signal K. Input ports consist of A and B (4-bit each) which are the operands, K (1-bit) as the operation mode selector where '0' is for addition and '1' is for subtraction, and Cin (1-bit) which is a carry-in that also follows the mode set by K. Output ports are S (4-bit), the result of the arithmetic operation, and Cout (1-bit), which is the carry-out indicating an overflow or borrow out. This testbench does not introduce internal signals aside from defining the connection instance 'dut' for the 'parallel_adder_subtractor' module. It features an 'initial' block that sequentially applies test vector patterns to the DUT; setting mode for addition with equal operands, followed by setting mode for subtraction with one operand counting up from 0 and the other counting down from 15. The '#5' timing specifies that each test vector is held for 5 time units before proceeding to the next. Simulation is concluded with the '$finish' system task, which stops the simulation after the last test vector is applied.
