Module name: tb_RCA. Module specification: The module `tb_RCA` is a testbench designed to validate the functionality of a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), which is instantiated within the testbench as `RCA R`. The testbench uses internal signals and ports to facilitate this process; it declares two 4-bit registers `a` and `b` to hold input operands, and a single-bit register `cin` for the carry-in. There are also two 4-bit wires, `sum` and `carry`, which capture the resulting sum and carry-out from the RCA. The testbench runs through various addition scenarios by assigning values to `a`, `b`, and `cin` using a series of procedural assignments spaced 10 nanoseconds apart. Each scenario is intended to check the RCA’s response to different combinations of inputs and carry-in conditions, ensuring the RCA performs additions correctly. This provides a comprehensive assessment of the RCA’s operational correctness in different situations, making `tb_RCA` crucial for verifying the essential functionality of the RCA module.
