Module-level comment: The `tb_RCA` module serves as a testbench for validating a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) module. It instantiates the RCA and applies a sequence of input vectors (`a`, `b`, and `cin`) with a time delay of 10ns between each case to simulate various addition operations. The RCA's resulting sum and carry-out (`sum` and `carry`) are monitored by the testbench to ensure the module's correct functionality across different scenarios.
