Module name: ha.
Module specification: The 'ha' module is a Verilog implementation of a half-adder, a fundamental digital circuit used to add two single-bit binary numbers. It has two input ports: 'a' and 'b', which are the one-bit signals representing the binary digits to be added. There are also two output ports: 'sum' and 'carry'. The 'sum' output is generated by performing a bitwise XOR operation on the inputs, giving the addition result without carry, while 'carry' is the AND of the inputs, indicating if there's a carry out from the addition. This module does not utilize any internal signals, as all operations are directly computed based on the inputs. The code is organized into port declarations and continuous assignments, where 'sum' and 'carry' are immediately derived from inputs 'a' and 'b', reflecting a straightforward and efficient half-adder design.
