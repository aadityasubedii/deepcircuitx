Module name: RCA. Module specification: The RCA module is designed to perform addition on two 4-bit binary numbers using a ripple carry adder configuration, optimized for usage in computing sum operations where carry propagation between successive bits is essential. It takes two 4-bit vectors, `a` and `b`, along with a single-bit carry-in `cin`, delivering a 4-bit sum output and a carry for each bit in the 4-bit output vectors `sum` and `carry`, respectively. The module utilizes four instances of the `fa` (full adder) submodule, named F1, F2, F3, and F4, arranged in a cascading manner. Input `a` and `b` are directly mapped into these full adders, starting with `F1` that also takes the initial carry-in. The outputs from each full adder (`sum[bit]` and `carry[bit]`) are set as the corresponding bits in the output vectors `sum` and `carry`. Each submodule's carry-out feeds directly into the next full adder's carry-in, facilitating the ripple carry mechanismâ€”a fundamental mechanism of the RCA module to propagate carries across all bits from the least to the most significant. The RCA module, due to its simplicity, does not declare other internal signals, focusing solely on the instantiation and chaining of full adders to achieve the desired binary addition functionality.
