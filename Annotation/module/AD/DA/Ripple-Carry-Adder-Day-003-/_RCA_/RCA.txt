Module-level comment: The RCA module performs 4-bit binary addition using a ripple carry adder. It sequentially chains four 'fa' full adder submodules (F1 to F4) where each full adder computes a bit of the sum and propagates the carry. The first full adder starts with an external carry-in, and each subsequent adder takes the carry-out from the previous adder, resulting in a 4-bit sum output and a per-bit carry output. This structure allows effective carry propagation from the least significant to the most significant bit.
