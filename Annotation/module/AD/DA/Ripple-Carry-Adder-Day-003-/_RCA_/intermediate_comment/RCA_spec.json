    "spec": "Module name: RCA. Module specification: The RCA module is designed to perform addition on two 4-bit binary numbers using a ripple carry adder configuration, optimized for usage in computing sum operations where carry propagation between successive bits is essential. It takes two 4-bit vectors, `a` and `b`, along with a single-bit carry-in `cin`, delivering a 4-bit sum output and a carry for each bit in the 4-bit output vectors `sum` and `carry`, respectively. The module utilizes four instances of the `fa` (full adder) submodule, named F1, F2, F3, and F4, arranged in a cascading manner. Input `a` and `b` are directly mapped into these full adders, starting with `F1` that also takes the initial carry-in. The outputs from each full adder (`sum[bit]` and `carry[bit]`) are set as the corresponding bits in the output vectors `sum` and `carry`. Each submodule's carry-out feeds directly into the next full adder's carry-in, facilitating the ripple carry mechanism\u2014a fundamental mechanism of the RCA module to propagate carries across all bits from the least to the most significant. The RCA module, due to its simplicity, does not declare other internal signals, focusing solely on the instantiation and chaining of full adders to achieve the desired binary addition functionality.",

It takes two 4-bit inputs `a` and `b`, along with a carry-in input `cin`. The module produces a 4-bit sum output and a carry output for each bit. This addition is carried out using four instances (`F1`, `F2`, `F3`, `F4`) of the `fa` (full adder) sub-module, which are cascaded such that the carry-out of one full adder is fed as the carry-in to the next full adder in the series, effectively creating a chain (ripple) of carries from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. The first full adder also considers an initial carry-in. The result is a 4-bit sum of the two inputs plus the initial carry-in, with an additional carry-out represented by the carry array."

The `cin` port is a single bit that acts as the carry-in for the least significant bit addition.

The `carry` port is also a 4-bit vector, which contains the carry-out of each of the full adders used internally in the module.
