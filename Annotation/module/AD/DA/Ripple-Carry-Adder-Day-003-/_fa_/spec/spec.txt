Module name: fa. Module specification: The "fa" module encapsulates a full adder circuit design realized in Verilog, targeted at binary addition of two 1-bit inputs alongside a carry-in value to produce a resultant sum and a carry-out. Specifically, the module defines three input ports: 'a' and 'b', which accept the two 1-bit binary values for addition, and 'cin', which represents the carry-in bit from a previous addition stage. The outcomes of the module are twofold, encompassed by two output ports: 'sum', a 1-bit value resulting from the addition of 'a', 'b', and 'cin'; and 'carry', a 1-bit value that signifies a carry-out generated when the sum exceeds the capacity of a single bit. Internal to the module are three wire signalsâ€”'w1', 'w2', and 'w3'. 'w1' acts as an intermediary sum of 'a' and 'b' supplied by the first half adder ('H1'), while 'w2' captures the carry generated by the same operation. The second half adder ('H2') utilizes 'w1' and 'cin' for computing the final sum and produces 'w3', an intermediate carry. These components organize the logic of the full adder: 'H1' performs the initial addition of 'a' and 'b', 'H2' adds the result of 'H1' to 'cin', and an OR gate combines 'w2' and 'w3' to finalize the 'carry' output. This structure facilitates the primary function of the full adder, enabling bit-wise addition with carry handling, essential for constructing more complex arithmetic units.
