    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"fa\" module implements a full adder circuit for binary addition of two 1-bit inputs ('a', 'b') and a carry-in ('cin'), yielding a sum ('sum') and a carry-out ('carry'). Utilizing two half adders ('H1' and 'H2') for preliminary sum and carry calculations, and an OR gate to determine the final carry, the module efficiently encapsulates the essential logic for bit-wise addition with carry handling."
