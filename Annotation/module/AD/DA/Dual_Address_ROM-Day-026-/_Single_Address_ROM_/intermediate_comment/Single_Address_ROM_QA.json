It uses a clock signal (clk) and an enable signal (en) to control the reading of data. Based on a 3-bit address input (addr), it outputs a 16-bit data value (data_out). The ROM stores predefined 16-bit values assigned to addresses ranging from 0 to 7 (represented in binary from 4'b000 to 4'b111). If the enable signal is high, the data corresponding to the address is outputted; if the enable signal is low, the output is set to high impedance ('z). The ROM handles address cases using a combinational case statement inside a clocked block, ensuring data is latched out only on the rising edge of the clock and when enabled."
