    "module": "Module-level comment: The Single_Address_ROM module implements a read-only memory storing 8 predefined 16-bit values, accessed via a 3-bit address. It operates with a synchronous read on the positive edge of the clock and requires an enable signal for data output. Internally, it uses a case statement to map addresses to stored values, outputting them or 'Z' on disable."
