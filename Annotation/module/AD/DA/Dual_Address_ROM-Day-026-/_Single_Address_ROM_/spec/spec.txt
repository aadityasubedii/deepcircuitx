Module name: Single_Address_ROM. 

Module specification: The Single_Address_ROM is a read-only memory (ROM) module designed for accessing pre-defined 16-bit data based on a 3-bit address input. It operates synchronously with a clock signal (clk) and employs an enable signal (en) to control the data output. The input ports include 'clk', which is the clock signal dictating the timing of data reads; 'en', an enable signal that allows data output only when it's high; and 'addr', a 3-bit input determining which data is read from the ROM. The sole output port, 'data_out', outputs the 16-bit data corresponding to the provided address or goes into a high impedance state (Z) when 'en' is low. Internally, the module utilizes eight 16-bit wires labeled L0 through L7, each assigned a unique hexadecimal value representing the data stored at addresses 0 to 7. The Verilog code features a combinational case statement encapsulated within an 'always' block triggered on the rising edge of 'clk'. This block checks the 'en' signal, and if high, it selects one of the internal signals based on 'addr' to assign to 'data_out' or sets 'data_out' to a high impedance state if 'en' is low, ensuring proper data output control.
