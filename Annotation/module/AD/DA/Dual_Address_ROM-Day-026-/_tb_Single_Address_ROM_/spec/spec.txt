Module name: TB_Single_Address_ROM.
Module specification: The TB_Single_Address_ROM module serves as a testbench designed to verify the functionality of a Single Address ROM by simulating a clock and enable signals to sequentially iterate through memory addresses from 0 to 7, fetching data for each address. It includes three input ports: 'clk' (a clock signal that synchronizes ROM operations, toggling every 5ns), 'en' (an enable signal that activates ROM data output, set high after a 3ns delay from the simulation start), and 'addr' (a 4-bit address input selecting ROM data locations). The module also features one output port, 'data_out', a 16-bit wire that delivers the data from the addressed ROM location. Internally, the module utilizes several signals: â€˜clk' (regulated every 5ns to emulate a working clock), 'en' (controlled to validate data outputs), 'addr' (sequentially set to addresses 0 through 7 with a 10ns delay between each), 'data_out' (transmits output data), and 'i' (an iterative control in a loop used for cycling through addresses). In the implementation, the module contains three primary blocks: initial block setting the initial conditions and enabling the ROM, an always block for clock toggling, and another initial block managing the address iteration and concluding the simulation.
