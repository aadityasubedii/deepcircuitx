It includes three input ports: 'clk' (a clock signal that synchronizes ROM operations, toggling every 5ns), 'en' (an enable signal that activates ROM data output, set high after a 3ns delay from the simulation start), and 'addr' (a 4-bit address input selecting ROM data locations). The module also features one output port, 'data_out', a 16-bit wire that delivers the data from the addressed ROM location. Internally, the module utilizes several signals: \u2018clk' (regulated every 5ns to emulate a working clock), 'en' (controlled to validate data outputs), 'addr' (sequentially set to addresses 0 through 7 with a 10ns delay between each), 'data_out' (transmits output data), and 'i' (an iterative control in a loop used for cycling through addresses). In the implementation, the module contains three primary blocks: initial block setting the initial conditions and enabling the ROM, an always block for clock toggling, and another initial block managing the address iteration and concluding the simulation.",

It is used to select which memory location data should be read from in the ROM. During the simulation's operation, it is sequenced through values 0 to 7 in a loop, with a delay of 10ns before updating to a new address.\n- **data_out**: This is the output data line, declared as a 16-bit wire (`wire [15:0] data_out`).
