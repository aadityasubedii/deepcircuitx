    "module": "Module-level comment: The TB_Single_Address_ROM is a testbench that validates a Single Address ROM by simulating a clock and enable signals, and iterating through memory addresses 0-7 to retrieve data. It toggles the clock every 5ns, sets enable after a 3ns delay, and outputs data through the 'data_out' port as it cycles through addresses using a for-loop with a 10ns delay between increments, ending the simulation after the final address check."
