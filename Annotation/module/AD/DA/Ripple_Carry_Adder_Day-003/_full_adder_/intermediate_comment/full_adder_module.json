    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'full_adder' module implements a combinational circuit for adding three binary bits: two significant bits 'a' and 'b', and a carry-in 'cin'. It outputs the sum (a XOR b XOR cin) and carry-out ((a & b) | (b & cin) | (cin & a)), directly computed from inputs without intermediate signals, facilitating basic binary addition operations."
