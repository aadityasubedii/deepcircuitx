Module name: full_adder.  
Module specification: The 'full_adder' module is a fundamental combinational circuit that performs the addition of three binary bits: two significant bits and one carry-in bit. Specifically, this module receives two input bits 'a' and 'b', which are the primary digits to add, and an input 'cin', which is the carry-in bit from a previous addition, relevant in multibit adders. The module produces two outputs - 'sum' and 'carry'. The 'sum' output is computed as the XOR of the inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin', delivering the least significant result bit of the addition. The 'carry' output is calculated as the OR of all two-bit combinations that can generate a carry (i.e., 'a & b', 'b & cin', and 'cin & a'), serving as the carry-out that possibly feeds into the next higher bit addition in larger arithmetic operations. Internally, there are no separate signals defined; all calculations are directly assigned to the outputs without intermediate storage. The code consists of two primary assign statements that define the logic for the outputs directly from the inputs without utilizing any additional internal logic or registers, emphasizing simplicity and direct computation in this basic arithmetic operation.
