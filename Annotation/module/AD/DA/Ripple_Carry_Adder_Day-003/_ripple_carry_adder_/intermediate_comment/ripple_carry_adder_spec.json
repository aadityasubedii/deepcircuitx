    "spec": "Module name: ripple_carry_adder. Module specification: The `ripple_carry_adder` module is designed to perform 4-bit addition, taking into account a carry input, thereby enabling its use in larger arithmetic operations through cascading. It operates by accepting two 4-bit input vectors, `a` and `b`, representing the operands to be added, and a 4-bit vector `cin` that serves as the carry input for each bit position. The result of this addition is presented through a 4-bit vector `sum` which represents the sum of `a` and `b` including the initial carry input from `cin`. Additionally, a 4-bit vector `carry` is output, representing the carry resulting from the addition of each bit; this is crucial for chaining this module in larger arithmetic systems where the carry-out from one stage needs to be input to the next. Internally, this module does not define or use any user-defined signals; instead, it directly connects the inputs and outputs to four instances of a `full_adder` module (FA1, FA2, FA3, FA4), each responsible for adding the respective bits of `a`, `b`, and `cin` to produce the corresponding bits in `sum` and `carry`. This structure efficiently demonstrates the principle of a ripple carry adder, where the carry output from one full adder instance is fed as the carry input to the subsequent instance, though this chaining is implied through the external connections of the `carry` outputs to subsequent `cin` inputs in larger configurations.",
