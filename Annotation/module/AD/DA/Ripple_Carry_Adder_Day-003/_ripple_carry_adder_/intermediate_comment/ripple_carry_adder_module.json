    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'ripple_carry_adder' is a 4-bit adder that sums two 4-bit operands 'a' and 'b', along with a carry input 'cin', outputting a 4-bit 'sum' and 'carry'. It achieves this by instantiating four 'full_adder' modules, each computing the sum and carry of individual bits sequentially, exemplifying the ripple carry addition method where carry-out of one bit is the carry-in for the next."
