Module-level comment: The 'tb_ripple_carry_adder' is a testbench for verifying a 4-bit ripple carry adder. It initializes the adder inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin' with predefined values, simulates timing with delays, and monitors the 'sum' and 'carry' outputs to validate correct addition. It sequentially tests various input combinations, assessing the adder performance. The module stops the simulation after executing all test cases.
