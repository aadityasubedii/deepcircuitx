Module-level comment: The 'adaptfileightinput' module distributes a signed 8-bit input 'xin' to four outputs (x0, x1, x2, x3) based on a counter that advances with each clock pulse ('clk'). Resets via 'rst' restart the counter. A `case` statement assigns 'xin' to outputs in a cycling sequence, enabling sequential data distribution across multiple cycles.
