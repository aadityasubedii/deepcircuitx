    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'adaptfil8' module implements an adaptive digital filter in Verilog, processing an 8-bit signed input signal (`x_in`) against a 10-bit reference (`d_in`) to dynamically adjust its filter coefficients and minimize error. It utilizes lookup tables (LUTs), shift registers, and arithmetic operations synchronized by a clock (`clk`) and reset (`rst`). Outputs are a filtered signal (`fil_out`) and an error signal (`err`), reflecting the deviation from the desired output. Advanced control mechanisms and signal manipulation ensure real-time adaptation suitable for applications like noise reduction."
