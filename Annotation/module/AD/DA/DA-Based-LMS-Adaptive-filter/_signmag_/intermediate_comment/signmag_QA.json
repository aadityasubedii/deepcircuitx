It takes an 8-bit signed input (`inp`), and produces two outputs: `sign` and `mag`. The `sign` is a single bit indicating the sign of the input (0 for positive and 1 for negative), extracted directly from the most significant bit of the input. The `mag` output represents the magnitude of the input in a 7-bit signed format. If the input is positive, `mag` is the same as the input's least significant 7 bits. If the input is negative, `mag` is calculated as the negative of the input's least significant 7 bits."

It consists of a sign bit (the most significant bit) and 7 bits representing the magnitude in two\u2019s complement format for signed numbers.\n\nOutput ports: `sign`, `mag`.  \nExplanation: The `sign` output is a single bit that reflects the sign of the input number, with 0 indicating a positive number and 1 indicating a negative number. This bit is taken directly from the most significant bit of the `inp` input. The `mag` output is a 7-bit signed value that represents the magnitude of the input number in its sign and magnitude form. For positive numbers, `mag` directly matches the least significant 7 bits of `inp`. For negative numbers, `mag` is calculated as the negative (-) of `inp`\u2019s least significant 7 bits, essentially performing a two's complement operation within the module logic to represent magnitude."

It indicates the sign of the input value, where 0 represents a positive number and 1 represents a negative number. In the logic of the module, it is then used in conditional statements to decide whether the `mag` (magnitude) output should simply reflect the least significant 7 bits of the input or if it should be the negative of those 7 bits, in the case where the input number is negative. This conditional logic is essential for converting the input from a signed format to a sign and magnitude representation. \n\nNo other internal (hidden or helper) signals are defined or used within the module as it is presented.
