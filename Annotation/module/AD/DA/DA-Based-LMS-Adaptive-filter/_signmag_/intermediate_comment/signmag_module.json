    "module": "Module-level comment: The `signmag` module converts an 8-bit signed integer (`inp`) from two's complement to a sign and magnitude representation. It directly assigns the sign from `inp`'s MSB to the `sign` output and conditionally sets the 7-bit `mag` output to the absolute value of `inp`, using two's complement for negative numbers. This is handled by simple conditional logic within an always block, ensuring adaptability to input changes."
