Module-level comment: The 'da8' module implements a digital FIR filter using distributed arithmetic, avoiding direct multiplications. It filters four signed 8-bit inputs with 8-bit coefficients, outputting a 10-bit result. Internally, it uses LUTs addressed by weight bits for partial sums, accumulating and averaging results synchronized to the clock, with reset capability.
