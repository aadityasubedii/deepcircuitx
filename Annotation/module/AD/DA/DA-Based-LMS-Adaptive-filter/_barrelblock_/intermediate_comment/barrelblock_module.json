    "module": "Module-level comment: The barrelblock module shifts four 8-bit signed inputs via barrel shifters, latches values with DFFs, and conditionally adds or subtracts the shifted and latched values based on a sign bit. Utilizes an always block for arithmetic operations and outputs the results in 8-bit registers, controlled by a clock and reset."
