Module name: dff8. Module specification: The 'dff8' module is an 8-bit digital flip-flop that operates as a memory element in digital circuits. It features a signed 8-bit data input port 'Din', a clock signal 'clk', and a reset signal 'rst'. The module also has an 8-bit signed output port 'Q'. On each positive edge of the clock signal 'clk', the output 'Q' is updated. If the reset signal 'rst' is active (high), the output 'Q' is cleared to zero, otherwise, it follows the input 'Din', thus storing its value. There are no internal signals used in this module apart from inputs and the output. The core functionality is encapsulated in an 'always' block that triggers on the rising edge of 'clk', which checks the state of 'rst' to decide whether to reset the output or update it to 'Din'. This design effectively enables the module to store or reset data based on the clock and reset input, demonstrating a fundamental memory element behavior in digital circuit design.
