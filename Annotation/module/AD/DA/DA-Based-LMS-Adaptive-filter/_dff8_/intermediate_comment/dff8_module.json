    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'dff8' module implements an 8-bit digital flip-flop, serving as a basic memory element. It captures the value of a signed 8-bit input 'Din' on the rising edge of 'clk', unless 'rst' is high, which clears the output 'Q' to zero. This functionality is realized within an 'always' block, ensuring that 'Q' either stores 'Din' or resets based on 'clk' and 'rst' signals, without using any internal signals."
