It accepts a signed 8-bit data input (Din), a clock signal (clk), and a reset signal (rst). On the rising edge of the clock signal, if the reset signal is active (high), the flip-flop's output (Q) is set to 0. Otherwise, the output will follow the input value (Din), effectively storing it until the next clock cycle or reset."

The clk is an input port that receives the clock signal, which triggers state changes in the flip-flop on its positive edge. The rst is an input port that receives the reset signal to asynchronously clear the flip-flop output to zero when activated (high).\n\nOutput ports: Q.\nExplanation: Q is an 8-bit signed output port of the flip-flop. It holds the value of the data input Din when the reset signal is not active and the clock signal has a positive edge transition. If the reset signal is active, Q is set to zero, regardless of the Din value."

The only inputs are `Din`, `clk`, and `rst`, and the only output is the register `Q`. The role of `Q` is to store the value of `Din` or reset to zero depending on the state of `rst` and the edge of `clk`, but it is directly an output port rather than an internal signal. Thus, the module does not use any additional internal signals for its operation."
