It features a signed 8-bit data input port 'Din', a clock signal 'clk', and a reset signal 'rst'. The module also has an 8-bit signed output port 'Q'. On each positive edge of the clock signal 'clk', the output 'Q' is updated. If the reset signal 'rst' is active (high), the output 'Q' is cleared to zero, otherwise, it follows the input 'Din', thus storing its value. There are no internal signals used in this module apart from inputs and the output. The core functionality is encapsulated in an 'always' block that triggers on the rising edge of 'clk', which checks the state of 'rst' to decide whether to reset the output or update it to 'Din'. This design effectively enables the module to store or reset data based on the clock and reset input, demonstrating a fundamental memory element behavior in digital circuit design.",

The clk is an input port that receives the clock signal, which triggers state changes in the flip-flop on its positive edge. The rst is an input port that receives the reset signal to asynchronously clear the flip-flop output to zero when activated (high).\n\nOutput ports: Q.\nExplanation: Q is an 8-bit signed output port of the flip-flop.
