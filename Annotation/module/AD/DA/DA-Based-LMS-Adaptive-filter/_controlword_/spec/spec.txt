Module name: controlword. Module specification: The 'controlword' module is designed to determine the position of the first '1' bit in a 7-bit input 'mag', and encode this position into a 3-bit output 't'. The input port 'mag' is a 7-bit wide signal used for inputting the magnitude value, and each bit is inspected sequentially from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. The output port 't' is a 3-bit wide signal that outputs a specific code corresponding to the position of the first '1' encountered in 'mag'. If no '1' is found within 'mag', 't' outputs '111', representing an all-zero condition in 'mag'. There are no internal signals used in this module; it directly utilizes the input 'mag' and output 't' within the procedural block. The Verilog code mainly consists of an always block that executes combinational logic. This block employs a series of if-else statements to check each bit of 'mag' in descending order of significance and assigns the encoded value to 't' based on which bit is set to '1' first. If none of the bits is '1', 't' is set to '111'. This straightforward and hierarchical approach ensures clarity in design and functionality, facilitating both understanding and modifications if needed.
