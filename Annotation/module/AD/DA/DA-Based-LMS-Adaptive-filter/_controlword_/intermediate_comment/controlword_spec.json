    "spec": "Module name: controlword. Module specification: The 'controlword' module is designed to determine the position of the first '1' bit in a 7-bit input 'mag', and encode this position into a 3-bit output 't'. The input port 'mag' is a 7-bit wide signal used for inputting the magnitude value, and each bit is inspected sequentially from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. The output port 't' is a 3-bit wide signal that outputs a specific code corresponding to the position of the first '1' encountered in 'mag'. If no '1' is found within 'mag', 't' outputs '111', representing an all-zero condition in 'mag'. There are no internal signals used in this module; it directly utilizes the input 'mag' and output 't' within the procedural block. The Verilog code mainly consists of an always block that executes combinational logic. This block employs a series of if-else statements to check each bit of 'mag' in descending order of significance and assigns the encoded value to 't' based on which bit is set to '1' first. If none of the bits is '1', 't' is set to '111'. This straightforward and hierarchical approach ensures clarity in design and functionality, facilitating both understanding and modifications if needed.",

The functionality is determined by examining each bit of the input 'mag' starting from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). It checks each bit in sequence from MSB (mag[6]) to LSB (mag[0]) to find the first bit that is set to 1. Based on which bit is the first encountered as '1', the module assigns a specific 3-bit pattern to the output 't'. If the MSB (mag[6]) is '1', the output is set to '000'. If it's not, but the next bit (mag[5]) is '1', then the output is '001', and so on, following a specific pattern for each bit down to mag[0]. If none of the bits in 'mag' are '1', the output 't' is set to '111'. This functionality essentially encodes the position of the first '1' bit encountered in the input 'mag' into a specific 3-bit code in the output 't'."
