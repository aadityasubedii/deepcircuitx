    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'controlword' module identifies the position of the first '1' in a 7-bit input 'mag' and encodes this position into a 3-bit output 't'. It achieves this through a series of if-else conditions in an always block, checking each bit from the most significant to the least significant. The output 't' is set based on the first '1' encountered, with '111' indicating no '1' found in 'mag'. This implementation ensures efficient bit encoding using straightforward combinational logic."
