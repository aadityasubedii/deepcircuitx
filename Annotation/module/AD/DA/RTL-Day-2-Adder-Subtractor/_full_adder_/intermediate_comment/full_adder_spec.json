    "spec": "Module name: full_adder. \nModule specification: The 'full_adder' module is designed to perform the addition of three binary bits: 'a', 'b', and 'cin' (carry-in), providing a sum ('s') and a carry-out ('co') as outputs. The input ports 'a' and 'b' are the primary binary digits to be added, while 'cin' serves as the carry input from a previous addition. Output port 's' provides the bitwise XOR result of 'a', 'b', and 'cin', representing the sum, and 'co' indicates the carry-out, essential for chaining in multi-bit adder configurations. Internally, the module utilizes three wire signals: 'w1', 'w2', and 'w3'. 'w1' results from 'a' AND 'b', 'w2' from 'b' AND 'cin', and 'w3' from 'a' AND 'cin'. These are used to determine the carry-out by an OR operation combining 'w1', 'w2', and 'w3', thus producing the carry-out 'co'. The module effectively uses basic logical gates organized in blocks to compute these operations, ensuring the accurate arithmetic addition of the three input bits while adhering to binary addition rules.",
