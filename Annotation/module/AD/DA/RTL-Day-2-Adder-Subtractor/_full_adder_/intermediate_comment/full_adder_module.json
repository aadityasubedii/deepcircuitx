    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'full_adder' module performs the addition of three binary inputs ('a', 'b', 'cin') to produce a sum ('s') and carry-out ('co'). It implements this with XOR for the sum, and a combination of ANDs for intermediate signals ('w1', 'w2', 'w3'), followed by an OR to determine the carry-out, embodying the core logic of binary addition."
