    "spec": "Module name: full_adder_tb. \nModule specification: The 'full_adder_tb' is a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of the 'full_adder' circuit, referred to as 'dut' within the code. It simulates input scenarios for testing all possible combinations of two one-bit numbers and a carry-in bit to ascertain the operational correctness of the full adder. The input ports include 'a', 'b', and 'cin', which mimic the binary numbers and carry-in for addition, while the outputs, 's' (sum) and 'co' (carry-out), help verify the results against expected outcomes. Internal signals such as register types 'a', 'b', 'cin' and wire types 's', 'co' are crucial for this task, where registers hold and manipulate input test vectors, and wires relay output from the device under test. The testbench defines an initial block that systematically applies various combinations to the inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin' and uses non-blocking assignments to drive changes with intentional delays ('#10'), ensuring the 'full_adder' logic has sufficient time to process inputs and produce outputs. The sequence concludes with a '$finish' command to terminate the simulation after all test cases have been executed.",
