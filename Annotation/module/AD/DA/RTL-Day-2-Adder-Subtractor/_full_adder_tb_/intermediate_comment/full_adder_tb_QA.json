In the testbench, these signals are driven by the testbench itself to simulate various addition scenarios.\n\n- `s`, `co`: These two signals are the outputs from the full adder circuit under test. `s` stands for the sum bit, which is the direct result of adding the inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin`. `co` stands for the carry-out bit, indicating whether there is an overflow out of the most significant bit that would, in a more comprehensive circuit, be chained as a carry-in bit (`cin`) to the next significant position's addition. \n\nEach of these signals plays a critical role in verifying the correct operation of the full adder circuit by allowing the testbench to exercise all possible combinations of input values and observe the resulting outputs."
