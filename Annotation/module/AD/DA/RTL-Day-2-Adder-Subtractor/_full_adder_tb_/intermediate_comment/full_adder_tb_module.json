    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'full_adder_tb' serves as a testbench for validating the 'full_adder' circuit ('dut'). It simulates input combinations for 'a', 'b', and 'cin' and checks the outputs 's' and 'co' to ensure correct adder functionality. Test vectors are applied using non-blocking delays to inputs through internal registers, while output wires monitor the result of each test case scenario. The process is automated within an initial block, and test execution is finalized with '$finish'."
