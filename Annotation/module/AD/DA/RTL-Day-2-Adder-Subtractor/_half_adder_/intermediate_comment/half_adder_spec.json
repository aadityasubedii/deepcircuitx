    "spec": "Module name: half_adder. Module specification: The 'half_adder' module is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations on two single-bit binary inputs, specifically yielding a sum and a carry value. It incorporates two input ports: 'a' and 'b', where each port accepts a single-bit binary value representing the operands to be added. The module outputs two single-bit binary values through its output ports 's' (sum) and 'c' (carry). The sum ('s') is calculated by executing an XOR operation on the inputs 'a' and 'b', effectively determining the bitwise sum without carry. Conversely, the carry ('c') is derived from performing an AND operation on the same inputs, indicating if both inputs are high (1), which is critical for multi-bit addition in larger arithmetic circuits where cascading of half adders or extension to full adders may be necessary. Internally, the module does not employ any signals apart from the inputs and outputs, thereby directly connecting the operational logic (XOR for the sum and AND for the carry) to the respective output ports. This straightforward design underscores the module's efficiency and simplicity, making it an elemental building block in digital electronics for constructing more complex arithmetic operations.",
