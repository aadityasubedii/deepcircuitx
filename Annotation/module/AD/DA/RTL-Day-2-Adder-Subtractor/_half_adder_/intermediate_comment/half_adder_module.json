    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'half_adder' module performs basic binary addition on two inputs 'a' and 'b'. It outputs the sum 's' using an XOR operation and the carry 'c' using an AND operation. This module directly links logical operations to outputs without internal signaling, optimizing elemental arithmetic circuit design."
