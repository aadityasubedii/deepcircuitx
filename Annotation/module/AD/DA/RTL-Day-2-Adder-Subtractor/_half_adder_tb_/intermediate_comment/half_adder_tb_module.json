    "module": "Module-level comment: The `half_adder_tb` is a testbench for the half adder circuit, testing all possible binary combinations on inputs `a` and `b`. It deploys reg types for inputs and wire types for capturing outputs, cycling through input scenarios with a 10-unit delay between each, before concluding with `$finish`. This ensures comprehensive validation of the half adder\u2019s sum (`s`) and carry (`c`) operations."
