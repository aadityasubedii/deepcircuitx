Module name: half_adder_tb. 
Module specification: The `half_adder_tb` serves as a testbench specifically adapted to verify the functionality of a half adder circuit. The module takes no external inputs or outputs but internally utilizes two register (`reg`) types, `a` and `b`, to deliver stimulus input to the half adder designated as `dut`. The outputs from this half adder are captured by two wire signals, `s` (sum) and `c` (carry), where `s` represents the resultant sum of `a` and `b`, and `c` reflects the carry resulting from the addition. The code consists of an initial block that sequentially assigns combinations of 0 and 1 to `a` and `b` with a delay of 10 units in between before terminating the simulation with `$finish`. This structured stimulus ensures rigorous verification of the half adder under varied input conditions, ensuring the correct operation of its sum and carry calculations.
