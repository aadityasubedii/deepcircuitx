Module-level comment: The 'half_subtractor' module implements a basic binary subtraction between two single-bit inputs, 'a' and 'b'. It generates a 'difference' bit ('d') through an XOR gate and a 'borrow out' ('bo') via an AND gate of the complement of 'a' and 'b', representing the elementary subtractive operation without borrow chain consideration.
