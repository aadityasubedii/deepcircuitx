The difference is calculated using an XOR gate applied to inputs a and b, and the borrow out is determined by applying an AND gate to ~a (the complement of a) and b. This represents the basic operation of subtracting b from a without considering any borrow from previous less significant bits."

The output bit 'd' represents the digit-wise subtraction considering no borrow from the previous less significant bit. The output port 'bo' stands for \"borrow out\", which results from the AND operation between the complement of 'a' (~a) and 'b'.
