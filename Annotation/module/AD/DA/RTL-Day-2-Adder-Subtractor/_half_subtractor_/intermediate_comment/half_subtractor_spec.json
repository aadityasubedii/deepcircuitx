    "spec": "Module name: half_subtractor. Module specification: The 'half_subtractor' module is designed to perform binary subtraction of two single bits, commonly known as minuend 'a' and subtrahend 'b'. It provides two outputs: 'd' representing the difference and 'bo' indicating the borrow out. The difference 'd' is calculated using an XOR gate that takes inputs 'a' and 'b', reflecting the basic subtraction operation without considering any previous borrow. The borrow out 'bo' is derived from an AND gate applying to the complement of 'a' (~a) and 'b', signifying if a borrow is needed for subtraction in a more significant bit. No internal signals are employed within this module as all calculations are directly handled using the input and output ports. The code consists of straightforward XOR and AND operations, directly mapping the logic of bit-wise subtraction into hardware description, aligning perfectly with the circuit's intent to facilitate simple subtraction tasks.",
