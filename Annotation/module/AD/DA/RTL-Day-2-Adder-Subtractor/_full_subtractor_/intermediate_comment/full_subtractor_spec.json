    "spec": "Module name: full_subtractor. Module specification: The \"full_subtractor\" module is designed to perform binary subtraction on three input bits, namely a, b, and cin, which correspond to the minuend, the subtrahend, and an optional borrow from a less significant bit, respectively. The module outputs two bits: 'd', which is the difference result, and 'bo', which indicates if a borrow is needed (borrow out). Internally, the module utilizes three wires, w1, w2, and w3, to facilitate the borrow detection logic. 'w1' is used to determine if a borrow is needed when 'b' is greater than 'a', 'w2' identifies a borrow condition when 'b' is absent but 'cin' is present, and 'w3' checks for a borrow when both 'b' and 'cin' are present. The main logic of the module includes a XOR gate that calculates the difference 'd', and an OR gate coupled with three AND gates that determine the borrow out 'bo'. This organization allows the full_subtractor to effectively manage the binary subtraction inclusive of potential borrows from previous computations, providing essential functionality for multi-bit subtractive operations.\n",
