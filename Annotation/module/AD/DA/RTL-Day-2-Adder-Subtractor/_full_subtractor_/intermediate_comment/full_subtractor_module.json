    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"full_subtractor\" module conducts binary subtraction on inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin' to produce the difference 'd' and the borrow-out 'bo'. It combines a XOR gate for calculating 'd', and an OR gate fed by three AND gates to determine the borrow condition 'bo', effectively supporting multi-bit subtractive operations."
