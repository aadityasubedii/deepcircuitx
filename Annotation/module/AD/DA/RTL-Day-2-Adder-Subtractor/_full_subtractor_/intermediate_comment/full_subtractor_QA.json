The output 'd' is the difference of the inputs, and 'bo' is the borrow out. The difference 'd' is calculated using a XOR gate that processes inputs a, b, and cin. The borrow out 'bo' is determined by an OR gate, which gets inputs from three AND gates. Each AND gate helps to identify conditions under which a borrow occurs: when 'a' is not present but 'b' is, when 'b' is not present but 'cin' is, and when both 'b' and 'cin' are present, respectively."
