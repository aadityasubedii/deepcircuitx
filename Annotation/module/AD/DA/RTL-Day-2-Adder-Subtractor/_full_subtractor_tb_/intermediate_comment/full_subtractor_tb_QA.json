The full subtractor itself is not defined within this code; it is assumed to be a separate module named `full_subtractor` that the testbench instantiates as `dut` (device under test). The testbench drives inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin` (carry input) to the full subtractor and observes outputs `d` (difference) and `bo` (borrow output). The test proceeds by applying various combinations of binary inputs to `a`, `b`, and `cin` every 10 time units, checking the behavior of the full subtractor for different subtraction scenarios. The `$finish` statement at the end of the initial block stops the simulation after all test cases have been applied."

The port `cin` is the carry-in (or borrow-in) input, which is a single-bit binary number and is considered during the subtraction if there was a borrow from a previous less significant bit.\n\nOutput ports: `d`, `bo`. \nExplanation: The output port `d` represents the difference of the subtraction operation, which is a single-bit binary number.
