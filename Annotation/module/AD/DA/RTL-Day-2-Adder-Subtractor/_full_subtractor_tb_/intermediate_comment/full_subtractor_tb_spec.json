Module specification: The `full_subtractor_tb` module serves as a testbench for verifying the functionality of a full subtractor circuit, which is instantiated as a separate module named `full_subtractor` within this testbench. The module utilizes five principal signals: the input ports `a`, `b`, and `cin`, where `a` and `b` represent the two single-bit binary numbers to be subtracted, and `cin` is the carry-in or borrow-in for scenarios involving serial subtraction across multiple bits. The outputs from the `full_subtractor` module are captured on two wires, `d` and `bo`, with `d` representing the single-bit binary result of the subtraction and `bo` indicating whether a borrow was produced that would affect the subtraction of the next higher bit pair. Internally, this testbench does not possess any significant logic or state-holding signals of its own but rather focuses on driving specific combinations of input binaries to the `full_subtractor` and examining the outputs at structured time intervals. The sequence of testing involves the application of various binary combinations to the inputs every 10 time units, observing the corresponding outputs, and thereby allowing assessment of the correctness of the `full_subtractor`. The simulation is concluded with a `$finish` command after all test cases have been examined.",
