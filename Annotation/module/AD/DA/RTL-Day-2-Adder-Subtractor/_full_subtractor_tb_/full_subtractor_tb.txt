Module-level comment: The `full_subtractor_tb` module tests the `full_subtractor` circuit by driving specific input sequences (`a`, `b`, `cin`) and monitoring the outputs (`d`, `bo`). It simulates binary subtraction scenarios, applying varying input combinations every 10 time units to check the corresponding outputs for accuracy. The test concludes with a `$finish` after all scenarios to stop the simulation. This ensures the correct behavior of the full subtractor logic.
