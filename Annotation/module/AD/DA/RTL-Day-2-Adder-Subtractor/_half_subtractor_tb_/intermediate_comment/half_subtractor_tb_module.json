    "module": "Module-level comment: The `half_subtractor_tb` module tests a half subtractor circuit by applying all combinations of binary inputs (`a`, `b`) and observing outputs (`d`, `bo`). Utilizing an initial block, it cycles through input states every 10 time units, validating the correct behavior of difference and borrow logic before finishing the simulation."
