A half subtractor takes two binary digits as input and produces two outputs: the difference (d) and borrow out (bo). The testbench applies various combinations of inputs to the half subtractor and observes the outputs over a sequence of time steps to validate its behavior. The test sequences include all possible input combinations (00, 01, 10, 11) with each condition held for 10 time units before moving to the next. The simulation concludes after these tests are conducted."
