Module name: half_subtractor_tb. Module specification: The `half_subtractor_tb` is a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of a half subtractor circuit. The half subtractor is a combinational circuit that computes the subtraction of two single-bit binary numbers, providing the difference (d) and the borrow out (bo). This testbench module simulates and evaluates the half subtractor across different input conditions. It comprises two input ports: `a` and `b`, which serve as the minuend and the subtrahend, respectively, in the subtraction operation. The output ports are `d`, yielding the difference of `a` and `b`, and `bo`, indicating a binary borrow when `b` is larger than `a`. There are no internal signals within this testbench as it focuses on input stimulation and output observation, without any additional internal processing logic. The Verilog code for the testbench includes an initial block that sequentially applies all possible binary input combinations to the half subtractor, holding each for 10 time units, before invoking the `$finish` command to end the simulation after the test cases are exhausted.
