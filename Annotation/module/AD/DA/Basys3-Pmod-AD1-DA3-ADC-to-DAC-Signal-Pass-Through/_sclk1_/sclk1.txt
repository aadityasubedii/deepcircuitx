Module-level comment: The 'sclk1' Verilog module functions as a clock divider, producing an output 'sclk1' with half the frequency of the input 'clock'. It employs a 25-bit counter 'count' that increments at each positive 'clock' edge and toggles 'sclk1' every two cycles, unless reset by an active-high 'reset' signal, which also resets 'count' and 'sclk1' to 0. The module uses an initial block for default settings and an always block triggered by 'clock' edges for logic implementation.
