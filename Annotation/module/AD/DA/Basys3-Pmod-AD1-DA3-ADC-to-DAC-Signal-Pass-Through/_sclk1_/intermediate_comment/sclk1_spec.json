    "spec": "Module name: sclk1.\nModule specification: The 'sclk1' module is a clock divider that generates an output signal 'sclk1' with half the frequency of the input 'clock' signal. The module has two input ports: 'clock', which is a periodic signal that drives the internal counting logic, and 'reset', which is an active-high signal that, when asserted, resets both the 'count' register and the 'sclk1' output to their initial state (0). The sole output port is 'sclk1', a reg type signal that toggles its value every two cycles of the 'clock' input when 'reset' is not asserted, thus functioning as a divided clock output. Internally, 'sclk1' maintains a 25-bit register named 'count', which serves as a counter incrementing on each positive edge of 'clock' and resetting to 0 upon reaching a count value of 1 or when 'reset' is active. There are two main blocks in the code: an 'initial' block that sets the initial values for 'count' and 'sclk1', and an 'always' block that describes the sensitivity to the rising edge of 'clock'. The 'always' block outlines the reset condition as well as the counting and toggle logic, managing the state transitions for 'count' and the toggling event for 'sclk1'.",
