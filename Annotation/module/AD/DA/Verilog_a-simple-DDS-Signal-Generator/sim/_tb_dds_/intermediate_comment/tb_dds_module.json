    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'tb_dds' module acts as a testbench for verifying the 'dds' waveform generator by providing a stimuli environment. It uses an initial block to sequence signal states, including system reset and varied waveform selections, while an always block toggles the clock signal to drive the simulation, ensuring dynamic operation and response validation of the 'dds' module."
