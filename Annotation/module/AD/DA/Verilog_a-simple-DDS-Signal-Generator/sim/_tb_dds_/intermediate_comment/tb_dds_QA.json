In the testbench, different wave signals are selected through the `wave_select` signal while issuing data outputs via `data_out`. The simulation involves initializing various signals and toggling the system clock. It tests transitions of wave selections under a controlled clock environment, checking how the 'dds' module reacts to reset conditions and different wave selections over time. The wave selection changes periodically, and the system reset is deasserted before wave selections are applied, typical for verifying the behavior of waveform-generating modules."

The simulation in this testbench applies different patterns to this port to test the DDS output for various wave types.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation:\n- data_out: This is an 8-bit output signal from the 'dds' module representing the generated waveform's data.

This clock signal is toggled every 10 ns within the testbench to simulate a real-world clock.\n- sys_rst_n: An active-low reset signal used internally to reset the 'dds' module at the beginning of the simulation.

This selection is part of what is being tested in the testbench, as this signal's changes trigger different responses in the 'dds' module's output.\n- data_out: An 8-bit signal that represents the output of the 'dds' module, showing how the module responds to the different wave_select inputs.
