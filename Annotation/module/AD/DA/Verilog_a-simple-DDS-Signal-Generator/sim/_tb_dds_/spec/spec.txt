Module name: tb_dds. Module specification: The module 'tb_dds' functions as a testbench designed to verify the operation of a waveform-generating module identified as 'dds'. It simulates waveform selection and outputs using thoroughly structured inputs and clock-driven transitions. The module includes three input ports: 'sys_clk', 'sys_rst_n', and 'wave_select'. 'sys_clk' is a clock signal that drives the timing for the module's operations, toggling every 10ns. 'sys_rst_n' is an active-low reset signal used to initialize the 'dds' module at the start of the simulation, ensuring it begins in a known state. 'wave_select' is a 4-bit input used to switch between different wave-form outputs during simulation. The sole output port, 'data_out', delivers an 8-bit representation of the waveform data produced by the 'dds' module in response to the 'wave_select' input. Internally, the signals employed mirror the input and output ports, closely monitoring and controlling the dynamics of waveform generation and system initialization. The testbench code is structured into two primary blocks: an 'initial' block, intended for setting initial values and defining signal transitions over time, and an 'always' block that continuously toggles the 'sys_clk' signal, ensuring consistent clock pulses throughout the test scenario. Through its comprehensive simulation controls and setups, 'tb_dds' guarantees that the 'dds' module's functionality under various conditions is properly assessed, validating the correct generation of waveforms across different selections.
