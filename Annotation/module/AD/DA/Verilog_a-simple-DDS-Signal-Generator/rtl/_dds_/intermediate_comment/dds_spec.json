    "spec": "Module name: dds. Module specification: The `dds` module is a Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) waveform generator designed to output different types of waveforms based on a selected input. The module operates with a system clock (`sys_clk`), an active low reset (`sys_rst_n`), and a 4-bit waveform selector (`wave_select`). The `data_out` serves as an 8-bit output delivering pre-calculated waveform samples from a ROM. Internally, `fre_add` acts as a frequency control accumulator, incrementally adjusted each clock cycle, unless reset. `rom_addr_reg` calculates an intermediate ROM address, which, along with additional waveform-specific offsets, determines the final ROM address (`rom_addr`). These addresses fetch appropriate waveform data via different operation blocks: \n1. A frequency accumulation block effectively controls waveform frequency by adjusting `fre_add` based on the clock and reset conditions.\n2. An address calculation block that employs a case statement, based on the `wave_select` input, to output the correct waveform by adjusting `rom_addr_reg` and `rom_addr` for accessing different sections of the ROM.\n3. A ROM instance (`rom_16384x8_inst`) maps the final ROM address to the output port, delivering the waveform data corresponding to the selected type. This structured design allows the module to generate sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waves determined by waveform-specific ROM lookups, making the `dds` module versatile in signal generation applications.",

            "content": "Name of the module and its functionality is as follows: \nModule name: dds.\nExplanation: The module, named 'dds,' is a Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) waveform generator. The module takes a system clock (`sys_clk`), an active low reset signal (`sys_rst_n`), and a `wave_select` input to choose between different waveform types. The output is an 8-bit data signal (`data_out`) representing the generated waveform value. The supported waveforms are sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth, each selected by a unique 4-bit code. The module uses a read-only memory (ROM) module `rom_16384x8`, which stores pre-calculated samples of the waveforms.\n\nIts operation consists of two main parts:\n1. An accumulator (`fre_add`) which increments by a fixed `FREQ_CTRL` value on every clock cycle unless reset by an active low reset signal. This value helps determine the frequency of the generated waveform.\n2. A case statement that adjusts the ROM lookup address (`rom_addr_reg` and `rom_addr`) depending on the selected waveform type. The ROM address is calculated based on adding the phase control value (`PHASE_CTRL`) to the most significant bits of the accumulator, with an additional offset for non-sine waveforms to fetch the corresponding waveform data from the ROM. The result is produced at `data_out` through the ROM instance `rom_16384x8_inst` on every clock cycle."

Different binary values of this input select between sine wave, square wave, triangle wave, and sawtooth wave.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation:\n- `data_out` is an 8-bit output that delivers the waveform data. This output is driven by the ROM (`rom_16384x8` instance), which stores pre-calculated samples of each waveform.

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: fre_add, rom_addr_reg, rom_addr.\n\nExplanation:\n- `fre_add` is a 32-bit internal register used as an accumulator for frequency control. It increments by a predetermined value specified by the `FREQ_CTRL` parameter in every clock cycle if the system is not in a reset state. This register plays a crucial role in controlling the frequency of the generated waveform by determining the pace at which the ROM addresses are accessed.\n\n- `rom_addr_reg` is a 12-bit internal register that temporarily stores the computed ROM address based on the most significant bits of the `fre_add` register and the phase control value (`PHASE_CTRL`). This register's value is directly influenced by the waveform type selected by `wave_select`. It serves as an intermediary step in calculating the final ROM address (`rom_addr`) used to fetch waveform data from the ROM.\n\n- `rom_addr` is a 14-bit internal register that holds the final ROM address used to access the waveform data in the ROM (`rom_16384x8` instance). The value of this register is determined by adding specific offsets to `rom_addr_reg` depending on the selected waveform type (sin, square, triangle, saw). This address calculation ensures that each waveform type is fetched from its dedicated section within the ROM, facilitating the output of the correct waveform through the `data_out` port."
