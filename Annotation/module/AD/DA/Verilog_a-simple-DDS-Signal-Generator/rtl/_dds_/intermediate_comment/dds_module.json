    "module": "Module-level comment: The `dds` module generates diverse waveforms (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth) by employing Direct Digital Synthesis. It uses a system clock, an active-low reset, and a waveform selection input to control frequency and select waveform type. Internally, frequency control and ROM address calculation are managed through registers `fre_add`, `rom_addr_reg`, and `rom_addr`. The output waveform is extracted from ROM based on the computed address, enabling precise waveform generation."
