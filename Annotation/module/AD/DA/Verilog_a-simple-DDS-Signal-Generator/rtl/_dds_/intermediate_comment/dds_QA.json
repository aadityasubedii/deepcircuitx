The module takes a system clock (`sys_clk`), an active low reset signal (`sys_rst_n`), and a `wave_select` input to choose between different waveform types. The output is an 8-bit data signal (`data_out`) representing the generated waveform value. The supported waveforms are sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth, each selected by a unique 4-bit code. The module uses a read-only memory (ROM) module `rom_16384x8`, which stores pre-calculated samples of the waveforms.\n\nIts operation consists of two main parts:\n1. An accumulator (`fre_add`) which increments by a fixed `FREQ_CTRL` value on every clock cycle unless reset by an active low reset signal. This value helps determine the frequency of the generated waveform.\n2. A case statement that adjusts the ROM lookup address (`rom_addr_reg` and `rom_addr`) depending on the selected waveform type. The ROM address is calculated based on adding the phase control value (`PHASE_CTRL`) to the most significant bits of the accumulator, with an additional offset for non-sine waveforms to fetch the corresponding waveform data from the ROM. The result is produced at `data_out` through the ROM instance `rom_16384x8_inst` on every clock cycle."

Different binary values of this input select between sine wave, square wave, triangle wave, and sawtooth wave.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation:\n- `data_out` is an 8-bit output that delivers the waveform data.
