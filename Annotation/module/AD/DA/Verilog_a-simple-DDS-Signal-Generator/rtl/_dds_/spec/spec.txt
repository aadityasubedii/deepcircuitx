Module name: dds. Module specification: The `dds` module is a Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) waveform generator designed to output different types of waveforms based on a selected input. The module operates with a system clock (`sys_clk`), an active low reset (`sys_rst_n`), and a 4-bit waveform selector (`wave_select`). The `data_out` serves as an 8-bit output delivering pre-calculated waveform samples from a ROM. Internally, `fre_add` acts as a frequency control accumulator, incrementally adjusted each clock cycle, unless reset. `rom_addr_reg` calculates an intermediate ROM address, which, along with additional waveform-specific offsets, determines the final ROM address (`rom_addr`). These addresses fetch appropriate waveform data via different operation blocks: 
1. A frequency accumulation block effectively controls waveform frequency by adjusting `fre_add` based on the clock and reset conditions.
2. An address calculation block that employs a case statement, based on the `wave_select` input, to output the correct waveform by adjusting `rom_addr_reg` and `rom_addr` for accessing different sections of the ROM.
3. A ROM instance (`rom_16384x8_inst`) maps the final ROM address to the output port, delivering the waveform data corresponding to the selected type. This structured design allows the module to generate sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waves determined by waveform-specific ROM lookups, making the `dds` module versatile in signal generation applications.
