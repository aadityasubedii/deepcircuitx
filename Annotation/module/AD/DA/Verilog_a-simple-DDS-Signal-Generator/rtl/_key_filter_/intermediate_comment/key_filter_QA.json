It takes an input key signal (`key_in`), a system clock (`sys_clk`), and a system reset signal (`sys_rst_n`). The module produces an output signal (`key_flag`) that indicates whether the key input has been stable (not pressed) for a specified duration, set by the parameter `CNT_max`, which defaults to a count of 99,9999 in a 20-bit register. Upon each positive edge of the system clock or the negative edge of the reset signal, if the reset signal is low, the counter (`cnt_20ms`) is reset to 0. If the key input is high (pressed), the counter is reset to 0. If the counter reaches the maximum count (`CNT_max`) without the key being pressed again (indicated by `key_in` being low), the counter stops incrementing, and the `key_flag` is set high in the next cycle, indicating a stable, debounced key press. Once the condition is met (counter equals `CNT_max` - 1), the `key_flag` is set high; otherwise, it is kept low. This helps in filtering out potential bounce signals from mechanical keys/switches, ensuring a stable and clean signal transition for further processing."

Its role is to count the number of clock cycles that have elapsed while the `key_in` signal remains low (unpressed). The value of `cnt_20ms` is compared against the specified maximum count `CNT_max`, and when it reaches this count (assuming the key has not been pressed again), it causes the debounced output `key_flag` to be asserted high to signal that the input has been stable for a sufficiently long duration. If `key_in` becomes high (key is pressed), the counter resets to 0 to restart the debounce timing. In case of a system reset (`sys_rst_n` being low), `cnt_20ms` is also reset to 0. The counter stops incrementing when it equals `CNT_max` and `key_in` is low, effectively signaling a stable state which is then used to set the `key_flag` output in the subsequent logic block."
