    "spec": "Module name: key_filter.\nModule specification: The key_filter module employs a debouncing mechanism to process a noisy key input signal (key_in) into a stable signal (key_flag). Designed to work with a system clock (sys_clk) and an active-low system reset (sys_rst_n), the module counts clock cycles to determine the stability of key_in. If key_in remains unpressed for a span outlined by CNT_max (default 20'd99_9999), the key_flag is asserted to indicate a debounced signal. The input ports include sys_clk for synchronization of the module's operations, sys_rst_n for resetting the module's state, and key_in for receiving the raw, potentially bouncing signal from the key. The singular output port, key_flag, signifies the stable, debounced state of the key. Internally, cnt_20ms (a 20-bit counter) records the time the key_in remains unpressed. The module encompasses two always-blocks: the first block manages the cnt_20ms by resetting it during a low sys_rst_n signal or when key_in is pressed, and maintains its value when the counter reaches CNT_max with key_in unpressed; otherwise, it increments the counter. The second block handles key_flag output by resetting it when sys_rst_n is low, setting it high when cnt_20ms matches CNT_max - 1, indicating a stable input, and resetting otherwise to ensure a clear indication of a debounced signal. This structured approach ensures accurate and reliable key press detection in noisy environments.",

It takes an input key signal (`key_in`), a system clock (`sys_clk`), and a system reset signal (`sys_rst_n`). The module produces an output signal (`key_flag`) that indicates whether the key input has been stable (not pressed) for a specified duration, set by the parameter `CNT_max`, which defaults to a count of 99,9999 in a 20-bit register. Upon each positive edge of the system clock or the negative edge of the reset signal, if the reset signal is low, the counter (`cnt_20ms`) is reset to 0. If the key input is high (pressed), the counter is reset to 0. If the counter reaches the maximum count (`CNT_max`) without the key being pressed again (indicated by `key_in` being low), the counter stops incrementing, and the `key_flag` is set high in the next cycle, indicating a stable, debounced key press. Once the condition is met (counter equals `CNT_max` - 1), the `key_flag` is set high; otherwise, it is kept low. This helps in filtering out potential bounce signals from mechanical keys/switches, ensuring a stable and clean signal transition for further processing."

Its role is to count the number of clock cycles that have elapsed while the `key_in` signal remains low (unpressed). The value of `cnt_20ms` is compared against the specified maximum count `CNT_max`, and when it reaches this count (assuming the key has not been pressed again), it causes the debounced output `key_flag` to be asserted high to signal that the input has been stable for a sufficiently long duration. If `key_in` becomes high (key is pressed), the counter resets to 0 to restart the debounce timing. In case of a system reset (`sys_rst_n` being low), `cnt_20ms` is also reset to 0. The counter stops incrementing when it equals `CNT_max` and `key_in` is low, effectively signaling a stable state which is then used to set the `key_flag` output in the subsequent logic block."
