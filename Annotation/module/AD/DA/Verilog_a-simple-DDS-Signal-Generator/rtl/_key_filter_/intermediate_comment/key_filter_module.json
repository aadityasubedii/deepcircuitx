    "module": "Module-level comment: The key_filter module debounces a noisy key input signal (key_in) by employing a 20-bit counter (cnt_20ms) to track unpressed duration and setting an output (key_flag) when stable. It resets upon a low system reset (sys_rst_n) or key press and stops counting when max is reached. This design ensures reliable key press detection using clock-driven, conditional logic for stability verification."
