It accepts a system clock ('sys_clk'), an active-low system reset signal ('sys_rst_n'), and a 4-bit user input ('key') to produce an 8-bit digital output ('dac_data') for the DAC, along with a corresponding DAC clock ('dac_clk'). Specifically, 'sys_clk' is the primary synchronization signal, 'sys_rst_n' is used to reset the internal state of the module, and the 'key' input selects operational modes or functions. The 'dac_data' port delivers digital data to the DAC, and the 'dac_clk', which is the negation of 'sys_clk', serves as a timing reference for when the DAC should sample this data. Internally, a 4-bit signal 'wave_select' is used to convey the selected waveform type from the 'key_control' submodule to the 'dds' submodule, which generates the digital signal for the DAC based on this selection. The 'key_control' submodule interprets the 'key' input and determines the 'wave_select', while the 'dds' submodule uses 'wave_select' to output the corresponding waveform to 'dac_data'.
