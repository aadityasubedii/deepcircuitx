    "spec": "Module name: key_control.\nModule specification: The 'key_control' module is a waveform selector that chooses different waveform outputs dependent on user input via keys. Using the 'sys_clk' as the system clock input, it synchronizes the processes within the module, specifically the updating of waveform selections. The 'sys_rst_n', an active-low system reset, initializes the 'wave_select' output to zero, ensuring a known starting state. The 4-bit input 'key' detects which of the four keys has been pressed. Based on this input, the 'wave_select' 4-bit output specifies the chosen waveform type - sine, square, triangle, or sawtooth - each represented by a unique 4-bit code. Internally, the module uses signals 'key0' to 'key3' to hold the debounced signals from the 'key_filter' submodule outputs, which correspond to the four key inputs. These signals ensure stable waveform selection changes in response to key presses. The code features a sequential always block, responding to either the positive edge of the system clock or the negative edge of the reset signal, to update the 'wave_select' output accordingly. Furthermore, the module instantiates four 'key_filter' blocks, one for each key input, to generate debounced 'key_flag' signals for robust key press detection. These filters hook into the primary control logic through the aforementioned internal signals, driving the selection logic in the always block.",

It has inputs for a system clock (`sys_clk`), system reset (`sys_rst_n`), and a 4-bit input (`key`) representing the state of four keys. Depending on which key is pressed, the module sets the `wave_select` output to one of four predefined waveforms (sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth) represented by unique 4-bit codes.

Explanation: These internal signals are used as intermediaries to carry debounced or filtered key press signals from the `key_filter` instances to the main logic in the `key_control` module. Specifically, they serve the following roles:\n\n- `key0`: Holds the debounced signal for the first key (`key[0]`). When this signal is asserted (`1`), it indicates that the first key has been pressed and triggers the selection of the sine wave (`sin_wave`) as the output waveform.\n  \n- `key1`: Holds the debounced signal for the second key (`key[1]`). When this signal is asserted (`1`), it indicates that the second key has been pressed and triggers the selection of the square wave (`squ_wave`) as the output waveform.\n\n- `key2`: Holds the debounced signal for the third key (`key[2]`). When this signal is asserted (`1`), it indicates that the third key has been pressed and triggers the selection of the triangle wave (`tri_wave`) as the output waveform.\n\n- `key3`: Holds the debounced signal for the fourth key (`key[3]`). When this signal is asserted (`1`), it indicates that the fourth key has been pressed and triggers the selection of the sawtooth wave (`saw_wave`) as the output waveform.\n\nEach of these signals is a result of a `key_filter` process, which likely includes debounce logic to ensure that the waveform selection reacts to a clean, stable press rather than noisy, rapid changes in the key input state. This mechanism allows for a precise selection of the waveform output based on the pressed key."
