It has inputs for a system clock (`sys_clk`), system reset (`sys_rst_n`), and a 4-bit input (`key`) representing the state of four keys. Depending on which key is pressed, the module sets the `wave_select` output to one of four predefined waveforms (sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth) represented by unique 4-bit codes. The waveform selection is updated on every positive edge of the system clock or negative edge of the system reset. The module uses instances of another module named `key_filter` to debounce or filter each key input before determining which waveform to select."

When asserted (`0`), it initializes the `wave_select` output to zero, resetting the waveform selection.\n- `key`: A 4-bit input where each bit represents the state of a corresponding key. These inputs are used to determine which waveform to select based on which key is pressed.\n\nOutput ports: wave_select. Explanation: \n- `wave_select`: A 4-bit output that represents the selected waveform type.

Explanation: These internal signals are used as intermediaries to carry debounced or filtered key press signals from the `key_filter` instances to the main logic in the `key_control` module. Specifically, they serve the following roles:\n\n- `key0`: Holds the debounced signal for the first key (`key[0]`). When this signal is asserted (`1`), it indicates that the first key has been pressed and triggers the selection of the sine wave (`sin_wave`) as the output waveform.\n  \n- `key1`: Holds the debounced signal for the second key (`key[1]`). When this signal is asserted (`1`), it indicates that the second key has been pressed and triggers the selection of the square wave (`squ_wave`) as the output waveform.\n\n- `key2`: Holds the debounced signal for the third key (`key[2]`). When this signal is asserted (`1`), it indicates that the third key has been pressed and triggers the selection of the triangle wave (`tri_wave`) as the output waveform.\n\n- `key3`: Holds the debounced signal for the fourth key (`key[3]`). When this signal is asserted (`1`), it indicates that the fourth key has been pressed and triggers the selection of the sawtooth wave (`saw_wave`) as the output waveform.\n\nEach of these signals is a result of a `key_filter` process, which likely includes debounce logic to ensure that the waveform selection reacts to a clean, stable press rather than noisy, rapid changes in the key input state. This mechanism allows for a precise selection of the waveform output based on the pressed key."
