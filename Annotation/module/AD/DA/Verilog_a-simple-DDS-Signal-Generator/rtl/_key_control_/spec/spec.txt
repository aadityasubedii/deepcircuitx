Module name: key_control.
Module specification: The 'key_control' module is a waveform selector that chooses different waveform outputs dependent on user input via keys. Using the 'sys_clk' as the system clock input, it synchronizes the processes within the module, specifically the updating of waveform selections. The 'sys_rst_n', an active-low system reset, initializes the 'wave_select' output to zero, ensuring a known starting state. The 4-bit input 'key' detects which of the four keys has been pressed. Based on this input, the 'wave_select' 4-bit output specifies the chosen waveform type - sine, square, triangle, or sawtooth - each represented by a unique 4-bit code. Internally, the module uses signals 'key0' to 'key3' to hold the debounced signals from the 'key_filter' submodule outputs, which correspond to the four key inputs. These signals ensure stable waveform selection changes in response to key presses. The code features a sequential always block, responding to either the positive edge of the system clock or the negative edge of the reset signal, to update the 'wave_select' output accordingly. Furthermore, the module instantiates four 'key_filter' blocks, one for each key input, to generate debounced 'key_flag' signals for robust key press detection. These filters hook into the primary control logic through the aforementioned internal signals, driving the selection logic in the always block.
