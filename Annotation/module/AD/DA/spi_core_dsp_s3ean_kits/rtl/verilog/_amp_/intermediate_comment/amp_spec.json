    "spec": "Module name: amp. Module specification: The \"amp\" module interfaces with an SPI device for communication purposes, primarily used in microcontrollers. The module has five input ports namely, `spi_clk` (SPI clock for syncing communication), `reset` (resets internal states and data), `cs` (chip select to enable/disable data reception), and `din` (input data bit), along with two output ports: `dout` (outputs the last bit of the internal data register on falling edge of `spi_clk`), and `gain_state` (an 8-bit output reflecting internal state, tristated on reset). Internally, it utilizes signals such as `data` (an 8-bit register for temporary data storage), `temp` (stores the MSB from `data`), and `dout` (outputs the relevant bit to the external circuit). The module is broken down into three main procedural blocks: one handling the output of `gain_state` based on reset or `cs` conditions, another for managing data and `temp` registers at the positive edge of `spi_clk` during a reset or when `cs` is low, and a third that updates `dout` at the negative edge of `spi_clk`. These blocks ensure the correct sequencing and handling of input bits and state outputs in relation to the SPI clock and the module's reset state.",
