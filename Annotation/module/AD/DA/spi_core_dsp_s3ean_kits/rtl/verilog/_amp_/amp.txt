Module-level comment: The "amp" module interfaces with SPI devices, handling data based on the SPI clock. It manages inputs like `spi_clk`, `reset`, `cs`, and `din`, and outputs `dout` and `gain_state`. Internally, it uses registers (`data`, `temp`, `dout`) to store and shift incoming bits, updating outputs on clock edges. The module uses three always blocks to reset internal states, shift and load data, and manage output timings based on clock transitions, ensuring synchronized data handling with SPI protocols.
