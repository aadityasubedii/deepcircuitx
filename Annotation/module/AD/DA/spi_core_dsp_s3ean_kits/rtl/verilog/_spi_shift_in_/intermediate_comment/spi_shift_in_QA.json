It is a shift-in register which captures serial data on `s_in` based on the SPI clock signal `s_clk`. The operation of the module can be edge-sensitive, as determined by `pos_edge`, `neg_edge`, and `rx_negedge` inputs, allowing it to capture data on either the rising or falling edge of the SPI clock. \n\nThe module outputs a parallel word `p_out` once the serial data capturing is complete. 'tip' is a control signal indicating that the module is currently in the process of receiving data, and 'last' indicates the reception of the last bit. The internal register `data` holds the incoming serial data temporarily, and `cnt` keeps track of the current bit position during the reception process. After a reset (`rst`), or once the entire data word is received, the module can be triggered again by the `go` signal to start a new reception cycle. The parameter `Tp` allows for timing adjustment, potentially to meet setup and hold time requirements of the target technology or to synchronize with other system components."

All state transitions and data captures occur at the rising edge of this clock.\n- rst: This is the reset signal. When set high (asserted), it initializes the module's internal states and registers, pushing the module into a known state.\n- go: This signal is the start control input.

This signal can be used to signify that the received data is now fully captured into the 'data' register and the output p_out should now hold the complete parallel data word.\n- p_out: Parallel data output, which holds the converted parallel form of the serial data received on s_in once the entire data sequence has been captured as per the configured SPI and edge settings."
