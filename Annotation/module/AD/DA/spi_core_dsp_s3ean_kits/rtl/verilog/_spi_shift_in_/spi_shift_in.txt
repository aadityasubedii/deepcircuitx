Module-level comment: The spi_shift_in module captures serial SPI data for ADC use, aligning with chosen SPI clock edges. It integrates a shifting mechanism controlled by `go` signal with selectable edge sensitivity (`pos_edge`, `neg_edge`, `rx_negedge`), using internal counters and data storage (`cnt`, `data`). Parallel output (`p_out`) is presented upon completion, indicated by `tip` and `last` flags.
