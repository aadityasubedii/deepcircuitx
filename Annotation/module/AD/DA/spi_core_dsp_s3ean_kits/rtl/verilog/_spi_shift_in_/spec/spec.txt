Module name: spi_shift_in. 
Module specification: The spi_shift_in module is designed for the reception of serial data via SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), particularly tuning into the data flow from an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The module leverages a range of input signals including `clk` (main clock), `rst` (reset), `go` (start signal), `pos_edge` and `neg_edge` (to capture serial data on the rising or falling edge of the SPI clock `s_clk`), and `rx_negedge` (to capture data on negative edge configurations). These inputs facilitate the module's configuration for different edge sensitivities and timing requirements. The output ports include `tip` (transfer-in-progress signal), `last` (indicates reception of the last bit), and `p_out` (parallel output data). Internally, the module uses `cnt` (counter for position tracking), `data` (temporary data storage), `rx_bit_pos` (bit position calculation), `rx_clk` (clock edge determination for data capture), and `len` (data length). The module encompasses three main blocks of logic in its code: the first handles the counter's behavior during reset and active shifting, the second manages the `tip` signal indicating an ongoing transfer, and the third takes care of loading bits into the `data` register as determined by the current configuration and state transitions. This structured approach ensures that data is captured correctly in alignment with the incoming SPI clock and edge configurations, readying the data for further use once fully received.
