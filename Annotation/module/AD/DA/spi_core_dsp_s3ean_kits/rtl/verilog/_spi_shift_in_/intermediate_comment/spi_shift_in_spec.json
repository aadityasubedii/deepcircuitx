    "spec": "Module name: spi_shift_in. \nModule specification: The spi_shift_in module is designed for the reception of serial data via SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), particularly tuning into the data flow from an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The module leverages a range of input signals including `clk` (main clock), `rst` (reset), `go` (start signal), `pos_edge` and `neg_edge` (to capture serial data on the rising or falling edge of the SPI clock `s_clk`), and `rx_negedge` (to capture data on negative edge configurations). These inputs facilitate the module's configuration for different edge sensitivities and timing requirements. The output ports include `tip` (transfer-in-progress signal), `last` (indicates reception of the last bit), and `p_out` (parallel output data). Internally, the module uses `cnt` (counter for position tracking), `data` (temporary data storage), `rx_bit_pos` (bit position calculation), `rx_clk` (clock edge determination for data capture), and `len` (data length). The module encompasses three main blocks of logic in its code: the first handles the counter's behavior during reset and active shifting, the second manages the `tip` signal indicating an ongoing transfer, and the third takes care of loading bits into the `data` register as determined by the current configuration and state transitions. This structured approach ensures that data is captured correctly in alignment with the incoming SPI clock and edge configurations, readying the data for further use once fully received.",

It is a shift-in register which captures serial data on `s_in` based on the SPI clock signal `s_clk`. The operation of the module can be edge-sensitive, as determined by `pos_edge`, `neg_edge`, and `rx_negedge` inputs, allowing it to capture data on either the rising or falling edge of the SPI clock. \n\nThe module outputs a parallel word `p_out` once the serial data capturing is complete. 'tip' is a control signal indicating that the module is currently in the process of receiving data, and 'last' indicates the reception of the last bit. The internal register `data` holds the incoming serial data temporarily, and `cnt` keeps track of the current bit position during the reception process. After a reset (`rst`), or once the entire data word is received, the module can be triggered again by the `go` signal to start a new reception cycle. The parameter `Tp` allows for timing adjustment, potentially to meet setup and hold time requirements of the target technology or to synchronize with other system components."

All state transitions and data captures occur at the rising edge of this clock.\n- rst: This is the reset signal. When set high (asserted), it initializes the module's internal states and registers, pushing the module into a known state.\n- go: This signal is the start control input. When asserted, it enables the module to start capturing serial data on the s_in input based on the SPI clock s_clk and chosen edge settings.\n- pos_edge: This input is used to configure the module to capture data on the rising edge of the SPI clock (s_clk).\n- neg_edge: This input is used to configure the module to capture data on the falling edge of the SPI clock (s_clk).\n- rx_negedge: A configuration input that determines whether data should be captured on the negative edge of the internal cnt signal.\n- s_clk: This is the SPI clock signal according to which data on the s_in is expected to be clocked. Not directly used for capturing but might impact the operation in edge-sensitive configurations.\n- s_in: Serial input data from an SPI device. Data bits are read from this line based on the SPI clock and edge configurations.\n\nOutput ports: tip, last, p_out.\nExplanation:\n- tip: 'Transfer-in-progress' signal; it is asserted high when the module is actively receiving data, indicating that the capture process of the SPI data is ongoing.\n- last: Indicates the reception of the last bit of data. This signal can be used to signify that the received data is now fully captured into the 'data' register and the output p_out should now hold the complete parallel data word.\n- p_out: Parallel data output, which holds the converted parallel form of the serial data received on s_in once the entire data sequence has been captured as per the configured SPI and edge settings."

Once a complete SPI data transaction is received, `data` represents the parallel output word that is eventually assigned to `p_out`.\n- `rx_bit_pos`: A wire that calculates the bit position for the incoming data bit. It adjusts the bit position index based on whether data should be captured on the rising or falling edge of `cnt` by accounting for `rx_negedge`.\n- `rx_clk`: A wire that determines the clock edge on which to capture the serial data bit from `s_in`. This signal is generated based on edge configuration inputs (`pos_edge`, `neg_edge`, and `rx_negedge`) and the state of the last bit flag.\n- `len`: A wire statically assigned with a constant value indicating the length of data (number of bits) to be received.
