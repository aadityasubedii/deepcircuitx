Module name: dac.

Module specification: The dac module is designed to simulate a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) interface that utilizes the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol for communication. It accepts serial input data (`din`) along with a clock signal (`spi_clk`), chip select (`cs`), and a reset signal as input ports. The `spi_clk` serves as a timing mechanism for sampling and shifting the input data into an internal register and controls the timing of the serialized data output (`dout`). The `reset` signal is used to clear the internal states of the module. When `cs` is active (low), the module starts shifting the `din` data into its internal shift register on each positive edge of `spi_clk`. The outputs of the module include a 4-bit command that represents the control command for the DAC, a 4-bit `dacN` used for DAC addressing or channel number, a 12-bit `dacDATA` representing the actual data for the DAC, and the serialized data output `dout`.

Internally, the module uses a 32-bit wide register (`data`) as a shift register to store the incoming serial data. It holds the sequence of bits received so far and provides bits for the `command`, `dacN`, and `dacDATA` outputs. A single-bit register `temp` stores the value of the most significant bit of the `data` register temporarily. It ensures proper sequential logic in the data shifting process.

The module comprises two main always blocks reflecting its functionality. The first always block is triggered on the positive edge of `spi_clk` or the positive edge of `reset`. It handles the conditioning of the internal `temp` and `data` registers based on the reset condition or when the `cs` signal is active. If a reset signal is received, internal registers are cleared. Otherwise, if `cs` is low, incoming `din` data is shifted into the `data` register, and `temp` is updated accordingly. The second always block is triggered on the negative edge of `spi_clk`, updating the `dout` output with the most significant bit of the `data` register. This structured logic effectively contributes to the conversion and interface process, adhering to SPI protocol specifics.
