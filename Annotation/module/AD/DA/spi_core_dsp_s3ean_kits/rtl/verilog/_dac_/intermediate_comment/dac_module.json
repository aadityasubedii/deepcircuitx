    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'dac' module functions as a SPI interface for DACs, serializing input data and outputting DAC control signals. It implements a 32-bit shift register to handle data on SPI clock edges, segmenting received data into command, address, and DAC data while also providing the MSB as serialized output."
