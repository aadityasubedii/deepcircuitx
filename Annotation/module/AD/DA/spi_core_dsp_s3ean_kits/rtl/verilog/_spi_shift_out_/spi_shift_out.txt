Module-level comment: The "spi_shift_out" module serializes parallel input data for SPI communication, outputting bits controlled by edge-triggered signals. It internally manages a data shift register, bit count, and state flags to coordinate transmission based on start triggers, clock edges, and reset conditions. The module uses edge detection and data loading mechanisms to maintain a consistent and correct SPI data transfer sequence.
