Module name: spi_shift_out.

Module specification: The "spi_shift_out" module is dedicated to managing the serial transmission of data according to the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocol. It converts parallel input data into a serial output and controls the data flow using various signaling inputs.

The input ports consist of the following:
- "clk" is the system clock that orchestrates the timing of the module operations.
- "rst" asynchronously resets the internal states.
- "len" determines the number of bits to shift out, defined to the width of `SPI_CHAR_LEN_BITS-1`.
- "lsb" specifies whether to shift out data starting with the least significant bit.
- "go" acts as a trigger signal to start the data transmission.
- "capture" is a control signal to load data from the parallel input into the module's register.
- "pos_edge" and "neg_edge" determine which clock edge triggers operations.
- "tx_negedge" decides whether to shift out data on the falling edge.
- "p_in" is a 24-bit wide parallel input that contains the data meant to be shifted out.

The output ports include:
- "tip" indicates whether a data transfer is currently active.
- "last" denotes that the module is sending the last bit.
- "s_out" outputs the shifted serial data bit.

Key internal signals:
- "cnt" acts as a counter to track the number of shifted bits.
- "data" registers the parallel input and then sequentially shifts out the bits.
- "tx_bit_pos" is a derived signal that calculates the current shifting bit position, which changes based on LSB/MSB-first mode.
- "tx_clk" is a generated clock signal derived from the edge controls and "last" output that dictates transmission clock pacing.

The Verilog code is structured into several blocks:
- The counter logic block, which maintains the count of transferred bits.
- The "tip" status flag block, which manages the active state of transmission.
- The serial output data ("s_out") handling block, which determines the bit to be outputted based on the current edge of the clock and the transmission status.
- The parallel input ("p_in") loading block, which captures data into the "data" register when it is not currently transmitting.
These blocks interact through conditional logic, primarily driven by the clock edge ("posedge clk") and reset signals, synchronizing data transfer with system operations.
