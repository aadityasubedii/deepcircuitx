    "spec": "Module name: spi_clgen.\nModule specification: The spi_clgen is a Verilog module specifically tailored for Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) systems to generate a clock signal `clk_out` derived from a reference input clock `clk_in` using a specified divider ratio. The module is capable of handling an enable function that starts or stops clock generation, an active-high reset that initializes internal states, and additional control through signals such as `go` and `last_clk` which assist in edge detection. Input ports include `clk_in` (reference clock), `rst` (reset), `enable` (clock generation control), `go` (edge detection control), `last_clk` (indicates the last clock cycle), and `divider` (determines clock periods). Output ports consist of `clk_out` (generated clock), `pos_edge` (indicates positive edge detection of `clk_out`), and `neg_edge` (indicates negative edge detection of `clk_out`). Internal signals include `cnt` (count register for division), `cnt_zero` (indicates when `cnt` hits zero), and `cnt_one` (indicates when `cnt` is one). The code features several always blocks that execute on the positive edge of `clk_in` or `rst`. The first block manages the counter's behavior and resetting mechanism using the divider value. The second block generates the output clock signal based on the `enable` signal, the division counter, and the `last_clk` condition. The third block produces the edge detection signals, `pos_edge` and `neg_edge`, using the counter state, the `enable` signal, and other controls like `go`. Overall, the module's operation is conditioned by the combinational logic and sequential always blocks that work in tandem to ensure the correct clock signal is outputted for the SPI's correct functioning.",

This module also tracks and outputs the positive edge (`pos_edge`) and negative edge (`neg_edge`) of the generated clock signal. It uses input signals for enabling/disabling the clock generation (`enable`), reset (`rst`), and determining last clock cycle (`last_clk`) along with the `go` signal which integrates into the edge detection logic. The clock output is controlled by a counter (`cnt`) which resets based on the divider value when it reaches zero or when explicitly enabled.

If low, the clock generation is disabled.\n- `go`: An input signal that can influence the edge detection logic, particularly when the clock generator is disabled.\n- `last_clk`: A signal indicating whether the last clock cycle has occurred, which plays a role in the output clock generation logic.\n- `divider`: A binary value that sets the divide ratio for the input clock. It determines the period of the generated clock.\n\nOutput ports: `clk_out`, `pos_edge`, `neg_edge`.\nExplanation:\n- `clk_out`: The output clock signal from the generator.

This register is pivotal in generating the output clock `clk_out` by controlling when it toggles.\n- `cnt_zero`: A wire that is asserted (i.e., becomes high) when the count register `cnt` reaches zero. It plays a critical role in reset logic and in deciding when to toggle the output clock `clk_out`.\n- `cnt_one`: Similar to `cnt_zero`, this wire is asserted when `cnt` equals one.
