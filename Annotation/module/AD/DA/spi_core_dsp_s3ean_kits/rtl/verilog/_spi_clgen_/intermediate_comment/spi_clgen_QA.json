This module also tracks and outputs the positive edge (`pos_edge`) and negative edge (`neg_edge`) of the generated clock signal. It uses input signals for enabling/disabling the clock generation (`enable`), reset (`rst`), and determining last clock cycle (`last_clk`) along with the `go` signal which integrates into the edge detection logic. The clock output is controlled by a counter (`cnt`) which resets based on the divider value when it reaches zero or when explicitly enabled. This setup is typically used in serial peripheral interface (SPI) applications to manage clock timings for data transfers."

This register is pivotal in generating the output clock `clk_out` by controlling when it toggles.\n- `cnt_zero`: A wire that is asserted (i.e., becomes high) when the count register `cnt` reaches zero.
