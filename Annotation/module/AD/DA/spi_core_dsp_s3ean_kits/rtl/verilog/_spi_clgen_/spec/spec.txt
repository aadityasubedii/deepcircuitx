Module name: spi_clgen.
Module specification: The spi_clgen is a Verilog module specifically tailored for Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) systems to generate a clock signal `clk_out` derived from a reference input clock `clk_in` using a specified divider ratio. The module is capable of handling an enable function that starts or stops clock generation, an active-high reset that initializes internal states, and additional control through signals such as `go` and `last_clk` which assist in edge detection. Input ports include `clk_in` (reference clock), `rst` (reset), `enable` (clock generation control), `go` (edge detection control), `last_clk` (indicates the last clock cycle), and `divider` (determines clock periods). Output ports consist of `clk_out` (generated clock), `pos_edge` (indicates positive edge detection of `clk_out`), and `neg_edge` (indicates negative edge detection of `clk_out`). Internal signals include `cnt` (count register for division), `cnt_zero` (indicates when `cnt` hits zero), and `cnt_one` (indicates when `cnt` is one). The code features several always blocks that execute on the positive edge of `clk_in` or `rst`. The first block manages the counter's behavior and resetting mechanism using the divider value. The second block generates the output clock signal based on the `enable` signal, the division counter, and the `last_clk` condition. The third block produces the edge detection signals, `pos_edge` and `neg_edge`, using the counter state, the `enable` signal, and other controls like `go`. Overall, the module's operation is conditioned by the combinational logic and sequential always blocks that work in tandem to ensure the correct clock signal is outputted for the SPI's correct functioning.
