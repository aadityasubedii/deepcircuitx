Module-level comment: This Verilog module sets configuration for an SPI communication interface. It uses preprocessor directives to define and customize parameters such as clock divider length, maximum transfer character size, and the number of slave select lines. Control constants manage transmission details like edge polarity and order of data bits. These settings allow for flexible adaptation to specific SPI protocol needs.
