    "spec": "Module name: SPI_Configurable_Module\n\nModule specification: The SPI_Configurable_Module is designed to facilitate Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication with flexible configuration based on predefined constants. The module's functionality revolves around setting up SPI communication parameters such as clock divider length, maximum character size, number of Slave Select lines, and control options via preprocessor directives. Input and output ports likely include SPI specific signals like SCLK, MOSI, MISO, and SS, though the exact definitions are not provided in the snippet. Internal signals, conjectured from the defines and typical SPI module behavior, might include clk_divider for adjusting the SPI clock frequency, char_length for defining the frame size, and num_ss_lines for selecting among multiple slave devices. The code contains sections primarily for configuring various parameters such as SPI_DIVIDER_LEN, SPI_MAX_CHAR, SPI_CHAR_LEN_BITS, and SPI_SS_NB, which set the clock divider length, maximum characters, bits per character, and the number of Slave Select lines, respectively. Control bits such as SPI_CTRL_TXC, SPI_CTRL_SAMPLE, and SPI_CTRL_LSB determine transmission behaviors like transmit on negative edge and LSB first transmission. These configurations are critical for allowing the module to adapt to different SPI modes and requirements, enhancing its versatility in various SPI communication scenarios.",

                    "text": "Module name: SPI_Configurable_Module\n\nModule specification: The SPI_Configurable_Module is designed to facilitate Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication with flexible configuration based on predefined constants. The module's functionality revolves around setting up SPI communication parameters such as clock divider length, maximum character size, number of Slave Select lines, and control options via preprocessor directives. Input and output ports likely include SPI specific signals like SCLK, MOSI, MISO, and SS, though the exact definitions are not provided in the snippet. Internal signals, conjectured from the defines and typical SPI module behavior, might include clk_divider for adjusting the SPI clock frequency, char_length for defining the frame size, and num_ss_lines for selecting among multiple slave devices. The code contains sections primarily for configuring various parameters such as SPI_DIVIDER_LEN, SPI_MAX_CHAR, SPI_CHAR_LEN_BITS, and SPI_SS_NB, which set the clock divider length, maximum characters, bits per character, and the number of Slave Select lines, respectively. Control bits such as SPI_CTRL_TXC, SPI_CTRL_SAMPLE, and SPI_CTRL_LSB determine transmission behaviors like transmit on negative edge and LSB first transmission. These configurations are critical for allowing the module to adapt to different SPI modes and requirements, enhancing its versatility in various SPI communication scenarios."
