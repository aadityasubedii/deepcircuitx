    "spec": "Module name: spi_top.\n\nModule specification: The spi_top module implements a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) which is used to communicate with external devices such as an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) and a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter). The module is synchronized with an input clock (`clk`) and it also responds to a reset signal (`rst`). The `ampDAC` input selects between ADC and DAC modes. Configuration data is loaded through the `data_in` input, with specific signals to load SPI clock divider (`load_div`) and control bits (`load_ctrl`). Output signals include `go` for initiating SPI transactions, `chanA` and `chanB` for ADC data output, and `adcValid` to indicate data validity. Communication with external devices is managed through the outputs `ss_pad_o` (chip select), `sclk_pad_o` (serial clock), `mosi_pad_o` (master out slave in), and an input `miso_pad_i` (master in slave out), along with `conv` to manage ADC conversion.\n\nInternally, the module uses several registers and wires to control its operation. Registers like `divider` and `ctrl` hold SPI configuration values, while `ss` and `Q` are used for chip select and sampling control. The `adcData` wire holds incoming ADC data, and other wires like `rx_negedge` and `tx_negedge` govern data capturing on clock edges. Counters like `Qcount` help manage ADC conversion timing, and signals such as `Write` and `Sample` are derived from control bits to indicate specific operations.\n\nThe module's code defines initialization and update behavior for these internal signals and registers. This is managed through always blocks sensitive to the clock or reset. There are also assignments that define logic levels and signal relationships. The module is broken down into sections for clock and reset handling, signal assignments, and instantiation of sub-modules for clock generation (`spi_clgen`), data transmission (`spi_shift_out`), and data reception (`spi_shift_in`). Each of these sub-modules plays a role in the SPI communication mechanism by generating the correct clock signals, managing data transmission, and handling incoming data reception.",

The module is synchronized with an input clock (`clk`) and it also responds to a reset signal (`rst`). The `ampDAC` input selects between ADC and DAC modes. Configuration data is loaded through the `data_in` input, with specific signals to load SPI clock divider (`load_div`) and control bits (`load_ctrl`). Output signals include `go` for initiating SPI transactions, `chanA` and `chanB` for ADC data output, and `adcValid` to indicate data validity. Communication with external devices is managed through the outputs `ss_pad_o` (chip select), `sclk_pad_o` (serial clock), `mosi_pad_o` (master out slave in), and an input `miso_pad_i` (master in slave out), along with `conv` to manage ADC conversion.\n\nInternally, the module uses several registers and wires to control its operation. Registers like `divider` and `ctrl` hold SPI configuration values, while `ss` and `Q` are used for chip select and sampling control. The `adcData` wire holds incoming ADC data, and other wires like `rx_negedge` and `tx_negedge` govern data capturing on clock edges. Counters like `Qcount` help manage ADC conversion timing, and signals such as `Write` and `Sample` are derived from control bits to indicate specific operations.\n\nThe module's code defines initialization and update behavior for these internal signals and registers. This is managed through always blocks sensitive to the clock or reset. There are also assignments that define logic levels and signal relationships. The module is broken down into sections for clock and reset handling, signal assignments, and instantiation of sub-modules for clock generation (`spi_clgen`), data transmission (`spi_shift_out`), and data reception (`spi_shift_in`). Each of these sub-modules plays a role in the SPI communication mechanism by generating the correct clock signals, managing data transmission, and handling incoming data reception."
