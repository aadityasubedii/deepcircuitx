Module name: adc. Module specification: The 'adc' module represents an analog-to-digital converter interfacing with external ADC hardware that serially outputs the conversion results through the 'sdo' pin. The input ports are 'rst' (a reset that initializes the module), 'conv' (starts the conversion process), 'spi_clk' (external clock for serial communication), and 'clk' (system clock for internal logic operation). The sole output port, 'sdo', carries the serial data output. Internally, the module operates using a memory register 'mem', initialized with a predefined pattern and a width determined by the 'WIDTH' parameter, specifically 14 bits. A 'count' register increments with each 'spi_clk' cycle during the conversion process, and a 'flag' signal is used to indicate when the conversion is active. When 'count' reaches the parameter 'COUNTMAX', the conversion stops, and the pattern in 'mem' is inverted. The code is organized into distinct always blocks: one managing the behavior upon a system clock or reset event that sets or clears the 'flag' and resets 'count' when necessary, another handling 'count' incrementing on negative edges of 'spi_clk', and a third describing the logic that determines the 'sdo' output based on the current 'count' state. The module ensures that 'sdo' presents high impedance when no valid data is being transmitted and outputs the conversion data by sequencing through the bits of 'mem' when within the specified count ranges.
