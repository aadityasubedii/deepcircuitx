The module receives a serial data output (sdo), handles an external clock signal (spi_clk) for serial communication, a system clock (clk), a reset signal (rst), and a conversion start signal (conv). It outputs the conversion results serially through the 'sdo' pin.\n\nThe internal behavior is described as follows:\n\n- It utilizes a 14-bit width for the memory register 'mem', which is initialized with a specific pattern made of alternating 2-bit segments (10).\n- The main control signal 'flag' is used to start the conversion process when the 'conv' signal is received. The conversion process stops when a predetermined count ('COUNTMAX') is reached after which the 'mem' pattern is inverted (~mem).\n- The 'count' register counts the number of clock cycles and is incremented when the 'flag' is set (indicating a conversion is in progress) and the rising edge of the 'spi_clk' is absent (on the negative edge of 'spi_clk').\n- A 7-bit count is maintained to walk through the conversion process, outputting each bit of 'mem' in sequence when the 'count' value is between 3 and 16, inclusive, and then again between 19 and 32, acting as a shift register sending out two frames.\n- The module outputs 'Z' (high impedance) on the 'sdo' line when the count is outside the range of 3-16 and 19-32, and also before the conversion starts, to effectively denote the absence of valid data on the 'sdo' line.\n- The behavior of the module is mostly determined by the clock signals and the state of the 'count' variable, following synchronous design practices apt for clocked digital circuits."

When 'rst' is high, it indicates that the module should reset its internal logic.\n- conv: The conversion start signal input. When 'conv' goes high, it signals the module to start the analog-to-digital conversion process.\n- spi_clk: The serial peripheral interface clock input. This clock is used specifically for the serial communication timing, determining when data bits are sampled and outputted through the 'sdo' line.\n- clk: The system clock input. This clock signal is used to drive the internal state machine and logic of the module, including counting cycles and controlling the timing of operations within the module.\n\nOutput ports: sdo. \nExplanation:\n- sdo: Serial Data Output. This output port sends out the conversion results serially. The data output behavior is controlled internally by the module, outputting bits of the internal memory ('mem') register based on the conversion logic and count. The data is driven to 'Z' (high impedance state) when not actively outputting conversion data, indicating the absence of valid data being transmitted."

It holds the binary pattern used for the analog-to-digital conversion process. Initially, it is loaded with a pattern defined by PATTERN, consisting of alternating 2-bit segments (10).

It is set to 1 when the \u2018conv\u2019 signal is high, initiating the conversion process, and reset to 0 when the count reaches COUNTMAX or on a reset.\n- count: A 7-bit counter used to track the number of clock cycles since the start of a conversion.
