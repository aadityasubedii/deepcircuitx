Module-level comment: The 'adc' module simulates an analog-to-digital converter interfacing with ADC hardware. It outputs data serially from 'sdo', driven by a system clock 'clk' and a serial clock 'spi_clk'. Conversion starts with 'conv' signal and resets via 'rst'. Internally, it uses a 'mem' register to store and output data based on the 'count'. Conversion data is output when 'count' indicates specific intervals and shows high impedance otherwise, managing transitions with 'flag' and inverting 'mem' upon reaching 'COUNTMAX'.
