Module name: spi_top_tb2. 

Module specification: The spi_top_tb2 module is a testbench designed to simulate and verify the functionality of a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) system. It does not have traditional input and output ports, as its primary focus is on internal simulation activities. Key internal signals include clk and rst for clock and reset operations, ampDAC for switching between amplifier and DAC during data transmission, load_div and load_ctrl for controlling the SPI clock divider and control register, data_in representing control or data register inputs, and several data buses such as spi_mosi, amp_miso, dac_miso, and adc_miso for SPI communications. The module is structured into various sections: declarations for parameters and signals, SPI core and peripheral instances like DAC, AMP, and ADC for the test setup, an always block for generating the clock signal, initial blocks for simulation control flow including reset, write, read operations, and an initial block for dumping waveforms. These components work together to apply test vectors, monitor outputs of the SPI system and peripherals, and ensure their correct operation by simulating multiple conditions and scenarios, concluding with waveform output for analysis.
