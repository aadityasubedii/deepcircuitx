The testbench includes instances of SPI core (`spi_top`), Digital-to-Analog Converter (`dac`), amplifier (`amp`), and Analog-to-Digital Converter (`adc`) modules. It sets up various simulation parameters, like clock period and control signals, and manipulates inputs to the SPI system under test. It generates a clock signal, performs reset sequences, configures control registers, and conducts read/write operations to the DAC, AMP, and ADC. The testbench checks for specific conditions using events and waits, then outputs simulation messages, with the events guiding the different phases of the simulation.
