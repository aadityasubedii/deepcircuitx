    "module": "Module-level comment: The `spi_top_tb2` module is a testbench for validating an SPI system, including DAC, AMP, and ADC peripherals. It conducts various test sequences simulating reset, data transfer, and SPI control operations by toggling internal signals, such as clk, rst, and data_in, and monitoring responses through waveforms. Without external ports, the testbench internally instantiates and manages the SPI core and peripheral blocks, ensuring their functionality aligns with specified behaviors."
