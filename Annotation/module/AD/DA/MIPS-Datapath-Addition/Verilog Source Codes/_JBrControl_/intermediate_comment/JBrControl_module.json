    "module": "Module-level comment: The `jBrControl` module computes the next program counter (`outPC`) and controls branch execution via `enable`. It functions by analyzing inputs: program counter (`PC4`), memory output (`memOut`), register value (`reg1`), and jump address (`jmpAddr`), in conjunction with condition flags (`n`, `z`, `v`) and operation flags (`nis0`, `nis1`, `nis2`). A case statement, driven by concatenated `nis` flags (`nis_check`), dictates the selection of the appropriate `outPC` and the status of `enable`, enabling dynamic control flow based on current instruction execution results."
