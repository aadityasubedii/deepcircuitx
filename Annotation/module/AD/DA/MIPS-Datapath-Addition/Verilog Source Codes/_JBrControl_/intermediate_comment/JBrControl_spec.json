    "spec": "Module name: jBrControl. \nModule specification: The `jBrControl` module is responsible for determining the next value of the program counter (`outPC`) and controlling the enablement of this decision through the `enable` signal, based on the evaluation of various operational flags and inputs. It has several inputs: `[31:0] memOut`, a memory output used in conditional branching; `[31:0] PC4`, the incremented program counter used for sequential execution; `[31:0] reg1`, used conditionally as a next PC value; and `[25:0] jmpAddr`, a jump address for branching. Control flags include `nis0, nis1, nis2` determining the operation mode; and condition flags `n, z, v` affecting branch decisions. Outputs include `[31:0] outPC`, the next program counter value, and `enable`, a flag indicating if the branch should be taken. Internal signals consist of `nis_check`, a concatenated signal of the `nis` flags directing the branch logic through a case statement. The module's behavioral logic is structured around a case statement that uses `nis_check` to select among several branching scenarios: directly passing `PC4` in the default case, conditionally selecting values based on the overflow, zero, and negative flags, and assigning corresponding `enable` values to control the branching. This setup allows for dynamic control flow based on the flags and input values during operations.",

It takes as inputs the current program counter plus four (`PC4`), the content from memory (`memOut`), a register value (`reg1`), a jump address (`jmpAddr`), and flags (`nis0`, `nis1`, `nis2`, `n`, `z`, `v`) that influence the decision-making. The operation performed depends on the combination of the `nis0`, `nis1`, and `nis2` flags, which are concatenated into a 3-bit value (`nis_check`). Depending on the value of `nis_check` and the conditions (`n`, `z`, `v`), the module decides whether to jump to a new address, continue to the next instruction, or perform other actions, updating `outPC` and `enable` accordingly."

It is used to form the condition for the case statement that decides the next operation. It effectively determines which set of rules to apply for calculating the next value of the program counter (`outPC`).\n\n- `enable`: Although listed as an output, `enable` can also be considered an internal signal as it is also declared as a `reg` within the module.
