It takes as inputs the current program counter plus four (`PC4`), the content from memory (`memOut`), a register value (`reg1`), a jump address (`jmpAddr`), and flags (`nis0`, `nis1`, `nis2`, `n`, `z`, `v`) that influence the decision-making. The operation performed depends on the combination of the `nis0`, `nis1`, and `nis2` flags, which are concatenated into a 3-bit value (`nis_check`). Depending on the value of `nis_check` and the conditions (`n`, `z`, `v`), the module decides whether to jump to a new address, continue to the next instruction, or perform other actions, updating `outPC` and `enable` accordingly."

It's used as a potential next value for the program counter `outPC` depending on other control signals.\n- `PC4`: A 32-bit input representing the current value of the program counter incremented by 4, which is a common next value for sequential execution.\n- `reg1`: A 32-bit input from a register, used as a potential next program counter value.\n- `jmpAddr`: A 26-bit jump address, used as a potential jump target for branch operations.\n- `nis0`, `nis1`, `nis2`: Control flags (Next Instruction Select) that determine the next instruction's location through a case selection.\n- `n`, `z`, `v`: Condition flags that represent negative, zero, and overflow status of the previous operation, influencing the branching logic.\n\nOutput ports: `[31:0] outPC`, `enable`.\nExplanation:\n- `outPC`: A 32-bit output that represents the next value of the program counter after branching decisions have been made based on the input control signals and flags.\n- `enable`: A 1-bit signal that indicates whether the update of the program counter `outPC` should be enabled or not, based on the branching logic."

It is used to form the condition for the case statement that decides the next operation. It effectively determines which set of rules to apply for calculating the next value of the program counter (`outPC`).\n\n- `enable`: Although listed as an output, `enable` can also be considered an internal signal as it is also declared as a `reg` within the module. It acts as a control signal, indicating whether the update to the program counter should be affected (`enable = 1`) or not (`enable = 0`). It is set depending on the situation described by the case statement.\n\n- `outPC`: This 32-bit register holds the new value of the program counter that is to be used for the next instruction cycle. Its value is determined based on the case statement logic, which takes into account the `nis_check` signal and the conditional flags (`n`, `z`, `v`).
