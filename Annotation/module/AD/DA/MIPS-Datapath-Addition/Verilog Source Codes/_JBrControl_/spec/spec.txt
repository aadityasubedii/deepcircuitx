Module name: jBrControl. 
Module specification: The `jBrControl` module is responsible for determining the next value of the program counter (`outPC`) and controlling the enablement of this decision through the `enable` signal, based on the evaluation of various operational flags and inputs. It has several inputs: `[31:0] memOut`, a memory output used in conditional branching; `[31:0] PC4`, the incremented program counter used for sequential execution; `[31:0] reg1`, used conditionally as a next PC value; and `[25:0] jmpAddr`, a jump address for branching. Control flags include `nis0, nis1, nis2` determining the operation mode; and condition flags `n, z, v` affecting branch decisions. Outputs include `[31:0] outPC`, the next program counter value, and `enable`, a flag indicating if the branch should be taken. Internal signals consist of `nis_check`, a concatenated signal of the `nis` flags directing the branch logic through a case statement. The module's behavioral logic is structured around a case statement that uses `nis_check` to select among several branching scenarios: directly passing `PC4` in the default case, conditionally selecting values based on the overflow, zero, and negative flags, and assigning corresponding `enable` values to control the branching. This setup allows for dynamic control flow based on the flags and input values during operations.
