Module name: processor.
Module specification: The 'processor' module simulates a basic microprocessor architecture in Verilog, intended for use as a test bench for educational or developmental purposes rather than direct hardware implementation. This module lacks traditional input and output ports as it serves as a self-contained simulation environment, instead utilizing internal signal declarations to emulate the processor's functionality. Key internal signals include 'pc' (Program Counter), 'clk' (clock signal), various memory arrays such as 'datmem' (Data Memory) and 'mem' (Instruction Memory), and numerous control and data paths like 'sum' for ALU results and 'instruc' for the current instruction. The module is divided into several primary sections: initializer blocks for loading memory contents and setting initial values, continuous assignments for decoding instructions and handling data flow between components, and always blocks for handling state changes on clock edges and other conditions. Essential operations such as fetching instructions, executing them via an ALU, and handling data storage and retrieval operations are simulated. This design allows for detailed tracing of the processor's state and behavior during simulation, aiding in understanding and debugging processor operations.
