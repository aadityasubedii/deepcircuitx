    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'processor' module is a Verilog test bench that emulates a simple microprocessor's control and data paths without external ports. It executes instructions, manages state with internal signals like 'pc', 'clk', and memory arrays, and simulates ALU operations. The functionality is realized through initial blocks for setup, always blocks for dynamic simulation, and continuous assignments for signal operations."
