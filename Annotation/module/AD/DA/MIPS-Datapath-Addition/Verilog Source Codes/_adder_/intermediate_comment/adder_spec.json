    "spec": "Module name: adder.\nModule specification: The 'adder' module is designed to perform a simple arithmetic operation: the addition of two 32-bit binary numbers. It takes two input ports, 'a' and 'b', which are the 32-bit operands that the module adds together. The result of this addition is presented at the single output port 'out', which is also 32-bits wide to accommodate the sum of the two inputs. The module does not utilize any internal signals or intermediary storage elements, as the operation is straightforward, with the addition being carried out directly within an assign statement. There are no distinct blocks or sections within this module besides the port declarations and the assign statement; it encapsulates only the essential logic needed to implement the 32-bit addition operation, demonstrating a simple combinational logic design with no state retention or sequential logic elements. This simplicity ensures both ease of understanding and efficient performance for the purpose it serves.",
