Module name: alu32.

Module specification: The alu32 module is a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit designed to perform a variety of arithmetic and logical operations. The module takes two 32-bit input operands `a` and `b`, and a 3-bit control signal `gin` which specifies the operation to be performed. The possible operations are addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, and right arithmetic shift. The output of the module is a 32-bit result `sum` and a single-bit zero flag `zout`, which indicates whether `sum` is zero. The internal signals include a 32-bit register `sum` for holding results, a 32-bit register `less` for interim subtraction results, and a single-bit register `zout` for the zero flag. The code uses a case statement to select the operation based on `gin`: addition and subtraction operations update `sum` directly, while the subtraction operation also uses `less` to handle the case where the most significant bit needs to be considered. The AND and OR operations are straightforward binary operations, and the right arithmetic shift operation takes `b` as the shift amount. Lastly, an OR reduction followed by a negation sets the `zout` output flag to indicate a zero result in `sum`. Any undefined `gin` signals result in an undefined `sum`. This module encapsulates core ALU operations crucial for CPU design and execution of instruction sets.
