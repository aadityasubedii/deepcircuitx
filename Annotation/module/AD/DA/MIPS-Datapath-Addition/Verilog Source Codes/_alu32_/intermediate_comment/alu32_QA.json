The operations include addition (`a+b`), subtraction by adding the two's complement (`a+1+(~b)`), setting `sum` based on the most significant bit of `less` when performing subtraction, bitwise AND (`a & b`), bitwise OR (`a | b`), and right arithmetic shift (`a >>> b`). The ALU outputs a `sum` based on the operation specified by `gin` and a zero flag `zout` which is true (`1`) when all bits of `sum` are zero, and false (`0`) otherwise."
