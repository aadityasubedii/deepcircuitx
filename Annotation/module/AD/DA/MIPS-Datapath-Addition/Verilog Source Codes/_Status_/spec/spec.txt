Module name: status. Module specification: The `status` module is designed to interpret data from a 32-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) operation result, denoted as `alu_result`, and generate status flags indicative of that result's characteristics. Specifically, the input port `alu_result` takes in the 32-bit signal from an ALU operation. The module produces three output ports: `n_out`, `z_out`, and `v_out`. The `z_out` flag is set high (1) if `alu_result` is zero, achieved by NOR-ing all the bits of `alu_result`, indicating a zero ALU result. The `n_out` flag represents the most significant bit (MSB) of `alu_result`, signifying if the ALU result is negative when considering two's complement notation. The functionality or calculation for the `v_out` flag is not defined within the provided code snippet. Internally, the module does not utilize any intermediary signals; it directly manipulates the input via continuous assignment statements to produce the output statuses, indicating a minimalistic design optimized for specific status flag generation. The code is structured into clearly defined sections for input/output port declarations and signal assignments corresponding to each output status flag, demonstrating a straightforward and efficient implementation for status flag generation based on ALU operation results.
