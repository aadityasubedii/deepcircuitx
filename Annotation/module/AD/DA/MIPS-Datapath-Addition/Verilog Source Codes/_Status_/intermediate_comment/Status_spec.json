    "spec": "Module name: status. Module specification: The `status` module is designed to interpret data from a 32-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) operation result, denoted as `alu_result`, and generate status flags indicative of that result's characteristics. Specifically, the input port `alu_result` takes in the 32-bit signal from an ALU operation. The module produces three output ports: `n_out`, `z_out`, and `v_out`. The `z_out` flag is set high (1) if `alu_result` is zero, achieved by NOR-ing all the bits of `alu_result`, indicating a zero ALU result. The `n_out` flag represents the most significant bit (MSB) of `alu_result`, signifying if the ALU result is negative when considering two's complement notation. The functionality or calculation for the `v_out` flag is not defined within the provided code snippet. Internally, the module does not utilize any intermediary signals; it directly manipulates the input via continuous assignment statements to produce the output statuses, indicating a minimalistic design optimized for specific status flag generation. The code is structured into clearly defined sections for input/output port declarations and signal assignments corresponding to each output status flag, demonstrating a straightforward and efficient implementation for status flag generation based on ALU operation results.",

The 'z_out' flag is set to high if all bits in 'alu_result' are zero, which is achieved by NOR-ing all the bits together (indicated by the '~(|alu_result)' assignment). The 'n_out' flag is simply the most significant bit of 'alu_result', representing a negative number if set to 1, considering a two's complement representation.
