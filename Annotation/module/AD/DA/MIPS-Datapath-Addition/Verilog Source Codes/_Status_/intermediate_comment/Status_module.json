    "module": "Module-level comment: The `status` module evaluates a 32-bit ALU result via `alu_result` input to generate status flags: `n_out`, `z_out`, `v_out`. It determines if the result is zero (using NOR on all bits for `z_out`) and extracts the most significant bit for `n_out` to check negativity in two's complement. `v_out` functionality is undefined. This implementation efficiently uses direct assignments from the input, without internal signals, streamlining status checks."
