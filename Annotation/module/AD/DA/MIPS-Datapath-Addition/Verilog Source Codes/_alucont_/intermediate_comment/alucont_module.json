    "module": "Module-level comment: The alucont module serves as an ALU Control unit, generating a 3-bit operation code `gout` for the ALU based on input control signals (`aluop1`, `aluop0`) and a function field (`f3`, `f2`, `f1`, `f0`). The internal logic within an `always` block evaluates input combinations, assigning specific codes to `gout` that direct ALU operations. It adapts dynamically to input changes, ensuring correct operation mapping for instruction execution."
