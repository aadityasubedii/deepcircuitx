Module name: mult2_to_1_5. Module specification: The 'mult2_to_1_5' module is a 2-to-1 multiplexer with 5-bit wide inputs and output, designed using Verilog. The primary functionality of this module is to select between two 5-bit inputs 'i0' and 'i1' based on the state of the select signal 's0'. Specifically, if 's0' is high (1), the output 'out' will reflect the value of 'i1'; if 's0' is low (0), 'out' will represent the value of 'i0'. The module defines three inputs: 'i0' and 'i1', which are the 5-bit potential outputs depending on the select signal, and 's0', a single-bit input that determines the selection. The output 'out' is also a 5-bit port that displays the chosen input value. Internally, the module does not use any additional signalsâ€”no registers or wires are employed beyond the inputs and output. The entire functional operation is handled via a straightforward conditional assignment statement that sets 'out' based on the value of 's0' in just a single line of code. This efficient and direct approach encapsulates the core multiplexer function without additional intermediate processing or signal storage.
