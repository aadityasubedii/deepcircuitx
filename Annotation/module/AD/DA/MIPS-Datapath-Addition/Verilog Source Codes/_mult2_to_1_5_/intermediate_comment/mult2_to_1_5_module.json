    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mult2_to_1_5' module implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer with 5-bit inputs ('i0', 'i1') and output ('out'), selecting 'i1' or 'i0' based on the select signal 's0'. Functionality is achieved through a conditional assignment, directly mapping 's0' to the output choice in a concise manner without internal signals."
