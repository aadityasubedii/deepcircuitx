Explanation: `shout` is a 32-bit output port that presents the data after the left shift operation.

Thus, the operation is performed without intermediate storage or processing stages within the module itself.\n\nInternal signals: None. Explanation: The module performs a direct assignment from the input `shin` to the output `shout` using a left shift operation (`<<2`), without any internal signals for intermediate data manipulation or storage. The module's simplicity means that all processing is directly between the input and the output, negating the need for internal signals."
