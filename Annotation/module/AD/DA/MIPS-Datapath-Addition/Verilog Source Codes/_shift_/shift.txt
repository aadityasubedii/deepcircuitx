Module-level comment: The 'shift' module performs a 2-bit left shift on a 32-bit input ('shin'), multiplexing it by 4. This is achieved through direct bit manipulation with a combinational logic statement that assigns the shifted result to the 32-bit output ('shout') without using any internal signals.
