Module name: shift. Module specification: The 'shift' module is designed to perform a left-bit shifting operation specifically doubling the magnitude of a 32-bit input, `shin`, by shifting it left by two positions, effectively multiplying the input by 4. This operation transforms the input data `shin`, which is provided through a 32-bit input port, to a 32-bit output port `shout`. The output `shout` is used to expose the shifted result, making it accessible to other modules or external circuits. The module employs a very straightforward logic where the output `shout` is directly assigned the value of the input `shin` shifted left by two bits (`shin << 2`), without any intermediate processing or internal signals. The simplicity of the code is evident as it contains only the essential input-output definitions and the direct assignment operation, efficiently handling the task with minimal structural complexity.
