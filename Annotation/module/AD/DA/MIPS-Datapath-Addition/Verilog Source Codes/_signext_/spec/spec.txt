Module name: signext. Module specification: The `signext` module is designed to perform sign extension on a 16-bit input signal, transitioning it to a fully-fledged 32-bit output signal while preserving the sign. Central to the module's operation are its input and output ports: `in1` and `out1`, respectively. The `in1` port is a 16-bit wide signal representing the data intended for sign extension. Conversely, the `out1` port emanates as a 32-bit wide signal, encapsulating the outcome of the sign extension process, characterized by replicating the sign bit (the most significant bit of `in1`) 16 times and subsequently concatenating these with the original 16 bits of `in1` to cultivate a comprehensive 32-bit signed output. This operation is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the sign in scenarios demanding a 16 to 32-bit data type transition.

Notably, the `signext` module is devoid of any internal signals, underscoring a streamlined design that leverages direct assignment to facilitate the sign extension procedure. The Verilog code reveals a singular, decisive operation devoid of internal intermediaries, where the assignment `out1 = {{16{in1[15]}}, in1};` is prominently executed. This line of code succinctly encapsulates the module's functionality, leveraging Verilog's bit manipulation capabilities to achieve the sign extension efficiently. Through this operation, the module directly influences the input `in1` to yield `out1` without recourse to auxiliary signals or elaborate internal workflows, marking a straightforward yet effective sign extension mechanism.
