It replicates the sign bit (most significant bit) of the input 16 times and then concatenates this with the original 16 bits of input to form a 32-bit signed output. This is useful in scenarios where you need to convert a smaller datatype to a larger datatype while preserving the sign (positive or negative) of the numerical value."

Explanation: The input port 'in1' is a 16-bit wide signal that represents the data to be sign-extended. It essentially provides the raw value which is to be processed by the sign extension logic within the module.\n\nOutput ports: [out1]. Explanation: The output port 'out1' is a 32-bit wide signal that holds the result of the sign extension operation. This port outputs the processed value where the sign bit of 'in1' has been replicated 16 times and concatenated with the original 16 bits to form a full 32-bit signed value. This is crucial for operations where the 16-bit data needs to be appropriately conditioned for a 32-bit processing environment, ensuring correct sign representation."
