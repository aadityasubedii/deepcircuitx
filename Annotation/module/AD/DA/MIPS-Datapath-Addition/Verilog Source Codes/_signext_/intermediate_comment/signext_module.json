    "module": "Module-level comment: The `signext` module performs sign extension from a 16-bit input (`in1`) to a 32-bit output (`out1`), efficiently preserving the sign through bit manipulation. By utilizing a direct assignment that replicates `in1`'s most significant bit (sign bit) 16 times and concatenates it with `in1`, this operation ensures accurate sign preservation for a widened data type, encapsulating the process in a simple, yet effective implementation."
