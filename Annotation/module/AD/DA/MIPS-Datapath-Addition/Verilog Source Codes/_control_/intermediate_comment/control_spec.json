These outputs dictate actions for the CPU, like choosing the destination register, selecting ALU operands, managing memory access, and configuring branching behavior. Internally, the module distinguishes between different instruction types via flags like `rformat`, `lw`, `sw`, and `beq`, which point to R-format, load word, store word, and branch if equal instructions, respectively.

It interprets the input instruction (represented by the 'in' and 'func' signals) to control various parts of the CPU. The module decodes the opcode ('in') and the function field (for R-format instructions) to generate control signals for different CPU operations. These control signals include 'regdest' (register destination select), 'alusrc' (ALU source), 'memtoreg' (memory to register load), 'regwrite' (register write control), 'memread' and 'memwrite' (memory read and write controls), 'branch' (branch control), 'aluop1' and 'aluop2' (ALU operation controls), and 'nis0', 'nis1', and 'nis2' (additional control signals).\n\nThe module uses a set of internal wires like 'rformat', 'lw', 'sw', 'beq', etc., that correspond to specific types of instructions (e.g., R-format, load word, store word, branch equal, etc.), and each wire is assigned based on the pattern of bits in the input instruction. These internal signals are then used to derive the output control signals that manage the instruction execution flow within the CPU architecture."

When set, the ALU's second operand is an immediate value or an offset from the instruction itself; otherwise, it comes from a register.\n- `memtoreg`: Controls whether the ALU result or data read from memory is to be written into the register file, effectively choosing between computational and load operations' outputs as the source of write-back data.\n- `regwrite`: Enables writing to the register file, allowing the result of a computation or a data load operation to be saved in a register.\n- `memread`: Enables reading from memory, used in load operations to fetch data from the memory to a register.\n- `memwrite`: Enables writing to memory, used in store operations to save data from a register to a memory address.\n- `branch`: Indicates whether the current instruction is a conditional branch instruction, controlling whether the next instruction address is calculated based on the branch target or advances sequentially.\n- `aluop1` and `aluop2`: Control signals for configuring the ALU operation, indicating to the ALU what kind of operation to perform based on the current instruction type.\n- `nis0`, `nis1`, `nis2`: Additional control signals that might be used for extended or specific CPU operations, providing flexibility for custom or specialized behaviors not covered by the standard signals."
