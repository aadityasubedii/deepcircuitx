Module-level comment: The 'control' module interprets a 6-bit opcode (`in`) and function code (`func`) to generate CPU control signals based on instruction types. Using internal signals like `rformat`, `lw`, and `beq` to detect instruction formats, it assigns output signals (`regdest`, `alusrc`, etc.) that control CPU operations. This setup ensures flexible instruction handling within the processor's control unit, orchestrating operations from ALU commands to memory management effectively.
