A half adder is used to add two single binary digits (bits) together, producing a sum and a carry bit as outputs. The 'a' and 'b' are the two inputs representing the bits to be added, 's' is the sum output, and 'c' is the carry output. The XOR gate (U1) is used to calculate the sum, while the AND gate (U2) is used to determine the carry. The XOR gate outputs '1' if the number of '1's at its inputs is odd, giving the correct sum, and the AND gate outputs '1' only when both inputs 'a' and 'b' are '1', indicating a carry is needed."
