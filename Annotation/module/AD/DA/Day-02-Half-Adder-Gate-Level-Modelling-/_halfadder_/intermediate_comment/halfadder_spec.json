    "spec": "Module name: halfadder. Module specification: The halfadder module represents a simple combinational logic circuit designed to add two single binary digits, with the added functionality of calculating both the sum and the carry of the input bits. It features two input ports: 'a' and 'b', which accept the binary digits to be added. The output ports consist of 's' for the sum, and 'c' for the carry. The sum 's' is obtained from the XOR gate (U1) which yields '1' when an odd number of its inputs (a and b) are '1'. The carry output 'c' is produced by the AND gate (U2), where a '1' is output only when both 'a' and 'b' are '1', indicating that a carry must be generated. Internally, the identifiers U1 and U2 denote instances of XOR and AND gates, respectively, and they are not signals or variables but references to these instantiated modules. The Verilog code is organized into a module declaration including input and output ports, followed by the instantiations of the XOR and AND gates for the sum and carry calculations, concluding with the endmodule keyword, which delineates the end of the halfadder module. This module does not contain any internal wires or registers, but directly connects the inputs to the outputs through the instantiated gates, demonstrating a straightforward example of structural Verilog coding that realizes the half adder logic.",
