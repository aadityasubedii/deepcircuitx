Module name: halfadder_tb.

Module specification: The halfadder_tb is a testbench module designed for verifying the functionality of a half adder circuit, which performs the addition of two single-bit binary numbers. The inputs to this testbench module are `a` and `b`, which represent the two bits to be added by the half adder circuit. The outputs monitored by the testbench are `s` for the sum and `c` for the carry, which are driven by the instantiated halfadder module (U1) in the testbench. Internally, the module initializes `a` and `b` with a set of simulated input combinations (00, 01, 10, 11), applied at intervals of 45 time units, to test the resulting `s` and `c` outputs from U1. The objective is to ensure that U1 behaves as expected by producing accurate values of sum and carry for each set of inputs. The testbench contains an `initial` block that sequentially assigns the values to `a` and `b`, demonstrating a crucial aspect of the testbench to sequentially simulate different inputs over time, without any need for internal signal processing beyond value assignment and timing control. This test specification accurately encapsulates the purpose and operation of the halfadder_tb module.
