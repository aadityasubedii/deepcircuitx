Module-level comment: The halfadder_tb module serves as a testbench for verifying a half adder's functionality, which adds two single-bit inputs to produce a sum and a carry. It systematically simulates input combinations (00, 01, 10, 11) on inputs `a` and `b` with a 45 time unit interval, utilizing the halfadder module (U1) to observe the outputs `s` (sum) and `c` (carry). This setup ensures that the half adder operates correctly across all binary input cases.
