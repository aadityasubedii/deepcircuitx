    "spec": "Module name: seven_segment_LED. \n\nModule specification: The 'seven_segment_LED' module is responsible for driving a six-digit seven-segment LED display to show a fixed number, 123456. This module processes the inputs 'rst_n' (an active-low reset signal) and 'clk' (a clock signal) to produce a 42-bit output 'segs'. The 'segs' signal contains the encoded representation for each of the six digits with every 7 bits corresponding to a single digit on the display, with 'segs[41:35]' representing the most significant digit and 'segs[6:0]' the least significant. Internally, the module uses a 20-bit register 'lnum' to hold the constant value of the number to be displayed (123456) and a parameter 'ctable' functioning as a look-up table that maps decimal digits to their corresponding 7-segment LED patterns. Encoded segment patterns are updated at every positive edge of the clock signal ensuring the display reflects the fixed number unless the module is in reset state, in which case the 'segs' output is cleared to 0, turning off all segments. The module's main code block uses arithmetic operations on 'lnum' to extract each digit and accesses the corresponding pattern from 'ctable' using indexed part-selects to set the appropriate segments in the 'segs' output.",

It encodes the fixed number 123456 into segments that would be lit on the LED display according to a predefined coding table (`ctable`). The `ctable` maps each digit to its corresponding 7-segment LED representation, which has been stored as 8-bit entries for simplicity despite only using 7 bits. If the reset signal is low (active low), all segments are turned off. Otherwise, on each positive edge of the clock, the segments for each digit are updated based on the `ctable` mapping and the given static number (`num`). Each group of 7 bits in the `segs` output represents one digit of the seven-segment display, ordered from the most significant digit to the least significant digit (`segs[41:35]` to `segs[6:0]`). The operation for dividing and taking the modulus of `lnum` by powers of 10 effectively extracts each digit of the fixed number, which is then used to index into the coding table to determine the segment activation for that particular digit."

The `clk` input is a clock signal that drives the timing of the module's operation, specifically, it triggers the update of the output `segs` on each rising edge if the reset signal is not active.\n\nOutput ports: segs. \nExplanation: The `segs` output is a 42-bit register representing the state of each segment across 6 seven-segment LEDs, with each set of 7 bits encoding the segments to be illuminated for displaying a digit from the fixed number 123456. Each group of 7 bits corresponds to one digit of the seven-segment display, from the most significant digit (MSD) at `segs[41:35]` to the least significant digit (LSD) at `segs[6:0]`.

In the given code, `lnum` is assigned the value of `num` each time a positive edge of the clock is detected. However, this is redundant since `num` is a fixed parameter and `lnum` is not modified elsewhere in the code. It acts as a placeholder for the value intended to be displayed on the seven-segment LED, which is 123456 in this case.\n\n- `ctable` is an internal parameter that serves as a look-up table for converting a decimal digit (0-9) into the corresponding 7-segment LED display pattern. Each 8-bit entry of `ctable` represents the pattern for one digit, with bits corresponding to the segments \"abcdefg\" (from MSB to LSB) that should be illuminated to represent that digit. The eighth bit is unused since only 7 bits are needed to represent all the segments of a 7-segment LED display. This look-up table is essential for mapping the individual digits extracted from `lnum` to the output patterns that need to be driven on the `segs` output to physically display the number on the LED modules."
