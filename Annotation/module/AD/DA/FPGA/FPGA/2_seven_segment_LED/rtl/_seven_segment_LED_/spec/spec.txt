Module name: seven_segment_LED. 

Module specification: The 'seven_segment_LED' module is responsible for driving a six-digit seven-segment LED display to show a fixed number, 123456. This module processes the inputs 'rst_n' (an active-low reset signal) and 'clk' (a clock signal) to produce a 42-bit output 'segs'. The 'segs' signal contains the encoded representation for each of the six digits with every 7 bits corresponding to a single digit on the display, with 'segs[41:35]' representing the most significant digit and 'segs[6:0]' the least significant. Internally, the module uses a 20-bit register 'lnum' to hold the constant value of the number to be displayed (123456) and a parameter 'ctable' functioning as a look-up table that maps decimal digits to their corresponding 7-segment LED patterns. Encoded segment patterns are updated at every positive edge of the clock signal ensuring the display reflects the fixed number unless the module is in reset state, in which case the 'segs' output is cleared to 0, turning off all segments. The module's main code block uses arithmetic operations on 'lnum' to extract each digit and accesses the corresponding pattern from 'ctable' using indexed part-selects to set the appropriate segments in the 'segs' output.
