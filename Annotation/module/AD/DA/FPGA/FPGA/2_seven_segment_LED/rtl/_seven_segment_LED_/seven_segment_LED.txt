Module-level comment: The 'seven_segment_LED' module encodes the fixed number 123456 for display on a 6-digit seven-segment LED, using 'rst_n' (active-low reset) and 'clk' signals. It leverages an internal look-up table 'ctable' within the main always block, updated on each clock's rising edge, to map each digit to its 7-segment pattern. On reset, all segments are turned off.
