    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_tb` module is a testbench for the SDRAM controller, simulating a 50 MHz clock (`clock_50m`) and active-low reset (`rst_n`) to drive the `sdram_rw_test` and `sdr` modules. It handles generating timing signals and interfacing with the SDRAM, managing inputs (clock and reset) and outputs (SDRAM control signals and status LED) to validate the functionality and behavior of SDRAM operations in a controlled environment."
