Module name: SDRAM_Controller.

Module specification:
The `SDRAM_Controller` is a Verilog module designed to interface with synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM). It is responsible for initializing the memory, as well as handling read and write operations through a sequence of commands represented by defined operation codes (e.g., `I_NOP`, `I_PRE`, `I_AR`, etc.). The module operates with a variety of input and output ports including `clk`, `rst`, `cmd`, `addr`, and `data_in` for inputs, as well as `data_out` and `busy` for outputs. The `clk` serves as the timing pulse for operation execution, `rst` acts as a reset signal, `cmd` provides operation commands, `addr` specifies memory addresses, and `data_in` is the data to be written. The outputs `data_out` and `busy` respectively offer the data read from the memory and a flag indicating whether the module is ready for new commands. Internal signals such as `state`, `cnt_clk`, and various operation-specific counters such as `sdram_rd_burst` and `sdram_wr_burst` are utilized to manage the state machine's operation and timing of the memory interactions. The code is divided into sections corresponding to operation code definitions, state machine state definitions, end condition checks for various timing parameters, and command signal definitions, each crucial for driving the correct behavior in communication with the SDRAM.
