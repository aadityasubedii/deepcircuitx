Module name: sdr. Module specification: The sdr module is a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) controller that implements the functionality of an SDRAM chip. It handles memory operations including activate, read, write, precharge, and refresh commands, while managing multiple memory banks, address decoding, and adhering to SDRAM timing specifications. The module has input ports for clock (Clk), control signals (Cke, Cs_n, Ras_n, Cas_n, We_n), addressing (Addr, Ba), and data masking (Dqm). It uses a bidirectional data bus (Dq) for read and write operations. Internally, the module utilizes various signals and registers to manage bank states, row and column addresses, command pipelines, and timing checks. Key internal components include memory bank arrays, address and command registers, state flags for bank activation an
