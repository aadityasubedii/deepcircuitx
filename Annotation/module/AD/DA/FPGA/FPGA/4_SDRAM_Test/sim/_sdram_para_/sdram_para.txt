Module-level comment: The `SDRAM_Controller` module interfaces with SDRAM, handling initialization, read, and write operations through a state machine and timing-based commands. It uses input signals (`clk`, `rst`, `cmd`, `addr`, `data_in`) to manage operations and outputs (`data_out`, `busy`) to convey status and data. Internals like `state`, `cnt_clk`, and burst counters orchestrate command sequencing and timing fulfillment for SDRAM protocol adherence.
