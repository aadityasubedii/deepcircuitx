    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements an SDRAM controller, managing read/write operations, address decoding, and timing for multiple memory banks. It processes SDRAM commands (activate, read, write, precharge, refresh), handles burst operations and auto-precharge, and adheres to timing specifications. The module uses internal registers and state machines to track bank status, address information, and command pipelines, ensuring proper SDRAM operation and timing requirements are met."
