Module name: sdram_tb. 

Module specification: The `sdram_tb` module serves as a comprehensive testbench designed for verifying the functionality of an SDRAM controller, likely encapsulated within another module referred to as `sdram_rw_test`. Primarily, this module's functionality includes generating a 50 MHz clock signal (`clock_50m`) and an active-low reset signal (`rst_n`), which are crucial for simulating the test environment's synchronous behavior. Additionally, this testbench manages various output signals vital for SDRAM operation, such as `sdram_clk` (SDRAM clock signal), `sdram_cke` (clock enable), `sdram_cs_n` (chip select, active low), `sdram_ras_n` (row address strobe, active low), `sdram_cas_n` (column address strobe, active low), `sdram_we_n` (write enable, active low), `sdram_ba` (2-bit bank address), `sdram_addr` (13-bit address signal), `sdram_data` (16-bit bidirectional data bus), `sdram_dqm` (2-bit data mask signal), and `led` (indicative status LED output). These signals facilitate the interfacing with and control over the simulated SDRAM device, represented by the `sdr` sub-module, while also indicating the status of the test sequence. The module's internals primarily consist of the `sdram_rw_test` instantiation, responsible for driving the control and data interfaces of the SDRAM, and the `sdr` instantiation, simulating the SDRAM device itself. The Verilog code segments are structured into initialization sequences for simulating the starting conditions, clock signal generation to mimic the test environment's timing characteristics, and module instantiations that form the core of the testbench's functionality. This structured approach enables the effective simulation and validation of SDRAM operations within a controlled test environment.
