    "module": "Module-level comment: The SRAM module acts as an interface controller for SDRAM, managing initialization, clock generation, data read/write, and LED status indication. It uses input clocks (`clk`, `rst_n`) and outputs like `sdram_clk`, `sdram_cas_n`, among others for command signaling. Internally, it features `pll_clk` for clock management, `sdram_test` for operational testing, `led_disp` for error indication, and `sdram_top` for direct SDRAM interfacing, ensuring efficient and reliable memory operations."
