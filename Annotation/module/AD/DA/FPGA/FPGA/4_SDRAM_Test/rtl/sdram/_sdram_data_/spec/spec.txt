Module name: sdram_data.
Module specification: The 'sdram_data' module is tailored for interfacing with SDRAM to facilitate both read and write operations based on the input states. It accommodates multiple input signals including 'clk' (a clock signal for synchronization), 'rst_n' (an active-low reset for initialization), 'sdram_data_in' (a 16-bit input data bus for data intended for SDRAM), 'work_state' (a 4-bit signal dictating the current SDRAM operation), and 'cnt_clk' (a 10-bit signal likely used for wider operational timing, not directly involved in this module). The module outputs data through 'sdram_data_out', a 16-bit output data bus that carries data retrieved from the SDRAM. The 'sdram_data' is a 16-bit bidirectional bus managed by internal logic to either drive or receive data based on the operation mode commanded through 'sdram_out_en'. Internal registers 'sdram_out_en', 'sdram_din_r', and 'sdram_dout_r' are employed to manage the read/write operations, and the direction of the data flow. The implementation includes separate always blocks: one controlling the enable signal 'sdram_out_en' to direct data flow, another always block capturing data to be written to the SDRAM into 'sdram_din_r', and a final block for reading data from SDRAM into 'sdram_dout_r'. These blocks function synchronously with the clock and asynchronously reset upon a low signal on 'rst_n', ensuring data integrity and proper flow control between the controller and SDRAM.
