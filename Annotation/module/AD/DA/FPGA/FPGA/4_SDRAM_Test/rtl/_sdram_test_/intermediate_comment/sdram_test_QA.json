The module writes sequential data to the SDRAM after it is initialized, then reads the data back to verify correctness. If the read data does not match the expected data, an error flag is set. The module handles initialization, data writing, reading, and error checking, controlled by a 50 MHz clock and a reset signal."

When asserted (low), it initializes or resets the internal states and counters of the module to their default settings.\n- rd_data: This input port receives the data read from the SDRAM. It is used to verify against the expected data written earlier.\n- sdram_init_done: This signal indicates whether the SDRAM initialization is complete. The module starts its write operations only after this signal is asserted.\n\nOutput ports: wr_en, wr_data, rd_en, error_flag. \nExplanation: \n- wr_en: Write enable signal for writing to the SDRAM. It is asserted (high) when the module is enabled to write data.\n- wr_data: This is the actual data being sent to the SDRAM for writing. It consists of sequential values set by the module.\n- rd_en: Read enable signal for reading data from the SDRAM. It is asserted (high) when the module is enabled to read data.\n- error_flag: This flag is used as an indicator of data mismatch. If the data read from SDRAM does not match the expected data, this flag is set high indicating an error."

It is used to capture the state of SDRAM initialization completion from the previous clock cycle, providing a synchronous update mechanism within the state machine.\n- init_done_d1: This signal delays 'init_done_d0' by one additional clock cycle. It is employed to ensure that all conditions pertaining to SDRAM initialization have been stably met before proceeding with write operations.\n- wr_cnt: Write counter that keeps track of the number of writes executed to the SDRAM. It is incremented with each write operation when SDRAM initialization is complete, and resets on a system reset. This counter helps in controlling the sequence and the quantity of write operations.\n- rd_cnt: Read counter used to track the number of read operations from the SDRAM. It increments similarly to 'wr_cnt', but is controlled by the read enable signal ('rd_en') and is used to ensure all write operations are read back for verification.\n- rd_valid: This signal is a flag set high when the read count reaches its maximum specified limit, indicating that all data has been read and thus enabling the error checking phase. It ensures that error checking is initiated only after all expected data has been read back from the SDRAM."
