Module-level comment: The 'sdram_test' module tests SDRAM functionality by performing sequential write and read operations post-initialization. Using a 50 MHz clock and an active low reset, it handles the synchronization of initialization, triggers writes, confirms reads, and checks for data integrity. It employs internal counters and state signals to manage and verify each step, ensuring accurate documentation of operation status via the error flag. This organization ensures robust SDRAM data handling and error monitoring.
