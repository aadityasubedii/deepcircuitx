It handles the logic for initializing the SDRAM, selecting operation modes, and choosing the right commands such as NOP (No Operation), ACTIVE, READ, WRITE, etc., based on the current SDRAM's state and requested operation. The module dynamically sets the SDRAM bank address and address signals according to the provided addresses and manages the commands during read or write bursts and precharge sequences. This is essential for interfacing with an SDRAM in digital systems, ensuring proper timing and control sequences are met for reliable memory operations."

The value stored in this register directly controls the SDRAM control signals (`sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`) through a simple bitwise assignment.\n\n- `sys_addr`: This wire signal is used to select between `sys_wraddr` and `sys_rdaddr` based on the current operation. If a read operation is being executed (`sdram_rd_wr` is 1), `sys_rdaddr` is used; otherwise, for a write operation, `sys_wraddr` is selected.
