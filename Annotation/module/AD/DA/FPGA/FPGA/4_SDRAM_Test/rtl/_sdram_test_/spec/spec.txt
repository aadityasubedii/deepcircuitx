Module name: sdram_test.
Module specification:
The 'sdram_test' module validates SDRAM functionality by executing write and read operations post initialization. Operating with a 50 MHz clock, this module accepts a reset signal (active low), data read from SDRAM ('rd_data'), and a completion signal of SDRAM initialization ('sdram_init_done'). It outputs write and read enable signals ('wr_en', 'rd_en'), write data ('wr_data'), and an error flag ('error_flag'). The 'wr_en' signal triggers the SDRAM to accept data, conveyed by 'wr_data' as sequential values. The 'rd_en' signal commences data read-back, which is compared against expected values to set 'error_flag' upon discrepancies. Inside, delayed versions of the SDRAM initialization completion flag ('init_done_d0', 'init_done_d1') help synchronize the start of operations. Write ('wr_cnt') and read ('rd_cnt') counters monitor the progress of memory transactions. The internal signal 'rd_valid' asserts post all reads, permitting error verification. The code is partitioned into blocks handling signal initialization, write counter progression, data writing, read enablement, read counter progression, read validation, and error checking. Each block operates synchronously to the clock or asynchronously to a reset event. The design ensures a robust workflow where only when initialization is confirmed and data is written, it's read back and validated, thereby ensuring SDRAM integrity.
