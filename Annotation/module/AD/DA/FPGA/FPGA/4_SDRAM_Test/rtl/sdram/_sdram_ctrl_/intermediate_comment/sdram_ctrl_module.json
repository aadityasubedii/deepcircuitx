    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_ctrl` module interfaces with SDRAM to manage initialization, read/write operations, and refresh cycles based on SDRAM timing specs. It uses state machines for managing stages of SDRAM control, with internal counters and signals to enforce precise timing, address request handling, and maintain an operational state reflecting SDRAM status."
