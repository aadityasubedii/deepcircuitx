Module name: pll_clk. 

Module specification: The 'pll_clk' module configures and instantiates a phase-locked loop (PLL) using the 'altpll_component' to generate stable clock signals at various frequencies and phase alignments from a single input clock ('inclk0'). Inputs include 'areset', an asynchronous reset signal used to reset the PLL configuration, and 'inclk0', the primary input clock signal. Output ports are 'c0', 'c1', and 'c2', each providing a configurable clock signal with distinct frequencies and phases, in addition to 'locked', a signal indicating if the PLL is successfully locked onto the input clock. Internal signals such as 'sub_wire0' to 'sub_wire7' handle different functionalities: 'sub_wire0' distributes generated clock signals; 'sub_wire1' through 'sub_wire4' extract specific PLL-generated clocks; 'sub_wire2' carries the lock status; and 'sub_wire5' to 'sub_wire7' organize clock inputs for the altpll_component. The 'altpll' instantiation manages the actual PLL operation, with multiple parametrizations set through 'defparam' to finely control the PLL characteristics and behaviors, such as frequency multiplication/division, duty cycle, and phase shift. The module's design ensures the synchronization of clocks across different component portions of an FPGA-based system, crucial for digital signal processing and system timing operations.
