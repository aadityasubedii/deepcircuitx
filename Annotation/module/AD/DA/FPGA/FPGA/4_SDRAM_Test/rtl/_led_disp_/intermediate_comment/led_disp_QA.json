Its functionality is governed by a system clock (clk_50m) and a reset signal (rst_n). When the reset is active low, it initializes an internal counter (led_cnt) and the LED output to their respective default states, which are '0' and off (0), respectively. The module counts up to 25,000,000 using the internal counter, and every time this count is reached, the LED toggles its state (on to off, or off to on) if the error_flag input is true. If the error_flag is not set, the LED remains constantly on, indicating no error condition. This offers a visual means to monitor the presence of an error condition or check the system's operational status through the LED's behavior."

It drives the timing of the internal processes and sequential logic of the module, including counter increments and LED toggling.\n- rst_n: This is the negative-active reset signal. When this signal is low, it initializes the internal counter and the LED output to their default states.\n- error_flag: This is an input signal that indicates the presence of an error.

It plays a crucial role in determining when to toggle the LED's state. The counter increments with each positive edge of the 50 MHz clock (clk_50m) and resets to 0 when either the rst_n signal is low or when the count reaches 25,000,000. The comparison of led_cnt with the value 25,000,000 helps in creating a timing reference for toggling the LED to indicate an error condition when the error_flag is set. This creates a blinking LED effect that continues as long as the error_flag remains high. When the error_flag is not set, the led_cnt's value does not influence the LED, as it remains constantly on, signifying no error."
