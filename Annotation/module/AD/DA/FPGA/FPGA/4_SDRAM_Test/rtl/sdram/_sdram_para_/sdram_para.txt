Module-level comment: The SDRAM_Controller_Module orchestrates SDRAM operations through state machine logic and timing control. It defines instruction codes for command execution, states for operational flow, and command codes mirroring SDRAM protocol. Timers and conditions ensure precise adherence to required delays between memory accesses, maintaining protocol accuracy and efficiency.
