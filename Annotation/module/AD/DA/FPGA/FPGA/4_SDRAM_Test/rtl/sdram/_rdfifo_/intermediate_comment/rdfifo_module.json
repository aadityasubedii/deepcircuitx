    "module": "Module-level comment: The `rdfifo` module serves as a dual-clock FIFO buffer, facilitating data buffering between two asynchronous clock domains. It utilizes internal wires `sub_wire0` and `sub_wire1` to connect `dcfifo_component` outputs to module ports, supporting 16-bit data transfers. Configured primarily for performance on Cyclone II FPGAs, it handles FIFO operations with configurable parameters for size, speed, and error checking, ensuring efficient and reliable data management."
