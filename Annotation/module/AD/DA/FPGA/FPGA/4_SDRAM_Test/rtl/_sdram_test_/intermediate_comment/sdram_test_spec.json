    "spec": "Module name: sdram_test.\nModule specification:\nThe 'sdram_test' module validates SDRAM functionality by executing write and read operations post initialization. Operating with a 50 MHz clock, this module accepts a reset signal (active low), data read from SDRAM ('rd_data'), and a completion signal of SDRAM initialization ('sdram_init_done'). It outputs write and read enable signals ('wr_en', 'rd_en'), write data ('wr_data'), and an error flag ('error_flag'). The 'wr_en' signal triggers the SDRAM to accept data, conveyed by 'wr_data' as sequential values. The 'rd_en' signal commences data read-back, which is compared against expected values to set 'error_flag' upon discrepancies. Inside, delayed versions of the SDRAM initialization completion flag ('init_done_d0', 'init_done_d1') help synchronize the start of operations. Write ('wr_cnt') and read ('rd_cnt') counters monitor the progress of memory transactions. The internal signal 'rd_valid' asserts post all reads, permitting error verification. The code is partitioned into blocks handling signal initialization, write counter progression, data writing, read enablement, read counter progression, read validation, and error checking. Each block operates synchronously to the clock or asynchronously to a reset event. The design ensures a robust workflow where only when initialization is confirmed and data is written, it's read back and validated, thereby ensuring SDRAM integrity.",

When asserted (low), it initializes or resets the internal states and counters of the module to their default settings.\n- rd_data: This input port receives the data read from the SDRAM. It is used to verify against the expected data written earlier.\n- sdram_init_done: This signal indicates whether the SDRAM initialization is complete. The module starts its write operations only after this signal is asserted.\n\nOutput ports: wr_en, wr_data, rd_en, error_flag. \nExplanation: \n- wr_en: Write enable signal for writing to the SDRAM. It is asserted (high) when the module is enabled to write data.\n- wr_data: This is the actual data being sent to the SDRAM for writing. It consists of sequential values set by the module.\n- rd_en: Read enable signal for reading data from the SDRAM. It is asserted (high) when the module is enabled to read data.\n- error_flag: This flag is used as an indicator of data mismatch.

It is used to capture the state of SDRAM initialization completion from the previous clock cycle, providing a synchronous update mechanism within the state machine.\n- init_done_d1: This signal delays 'init_done_d0' by one additional clock cycle. It is employed to ensure that all conditions pertaining to SDRAM initialization have been stably met before proceeding with write operations.\n- wr_cnt: Write counter that keeps track of the number of writes executed to the SDRAM. It is incremented with each write operation when SDRAM initialization is complete, and resets on a system reset. This counter helps in controlling the sequence and the quantity of write operations.\n- rd_cnt: Read counter used to track the number of read operations from the SDRAM. It increments similarly to 'wr_cnt', but is controlled by the read enable signal ('rd_en') and is used to ensure all write operations are read back for verification.\n- rd_valid: This signal is a flag set high when the read count reaches its maximum specified limit, indicating that all data has been read and thus enabling the error checking phase. It ensures that error checking is initiated only after all expected data has been read back from the SDRAM."
