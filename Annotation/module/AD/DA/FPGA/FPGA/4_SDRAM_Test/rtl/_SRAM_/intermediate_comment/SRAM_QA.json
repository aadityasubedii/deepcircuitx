It uses multiple internal modules to handle operations such as clock generation (using `pll_clk`), running SDRAM tests (`sdram_test`), handling LED indications (`led_disp`), and managing data writing and reading from SDRAM via the `sdram_top` module. The module interacts with the SDRAM to perform initialization, writing, reading, and managing SDRAM operational states such as active, refresh, and power down through specified control signals and data buses. The module is also equipped to generate necessary clock signals and handle system resets ensuring the SDRAM operates under correct timing and system conditions."

It is used to drive certain parts of the internal logic and modules that require this specific clock rate.\n- `clk_100m`: This is another clock signal generated by the PLL, operating at 100 MHz. It is used where a higher clock frequency is necessary for operations, particularly in managing the SDRAM.\n- `clk_100m_shift`: This is a phase-shifted version of the 100 MHz clock.

It is the output data retrieved as a result of a read operation initiated by `rd_en`.\n- `sdram_init_done`: This signal indicates whether the initialization process of the SDRAM has been completed. It's used to ensure that no read/write operations are attempted before the SDRAM is ready.\n- `locked`: This signal comes from the PLL and indicates that the PLL has locked onto the input clock and is generating stable output frequencies. It's crucial for the reliability of clock signals throughout the module.\n- `sys_rst_n`: This is the system reset signal, generated internally. It combines the global reset (`rst_n`) and the `locked` signal to ensure the system only comes out of reset once the PLL is stable.\n- `error_flag`: This signal is used to indicate the presence of an error condition, typically related to SDRAM operations.
