Module name: led_disp. 
Module specification: The 'led_disp' module is designed for toggling an LED's state based on input conditions, providing a visual indication of operational status or error presence, controlled by a 50 MHz system clock and a reset signal. It processes input signals including 'clk_50m' (a 50 MHz clock signal), 'rst_n' (a negative-active reset), and 'error_flag' (indicating error when high). The output 'led' represents the state of an external LED which visually signifies system conditions. Internally, 'led_disp' uses a 25-bit counter 'led_cnt', which counts up to 25,000,000 and resets, helping synchronize LED toggling. The module contains two main always blocks; one manages the counter behavior based on clock and reset conditions, and the other controls LED states depending on the 'error_flag' status and counter value, enabling the LED to toggle when an error is indicated or remain on when no error is present. This structured approach ensures clear functionality under varying conditions, with the LED's behavior used as a direct, visible output reflecting system status or errors.
