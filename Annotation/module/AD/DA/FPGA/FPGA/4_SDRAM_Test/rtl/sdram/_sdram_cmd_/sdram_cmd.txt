Module-level comment: The 'sdram_cmd' module manages SDRAM control commands, adjusting for read/write operations, burst lengths, and SDRAM states. It synchronizes to a clock and utilizes an internal state machine, driven by an always block, to output signals for SDRAM control (like `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, etc.) based on initialization and operating states. It determines SDRAM addresses from system inputs, handling necessary SDRAM timing and command sequences.
