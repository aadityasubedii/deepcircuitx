    "spec": "Module name: SRAM\nModule specification: The SRAM module is designed to act as an interface controller for SDRAM memory, handling initialization, and facilitating write and read operations with proper command signalling. It orchestrates the handling of clock generation, SDRAM tests, LED indications, and comprehensive data management via its submodules. The `clk` input port is the primary clock source which, along with the active-low synchronous reset `rst_n`, initializes the SDRAM and maintains correct timing across operations. The output ports include `sdram_clk`, `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`, `sdram_ba`, `sdram_addr`, `sdram_data`, `sdram_dqm`, and `led`, which correspond to the SDRAM signaling, data communication interface, and status indication respectively. Internally, signals such as `clk_50m`, `clk_100m`, `clk_100m_shift`, `wr_en`, `wr_data`, `rd_en`, `rd_data`, `sdram_init_done`, `locked`, `sys_rst_n`, and `error_flag` manage timing requirements, data transfer control, initialization status, system reset post PLL locking, and error conditions. The code is divided into several key blocks: `pll_clk` is for PLL-based clock management, `sdram_test` contains logic for SDRAM testing and initialization, `led_disp` handles LED status display, and `sdram_top` serves as the top-level logic that interfaces directly with the SDRAM, incorporating all aforementioned functionalities. Each of these blocks contributes to the reliable and efficient operation of SDRAM memory when interfaced using the SRAM module.",

                    "text": "Module name: SRAM\nModule specification: The SRAM module is designed to act as an interface controller for SDRAM memory, handling initialization, and facilitating write and read operations with proper command signalling. It orchestrates the handling of clock generation, SDRAM tests, LED indications, and comprehensive data management via its submodules. The `clk` input port is the primary clock source which, along with the active-low synchronous reset `rst_n`, initializes the SDRAM and maintains correct timing across operations. The output ports include `sdram_clk`, `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`, `sdram_ba`, `sdram_addr`, `sdram_data`, `sdram_dqm`, and `led`, which correspond to the SDRAM signaling, data communication interface, and status indication respectively. Internally, signals such as `clk_50m`, `clk_100m`, `clk_100m_shift`, `wr_en`, `wr_data`, `rd_en`, `rd_data`, `sdram_init_done`, `locked`, `sys_rst_n`, and `error_flag` manage timing requirements, data transfer control, initialization status, system reset post PLL locking, and error conditions. The code is divided into several key blocks: `pll_clk` is for PLL-based clock management, `sdram_test` contains logic for SDRAM testing and initialization, `led_disp` handles LED status display, and `sdram_top` serves as the top-level logic that interfaces directly with the SDRAM, incorporating all aforementioned functionalities. Each of these blocks contributes to the reliable and efficient operation of SDRAM memory when interfaced using the SRAM module."
