The module interfaces with the SDRAM and handles operations such as initialization, read, write, and refresh cycles. It does this by managing various states for initialization (`init_state`) and operation (`work_state`), and it counts clock cycles (`cnt_clk`) to meet specific timing requirements defined by SDRAM specifications.\n\nIt accepts commands to write (`sdram_wr_req`) and read (`sdram_rd_req`) with acknowledgment outputs for the same (`sdram_wr_ack`, `sdram_rd_ack`). There are also burst lengths for read and write operations given by `sdram_wr_burst` and `sdram_rd_burst`. \n\nThe module oversees the SDRAM initialization sequence after power-up (`init_state`), ensuring all preliminary steps like precharge, auto-refresh, and mode register set are completed (`sdram_init_done` outputs the status). Once initialized, it manages the SDRAM's operation, including refresh cycles to prevent data loss. The flags `sdram_rd_wr` and `cnt_rst_n` are likely used internally to track the SDRAM's state and control the counting logic for different timings, respectively."
