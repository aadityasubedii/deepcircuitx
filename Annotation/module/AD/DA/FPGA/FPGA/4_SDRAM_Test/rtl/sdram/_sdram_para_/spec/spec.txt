Module name: SDRAM_Controller_Module.

Module specification: The SDRAM_Controller_Module is designed to manage interactions with SDRAM memory, including initialization, reading, writing, refreshing, and other necessary operations. While the provided code does not include explicit Verilog module declarations and lacks definitions for input and output ports, it sets up a comprehensive set of `define` macros for commands, states, timing conditions, and instruction codes intended for use in a larger SDRAM controller system. Internal signals, while not explicitly declared in the code snippet, likely include cnt_clk for counting clock cycles and several specific cycle counts like TRP_CLK, TRC_CLK, and others to manage various timing-sensitive operations in compliance with SDRAM protocol requirements. These timing signals ensure crucial delays are met between different memory operations, such as reads, writes, and refreshes.

The code essentially divides into several sections, each defining a specific part of the controller's operation:
1. **Instruction Codes (`I_NOP`, `I_PRE`, etc.):** Define various operation phases the controller can execute.
2. **State Machine States (`W_IDLE`, `W_ACTIVE`, etc.):** Outline the various states within the operational protocol of the SDRAM.
3. **Timing Conditions (`end_trp`, `end_trfc`, etc.):** Establish conditions for transitions between states based on timing requirements.
4. **Command Codes (`CMD_INIT`, `CMD_NOP`, etc.):** Specify the set of commands that can be sent to the SDRAM to control its operations.

This code setup, focusing on defining constants and conditions, demonstrates preparatory measures for a more complex and interactive handling of memory control operations, ensuring that all actions adhere to the specific timings required by the SDRAM specifications.
