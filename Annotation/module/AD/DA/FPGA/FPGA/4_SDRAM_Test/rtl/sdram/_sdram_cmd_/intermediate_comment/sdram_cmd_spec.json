    "spec": "Module name: sdram_cmd.\n\nModule specification: The 'sdram_cmd' module is responsible for generating SDRAM control command signals based on a variety of input parameters, including system addresses for reads and writes, burst lengths, and current state information regarding initialization and normal operation. The module operates in sync with a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst_n`). Inputs include system write (`sys_wraddr`) and read addresses (`sys_rdaddr`), burst lengths for both writing (`sdram_wr_burst`) and reading (`sdram_rd_burst`), as well as signals indicating the initialization (`init_state`) and working states (`work_state`) of the SDRAM. There is also a counter clock signal (`cnt_clk`) and an operation type selector (`sdram_rd_wr`). Outputs from the module include the various control signals for the SDRAM, such as Clock Enable (`sdram_cke`), Chip Select (`sdram_cs_n`), Row Address Strobe (`sdram_ras_n`), Column Address Strobe (`sdram_cas_n`), Write Enable (`sdram_we_n`), as well as selected bank address (`sdram_ba`) and the address to be accessed within the SDRAM bank (`sdram_addr`). Internally, the module uses `sdram_cmd_r` to store the current command for the SDRAM in a 5-bit register that directly controls the output signals, and `sys_addr` to select between write and read addresses depending on the operation being performed.\n\nThe module's code consists of signal assignments and an always block that executes on the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset. Signal assignments connect the outputs to the `sdram_cmd_r` register and select the system address based on the read/write selector. The always block contains a state machine that sets the internal `sdram_cmd_r`, `sdram_ba`, and `sdram_addr` signals according to the SDRAM's initialization state and operating state. This block handles various cases for initializing the SDRAM (e.g., No Operation, Precharge, Auto-refresh, Load Mode Register, Initialization Done) and normal operation commands (e.g., Active, Read, Write, Burst Termination, Precharge, Auto-refresh). Based on these states, it updates control outputs to drive the SDRAM device correctly. The included \"sdram_para.v\" file is assumed to contain parameter definitions used within the module, such as command codes and timing configuration.",

It is a 5-bit register resulting in 32 possible states/command combinations. The value stored in this register directly controls the SDRAM control signals (`sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`) through a simple bitwise assignment.\n\n- `sys_addr`: This wire signal is used to select between `sys_wraddr` and `sys_rdaddr` based on the current operation. If a read operation is being executed (`sdram_rd_wr` is 1), `sys_rdaddr` is used; otherwise, for a write operation, `sys_wraddr` is selected. It effectively combines the address inputs into a singular signal that can be manipulated within the module to set the SDRAM's bank address and the address signal."

It is a 5-bit register resulting in 32 possible states/command combinations. The value stored in this register directly controls the SDRAM control signals (`sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`) through a simple bitwise assignment.\n\n- `sys_addr`: This wire signal is used to select between `sys_wraddr` and `sys_rdaddr` based on the current operation. If a read operation is being executed (`sdram_rd_wr` is 1), `sys_rdaddr` is used; otherwise, for a write operation, `sys_wraddr` is selected. It effectively combines the address inputs into a singular signal that can be manipulated within the module to set the SDRAM's bank address and the address signal."

The module operates in sync with a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst_n`). Inputs include system write (`sys_wraddr`) and read addresses (`sys_rdaddr`), burst lengths for both writing (`sdram_wr_burst`) and reading (`sdram_rd_burst`), as well as signals indicating the initialization (`init_state`) and working states (`work_state`) of the SDRAM. There is also a counter clock signal (`cnt_clk`) and an operation type selector (`sdram_rd_wr`). Outputs from the module include the various control signals for the SDRAM, such as Clock Enable (`sdram_cke`), Chip Select (`sdram_cs_n`), Row Address Strobe (`sdram_ras_n`), Column Address Strobe (`sdram_cas_n`), Write Enable (`sdram_we_n`), as well as selected bank address (`sdram_ba`) and the address to be accessed within the SDRAM bank (`sdram_addr`). Internally, the module uses `sdram_cmd_r` to store the current command for the SDRAM in a 5-bit register that directly controls the output signals, and `sys_addr` to select between write and read addresses depending on the operation being performed.\n\nThe module's code consists of signal assignments and an always block that executes on the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset. Signal assignments connect the outputs to the `sdram_cmd_r` register and select the system address based on the read/write selector. The always block contains a state machine that sets the internal `sdram_cmd_r`, `sdram_ba`, and `sdram_addr` signals according to the SDRAM's initialization state and operating state. This block handles various cases for initializing the SDRAM (e.g., No Operation, Precharge, Auto-refresh, Load Mode Register, Initialization Done) and normal operation commands (e.g., Active, Read, Write, Burst Termination, Precharge, Auto-refresh). Based on these states, it updates control outputs to drive the SDRAM device correctly. The included \"sdram_para.v\" file is assumed to contain parameter definitions used within the module, such as command codes and timing configuration."
