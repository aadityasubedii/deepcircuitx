Module name: sdram_fifo_ctrl. Module specification: The `sdram_fifo_ctrl` module is designed to facilitate the interfacing between an FPGA/ASIC system and Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (SDRAM) through FIFO-buffered read and write operations, managed under potentially different clock domains for read and write operations. The module includes input ports such as `clk_ref` (reference clock for synchronization), `rst_n` (active-low reset signal), clocks for read (`clk_read`) and write (`clk_write`) operations, write and read request signals (`wrf_wrreq`, `rdf_rdreq`), data inputs (`wrf_din`, `sdram_dout`), address range and block size specifications (`wr_min_addr`, `wr_max_addr`, `wr_length`, `rd_min_addr`, `rd_max_addr`, `rd_length`), initialization and ready signals from SDRAM (`sdram_init_done`, `sdram_read_valid`), and load controls for read/write operations (`wr_load`, `rd_load`). Its output ports include `sdram_wr_req`, `sdram_rd_req` (control signals for initiating SDRAM operations), `sdram_wr_addr`, `sdram_rd_addr` (addresses for SDRAM operations), and `sdram_din`, `rdf_dout` (data handling between FIFOs and SDRAM). Internal signals like `wr_ack_r1`, `wr_ack_r2` (edge detection for write acknowledgments), and similarly for read operations and loads (`rd_ack_r1`, `rd_ack_r2`, `wr_load_r1`, `wr_load_r2`, etc.), facilitate the internal state management. The module architecture integrates distinct blocks such as FIFO instances `u_wrfifo` and `u_rdfifo` for handling the data buffering with SDRAM, and sequential logic blocks for address calculation, control signal generation, and read/write operations management based on FIFO status and initialization signals. This structured approach allows efficient data flow control, adhering to specified memory and data transfer parameters, ensuring robust data integrity and timely accesses aligned with system and memory constraints.
