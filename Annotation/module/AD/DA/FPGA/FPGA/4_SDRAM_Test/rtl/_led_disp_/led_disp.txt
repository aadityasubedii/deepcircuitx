Module-level comment: The 'led_disp' module controls an LED based on system status, toggling the LED for error indication. It employs a 50 MHz clock (clk_50m) and a reset signal (rst_n) to manage a 25-bit counter (led_cnt). The LED toggles at a defined count if 'error_flag' is high; otherwise, it remains on, signaling regular operation. Key operations are split across two always blocks; one for counting and another for setting the LED state based on the error condition and count.
