    "spec": "Module name: sdram_data.\nModule specification: The 'sdram_data' module is tailored for interfacing with SDRAM to facilitate both read and write operations based on the input states. It accommodates multiple input signals including 'clk' (a clock signal for synchronization), 'rst_n' (an active-low reset for initialization), 'sdram_data_in' (a 16-bit input data bus for data intended for SDRAM), 'work_state' (a 4-bit signal dictating the current SDRAM operation), and 'cnt_clk' (a 10-bit signal likely used for wider operational timing, not directly involved in this module). The module outputs data through 'sdram_data_out', a 16-bit output data bus that carries data retrieved from the SDRAM. The 'sdram_data' is a 16-bit bidirectional bus managed by internal logic to either drive or receive data based on the operation mode commanded through 'sdram_out_en'. Internal registers 'sdram_out_en', 'sdram_din_r', and 'sdram_dout_r' are employed to manage the read/write operations, and the direction of the data flow. The implementation includes separate always blocks: one controlling the enable signal 'sdram_out_en' to direct data flow, another always block capturing data to be written to the SDRAM into 'sdram_din_r', and a final block for reading data from SDRAM into 'sdram_dout_r'. These blocks function synchronously with the clock and asynchronously reset upon a low signal on 'rst_n', ensuring data integrity and proper flow control between the controller and SDRAM.",

It utilizes input signals to determine reading or writing operations and manages the bidirectional data bus of the SDRAM. Specifically, the module takes an input data stream (sdram_data_in), controls its flow to the SDRAM based on operational states (work_state), and fetches data from the SDRAM onto an output stream (sdram_data_out). Key actions, such as enabling data output (sdram_out_en) and storing data temporarily (sdram_din_r and sdram_dout_r), are controlled via state checks and synchronized to the rising edge of a system clock while being initially set or reset with the system reset signal (rst_n). The bi-directionality of the SDRAM data bus (sdram_data) is managed by an enable signal that dictates whether the bus carries outgoing valid data or remains in a high-impedance state. This module is critical in facilitating the reading from and writing to the SDRAM in different operational states of a system."

When `sdram_out_en` is high (`1'b1`), the module drives `sdram_data_in` onto the `sdram_data` bus, indicating a write operation to the SDRAM.

It captures data from the `sdram_data_in` based on the state (`W_WRITE` or `W_WD`), which represents write conditions. The content of this register is driven onto the `sdram_data` bus when `sdram_out_en` is activated.\n- **sdram_dout_r**: This 16-bit register temporarily stores the data read from the SDRAM. It captures the data from the bidirectional `sdram_data` bus during read states (`W_RD`).
