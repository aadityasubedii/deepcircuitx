Module-level comment: The 'sdram_top' module interfaces between a system and SDRAM, handling initialization, and managing read/write operations via FIFO buffering and protocol-specific signaling. It leverages dual sub-modules: 'sdram_fifo_ctrl' for data buffering and transaction controls, and 'sdram_controller' for direct SDRAM protocol interactions, ensuring efficient data flow and correct SDRAM operation under various system and memory clocks.
