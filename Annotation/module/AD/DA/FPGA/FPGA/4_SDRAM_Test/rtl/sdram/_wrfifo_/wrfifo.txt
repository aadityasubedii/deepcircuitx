Module-level comment: The 'wrfifo' module implements a dual-clock FIFO buffer for Altera Cyclone II FPGAs, transferring data between separate read/write clock domains. It features inputs for asynchronous clear, data, read/write controls, and outputs for FIFO data and status. Internally, it uses signals tied to the core 'dcfifo_component' which manages synchronization, data storage, and retrieval, configured for speed and depth parameters suitable for the intended FPGA family.
