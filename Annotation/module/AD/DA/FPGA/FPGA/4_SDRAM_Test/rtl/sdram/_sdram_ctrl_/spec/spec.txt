Module name: sdram_ctrl. Module specification: The `sdram_ctrl` module is designed to manage the operations of a Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (SDRAM) by handling tasks such as initialization, read, write, and refresh cycles according to specific timing requirements. The module operates on a clock signal (`clk`) and is reset through an active-low reset signal (`rst_n`). Input ports include `sdram_wr_req` and `sdram_rd_req` for write and read requests, respectively, and `sdram_wr_burst` and `sdram_rd_burst` to specify the burst lengths for these operations. Outputs consist of acknowledgment signals (`sdram_wr_ack`, `sdram_rd_ack`) indicating the status of read and write requests, `sdram_init_done` for initialization status, the states of initialization and operation (`init_state`, `work_state`), a clock cycle counter (`cnt_clk`), and a mode operation signal (`sdram_rd_wr`). Internal signals like `cnt_200us` and `cnt_refresh` are used to manage timing delays and refresh cycles. Other signals, such as `sdram_ref_req`, `cnt_rst_n`, and `sdram_ref_ack`, help control refresh requests and reset certain counters. The code includes various always blocks that implement state machines for managing the different phases of initialization (`init_state`) and operational states (`work_state`), and combinational logic to update control signals and track counters like `cnt_200us` and `cnt_refresh`. These blocks collectively ensure the SDRAM operates reliably under the specified constraints and timings of SDRAM operation.
