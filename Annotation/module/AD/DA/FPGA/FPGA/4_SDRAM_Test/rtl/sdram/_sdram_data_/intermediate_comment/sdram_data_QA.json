It utilizes input signals to determine reading or writing operations and manages the bidirectional data bus of the SDRAM. Specifically, the module takes an input data stream (sdram_data_in), controls its flow to the SDRAM based on operational states (work_state), and fetches data from the SDRAM onto an output stream (sdram_data_out). Key actions, such as enabling data output (sdram_out_en) and storing data temporarily (sdram_din_r and sdram_dout_r), are controlled via state checks and synchronized to the rising edge of a system clock while being initially set or reset with the system reset signal (rst_n). The bi-directionality of the SDRAM data bus (sdram_data) is managed by an enable signal that dictates whether the bus carries outgoing valid data or remains in a high-impedance state. This module is critical in facilitating the reading from and writing to the SDRAM in different operational states of a system."

When `sdram_out_en` is high (`1'b1`), the module drives `sdram_data_in` onto the `sdram_data` bus, indicating a write operation to the SDRAM. Conversely, when it is low (`1'b0`), the bus is set to high-impedance (`16'hzzzz`), suitable for read operations or when no data transaction is intended.\n- **sdram_din_r**: This 16-bit register temporarily holds the data that is to be written onto the SDRAM. It captures data from the `sdram_data_in` based on the state (`W_WRITE` or `W_WD`), which represents write conditions. The content of this register is driven onto the `sdram_data` bus when `sdram_out_en` is activated.\n- **sdram_dout_r**: This 16-bit register temporarily stores the data read from the SDRAM. It captures the data from the bidirectional `sdram_data` bus during read states (`W_RD`). The data captured in this register is then outputted through the `sdram_data_out` port for further use outside the module."
