    "spec": "Module name: sdram_top. \n\nModule specification: The 'sdram_top' module functions as an interface between a system and SDRAM, facilitating initialization, and managing read and write operations according to the SDRAM protocol. The input ports include various clock inputs (`ref_clk`, `out_clk`, `wr_clk`, `rd_clk`) for synchronization, active-low reset (`rst_n`), write and read enable signals (`wr_en`, `rd_en`), corresponding data (`wr_data`), address range (`wr_min_addr`, `wr_max_addr`, `rd_min_addr`, `rd_max_addr`), burst lengths (`wr_len`, `rd_len`), and load signals (`wr_load`, `rd_load`). It also uses the `sdram_read_valid` as feedback for read operations. Output ports include the `rd_data`, general SDRAM control signals (`sdram_clk`, `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`), and SDRAM address and data interfaces (`sdram_ba`, `sdram_addr`, `sdram_data`, `sdram_dqm`), with `sdram_init_done` indicating the completion of the initialization sequence.\n\nInternally, the module employs signals such as `sdram_wr_req`, `sdram_wr_ack`, `sdram_wr_addr`, and `sdram_din` for managing write operations, and `sdram_rd_req`, `sdram_rd_ack`, `sdram_rd_addr`, `sdram_dout` for read operations. These signals help coordinate data flow between the FIFO buffer and the SDRAM controller ensuring efficient and orderly data management.\n\nThe module integrates two main components: 'sdram_fifo_ctrl' and 'sdram_controller'. The 'sdram_fifo_ctrl' manages buffering, handles write and read requests, and interfaces with the system side handling the data input and output from/to the FIFO to the higher-level system. The 'sdram_controller' block interfaces with the lower-level SDRAM hardware managing basic control signals, address multiplexing, timing, and data flow according to the SDRAM protocol timings and requirements. This organized structural approach assures correct initialization, timing, and data handling functionalities between a digital system and an SDRAM memory module.",

The input ports include various clock inputs (`ref_clk`, `out_clk`, `wr_clk`, `rd_clk`) for synchronization, active-low reset (`rst_n`), write and read enable signals (`wr_en`, `rd_en`), corresponding data (`wr_data`), address range (`wr_min_addr`, `wr_max_addr`, `rd_min_addr`, `rd_max_addr`), burst lengths (`wr_len`, `rd_len`), and load signals (`wr_load`, `rd_load`). It also uses the `sdram_read_valid` as feedback for read operations. Output ports include the `rd_data`, general SDRAM control signals (`sdram_clk`, `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`), and SDRAM address and data interfaces (`sdram_ba`, `sdram_addr`, `sdram_data`, `sdram_dqm`), with `sdram_init_done` indicating the completion of the initialization sequence.\n\nInternally, the module employs signals such as `sdram_wr_req`, `sdram_wr_ack`, `sdram_wr_addr`, and `sdram_din` for managing write operations, and `sdram_rd_req`, `sdram_rd_ack`, `sdram_rd_addr`, `sdram_dout` for read operations. These signals help coordinate data flow between the FIFO buffer and the SDRAM controller ensuring efficient and orderly data management.\n\nThe module integrates two main components: 'sdram_fifo_ctrl' and 'sdram_controller'. The 'sdram_fifo_ctrl' manages buffering, handles write and read requests, and interfaces with the system side handling the data input and output from/to the FIFO to the higher-level system. The 'sdram_controller' block interfaces with the lower-level SDRAM hardware managing basic control signals, address multiplexing, timing, and data flow according to the SDRAM protocol timings and requirements. This organized structural approach assures correct initialization, timing, and data handling functionalities between a digital system and an SDRAM memory module."
