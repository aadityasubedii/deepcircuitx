    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_controller` module interfaces with SDRAM to manage initialization, read, and write operations via a structured FSM. It processes input commands and data, delivering data handling, command generation, and control signaling through sub-modules `u_sdram_ctrl`, `u_sdram_cmd`, and `u_sdram_data`, ensuring synchronized, efficient SDRAM management based on clock cycles and state transitions."
