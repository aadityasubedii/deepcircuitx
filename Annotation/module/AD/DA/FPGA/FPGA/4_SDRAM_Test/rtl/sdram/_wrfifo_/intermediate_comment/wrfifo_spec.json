    "spec": "Module name: wrfifo. Module specification: The 'wrfifo' module is a customized, dual-clock FIFO (First In, First Out) memory component tailored for Altera's Cyclone II FPGA family, facilitating buffered data transfer across different clock domains. It accommodates data transfer operations through a series of input ports: 'aclr' for asynchronously clearing the FIFO, a 16-bit 'data' input for feeding data to the FIFO, 'rdclk' and 'wrclk' as the read and write clock inputs respectively to control the timing of data transactions, and 'rdreq' and 'wrreq' signals to initiate read and write operations. The outputs of the module include a 16-bit 'q' for the data output and a 10-bit 'rdusedw' indicating the volume of readable data in the FIFO. Internally, the module employs two signals, 'sub_wire0' and 'sub_wire1', which serve as conduits for the 'rdusedw' and 'q' outputs respectively, directly linking to the 'dcfifo_component', the core FIFO implementation. The Verilog code is structured into several key sections: the module declaration with I/O port definitions, internal signal declarations, instantiation of the 'dcfifo_component' with appropriate parameters for FIFO behavior customization (like family, speed optimization hints, FIFO depth, and data width settings), and specific configurations for error checking and resource usage. This comprehensive structure and defined signal pathways provide a clear framework for the FIFO's operation within the specified FPGA environment.",

The module's external `rdusedw` output is directly driven by this internal signal.\n- `sub_wire1`: This is a 16-bit internal signal connected to the output port of the `dcfifo_component`.
