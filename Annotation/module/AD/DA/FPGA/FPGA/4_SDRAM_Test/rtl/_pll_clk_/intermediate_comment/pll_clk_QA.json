PLLs are used to generate stable clock signals at different frequencies or phase alignments from a single reference input clock. The module takes an asynchronous reset signal (areset) and an input clock signal (inclk0), and it outputs three clock signals (c0, c1, c2), as well as a locked signal indicating when the PLL has achieved lock to the input clock.\n\nThe inputs and outputs are set up as follows:\n- areset: Asynchronous reset input to reset the PLL.\n- inclk0: Input clock signal for the PLL to lock onto.\n- c0, c1, c2: Output clock signals generated by the PLL, possibly with different frequencies and phase shifts.\n- locked: Indicates whether the PLL has achieved and maintains lock to the input clock.\n\nInternally, the module uses a number of wires to convey signals to and from the altpll_component instance. Parameters for the altpll_component are set using the defparam keyword to specify characteristics like bandwidth, clock division/multiplication factors, duty cycle, phase shift, and other PLL-related configuration options. These settings determine the behavior of the output clocks relative to the input clock. The altpll_component instance is connected to a subset of its possible ports for a simple PLL configuration as indicated by the parameters and port usage defined within the defparam block."
