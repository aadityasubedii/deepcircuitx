Module-level comment: The 'sdram_data' module manages the data transfer between an SDRAM and a system controller. It reads and writes data through a bidirectional data bus 'sdram_data' based on an input state 'work_state'. Internally, it uses registers 'sdram_din_r' and 'sdram_dout_r' to buffer input and output data, respectively, while 'sdram_out_en' controls the data flow direction. Data transfer is synchronized with the system clock 'clk' and asynchronously reset via 'rst_n'.
