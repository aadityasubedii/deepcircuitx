Module name: `sdram_controller`.

Module specification: The `sdram_controller` is a hardware module written in Verilog designed to interface with Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM). It facilitates the initialization process and controls read/write operations. The module accommodates inputs such as a clock signal (`clk`), an active-low reset (`rst_n`), commands to request write (`sdram_wr_req`) and read (`sdram_rd_req`) operations, along with associated addresses (`sdram_wr_addr`, `sdram_rd_addr`), burst lengths (`sdram_wr_burst`, `sdram_rd_burst`), and data to be written (`sdram_din`). Outputs include acknowledgments for write (`sdram_wr_ack`) and read (`sdram_rd_ack`) requests, the data read from SDRAM (`sdram_dout`), and various signals to demonstrate the status of initialization (`sdram_init_done`) and to control the SDRAM (`sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`, `sdram_ba`, `sdram_addr`, `sdram_data`). Internal signals such as `init_state`, `work_state`, `cnt_clk`, and `sdram_rd_wr` are used to track the initialization state, manage operational states, count clock cycles, and flag read/write operations respectively. The code consists of three main blocks: `u_sdram_ctrl` manages the controller's state machine, acknowledgment signals and initialization completion; `u_sdram_cmd` generates the necessary SDRAM command signals like enabling the chip and addressing; and `u_sdram_data` handles the data flow between the system and the SDRAM. This separation of concerns facilitates a structured and efficient design for SDRAM interfacing operations.
