Module-level comment: The 'pll_clk_altpll' module generates multiple clocks using three generic PLLs, accepting dual input clocks and an asynchronous reset. It outputs five clock signals, a feedback loop, and a lock status. Internally, it utilizes feedback and output wires linked to each PLL, configures PLL parameters, and assigns outputs and feedback paths efficiently to ensure synchronized and stable clock generation for timing controls in digital circuits.
