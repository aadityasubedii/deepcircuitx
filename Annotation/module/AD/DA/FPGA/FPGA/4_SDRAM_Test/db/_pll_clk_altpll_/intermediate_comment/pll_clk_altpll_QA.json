The module takes two clock inputs (`inclk`) and produces one feedback output (`fbout`), five clock outputs (`clk`), and a lock status (`locked`). Each PLL instance is configured with specific duty cycles, output frequencies, phase shifts, and reference frequencies. The final clock outputs are selectively assigned from the outputs of the instantiated PLLs, and the `fbout` is directly tied to the feedback output of 'generic_pll1'. The module ensures synchronization and stability in generated clocks used typically in digital circuits for timing and control operations."

It is used to reset the internal state of the PLLs to their initial configuration, ensuring that the PLLs start operation from a known state.\n- `inclk`: This is the input clock signals. It is a 2-bit bus (`inclk[1:0]`), with each bit representing a separate clock input. These clocks serve as the reference clocks for the PLLs inside the module.\n\nOutput ports: `clk`, `fbout`, `locked`.\nExplanation: \n- `clk`: This is the output clock signal, a 5-bit bus (`clk[4:0]`) where each bit represents a separate clock output derived from the PLLs. The clocks are generated based on configurations like output frequency and phase shift, tailored to system requirements.\n- `fbout`: This is the feedback output. It carries the feedback clock signal from the output of `generic_pll1` back into the PLLs, forming a feedback loop that helps maintain clock accuracy and stability.\n- `locked`: This signal indicates the lock status of the PLLs. It goes high once the PLL has achieved lock, which denotes that the output frequency and phase are stable and within the operational parameters set by the system design."
