Module name: pll_clk_altpll.
Module specification: The 'pll_clk_altpll' module serves the purpose of generating multiple clock outputs through the utilization of three instances of a generic PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) component named 'generic_pll1', 'generic_pll2', and 'generic_pll3'. It is designed to accept two input clocks (`inclk[1:0]`) and an asynchronous reset signal (`areset`), outputting five clock signals (`clk[4:0]`), a feedback output (`fbout`), and a lock status signal (`locked`). The `areset` port functions as an asynchronous reset, initializing the PLLs' internal states, while the `inclk` ports provide the reference frequencies for the PLLs. The `clk` ports deliver the generated clock signals, `fbout` serves as the feedback connecting output to input ensuring clock stability, and `locked` indicates the PLLs' lock status, achieving stable output frequencies and phases. Internally, signals like `wire_generic_pll1_fboutclk` for carrying the 'generic_pll1' feedback output, `wire_generic_pll1_locked` indicating 'generic_pll1's lock status, output clock wires (`wire_generic_pll1_outclk`, `wire_generic_pll2_outclk`, and `wire_generic_pll3_outclk`) from each PLL instance, and `fb_clkin` for routing the feedback output back to all PLLs are employed for controlling and managing the PLL feedback mechanisms and output clock generation. The Verilog code encompasses sections that define the module's ports, internal signal wiring, instantiation of the PLL components with specific configurations (duty cycles, output frequencies, phase shifts, reference frequencies, and types), and assignment statements for synthesizing the output clocks, feedback loops, and lock status functionality. This structured design ensures the 'pll_clk_altpll' module efficiently generates stable, synchronized clock outputs suitable for various digital circuit timing and control operations.
