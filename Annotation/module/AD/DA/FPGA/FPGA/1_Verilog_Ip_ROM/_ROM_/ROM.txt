Module-level comment: The ROM module serves as a read-only memory component, using an FPGA's synchronous RAM block configured via the `altsyncram` component from Altera. It reads memory content initialized from "chirp.mif". Inputs include an address and clock for synchronization while ignoring the data and write enable inputs due to its read-only nature. Output is data fetched corresponding to the input address. The implementation uses parameters for specifying operation mode, device family, and memory initialization file to tailor the ROM behavior.
