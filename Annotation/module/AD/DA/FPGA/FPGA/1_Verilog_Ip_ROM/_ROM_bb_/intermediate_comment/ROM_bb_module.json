    "module": "Module-level comment: The ROM module serves as a Verilog template to interface a read-only memory (ROM), utilizing a 14-bit address to output 8-bit data. Currently, the module outlines the basic I/O, with provisions for Altera FPGA specifics, but lacks internal memory constructs and operational logic, making it a placeholder for further development."
