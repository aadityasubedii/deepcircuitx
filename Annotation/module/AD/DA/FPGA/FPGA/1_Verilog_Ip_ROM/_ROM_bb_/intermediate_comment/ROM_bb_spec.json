It contains inputs for a 14-bit address (address) used to specify the memory location to be read, a system clock (clock) which in a typical ROM is unnecessary as ROMs are read-only, a redundant 8-bit data input (data) that would normally be used for writing, although writing to ROM is not standard operation, and a write enable signal (wren) which should always be disabled in the case of true ROM. The module's output is an 8-bit data line (q), which is intended to present the data stored at the specified address. The module lacks internal signals as no actual memory cells or logic have been described within the code. Additionally, there are precompiler guards checking for `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS` which would include vendor-specific alterations for Altera FPGA synthesis, and an unusual declaration of the system clock as a tri-state signal (tri1 clock) which may pertain to specific hardware configurations. The actual functioning blocks and behavioral or structural logic are absent, showcasing the need for a complete memory architecture to fulfill the ROM functionality.",

However, in ROM (being read-only), this input may not affect functionality unless used for other purposes or mislabeled.\n- `wren` (1-bit): Write enable signal, which theoretically would allow writing to the ROM when high.
