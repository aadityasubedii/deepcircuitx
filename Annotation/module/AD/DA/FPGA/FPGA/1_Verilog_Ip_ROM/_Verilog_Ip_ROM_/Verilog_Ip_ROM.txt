Module-level comment:
The 'Verilog_Ip_ROM' module interfaces with a ROM, reading 8-bit data from a specified 14-bit address. It synchronizes to a 50 MHz clock and supports asynchronous reset. Direct connections between input/output ports and the instantiated ROM block facilitate data retrieval without extra internal signals.
