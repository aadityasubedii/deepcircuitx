    "spec": "Module name: Verilog_Ip_ROM.\n\nModule specification: \nThe module 'Verilog_Ip_ROM' is designed to interface with a Read-Only Memory (ROM) for reading data based on the supplied address. It operates synchronously with the 50 MHz clock signal `CLK_50M` and reacts to the active low reset signal `rst_n`. The 14-bit input `address` specifies the memory location to be accessed within the ROM. Consequently, the module delivers an 8-bit output `readdata` that contains the data fetched from the ROM at the specified address. Internally, the module does not declare any signals as it directly connects the input ports to the inputs of the instantiated ROM block and directly routes the output of the ROM block to the output port of the module. The code consists of a single ROM instance named 'ROM_inst' which forms the central component of the module. Its ports are tied to the corresponding external interfaces: 'address' to the ROM's address input, 'CLK_50M' to the ROM's clock input, and the ROM's output 'q' to the module's 'readdata' output. There are no additional blocks or control logic within the module, emphasizing a straightforward and efficient design for memory data retrieval.",
