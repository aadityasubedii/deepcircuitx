It acts as a bridge between the ROM and other parts of the system. The module takes a clock input (CLK_50M), a reset signal (rst_n), and a 14-bit address input. It outputs an 8-bit data corresponding to the address from the ROM. The ROM instance within the module connects the address and clock inputs to the ROM and outputs the data read from the ROM to the readdata output of the module."

It is used to initialize or reset the state of the module or ROM to a known state.\n- address: This is a 14-bit input that provides the address of the data that needs to be read from the ROM.\n\nOutput ports: readdata.\nExplanation:\n- readdata: This is an 8-bit output that provides the data read from the given address of the ROM when the module is accessed."
