It controls the initialization process through a state machine mechanism guided by a counter (`init_cnt`). The initialization steps involve a precharge command (`C_PRE`), two auto refresh commands (`C_AREF`), and a mode set command (`C_MSET`), ensuring the SDRAM is ready for use. The commands are issued at different times, marked by parameters (e.g., `init_PRE_TIME`, `init_AREF1_TIME`, etc.), derived from the SDRAM parameters included at the start (`Sdram_Params.h`). The process is managed by clock `Clk` and an active low reset `Rst_n`. The initialization status is indicated by `Init_done`, which becomes high once the process is completed, signaling that the SDRAM is initialized and ready for further operations."

Each state transition or data operation occurs on the rising edge of the `Clk` signal.\n- `Rst_n` is the active-low reset signal. When `Rst_n` is asserted low, it initializes the module's internal counters and logic, resetting the SDRAM initialization process to the starting state.\n\nOutput ports: `Command`, `Saddr`, `Init_done`.\nExplanation:\n- `Command` is a 4-bit output signal that communicates the current command to the SDRAM based on the current state of the initialization process. It sends specific commands like precharge (`C_PRE`), auto-refresh (`C_AREF`), and mode-set (`C_MSET`) at designated times controlled by the internal initialization counter.\n- `Saddr` is an output signal with a width determined by the constant `ASIZE` minus one (`[`ASIZE-1:0]`). It specifies the address to be used with some SDRAM commands, particularly during precharge (where it sets the auto-precharge bit) and mode set operations (where it carries the operating parameters of the SDRAM).\n- `Init_done` is a single-bit output signal that indicates the completion of the SDRAM initialization sequence. It becomes high to signal that initialization is done when the internal counter `init_cnt` reaches `init_END_TIME`. This signal can be used by other parts of the system to know when the SDRAM is ready to be accessed after the proper initialization sequence."
