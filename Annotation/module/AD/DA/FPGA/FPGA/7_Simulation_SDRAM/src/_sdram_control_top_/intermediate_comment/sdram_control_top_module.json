    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_control_top` module interfaces with SDRAM to facilitate synchronized read and write operations. It utilizes input/output control signals, manages internal states and buffer status through FIFO mechanisms, and dynamically adjusts SDRAM addresses and data paths based on operational conditions. This module ensures data integrity and protocol compliance by regulating timings and signal interactions between the system and SDRAM efficiently."
