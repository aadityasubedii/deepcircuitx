Module-level comment: The `sdram_init` module initializes SDRAM by sequencing commands like precharge, auto-refresh, and mode set according to a precise timing controlled by an internal counter (`init_cnt`). It handles inputs `Clk` and `Rst_n` for synchronization and reset, respectively. Outputs include the command type (`Command`), specific command address (`Saddr`), and initialization status (`Init_done`). The module utilizes predefined time constants derived from SDRAM parameters to issue commands at designated times, ensuring the SDRAM is ready for use after the initialization sequence.
