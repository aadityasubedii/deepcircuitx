Module name: sdram_control. Module specification: The `sdram_control` module is designed to interface and manage operations with Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (SDRAM). It handles initialization, read, write, and auto-refresh operations according to input commands and internal state transitions. The input ports include `Clk` (clock signal), `Rst_n` (reset, active low), `Wr` (write enable), `Rd` (read enable), `Caddr`, `Raddr`, and `Baddr` (address signals for column, row, and bank respectively), and `Wr_data` (data to be written to SDRAM). Output ports consist of `Rd_data` (read data from SDRAM), `Rd_data_vaild`, `Wr_data_vaild` (data valid indicators), `Wdata_done`, `Rdata_done` (operation complete signals), SDRAM command signals like `Sa`, `Ba`, `Cs_n`, `Cke`, `Ras_n`, `Cas_n`, `We_n`, `Dq` (data bus), and `Dqm` (data mask). Internal signals such as `init_cmd`, `init_addr` (initialization commands and addresses), and state management counters like `ref_time_cnt` control state transitions and command sequences. The code is organized into blocks for initial settings, state machine updates, address updates, and operation-specific tasks like `auto_ref`, `write_data`, and `read_data`, managing SDRAM interactions in various operational modes (idle, auto-refresh, read, and write). Each section ensures proper timings and operation sequences as required by SDRAM technology.
