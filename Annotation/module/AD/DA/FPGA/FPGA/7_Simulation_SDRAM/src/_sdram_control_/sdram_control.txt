Module-level comment: The `sdram_control` module interfaces with SDRAM to perform initialization, reading, writing, and auto-refresh operations. It utilizes a state machine, internal counters, and tasks such as `auto_ref`, `write_data`, and `read_data` to manage command sequences and timings according to the SDRAM specifications and input requests.
