It handles initialization, reading, writing, and auto-refresh operations based on state transitions determined by control inputs and internal state management. The module implements different states such as idle, auto-refresh (AREF), read, and write to execute SDRAM commands accordingly. It processes input commands such as write (Wr) and read (Rd), addresses, and data, coordinating these with the necessary SDRAM command sequences using internal counters and state machines to ensure correct timing and operation of the SDRAM."
