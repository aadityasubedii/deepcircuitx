It handles read and write operations to and from the SDRAM based on external inputs. It manages data transfer using FIFO buffers for write and read operations, generates addresses for SDRAM transactions, and controls signals to appropriately command the SDRAM based on internally maintained states and operations status. The module interfaces with an external SDRAM control hardware component (`sdram_control` submodule) and FIFO buffers (`fifo_wr` for write operations and `fifo_rd` for read operations), ensuring the correct sequence of operations for data integrity and readiness. The module's ports include system clock inputs, reset signals, data and address inputs for read/write operations, and SDRAM configuration and data paths. Moreover, it manages internal registers to track current address positions for read and write operations and triggers the next operations based on specific conditions and requirements of the SDRAM operational protocol."
