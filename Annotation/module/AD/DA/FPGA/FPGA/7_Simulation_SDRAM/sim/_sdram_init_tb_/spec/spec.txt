Module name: sdram_init_tb.
Module specification: The "sdram_init_tb" module is a Verilog testbench designed to validate the initialization process of a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM). It achieves this by interfacing with an SDRAM initialization module ("sdram_init") and a mock-up SDRAM model ("sdr"). The module possesses two input ports, `Clk` for the primary clock signal and `Rst_n` for an active-low reset signal, both of which control the timing and reset actions within the testbench and SDRAM model. Outputs include a 4-bit `Command` signal controlling SDRAM operations and the `Saddr` carrying the memory address, with `Init_done` indicating completion of the initialization process. Internal signals consist of `sd_clk`, an inverted clock for SDRAM timing, and control signals `Cs_n`, `Ras_n`, `Cas_n`, and `We_n`, all derived from `Command` and commanding chip select, row/column addressing, and write enable functions, respectively. The code is structured into blocks for clock generation, initialization and reset simulation, instantiation of the initialization module and SDRAM model, and mappings for control signals to orchestrate operations across the testbench.
