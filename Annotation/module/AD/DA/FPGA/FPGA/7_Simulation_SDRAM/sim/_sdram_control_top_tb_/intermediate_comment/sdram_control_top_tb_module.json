    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_control_top_tb` module is a testbench for verifying SDRAM control logic. It simulates the SDRAM environment, generating necessary signals like clocks, resets, and data/control flows to test the `sdram_control_top` and `sdr` SDRAM model. The module initializes, performs read/write operations, and monitors the outcomes, ensuring the SDRAM logic functions correctly in various operational scenarios."
