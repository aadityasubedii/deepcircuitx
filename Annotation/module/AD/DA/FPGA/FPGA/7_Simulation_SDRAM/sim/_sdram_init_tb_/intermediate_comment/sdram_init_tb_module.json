    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"sdram_init_tb\" module is a Verilog testbench for SDRAM initialization. It simulates SDRAM control via input clocks and reset, using the \"sdram_init\" module for initialization signals and a mock SDRAM model (\"sdr\"). Key features include clock inversion for SDRAM timing, control signal mappings from initialization output, and realistic reset simulation. It ensures correctness in SDRAM initialization sequences before deployment.\n"
