Module-level comment: This module implements an SDRAM controller, managing bank activation, read/write operations, precharge, auto-refresh, and mode register set. It handles timing constraints, burst operations, and data I/O with DQM handling. The controller uses internal state machines to track bank status, decode commands, and manage data transfer, while adhering to SDRAM timing specifications and supporting configurable burst lengths and CAS latencies.
