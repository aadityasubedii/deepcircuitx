    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_control_tb` is a testbench for validating an SDRAM controller's read/write operations. It exercises the controller using a set of pre-defined write and read tests to ensure proper data handling and signal integrity. The testbench leverages generated clock signals, sequential address generation, and toggling of control flags to simulate realistic SDRAM interactions. Internal feedback loops check data validity and test completion, driving comprehensive functional verification."
