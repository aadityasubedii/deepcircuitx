Module name: sdram_control_top_tb. Module specification: The `sdram_control_top_tb` module serves as a testbench for verifying the functionality of Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (SDRAM) control logic. It does not have traditional input and output ports since it is designed to stimulate and observe the internal module `sdram_control_top` and a simulated SDRAM device (`sdr` instance). Instead, it generates signals such as the main system clock (`Clk`), active-low reset (`Rst_n`), and data write-enable (`Wr_en`) to mimic operational inputs. The testbench monitors data read back from the SDRAM through the `Rd_data` signal to verify correct operation. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `sdram_clk` for SDRAM operation timing, `Sa` for selecting rows and columns within the SDRAM, and control signals (`Cs_n`, `Cke`, `Ras_n`, `Cas_n`, `We_n`) for managing SDRAM operations. The testbench is structured into several sections: initialization of clocks and reset states, instantiation of the `sdram_control_top` module and the `sdr` SDRAM model with connections established via internal signals, and a simulation sequence that exercises the SDRAM control logic by performing write and read operations to test functionality. This comprehensive approach ensures that the SDRAM control logic is thoroughly evaluated for correct operation in a simulated environment reflecting real-world application scenarios.
