Module name: sdr. Module specification: The sdr module represents a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) controller that implements the functionality of an SDRAM chip. It handles bank activation, read and write operations, precharge, auto-refresh, and mode register set, while managing timing constraints and burst operations. The module has input ports for clock (Clk), control signals (Cke, Cs_n, Ras_n, Cas_n, We_n), address (Addr), bank address (Ba), and data mask (Dqm), as well as a bidirectional data bus (Dq) for read and write operations. Internal signals include memory banks, address registers, command buffers, and various control flags to manage SDRAM operations. The code is structured into several blocks, including initialization, clock management, command decoding, timing checks, data input/output handling, and burst
