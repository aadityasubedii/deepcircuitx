Module name: `sdram_control_tb`. 

Module specification: The `sdram_control_tb` serves as a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of an SDRAM controller, focusing on initializing and executing both write and read sequences to the synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM). This testbench utilizes various input ports including `Clk` (a clock signal), `Rst_n` (a reset signal), `Wr` (write enable), `Rd` (read enable), `Caddr` (column address), `Raddr` (row address), `Baddr` (bank address), and `Wr_data` (data to be written to SDRAM). It produces outputs such as `Rd_data` (data read from SDRAM), `Wr_data_vaild` (indicates when the write data is valid), and `Rd_data_vaild` (signals when the read data is valid). Furthermore, it operates with internal signals like `sdram_clk` (an inverted clock signal specific to SDRAM operations) and `Rdata_done` (indicates completion of the read data process). The code itself is structured into blocks handling clock generation, initialization sequence, synchronous write and read operations, and continuous writing based on data validity. These processes collectively validate the correct handling and transfer of data, verifying the SDRAM controller's functionality within a simulated environment.
