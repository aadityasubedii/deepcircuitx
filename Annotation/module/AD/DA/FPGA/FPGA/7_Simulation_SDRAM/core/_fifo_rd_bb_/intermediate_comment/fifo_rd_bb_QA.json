The data presented on this port is written into the FIFO when `wrreq` is asserted.\n- `rdclk`: Read clock input provides the timing for read operations from the FIFO.

The size of this memory block typically depends on the maximum number of elements the FIFO needs to hold and the width of the data (`data` port width).\n\n4. **`count`:** This signal represents the number of elements currently stored in the FIFO. It is used to determine whether the FIFO is empty or full. `count` increments with each successful write operation and decrements with each read operation.
