Module-level comment: The fifo_wr module is intended as a template for a FIFO write operation, interfacing through asynchronous clear (`aclr`), a 16-bit data bus (`data`), read and write clock signals (`rdclk`, `wrclk`), and request signals (`rdreq`, `wrreq`). Outputs include a data bus (`q`), flags (`rdempty`, `wrfull`), and usage counters (`rdusedw`, `wrusedw`). However, the module currently lacks implementation - internal signal definitions, data storage, and control logic must be added to realize actual FIFO functionality.
