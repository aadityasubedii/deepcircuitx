Module name: fifo_wr.
Module specification: The fifo_wr module is a Verilog component designed to manage the writing and reading processes of a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer. It features several input ports: `aclr` for asynchronously clearing the FIFO contents, `data` representing a 16-bit input data bus, `rdclk` and `wrclk` serving as read and write clock inputs, and `rdreq` and `wrreq` acting as read and write request signals. The output ports consist of `q` as a 16-bit data output bus, `rdempty` to signal when the FIFO is empty, `rdusedw` as an 8-bit indication of words available to be read, and `wrfull` and `wrusedw` to indicate the FIFO's full status and count of written words, respectively. The code does not define any internal signals, as the module lacks an implementational body. Neither are there any explicitly defined blocks or sections of logic. The inherently empty module is likely a placeholder or template, providing no operations other than defining the input and output interfaces. For actual functionality, it must be expanded with internal register definitions, control logic, flags, and data storage mechanisms typically associated with FIFO operations. The commented sections pertaining to `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS` suggest provisions for compatibility with Altera FPGA-specific features, such as Quartus II synthesis attributes.
