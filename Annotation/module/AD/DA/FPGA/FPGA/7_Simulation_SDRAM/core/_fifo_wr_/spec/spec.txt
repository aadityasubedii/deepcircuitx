Module name: fifo_wr. Module specification: The module "fifo_wr" implements a dual-clock FIFO interface that facilitates asynchronous read and write operations within an FPGA. Its function is to manage data transaction boundaries between different clock domains, using separate clocks for its read (rdclk) and write (wrclk) operations. The input ports include: 'aclr', an asynchronous clear signal; a 16-bit 'data' bus for incoming write data; 'rdclk' and 'wrclk' as the read and write clock inputs; 'rdreq' and 'wrreq' indicating read and write requests. The module's output ports comprise: a 16-bit 'q' for the FIFO read data; 'rdempty' and 'wrfull' as status flags indicating an empty read buffer and a full write buffer, respectively; 'rdusedw' and 'wrusedw' displaying 8-bit counts of unread and unwritten words. Internally, the module uses wires 'sub_wire0' through 'sub_wire4' to interface between the outputs of the 'dcfifo_component' and the external ports. These internal signals relay status flags and data between the FIFO buffers and the module's external interfaces. The code is structured into a declaration of module ports, internal signal wiring, an instantiation of the 'dcfifo' component with connections to internal signals and outputs, and parameter definitions ('defparam') specifying FIFO characteristics such as memory depth and data width, as tailored for the "Cyclone IV E" FPGA family. The code embodies a clear separation of concerns, dividing the parameter configuration, internal logic wiring, and external interface exposures to ensure modularity and readability in the FIFO interface's implementation.
