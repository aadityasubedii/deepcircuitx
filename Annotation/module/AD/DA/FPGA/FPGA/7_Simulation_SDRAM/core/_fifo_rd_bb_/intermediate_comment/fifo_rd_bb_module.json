    "module": "Module-level comment: The `fifo_rd` module interfaces with a FIFO, enabling data to be read and written synchronously via separate clocks. It provides status flags for FIFO empty/full conditions and tracks the FIFO's read/write occupancy. The implementation awaits, including internal pointers, memory blocks, and logic for handling read/write requests and maintaining counters."
