Module-level comment: The `control_interface` module manages SDRAM interactions through command processing and control signal generation. It takes inputs like commands and addresses, synchronizes them with the system clock and processes reset, refresh, and initialization acknowledgements. Internally, the module utilizes timers for refresh and initialization control sequences, generating outputs such as operation indicators and necessary action requests. Key blocks handle signal resets, command execution, and initialization to ensure timely and accurate SDRAM management.
