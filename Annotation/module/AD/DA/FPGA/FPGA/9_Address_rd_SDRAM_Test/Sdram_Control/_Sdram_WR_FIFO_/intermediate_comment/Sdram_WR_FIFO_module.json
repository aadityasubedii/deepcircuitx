    "module": "Module-level comment: The Sdram_WR_FIFO module implements a FIFO buffer for SDRAM write operations using a dual-clock FIFO. It supports separate read (rdclk) and write (wrclk) clock domains, and handles write requests (wrreq) and read requests (rdreq) with associated data input (data) and output (q) ports. Internally, it uses a dcfifo_component with configurable parameters tailored for Cyclone V devices using M10K memory blocks, enabling reliable data transactions while preventing buffer overflow and underflow."
