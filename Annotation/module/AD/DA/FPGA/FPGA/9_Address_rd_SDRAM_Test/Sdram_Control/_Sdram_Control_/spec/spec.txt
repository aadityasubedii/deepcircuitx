Module name: Sdram_Control. 

Module specification: The Sdram_Control module is designed to interface with and control SDRAM operations including initialization, reading, writing, and memory management through input and output ports and internal logic implementation. It accepts a reference clock (REF_CLK), a reset signal (RESET_N), and command signals to/from the system bus like WR, RD, etc., to manage data transactions. Output ports include SDRAM control signals such as SDRAM address (SA), bank address (BA), and command signals like chip select (CS_N), clock enable (CKE), among others. Additionally, it manages data flow through FIFOs for both read and write operations indicating buffer statuses via WR_FULL, RD_EMPTY, etc. Internally, the module employs addresses tracking registers (e.g., rWR_ADDR, rRD_ADDR), control flags (e.g., WR_MASK, RD_MASK), and FSM states to orchestrate read/write operations and their timings. Various components such as Sdram_PLL0, control_interface, command, and sdr_data_path are utilized for clock management, transaction command handling, and data handling respectively, coordinating the overall operation to meet SDRAM protocol and timing requirements. This modular design segments operations logically enhancing readability and maintainability of the code.
