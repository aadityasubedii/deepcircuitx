Module name: control_interface.

Module specification: The `control_interface` module is designed primarily to facilitate communication between a controlling unit and an SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory) by generating appropriate commands and control signals based on the operational requirements. This module takes input signals including `CLK` (Clock input for synchronization), `RESET_N` (Active low reset for initializations), `CMD` (3-bit command signal for operation selection), `ADDR` (Address input for specifying memory operation addresses), `REF_ACK` (Refresh acknowledge from the SDRAM), `INIT_ACK` (Initialization acknowledge from the SDRAM), and `CM_ACK` (Command acknowledge signal). It produces outputs such as `NOP`, `READA`, `WRITEA`, `REFRESH`, `PRECHARGE`, `LOAD_MODE` (signals indicating the type of operation to be performed), `SADDR` (output memory address), `REF_REQ` (refresh request signal), `INIT_REQ` (initialization request signal), and `CMD_ACK` (command acknowledge output). Internal signals like `timer` and `init_timer` are utilized for timing refresh requests and SDRAM initialization sequences. Auxiliary signals, including the statuses of various operations such as NOP, READA, WRITEA, among others, help in the conditional management within the module. The Verilog code is organized into multiple always blocks focusing on different aspects: one handles output and internal signal reset conditions on encountering a reset input, another manages command processing and address forwarding, a separate block is dedicated to refresh timing and requests, and the last block orchestrates the initialization sequence of the SDRAM, including the timed sequencing of precharge, refresh, and load mode setting operations. Each of these blocks executes synchronously with the rising edge of the `CLK` and appropriately responds to the `RESET_N` signal to maintain proper initial conditions, thus ensuring the module efficiently manages SDRAM operations through calculated control signal generation and acknowledgment processing.
