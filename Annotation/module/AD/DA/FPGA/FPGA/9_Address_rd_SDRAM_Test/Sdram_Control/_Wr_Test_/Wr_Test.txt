Module-level comment: The 'Wr_Test' module serves as a memory operation tester, exercising write and read functionalities. Employing a finite state machine (FSM) and synchronized by 'iCLK', it processes input signals 'iRST_n', 'iBUTTON', and 'readdata' to control write/read cycles. The FSM uses internal signals for edge detection, sequencing, and data handling, outputting test statuses through 'drv_status_fail', 'drv_status_pass', and 'drv_status_test_complete'. The module monitors the correctness of memory operations by comparing expected and actual data.
