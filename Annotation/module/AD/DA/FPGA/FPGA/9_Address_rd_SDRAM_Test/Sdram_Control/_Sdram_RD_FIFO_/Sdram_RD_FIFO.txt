Module-level comment: The Sdram_RD_FIFO module is a dual-clock FIFO designed for SDRAM read operations, facilitating data management between asynchronous clock domains. The module incorporates a `dcfifo_component` configured for a Cyclone V device, handling data with signals like `aclr`, `data`, `rdclk`, `rdreq`, `wrclk`, and `wrreq`. Output ports include `q`, `rdempty`, `rdusedw`, `wrfull`, and `wrusedw`, with internal wires linking these to the FIFO component to safely transition data across clock domains.
