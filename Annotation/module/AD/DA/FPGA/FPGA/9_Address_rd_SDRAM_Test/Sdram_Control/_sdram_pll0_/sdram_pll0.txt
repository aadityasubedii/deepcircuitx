Module-level comment: The `sdram_pll0` module is a wrapper for SDRAM system clock management, generating multiple clock frequencies from a reference signal. It instantiates `sdram_pll0_0002` to produce two clock outputs and a lock indication without additional internal logic, directly interfacing provided I/O ports with the instantiated PLL component.
