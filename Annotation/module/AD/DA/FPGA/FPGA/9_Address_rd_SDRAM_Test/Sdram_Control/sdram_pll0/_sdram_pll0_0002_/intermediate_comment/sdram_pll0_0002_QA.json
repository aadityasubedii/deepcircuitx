It uses an Altera-specific PLL instantiation to generate two output clocks from a reference clock. The first output clock is set to 100 MHz with a phase shift of 0 ps, and the second is also 100 MHz but with a phase shift of -3000 ps. Both have a duty cycle set at 50%. The module handles resetting of the PLL and provides a lock indicator to signal when the PLL is stable and operational. The rest of the PLL output clocks are not used as their frequencies are set to 0 MHz."

It serves as the base timing source from which the PLL generates the output clocks. In this module, it's presumably coming from an external or another internal clock source and operates at a frequency specified (`50.0 MHz`) for the PLL configuration.\n- `rst` is the reset input to the PLL. It is used to reset the internal state of the PLL. When asserted (`rst`=1), it will reinitialize the PLL, which can be used to ensure the PLL starts correctly or to recover from any operational errors.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`. \nExplanation: \n- `outclk_0` is the first output clock of the PLL, set to `100.000000 MHz` with a phase shift of `0 ps` and a duty cycle of 50%. It is one of the primary generated clocks intended for use in the system, probably to drive synchronous logic or another module that requires a specific clocking rate.\n- `outclk_1` is the second output clock of the PLL, set to `100.000000 MHz` but with a phase shift of `-3000 ps` and a duty cycle of 50%. This is also a primary clock output and may be used where a specific phase-shifted clock signal is required, perhaps for clock domain crossing or timing adjustments in the system.\n- `locked` is a status signal indicating whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the input reference clock (`refclk`). When `locked`=1, it signifies the PLL outputs are stable and can be relied upon for clocking purposes. This is critical for ensuring the reliable operation of any downstream logic or modules that depend on the PLL-generated clocks."
