Module name: command.

Module specification: The command module is designed for interfacing with SDRAM, generating control signals for various memory operations such as read, write, refresh, precharge, and load mode configurations. Inputs include a clock signal (CLK) for synchronization, an active-low reset (RESET_N), a multiplexed addressing input (SADDR), and several command signals (NOP, READA, WRITEA, etc.) to initiate specific SDRAM operations. The status of these operations is communicated via outputs like command acknowledgment (CM_ACK), refresh acknowledgment (REF_ACK), and the output enable (OE). The module uses internal registers like do_reada and do_writea to handle read and write operations, do_refresh for refresh commands, and additional signals for precise timing control (command_delay, rw_shift) and pipeline execution of commands. Key Verilog code blocks include the main sequential block, which updates internal state machines based on input commands, a block for managing output enable timing using shift registers (oe_shift), a block for handling the timing of read and write operations based on configured delays (rw_shift), and a block for generating the appropriate control signals (RAS_N, CAS_N, WE_N) to the SDRAM based on the current operation. These blocks work in tandem to meet the timing requirements for SDRAM control, ensuring data integrity and system performance.
