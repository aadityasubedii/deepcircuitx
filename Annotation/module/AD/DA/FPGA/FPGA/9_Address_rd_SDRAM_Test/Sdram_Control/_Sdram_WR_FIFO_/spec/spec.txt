Module name: Sdram_WR_FIFO.
Module specification: The `Sdram_WR_FIFO` module is a Verilog implementation of a FIFO buffer specifically designed to manage write operations to SDRAM. It utilizes a dual-clock FIFO (dcfifo) to handle data with separate clocks for read and write operations, enabling asynchronous data transactions between different domain components. The inputs to the module include `aclr` (asynchronous clear), `data` (16-bit data for writing), `rdclk` (read clock), `rdreq` (read request), `wrclk` (write clock), and `wrreq` (write request). The outputs are `q` (16-bit output data bus), `rdempty` (indicating if the buffer is empty), `rdusedw` (9-bit output showing the read buffer usage), `wrfull` (indicating if the buffer is full), and `wrusedw` (9-bit output showing the buffer usage after writes). Internal signals such as `sub_wire0` to `sub_wire4` bridge the dcfifo component and module outputs, handling data and status transfers between the subcomponent and the interface ports. The code is structured with parameter definitions for the dcfifo component specifying its configuration such as the device family "Cyclone V", use of RAM block type "M10K", buffer word size, data width, and various checks for overflow and underflow conditions. This structured and parameterized implementation supports robust SDRAM data management through efficient FIFO buffering in variable clock domain scenarios.
