Module name: sdr_data_path. 
Module specification: The `sdr_data_path` module is designed for the SDRAM interface, primarily managing data flow and masking during write operations. It synchronizes with the system clock (`CLK`) and responds to an active-low reset signal (`RESET_N`). The module has two main input ports: `DATAIN`, a data input which is a [`DSIZE-1:0`] bit wide bus conveying the data to be written to SDRAM; and `DM`, a data mask input which is a [`DSIZE/8-1:0`] bit wide bus that specifies which data bytes should be considered valid or masked. It also has two output ports: `DQOUT`, a [`DSIZE-1:0`] bit wide data output bus that connects directly to the SDRAM data inputs; and `DQM`, a [`DSIZE/8-1:0`] bit wide output data mask bus that controls byte masking of the output data. Internally, `DQM` is also designated as a register to hold the mask state, being set to all ones upon a reset or otherwise following the `DM` input signals. The module's code is structured into two main sections: an include directive which pulls in relevant parameters from `Sdram_Params.h` that define `DSIZE`, and an always block that dictates the behavior of the `DQM` signal under clock and reset conditions, along with an assign statement that directly maps `DATAIN` to `DQOUT`, allowing for unaltered data flow to the SDRAM.
