Explanation: The module `sdram_pll0` is designed for generating different clock frequencies and a locked signal for an SDRAM system based on a reference clock input. It encapsulates an instance of `sdram_pll0_0002`, which is presumably a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) component, configured with inputs for a reference clock (`refclk`), reset signal (`rst`), and outputs for two derived clock signals (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`), along with a `locked` signal indicating the PLL has achieved and is maintaining the desired frequency lock. The specific use of two output clocks suggests the module may be used to generate different phases or frequencies of clocks needed by the SDRAM controller or memory itself, thus facilitating synchronous operation."

It serves as the basic timing input from which the PLL generates other output clock frequencies required by the system.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input, which is typically used to reset the internal state of the PLL. It ensures that the PLL starts cleanly or can recover in case of errors or specific conditions that necessitate reinitialization.\n\nOutput ports: [outclk_0, outclk_1, locked]. Explanation:\n- `outclk_0`: This is one of the output clocks generated by the PLL. It is likely tailored to meet specific frequency requirements for operating certain parts of the SDRAM or related subsystems.\n- `outclk_1`: This is another output clock from the PLL, potentially having a different frequency or phase compared to `outclk_0`. This gives flexibility in managing various timing requirements within the SDRAM system.\n- `locked`: This signal indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the input reference clock, achieving stable output frequencies. It's essential for ensuring that the module only operates when the clocks are stable, thus avoiding timing errors in the SDRAM system."
