Module name: Rd_Test.

Module specification: The "Rd_Test" module implements a state machine that controls a read operation, triggered upon a button push. The module takes as inputs an iCLK signal for synchronization, an active-low iRST_n signal for initial reset, an iBUTTON for triggering read operations, an address_in designating the memory address for the read, and a readdata bus carrying the data from memory. Outputs from the module include a read control signal to initiate memory read operations, a c_state indicating the current state of the state machine, an outdata bus holding the fetched data, an outack signal confirming data readiness, a RD_LOAD that flags when a new address is loaded, and an address_out signal mirroring the input address during reads. Internally, the module uses pre_button for debouncing the button input, trigger to start a read upon the button's falling edge, the 4-bit c_state to track the state machine's states, read as an external control flag, and a write_count for timing control between read phases. The Verilog code organizes its functionality in an `always` block that responds to the positive edge of iCLK, encompassing input signal debouncing, state machine transitions including address loading, read initiation, data capture, and read acknowledgment generation via sequential case statements. The state machine resets under an active-low iRST_n signal and proceeds through predefined states to ensure proper timing and control of read operations until the final data is prepared for output.
