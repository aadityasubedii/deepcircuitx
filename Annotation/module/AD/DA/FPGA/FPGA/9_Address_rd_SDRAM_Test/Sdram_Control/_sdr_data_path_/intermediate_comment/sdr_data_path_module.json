    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdr_data_path` module manages the data flow to SDRAM by directly passing input data `DATAIN` to output `DQOUT` and controls byte-wise masking through `DQM`. On reset, `DQM` is set to mask all bits. Otherwise, it adopts the `DM` input's mask settings, all synchronized to the `CLK`."
