Module name: `sdram_pll0_0002`. Module specification: The `sdram_pll0_0002` is a Verilog module designed to instantiate a phase-locked loop (PLL) specifically tailored for SDRAM applications, utilizing an Altera-specific PLL block. The module is responsible for generating two 100 MHz clocks from a 50 MHz reference clock. The input ports `refclk` and `rst` serve as the reference clock and reset for the PLL respectively; `refclk` provides the base timing source, while `rst` is used to reinitialize the PLL during errors or startup. The output ports `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` deliver the generated clocks with corresponding phase shifts—`outclk_0` is phase-aligned to the reference, and `outclk_1` is phase-shifted by -3000 ps. Both output clocks maintain a 50% duty cycle. The `locked` output indicates when the PLL has locked onto the reference clock and is providing stable output frequencies. Internally, the module defines `fboutclk` and `fbclk` as signals related to the PLL feedback mechanism; however, `fboutclk` has no external connections in this instance and `fbclk` is tied to ground. The code within the module is primarily orchestration and parameterization of the `altera_pll` instance, configuring this component with specifics such as the number of clocks, their frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles. It also connects the input and output signals appropriately to the Altera-specific PLL block, thereby shaping the PLL’s behavior to the desired specifications.
