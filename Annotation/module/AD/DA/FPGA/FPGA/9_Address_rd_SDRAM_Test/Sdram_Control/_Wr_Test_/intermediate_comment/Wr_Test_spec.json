    "spec": "Module name: Wr_Test. Module specification: The `Wr_Test` module is designed to facilitate the testing of write and read operations in a memory system. The functionality revolves around a state-controlled test that utilizes input output signals and internal registers to perform operations and status checks. The input ports include `iCLK` (the clock signal), `iRST_n` (active-low reset signal), `iBUTTON` (user-trigger input), and `readdata` (data read from memory). The output ports comprise `write` (activates write operations), `writedata` (data to write to memory), `read` (activates read operations), `drv_status_pass` (indicates all tests passed), `drv_status_fail` (indicates a test failure), `drv_status_test_complete` (signals completion of the testing protocol), `same` (compares read data against expected data), and `c_state` (state of the test FSM). Internal signals like `pre_button` (for edge detection on `iBUTTON`), `trigger` (indicates a button press event), `c_state` (current state of FSM), and others including `write`, `read`, `address`, `writedata`, `write_count`, `max_address`, and `data` serve critical functions such as managing the FSM, data control, and address management. The code blocks include initialization routines, state transition mechanisms, write/data management operations, and read/compare modules. Each is crucial for the automated testing and validation of memory operations based on edge-triggered inputs and sequential logic determined by the FSM.",

It interfaces with a `rom_test` instance for accessing reference data. The module generates write and read signals and checks whether the data read from the address space matches the expected data from the `rom_test` instance. The module works through a state machine, with states for setting up the address, writing data, incrementing the address, reading data back, and comparing it for equality. The outputs `drv_status_pass`, `drv_status_fail`, and `drv_status_test_complete` are used to indicate the status of the test, whether it passed, failed, or completed.

                    "text": "Module name: Wr_Test. Module specification: The `Wr_Test` module is designed to facilitate the testing of write and read operations in a memory system. The functionality revolves around a state-controlled test that utilizes input output signals and internal registers to perform operations and status checks. The input ports include `iCLK` (the clock signal), `iRST_n` (active-low reset signal), `iBUTTON` (user-trigger input), and `readdata` (data read from memory). The output ports comprise `write` (activates write operations), `writedata` (data to write to memory), `read` (activates read operations), `drv_status_pass` (indicates all tests passed), `drv_status_fail` (indicates a test failure), `drv_status_test_complete` (signals completion of the testing protocol), `same` (compares read data against expected data), and `c_state` (state of the test FSM). Internal signals like `pre_button` (for edge detection on `iBUTTON`), `trigger` (indicates a button press event), `c_state` (current state of FSM), and others including `write`, `read`, `address`, `writedata`, `write_count`, `max_address`, and `data` serve critical functions such as managing the FSM, data control, and address management. The code blocks include initialization routines, state transition mechanisms, write/data management operations, and read/compare modules. Each is crucial for the automated testing and validation of memory operations based on edge-triggered inputs and sequential logic determined by the FSM."
