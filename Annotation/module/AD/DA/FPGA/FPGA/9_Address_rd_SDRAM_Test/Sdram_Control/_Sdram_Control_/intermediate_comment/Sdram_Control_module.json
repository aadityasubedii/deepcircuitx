    "module": "Module-level comment: The Sdram_Control module manages memory operations for SDRAM, interfacing with system bus commands to read/write data. It handles initialization, timing, and data buffering using internal registers, state machines, and FIFOs. SDRAM commands are generated based on operation requests, and data is transferred through a controlled datapath, all synchronized by an internal PLL-generated clock."
