Module-level comment: The `sdram_pll0_0002` module implements a PLL for SDRAM, generating two 100 MHz clocks from a 50 MHz reference. Utilizes Altera-specific PLL instantiation with one clock phase-aligned and the other shifted by -3000 ps. Inputs include `refclk` and `rst` for initialization and control, while outputs are two clocks and a `locked` status signal. Configuration is achieved via parameterized `altera_pll` instance, aligning with specific operational requirements.
