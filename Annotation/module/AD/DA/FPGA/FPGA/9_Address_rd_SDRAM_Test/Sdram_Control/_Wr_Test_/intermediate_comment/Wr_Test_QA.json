It interfaces with a `rom_test` instance for accessing reference data. The module generates write and read signals and checks whether the data read from the address space matches the expected data from the `rom_test` instance. The module works through a state machine, with states for setting up the address, writing data, incrementing the address, reading data back, and comparing it for equality. The outputs `drv_status_pass`, `drv_status_fail`, and `drv_status_test_complete` are used to indicate the status of the test, whether it passed, failed, or completed. The `c_state` output signifies the current state of the test state machine."
