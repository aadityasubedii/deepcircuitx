Module name: sdram_pll0.
Module specification: The `sdram_pll0` module serves as a clock management component in an SDRAM system, generating different clock frequencies from a reference clock and providing a locked signal to indicate stable frequency output. It encompasses two input ports: `refclk`, which is the reference clock input for the PLL and forms the base timing for output generation, and `rst`, which is the reset signal enabling the PLL to initialize or recover from error states. The module provides three output ports: `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` for different clock outputs tailored for the SDRAM subsystem's timing needs, and `locked` which signifies the successful locking of the PLL to the reference signal. Internally, the module does not define any signals but instantiates the component `sdram_pll0_0002` with the mentioned I/O directly connected to it, suggesting that the `sdram_pll0` acts as a structural wrapper responsible for interfacing rather than containing any additional logic processing. In terms of code structure, the module is encased within a `timescale` directive ensuring the simulation operates at a picosecond precision and consists of the module definition, the instantiation of the internal PLL component, and the module termination without additional internal blocks or further signal processing.
