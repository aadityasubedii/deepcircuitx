    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"Rd_Test\" module is a state machine-driven read controller, activated by a button press to perform memory read operations. It uses input and output ports for address and data handling, internal signals for state management and timing, and processes events in synchronized blocks dictated by state transitions from a reset state, through loading, reading, and output stages, ensuring proper data acquisition and signaling upon completion."
