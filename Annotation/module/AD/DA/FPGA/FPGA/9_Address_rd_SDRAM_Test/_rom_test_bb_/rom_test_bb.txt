Module-level comment: The 'rom_test' module is designed for ROM data read operations, synchronized by a clock. It takes a 16-bit 'address' to select ROM data, outputting the data on a 16-bit 'q'. The current implementation lacks internal memory and logic, primarily serving as a structural template with technology-specific considerations for Altera FPGAs, indicated by `tri1` clock and conditional preprocessor blocks.
