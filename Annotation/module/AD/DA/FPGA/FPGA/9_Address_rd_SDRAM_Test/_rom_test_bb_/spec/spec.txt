Module name: rom_test. Module specification: The 'rom_test' module is presumably a template for a read-only memory (ROM) test module, which is, however, not fully implemented in the provided code snippet. This module is intended to support reading operations from a ROM, synchronized by an input clock. The module is defined with two input ports and one output port. The 'address' input is a 16-bit wide signal intended to select the memory location from which data is to be read. The 'clock' input is meant to synchronize the read operation; unusually, 'clock' is also declared as `tri1`, leading to a weak pull-up behavior when left unconnected, which is atypical for clock signals and suggests technology-specific design considerations, perhaps for Altera FPGA devices. The 'q' output is also 16-bit wide and is intended to output the data read from the ROM at the specified address. No internal signals are defined or used in the provided code snippet, indicating that the major ROM functionalities such as memory storage and data retrieval logic are not contained in the given code. Additionally, the code contains two empty conditional preprocessing blocks checking for `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS`, which do not contribute any logic or configuration but typically guard against name conflicts with Altera FPGA tool-specific keywords. The module lacks any internal architecture and operational logic and serves as a shell for what would be a ROM test structure.
