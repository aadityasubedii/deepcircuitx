Module name: seven_segment_LED.
Module specification: The 'seven_segment_LED' module is responsible for controlling a series of six 7-segment LED displays. It accepts a 20-bit input 'num', which denotes a numerical value, and converts this into individual digits that are then displayed on each of the six LED displays labeled 'HEX5' to 'HEX0'. The module functions in sync with a clock signal 'clk' and features an active low asynchronous reset 'rst_n'. Upon a reset command, all LED outputs are cleared to zero. The module contains an internal 20-bit register 'lnum' that captures and holds the value of 'num' at the rising edge of 'clk' or on the falling edge of 'rst_n'. The core of the module employs a parameter 'ctable' that stores bit patterns for the decimal digits 0-9, utilized for decoding each digit of the input 'num' into its corresponding 7-segment LED representation. The internal always block activates either at a clock's positive edge or a reset's negative edge, updating the 'lnum' and setting the LED outputs to the decoded seven-segment values from 'ctable'. Each output register, 'HEX0' through 'HEX5', corresponds to a digit of the value 'num', with 'HEX0' showing the least significant digit and 'HEX5' showing the most significant. The output encoding utilizes part-selects from 'ctable' to assign the 7-bit segment patterns for generating the desired numeral on the displays.
