    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pll_test' module encapsulates a PLL component 'pll_test_0002', forwarding 'refclk' and 'rst' inputs directly to generate 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1' outputs. It serves as an interface for clock management, with no internal logic beyond signal connections to the instantiated PLL."
