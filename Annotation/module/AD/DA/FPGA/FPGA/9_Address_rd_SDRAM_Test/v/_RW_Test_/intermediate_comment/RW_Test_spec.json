    "spec": "Module name: RW_Test.\n\nModule specification: The RW_Test module is designed to simulate a write-read test on a memory interface, employing a unique data generation strategy to verify the memory's operational accuracy. This module is activated by an `iBUTTON` input trigger and operates under the control of a clock signal, `iCLK`, with an active-low reset, `iRST_n`. The input and output ports include the clock (`iCLK`), reset (`iRST_n`), and button (`iBUTTON`) inputs, along with output signals for write (`write`), read (`read`), written data (`writedata`), test completion status (`drv_status_pass`, `drv_status_fail`, `drv_status_test_complete`), and a comparison signal (`same`) and current state output (`c_state`). The internal signals such as `pre_button`, `trigger`, `write_count`, `address`, along with data generation variables like `cal_data`, `clk_cnt`, `max_address`, `y0`, `y1`, `y2`, `z`, and `y` facilitate the core logic, including data pattern generation and memory address progression. The code block structure organizes the module's functionality into sections concerning reset and initialization, state machine progression for write and read operations, data generation, and status signal determination. These blocks manage the transition through various operational states\u2014from initialization to data writing, reading, comparison, and finally, status indication upon completion of the test sequence, ensuring a coherent and systematic approach to memory testing.",

It initializes by waiting for a trigger event signaled by an input button (`iBUTTON`). Upon this trigger, it commences a patterned sequence of operations distinguished by a finite-state machine. The sequence begins by writing generated data (`y`) to consecutive memory addresses until a defined maximum address is reached, signifying the switch to the read phase. During the read phase, it compares the readback data (`readdata`) against the expected data (`writedata`). This process assesses the memory operation's correctness throughout its addressable space. The module indicates the test's outcome through status signals: `drv_status_pass`, `drv_status_fail`, and `drv_status_test_complete`, based on whether the read data matches the expected patterns across the entire memory space. The test strives to cover all addresses (`max_address`), sequentially incrementing the memory address and recalculating data to write or compare against, influenced by an internally generated `cal_data` and the current memory `address`. The core logic is clock-driven (`iCLK`), with a reset functionality (`iRST_n`) initializing the internal states and counters for a clean start or restart of the write-read test sequence."

It drives the state machine and sequential logic, ensuring synchronization of operations.\n- **iRST_n**: This is the active-low reset input. It initializes the internal states, counters, and outputs to their default values, preparing the module for operation.\n- **iBUTTON**: This input is used as a trigger to start the write-read test sequence. A change in its state (from high to low) signals the module to commence the test operation.\n\n### Output Ports:\n- **write**: This signal indicates when the module is in a write operation mode. It is asserted (high) to enable writing data to the memory.\n- **writedata**: This output port carries the data to be written to memory during the write phase. It generates unique data for each memory address based on internal calculations.\n- **read**: This signal is asserted (high) during the read operation mode, enabling the reading of data from the memory.\n- **readdata**: Although not an output port, it's essential to note that this is an input port carrying the data read from memory during the read phase, for completeness.\n- **drv_status_pass**: This signal is asserted (high) if the readback data matches the expected patterns across the entire memory space, indicating a successful memory operation.\n- **drv_status_fail**: This output is asserted (high) if any discrepancy is found between the readback and expected data, indicating a failure in the memory operation.\n- **drv_status_test_complete**: This signal indicates the completion of the test sequence. It is asserted (high) when either a pass or fail status is determined.\n- **same**: This signal indicates whether the last read data matches the expected data. It is used internally for decision-making within the state machine but is also available externally for observation.\n- **c_state**: This 4-bit output represents the current state of the internal finite state machine controlling the module's operation.\n\nEach input and output port plays a crucial role in facilitating and monitoring the module's operation, ensuring a coherent flow for the memory write-read test process."

It retains the last two states of `iBUTTON`, assisting in the detection of a button press event (trigger).\n\n2. **trigger**: This signal gets asserted when there is a falling edge on the `iBUTTON` (detected from `pre_button`). It acts as the condition to start the write phase of the memory testing process.\n\n3. **write_count**: This 5-bit register counts cycles within specific states, primarily utilized to delay actions within those states (e.g., stabilizing data patterns before writing).\n\n4. **address**: This register holds the current memory address, which the data is being written to or read from. It increments sequentially until it reaches the maximum address where it resets.\n\n5. **cal_data**: Represents calculated data based on the current clock cycle count at the time of a write operation initiation. This data influences the unique data pattern generated for writing to memory.\n\n6. **clk_cnt**: A 32-bit counter that increments with every clock cycle. It is used for various timing and data generation purposes within the module (e.g., seed for `cal_data`).\n\n7. **max_address**: A wire that indicates whether the current memory `address` has reached its maximum value, signaling transitions between major phases (write-to-read, or completion of tests).\n\n8. **y0, y1, y2**: These wires are intermediate values generated during the computation of the `writedata`. They manipulate bits of `cal_data` and `address` in various ways to produce a unique, testable pattern for memory operations.\n\n9. **z**: An 8-bit intermediate value derived from specific bits of `y1` and `y2`. It is used to construct the final data pattern written to the memory.\n\n10. **y**: The final output data pattern (16 bits used as `writedata`) computed from bits of `y2`, `z`, and `y1`. This data is written to memory during the write phase and expected during the read phase for verification.\n\nThese internal signals are fundamental for controlling the operational logic of the module, managing data flow, and enabling the state machine to transition through its phases accordingly."

This module is activated by an `iBUTTON` input trigger and operates under the control of a clock signal, `iCLK`, with an active-low reset, `iRST_n`. The input and output ports include the clock (`iCLK`), reset (`iRST_n`), and button (`iBUTTON`) inputs, along with output signals for write (`write`), read (`read`), written data (`writedata`), test completion status (`drv_status_pass`, `drv_status_fail`, `drv_status_test_complete`), and a comparison signal (`same`) and current state output (`c_state`). The internal signals such as `pre_button`, `trigger`, `write_count`, `address`, along with data generation variables like `cal_data`, `clk_cnt`, `max_address`, `y0`, `y1`, `y2`, `z`, and `y` facilitate the core logic, including data pattern generation and memory address progression. The code block structure organizes the module's functionality into sections concerning reset and initialization, state machine progression for write and read operations, data generation, and status signal determination. These blocks manage the transition through various operational states\u2014from initialization to data writing, reading, comparison, and finally, status indication upon completion of the test sequence, ensuring a coherent and systematic approach to memory testing."
