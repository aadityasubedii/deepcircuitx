Module name: pll_test_0002. Module specification: The `pll_test_0002` module interfaces with an Altera Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) IP core, primarily designed to generate two distinct output clock frequencies from a given reference clock. Input ports include `refclk`, the primary reference clock signal for the PLL, and `rst`, which is used to reset the internal state of the PLL. The output ports consist of `outclk_0` and `outclk_1`, providing clock signals at 100 MHz and 200 MHz, respectively, and `locked`, which indicates whether the PLL has achieved a stable and accurate lock on the desired frequencies. Internally, the module utilizes two signals: `fboutclk` for potential feedback purposes, though it remains unconnected, and `fbclk`, which is tied to a constant low indicating no external feedback is used by the PLL. The Verilog code is mainly structured around the instantiation of the `altera_pll` IP, where specific parameters like the number of clocks, their frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles are meticulously configured to achieve the desired output clock characteristics. Post parameters setup, the component connections define how the input and output signals are interfaced with the PLL core to maintain synchronization and proper functionality of the module.
