Module-level comment: The RW_Test module performs a memory write-read verification test. On receiving a start trigger via `iBUTTON`, it executes a state-machine-driven sequence, generating unique data with `cal_data` and sequentially writing to and reading from memory addresses. Outputs like `write`, `read`, and `writedata` manage memory interactions, with `drv_status_*` indicating test results. The module resets with `iRST_n` and synchronizes operations to `iCLK`, ensuring reliable memory validation.
