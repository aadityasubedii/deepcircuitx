    "spec": "Module name: seven_segment_LED.\nModule specification: The 'seven_segment_LED' module is responsible for controlling a series of six 7-segment LED displays. It accepts a 20-bit input 'num', which denotes a numerical value, and converts this into individual digits that are then displayed on each of the six LED displays labeled 'HEX5' to 'HEX0'. The module functions in sync with a clock signal 'clk' and features an active low asynchronous reset 'rst_n'. Upon a reset command, all LED outputs are cleared to zero. The module contains an internal 20-bit register 'lnum' that captures and holds the value of 'num' at the rising edge of 'clk' or on the falling edge of 'rst_n'. The core of the module employs a parameter 'ctable' that stores bit patterns for the decimal digits 0-9, utilized for decoding each digit of the input 'num' into its corresponding 7-segment LED representation. The internal always block activates either at a clock's positive edge or a reset's negative edge, updating the 'lnum' and setting the LED outputs to the decoded seven-segment values from 'ctable'. Each output register, 'HEX0' through 'HEX5', corresponds to a digit of the value 'num', with 'HEX0' showing the least significant digit and 'HEX5' showing the most significant. The output encoding utilizes part-selects from 'ctable' to assign the 7-bit segment patterns for generating the desired numeral on the displays.",

It takes a 20-bit input 'num', which represents a numerical value, and then divides and decodes this value into individual digits to be displayed on each of the six 7-segment LED displays 'HEX5' to 'HEX0'. The module operates synchronously with respect to a provided clock signal 'clk' and can be asynchronously reset via the active low 'rst_n' input. When reset, all the LED display outputs are cleared to zero. If not reset, the module uses a pre-defined parameter 'ctable' that appears to contain the segment control codes for the decimal digits 0 to 9, and it appropriately assigns these codes to the six display registers based on the current value of 'num', essentially converting each digit of the number into a displayable format for the 7-segment LEDs."

The internal processes of updating the display outputs are triggered on the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- 'num' is a 20-bit input representing the numeric value to be displayed across the six 7-segment LED displays. This number is split into individual digits which are then decoded for display.\n\nOutput ports: HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, HEX3, HEX4, HEX5. Explanation:\n- 'HEX0' to 'HEX5' are 7-bit output registers connected to six 7-segment displays, with HEX0 being the least significant digit and HEX5 being the most significant digit. These outputs receive segment control codes that dictate which segments of the 7-segment display are illuminated to represent the appropriate digits of the 'num' input after decoding.
