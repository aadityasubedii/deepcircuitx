Module name: pll_test.
Module specification: The 'pll_test' module is a simple wrapper for a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) component named 'pll_test_0002'. Its primary function is to provide a clock management interface whereby it receives an input reference clock ('refclk') and a reset signal ('rst') to produce two distinct frequency-adjusted clock outputs ('outclk_0' and 'outclk_1'). The input ports include 'refclk', which serves as the base clock for the PLL, and 'rst', which is used to reset the PLL to a known initial state. The output ports are 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1', which are the two adjusted clock signals emanating from the PLL. There are no internal signals explicitly defined or utilized within the module; all signals directly interface with the 'pll_test_0002' instance without additional handling. The module code consists of the `timescale directive that defines the time unit and precision for the simulation, the module declaration with its ports, the instantiation of the 'pll_test_0002' component that maps the input and output signals, and the stub for the 'locked' signal that is left unconnected. This arrangement indicates no internal logic or signal processing occurs within the 'pll_test' module, and its role is primarily to relay signals to and from the 'pll_test_0002' instantiated block.
