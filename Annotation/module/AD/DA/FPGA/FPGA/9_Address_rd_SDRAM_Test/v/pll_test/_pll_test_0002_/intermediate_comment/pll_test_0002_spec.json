Module specification: The `pll_test_0002` module interfaces with an Altera Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) IP core, primarily designed to generate two distinct output clock frequencies from a given reference clock. Input ports include `refclk`, the primary reference clock signal for the PLL, and `rst`, which is used to reset the internal state of the PLL. The output ports consist of `outclk_0` and `outclk_1`, providing clock signals at 100 MHz and 200 MHz, respectively, and `locked`, which indicates whether the PLL has achieved a stable and accurate lock on the desired frequencies. Internally, the module utilizes two signals: `fboutclk` for potential feedback purposes, though it remains unconnected, and `fbclk`, which is tied to a constant low indicating no external feedback is used by the PLL. The Verilog code is mainly structured around the instantiation of the `altera_pll` IP, where specific parameters like the number of clocks, their frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles are meticulously configured to achieve the desired output clock characteristics. Post parameters setup, the component connections define how the input and output signals are interfaced with the PLL core to maintain synchronization and proper functionality of the module.",

The purpose of this module is to generate two output clocks, `outclk_0` and `outclk_1`, from a reference clock `refclk`. The PLL IP core is configured with several parameters to set the frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles of the output clocks. According to the parameter settings, `outclk_0` is configured to have a frequency of 100 MHz, and `outclk_1` is set to 200 MHz, with both having phase shifts of 0 ps and duty cycles of 50%. The input `rst` is a reset signal that is passed to the PLL core to reset the internal states if required. The `locked` output signal indicates whether the PLL has achieved and is maintaining the desired frequency lock. The unused parameters in the instantiation suggest capability for more output clocks, but they are configured to \"0 MHz\" and likely left for possible future expansion or customization."

Explanation: \n- `refclk` (reference clock): This input port is the fundamental clock source for the PLL from which the output clocks are derived. It serves as the input frequency that the PLL will multiply or divide to generate the desired output clock frequencies.\n- `rst` (reset): This input is used to reset the internal state of the PLL. Applying a reset signal (typically high) initializes or reinitializes the PLL, which is crucial during startup or if the system requires re-synchronization.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, outclk_1, locked. Explanation:\n- `outclk_0`: This output port provides a clock signal with a frequency of 100 MHz. It's one of the primary clock outputs generated by multiplying/dividing the input reference clock based on the PLL configuration.\n- `outclk_1`: This output port provides a clock signal with a frequency of 200 MHz. Similar to `outclk_0`, it is generated from the `refclk` but configured to a different frequency to satisfy different timing requirements in the system.\n- `locked`: This signal is an output that indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the desired frequency. A high signal typically means that the PLL output is stable and locked, ensuring reliable operation of downstream circuits synchronized by `outclk_0` and `outclk_1`."

In the given code, this signal doesn't appear to be used explicitly, as it is left unconnected (indicated by `()`).\n- `fbclk` (Feedback Clock): This signal is similar in purpose to `fboutclk` but is explicitly set to a constant '0' (`1'b0`) in the instantiation. This configuration generally implies that feedback is not utilized, or the feedback mechanism is internally managed in a fixed manner by the PLL configuration, thus not requiring external input."
