    "spec": "Module name: pll_test.\nModule specification: The 'pll_test' module is a simple wrapper for a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) component named 'pll_test_0002'. Its primary function is to provide a clock management interface whereby it receives an input reference clock ('refclk') and a reset signal ('rst') to produce two distinct frequency-adjusted clock outputs ('outclk_0' and 'outclk_1'). The input ports include 'refclk', which serves as the base clock for the PLL, and 'rst', which is used to reset the PLL to a known initial state. The output ports are 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1', which are the two adjusted clock signals emanating from the PLL. There are no internal signals explicitly defined or utilized within the module; all signals directly interface with the 'pll_test_0002' instance without additional handling. The module code consists of the `timescale directive that defines the time unit and precision for the simulation, the module declaration with its ports, the instantiation of the 'pll_test_0002' component that maps the input and output signals, and the stub for the 'locked' signal that is left unconnected. This arrangement indicates no internal logic or signal processing occurs within the 'pll_test' module, and its role is primarily to relay signals to and from the 'pll_test_0002' instantiated block.",

It is designed to take an input reference clock signal ('refclk') and a reset signal ('rst'). It generates two output clock signals ('outclk_0' and 'outclk_1'). The exact functionality of the PLL, such as frequency multiplication or division, phase adjustment, or duty cycle correction, is not specified in the given code and would likely be defined within the 'pll_test_0002' module. There is also an output for 'locked', which is used as an indicator that the PLL has achieved lock to the input reference clock, although in this code snippet the 'locked' signal is not connected to an output port. The `timescale directive specifies the time unit and time precision for the simulation of this module, which is set to 1 picosecond (ps) units and precision."

It serves as the base clock from which the PLL generates its output clocks. The PLL will lock onto this clock and produce frequency-adjusted clocks as outputs based on its internal configuration.\n- rst: This is the reset input. When asserted, it initializes or resets the internal state of the PLL. A reset is typically used to bring the PLL into a known state, possibly to recover from an error state or to prepare the PLL for operation upon startup.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, outclk_1.\nExplanation: \n- outclk_0: This is one of the output clock signals generated by the PLL. It is likely a clock that has been adjusted in terms of frequency, phase, or other parameters as compared to the refclk.\n- outclk_1: This is a second output clock signal from the PLL, independently adjusted from outclk_0 and the refclk, based on the PLL's configuration.\n\nNote: The 'locked' signal is also part of the interface to the pll_test_0002 instance inside the module. However, it is not connected to an output port of the pll_test module itself and therefore is not listed here as an input or output port of the 'pll_test' module.
