It takes a 20-bit input 'num', which represents a numerical value, and then divides and decodes this value into individual digits to be displayed on each of the six 7-segment LED displays 'HEX5' to 'HEX0'. The module operates synchronously with respect to a provided clock signal 'clk' and can be asynchronously reset via the active low 'rst_n' input. When reset, all the LED display outputs are cleared to zero. If not reset, the module uses a pre-defined parameter 'ctable' that appears to contain the segment control codes for the decimal digits 0 to 9, and it appropriately assigns these codes to the six display registers based on the current value of 'num', essentially converting each digit of the number into a displayable format for the 7-segment LEDs."

When this input is low, it resets the output of all six 7-segment displays to zero, clearing any previously displayed values.\n- 'clk' is the clock input that synchronizes the operation of the module. The internal processes of updating the display outputs are triggered on the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- 'num' is a 20-bit input representing the numeric value to be displayed across the six 7-segment LED displays. This number is split into individual digits which are then decoded for display.\n\nOutput ports: HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, HEX3, HEX4, HEX5. Explanation:\n- 'HEX0' to 'HEX5' are 7-bit output registers connected to six 7-segment displays, with HEX0 being the least significant digit and HEX5 being the most significant digit. These outputs receive segment control codes that dictate which segments of the 7-segment display are illuminated to represent the appropriate digits of the 'num' input after decoding. When the module is reset, all outputs are set to zero."
