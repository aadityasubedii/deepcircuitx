Module name: RW_Test.

Module specification: The RW_Test module is designed to simulate a write-read test on a memory interface, employing a unique data generation strategy to verify the memory's operational accuracy. This module is activated by an `iBUTTON` input trigger and operates under the control of a clock signal, `iCLK`, with an active-low reset, `iRST_n`. The input and output ports include the clock (`iCLK`), reset (`iRST_n`), and button (`iBUTTON`) inputs, along with output signals for write (`write`), read (`read`), written data (`writedata`), test completion status (`drv_status_pass`, `drv_status_fail`, `drv_status_test_complete`), and a comparison signal (`same`) and current state output (`c_state`). The internal signals such as `pre_button`, `trigger`, `write_count`, `address`, along with data generation variables like `cal_data`, `clk_cnt`, `max_address`, `y0`, `y1`, `y2`, `z`, and `y` facilitate the core logic, including data pattern generation and memory address progression. The code block structure organizes the module's functionality into sections concerning reset and initialization, state machine progression for write and read operations, data generation, and status signal determination. These blocks manage the transition through various operational statesâ€”from initialization to data writing, reading, comparison, and finally, status indication upon completion of the test sequence, ensuring a coherent and systematic approach to memory testing.
