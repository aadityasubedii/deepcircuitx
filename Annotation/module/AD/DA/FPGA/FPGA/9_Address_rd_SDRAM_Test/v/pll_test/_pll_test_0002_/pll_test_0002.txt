Module-level comment: The `pll_test_0002` module interfaces with an Altera PLL to generate two clocks (100 MHz & 200 MHz) from a reference. It instantiates the `altera_pll` IP with precise frequency, phase, and duty cycle settings for the output clocks and provides reset handling and lock status indication. No external feedback is used in this configuration.
