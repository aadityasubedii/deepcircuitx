Module-level comment: The 'rom_test' module implements a 16-bit read-only memory using Intel's 'altsyncram' block. It reads data synchronized with a clock signal based on a 16-bit address input. The module outputs the data at the address edge of the clock without write capability. Internal 'sub_wire0' serves as the conduit between 'altsyncram_component' and the output 'q'. Parameters define ROM operation and initial content configured for Cyclone V FPGA devices.
