    "spec": "Module name: rom_test.\n\nModule specification: The 'rom_test' module encapsulates a read-only memory (ROM) functionality, leveraging the 'altsyncram' primitive from Intel (originally Altera) tailored for the Cyclone V FPGA family. The module's operation revolves around a 16-bit wide address bus ('address') that selects data from the ROM and a clock signal ('clock') that synchronizes the data retrieval process. Upon the rising edge of the clock, the data from the addressed memory location is presented on a 16-bit wide output ('q'). The module lacks write capability, evidenced by disabled write enable signals. Internally, a wire named 'sub_wire0' channels the output from 'altsyncram_component' into the 'q' output port after the address-based data selection.\n\nThe code is segmented into port declarations, internal signal definitions, instance creation of 'altsyncram_component', and parameter settings. The ports include a 16-bit 'address' and 'clock' as inputs, and a 16-bit 'q' as an output. Notable internal signals include 'sub_wire0', which serves as an intermediary for the data flowing from 'altsyncram_component' to the 'q' output. The 'altsyncram_component' instance gets parameterized to specify ROM behavior, initial memory content from a '.mif' file, and other operational modes. Also, there are provisions for defining synthesis attributes like 'tri1' for the clock, which are tool-specific signals or settings, but in this code, these attributes are left undefined (`ifndef ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS` sections have no content). The defparam block sets various configuration options for the ROM such as disabling asynchronous clear signals, bypassing clock enable inputs, defining the initial content file, specifying the intended device family, and setting the register mode for the ROM's read operation, adhering to the explained functionality.",

The module has a 16-bit address input and a 16-bit data output. It is triggered by a clock signal. Upon each clock edge, the data at the given address is presented on the output 'q'. This module does not support write operations, as indicated by 'wren_a' and 'wren_b' being tied to 0. The various parameters of the 'altsyncram_component' are configured to specify that this is a ROM with a memory initialization file 'test.mif', and it is intended for use with the 'Cyclone V' family of FPGA devices. It does not allow for runtime modification ('ENABLE_RUNTIME_MOD=NO') and has its outputs registered to the rising edge of 'clock0'.
