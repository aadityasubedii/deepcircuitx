Module name: DE0_CV_SDRAM_RTL_Test. Module specification: The `DE0_CV_SDRAM_RTL_Test` module is designed for testing the SDRAM on a DE0-CV FPGA board by performing write and read operations. It uses multiple clock inputs (`CLOCK2_50, CLOCK3_50, CLOCK4_50, CLOCK_50`) for various timing and control purposes with `CLOCK_50` primarily used to drive the SDRAM control signals through the SDRAM control submodule. The input `KEY` embraces push buttons for reset and test functionalities, while `RESET_N` serves for initializing the module. Outputs include SDRAM control (`DRAM_ADDR, DRAM_BA, DRAM_CAS_N` etc.), VGA outputs (`VGA_B, VGA_G, VGA_R, VGA_HS, VGA_VS`), seven-segment display outputs (`HEX0` to `HEX5`) for result display, and LED outputs (`LEDR`) for indicating test results and operational status. Internal signals such as `writedata`, `readdata`, `write`, `read_wr`, and `read_rd` manage data flow and read/write operations controlled by test sequences. The module incorporates key submodules: `Sdram_Control` for interfacing with the SDRAM, `Wr_Test` and `Rd_Test` for handling write and read test logic, a `pll_test` for clock management, and `seven_segment_LED` for displaying data on the seven-segment LED displays. A series of signal samples and counters (`sample`, `sample_1`, `cont`, `heart_beat`) manage button debouncing and provide operational timing for resets and test starts. The combination of these elements provides a comprehensive environment for SDRAM testing and result validation on the DE0-CV development board.
