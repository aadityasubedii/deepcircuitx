Module-level comment: The `DE0_CV_SDRAM_RTL_Test` module tests SDRAM functionality on a DE0-CV FPGA board by executing write/read operations. It utilizes multiple 50 MHz clocks, input buttons (`KEY`), and switches (`SW`) for user control, interfacing with SDRAM via `Sdram_Control`, and displaying test results on LEDs and seven-segment displays. Internal logic includes write/read test submodules (`Wr_Test`, `Rd_Test`), PLL for clock generation (`pll_test`), and signal sampling for button debouncing, orchestrated to validate SDRAM operations efficiently.
