It appears there is a misunderstanding. The Verilog code you provided in your recent message is still corrupted or encoded incorrectly, and it is not valid Verilog syntax. Since the text consists of non-printable characters and symbols, it is impossible to derive a meaningful specification for a Verilog module. 

In order to generate a specification, I would need correctly formatted Verilog code that includes the module declaration, port definitions, signal declarations, and the logic within the module. This code would need to be in ASCII or UTF-8 text encoding, which are standard for text files and code.

If you can provide a proper Verilog RTL code snippet, I can create a detailed specification based on the information such as the module name, its functionality, the input and output ports, internal signals, and an overview of the code blocks.

Please provide valid Verilog RTL code, and I'll be glad to assist you in generating a detailed specification for the module.
