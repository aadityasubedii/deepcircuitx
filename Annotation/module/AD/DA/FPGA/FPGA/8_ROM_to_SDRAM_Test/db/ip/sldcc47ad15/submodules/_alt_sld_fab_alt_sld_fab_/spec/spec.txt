I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The "original Verilog code" you shared appears to be heavily corrupted or encrypted, containing mostly non-readable characters and symbols rather than valid Verilog RTL code. 

Without access to readable, valid Verilog code, it's not possible to accurately determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure. To provide a meaningful specification, I would need clear, uncorrupted Verilog RTL code.

If you have access to the actual, readable Verilog code for this module, please provide it, and I'd be happy to analyze it and generate a detailed specification as requested. The specification would include the module name, functionality explanation, input/output ports with explanations, internal signals with their purposes, and an overview of the code structure and functions.
