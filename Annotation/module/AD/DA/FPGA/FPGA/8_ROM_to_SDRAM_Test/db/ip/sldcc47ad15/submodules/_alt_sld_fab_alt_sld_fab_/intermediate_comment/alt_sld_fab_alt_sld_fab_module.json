Clear, readable Verilog RTL code for the module\n2. A valid detailed specification based on that code\n\nIf you have access to the actual, uncorrupted Verilog code for this module and its corresponding specification, please provide them. With that information, I'd be happy to generate a concise module-level comment that accurately describes the module's functionality and implementation details."
