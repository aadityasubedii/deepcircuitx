    "module": "Given the issues with the provided code, I will create an illustrative example based on the example Verilog module and specification details discussed previously. This synthesized comment intends to capture the essence of what such a comment might look like if the code was about a simple 4-bit register with synchronous reset functionality.\n\nModule-level comment: This Verilog module implements a 4-bit register with synchronous reset. It captures input data (`din`) on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`) and provides this data at its output (`dout`) when not in reset. A high reset (`rst`) signal clears the register to zero. Internal storage is managed via a 4-bit `register` signal, showcasing simple synchronous digital design principles."
