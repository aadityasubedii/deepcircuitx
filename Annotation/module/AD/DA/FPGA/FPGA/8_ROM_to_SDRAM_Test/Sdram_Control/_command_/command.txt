Module-level comment: The `command` module controls SDRAM operations, translating input commands (read, write, refresh) into SDRAM control sequences, adhering to memory timings. It handles command processing, timing delays, and signal generation, coordinated through clocked `always` blocks that manage internal flags, acknowledge requests, and direct SDRAM bank, row, and column addressing, within synchronization constraints defined in "Sdram_Params.h".
