Module-level comment: The `control_interface` module manages command and control interactions with SDRAM, handling operations like read, write, and initialization. It sequences commands based on input signals and internal timing, employing registers for address latching (`SADDR`), command decoding (`NOP`, `READA`, `WRITEA`), and status signaling (`REF_REQ`, `INIT_REQ`, `CMD_ACK`). The module ensures proper SDRAM timing through 16-bit `timer` and `init_timer`, which govern refresh requests and initialization phases, respectively, while responding to control acknowledgments.
