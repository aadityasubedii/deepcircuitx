    "spec": "Module name: sdr_data_path\n\nModule specification: The sdr_data_path module is integral to SDRAM operations, specializing in data handling by facilitating data output and control over data masking. It operates in synchronization with the system clock (CLK), ensuring proper data flow and integrity. The input port RESET_N is an active-low reset signal that sets the data mask outputs (DQM) to a high-impedance state upon a reset condition. DATAIN, a multi-bit data input, is directly passed without alteration to the DQOUT output port, serving as the module's data transmission pipeline. The DM input is a data mask signal that specifies the bits to be masked in the output data, and its value is stored and relayed to the DQM output when not in a reset state.\n\nThe only internal signal within the module is a register also named DQM, which holds the data mask value during normal operation and is initialized to all 1's, representing a high-impedance state, during a reset. \n\nThe code consists of two main blocks: an always block that determines the behavior of the DQM signal based on the clock and reset signals, and a continuous assignment (assign statement) which ensures that the input data (DATAIN) is directly mapped to the data output (DQOUT). The always block uses synchronous reset to update the DQM register with either the high-impedance state upon reset or the DM input value during normal operation. The inclusion of the \"Sdram_Params.h\" header file indicates the module's reliance on parameters defined elsewhere, likely pertaining to the data size (DSIZE), which dictates the width of the DATAIN, DQOUT, and DM ports.",

The module takes a data input (DATAIN) and a data mask input (DM), and outputs data (DQOUT) and a masked data value (DQM).

In normal operation (when RESET_N is high), DQM directly holds the value from the DM input port, effectively passing this mask to the DQM output port.
