    "module": "Module-level comment: The Sdram_Control module interfaces with SDRAM for memory operations, managing read and write commands and data synchronization. It employs REF_CLK for internal timing, handles data transfers through FIFOs, and controls SDRAM signals. Sub-modules like sdram_pll0, command1, control1, and data paths coordinate clock synchronization, command sequencing, and data flow, ensuring efficient operation and state management in sync with SDRAM protocols."
