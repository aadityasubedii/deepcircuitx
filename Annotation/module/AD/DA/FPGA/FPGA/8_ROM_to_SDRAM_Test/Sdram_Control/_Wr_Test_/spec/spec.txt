Module name: Wr_Test. 

Module specification: The Wr_Test module is designed for testing memory operations, specifically write and read functionalities, in storage systems. It operates based on a parameterized address and data width. The inputs for this module include a clock signal (iCLK) for synchronization, an active-low reset signal (iRST_n) for initialization, a button (iBUTTON) used to start the test sequence, and a read data port (readdata) for inputting data read from memory. The outputs comprise signals to control memory write (`write`) and read (`read`) operations, data to be written to the memory (`writedata`), and indicators for test pass (`drv_status_pass`), test fail (`drv_status_fail`), and test completion (`drv_status_test_complete`). Additionally, the output `same` indicates data integrity by comparing expected data with read data, and `c_state` is a 4-bit output showing the current state of the module’s state machine.

Internally, the module utilizes several signals including `pre_button` to debounce the iBUTTON input, `trigger` to initiate the memory test sequence, `write`, `read`, and `address` to control memory operations, `writedata` as the data being written to the memory, `write_count` to manage state transitions during testing, and `max_address` to indicate the reaching of the maximum address limit. The test sequence is controlled via a state machine that handles the cyclical write-read process, managing transitions based on the system state (`c_state`), write counts, and address increments, thus facilitating continuous memory verification until all allocated addresses are tested. The ROM module (`rom_test_inst`), connected through the wire `data`, supplies the expected values for this verification process.

The module systematically advances through testing states – from initialization and idle to active writing, reading, comparing data, and finally to pass/fail determination. Each state in the state machine is purposefully defined to manage the sequence of operations needed to test each aspect of the memory's functionality. The states handle instructions such as data writing, waiting counts for operation stability, address management for memory traversal, and result indication through status signals. The seamless operation of this module ensures robust verification and validation of memory integrity in testing scenarios.
