Module-level comment: The `sdram_pll0_0002` module implements a PLL for SDRAM, using an Altera PLL to generate two 100 MHz clocks with and without a -3000 ps phase shift. It maps `refclk` and `rst` inputs directly to its PLL instantiation (`altera_pll_i`), which configures operational parameters, and outputs the generated clocks and lock status.
