The module's functionality indicated by the input and output ports suggests that it generates specific clock outputs (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) from a reference clock (`refclk`) input. It also provides a `locked` output signal that indicates when the PLL has achieved phase alignment. The instantiated submodule `sdram_pll0_0002` likely contains the implementation details, such as frequency division, phase adjustments, and other PLL-specific configurations necessary for interfacing or synchronizing with SDRAM devices. The presence of a reset `rst` input allows resetting or reinitializing the PLL dynamically."

It serves as the base timing signal from which the PLL generates the required output frequencies.  \n- `rst`: This is the reset input. It is used to reset or reinitialize the PLL, ensuring that it starts in a known state or recovers from errors or phase misalignments.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`.  \nExplanation:  \n- `outclk_0`: This is one of the output clocks generated by the PLL. It is derived from the reference clock and is tailored for specific SDRAM timing requirements.\n- `outclk_1`: This is another output clock generated by the PLL. Similar to `outclk_0`, it is also derived from the reference clock and configured for different or additional timing requirements in SDRAM operations.\n- `locked`: This output signal indicates the status of the PLL.
