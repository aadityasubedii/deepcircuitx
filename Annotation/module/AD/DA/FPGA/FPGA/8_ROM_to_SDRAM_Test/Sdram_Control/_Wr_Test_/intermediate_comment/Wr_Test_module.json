    "module": "Module-level comment: The Wr_Test module automates memory operation verification by conducting sequential write and read tests. It utilizes a parameterized state machine to manage test sequences, triggered by a button press. Inputs include a clock, reset, button, and read data; outputs control memory operations and signal test status. Internal signals like pre_button, trigger, and write_count aid in debouncing, initiating, and transitioning states, ensuring robust data integrity checks across memory addresses."
