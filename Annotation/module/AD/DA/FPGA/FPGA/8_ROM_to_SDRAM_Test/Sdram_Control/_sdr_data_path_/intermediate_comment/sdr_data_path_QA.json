The module takes a data input (DATAIN) and a data mask input (DM), and outputs data (DQOUT) and a masked data value (DQM). On reset (when RESET_N is low), it initializes DQM to all 1's (high impedance state), indicating that no data bits are masked out initially. When not in reset, the module simply passes the data mask input directly to the output. This setup is useful for situations where data integrity and controlled access to data lines are critical, such as in memory interfaces."

This signal is used to reset the internal state of the module, initializing outputs to predefined values.\n- DATAIN is the data input port.

Initially, upon a negative edge of the RESET_N signal (when RESET_N is low), DQM is set to all 1's, indicating a high impedance state where no data bits are masked. This setup is meant to ensure that all bits are available and unaltered after a reset condition. In normal operation (when RESET_N is high), DQM directly holds the value from the DM input port, effectively passing this mask to the DQM output port.
