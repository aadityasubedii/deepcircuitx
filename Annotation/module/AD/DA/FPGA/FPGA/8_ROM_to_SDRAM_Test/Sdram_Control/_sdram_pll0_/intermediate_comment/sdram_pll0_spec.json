    "spec": "Module name: sdram_pll0. Module specification: The Verilog module `sdram_pll0` functions as a phase-locked loop (PLL) tailored for synchronization with SDRAM devices. It derives its output clocks `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` from a reference clock `refclk`. The `rst` input allows for resetting the PLL. The `locked` output signifies that the PLL has locked onto the reference signal and outputs are stable. The module does not define internal signals, as all logic is handled within the instantiated submodule `sdram_pll0_0002`, which presumably contains the necessary PLL configurations. The module consists of input and output declarations and a submodule instantiation that connects these ports directly. There are no additional internal blocks or sections, emphasizing a straightforward interface-oriented structure aimed at modular design and ease of integration in larger systems, such as SDRAM controllers or memory interface units.",

It is used to reset or reinitialize the PLL, ensuring that it starts in a known state or recovers from errors or phase misalignments.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`.  \nExplanation:  \n- `outclk_0`: This is one of the output clocks generated by the PLL.
