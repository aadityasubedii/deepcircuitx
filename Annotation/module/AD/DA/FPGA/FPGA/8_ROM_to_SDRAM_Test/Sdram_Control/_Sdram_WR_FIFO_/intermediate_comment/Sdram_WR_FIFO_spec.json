Module specification: The Sdram_WR_FIFO is a Verilog module designed for data buffer management in SDRAM applications, featuring a dual clock FIFO (First-In-First-Out) system that facilitates data handling between different clock domains. It specifically caters to Cyclone V FPGA designs and utilizes M10K memory blocks. The module includes input ports such as aclr (asynchronous clear), data (16-bit input data bus), rdclk (read clock), rdreq (read request), wrclk (write clock), and wrreq (write request) to manage data flow and control signals. The output ports include q (16-bit output data bus), rdempty (flags when read buffer is empty), rdusedw (9-bit output showing stored word count in read buffer), wrfull (flags when write buffer is full), and wrusedw (9-bit output indicating stored word count in write buffer). Internal signals like sub_wire0 through sub_wire4 serve as interfaces linking the FIFO's internal logic to its I/O ports, ensuring appropriate signal routing. The module embeds the 'dcfifo_component' configured with a multitude of parameters to optimize its operation and inherits properties from the defined `dcfifo` type, specializing it specifically for handling overflow and underflow conditions, and ensuring data synchronization and integrity across different operational modes.

The FIFO, based on its parameters and naming, seems to be optimized for use within a Cyclone V FPGA and configured to use M10K memory blocks with a depth of 512 words, each 16 bits wide. The input ports (aclr, data, rdclk, rdreq, wrclk, wrreq) handle asynchronous clear, data to be written, read clock, read request, write clock, and write request, respectively. The output ports (q, rdempty, rdusedw, wrfull, wrusedw) provide the data output, read empty flag, read usage words count, write full flag, and write usage words count. The FIFO includes features like overflow and underflow checking, read and write synchronization delay pipes, and it is set to not show the next word to be read (lpm_showahead is \"OFF\")."
