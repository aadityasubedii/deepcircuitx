    "spec": "Module name: Wr_Test. \n\nModule specification: The Wr_Test module is designed for testing memory operations, specifically write and read functionalities, in storage systems. It operates based on a parameterized address and data width. The inputs for this module include a clock signal (iCLK) for synchronization, an active-low reset signal (iRST_n) for initialization, a button (iBUTTON) used to start the test sequence, and a read data port (readdata) for inputting data read from memory. The outputs comprise signals to control memory write (`write`) and read (`read`) operations, data to be written to the memory (`writedata`), and indicators for test pass (`drv_status_pass`), test fail (`drv_status_fail`), and test completion (`drv_status_test_complete`). Additionally, the output `same` indicates data integrity by comparing expected data with read data, and `c_state` is a 4-bit output showing the current state of the module\u2019s state machine.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes several signals including `pre_button` to debounce the iBUTTON input, `trigger` to initiate the memory test sequence, `write`, `read`, and `address` to control memory operations, `writedata` as the data being written to the memory, `write_count` to manage state transitions during testing, and `max_address` to indicate the reaching of the maximum address limit. The test sequence is controlled via a state machine that handles the cyclical write-read process, managing transitions based on the system state (`c_state`), write counts, and address increments, thus facilitating continuous memory verification until all allocated addresses are tested. The ROM module (`rom_test_inst`), connected through the wire `data`, supplies the expected values for this verification process.\n\nThe module systematically advances through testing states \u2013 from initialization and idle to active writing, reading, comparing data, and finally to pass/fail determination. Each state in the state machine is purposefully defined to manage the sequence of operations needed to test each aspect of the memory's functionality. The states handle instructions such as data writing, waiting counts for operation stability, address management for memory traversal, and result indication through status signals. The seamless operation of this module ensures robust verification and validation of memory integrity in testing scenarios.",

Here's a breakdown of its functionality:\n\n- The module is parameterized to handle a generic address and data width.\n- It takes an input clock signal (iCLK) and an active-low reset signal (iRST_n), as well as an input button (iBUTTON) that seems to start the test process.\n- It provides outputs to control write and read operations to a memory, including `write`, `writedata`, `read`, and an output for the read data (`readdata` from the memory).\n- The test logic cycles through states managed by a state machine (c_state). It begins in the idle state, waiting for a trigger from the iBUTTON press.\n- After triggering, it sequentially writes data (`data` from a ROM module named rom_test_inst) to subsequent memory addresses, then reads back the data and checks if the read data matches the expected data.\n- There are outputs to indicate test results: `drv_status_pass` (test passing), `drv_status_fail` (test failing), and `drv_status_test_complete` (test completion status).\n- The `same` signal is a comparison between the expected data and the data read back from memory to verify accuracy.\n- The module seems to continue writing and reading until it reaches the maximum address, as indicated by the `max_address` signal.\n\nOverall, this module seems to automate the process of writing data to memory and verifying its integrity by reading it back and comparing it with expected values. This is commonly used to validate memory operation in hardware tests."

It is asserted high when the module is in a state that should initiate a read operation from memory.\n\n- **address**: A register holding the current memory address for read and write operations. Its width is determined by the parameter `ADDR_W`. It is used to point to the location in memory where data should be written or read.\n\n- **writedata**: A register that holds the data to be written to memory. Its size is defined by `DATA_W` and the data content is fetched from a connected ROM module.\n\n- **write_count**: A 5-bit register acting as a counter used to plan the sequence of write operations and to control when to switch from writing to reading. It is incremented for each write or read cycle and reset as needed per the state machine logic.\n\n- **max_address**: A boolean (wire) that signals when the maximum address has been reached.

It operates based on a parameterized address and data width. The inputs for this module include a clock signal (iCLK) for synchronization, an active-low reset signal (iRST_n) for initialization, a button (iBUTTON) used to start the test sequence, and a read data port (readdata) for inputting data read from memory. The outputs comprise signals to control memory write (`write`) and read (`read`) operations, data to be written to the memory (`writedata`), and indicators for test pass (`drv_status_pass`), test fail (`drv_status_fail`), and test completion (`drv_status_test_complete`). Additionally, the output `same` indicates data integrity by comparing expected data with read data, and `c_state` is a 4-bit output showing the current state of the module\u2019s state machine.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes several signals including `pre_button` to debounce the iBUTTON input, `trigger` to initiate the memory test sequence, `write`, `read`, and `address` to control memory operations, `writedata` as the data being written to the memory, `write_count` to manage state transitions during testing, and `max_address` to indicate the reaching of the maximum address limit. The test sequence is controlled via a state machine that handles the cyclical write-read process, managing transitions based on the system state (`c_state`), write counts, and address increments, thus facilitating continuous memory verification until all allocated addresses are tested. The ROM module (`rom_test_inst`), connected through the wire `data`, supplies the expected values for this verification process.\n\nThe module systematically advances through testing states \u2013 from initialization and idle to active writing, reading, comparing data, and finally to pass/fail determination. Each state in the state machine is purposefully defined to manage the sequence of operations needed to test each aspect of the memory's functionality. The states handle instructions such as data writing, waiting counts for operation stability, address management for memory traversal, and result indication through status signals. The seamless operation of this module ensures robust verification and validation of memory integrity in testing scenarios."
