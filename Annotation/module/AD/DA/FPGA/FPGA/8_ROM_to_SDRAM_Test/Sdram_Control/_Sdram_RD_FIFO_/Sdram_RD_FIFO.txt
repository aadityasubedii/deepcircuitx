Module-level comment: The Sdram_RD_FIFO module is a dual-clock FIFO designed for SDRAM interfacing, managing data across separate read and write clock domains. It features input signals for data handling and control, including asynchronous reset and read/write requests, while outputting the FIFO status and data. Internally, it utilizes a dcfifo_component configured for Cyclone V specifications, ensuring robust data synchronization and storage management.
