    "spec": "Module name: sdram_pll0_0002.\nModule specification: The `sdram_pll0_0002` module encapsulates the functionality of a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) tailored for SDRAM applications. It leverages an Altera vendor-specific PLL to generate clock signals at distinct frequencies and phases. The module has two input ports: `refclk` serves as the reference clock input for the PLL to lock onto, and `rst` is a reset control used to reinitialize the PLL state. The outputs consist of two clock signals, `outclk_0` and `outclk_1`, both at a frequency of 100 MHz but with `outclk_1` phase-shifted by -3000 ps, as well as a `locked` signal indicating the PLL's locked status. Internally, this module does not declare or use any signals, as it acts purely as a wrapper for the instantiated `altera_pll_i` component. The `altera_pll` block within the code sets the parameters for the PLL, such as the number of clocks, their frequencies, phases, and duty cycles, and specifies the PLL type and subtype. The instantiation directly assigns input ports to the corresponding `altera_pll_i` inputs and maps the outputs to the module's output ports. Apart from the `altera_pll` block, there are no additional internal blocks or sections, indicating straightforward mapping from inputs to outputs through the `altera_pll_i` instantiation. \n\nThe format of the specification you have requested is as follows:\n```\nModule name: sdram_pll0_0002.\nModule specification: The 'sdram_pll0_0002' is a streamlined PLL configuration module designed for generating specific clock signals for SDRAM usage. With input ports for the reference clock (`refclk`) and reset signal (`rst`), the latter ensuring the ability to reinitialize the PLL, the module produces two 100 MHz output clock signals (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`). While `outclk_0` is in phase with the reference signal, `outclk_1` is uniquely phase-shifted by -3000 ps, useful for nuanced timing requirements. Additionally, the `locked` output informs of the PLL's locking status. Internally, no signals are defined; the module forwards functionality to the `altera_pll` configuration block, which sets up the PLL's mode, clock outputs, and various parameters, thus situating itself as a wiring mechanism to bind the input and PLL-generated output signals.\n```\n",

A PLL is an electronic circuit that can produce an output clock signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input reference clock signal. In this case, the PLL is instantiated using vendor-specific (Altera) parameters. It takes `refclk`, a reference clock input, and `rst`, a reset signal. It outputs two clock signals (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) at the same frequency of 100 MHz but with different phases; `outclk_1` has a phase shift of -3000 ps. The `locked` output indicates when the PLL has locked onto the reference signal, meaning the generated clocks are stable. Other configurations are set for potentially more clocks, but their frequencies are set to \"0 MHz,\" indicating they are not used in this specific instance. The PLL is general-purpose and is set to the \"normal\" operational mode."

It serves as the basis for generating the output clocks. The PLL adjusts its output clock frequency and phase based on this reference clock. \n- `rst`: This is the reset input. It is used to reset the internal state of the PLL. When activated, it reinitializes the PLL circuit, effectively restarting the phase-locking process. \n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`.\nExplanation: \n- `outclk_0`: This is one of the output clocks generated by the PLL. The frequency is set to 100 MHz, and it has no phase shift (0 ps) relative to the reference clock.\n- `outclk_1`: This is another output clock generated by the PLL. It also operates at a frequency of 100 MHz but includes a phase shift of -3000 ps. This allows for timing adjustments in applications requiring phase-aligned clock signals, such as in some SDRAM operations.\n- `locked`: This output indicates the lock status of the PLL. When high (`1`), it signifies that the PLL has successfully locked onto the reference clock, ensuring that the output clocks are stable and usable. This signal is crucial for system stability, as it confirms that the PLL outputs are reliable before they are used elsewhere in the system."
