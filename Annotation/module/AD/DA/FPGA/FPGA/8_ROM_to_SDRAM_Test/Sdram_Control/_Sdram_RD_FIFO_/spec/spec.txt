Module name: Sdram_RD_FIFO. 
Module specification: The Sdram_RD_FIFO is a synchronous dual-clock FIFO designed to interface with SDRAM, functioning between separate write and read clock domains. The module takes in data and control signals through input ports: `aclr` for an asynchronous reset, `data[15:0]` for the 16-bit data to be written into FIFO, `wrclk` and `wrreq` for write clock and write request, and `rdclk` and `rdreq` for read clock and read request. Its output ports consist of `q[15:0]` for the 16-bit data read from FIFO, `rdempty` and `wrfull` indicating whether the FIFO is empty or full, and `rdusedw[8:0]` and `wrusedw[8:0]` displaying counts of used words in read and write domains respectively. The module internally uses wires `sub_wire0[15:0]`, `sub_wire1`, `sub_wire2[8:0]`, `sub_wire3`, and `sub_wire4[8:0]` to connect the output of the `dcfifo_component` to the respective output ports. The `dcfifo_component` itself is parameterized for characteristics suitable for Cyclone V devices and includes configurations for memory block type, word size, overflow and underflow checking, among others. This decomposition of function within the Verilog code clearly outlines the data control flow and synchronization mechanisms necessary for FIFO operation in memory-intensive applications.
