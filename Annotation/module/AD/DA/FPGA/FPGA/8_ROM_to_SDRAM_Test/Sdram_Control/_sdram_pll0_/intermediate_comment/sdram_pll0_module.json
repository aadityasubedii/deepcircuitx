    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_pll0` module operates as a PLL tailored for SDRAM synchronization, deriving `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` from `refclk`. It features a `rst` input for reinitialization and a `locked` status output. Internally, it uses the `sdram_pll0_0002` submodule to handle PLL configurations directly linking input and outputs, streamlining its integration into broader memory interface systems."
