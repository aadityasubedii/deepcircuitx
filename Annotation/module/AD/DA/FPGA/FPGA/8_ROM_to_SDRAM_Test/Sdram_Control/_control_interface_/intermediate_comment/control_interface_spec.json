    "spec": "Module name: control_interface.\n\nModule specification: The `control_interface` module is designed to act as a command and control interface between a host device and an SDRAM memory component. It interprets and sequences operations such as read, write, initialization, and refresh cycles, based on input commands and signals. The module handles input ports including `CLK` for clock signals, `RESET_N` for active-low reset, `CMD` for command inputs, `ADDR` for address inputs, `REF_ACK` for refresh acknowledge from SDRAM, `INIT_ACK` for initialization acknowledge, and `CM_ACK` for command acknowledgement. Its output ports comprise control and status signals such as `NOP`, `READA`, `WRITEA`, `REFRESH`, `PRECHARGE`, `LOAD_MODE`, reflecting the proximate action for the SDRAM; `SADDR` echoing the address input post-latching; `REF_REQ` and `INIT_REQ` for initiating refresh and initialization sequences; and `CMD_ACK` indicating command acceptance for external interfacing. Internally, the module utilizes two main timers: `timer`, a 16-bit counter for managing refresh request timings, and `init_timer`, also a 16-bit counter, dedicated to timing the initialization procedure of the SDRAM. It operates through several always blocks that manage signal assignments based on conditions like reset state, command input, acknowledgment inputs, and internal timing, ensuring compliance with SDRAM operation protocols. These blocks include initialization and default state setting on reset for outputs and internal registers, command processing for determination and activation of current operation mode (e.g., read, write, no-operation), command acknowledgment handling, refresh request generation based on the internal timer and acknowledgement, and initialization sequencing managed by `init_timer` to trigger specific initialization steps like refresh, precharge, and load mode setting at precise counts. This modular design encapsulates the complexity of SDRAM command sequencing, ensuring efficient and scalable interfacing for various SDRAM configurations.",

It decrements every clock cycle and triggers a refresh request (by setting REF_REQ high) when it reaches zero. It is reset to a predefined REF_PER (indicating refresh period from \"Sdram_Params.h\") when a refresh acknowledge (REF_ACK) is received or adjusted based on SDRAM initialization needs.\n\n- **init_timer**: This 16-bit register is used during the SDRAM initialization phase. It gets incremented every clock cycle up to a predefined limit, managing the sequence and timing of various initialization commands such as refresh, precharge, and load mode commands. It uses the INIT_PER parameter from \"Sdram_Params.h\" to control the duration and steps of the SDRAM initialization process. Each specific count within the initialization sequence might trigger specific signals such as REFRESH, PRECHARGE, LOAD_MODE, etc., to manage SDRAM ready state efficiently."

It interprets and sequences operations such as read, write, initialization, and refresh cycles, based on input commands and signals. The module handles input ports including `CLK` for clock signals, `RESET_N` for active-low reset, `CMD` for command inputs, `ADDR` for address inputs, `REF_ACK` for refresh acknowledge from SDRAM, `INIT_ACK` for initialization acknowledge, and `CM_ACK` for command acknowledgement. Its output ports comprise control and status signals such as `NOP`, `READA`, `WRITEA`, `REFRESH`, `PRECHARGE`, `LOAD_MODE`, reflecting the proximate action for the SDRAM; `SADDR` echoing the address input post-latching; `REF_REQ` and `INIT_REQ` for initiating refresh and initialization sequences; and `CMD_ACK` indicating command acceptance for external interfacing. Internally, the module utilizes two main timers: `timer`, a 16-bit counter for managing refresh request timings, and `init_timer`, also a 16-bit counter, dedicated to timing the initialization procedure of the SDRAM. It operates through several always blocks that manage signal assignments based on conditions like reset state, command input, acknowledgment inputs, and internal timing, ensuring compliance with SDRAM operation protocols. These blocks include initialization and default state setting on reset for outputs and internal registers, command processing for determination and activation of current operation mode (e.g., read, write, no-operation), command acknowledgment handling, refresh request generation based on the internal timer and acknowledgement, and initialization sequencing managed by `init_timer` to trigger specific initialization steps like refresh, precharge, and load mode setting at precise counts. This modular design encapsulates the complexity of SDRAM command sequencing, ensuring efficient and scalable interfacing for various SDRAM configurations."
