Module name: Sdram_Control. Module specification: The Sdram_Control module is designed for interfacing and managing operations with an SDRAM memory, handling read and write commands, data transfers, and synchronization tasks. The module inputs include REF_CLK, a reference clock for internal synchronizations, and RESET_N, an active low reset signal for initializing states. Additional inputs control data transfers, such as WR_DATA for write data, and WR, WR_ADDR, WR_MAX_ADDR, WR_LENGTH, and WR_LOAD manage write operations, while RD, RD_ADDR, RD_MAX_ADDR, RD_LENGTH, and RD_LOAD manage read operations. CLK, WR_FULL, WR_USE, RD_DATA, RD_EMPTY, RD_USE, and SDR_CLK are outputs reflecting sync clocks and data buffer statuses. Control signals for SDRAM like CKE (clock enable) and WE_N (write enable) are also managed internally. Internally, signals like mADDR for modified address and CMD for command registration direct the operational logic. Several sub-modules including a pll for clock synchronization (sdram_pll0), command logic (command1), control interface (control1), and data management units (Sdram_WR_FIFO, Sdram_RD_FIFO) organize tasks such as generating SDRAM command sequences, managing input and output data flow through FIFOs, and ensuring correct timing and operation orders. This structured approach enables efficient data handling, state management, and response to external SDRAM commands within a synchronous digital system.
