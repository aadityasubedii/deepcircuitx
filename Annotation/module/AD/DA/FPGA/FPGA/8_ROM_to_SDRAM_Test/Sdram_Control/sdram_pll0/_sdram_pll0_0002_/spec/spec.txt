Module name: sdram_pll0_0002.
Module specification: The `sdram_pll0_0002` module encapsulates the functionality of a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) tailored for SDRAM applications. It leverages an Altera vendor-specific PLL to generate clock signals at distinct frequencies and phases. The module has two input ports: `refclk` serves as the reference clock input for the PLL to lock onto, and `rst` is a reset control used to reinitialize the PLL state. The outputs consist of two clock signals, `outclk_0` and `outclk_1`, both at a frequency of 100 MHz but with `outclk_1` phase-shifted by -3000 ps, as well as a `locked` signal indicating the PLL's locked status. Internally, this module does not declare or use any signals, as it acts purely as a wrapper for the instantiated `altera_pll_i` component. The `altera_pll` block within the code sets the parameters for the PLL, such as the number of clocks, their frequencies, phases, and duty cycles, and specifies the PLL type and subtype. The instantiation directly assigns input ports to the corresponding `altera_pll_i` inputs and maps the outputs to the module's output ports. Apart from the `altera_pll` block, there are no additional internal blocks or sections, indicating straightforward mapping from inputs to outputs through the `altera_pll_i` instantiation. 

The format of the specification you have requested is as follows:
```
Module name: sdram_pll0_0002.
Module specification: The 'sdram_pll0_0002' is a streamlined PLL configuration module designed for generating specific clock signals for SDRAM usage. With input ports for the reference clock (`refclk`) and reset signal (`rst`), the latter ensuring the ability to reinitialize the PLL, the module produces two 100 MHz output clock signals (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`). While `outclk_0` is in phase with the reference signal, `outclk_1` is uniquely phase-shifted by -3000 ps, useful for nuanced timing requirements. Additionally, the `locked` output informs of the PLL's locking status. Internally, no signals are defined; the module forwards functionality to the `altera_pll` configuration block, which sets up the PLL's mode, clock outputs, and various parameters, thus situating itself as a wiring mechanism to bind the input and PLL-generated output signals.
