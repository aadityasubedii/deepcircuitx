    "module": "Module-level comment: The Sdram_WR_FIFO module implements a dual clock FIFO for interfacing different clock domains in SDRAM systems. Using configurable M10K blocks on Cyclone V FPGAs, it facilitates robust data transfers with ports for data input/output and control signals. Internal wiring connects discrete FIFO component outputs to module ports, ensuring precise data flow management and signal integrity validated through synchronous creation and overflow/underflow checks."
