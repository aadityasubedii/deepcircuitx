    "spec": "Module name: rom_test. Module specification: The \"rom_test\" module is designed to simulate a read-only memory (ROM) using the \"altsyncram\" component from Altera, tailored specifically for the Cyclone V family. The module reads data based on a 16-bit input address and outputs the corresponding 16-bit data each time the input clock signal has a rising edge. The module has two input ports: \"address\" which takes a 16-bit address specifying the memory location to read, and \"clock\" which is the synchronization signal for reading operations. There is one 16-bit output port \"q\" which outputs the data read from the specified memory address. Internally, the module uses a wire \"sub_wire0\" which connects the output of the \"altsyncram\" component to the \"q\" output port, facilitating the transfer of data. The code begins with defining the module and I/O ports, followed by internal signal definitions. The \"altsyncram\" block is parameterized for ROM operation with specifics like no address or data asynchronous clear and an initialization file \"test.mif\" specifying the preset data. This block essentially handles the data retrieval based on the address provided, adhering to the specified operational mode and hardware family.",

The module is parameterized to operate in ROM mode with a memory initialization file (\"test.mif\"), indicating that the stored data is to be loaded from this file and not to be modified during runtime. The size of the memory is set to 65536 words, where each word is 16 bits wide, matching the width of the address and data ports. It operates using a single clock domain (clock0) and does not use any asynchronous clear signals for the address or the output data, as indicated by the \"NONE\" parameters for address_aclr_a and outdata_aclr_a.
