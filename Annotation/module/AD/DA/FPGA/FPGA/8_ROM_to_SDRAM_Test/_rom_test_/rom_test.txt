Module-level comment: The "rom_test" module emulates a 64KB ROM with 16-bit data width, using an Altera "altsyncram" component in ROM mode. It reads data synchronously on the positive clock edge given a 16-bit address input, delivering the output through the "q" port. Initialized with "test.mif", parameters ensure no runtime modification, supporting the Cyclone V device family.
