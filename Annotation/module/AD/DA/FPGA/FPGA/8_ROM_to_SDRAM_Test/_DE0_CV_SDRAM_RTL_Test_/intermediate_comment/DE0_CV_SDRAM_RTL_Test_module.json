    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE0_CV_SDRAM_RTL_Test module performs SDRAM read/write tests for DE0-CV FPGA boards. It generates clocks via PLL (pll_test), interprets user inputs (KEY) for control, and controls SDRAM signals (Sdram_Control) and test logic (Wr_Test), with status indicated by LEDs and 7-segment displays. Internal logic debounces inputs and monitors test progress with a heartbeat signal."
