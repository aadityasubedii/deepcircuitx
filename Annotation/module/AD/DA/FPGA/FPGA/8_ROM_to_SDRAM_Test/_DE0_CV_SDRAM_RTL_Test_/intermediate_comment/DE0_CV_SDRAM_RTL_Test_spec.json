    "spec": "Module name: DE0_CV_SDRAM_RTL_Test. Module specification: The DE0_CV_SDRAM_RTL_Test module is designed for testing SDRAM on the DE0-CV FPGA development board via a series of read and write operations. It interfaces with multiple clock inputs (CLOCK2_50, CLOCK3_50, CLOCK_50), a user input control (KEY), and system reset (RESET_N), with outputs for DRAM signal interfacing, LED indications, and VGA signals. Internal signals such as writedata and readdata manage data written to and read from the SDRAM respectively, with write and read control signals triggering these operations, mediated by clk_test, a clock signal derived from a PLL. The test_software_reset_n, test_global_reset_n, and test_start_n are debounced control signals derived from the keys used for initiating and resetting tests. The heart_beat counter monitors the status during tests. The code has significant sections: Sdram_Control for direct SDRAM interface, a PLL instantiation for clock management, the Wr_Test module managing the testing logic, and sequential logic for debouncing KEY input and driving status LEDs and resets based on test results. These orchestrated components enable comprehensive SDRAM functionality testing by utilizing input configurations and displaying results through visual outputs.",

This module appears to be designed to verify the functionality of SDRAM operations through a series of read and write tests. It interfaces with the SDRAM, providing necessary signals like address, bank select, control signals, and data bus. Specifically, the module generates a clock signal for SDRAM testing, handles resets and start signals based on button inputs (debounced over multiple clock cycles), and lights up LEDs to indicate the test status and result. Key features include the instantiation of a PLL for generating a test clock (`clk_test`), the SDRAM control unit (`Sdram_Control`), and a write/read test module (`Wr_Test`). There is also a heartbeat signal (`heart_beat`) implemented, likely used to monitor the activity or status of the test in progress. The overall purpose of the module is to facilitate hardware testing and validation of SDRAM memory interface functionality."

                    "text": "Module name: DE0_CV_SDRAM_RTL_Test. Module specification: The DE0_CV_SDRAM_RTL_Test module is designed for testing SDRAM on the DE0-CV FPGA development board via a series of read and write operations. It interfaces with multiple clock inputs (CLOCK2_50, CLOCK3_50, CLOCK_50), a user input control (KEY), and system reset (RESET_N), with outputs for DRAM signal interfacing, LED indications, and VGA signals. Internal signals such as writedata and readdata manage data written to and read from the SDRAM respectively, with write and read control signals triggering these operations, mediated by clk_test, a clock signal derived from a PLL. The test_software_reset_n, test_global_reset_n, and test_start_n are debounced control signals derived from the keys used for initiating and resetting tests. The heart_beat counter monitors the status during tests. The code has significant sections: Sdram_Control for direct SDRAM interface, a PLL instantiation for clock management, the Wr_Test module managing the testing logic, and sequential logic for debouncing KEY input and driving status LEDs and resets based on test results. These orchestrated components enable comprehensive SDRAM functionality testing by utilizing input configurations and displaying results through visual outputs."
