Module name: pll_test.
Module specification: The 'pll_test' module is a hardware component designed for clock management using a phase-locked loop (PLL) system. Its primary function is to generate two derived clock signals from a single reference clock input. It has two input ports: 'refclk', which accepts the reference clock signal to be used by the PLL as a basis for its output clocks, and 'rst', which is a reset signal to initialize the PLL's internal state. The module features two output ports: 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1', which provide the PLL's derived clock signals for use by other system components. No internal signals are defined or used within this module; all functionality is encapsulated within the externally instantiated 'pll_test_0002' component. This component maps its inputs to outputs directly, including a 'locked' signal, presumably indicating the PLL's lock status, although it remains unconnected in the given code block. The Verilog code is organized with only two major sections: the module declaration, which includes port definitions, and the instantiation of the 'pll_test_0002' PLL component, which describes the connectivity between the module's ports and the PLL instance.
