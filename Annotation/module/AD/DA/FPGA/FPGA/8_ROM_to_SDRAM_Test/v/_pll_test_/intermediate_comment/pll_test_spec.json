    "spec": "Module name: pll_test.\nModule specification: The 'pll_test' module is a hardware component designed for clock management using a phase-locked loop (PLL) system. Its primary function is to generate two derived clock signals from a single reference clock input. It has two input ports: 'refclk', which accepts the reference clock signal to be used by the PLL as a basis for its output clocks, and 'rst', which is a reset signal to initialize the PLL's internal state. The module features two output ports: 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1', which provide the PLL's derived clock signals for use by other system components. No internal signals are defined or used within this module; all functionality is encapsulated within the externally instantiated 'pll_test_0002' component. This component maps its inputs to outputs directly, including a 'locked' signal, presumably indicating the PLL's lock status, although it remains unconnected in the given code block. The Verilog code is organized with only two major sections: the module declaration, which includes port definitions, and the instantiation of the 'pll_test_0002' PLL component, which describes the connectivity between the module's ports and the PLL instance.",

The PLL takes an input reference clock signal ('refclk') and a reset signal ('rst'). It outputs two clock signals ('outclk_0' and 'outclk_1') which are likely to be derived from the reference clock with different frequencies or phase shifts, depending on the PLL's configuration. Additionally, there should be a 'locked' output signal that indicates when the PLL has achieved and is maintaining the desired frequency lock, but this signal does not seem to be connected to any external port in the provided code. The purpose of this module is likely to generate specific clock frequencies required for the operation of other parts of the system in which this module is used."
