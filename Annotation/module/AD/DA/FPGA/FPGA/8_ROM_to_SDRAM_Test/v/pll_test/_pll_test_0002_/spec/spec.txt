Module name: pll_test_0002.
Module specification: The 'pll_test_0002' module is a phase-locked loop (PLL) configuration tailored for generating two distinct clock frequencies from a single reference clock, specifically designed using Altera (Intel) technology. It features an input port, 'refclk', which is the reference clock serving as the base timing signal, and an input port, 'rst', which is used to reset the PLL to its initial state. The outputs include 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1', which provide the respective generated clock signals of 100 MHz and 200 MHz, and a 'locked' signal that indicates whether the PLL is locked to the reference and hence functional. Internally, there are no explicit signals within the 'pll_test_0002' module itself; however, the module instantiates an 'altera_pll' component that encompasses the internal complexities of the PLL, sparing the higher abstraction levels from such intricacies. The primary block of the code is the 'altera_pll' instantiation, which configures the PLL with specific attributes like reference clock frequency, operation mode, number of outputs, and their respective frequencies, phase shifts, duty cycles, type, and subtype. This configuration allows for straightforward use in systems requiring precise clock synchronization. The fed-back clock signals are not utilized, demonstrated by the unconnected 'fboutclk' and ground-connected 'fbclk'. Overall, the module serves as a facade for the complex 'altera_pll' block, presenting a simple interface with focused functionality.
