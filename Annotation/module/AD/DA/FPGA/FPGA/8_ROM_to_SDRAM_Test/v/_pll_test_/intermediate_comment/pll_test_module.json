    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pll_test' module generates two derived clock signals from a given reference clock ('refclk') using a PLL component ('pll_test_0002'). It takes in a reference clock and a reset signal ('rst') as inputs and outputs two frequency-adjusted clock signals ('outclk_0', 'outclk_1'). The implementation involves direct mapping of input signals to the PLL instance, with an unconnected 'locked' signal indicating PLL lock status."
