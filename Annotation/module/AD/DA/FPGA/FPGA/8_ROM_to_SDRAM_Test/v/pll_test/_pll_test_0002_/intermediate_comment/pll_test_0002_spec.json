    "spec": "Module name: pll_test_0002.\nModule specification: The 'pll_test_0002' module is a phase-locked loop (PLL) configuration tailored for generating two distinct clock frequencies from a single reference clock, specifically designed using Altera (Intel) technology. It features an input port, 'refclk', which is the reference clock serving as the base timing signal, and an input port, 'rst', which is used to reset the PLL to its initial state. The outputs include 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1', which provide the respective generated clock signals of 100 MHz and 200 MHz, and a 'locked' signal that indicates whether the PLL is locked to the reference and hence functional. Internally, there are no explicit signals within the 'pll_test_0002' module itself; however, the module instantiates an 'altera_pll' component that encompasses the internal complexities of the PLL, sparing the higher abstraction levels from such intricacies. The primary block of the code is the 'altera_pll' instantiation, which configures the PLL with specific attributes like reference clock frequency, operation mode, number of outputs, and their respective frequencies, phase shifts, duty cycles, type, and subtype. This configuration allows for straightforward use in systems requiring precise clock synchronization. The fed-back clock signals are not utilized, demonstrated by the unconnected 'fboutclk' and ground-connected 'fbclk'. Overall, the module serves as a facade for the complex 'altera_pll' block, presenting a simple interface with focused functionality.",

The module takes a reference clock input ('refclk') and a reset signal ('rst'). It produces two output clocks ('outclk_0' and 'outclk_1') and a 'locked' signal indicating the PLL has achieved and is maintaining the desired frequency lock. The PLL is configured for normal operation mode, influenced by the fundamental frequency of 50 MHz of the reference clock. It generates frequencies of 100 MHz and 200 MHz at the two outputs, respectively. The other PLL settings, like phase shift and duty cycle, are provided but set to basic values (e.g., 0 phase shift, 50% duty cycle). This module can be used in electronic systems where precise clock timing generations are crucial."

When a high signal is detected on 'rst', the PLL will reset to its initial configuration state.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, outclk_1, locked.  \nExplanation: \n- 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1' are the output ports where the PLL outputs the generated clock signals. For this module, 'outclk_0' is configured to 100 MHz and 'outclk_1' to 200 MHz.\n- 'locked' is a status signal that indicates whether the PLL has successfully synchronized to the reference clock and is outputting stable frequencies. A high signal on 'locked' means the PLL is operational and outputting the desired clock signals as configured."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nFrom the provided Verilog code and considering the nature of the module `pll_test_0002`, there are no explicitly defined internal signals within the module itself. The module primarily instantiates a PLL component and connects its inputs and outputs directly to the module's inputs and outputs. The parameters for configuring the PLL are also specified directly within the instantiation. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the `altera_pll` instance likely uses various internal signals internally to achieve its functionality (e.g., clock multiplication, division, phase adjustment, etc.), but these are encapsulated within the `altera_pll` module and are not exposed or modifiable in the context of the `pll_test_0002` module. Therefore, from a designer's perspective working with the `pll_test_0002` module, the internals of the `altera_pll` instantiation are abstracted away, and the focus is on how this module interacts with the environment through its inputs and outputs.\n\nSo, to directly answer your questions based on the given scenario:\n\nInternal signals: None specified within the `pll_test_0002` module.\n\nExplanation: The module does not define or utilize any internal signals explicitly. It directly interfaces with the `altera_pll` instantiation, connecting its inputs to the external inputs (`rst`, `refclk`) and outputs (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`) of the module. Any internal signaling required to implement the PLL's functionality is handled within the `altera_pll` component itself, and thus, not visible or relevant at the level of the `pll_test_0002` module's Verilog code."
