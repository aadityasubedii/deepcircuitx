The PLL takes an input reference clock signal ('refclk') and a reset signal ('rst'). It outputs two clock signals ('outclk_0' and 'outclk_1') which are likely to be derived from the reference clock with different frequencies or phase shifts, depending on the PLL's configuration. Additionally, there should be a 'locked' output signal that indicates when the PLL has achieved and is maintaining the desired frequency lock, but this signal does not seem to be connected to any external port in the provided code. The purpose of this module is likely to generate specific clock frequencies required for the operation of other parts of the system in which this module is used."

Explanation: The `refclk` is the input reference clock signal that the PLL uses as the base for generating the desired output clock frequencies. The `rst` is the reset input, which is used to reset the internal state of the PLL, effectively restarting the phase-locking process.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`. Explanation: `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` are the output clock signals generated by the PLL. They are derived from the reference clock (`refclk`) but can have different frequencies or phase shifts. These outputs are used to provide clock signals tailored to the needs of other components or modules in the system."
