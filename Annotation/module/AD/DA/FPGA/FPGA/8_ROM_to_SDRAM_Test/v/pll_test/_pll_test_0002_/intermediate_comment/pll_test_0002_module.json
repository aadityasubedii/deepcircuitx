    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pll_test_0002' module utilizes an Altera PLL component to generate two distinct clock frequencies from a 50 MHz reference clock. It accepts 'refclk' as input and outputs 'outclk_0' (100 MHz), 'outclk_1' (200 MHz), along with a 'locked' status. These configurations are embedded within the 'altera_pll' instantiation, which simplifies external interfacing while managing internal PLL complexities like phase shift and duty cycle."
