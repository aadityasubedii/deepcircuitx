The module takes a reference clock input ('refclk') and a reset signal ('rst'). It produces two output clocks ('outclk_0' and 'outclk_1') and a 'locked' signal indicating the PLL has achieved and is maintaining the desired frequency lock. The PLL is configured for normal operation mode, influenced by the fundamental frequency of 50 MHz of the reference clock. It generates frequencies of 100 MHz and 200 MHz at the two outputs, respectively. The other PLL settings, like phase shift and duty cycle, are provided but set to basic values (e.g., 0 phase shift, 50% duty cycle). This module can be used in electronic systems where precise clock timing generations are crucial."

When a high signal is detected on 'rst', the PLL will reset to its initial configuration state.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, outclk_1, locked.  \nExplanation: \n- 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1' are the output ports where the PLL outputs the generated clock signals. For this module, 'outclk_0' is configured to 100 MHz and 'outclk_1' to 200 MHz.\n- 'locked' is a status signal that indicates whether the PLL has successfully synchronized to the reference clock and is outputting stable frequencies. A high signal on 'locked' means the PLL is operational and outputting the desired clock signals as configured."
