Module name: RW_Test. 
Module specification: The RW_Test module is a Verilog-based testbench designed to perform read and write operations on a memory or target device to verify its functionality via a systematic test sequence. The module operates synchronously with an input clock (iCLK) and can be manually reset with an active low reset signal (iRST_n). It also utilizes an input button (iBUTTON) to trigger the commencement of the test sequence. The input read data (readdata) and various control signals, including write, read, and data comparison (same), facilitate the execution and monitoring of memory operations. The outputs of the module – write and read signals – command the writing and reading operations, respectively. Status signals like drv_status_pass, drv_status_fail, and drv_status_test_complete indicate the success or failure and the completion of tests. Internally, the module leverages registers, counters, and combinatorial logic to manage the state (c_state), data handling, and address incrementation, necessary for generating and validating memory transactions sequentially. The code’s key blocks orchestrate initialization, button press detection, write operations setup with data pattern generation, and data read-back for validation. Conditions checked throughout these stages determine the progression between states from testing setup, through write/read cycles, to test completion and result signaling. This modular approach ensures a structured and clear sequence for memory testing, crucial for diagnosing and ensuring system reliability.
