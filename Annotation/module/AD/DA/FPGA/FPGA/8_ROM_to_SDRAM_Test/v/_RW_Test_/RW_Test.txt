Module-level comment: The RW_Test module facilitates verification of memory read/write operations. It employs a state machine synchronized to an input clock (iCLK), with rest (iRST_n), and a button-trigger (iBUTTON) to sequence through tests. It generates patterns for write operations, compares them during reads, and sets status flags upon test completion. Internal counters and registers control state transitions, data pattern generation, and address incrementation for comprehensive memory testing.
