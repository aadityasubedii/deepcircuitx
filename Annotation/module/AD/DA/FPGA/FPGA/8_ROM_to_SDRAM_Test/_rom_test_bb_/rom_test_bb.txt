Module-level comment: The `rom_test` module is designed for a Read-Only Memory (ROM) test structure but lacks internal functionality. It includes an input `address` (16 bits) for data selection, an unusual tri-state `clock` input, and an output `q` (16 bits) without defined behavior. The empty `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS` blocks suggest placeholders for potential Quartus-specific synthesis settings. This module has defined I/O ports but no operational implementation, leaving its full functionality unestablished.
