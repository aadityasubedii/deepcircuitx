Module name: rom_test.
Module specification: The `rom_test` module, as suggested by its name, might be intended to represent a form of Read-Only Memory (ROM) test structure with undefined behavior due to a lack of internal implementation. It contains input ports `address` ([15:0]) and `clock`, where `address` is presumed to be used for selecting a data word, and `clock` is meant for synchronization purposes, though its double declaration including one as a tri-state (`tri1 clock;`) is unusual and likely incorrect for a clock signal. The single output port `q` ([15:0]) has no defined logic or behavior and is consequently unavailable for data output. There are no internal signals or logic in the code snippet, leaving the module devoid of any observable functionality or internal communication. The code includes two empty Verilog preprocessor conditional compilation (``ifndef ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS``) blocks that might have been placeholders for Quartus-specific synthesis settings, but they are without content. In summary, the `rom_test` module has a structure defined for input and output interfaces but lacks any operative RTL code, and hence, its exact function cannot be ascertained from the given details.
