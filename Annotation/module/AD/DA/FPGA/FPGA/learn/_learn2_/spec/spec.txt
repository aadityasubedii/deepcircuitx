Module name: learn2.
Module specification: The 'learn2' Verilog module is designed to act as a blinker for an LED, toggling its state every second based on a 50 MHz clock input. The module has two input ports: 'CLK_50M', which serves as the clock reference determining the timing of operations; and 'RST_N', an active low reset signal that initializes the internal state. The sole output port is 'LED1', which connects to the LED that blinks. Internally, the module utilizes 'time_cnt', a 27-bit register serving as a counter to track clock cycles up to the defined 1-second interval (50 million cycles) as set by the 'SET_TIME_1S' parameter. The 'time_cnt_n' signal holds the next state for 'time_cnt'. There's also a single-bit register 'led_reg' mirroring the state of the LED, while 'led_reg_n' stores its next state. The code consists of four 'always' blocks: two for the synchronous assignments for 'time_cnt' and 'led_reg' on clock edges and reset events, and two combinational blocks that define 'time_cnt_n' and 'led_reg_n' logic. The LED state is driven by the value of 'led_reg', which gets updated on clock edges to 'led_reg_n', effectively creating the blinking behavior on a cycle-by-cycle basis.
