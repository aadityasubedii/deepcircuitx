    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'learn2' module implements an LED blinker driven by a 50 MHz clock. It leverages a 27-bit counter ('time_cnt') to track elapsed time, toggling the LED state each second. Synchronous always blocks manage state updates on clock edges and asynchronous resets, while combinational always blocks define next-state logic, ensuring LED toggles are precisely timed."
