    "spec": "Module name: learn2.\nModule specification: The 'learn2' Verilog module is designed to act as a blinker for an LED, toggling its state every second based on a 50 MHz clock input. The module has two input ports: 'CLK_50M', which serves as the clock reference determining the timing of operations; and 'RST_N', an active low reset signal that initializes the internal state. The sole output port is 'LED1', which connects to the LED that blinks. Internally, the module utilizes 'time_cnt', a 27-bit register serving as a counter to track clock cycles up to the defined 1-second interval (50 million cycles) as set by the 'SET_TIME_1S' parameter. The 'time_cnt_n' signal holds the next state for 'time_cnt'. There's also a single-bit register 'led_reg' mirroring the state of the LED, while 'led_reg_n' stores its next state. The code consists of four 'always' blocks: two for the synchronous assignments for 'time_cnt' and 'led_reg' on clock edges and reset events, and two combinational blocks that define 'time_cnt_n' and 'led_reg_n' logic. The LED state is driven by the value of 'led_reg', which gets updated on clock edges to 'led_reg_n', effectively creating the blinking behavior on a cycle-by-cycle basis.",

It contains logic that drives the `LED1` output based on a 50 MHz clock input (`CLK_50M`). The LED's state toggles once every second (as determined by the `SET_TIME_1S` parameter, which is set to represent a 1-second duration at a 50 MHz clock rate). A reset input (`RST_N`) asynchronously resets the internal timer (`time_cnt`) and the state of the LED (`led_reg`) when it is active low. The `time_cnt` register counts clock cycles, and, when it reaches one second (50 million cycles), it resets to zero and toggles `led_reg`, which in turn toggles `LED1`. The synchronization to the clock and reset is done through two separate always blocks, one handling `time_cnt` and the other handling `led_reg`."

It provides the timing reference for the internal logic and state changes within the module, such as the blinking of the LED.\n- RST_N: This is the reset input for the module, active low. When RST_N is pulled low, it asynchronously resets the internal counter (time_cnt) and the LED state register (led_reg) to their initial states.\n\nOutput ports: LED1.\nExplanation:\n- LED1: This is the output port connected to an LED. The state of this output toggles every second (determined by the module's internal logic) to create a blinking LED effect. The toggling is based on the 50 MHz clock input and the parameter `SET_TIME_1S` which defines the duration equivalent to one second at the given clock frequency."

It increments continuously until it matches the value defined by `SET_TIME_1S` (50 million), indicating that one second has elapsed. It then resets to zero.\n\n- time_cnt_n: This signal represents the next state of `time_cnt`. During each cycle, it holds the value to which `time_cnt` will be updated in the next positive clock edge or negative reset edge. If the `time_cnt` equals `SET_TIME_1S`, `time_cnt_n` is set to zero; otherwise, it simply increments `time_cnt` by one.\n\n- led_reg: This is a single-bit register that holds the current state of the `LED1` output. The state of this register toggles every time `time_cnt` reaches the value `SET_TIME_1S`, causing the LED connected to this output to blink.\n\n- led_reg_n: This signal holds the next state of `led_reg` and is computed concurrently with `time_cnt`. If the `time_cnt` matches `SET_TIME_1S`, then `led_reg_n` toggles the state of `led_reg`; otherwise, it retains the current state of `led_reg`. This behavior ensures that the LED blinks each second."
