    "module": "Module-level comment: The `fifo_wr` module manages FIFO write operations, handling synchronous data transfer across different clock domains. It interfaces with signals for asynchronous resets, read and write requests, and clock inputs. Outputs indicate FIFO status such as fullness or emptiness and data counts. Internal mechanics likely involve pointers, FIFO memory, and status flags but specifics are abstracted in this interface-only depiction."
