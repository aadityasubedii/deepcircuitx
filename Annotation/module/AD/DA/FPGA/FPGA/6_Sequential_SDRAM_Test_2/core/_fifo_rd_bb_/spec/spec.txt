Module name: fifo_rd. Module specification: The 'fifo_rd' module is designed as an asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer which operates across different clock domains using separate read (rdclk) and write (wrclk) clocks. This is typically used for data transfer between components operating at different clock rates. Input ports include an asynchronous clear signal 'aclr', a 16-bit data input 'data', and control signals 'rdreq' (read request) and 'wrreq' (write request). These control the operations of reading from and writing to the FIFO, respectively. The output ports comprise a 16-bit data output 'q', a read side empty flag 'rdempty', an 8-bit read used words count 'rdusedw', a write side full flag 'wrfull', and an 8-bit write used words count 'wrusedw'. Although the provided code snippet does not detail internal signals or logic, in a fully implemented version, these would typically include read and write pointers, data storage elements, and control logic to manage data flow and state transitions within the FIFO. The module likely contains blocks for managing read and write operations, data storage, and status flag updates, but specific details are absent in the provided snippet. This structure allows for effective data buffering and synchronization across different system components.
