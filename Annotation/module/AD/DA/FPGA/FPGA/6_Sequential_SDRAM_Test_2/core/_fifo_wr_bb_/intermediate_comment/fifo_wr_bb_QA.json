It ensures the FIFO starts from a known state when activated.\n- `data`: 16-bit data input to FIFO. This is the actual data that needs to be stored in the FIFO buffer during a write operation.\n- `rdclk`: Read clock input, drives the timing of data reads from the FIFO.\n- `rdreq`: Read request input, a signal that when active, triggers a data read operation from the FIFO.\n- `wrclk`: Write clock input, drives the timing of data writes into the FIFO.\n- `wrreq`: Write request input, a signal that when active, triggers a data write operation into the FIFO.\n\nOutput ports: `q`, `rdempty`, `rdusedw`, `wrfull`, `wrusedw`.\nExplanation:\n- `q`: 16-bit data output from FIFO. This output carries the data that has been read from the FIFO.\n- `rdempty`: Read empty output signal, boolean flag that indicates whether the FIFO is empty (True if empty, False otherwise). Helps the read operations to determine the availability of data.\n- `rdusedw`: 8-bit output showing the used word count on the read side of the FIFO. It indicates how many data slots are currently filled and ready to be read.\n- `wrfull`: Write full output signal, boolean flag that reports if the FIFO is full (True if full, False otherwise). It helps manage the flow of data into the FIFO by indicating when it is no longer able to accept new data.\n- `wrusedw`: 8-bit output that indicates the number of used word slots on the write side of the FIFO. This helps in identifying how much of the FIFO's capacity has been used up and how much remains available for new data."
