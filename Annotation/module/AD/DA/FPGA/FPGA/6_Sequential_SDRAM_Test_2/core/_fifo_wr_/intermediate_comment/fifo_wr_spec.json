It uses separate clock domains for read (`rdclk`) and write (`wrclk`) operations, accepting 16-bit `data` to be written into the FIFO when the `wrreq` signal is asserted, and providing data to be read (`q`) when `rdreq` is asserted. The FIFO's asynchronous clear (`aclr`) signal resets the FIFO when activated. The status of the FIFO is presented through the `rdempty` and `wrfull` flags, signaling when the FIFO is empty or full. Additionally, the module keeps count of the words available for reading (`rdusedw`) and the words written (`wrusedw`). Internally, the module utilizes these sub-wires to connect the outputs of the `dcfifo` component to its ports, ensuring the proper propagation of status information. The module is structured to first define the input and output ports, followed by the declaration of internal signals. The main block of the module instantiates the `dcfifo` component, sets up the internal signal connections, and configures the component with predefined parameters such as FIFO depth, word size, and read/write delays for synchronization, among other configurations, ensuring that the FIFO behaves as intended for its target device and application.",

It has inputs for data to be written (`data`), write enable (`wrreq`), read enable (`rdreq`), and asynchronous clear (`aclr`).
