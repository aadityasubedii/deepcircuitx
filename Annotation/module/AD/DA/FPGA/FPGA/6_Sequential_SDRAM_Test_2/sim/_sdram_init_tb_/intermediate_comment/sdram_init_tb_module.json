    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_init_tb` module serves as a testbench for SDRAM initialization, simulating the application of commands and observing the `Init_done` signal. It orchestrates the process by generating a clock signal, managing reset logic, and driving command/address inputs through the `sdram_init` instance. An inverted clock and control signals (derived from `Command`) interface with a mocked SDRAM model (`sdr`) to validate the initialization sequence's correctness and timing, ensuring accurate simulation of SDRAM behavior."
