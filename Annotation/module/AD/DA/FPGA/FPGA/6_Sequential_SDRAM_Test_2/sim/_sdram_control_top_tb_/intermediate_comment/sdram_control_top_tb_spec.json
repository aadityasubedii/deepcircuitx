    "spec": "Module name: sdram_control_top_tb.\n\nModule specification: The `sdram_control_top_tb` is a Verilog testbench module designed to simulate and verify the functionality of the `sdram_control_top` module, which interfaces with SDRAM. It lacks traditional input and output ports due to its nature as a testbench and uses internal signaling and instantiated submodules for simulation purposes. Key inputs include `Clk` (system clock), `Rst_n` (reset signal), `Wr_data` (data to write to SDRAM), `Wr_en` (write enable signal), `Wr_load` (signal to load write configuration), `Wr_clk` (write-specific clock), `Rd_en` (read enable signal), `Rd_load` (signal to load read configuration), and `Rd_clk` (read-specific clock). Outputs primarily consist of `Rd_data` (data read from SDRAM) and various SDRAM control signals like `Sa`, `Ba`, `Cs_n`, `Cke`, `Ras_n`, `Cas_n`, `We_n`, `Dq`, and `Dqm`. Internally, `sdram_clk` is defined to control the SDRAM clocking opposite to the `Clk`. The `init_done` flag from the `sdram_control_top` submodule signals when the SDRAM initialization is complete, which is essential for the correct sequence initiation in the testbench.\n\nThe module features several key blocks or sections: Clock generation for `Clk`, `Wr_clk`, and `Rd_clk` which operates at specified frequencies for system and read/write operations; Initial conditions setting for the signals and the `sdram_control_top` submodule's interaction along with the instantiation of the SDRAM model (`sdr`) mimicking the actual SDRAM's behavior. The execution sequence starts with a reset, followed by waiting for the SDRAM initialization completion, conducting multiple write operations by iteratively updating `Wr_data`, and finally, toggling off the enable signals for read and write operations, leading to simulation termination.\n\nThis testbench effectively demonstrates the initialization, read, and write functionalities of the SDRAM control system, ensuring the `sdram_control_top` module operates as expected without the use of physical SDRAM hardware, using modeled behavior and response simulation.",

                    "text": "Module name: sdram_control_top_tb.\n\nModule specification: The `sdram_control_top_tb` is a Verilog testbench module designed to simulate and verify the functionality of the `sdram_control_top` module, which interfaces with SDRAM. It lacks traditional input and output ports due to its nature as a testbench and uses internal signaling and instantiated submodules for simulation purposes. Key inputs include `Clk` (system clock), `Rst_n` (reset signal), `Wr_data` (data to write to SDRAM), `Wr_en` (write enable signal), `Wr_load` (signal to load write configuration), `Wr_clk` (write-specific clock), `Rd_en` (read enable signal), `Rd_load` (signal to load read configuration), and `Rd_clk` (read-specific clock). Outputs primarily consist of `Rd_data` (data read from SDRAM) and various SDRAM control signals like `Sa`, `Ba`, `Cs_n`, `Cke`, `Ras_n`, `Cas_n`, `We_n`, `Dq`, and `Dqm`. Internally, `sdram_clk` is defined to control the SDRAM clocking opposite to the `Clk`. The `init_done` flag from the `sdram_control_top` submodule signals when the SDRAM initialization is complete, which is essential for the correct sequence initiation in the testbench.\n\nThe module features several key blocks or sections: Clock generation for `Clk`, `Wr_clk`, and `Rd_clk` which operates at specified frequencies for system and read/write operations; Initial conditions setting for the signals and the `sdram_control_top` submodule's interaction along with the instantiation of the SDRAM model (`sdr`) mimicking the actual SDRAM's behavior. The execution sequence starts with a reset, followed by waiting for the SDRAM initialization completion, conducting multiple write operations by iteratively updating `Wr_data`, and finally, toggling off the enable signals for read and write operations, leading to simulation termination.\n\nThis testbench effectively demonstrates the initialization, read, and write functionalities of the SDRAM control system, ensuring the `sdram_control_top` module operates as expected without the use of physical SDRAM hardware, using modeled behavior and response simulation."
