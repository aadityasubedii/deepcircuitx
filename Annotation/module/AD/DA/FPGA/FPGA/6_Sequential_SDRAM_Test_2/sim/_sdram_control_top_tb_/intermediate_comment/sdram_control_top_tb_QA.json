It also initializes reset (`Rst_n`), write load signal (`Wr_load`), and read load signal (`Rd_load`), and controls the write (`Wr_data` and `Wr_en`) and read (`Rd_en`) operations to and from the SDRAM. It monitors the `init_done` signal from the `sdram_control_top` module to begin read/write operations once initialization is complete. Write operations are performed repeatedly, incrementing `Wr_data` on every write clock edge, until a specified condition where write enable (`Wr_en`) is deactivated. After some delay, read enable (`Rd_en`) is also deactivated and the simulation is stopped.\n\nThis testbench effectively provides a framework to verify that the `sdram_control_top` module can initialize, write to, and read from the SDRAM correctly by asserting the appropriate signals and observing the behavior of the module under test.
