Module name: sdram_init_tb.
Module specification: The `sdram_init_tb` is a Verilog testbench module designed to simulate the initialization process of an SDRAM. Its primary functionality is to generate stimuli such as clock signals and active-low reset signals, ensuring synchronization and a known starting state for the SDRAM initialization. It interfaces directly with an instance of the `sdram_init` module to simulate the sequence of commands necessary for SDRAM startup and monitors a `Init_done` signal to determine the completion of this process. The testbench also simulates an SDRAM hardware model to validate interactions with real-world SDRAM behavior. 

The internal signals of this module include `Clk` (primary clock), `Rst_n` (active-low reset), `Command` (4-bit SDRAM command interface), `Saddr` (SDRAM address used by initialization), `Init_done` (indicates end of initialization), `sd_clk` (inverted clock for SDRAM model), and various signals derived from 'Command' such as `Cs_n`, `Ras_n`, `Cas_n`, and `We_n` which serve as chip select, row address strobe, column address strobe, and write enable signals, respectively.

The code block defining the `sdram_init` instance connects the testbench signals to the respective inputs and outputs of the actual SDRAM initialization module. It uses `assign` statements to derive control signals from the `Command` output and invert the clock signal for the SDRAM model. The `sdr` instance represents the SDRAM model under test, with `Saddr` and others connected to simulate the memory's response. The initial clock signal generation is handled by an `initial` block setting Clk to 1, followed by an `always` block toggling this clock signal. A separate initial block manages the reset signal's assertion and deassertion sequence, and upon the assertion of `Init_done`, simulates some time passage before stopping the simulation.

This specification outlines both the dynamic activity and static design of the `sdram_init_tb` module to ensure that the SDRAM initialization is thoroughly tested under simulated conditions.
