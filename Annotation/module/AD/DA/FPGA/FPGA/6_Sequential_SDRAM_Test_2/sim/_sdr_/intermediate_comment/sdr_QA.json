It handles various SDRAM operations including activation, read, write, precharge, and refresh commands. The module manages multiple banks of memory, handles burst operations, and implements timing checks to ensure proper SDRAM operation. It also includes debug functionality and supports different data widths (x4, x8, x16). The module interfaces with external signals for clock, control, address, and data, while internally managing the memory array and enforcing SDRAM timing constraints."
