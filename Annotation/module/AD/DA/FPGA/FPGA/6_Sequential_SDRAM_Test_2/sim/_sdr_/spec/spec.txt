Module name: sdr. Module specification: The sdr module implements a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) controller that manages various SDRAM operations including activation, read, write, precharge, and refresh commands. It handles multiple banks of memory, supports burst operations, and enforces SDRAM timing constraints. The module has input ports for clock (Clk), control signals (Cke, Cs_n, Ras_n, Cas_n, We_n), address (Addr), bank address (Ba), and data mask (Dqm), along with a bidirectional data bus (Dq) for reading and writing data. Internally, it uses signals like Bank0-3 for memory arrays, Command for tracking current operations, and various address and timing registers. The module is structured into sections for command decoding, internal timing management, data input/output handling, and burst operations.
