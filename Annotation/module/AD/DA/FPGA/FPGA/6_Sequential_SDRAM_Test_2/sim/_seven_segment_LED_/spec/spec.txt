Module name: seven_segment_LED.
Module specification: The seven_segment_LED module is designed to drive a six-digit seven-segment display based on a 20-bit input binary number (num). The module operates synchronously with a clock signal (clk) and includes an asynchronous active-low reset (rst_n). Upon reset, it clears the 42-bit seven-segment output (segs) to turn off all segments. The input ports consist of `rst_n` for resetting the module, `clk` for updating the outputs at every positive edge, and `num` which represents the value to be displayed. The output port, `segs`, contains the bitwise encoding for six digits, each 7 bits long, to control the individual segments of a seven-segment display. Internally, the module uses `lnum` to capture the latest `num` value on every clock cycle and retains its value across cycles. The `ctable` is a lookup table array that stores pre-defined seven-segment codes for the decimal digits 0-9, facilitating fast digit encoding. The Verilog code defines a sequential logic block that first updates the `lnum` register synchronously with the clock and then, on the non-reset condition, calculates and assigns segment values to `segs` by extracting and converting each digit of `lnum` into its corresponding seven-segment encoding using the `ctable`. The encoding process isolates each decimal digit through division and modulo operations by successive powers of 10 (from 10^5 down to 10^0 for each digit), and relevant portions of `ctable` are accessed using indexed part-selects to fill the `segs`. This module is an essential component for digital systems that need to visually represent numerical values using LED displays in various applications.
