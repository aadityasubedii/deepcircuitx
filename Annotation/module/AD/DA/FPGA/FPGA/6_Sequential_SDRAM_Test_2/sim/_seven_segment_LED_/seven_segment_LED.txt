Module-level comment: The seven_segment_LED module drives a six-digit seven-segment display based on a 20-bit binary input (`num`). It updates on the rising edge of `clk` and asynchronously resets with `rst_n`. Internally, it stores `num` in `lnum`, and uses a lookup table (`ctable`) to convert each digit into a 7-segment encoding, which is then assigned to the 42-bit output (`segs`). This design enables dynamic numerical display with minimal computational overhead, ideal for real-time applications.
