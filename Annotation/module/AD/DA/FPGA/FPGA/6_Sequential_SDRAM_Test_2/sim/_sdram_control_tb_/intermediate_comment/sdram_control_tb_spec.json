    "spec": "Module name: sdram_control_tb.\nModule specification: The 'sdram_control_tb' is a testbench Verilog module designed to test the SDRAM control logic by simulating read and write operations to an SDRAM. Its input ports include 'Clk' which serves as the system clock, 'Rst_n' as an active-low reset signal, 'Wr' as a write enable, 'Rd' as a read enable, 'Caddr' as the column address, 'Raddr' as the row address, 'Baddr' as the bank address, and 'Wr_data' representing the data to write to the SDRAM. The output ports feature 'Rd_data' for the data read from SDRAM, 'Wr_data_vaild' to indicate valid write data, 'Rd_data_vaild' to confirm valid read data, and 'Rdata_done' to signal the completion of a read data transaction. Internal signals include 'sdram_clk' (a negated version of Clk), 'sdram_cke' for clock enable, 'sdram_cs_n' as chip select, 'sdram_ras_n', 'sdram_cas_n', and 'sdram_we_n' for controlling the type of operation and address selection, 'sdram_bank' as the bank address signal, 'sdram_addr' for row or column address, 'sdram_dq' as the bidirectional data bus, and 'sdram_dqm' for data masking on write operations.\n\nThe code initializes signal values and simulates SDRAM operation by declaring instances of 'sdram_control' and 'sdr' modules, representing the SDRAM control logic and the SDRAM model, respectively. The testbench executes a sequence of operations, including SDRAM initialization, followed by a series of write and read operations with appropriate signal toggling and data assertion. This is done to verify the functionality and the timing of the SDRAM control logic. Multiple initial blocks are used to handle different aspects of the simulation: clock signal generation, reset and test sequence initiation, data generation for write operations, and control flow for overall test execution, including simulation termination with `$stop`. Overall, the testbench module is crafted to thoroughly exercise and validate the SDRAM controller's ability to manage memory operations accurately and efficiently.",

Its input ports include 'Clk' which serves as the system clock, 'Rst_n' as an active-low reset signal, 'Wr' as a write enable, 'Rd' as a read enable, 'Caddr' as the column address, 'Raddr' as the row address, 'Baddr' as the bank address, and 'Wr_data' representing the data to write to the SDRAM. The output ports feature 'Rd_data' for the data read from SDRAM, 'Wr_data_vaild' to indicate valid write data, 'Rd_data_vaild' to confirm valid read data, and 'Rdata_done' to signal the completion of a read data transaction. Internal signals include 'sdram_clk' (a negated version of Clk), 'sdram_cke' for clock enable, 'sdram_cs_n' as chip select, 'sdram_ras_n', 'sdram_cas_n', and 'sdram_we_n' for controlling the type of operation and address selection, 'sdram_bank' as the bank address signal, 'sdram_addr' for row or column address, 'sdram_dq' as the bidirectional data bus, and 'sdram_dqm' for data masking on write operations.\n\nThe code initializes signal values and simulates SDRAM operation by declaring instances of 'sdram_control' and 'sdr' modules, representing the SDRAM control logic and the SDRAM model, respectively. The testbench executes a sequence of operations, including SDRAM initialization, followed by a series of write and read operations with appropriate signal toggling and data assertion. This is done to verify the functionality and the timing of the SDRAM control logic. Multiple initial blocks are used to handle different aspects of the simulation: clock signal generation, reset and test sequence initiation, data generation for write operations, and control flow for overall test execution, including simulation termination with `$stop`. Overall, the testbench module is crafted to thoroughly exercise and validate the SDRAM controller's ability to manage memory operations accurately and efficiently."
