    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'sdram_control_tb' is a Verilog testbench for validating SDRAM control logic. It simulates SDRAM reads/writes by toggling input signals to check data integrity and timing. Submodules 'sdram_control' and 'sdr' model the memory and control logic, with internal signals interfacing accordingly. Clock generation, reset, test sequences, and handshakes are orchestrated to ensure comprehensive operation verification."
