Module-level comment: This module implements an SDRAM controller managing activation, read, write, precharge, and refresh operations. It handles multiple memory banks, supports burst operations, and enforces timing constraints. The controller decodes commands, manages internal timing, handles data I/O, and implements burst operations. It uses internal registers and state machines to track bank status, address information, and current operations, ensuring proper SDRAM functionality and timing adherence.
