The seven-segment display is typically used to display numerical digits by activating segments to form the correct number. Each digit on the display is represented by a 7-bit code which, when applied to the seven segments (a-g), turns certain segments on or off to display a numeral from 0 to 9.\n\nThe module checks for a rising edge of a clock signal (`clk`) or a falling edge of a reset signal (`rst_n`). Upon reset (when `rst_n` is low), it clears the `segs` output to 0, turning off all segments. During normal operation (when `rst_n` is high), the module calculates which segments should be on for each digit by dividing (`num`) and taking modulo by powers of 10 to isolate digits, and then indexing into a parameter lookup table `ctable`. This lookup table appears to contain the 7-segment representations of numbers 0 through 9, with each digit's segment configuration stored in 8 bits (the eighth bit appears to remain unused in this context). The calculated segment states are then placed in the correct positions of the `segs` output to drive the display."

It is active low, meaning that the module resets and clears all outputs when this signal is driven low.\n- `clk`: This is the clock input, crucial for sequential logic. The module updates its outputs on the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- `num`: This is a 20-bit binary input number. This number is used to determine the values displayed on the seven-segment display, with each of its digits being decoded to control segment states.\n\nOutput ports: `segs`.  \nExplanation: \n- `segs`: This is a 42-bit output where each group of 7 bits represents the state of a seven-segment display for a single digit. There are six groups, supporting up to six digits, with each bit in a group controlling an individual segment (a-g) of the display to show the correct numeral from 0 to 9."

It is used to store the binary number which is to be displayed on the seven-segment display. This register retains the value across clock cycles until a new value is sampled, ensuring that the computation for the seven-segment display encoding can use a stable value during the entire clock cycle.\n\n- `ctable`: This is a parameter array that serves as a constant lookup table for the seven-segment encoding of the numbers 0 through 9. It is defined as a packed array of 8-bit entries where each entry corresponds to the encoding for a single digit. The higher 7 bits of each entry define the on/off status of each segment in the seven-segment display from 'g' to 'a' segment (from MSB to LSB), and the last bit seems to be unused or reserved for a potential decimal point or other functionality which is not used in the current module code. The `ctable` is used in the module to quickly match a numerical digit to its corresponding 7-bit segment display encoding, which is then used to set the `segs` output for each digit displayed."
