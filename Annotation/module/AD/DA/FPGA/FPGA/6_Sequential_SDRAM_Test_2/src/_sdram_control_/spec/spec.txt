Module name: sdram_control.

Module specification: The `sdram_control` module is responsible for interfacing a system with Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM). It manages initialization, periodic refresh cycles, and data read/write operations, aligning controller actions with SDRAM specifications. The module accepts input ports including `Clk` (clock signal), `Rst_n` (reset), `Wr` (write enable), `Rd` (read enable), and address and data signals like `Caddr`, `Raddr`, `Baddr`, and `Wr_data`. Output ports comprise `Rd_data` (data read from SDRAM), various status indicators such as `Rd_data_vaild`, `Wr_data_vaild`, `Wdata_done`, `Rdata_done`, several SDRAM command signals (`Cs_n`, `Ras_n`, `Cas_n`, `We_n`), and `Dq` (bidirectional data lines). Internally, the module utilizes a finite state machine managed by the `main_state` signal, with various counters and flags like `ref_time_cnt`, `FF`, `Command`, and operational flags (`ref_opt_done`, `wr_opt_done`, `rd_opt_done`) to coordinate operations. It includes multiple sections for handling state transitions, SDRAM command generation, handling initialization via tasks like `auto_ref`, and managing read/write operations with tasks `write_data` and `read_data`. The control flow depends significantly on SDRAM's timing and protocol requirements, ensuring consistent and accurate data handling.
