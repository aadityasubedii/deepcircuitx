Module name: SDRAM. Module specification: The SDRAM module interfaces with Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) to perform read and write operations. It handles address generation, data transfer, and command signaling to the SDRAM. The inputs include `input_clk` as the primary clock, `sys_rst_n` for resetting the module, and `clk_Key_2` used for reading operations. Output ports such as `Sa`, `Ba`, `Cs_n`, `Cke`, `Ras_n`, `Cas_n`, `We_n` manage address, bank, and command signals to the SDRAM, while `Dq` serves as the bi-directional data bus, and `Dqm` is the data mask. Additionally, `segs` show data on a seven-segment display, and `clk_400M` and `sdram_clk` are clock outputs generated by the PLL.

Internal signals including `sys_clk` and derived clock signals like `Wr_clk` and `Rd_clk` synchronize write and read operations, respectively. `Wr_data` and `Rd_data` hold the data to be written to and read from the SDRAM. Control signals like `Wr_en`, `Rd_en` and other flags and counters like `rx_flag`, `address`, and `rx_flag_count` manage data transfer and address sequencing.

The module integrates several key components: the `sdram_control_top` for interfacing directly with the SDRAM, a `pll` instance for clock management, and simple blocks like `rom` and `counter` for generating write data and addresses respectively. A `seven_segment_LED` instance displays the read data, enhancing the module's interactivity and visibility in applications. This structured approach ensures efficient and synchronized memory operations essential for larger systems requiring dynamic memory management.
