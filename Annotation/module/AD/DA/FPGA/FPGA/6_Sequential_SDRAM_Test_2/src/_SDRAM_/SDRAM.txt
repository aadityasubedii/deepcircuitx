Module-level comment: The SDRAM module manages read/write operations with SDRAM, utilizing an internal PLL for clock generation and synchronization. It uses `sdram_control_top` for direct memory interfacing, a `rom` and `counter` for address and data sequencing, and displays read data on a seven-segment LED. Inputs control reset and clocking while outputs interface with the SDRAM.
