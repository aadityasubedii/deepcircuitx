Module-level comment: The 'sdram_init' module initializes an SDRAM by sequencing commands based on internal timers. It monitors 'Clk' and 'Rst_n' to manage a control flow, using a counter 'init_cnt' to emit 'Command' signals at precise times dictated by pre-defined parameters (`init_PRE_TIME`, `init_AREF1_TIME`, etc.). Outputs include 'Command', 'Saddr', and 'Init_done' to indicate completion, ensuring SDRAM is prepared for operational use following strict timing protocols essential for its setup.
