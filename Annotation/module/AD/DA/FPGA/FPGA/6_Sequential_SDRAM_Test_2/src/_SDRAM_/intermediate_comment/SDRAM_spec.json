    "spec": "Module name: SDRAM. Module specification: The SDRAM module interfaces with Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) to perform read and write operations. It handles address generation, data transfer, and command signaling to the SDRAM. The inputs include `input_clk` as the primary clock, `sys_rst_n` for resetting the module, and `clk_Key_2` used for reading operations. Output ports such as `Sa`, `Ba`, `Cs_n`, `Cke`, `Ras_n`, `Cas_n`, `We_n` manage address, bank, and command signals to the SDRAM, while `Dq` serves as the bi-directional data bus, and `Dqm` is the data mask. Additionally, `segs` show data on a seven-segment display, and `clk_400M` and `sdram_clk` are clock outputs generated by the PLL.\n\nInternal signals including `sys_clk` and derived clock signals like `Wr_clk` and `Rd_clk` synchronize write and read operations, respectively. `Wr_data` and `Rd_data` hold the data to be written to and read from the SDRAM. Control signals like `Wr_en`, `Rd_en` and other flags and counters like `rx_flag`, `address`, and `rx_flag_count` manage data transfer and address sequencing.\n\nThe module integrates several key components: the `sdram_control_top` for interfacing directly with the SDRAM, a `pll` instance for clock management, and simple blocks like `rom` and `counter` for generating write data and addresses respectively. A `seven_segment_LED` instance displays the read data, enhancing the module's interactivity and visibility in applications. This structured approach ensures efficient and synchronized memory operations essential for larger systems requiring dynamic memory management.",

It utilizes various control signals such as address (`Sa` and `Ba`), command signals (`Cs_n`, `Cke`, `Ras_n`, `Cas_n`, `We_n`), and data (`Dq`, `Dqm`) to interface with the SDRAM. The module also contains a phase-locked loop (PLL) to generate required clock signals and controls to manage data flow (`Wr_data`, `Rd_data`) and addresses for reading and writing. The module actively responds to external clock input and reset signals, ensuring synchronized operation in a larger system, such as accessing and storing data in memory mapped to certain addresses. Additionally, there are mechanisms for clock management and data transfer control, hinted by instantiation of other modules like `sdram_control_top`, `rom`, `counter`, and `seven_segment_LED` for displaying read data.

                    "text": "Module name: SDRAM. Module specification: The SDRAM module interfaces with Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) to perform read and write operations. It handles address generation, data transfer, and command signaling to the SDRAM. The inputs include `input_clk` as the primary clock, `sys_rst_n` for resetting the module, and `clk_Key_2` used for reading operations. Output ports such as `Sa`, `Ba`, `Cs_n`, `Cke`, `Ras_n`, `Cas_n`, `We_n` manage address, bank, and command signals to the SDRAM, while `Dq` serves as the bi-directional data bus, and `Dqm` is the data mask. Additionally, `segs` show data on a seven-segment display, and `clk_400M` and `sdram_clk` are clock outputs generated by the PLL.\n\nInternal signals including `sys_clk` and derived clock signals like `Wr_clk` and `Rd_clk` synchronize write and read operations, respectively. `Wr_data` and `Rd_data` hold the data to be written to and read from the SDRAM. Control signals like `Wr_en`, `Rd_en` and other flags and counters like `rx_flag`, `address`, and `rx_flag_count` manage data transfer and address sequencing.\n\nThe module integrates several key components: the `sdram_control_top` for interfacing directly with the SDRAM, a `pll` instance for clock management, and simple blocks like `rom` and `counter` for generating write data and addresses respectively. A `seven_segment_LED` instance displays the read data, enhancing the module's interactivity and visibility in applications. This structured approach ensures efficient and synchronized memory operations essential for larger systems requiring dynamic memory management."
