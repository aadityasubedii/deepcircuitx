    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_control` module interfaces with SDRAM, managing initialization, refresh cycles, and data transactions based on SDRAM specifications. It employs a finite state machine with input signals for operations and control, uses internal counters and state-specific tasks like `auto_ref`, `write_data`, and `read_data` to execute SDRAM commands, and manages timing through state transitions. The design ensures reliable SDRAM operation following strict timing and protocol rules."
