Module name: sdram_init. 

Module specification: The 'sdram_init' module is responsible for the initialization of an SDRAM module, coordinating this process via a series of predefined commands sent at specific timings. It operates with two input ports: 'Clk' (clock signal) for synchronization of operations and 'Rst_n' (reset, active low) for initializing the module's state. The outputs include a 4-bit 'Command' to deliver initialization commands, an SDRAM address bus 'Saddr', and a boolean 'Init_done' indicating the end of the initialization sequence. It utilizes internal signals such as a 16-bit counter 'init_cnt' to manage the timing of initialization commands based on defined times like 'init_PRE_TIME', 'init_AREF1_TIME', 'init_AREF2_TIME', 'init_LMR_TIME', and 'init_END_TIME'. In the Verilog code, two key always blocks manage the timing and control: the first block updates the 'init_cnt' counter on each positive clock edge or reset condition, while the second block controls the output states 'Command' and 'Saddr' depending on the value of 'init_cnt'. This module effectively encapsulates the initialization logic needed for setting up SDRAM for operation, adhering to specified timing sequences essential for correct SDRAM setup.
