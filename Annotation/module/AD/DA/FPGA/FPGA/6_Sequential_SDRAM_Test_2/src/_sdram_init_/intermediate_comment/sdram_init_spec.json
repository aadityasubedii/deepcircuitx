    "spec": "Module name: sdram_init. \n\nModule specification: The 'sdram_init' module is responsible for the initialization of an SDRAM module, coordinating this process via a series of predefined commands sent at specific timings. It operates with two input ports: 'Clk' (clock signal) for synchronization of operations and 'Rst_n' (reset, active low) for initializing the module's state. The outputs include a 4-bit 'Command' to deliver initialization commands, an SDRAM address bus 'Saddr', and a boolean 'Init_done' indicating the end of the initialization sequence. It utilizes internal signals such as a 16-bit counter 'init_cnt' to manage the timing of initialization commands based on defined times like 'init_PRE_TIME', 'init_AREF1_TIME', 'init_AREF2_TIME', 'init_LMR_TIME', and 'init_END_TIME'. In the Verilog code, two key always blocks manage the timing and control: the first block updates the 'init_cnt' counter on each positive clock edge or reset condition, while the second block controls the output states 'Command' and 'Saddr' depending on the value of 'init_cnt'. This module effectively encapsulates the initialization logic needed for setting up SDRAM for operation, adhering to specified timing sequences essential for correct SDRAM setup.",

This initialization sequence is dictated by a series of timing parameters and command definitions specified in \"Sdram_Params.h\".\n\nThe module monitors the clock (Clk) and reset (Rst_n) signals. In response to a negated reset (active low), it starts a counter (init_cnt) which increments on each clock cycle until it reaches a preset end time (init_END_TIME). Once this end time is reached, the counter is reset, thus dictating the overall timing sequence for the initialization process.\n\nDuring the incrementing of the initialization counter, specific commands are sent out at predetermined times. These commands, indicated by the values of the 'Command' signal, are as follows:\n\n1. A Precharge (C_PRE) command accompanied by setting the SDRAM address's tenth bit (Saddr[10]) at the time designated by init_PRE_TIME.\n2. An Auto Refresh (C_AREF) command issued at both init_AREF1_TIME and init_AREF2_TIME.\n3. A Mode Set Register (C_MSET) command, where the SDRAM address (Saddr) is loaded with various parameters such as operation code, burst type, burst length, and CAS latency at init_LMR_TIME.\n4. A No Operation (C_NOP) command is set as the default 'Command' outside the specific initialization timings. \n\nA signal labeled Init_done is assigned and goes high (logic '1') when the initialization counter reaches the end time (init_END_TIME), indicating the completion of the initialization sequence. The 'Command' and 'Saddr' signals are used to transmit the commands and any associated addresses or parameters to the SDRAM controller."

It is used to synchronize the internal operations, such as incrementing the initialization counter (init_cnt) and updating the states of the Command and Saddr outputs.\n- Rst_n: This is the reset input, active low, for the module. It initializes the state of the module, resetting the internal counter and outputs to their default values when asserted (logic low).\n\nOutput ports:\n- Command\n- Saddr\n- Init_done\n\nExplanation:\n- Command: This 4-bit output delivers specific initialization commands to the SDRAM at different times dictated by the counter's value. These commands include precharge, auto-refresh, mode set register, or no operation (NOP), which are crucial for the proper initialization sequence of the SDRAM.\n- Saddr: This output is the SDRAM address bus. Its width is determined by the `ASIZE` parameter from \"Sdram_Params.h\". It is used during initialization to provide the SDRAM with the required address or parameters associated with specific commands, such as the Mode Set Register command, where it carries burst type, burst length, and CAS latency settings.\n- Init_done: This digital output signal indicates the completion of the initialization sequence. It turns high (logic '1') when the initialization counter reaches the end time value (init_END_TIME), signaling that the SDRAM is ready for normal operation following the completion of its initialization routine."

It increments on each positive edge of the clock (Clk) as long as it is less than init_END_TIME or gets reset to zero when the reset (Rst_n) is active or the count reaches init_END_TIME. It essentially times the various stages of the SDRAM initialization sequence.\n  \n- init_PRE_TIME: A local parameter that indicates the time at which the precharge command (C_PRE) should be sent to the SDRAM during the initialization process.

It is computed using INIT_PRE, REF_PRE, REF_REF, and possibly the number of auto-refresh cycles to determine when to send the C_MSET command.\n  \n- init_END_TIME: A local parameter that specifies the count value indicating the end of the initialization process. The command register is set to no operation (C_NOP), and the Init_done signal is asserted when init_cnt reaches this value, signaling that initialization is complete. It is calculated by adding up the times for the precharge command, the two auto-refresh commands, and the mode set command with appropriate intervals in between them."
