Module name: pll. Module specification: The 'pll' module is a hardware component written in Verilog that acts as a wrapper for the 'pll_0002' phase-locked loop, facilitating the generation and synchronization of multiple clock signals with a reference clock. It includes input ports 'refclk' for the reference clock signal and 'rst' for resetting the PLL's internal state. The module features six output ports: 'outclk_0' through 'outclk_5', which provide the generated clock signals, as well as 'locked', an indicator of the PLL's lock status. There are no internal signals within this wrapper module, as it simply maps the top-level ports directly to the corresponding ports of the instantiated 'pll_0002' module. The code is divided into two main blocks: the module declaration with input and output ports, and the instantiation of 'pll_0002', where actual port connections are made. This straightforward structure allows for seamless integration and use of the PLL's clock management capabilities in larger digital designs.
