Module name: counter. Module specification: The 'counter' module is designed to manage count operations based on input signals, although the specific counting logic is not implemented in the provided code snippet. It includes three input ports and one output port. The input ports are: 'aclr', an asynchronous clear that resets the output to zero irrespective of the clock condition; 'clock', which serves as the timing pulse to potentially trigger counting operations on its edge; and 'cnt_en', a count enable signal that when set high allows the counter to change its state. The module features an output port `[15:0] q`, which is allocated for the 16-bit count value, theoretically allowing the counter to represent values from 0 to 65535. No internal signals or further implementation details are present in the code, indicating that the code snippet provided is purely the skeleton of the module's interface without the actual count logic or internal configurations detailed. There are no specific blocks or sections within this code other than the module declaration and port definitions, leaving the actual functionality and internal structure to be defined.
