Module name: pll_0002. Module specification: The 'pll_0002' is a Verilog module that encapsulates a phase-locked loop (PLL) designed to generate six different output clock frequencies derived from a single reference clock. This module employs an instance of 'altera_pll,' which is a configurable PLL component provided by the FPGA manufacturer, set to produce output clocks without using fractional VCO multipliers, operating in normal mode with a 50 MHz reference frequency. The input ports include 'refclk,' serving as the reference clock for the PLL, and 'rst,' a reset signal for reinitializing the PLL to a known state. It provides six distinct output clocks ('outclk_0' to 'outclk_5'), each with specific frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle configurations, catering to varied timing requirements. Additionally, it outputs a 'locked' signal indicating the PLL has locked onto the desired frequencies. Internally, the module does not declare any signals, as the 'altera_pll' instantiation manages all internal behaviors, which include frequency synthesis, division, and phase shifting, ensuring the output clocks meet the design specifications. The internal inputs and outputs of the 'altera_pll' instance directly map the module's external ports to internal ones, without defining extra internal signals, with the exception of 'fboutclk' and 'fbclk' that interact with the PLL's feedback mechanism; the latter being tied to a constant low. The module is organized into a single block where the principal functional element is the 'altera_pll' instance, characterizing the PLL's properties such as output clock frequencies, phase shifts, duty cycles, operation mode, and pll_type for synthesis and operation.
