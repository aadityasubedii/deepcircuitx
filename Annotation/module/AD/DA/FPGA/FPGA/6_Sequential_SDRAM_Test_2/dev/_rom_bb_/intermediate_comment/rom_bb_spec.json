    "spec": "Module name: rom.\nModule specification: The 'rom' module is intended to represent a read-only memory component in a digital system, primarily for the purpose of storing and providing data that does not change during operation. The module has two input ports: a 16-bit 'address' input, which is used to select one of the 64K (2^16) possible memory locations in the ROM from which data should be read, and a 1-bit 'clock' input, which is likely used to synchronize the read operations. There is a single 8-bit output port named 'q', which provides the data stored at the memory location specified by the 'address' input, with read operations typically timed according to the 'clock' signal. No internal signals are explicitly declared within this snippet of the module, suggesting that the control logic and ROM's memory array might be defined elsewhere. The presence of \"`ifndef ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS ... `endif`\" and \"tri1 clock;\" indicate conditional compilation for Altera FPGA device support to facilitate appropriate handling of the clock signal and ensure compatibility with Quartus II synthesis optimizations. Further code, not included in this snippet, would be necessary to fully define the detailed operations of the 'rom' module.",
