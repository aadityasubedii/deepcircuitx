    "spec": "Module name: pll. Module specification: The 'pll' module is a hardware component written in Verilog that acts as a wrapper for the 'pll_0002' phase-locked loop, facilitating the generation and synchronization of multiple clock signals with a reference clock. It includes input ports 'refclk' for the reference clock signal and 'rst' for resetting the PLL's internal state. The module features six output ports: 'outclk_0' through 'outclk_5', which provide the generated clock signals, as well as 'locked', an indicator of the PLL's lock status. There are no internal signals within this wrapper module, as it simply maps the top-level ports directly to the corresponding ports of the instantiated 'pll_0002' module. The code is divided into two main blocks: the module declaration with input and output ports, and the instantiation of 'pll_0002', where actual port connections are made. This straightforward structure allows for seamless integration and use of the PLL's clock management capabilities in larger digital designs.",

It is designed to take an input reference clock signal ('refclk') and generate multiple output clock signals ('outclk_0' through 'outclk_5') that are related in frequency and phase to the input clock. It also provides an output signal ('locked') indicating when the PLL has achieved and is maintaining the desired frequency and phase relationships. This module is likely used in digital circuits to generate multiple clock domains or to manage clock timing for operations that require specific clock frequencies. The 'rst' input is for resetting the PLL. The time scale directive at the beginning indicates the simulation time units and precision."

Explanation: This is the input signal to which the PLL is synchronized. It serves as the basis for generating the multiple output clock signals.\n- `rst`: Reset. Explanation: This input is used to reset the PLL. When activated, it brings the PLL to a known initial state.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `outclk_0`: Output Clock 0. Explanation: This is one of the six output clock signals generated by the PLL. Its frequency and phase are controlled by the PLL settings and are related to the reference clock.\n- `outclk_1`: Output Clock 1. Explanation: Similar to `outclk_0`, this is another output clock signal from the PLL.\n- `outclk_2`: Output Clock 2. Explanation: Another one of the six output clocks, providing additional frequency and phase configurations.\n- `outclk_3`: Output Clock 3. Explanation: An additional output clock, offering more clocking options for various parts of the digital system.\n- `outclk_4`: Output Clock 4. Explanation: Another output clock generated by the PLL for use in different clock domains or for tasks requiring distinct frequencies.\n- `outclk_5`: Output Clock 5. Explanation: The last of the six output clocks provided by the PLL.\n- `locked`: Locked Indicator. Explanation: This output signals whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the reference clock signal. When 'high', it indicates that the output clocks are stable and that the PLL is functioning correctly."
