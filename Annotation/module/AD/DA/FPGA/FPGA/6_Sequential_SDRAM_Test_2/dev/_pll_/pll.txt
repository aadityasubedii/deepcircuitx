Module-level comment: The 'pll' module is a Verilog wrapper for 'pll_0002', designed to synchronize and generate multiple clock signals from a reference clock ('refclk'). It manages six outputs ('outclk_0' to 'outclk_5') and a lock status ('locked'). This module is implemented by directly mapping the input ('refclk', 'rst') and output ports to the instantiated 'pll_0002', facilitating streamlined integration into digital systems without internal signal manipulation.
