    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'counter' module is a 16-bit upward counter using an LPM_COUNTER component, configured for asynchronous reset (`aclr`), and enabled by `cnt_en` and `clock` inputs. It employs `sub_wire0` for connecting the component's count output to the `q` output port, facilitating controlled counting operations."
