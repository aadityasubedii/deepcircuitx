Module-level comment: The 'counter' module interface is designed for counting operations with undefined internal logic. It takes 'aclr' to asynchronously reset, 'clock' for timing, and 'cnt_en' to enable counting. A 16-bit 'q' output is intended for the count value. Implementation details are to be added within the moduleâ€™s body for complete functionality.
