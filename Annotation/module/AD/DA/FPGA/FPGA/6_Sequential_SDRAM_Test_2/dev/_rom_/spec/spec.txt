Module name: rom. Module specification: The 'rom' module serves as a read-only memory (ROM) that outputs an 8-bit data byte corresponding to a 16-bit input address. This is facilitated using an Altera-specific synchronous RAM component, configured as ROM with a memory initialization file (MIF). The module features two primary input ports: 'address', a 16-bit input specifying the ROM data's location, and 'clock', used for synchronizing read operations where its tri-state (`tri1`) generally holds a high value unless driven otherwise. The sole output port, 'q', presents the data located at the specified 'address', read during the positive edge of 'clock'. Internally, the module uses a wire 'sub_wire0', an 8-bit signal that connects the output of the 'altsyncram' component to the 'q' output port. The 'altsyncram_component' is instantiated as the primary memory component handling data storage and retrieval based on the input address and clock signals. This instantiation is detailed with additional parameters such as disabling address clearing, setting the operating mode to ROM, and defining data and address width sizes. These settings ensure the component precisely meets the ROM behavior specified in the module's design requirements, targeting Cyclone V FPGA family for optimal performance.
