This module uses an instance of 'altera_pll' which is configured to produce six different output clocks with specified frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles. The module takes a reference clock ('refclk') and a reset signal ('rst') as inputs. The outputs include six different clock signals ('outclk_0' to 'outclk_5') and a 'locked' signal indicating the PLL locking status. The PLL configuration is set to not use fractional VCO multipliers and operates in a normal mode, utilizing a 50 MHz reference frequency. Each output clock is configured with specific frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle, enabling versatile use in timing-critical applications."

It serves as the base frequency from which the PLL generates the various output clock frequencies. Typically, the stability and accuracy of the PLL's output clocks depend on the stability of this reference clock.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input signal. When asserted, it likely resets the internal state of the PLL to a known state, typically by bringing the PLL out of the locked state and resetting the internal counters and dividers.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, `outclk_3`, `outclk_4`, `outclk_5`, `locked`.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0` to `outclk_5`: These are the output clock signals from the PLL. Each is a clock signal with a frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle configured according to the parameters specified in the `altera_pll` instance. These clocks are used to drive synchronous logic in the FPGA at different frequencies and phases as required by the design.\n- `locked`: This is a status signal that indicates when the PLL has achieved lock. When `locked` is high, it typically signifies that the PLL's output frequencies are stable and within the expected thresholds of performance. This signal is often used to ensure other components in the system start operating after the PLL has achieved a stable state."
