    "spec": "Module name: pll_0002. Module specification: The 'pll_0002' is a Verilog module that encapsulates a phase-locked loop (PLL) designed to generate six different output clock frequencies derived from a single reference clock. This module employs an instance of 'altera_pll,' which is a configurable PLL component provided by the FPGA manufacturer, set to produce output clocks without using fractional VCO multipliers, operating in normal mode with a 50 MHz reference frequency. The input ports include 'refclk,' serving as the reference clock for the PLL, and 'rst,' a reset signal for reinitializing the PLL to a known state. It provides six distinct output clocks ('outclk_0' to 'outclk_5'), each with specific frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle configurations, catering to varied timing requirements. Additionally, it outputs a 'locked' signal indicating the PLL has locked onto the desired frequencies. Internally, the module does not declare any signals, as the 'altera_pll' instantiation manages all internal behaviors, which include frequency synthesis, division, and phase shifting, ensuring the output clocks meet the design specifications. The internal inputs and outputs of the 'altera_pll' instance directly map the module's external ports to internal ones, without defining extra internal signals, with the exception of 'fboutclk' and 'fbclk' that interact with the PLL's feedback mechanism; the latter being tied to a constant low. The module is organized into a single block where the principal functional element is the 'altera_pll' instance, characterizing the PLL's properties such as output clock frequencies, phase shifts, duty cycles, operation mode, and pll_type for synthesis and operation.",

This module uses an instance of 'altera_pll' which is configured to produce six different output clocks with specified frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles. The module takes a reference clock ('refclk') and a reset signal ('rst') as inputs. The outputs include six different clock signals ('outclk_0' to 'outclk_5') and a 'locked' signal indicating the PLL locking status. The PLL configuration is set to not use fractional VCO multipliers and operates in a normal mode, utilizing a 50 MHz reference frequency. Each output clock is configured with specific frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle, enabling versatile use in timing-critical applications."

It serves as the base frequency from which the PLL generates the various output clock frequencies. Typically, the stability and accuracy of the PLL's output clocks depend on the stability of this reference clock.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input signal. When asserted, it likely resets the internal state of the PLL to a known state, typically by bringing the PLL out of the locked state and resetting the internal counters and dividers.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, `outclk_3`, `outclk_4`, `outclk_5`, `locked`.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0` to `outclk_5`: These are the output clock signals from the PLL. Each is a clock signal with a frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle configured according to the parameters specified in the `altera_pll` instance. These clocks are used to drive synchronous logic in the FPGA at different frequencies and phases as required by the design.\n- `locked`: This is a status signal that indicates when the PLL has achieved lock. When `locked` is high, it typically signifies that the PLL's output frequencies are stable and within the expected thresholds of performance. This signal is often used to ensure other components in the system start operating after the PLL has achieved a stable state."
