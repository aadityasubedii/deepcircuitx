    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pll_0002' module is a Verilog implementation of a phase-locked loop (PLL) that generates six different output clocks from a reference clock using an 'altera_pll' instance. It takes a 50 MHz 'refclk' and a reset signal 'rst' as inputs, creating outputs 'outclk_0' to 'outclk_5' and a 'locked' status. The PLL configuration involves specific frequencies, phases, and duty cycles per output, managed internally by the instantiated 'altera_pll', aligning the module's functionality with critical timing applications."
