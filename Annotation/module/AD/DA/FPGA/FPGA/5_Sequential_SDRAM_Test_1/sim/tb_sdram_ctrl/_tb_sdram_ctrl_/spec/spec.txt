Module name: tb_sdram_ctrl.

Module specification: The `tb_sdram_ctrl` module serves as a testbench for verifying the functionality of an SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory) controller in a Verilog simulation environment. The module does not have conventional input and output ports as it is a testbench, but it interfaces with a simulated SDRAM controller and an SDRAM memory model. Internally, it uses signals such as `clk_50m`, `clk_100m`, and `clk_100m_shift` to provide different clock signals, and `locked` to indicate when these clocks are stabilized. The `rst_n` signal is used to manage the reset functionality, ensuring operations commence only once the clocks are stable. The testbench drives the SDRAM through interface signals such as `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`, `sdram_ba`, `sdram_addr`, and `sdram_dq`. Control signals `wr_en`, `wr_data_in`, and `rd_en` manage data writing and reading operations, monitoring appropriate acknowledgment signals `sdram_wr_ack` and `sdram_rd_ack`, as well as initialization completion through `init_end`.

The core of the testbench includes blocks that generate clock signals via `clk_gen` instantiated module, simulate an SDRAM controller via `sdram_ctrl` instantiated module, and use the `sdram_model_plus` instantiated module to represent the physical SDRAM hardware behavior. Initialization processes and signal handling for reset, write, and read operations are established with procedural blocks in the initial and always constructs, ensuring accurate simulation and validation of the SDRAM controller against timing requirements and operational correctness.
