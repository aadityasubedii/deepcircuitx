Module name: sdram_model_plus. Module specification: The sdram_model_plus module simulates a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) device with four banks, implementing various SDRAM operations and timing checks. It features input ports for address (Addr), bank address (Ba), clock (Clk), control signals (Cke, Cs_n, Ras_n, Cas_n, We_n), data mask (Dqm), and debug mode (Debug), along with a bidirectional data bus (Dq) for read and write operations. The module utilizes internal signals to manage bank states, row and column addresses, command decoding, and data transfer. Key components include memory arrays for each bank, address and command registers, burst counters, and various control flags. The code is structured into sections handling command decoding, timing checks, data read/write operations, auto
