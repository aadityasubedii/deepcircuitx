It models the behavior of a multi-bank SDRAM with configurable address and data widths. The module implements various SDRAM operations including activation, read, write, precharge, and refresh commands. It also handles burst operations, auto-precharge, and timing constraints such as RAS, CAS, and precharge delays. The module includes debug features for monitoring and logging SDRAM operations, as well as the ability to dump memory contents to files for analysis."
