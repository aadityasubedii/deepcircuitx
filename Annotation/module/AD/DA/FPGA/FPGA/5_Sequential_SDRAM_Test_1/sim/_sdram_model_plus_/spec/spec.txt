Module name: sdram_model_plus. Module specification: This module simulates a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) device with four banks, supporting various operations including read, write, auto-refresh, and mode register setting. It has input ports for data (Dq), address (Addr), bank address (Ba), clock (Clk), control signals (Cke, Cs_n, Ras_n, Cas_n, We_n), data mask (Dqm), and debug mode (Debug). The Dq port is bidirectional, serving as both input and output. Internal signals include memory banks (Bank0-3), address registers, command buffers, and various control flags. The module implements timing checks, burst operations, and auto-precharge functionality. It is divided into several blocks: command decoding, memory access, burst operations, and internal precharge handling. The
