    "module": "Module-level comment: The tb_sdram_init module is a testbench for SDRAM initialization, simulating clock generation and reset functionality. It generates system clocks at 50MHz, 100MHz, and a phase-shifted 100MHz with the clk_gen instance. A sdram_init instance sequences the initialization of the SDRAM, producing necessary commands and addresses, while the sdram_model_plus instance mimics SDRAM response based on the input signals. Internal signals ensure synchronization and orderly progression of the initialization process."
