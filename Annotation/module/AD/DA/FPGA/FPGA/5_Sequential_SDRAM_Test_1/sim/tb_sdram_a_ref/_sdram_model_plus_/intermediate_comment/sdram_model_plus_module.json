    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) device with four banks. It implements SDRAM operations including activate, read, write, precharge, and refresh commands. The module uses internal registers to track bank states, row/column addresses, and timing parameters. It performs data read/write operations, manages burst modes, and enforces SDRAM timing constraints. The implementation includes command decoding, address handling, data transfer logic, and automatic precharge functionality. It also provides debug output and memory dump capabilities for analysis."
