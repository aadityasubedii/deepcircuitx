Module name: sdram_model_plus. Module specification: This module simulates a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) device with four banks, implementing read and write operations, burst modes, and auto-precharge features. It has input ports for address (Addr), bank address (Ba), clock (Clk), clock enable (Cke), chip select (Cs_n), row address strobe (Ras_n), column address strobe (Cas_n), write enable (We_n), data mask (Dqm), and debug mode (Debug). The module uses an inout port (Dq) for bidirectional data transfer. Internal signals include bank arrays, address registers, command registers, and various control flags. The module is divided into sections for command decoding, memory operations, timing checks, and burst operations. It handles memory bank operations, address decoding, data input/output
