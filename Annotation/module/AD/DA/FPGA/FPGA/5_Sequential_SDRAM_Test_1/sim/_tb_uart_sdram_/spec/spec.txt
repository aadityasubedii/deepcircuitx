Module name: tb_uart_sdram.
Module specification:
The `tb_uart_sdram` module is a testbench designed to simulate and verify the interfacing between a UART communication protocol and SDRAM memory. It serves to ensure proper operations of sending test data from the UART receiver to SDRAM. The testbench includes the following input ports: `sys_clk`, the system clock used for module timing; `sys_rst_n`, an active-low system reset signal utilized for initializing the system; and `rx`, the UART receive line for serial data input. The output ports consist of `tx`, the UART transmit line; `sdram_clk`, the SDRAM clock signal; `sdram_cke`, the Clock Enable for SDRAM, which allows the SDRAM to enter low power mode; `sdram_cs_n`, the Chip Select, active-low, for SDRAM select; `sdram_cas_n`, the active-low Column Address Strobe; `sdram_ras_n`, the active-low Row Address Strobe; `sdram_we_n`, the active-low Write Enable signal; `sdram_ba`, the Bank Address bus; `sdram_addr`, the address bus for SDRAM operations; `sdram_dqm`, the Data Mask for SDRAM writes; and `sdram_dq`, a bidirectional data bus for SDRAM data transfer.

The internal signals mirror the output ports' descriptions and facilitate communication and control between the testbench (including the UART and control logic) and the SDRAM components. The simulation initiates by reading test data from an external file into an array. A system clock is generated with a periodic signal, and the system is reset before commencing test operations. The UART receiver line (`rx`) is driven with a sequence of bits to simulate the serial data input. Various tasks are defined for breaking down the operations of serial data transfer into individual bit handling, offering modular control of data parsing and transmission. Parameters for baud rate control and SDRAM module configuration are set with `defparam` to tailor the simulation to specific timing requirements and memory size. Instantiations of a `uart_sdram` module and a behavioral `sdram_model_plus` module connect the internal signals and parameters to emulate the UART-SDRAM interfacing environment and validate functionality through simulation.
