It includes instances of clock generation, SDRAM initialization, and SDRAM writing modules. The testbench initializes the SDRAM, and upon successful initialization, it begins a writing process where data is sequentially written into the SDRAM. The module makes use of various signals to control and monitor the writing process, such as handling the system clock, reset, and acknowledging the write operations. The functionality is validated through clock signal generation, and SDRAM commands are dynamically selected based on initialization state, ensuring proper sequencing and data integrity in memory operations."
