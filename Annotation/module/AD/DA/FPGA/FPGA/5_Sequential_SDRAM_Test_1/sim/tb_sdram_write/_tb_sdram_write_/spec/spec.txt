Module name: tb_sdram_write.

Module specification: The tb_sdram_write module acts as a testbench for simulating SDRAM write operations. It oversees the generation of system clocks and manages the initialization and writing processes to an SDRAM module. The input ports include `sys_clk` for driving the system timing and `sys_rst_n` for resetting the system. The output ports consist of clock signals (`clk_50m`, `clk_100m`, `clk_100m_shift`), a stable clock indicator `locked`, a reset signal `rst_n`, SDRAM initialization signals (`init_cmd`, `init_ba`, `init_addr`, `init_end`), SDRAM writing signals (`write_addr`, `write_ba`, `write_cmd`, `wr_sdram_data`, `wr_sdram_en`), and completion indicators (`wr_end`, `sdram_wr_ack`). Additionally, outputs to the SDRAM model include `sdram_addr`, `sdram_ba`, `sdram_cmd`, and `sdram_dq`.

Internal signals within the module involve `sys_clk` for the clock signal, `sys_rst_n` for the reset signal, `wr_en` as a write enable control, and `wr_data_in` for storing the data to be written to SDRAM.

The module features several internal blocks: `clk_gen` for generating system clocks, `sdram_init` for handling SDRAM initialization, `sdram_write` for managing the data writing process, and `sdram_model_plus` which represents the SDRAM model being interfaced with. These components are instrumental for simulating the complete process of writing to SDRAM, from initialization through to the actual write operation, and involve generating necessary clocks, sending commands, and handling data in accordance with SDRAM protocols.
