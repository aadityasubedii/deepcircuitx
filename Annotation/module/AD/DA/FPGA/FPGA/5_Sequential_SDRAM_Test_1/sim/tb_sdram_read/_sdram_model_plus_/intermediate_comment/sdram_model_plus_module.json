    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) device with four banks. It implements read, write, auto-refresh, precharge, and burst operations, adhering to SDRAM timing constraints. The module uses internal state machines to track bank status, process commands, and manage data transfer. It supports various burst lengths, CAS latencies, and auto-precharge modes, providing a comprehensive SDRAM model for system-level simulations and verification."
