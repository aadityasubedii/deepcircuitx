Module name: tb_sdram_top.

Module specification: The `tb_sdram_top` serves as a test bench for verifying the functionality of an SDRAM controller interface. It does not have traditional input and output ports since it generates simulation stimuli and monitors results internally. Key internal signals include `sys_clk` and `sys_rst_n`, which are the main system clock and active-low reset, respectively. Various enable signals like `wr_en` and `rd_en` control read and write operations, while flags such as `wr_data_flag` and `read_valid` indicate the readiness of data and validity of read operations. Counters `cnt_wr_wait` and `cnt_rd_data` help to manage the timing of these operations. Clock generator instance `clk_gen_inst` provides multiple clock signals (`clk_50m`, `clk_100m`, and `clk_100m_shift`) and a lock signal `locked` that indicate clock stability. Instantiation of `sdram_top_inst` creates and manages the SDRAM interface, handling initialization and data transfer with acknowledgment signals `sdram_wr_ack` and `sdram_rd_ack`. The `sdram_model_plus_inst` simulates the actual SDRAM using signals such as `sdram_clk`, `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, and others, representing the full range of control and data lines to the memory, with customization parameters set using `defparam`. The test bench initializes signals, generates a continuous clock, controls reset logic, executes write and read protocols, and instantiates both `sdram_top` and `sdram_model_plus` modules with proper connections for testing the SDRAM operations. The code is organized into initial block for signal initialization, always blocks for signal assignments and control, and module instantiations that handle specific functional aspects of the SDRAM testing scenario.
