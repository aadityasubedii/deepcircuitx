It models the behavior of an SDRAM chip, including read and write operations, burst modes, auto-precharge, and various timing parameters. The module implements four memory banks, each with configurable size and data width. It handles SDRAM commands such as activate, read, write, precharge, and refresh, while enforcing timing constraints and generating appropriate responses. The module also includes debugging features and can output memory contents to files for analysis."
