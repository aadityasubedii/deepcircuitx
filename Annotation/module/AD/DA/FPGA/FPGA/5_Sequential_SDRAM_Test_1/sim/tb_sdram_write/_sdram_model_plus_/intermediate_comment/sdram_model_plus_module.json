    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) device with four banks. It implements SDRAM operations including read, write, activate, precharge, and refresh, while enforcing timing constraints. The module uses input ports for control signals and an inout port for data transfer. It maintains internal state through registers and arrays, processes SDRAM commands, and manages data input/output operations. The module also includes debug features and can output memory contents to files for analysis."
