Module name: sdram_model_plus. Module specification: This module simulates a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) device with configurable address and data widths. It supports multiple banks, various SDRAM operations (activation, read, write, precharge, and refresh), and handles burst operations and auto-precharge. The module has input ports for data (Dq), address (Addr), bank address (Ba), clock (Clk), control signals (Cke, Cs_n, Ras_n, Cas_n, We_n), data mask (Dqm), and debug enable (Debug). The only output port is the bidirectional data bus (Dq). Internal signals include memory banks (Bank0-3), address registers, command decoders, and various control flags. The module is divided into several blocks: initialization, command decoding, timing checks, rea
