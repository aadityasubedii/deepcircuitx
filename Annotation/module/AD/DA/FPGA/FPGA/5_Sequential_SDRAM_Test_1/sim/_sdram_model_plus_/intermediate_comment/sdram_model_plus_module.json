    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates a 4-bank SDRAM device, implementing read/write operations, auto-refresh, and mode register setting. It models timing parameters, burst operations, and auto-precharge functionality. The module uses state machines to handle command decoding, memory access, and internal precharge. It supports various burst lengths and CAS latencies, and includes debug features for memory content dumping and timing violation checks."
