    "module": "Module-level comment: The `tb_sdram_ctrl` module simulates a test environment for an SDRAM controller. It handles clock generation for different frequencies and phases, manages reset logic, and enables read/write operations to the SDRAM. The module instantiates clock generator (`clk_gen`), SDRAM controller (`sdram_ctrl`), and SDRAM model (`sdram_model_plus`) to validate SDRAM operations against design specifications, observing initialization, write, and read acknowledgments."
