    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates an SDRAM device with four banks, implementing read, write, activate, precharge, and refresh operations. It handles timing constraints, burst operations, and auto-precharge functionality. The module uses internal memory arrays, address and command registers, and control flags to manage SDRAM operations. It processes input signals, updates internal states, and generates appropriate outputs based on SDRAM protocols and timing requirements."
