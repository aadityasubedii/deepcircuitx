Module-level comment: 
/* This module simulates a multi-bank SDRAM device with configurable address and data widths.
   It implements SDRAM operations including activation, read, write, precharge, and refresh.
   The module uses state machines to handle command decoding, timing checks, and burst operations.
   It also supports auto-precharge, manages internal banks, and enforces SDRAM timing constraints.
   Debug features allow for monitoring and logging of SDRAM operations and memory contents. */
