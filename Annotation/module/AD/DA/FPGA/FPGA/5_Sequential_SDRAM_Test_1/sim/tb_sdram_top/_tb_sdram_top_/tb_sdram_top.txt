Module-level comment: The `tb_sdram_top` module is a test bench for an SDRAM controller interface, simulating write and read operations to validate the functionality. It generates the system clock, initiates an active-low reset, and controls internal signals for write/read enablement and data handling. The module includes instantiation of a clock generator, SDRAM interface (`sdram_top`), and a memory model (`sdram_model_plus`) to thoroughly test SDRAM behavior under various scenarios. Test sequences and signal states are managed through sequential `always` blocks, while connectivity with the SDRAM and clock modules is established using internal signals and parameters.
