    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates an SDRAM device with four banks, implementing read/write operations, burst modes, and auto-precharge. It decodes commands, manages memory operations, performs timing checks, and handles burst operations. The module uses input ports for control signals and addresses, an inout port for data transfer, and internal signals to track bank states, addresses, and timing parameters. It achieves functionality through state machines, counters, and logic for command interpretation, memory access, and timing management."
