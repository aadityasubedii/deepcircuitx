It implements the behavior of a multi-bank SDRAM, including read and write operations, auto-refresh, precharge, and burst mode functionality. The module handles timing constraints, manages internal states of the memory banks, and processes various SDRAM commands such as activate, read, write, and precharge. It also includes features for debugging and data output to files for analysis purposes."
