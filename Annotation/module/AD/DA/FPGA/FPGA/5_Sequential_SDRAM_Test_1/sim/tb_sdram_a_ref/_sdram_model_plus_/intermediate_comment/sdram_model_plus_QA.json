It implements the behavior of an SDRAM, including bank operations, read/write operations, auto-precharge, burst modes, and timing checks. The module handles various SDRAM commands such as activate, read, write, precharge, and refresh. It also includes data input/output operations, burst counter management, and internal state tracking for each bank. Additionally, the module provides debug output and can dump memory contents to files for analysis."
