Module name: tb_sdram_read.
Module specification: The `tb_sdram_read` module is a testbench developed for verifying the SDRAM read operations within a specified system. This testbench does not have external I/O ports as it internally manages signals and assessments for the SDRAM unit under test. Key internal signals include `clk_50m`, `clk_100m`, and `clk_100m_shift` for different clocking requirements, `locked` signifying the stability of clocks, `rst_n` as a reset signal, and various command, data, and address signals like `init_cmd` and `read_addr` specifically tailored to orchestrate initialization, writing, and reading from an SDRAM. The module integrates several sub-modules including `clk_gen` for clock generation, `sdram_init` for handling initialization sequences, `sdram_write` and `sdram_read` for managing writing to and reading from the SDRAM respectively, and `sdram_model_plus` acting as the SDRAM device model. These sub-modules interact through meticulously managed signals aligning with SDRAM's operational protocols, ensuring systematic initialization followed by data handling through write and read sequences. Each component and signal is crucial for mimicking real-world SDRAM operations and verifying the correctness of SDRAM interfacing in simulation environments.
