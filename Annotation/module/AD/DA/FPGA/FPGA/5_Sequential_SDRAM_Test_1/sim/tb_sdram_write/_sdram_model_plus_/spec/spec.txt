Module name: sdram_model_plus. Module specification: The sdram_model_plus module simulates a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) device with four memory banks, configurable size, and data width. It handles SDRAM commands such as activate, read, write, precharge, and refresh while enforcing timing constraints. The module has input ports for address (Addr), bank address (Ba), clock (Clk), clock enable (Cke), chip select (Cs_n), row address strobe (Ras_n), column address strobe (Cas_n), write enable (We_n), data mask (Dqm), and debug mode (Debug). It uses an inout port (Dq) for bidirectional data transfer. Internal signals include memory bank arrays, address registers, command registers, and various control flags for managing SDRAM operations.
