Module name: tb_sdram_a_ref.

Module specification: The `tb_sdram_a_ref` module is a Verilog testbench designed for simulating the initialization and automatic refresh functionalities of Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (SDRAM). This module does not have explicit input or output ports as it serves as a testbench, generating stimuli for and monitoring the responses from the design under test (DUT) to ensure correct operation. Key internal signals include `sys_clk` and `sys_rst_n`, simulating the system clock and active-low system reset respectively; `aref_en`, controlling the enablement of the automatic refresh feature; `sdram_cmd`, `sdram_ba`, and `sdram_addr`, which monitor or simulate command, bank address, and address inputs to the SDRAM; and various clock signals (`clk_50m`, `clk_100m`, `clk_100m_shift`) generated to meet different system requirements. Additionally, `locked` and `rst_n` indicate the status of clock stabilization and the derived system reset. The testbench comprises several blocks: a clock generator (`clk_gen`) providing different clock signals, an SDRAM initialization module (`sdram_init`) setting up the SDRAM, an automatic refresh module (`sdram_a_ref`) controlling refresh cycles, and an SDRAM model (`sdram_model_plus`) simulating the actual SDRAM behavior. Throughout the simulation, the testbench initializes the SDRAM, manages clock signals, drives initialization and refresh sequences, and monitors the response of the SDRAM model to validate correct operation. Parameters such as address, data, and memory size are configured for the SDRAM model to closely match the intended application scenario.
