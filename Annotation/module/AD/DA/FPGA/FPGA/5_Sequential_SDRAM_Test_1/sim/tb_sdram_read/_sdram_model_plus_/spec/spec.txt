Module name: sdram_model_plus. Module specification: This module simulates a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) device with four banks, supporting various operations including read, write, auto-refresh, and precharge. It has input ports for data (Dq, inout), address (Addr), bank address (Ba), control signals (Clk, Cke, Cs_n, Ras_n, Cas_n, We_n), data mask (Dqm), and debug mode (Debug). The module uses internal signals to represent memory banks (Bank0-3), address registers (Bank_addr, Col_addr), command storage (Command), data masks (Dqm_reg0, Dqm_reg1), row addresses (B0_row_addr to B3_row_addr), mode register (Mode_reg), data registers (Dq
