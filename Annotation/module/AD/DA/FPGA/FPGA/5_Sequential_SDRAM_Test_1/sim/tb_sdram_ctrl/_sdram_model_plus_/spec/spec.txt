Module name: sdram_model_plus. Module specification: This module simulates a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) device with four banks, supporting various burst lengths and CAS latencies. It handles read, write, activate, precharge, and refresh operations, implementing timing constraints and auto-precharge functionality. The module has input ports for data (Dq), address (Addr), bank select (Ba), clock (Clk), control signals (Cke, Cs_n, Ras_n, Cas_n, We_n), data mask (Dqm), and debug mode (Debug). The bidirectional Dq port serves for both data input and output. Internal signals include memory banks (Bank0-3), address registers, command storage, data masks, and various control flags. The module is structured with sections for command decoding, timing checks, burst operations, and auto-
