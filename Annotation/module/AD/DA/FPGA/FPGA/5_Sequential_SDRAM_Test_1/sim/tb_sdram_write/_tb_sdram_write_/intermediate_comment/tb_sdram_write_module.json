    "module": "Module-level comment: The `tb_sdram_write` module simulates SDRAM write operations, functioning as a testbench. It inputs a system clock (`sys_clk`) and reset signal (`sys_rst_n`), generating various derived clocks and managing SDRAM initialization and writing via sub-modules (`clk_gen`, `sdram_init`, `sdram_write`). It controls writes through internal state and data manage signals (`wr_en`, `wr_data_in`), sending appropriate commands and data to the simulated SDRAM (`sdram_model_plus`)."
