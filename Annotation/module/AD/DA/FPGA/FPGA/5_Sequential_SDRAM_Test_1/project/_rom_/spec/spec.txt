Module name: rom.

Module specification: The 'rom' module encapsulates the functionality of a read-only memory (ROM) tailored for Cyclone V devices, using Altera's `altsyncram` primitive. The module features a simple interface comprising a 16-bit input port 'address' for selecting the memory location, and a clock input 'clock' to synchronize the data reads. The output port 'q' is an 8-bit bus that carries the data retrieved from the specified address. Internally, the signal 'sub_wire0' is utilized as a conduit to transfer the data from the `altsyncram` component to the 'q' output port. The module code is structured around defining the input and output ports, declaring internal signals, and instantiating the `altsyncram` primitive with specific configurations like disabling asynchronous clear signals ('aclr0', 'aclr1') and other signal attributes that cater to ROM usage. Configuration parameters for the `altsyncram` component are set using `defparam` to outline the ROM's attributes, such as the initialization file (`init_file` set to "../sim/ADC_1.mif"), intended device family ('Cyclone V'), and ROM-specific operation modes. These settings detail the behavior of the memory, including its size, data width, address range, and the strategy for output data registration, ensuring that it operates as a fixed ROM without runtime modification capabilities.
