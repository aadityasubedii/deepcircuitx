    "spec": "Module name: rom.\n\nModule specification: The 'rom' module encapsulates the functionality of a read-only memory (ROM) tailored for Cyclone V devices, using Altera's `altsyncram` primitive. The module features a simple interface comprising a 16-bit input port 'address' for selecting the memory location, and a clock input 'clock' to synchronize the data reads. The output port 'q' is an 8-bit bus that carries the data retrieved from the specified address. Internally, the signal 'sub_wire0' is utilized as a conduit to transfer the data from the `altsyncram` component to the 'q' output port. The module code is structured around defining the input and output ports, declaring internal signals, and instantiating the `altsyncram` primitive with specific configurations like disabling asynchronous clear signals ('aclr0', 'aclr1') and other signal attributes that cater to ROM usage. Configuration parameters for the `altsyncram` component are set using `defparam` to outline the ROM's attributes, such as the initialization file (`init_file` set to \"../sim/ADC_1.mif\"), intended device family ('Cyclone V'), and ROM-specific operation modes. These settings detail the behavior of the memory, including its size, data width, address range, and the strategy for output data registration, ensuring that it operates as a fixed ROM without runtime modification capabilities.",

It utilizes a memory initialization file (`.mif`) to preload data into the ROM. The ROM has a 16-bit address input, a single clock input, and an 8-bit data output. The functionality revolves around reading data from preloaded addresses synchronous to the clock signal. It's set up to bypass additional clock enable and asynchronous clear signals to simplify operation, hinting at a straightforward memory read use case without the need for dynamic configuration or power-saving states.
