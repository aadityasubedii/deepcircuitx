Module name: clk_gen. Module specification: The clk_gen is a Verilog module designed for generating multiple clock signals with configurable frequencies, duty cycles, and phase shifts. It accomplishes this by leveraging an AltPLL component from the FPGA vendor's library, key for synchronous circuit functionality. The module takes two principal inputs: `areset`, an asynchronous reset signal that reinitializes the PLL, and `inclk0`, the primary input clock signal upon which all output clocks are based. Outputs include four clock signals (`c0`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`), each customizable through the module, and a `locked` signal indicating the PLL's lock status. The module employs a series of internal wires (`sub_wire0` through `sub_wire8`), which are utilized for tasks such as aggregating the output clocks, directing output signals, and forming connections to the PLL input. The code is structured mainly around these inputs, outputs, and the AltPLL component configuration, using `defparam` to set parameters such as clock frequency, phase, and duty cycle. This allows the clk_gen module to function as a versatile clock generation tool within FPGA-based digital system designs.
