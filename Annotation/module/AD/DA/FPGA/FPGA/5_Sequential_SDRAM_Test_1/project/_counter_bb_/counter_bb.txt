Module-level comment: The "counter" module implements a synchronous counter with the capability to be asynchronously cleared ("aclr"), enabled ("cnt_en"), and clocked ("clock"). It outputs a 16-bit value ("q") reflecting its current state. The internal mechanism, such as counting logic, register for storing the count, and edge sensitivity, is not detailed in this snippet.
