Module name: fifo_data.
Module specification: The fifo_data module is a Verilog implementation of a dual-clock First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memory buffer intended for use with separate read (rdclk) and write (wrclk) clock domains. It is structured to bridge and synchronize data transmission between asynchronous systems, mitigating the risk of data corruption. This FIFO has input ports like aclr (asynchronous clear signal), data (16-bit input data), rdclk (read domain clock), rdreq (read request signal), wrclk (write domain clock), and wrreq (write request signal), and it also provides output ports such as q (16-bit output data), rdusedw (10-bit words ready to read), and wrusedw (10-bit words written to FIFO). Internally, the module utilizes the signals sub_wire0, sub_wire1, and sub_wire2, which serve as conduits for connecting the dcfifo_component to the corresponding module outputs. The FIFO operation is backed by a configurable `dcfifo_component` block catering to the Cyclone IV E FPGA family, with parameters set for a FIFO of 1024 words by 16-bit width, among other operational characteristics such as synchronization delays, overflow and underflow checking, and the utilization of embedded array blocks (EABs). The code is laid out to define the module and its I/O ports, instantiate the `dcfifo_component`, map the signals, and set the parameters for the FIFO's design and operation. Unconnected status signals such as rdempty, rdfull, wrempty, and wrfull are instantiated within the FIFO block, indicating the module's ability to monitor the FIFO status without external exposure.
