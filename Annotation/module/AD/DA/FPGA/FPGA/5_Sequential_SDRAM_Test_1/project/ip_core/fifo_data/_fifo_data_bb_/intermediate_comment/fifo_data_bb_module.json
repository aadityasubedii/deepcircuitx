    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"fifo_data\" module serves as a FIFO buffer managing 16-bit data elements, optimized for operations demanding sequential data handling. The interface comprises inputs for data manipulation and control (aclr, data, rdreq, wrreq, rdclk, wrclk), and outputs to monitor FIFO status (q, rdusedw, wrusedw). Actual functionality such as data writing, reading, and tracking internal state (full/empty status, data pointers) is abstractly managed, likely within external or omitted implementation blocks. This facilitates adaptable FIFO usage across varied digital system applications."
