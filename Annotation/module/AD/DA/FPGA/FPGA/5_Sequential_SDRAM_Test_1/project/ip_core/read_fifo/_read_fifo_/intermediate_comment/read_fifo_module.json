    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'read_fifo' module is a FIFO buffer managing 8-bit data for storage and retrieval, synchronized by a 'clock'. It interfaces with an scfifo component parameterized for 1024 words and specific to Cyclone IV E FPGA. Inputs include data, read, and write controls. Outputs provide data and fill status. The module leverages internal wiring and parameter definitions to facilitate precise FIFO operations such as overflow and underflow management."
