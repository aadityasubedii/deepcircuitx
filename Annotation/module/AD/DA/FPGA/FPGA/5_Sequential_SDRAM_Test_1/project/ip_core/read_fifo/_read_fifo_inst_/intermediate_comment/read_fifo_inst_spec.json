    "spec": "Module name: read_fifo. Module specification: The `read_fifo` module is designed to implement a standard FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer system which operates synchronously with the system's clock signal, thereby managing the data flow in a sequential manner. The module's input ports include `clock`, `data`, `rdreq`, and `wrreq`. The `clock` port synchronizes the entire FIFO operation, `data` receives the binary information to be stored, `rdreq` initiates a data read operation, and `wrreq` triggers a data write into the FIFO. For outputs, the module utilizes `q` to dispatch data from the FIFO during read operations and `usedw` to indicate the current volume of data stored within the FIFO, essentially quantifying the FIFO's fill level. The internal workings or signals within the module aren't detailed in the provided snippet, suggesting the need for the full module definition to understand its intrinsic architecture and internal signal utilization. The code prominently describes the interface connections to external environments without detailing internal processing blocks or implementations such as data storage, pointer management or status flag operations essential for FIFO functionality. This high-level description underscores the module\u2019s role in buffering data within specified control signals ensuring controlled data throughput in hardware systems.",
