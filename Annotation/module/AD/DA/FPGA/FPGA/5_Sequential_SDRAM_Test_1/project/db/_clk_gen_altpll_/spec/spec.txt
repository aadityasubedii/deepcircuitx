Module name: clk_gen_altpll.
Module specification: The clk_gen_altpll module utilizes phase-locked loops (PLLs) to generate a variety of clock signals with different frequencies and duty cycles. The module takes in an asynchronous reset signal, `areset`, and a reference clock signal array, `inclk`, with two bits. The asynchronous reset is used to reset the state of PLLs when high, and the reference clock provides the timing reference for the PLLs. The output is a 5-bit clock signal array, `clk`, which includes the generated clocks from each PLL. In addition, the first PLL instance outputs a feedback clock, `fbout`, and a lock signal, `locked`, to indicate the PLL has stabilized. Internal signals such as `wire_generic_pll1_fboutclk`, `wire_generic_pll1_locked`, `wire_generic_pll1_outclk`, `wire_generic_pll2_outclk`, `wire_generic_pll3_outclk`, `wire_generic_pll4_outclk`, and `fb_clkin` serve to route feedback and output clock signals within the module as well as to signal lock status. The module is divided into sections: the declaration of inputs and outputs, setting of default tri-states, and internal signal declarations set the groundwork for the module's interface. The instantiation of four `generic_pll` blocks with respective defparam settings configures the individual PLLs, each with its own set of parameters for output frequency, duty cycle, phase shift, and reference clock frequency. Finally, the output signal assignments tie together the individual PLL outputs into the module's clock output bus and properly route the first PLLâ€™s feedback signal, while conveying the lock status. This modular design allows for flexible clock generation tailored to the requirements of FPGA implementations needing multiple derived clock frequencies.
