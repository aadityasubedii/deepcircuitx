Module-level comment: The "rom" module represents a placeholder for a read-only memory block, outputting 8-bit data for a given 16-bit address on a clock edge. As a skeletal code, the implementation of memory storage and data retrieval logic is absent, requiring additional internal signals and logic definition to function.
