    "module": "Module-level comment: The `read_fifo` module implements a synchronous FIFO buffer, managing sequential data storage and retrieval. It interfaces through `clock`, `data`, `rdreq`, and `wrreq` inputs for synchronized operations and data handling, with `q` and `usedw` outputs for data output and fill level indication. The module's internal design and signal management, essential for FIFO operations, are encapsulated, emphasizing modular abstraction."
