Module-level comment: The fifo_data module implements a dual-clock FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer with separate read (rdclk) and write (wrclk) clock domains to ensure reliable data transfer across asynchronous systems. Utilizing a dcfifo_component configured for Cyclone IV E FPGA, this module provides responsive FIFO operations with 1024 x 16-bit storage, managed through signals like aclr, data, rdreq, and wrreq. Internal wiring and parameter definitions within the module encapsulate detailed control over data integrity and synchronization.
