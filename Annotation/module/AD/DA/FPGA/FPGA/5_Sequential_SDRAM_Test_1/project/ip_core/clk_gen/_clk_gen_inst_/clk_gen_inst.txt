Module-level comment: The `clk_gen` module is designed as a clock generator that creates multiple synchronized clock outputs from a single input clock. It handles an asynchronous reset for reliable operations. Internally, the module links external signals (areset, inclk0) to internal signals and generates four distinct clock outputs (c0, c1, c2, c3) along with a lock signal indicating output stability. The instantiation abstracts internal workings, focusing on high-level module usage and connections.
