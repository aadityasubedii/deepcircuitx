    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'clk_gen' module generates multiple configurable clock signals using an AltPLL component from the FPGA library. It receives an asynchronous reset and an input clock (`areset`, `inclk0`), producing four output clocks (`c0` to `c3`) and a lock status (`locked`). Internally, it uses wires (`sub_wire0` to `sub_wire8`) to manage PLL outputs and configuration, set by `defparam` for customized frequencies, phases, and duty cycles."
