Module name: read_fifo.
Module specification: The 'read_fifo' module implements a first-in, first-out (FIFO) buffer designed to store and manage 8-bit data words in a sequential manner, as typically used in digital systems requiring temporary data storage. This hardware module, intended for a Cyclone IV E FPGA, interfaces with an external scfifo component, parameterized to hold 1024 words each of 8 bits. It is synchronized by the input 'clock' which ensures that data is transferred on its edges. The module accepts an 8-bit 'data' input for potential storage while 'rdreq' and 'wrreq' signals indicate read and write requests, respectively. On the output side, the module provides an 8-bit 'q' for the FIFO's data output and a 10-bit 'usedw' to indicate the FIFO's fill level. Internally, 'sub_wire0' and 'sub_wire1' serve to interface with the scfifo component by carrying the word count and data output to the 'read_fifo' outputs. The code comprises the module declaration, I/O port definitions, internal signal wirings, instantiation of the scfifo component with specific parameters that define the FIFO's functionality such as the overflow and underflow checking, device family specifications, the disabling of additional output registers, and FIFO size specifications. These parameters are set using defparam blocks to customize the behavior of the integrated scfifo component, ensuring that it operates as required for the specific application.
