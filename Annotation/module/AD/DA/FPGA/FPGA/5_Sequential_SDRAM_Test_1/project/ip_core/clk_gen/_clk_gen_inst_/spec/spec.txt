Module name: clk_gen.
Module specification: The clk_gen module is a clock generator for digital circuits, responsible for producing multiple clock signals at various frequencies or phase relationships derived from a single reference clock. It accepts an asynchronous reset (areset) and an input clock (inclk0) as input ports. The areset signal allows the module to be reset into a known state, independent of the clock, ensuring robust operation even during external fault conditions. The inclk0 is the primary clock source for the module. The output ports of the module include c0, c1, c2, and c3, each representing clock output signals with unique characteristics in frequency or phase, and a locked signal which serves as an indicator of the clock stability. The internal signals like areset_sig, inclk0_sig, c0_sig, c1_sig, c2_sig, c3_sig, and locked_sig correspond to the module's inputs and outputs, facilitating the flow of data within the clock generation logic. The Verilog code suggests a module instantiation without detailing the internal architecture, implying it's a higher-level abstraction where the functionality of generating the specified output clocks and the lock signal is encapsulated. The clk_gen module thereby functions to provide synchronized clocking solutions for various parts of a larger digital system.
