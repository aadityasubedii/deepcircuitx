Module-level comment: The 'clk_gen' module is a template for clock signal generation, with input ports for asynchronous reset ('areset') and an input clock ('inclk0'). It defines outputs for four clock signals ('c0' to 'c3') and a 'locked' status signal. Lacking internal logic, the module requires further implementation to perform clock management and generation functions.
