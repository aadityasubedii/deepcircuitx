    "spec": "Module name: clk_gen_altpll.\nModule specification: The clk_gen_altpll module utilizes phase-locked loops (PLLs) to generate a variety of clock signals with different frequencies and duty cycles. The module takes in an asynchronous reset signal, `areset`, and a reference clock signal array, `inclk`, with two bits. The asynchronous reset is used to reset the state of PLLs when high, and the reference clock provides the timing reference for the PLLs. The output is a 5-bit clock signal array, `clk`, which includes the generated clocks from each PLL. In addition, the first PLL instance outputs a feedback clock, `fbout`, and a lock signal, `locked`, to indicate the PLL has stabilized. Internal signals such as `wire_generic_pll1_fboutclk`, `wire_generic_pll1_locked`, `wire_generic_pll1_outclk`, `wire_generic_pll2_outclk`, `wire_generic_pll3_outclk`, `wire_generic_pll4_outclk`, and `fb_clkin` serve to route feedback and output clock signals within the module as well as to signal lock status. The module is divided into sections: the declaration of inputs and outputs, setting of default tri-states, and internal signal declarations set the groundwork for the module's interface. The instantiation of four `generic_pll` blocks with respective defparam settings configures the individual PLLs, each with its own set of parameters for output frequency, duty cycle, phase shift, and reference clock frequency. Finally, the output signal assignments tie together the individual PLL outputs into the module's clock output bus and properly route the first PLL\u2019s feedback signal, while conveying the lock status. This modular design allows for flexible clock generation tailored to the requirements of FPGA implementations needing multiple derived clock frequencies.",

It takes an asynchronous reset signal (`areset`) and a set of input clock signals (`inclk`) and outputs multiple clock signals (`clk`) with different frequencies. There are 4 internal `generic_pll` instances, each producing a separate output clock. The first PLL also provides a feedback output clock (`fbout`) and a lock signal (`locked`) indicating that the PLL has achieved frequency and phase lock. The output clocks have specified duty cycles and frequencies, and the third PLL also includes a phase shift. The `areset` and `inclk` signals are tri-stated, which gives them a default value of '0' when not driven. Parameters like duty cycle, output clock frequency, phase shift, and reference clock frequency are configured for each PLL instance. The output clock signals are combined into a single 5-bit bus, with one of the bits forced to '0'. The module can be used in FPGA designs that require precise and stable clock generation with various frequencies derived from a reference clock."
