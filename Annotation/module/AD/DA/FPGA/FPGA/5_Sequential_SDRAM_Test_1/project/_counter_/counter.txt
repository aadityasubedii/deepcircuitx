Module-level comment: The 'counter' module is a 16-bit up counter that increments its value with each clock rising edge when enabled via 'cnt_en'. It resets with an asynchronous 'aclr'. Implemented with an LPM_COUNTER_component set for upward count, connections include direct outputs to 'q' and internal use of 'sub_wire0' for interfacing.
