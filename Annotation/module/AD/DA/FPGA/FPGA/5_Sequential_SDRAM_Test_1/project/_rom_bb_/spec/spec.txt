Module name: rom. Module specification: The "rom" module is designed to function as a read-only memory in a digital circuit, where its primary role is to retrieve and output stored 8-bit data based on a 16-bit input address upon synchronization with a clock signal. The module includes two input ports: 'address', which is a 16-bit input signifying the memory location to be accessed, and 'clock', a standard signal used to synchronize the data retrieval operations. An 8-bit output port 'q' is also provided to output the retrieved data from the ROM. Since the snippet does not define any internal signals or memory elements, the specification lacks details on control logic, memory storage, and data handling mechanisms which are essential for a functional ROM. The code includes provisions for `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS`, which are placeholders for potential Quartus synthesis attributes but contain no actual content within the code block as shown. The module is distinctly divided into the port declaration section, the `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS` precompiler directive sections, and the module's end. However, without further internal design, the code serves as merely an outline for the ROM module, requiring a complete definition of its internal functionality to be operational.
