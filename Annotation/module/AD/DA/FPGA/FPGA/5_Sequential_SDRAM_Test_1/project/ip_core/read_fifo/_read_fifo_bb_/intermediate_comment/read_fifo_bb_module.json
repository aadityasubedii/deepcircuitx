    "module": "Module-level comment: The `read_fifo` module acts as a First In, First Out (FIFO) buffer, interfacing with systems through its sync `clock`. It accepts 8-bit `data` for storage on `wrreq` and outputs 8-bit `q` upon `rdreq`. The `usedw` output indicates the buffer fill level. Internal implementation to handle data storage, read/write pointers, and overflow/underflow is assumed but not present in the provided code snippet."
