Internal signals are typically used within a module for various purposes such as intermediate storage, state machine status, control signal generation, or data manipulation which are essential for the module's operation but are not exposed outside the module.\n\nHowever, I can hypothesize typical internal signals that might be used in a FIFO read module based on common design patterns for similar modules.

It helps the module determine from where to read the next piece of data.\n- `tail`: Similar to the head, this is a pointer or index, but it tracks the location where new data should be written into the FIFO buffer. It's used during write operations to place data at the correct position in the FIFO.\n- `empty`: This could be a flag or status signal indicating whether the FIFO is empty. It might be used to control the read operations, ensuring that no read attempts are made when the FIFO is empty.\n- `full`: This is a counterpart to the `empty` signal, indicating whether the FIFO is full. It is particularly important for write operations, signaling when the FIFO cannot accept more data.\n- `count`: This signal likely keeps track of the number of elements currently stored in the FIFO. It could be used internally to manage and update the `usedw` output port, which indicates the fill level of the FIFO to the outside world.\n- `buffer`: This represents the actual storage memory of the FIFO. It's typically implemented as a register array or memory block. Data from the `data` input port is written into this buffer based on the `tail` index, and data is read out from this buffer through the `q` output port based on the `head` index.\n\nRemember, the exact implementation and choice of internal signals can vary significantly based on the specific requirements of the FIFO (e.g., its size, whether it's synchronous or asynchronous, single clock or dual clock, etc.), and the actual implementation details are needed to precisely define and explain the internal signals used."
