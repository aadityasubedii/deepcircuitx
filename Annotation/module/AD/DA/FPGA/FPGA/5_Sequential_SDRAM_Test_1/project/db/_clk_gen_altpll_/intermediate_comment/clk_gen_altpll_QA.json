It takes an asynchronous reset signal (`areset`) and a set of input clock signals (`inclk`) and outputs multiple clock signals (`clk`) with different frequencies. There are 4 internal `generic_pll` instances, each producing a separate output clock. The first PLL also provides a feedback output clock (`fbout`) and a lock signal (`locked`) indicating that the PLL has achieved frequency and phase lock. The output clocks have specified duty cycles and frequencies, and the third PLL also includes a phase shift. The `areset` and `inclk` signals are tri-stated, which gives them a default value of '0' when not driven. Parameters like duty cycle, output clock frequency, phase shift, and reference clock frequency are configured for each PLL instance. The output clock signals are combined into a single 5-bit bus, with one of the bits forced to '0'. The module can be used in FPGA designs that require precise and stable clock generation with various frequencies derived from a reference clock."
