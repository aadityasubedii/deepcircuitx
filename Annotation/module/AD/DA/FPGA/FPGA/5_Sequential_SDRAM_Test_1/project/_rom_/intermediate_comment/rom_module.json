    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'rom' module implements a read-only memory for Cyclone V devices using Altera's `altsyncram` primitive. It reads 8-bit data based on a 16-bit address, synchronized with a clock signal. The module preloads data from a `.mif` file, specifying ROM parameters such as device family and operation mode. Internal signal 'sub_wire0' transfers data from `altsyncram` to the output port 'q', reflecting a straightforward memory read operation."
