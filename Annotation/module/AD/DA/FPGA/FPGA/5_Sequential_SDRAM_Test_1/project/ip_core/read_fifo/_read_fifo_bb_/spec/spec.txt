Module name: read_fifo.
Module specification: The `read_fifo` module is designed as a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer that manages data storage and retrieval synchronized to a system clock. It interfaces with external components through various input and output ports. The `clock` input synchronizes the FIFO's operations, ensuring that data reads and writes are performed in a time-coordinated manner. An 8-bit wide `data` input accepts the data words to be written into the FIFO upon the assertion of `wrreq`, a write-request signal. Concurrently, the `rdreq` signal can be asserted to trigger a data read operation, whereupon the 8-bit output port `q` presents the data word at the front of the FIFO. To monitor the fill level of the FIFO, a 10-bit output `usedw` provides the count of data words currently stored. While the provided code defines the ports, the internal signals and implementation details, such as internal registers, control logic, and data storage mechanisms, are absent. Therefore, no elaboration on internal signals or specific blocks of operation can be provided at this stage. Once fully implemented, the module is expected to contain logic for enqueueing/dequeueing data, managing pointers or counters for read and write positions, and handling overflow or underflow conditions, which would be subdivided into distinguishable code sections for modularity and clarity.
