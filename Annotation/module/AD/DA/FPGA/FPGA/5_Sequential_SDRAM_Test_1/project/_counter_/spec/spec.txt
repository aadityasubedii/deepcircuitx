Module name: counter. 

Module specification: The 'counter' module is a digital, 16-bit up counter designed to increment its count value with each rising edge of a clock signal when the count enable (cnt_en) signal is asserted. The module includes three input ports and one output port. The input ports are 'aclr', 'clock', and 'cnt_en'. 'aclr' is an asynchronous clear input that resets the counter to zero regardless of the clock signal, allowing for rapid reinitialization of the counter. 'clock' acts as the pacing signal for the counter, only allowing counts to increment at its rising edge if 'cnt_en' is also high. 'cnt_en' serves as a gating signal to either enable or hold the current counter value based on its state. The output port 'q' provides the current 16-bit count value. Internally, the module uses a signal 'sub_wire0' that connects the output of an instantiated LPM counter component (LPM_COUNTER_component) to the 'q' output port, facilitating the movement of the count value to the module's external interface. The code is organized into sections dedicated to declaring and defining module ports, internal connections, and the parameters and instantiation of the LPM counter component. This setup effectively configures the counter to increment on each appropriate clock pulse, ignoring the direction control typically seen in more complex counters, as evidenced by the parameter settings ensuring unidirectional, upwards counting.
