Module name: fifo_read

Module specification: The 'fifo_read' module is designed to manage a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer in Verilog, primarily used for storing and retrieving data synchronously with a clock signal. It employs a synchronous FIFO component characteristic of operations such as data writing and reading controlled with `wrreq` (write request) and `rdreq` (read request) signals, respectively. Input ports include `clock`, a synchronizing signal for the FIFO operations; `data`, an 8-bit input specifying the data to be written into the FIFO; `rdreq`, which when asserted triggers data reading from FIFO onto the output `q`; and `wrreq`, which initiates writing the data present at the `data` input into FIFO. The output ports encompass `q`, an 8-bit output that holds the data read from FIFO, and `usedw`, a 10-bit output showing the count of words currently stored in the FIFO, aiding in the management to evade overflows and underflows. Two internal wires, `sub_wire0` and `sub_wire1`, are utilized to connect the FIFO component outputs to the module's outputs, with `sub_wire0` specifically mapping to the `usedw` output and `sub_wire1` mapping directly to the `q` output. The module integrates a vendor-specific FIFO component `scfifo_component`, which is configured within to align with the 'Cyclone IV E' FPGA architecture parameters, detailing aspects like FIFO depth and error checking functionalities. These settings have been captured in definitive parameters set with `defparam`. Thus, the `fifo_read` module succinctly encapsulates the FIFO operational mechanism facilitating controlled data flow within digital systems.
