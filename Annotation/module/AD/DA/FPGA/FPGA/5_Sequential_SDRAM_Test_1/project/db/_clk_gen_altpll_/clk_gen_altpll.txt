Module-level comment: The clk_gen_altpll module generates multiple clock signals with varying frequencies using 4 phase-locked loops (PLLs). It inputs an asynchronous reset and a reference clock, then outputs a 5-bit clock signal array, a feedback clock, and a lock status. The module integrates PLL instances with specified frequencies, duty cycles, and phase shifts, each contributing to the final clock signals. Internal wiring and parameters define the PLL behavior and output clocks, facilitating precise and diverse clock generation for FPGA designs.
