The instantiation of this module shows it taking an asynchronous reset signal (`areset_sig`), an input clock signal (`inclk0_sig`), and it outputs four different clock signals (`c0_sig`, `c1_sig`, `c2_sig`, `c3_sig`) and a lock signal (`locked_sig`).

It is used to reset the clock generator to a known state from an external condition, independently of the clock signal.\n- `inclk0`: Explanation: This is the primary input clock signal to the module. It is the reference clock from which the generated clocks (`c0`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`) are derived.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `c0`: Explanation: This is the first output clock signal generated by the `clk_gen` module. It is likely to have a specific frequency and phase relationship to the input clock `inclk0`.\n- `c1`: Explanation: This is the second output clock signal generated by the module. It may have a different frequency or phase compared to `c0` and is also derived from the `inclk0` signal.\n- `c2`: Explanation: This is the third output clock signal from the `clk_gen` module. It has its distinct frequency or phase settings as determined by the module's configuration.\n- `c3`: Explanation: This is the fourth and possibly the last of the output clock signals from the `clk_gen` module, with its unique frequency or phase characteristics.\n- `locked`: Explanation: This is a status output signal that indicates when the clock outputs (`c0`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`) are stable and the clock generator is operating within its specified parameters.
