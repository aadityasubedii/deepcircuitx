Module name: `sdram_init`. 

Module specification: The `sdram_init` module orchestrates the initialization sequence for SDRAM modules following power-up. This critical sequence is driven by a clock signal `sys_clk` and an active low reset `sys_rst_n`, which manipulate an internal state machine that progresses through states to output commands at precise timings. The output ports include a 4-bit command signal `init_cmd`, a 2-bit bank address `init_ba`, and a 13-bit address `init_addr` that cater to the requirements of the SDRAM control interface. A completion flag `init_end` indicates the end of the initialization process. Internal signals like `wait_end`, `trp_end`, `trc_end`, `tmrd_end`, among others, act as indicators and counters to manage the timing constraints such as precharge and auto-refresh periods mandated by SDRAM specifications. The code utilizes parameterized states and counters to ensure each step in the initialization sequence adheres to the required clock cycles, while consistently monitoring and resetting the necessary counters based on the current state. Commands are set according to the operational phase, where during waiting periods NOP commands are issued, while initialization relevant commands like precharge, auto-refresh, and mode register set are sequentially invoked as the state machine transits from the IDLE state towards the END state, effectively preparing the SDRAM for normal operation.
