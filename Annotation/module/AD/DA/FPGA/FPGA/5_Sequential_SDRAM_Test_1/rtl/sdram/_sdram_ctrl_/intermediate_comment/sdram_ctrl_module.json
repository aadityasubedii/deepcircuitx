    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_ctrl` module interfaces with SDRAM, enabling initialization, automatic refresh control, and read/write operations. It uses inputs like clock, reset, and command signals to manage internal operation states and external SDRAM command signaling through sub-modules for initialization (`sdram_init_inst`), arbitration (`sdram_arbit_inst`), auto-refresh (`sdram_a_ref_inst`), writing (`sdram_write_inst`), and reading (`sdram_read_inst`). These ensure synchronized data transactions, timely refresh cycles, and effective address and data handling, conforming to SDRAM protocol specifications."
