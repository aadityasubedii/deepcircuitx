    "spec": "Module name: `sdram_init`. \n\nModule specification: The `sdram_init` module orchestrates the initialization sequence for SDRAM modules following power-up. This critical sequence is driven by a clock signal `sys_clk` and an active low reset `sys_rst_n`, which manipulate an internal state machine that progresses through states to output commands at precise timings. The output ports include a 4-bit command signal `init_cmd`, a 2-bit bank address `init_ba`, and a 13-bit address `init_addr` that cater to the requirements of the SDRAM control interface. A completion flag `init_end` indicates the end of the initialization process. Internal signals like `wait_end`, `trp_end`, `trc_end`, `tmrd_end`, among others, act as indicators and counters to manage the timing constraints such as precharge and auto-refresh periods mandated by SDRAM specifications. The code utilizes parameterized states and counters to ensure each step in the initialization sequence adheres to the required clock cycles, while consistently monitoring and resetting the necessary counters based on the current state. Commands are set according to the operational phase, where during waiting periods NOP commands are issued, while initialization relevant commands like precharge, auto-refresh, and mode register set are sequentially invoked as the state machine transits from the IDLE state towards the END state, effectively preparing the SDRAM for normal operation.",

It uses a state machine, driven by a clock signal (`sys_clk`) and active low reset signal (`sys_rst_n`), to sequentially issue commands necessary for properly setting up the SDRAM after power-up. The sequence includes waiting for a power stabilization period, issuing precharge, auto refresh, and mode register set commands in specific order with precise timing controlled by counting clock cycles. The output signals `init_cmd`, `init_ba`, and `init_addr` are dynamically adjusted to issue these commands based on the current state of the state machine, ultimately signaling initialization completion through the `init_end` output."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput Ports:\n- `sys_clk`: System clock input. Explanation: This clock signal is used to drive the state machine and timing counters within the module. It serves as the primary timing reference for state transitions and for the generation of command sequences during the SDRAM initialization process.\n- `sys_rst_n`: System reset input, active low. Explanation: This signal is used to reset the module's internal registers and state machine to their initial states when asserted low. It ensures that the initialization process starts from a known state upon reset or power-up.\n\nOutput Ports:\n- `init_cmd`: Command output, 4-bit. Explanation: This signal carries the SDRAM command currently being issued by the state machine. It changes according to the progression of the SDRAM initialization sequence, following the command requirements for proper SDRAM setup.\n- `init_ba`: Bank address output, 2-bit. Explanation: During the initialization sequence, this signal provides the bank address for certain SDRAM commands where a bank address is needed (such as the precharge command or any commands requiring a specific bank to be selected).\n- `init_addr`: Address output, 13-bit. Explanation: This output carries the address information when issuing certain SDRAM commands, like mode register set or precharge commands. It's set to the relevant address to complete the initialization commands that require address information.\n- `init_end`: Initialization end flag, 1-bit. Explanation: This signal indicates whether the SDRAM initialization process has been completed. A high ('1') signal indicates that the initialization sequence has finished, allowing other modules to proceed with interactions with the SDRAM."

It turns high when the counter `cnt_200us` reaches just below the predetermined time, signaling the module to transition from the initial idle state.\n\n- `trp_end`: This signal is used to indicate the completion of the precharge command period within the initialization sequence. It is asserted when the count of clock cycles matches the TRP (precharge) period, allowing the state machine to progress.\n\n- `trc_end`: This signal indicates the end of the row cycle time (tRC) during auto-refresh periods in the initialization sequence. It transitions high when the number of clock cycles meets the required duration for an auto-refresh command to complete, guiding the next state transition.\n\n- `tmrd_end`: This flag indicates the completion of the mode register set command execution period. It becomes high when the clock cycle count fulfills the TMRD requirement, prompting the state machine to move to the final stage of initialization.\n\n- `cnt_200us`: A counter to measure the initial 200us (microseconds) time delay required for SDRAM power stabilization after power-up. It ensures that subsequent initialization commands are issued only after this stabilization period.\n\n- `init_state`: This register holds the current state of the SDRAM initialization state machine. It guides the flow of initialization commands and timings, transitioning through states from idle to end, based on various internal conditions and signal assertions.\n\n- `cnt_clk`: A clock cycle counter used to measure periods required between different SDRAM command issues in the initialization sequence. It is reset at specific points according to the state machine's needs to time the command sequences correctly.\n\n- `cnt_clk_rst`: A signal that dictates when to reset the `cnt_clk` counter. It is derived from the state machine's current state and other conditions to ensure proper timing intervals between SDRAM commands.\n\n- `cnt_init_aref`: A counter to keep track of the number of auto-refresh commands issued during the initialization. Since multiple auto-refresh cycles are required for proper SDRAM initialization, this counter ensures the correct number is executed before proceeding to mode register setting."

It turns high when the counter `cnt_200us` reaches just below the predetermined time, signaling the module to transition from the initial idle state.\n\n- `trp_end`: This signal is used to indicate the completion of the precharge command period within the initialization sequence. It is asserted when the count of clock cycles matches the TRP (precharge) period, allowing the state machine to progress.\n\n- `trc_end`: This signal indicates the end of the row cycle time (tRC) during auto-refresh periods in the initialization sequence. It transitions high when the number of clock cycles meets the required duration for an auto-refresh command to complete, guiding the next state transition.\n\n- `tmrd_end`: This flag indicates the completion of the mode register set command execution period. It becomes high when the clock cycle count fulfills the TMRD requirement, prompting the state machine to move to the final stage of initialization.\n\n- `cnt_200us`: A counter to measure the initial 200us (microseconds) time delay required for SDRAM power stabilization after power-up. It ensures that subsequent initialization commands are issued only after this stabilization period.\n\n- `init_state`: This register holds the current state of the SDRAM initialization state machine. It guides the flow of initialization commands and timings, transitioning through states from idle to end, based on various internal conditions and signal assertions.\n\n- `cnt_clk`: A clock cycle counter used to measure periods required between different SDRAM command issues in the initialization sequence. It is reset at specific points according to the state machine's needs to time the command sequences correctly.\n\n- `cnt_clk_rst`: A signal that dictates when to reset the `cnt_clk` counter. It is derived from the state machine's current state and other conditions to ensure proper timing intervals between SDRAM commands.\n\n- `cnt_init_aref`: A counter to keep track of the number of auto-refresh commands issued during the initialization. Since multiple auto-refresh cycles are required for proper SDRAM initialization, this counter ensures the correct number is executed before proceeding to mode register setting."

This critical sequence is driven by a clock signal `sys_clk` and an active low reset `sys_rst_n`, which manipulate an internal state machine that progresses through states to output commands at precise timings. The output ports include a 4-bit command signal `init_cmd`, a 2-bit bank address `init_ba`, and a 13-bit address `init_addr` that cater to the requirements of the SDRAM control interface. A completion flag `init_end` indicates the end of the initialization process. Internal signals like `wait_end`, `trp_end`, `trc_end`, `tmrd_end`, among others, act as indicators and counters to manage the timing constraints such as precharge and auto-refresh periods mandated by SDRAM specifications. The code utilizes parameterized states and counters to ensure each step in the initialization sequence adheres to the required clock cycles, while consistently monitoring and resetting the necessary counters based on the current state. Commands are set according to the operational phase, where during waiting periods NOP commands are issued, while initialization relevant commands like precharge, auto-refresh, and mode register set are sequentially invoked as the state machine transits from the IDLE state towards the END state, effectively preparing the SDRAM for normal operation."
