It manages the state and data flow between input/output FIFOs and SDRAM, handling initialization, address management, and request signaling for both read and write processes. On initialization or reset, it clears the SDRAM read/write requests and addresses. It then adjusts the SDRAM write/read addresses based on write/read acknowledge signals and burst lengths, ensuring data is written to or read from correct SDRAM locations. The module also controls when to send read or write requests to SDRAM depending on the availability of data in write FIFO, the requirement from the read FIFO, and an initialization flag, all synchronized to the system clock and reset mechanisms."
