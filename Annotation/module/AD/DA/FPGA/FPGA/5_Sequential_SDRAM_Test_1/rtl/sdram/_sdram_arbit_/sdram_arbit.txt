Module-level comment: The `sdram_arbit` module is a state machine designed for SDRAM operation arbitration, handling initialization, auto-refresh, write, and read requests. It employs input and output ports for command handling and data transactions, with internal state and command registers to manage flow and actions based on the system state. Transitions between states occur in response to operational requests and completion signals, orchestrating precise SDRAM command sequences and control signal adjustments.
