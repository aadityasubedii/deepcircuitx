It manages operations such as initialization, arbitration, automatic refreshing, data writing, and data reading. The module uses sub-modules to handle each aspect of SDRAM control:\n\n- `sdram_init` is responsible for the initialization sequence of the SDRAM.\n- `sdram_arbit` performs arbitration among different commands, such as initialization, auto-refresh, write, and read, ensuring correct timing and prioritization of operations.\n- `sdram_a_ref` handles the auto-refresh mechanism required by SDRAM to maintain data integrity.\n- `sdram_write` and `sdram_read` are responsible for managing data write and read operations to and from the SDRAM.\n\nThe module handles inputs for read and write requests, burst lengths, addresses, and data for write operations. It generates outputs like acknowledgment signals for read and write operations, initialization completion (`init_end`), and the processed data read from the SDRAM. It also generates control and address signals for the SDRAM interface itself, such as chip enable (`sdram_cke`), command signals (`sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`), bank address (`sdram_ba`), address pins (`sdram_addr`), and data bus (`sdram_dq`), with proper timing and sequencing required per the SDRAM specifications."
