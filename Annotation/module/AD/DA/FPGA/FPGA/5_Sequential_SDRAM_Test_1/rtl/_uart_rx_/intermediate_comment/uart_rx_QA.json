It synchronizes to a system clock (`sys_clk`) and a reset signal (`sys_rst_n`), receives serial data from the `rx` input, and processes this data to output it as an 8-bit parallel data (`po_data`) once a complete byte has been received. It signals the availability of the received data using `po_flag`. The module utilizes internal registers and counters to manage the reception and assembly of the serial data based on UART framing format, which typically includes start, data, and stop bits."

It is used to trigger the edge-sensitive logic that handles the serial data processing.\n- `sys_rst_n`: This is an active low synchronous reset input that initializes the internal state of the UART receiver module on a reset condition, ensuring that the module starts operation in a known state.\n- `rx`: This is the serial data input received from an external transmitter. The module listens to this line for incoming serial data following the UART protocol.\n\nOutput ports: `po_data`, `po_flag`.\nExplanation: \n- `po_data`: This is an 8-bit parallel output that contains the data byte received once it is fully assembled from the serial stream.\n- `po_flag`: This output signal is raised high for one clock cycle when a new data byte is available on the `po_data` output. This acts as an indication to external components that the received byte is ready to be read."

By storing the input signal over three clock cycles, these registers help in detecting the falling edge of the start bit in serial communication and in synchronizing the input signal with the system clock.\n\n- `start_nedge`: This signal is used to detect a negative edge, indicating the start of a data reception (the start bit in UART). It becomes high when a falling edge is detected (transition from high to low) between `rx_reg2` and `rx_reg3`.\n\n- `work_en`: This enable signal activates the data reception process. It is set high when a start bit is detected (`start_nedge` is high) and reset when the reception of the byte is completed (after the stop bit).\n\n- `baud_cnt`: This is a baud rate counter that helps in timing the sampling of the bits in the incoming UART signal. The count is synchronized with the system clock and, upon reaching the maximum count set by `BAUD_CNT_MAX`, resets to synchronize with the baud rate of the data transmission.\n\n- `bit_flag`: This flag is set at the midpoint of the expected bit duration to allow for the stable sampling of the data bit. It helps in determining the correct sampling point for each bit.\n\n- `bit_cnt`: This is a bit counter used to count the number of bits that have been received. This counter assists in tracking the reception of individual bits in the frame (start bit, data bits, and stop bit).\n\n- `rx_data`: This register assembles the received bits into a complete 8-bit data byte. It is constructed by shifting in the sampled bits from the `rx` input signal at the appropriate times indicated by `bit_flag`.\n\n- `rx_flag`: This signal is used to indicate that a full byte has been received and assembled in `rx_data`. This flag is raised for one clock cycle when the reception of the byte is complete.\n\nThe internal signals collaborate to manage the reception and synchronization of the incoming serial data according to the UART protocol, ultimately converting it into parallel data available at the output of the module."
