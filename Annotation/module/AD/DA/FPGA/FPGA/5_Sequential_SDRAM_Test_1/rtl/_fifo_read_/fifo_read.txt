Module-level comment: The fifo_read module manages FIFO read operations, outputting data as per baud rate and burst size. It employs internal counters to track read cycles and data bits, and interfaces with a FIFO instance for data transfer. Signals like read_en, read_en_dly, baud_cnt, and rd_en dictate read timing, with flags indicating read status. The module ensures synchronized data extraction from FIFO within system timing constraints.
