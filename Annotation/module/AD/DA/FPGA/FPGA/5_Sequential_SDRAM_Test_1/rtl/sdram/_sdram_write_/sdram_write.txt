Module-level comment: The `sdram_write` module controls SDRAM write operations via a state machine, which sequences through activation, writing, and precharge stages. It synchronizes with the `sys_clk`, responding to write requests (`wr_en`) and utilizes internal counters and flags to uphold SDRAM timing constraints, issue commands (`write_cmd`), and manage output signals (`wr_ack`, `wr_end`, `wr_sdram_en`, `wr_sdram_data`).
