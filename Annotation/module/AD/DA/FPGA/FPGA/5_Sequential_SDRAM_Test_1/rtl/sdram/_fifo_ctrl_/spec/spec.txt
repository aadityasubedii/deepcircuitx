Module name: fifo_ctrl.

Module specification: The fifo_ctrl module serves as a controller designed to manage the interaction between FIFO buffers and SDRAM for both read and write operations, synchronized to a system clock. This module contains input ports for system and operation-specific clocks (`sys_clk`, `wr_fifo_wr_clk`, `rd_fifo_rd_clk`), reset signals (`sys_rst_n`, `wr_rst`, `rd_rst`), data handling (`wr_fifo_wr_data`, `sdram_data_out`), control signals (`wr_fifo_wr_req`, `rd_fifo_rd_req`, `read_valid`, `init_end`), and SDRAM control (`sdram_wr_b_addr`, `sdram_wr_e_addr`, `wr_burst_len`, `sdram_rd_b_addr`, `sdram_rd_e_addr`, `rd_burst_len`, `sdram_wr_ack`, `sdram_rd_ack`). The output ports include SDRAM request and address signaling (`sdram_wr_req`, `sdram_wr_addr`, `sdram_rd_req`, `sdram_rd_addr`), data transfer (`sdram_data_in`, `rd_fifo_rd_data`), and FIFO status (`rd_fifo_num`). Internally, the module utilizes signals (`wr_ack_fall`, `rd_ack_fall`, `wr_fifo_num`, `wr_ack_dly`, `rd_ack_dly`) to monitor and manage the state transitions triggered by changes in the SDRAM acknowledgement signals and to manage FIFO data counts. The code structure encompasses edge detection logic for SDRAM control signals, control state management for reading and writing addressing based on FIFO and SDRAM responses, and integrated submodules (`fifo_data` instances) for FIFO buffer management, indicating clear separation in handling different tasks like FIFO data buffering, address calculation, and request initiation based on operational logic grouped in always blocks which react to system clock and reset conditions for stable, synchronized operation with the given peripherals.
