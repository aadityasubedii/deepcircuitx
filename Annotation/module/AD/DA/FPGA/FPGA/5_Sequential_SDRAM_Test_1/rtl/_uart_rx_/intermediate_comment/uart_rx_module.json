    "module": "Module-level comment: The `uart_rx` module is a UART receiver synchronizing with a system clock to receive serial data and output it as 8-bit parallel data. It utilizes edge detection, baud rate counters, and state machines in multiple always blocks to manage serial data reception, bit counting, and data assembly process, outputting the assembled byte and an availability signal upon completion."
