It handles input and output operations through a set of FIFO controls and manages the SDRAM control signals. This is achieved by interfacing with the 'fifo_ctrl' module, which manages data flow to and from FIFO queues, and the 'sdram_ctrl' module, which directly interfaces with the SDRAM chip to execute memory operations like read, write, and initialization based on the request and acknowledgment signaling. These operations are clocked and synchronized using system clocks and reset signals."
