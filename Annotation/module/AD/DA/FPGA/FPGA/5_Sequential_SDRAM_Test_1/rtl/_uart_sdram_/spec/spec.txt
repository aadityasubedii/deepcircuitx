Module name: uart_sdram. 
Module specification: The "uart_sdram" module is designed to interface between a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) and SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory), facilitating data transfers between the two. It manages clock generation, data reception, buffering, and writing to or reading from SDRAM. Input ports include `sys_clk` (system clock), `sys_rst_n` (active-low system reset), and `clk_Key_1` (special clock input for internal counters). The module outputs several signals to control and interface with SDRAM (`sdram_clk`, `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, etc.), as well as `segs` for a seven-segment display and `sys_clk_dup`, a duplicated system clock. Internal signals, such as `address` for addressing ROM or SDRAM, `rx_data` for received data, `rfifo_wr_data` for data to be written to or read from SDRAM, alongside counters and flags (`rx_flag`, `data_num`, `cnt_wait`), facilitate the moduleâ€™s operation. The code comprises blocks for clock generation (`clk_gen` instance), interfacing with SDRAM (`sdram_top` instance), receiving data from ROM (`rom_inst`), and data/event counting (`counter` instances). Additionally, a `seven_segment_LED` instance drives user feedback via display. Together, these components enable coherent data communication between UART and SDRAM, including data buffering, read/write operations, and user interaction through a display, all while ensuring system synchronization and control.
