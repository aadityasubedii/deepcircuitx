    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_a_ref` module manages SDRAM auto-refresh cycles post-initialization. It sequences precharge and refresh commands based on defined timing parameters, using a state machine and counter-based logic. Input/output ports control and monitor the refresh requests and status, while internal signals and counters govern state transitions and command issue timing."
