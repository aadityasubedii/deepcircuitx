Module name: seven_segment_LED.
Module specification: The `seven_segment_LED` module is designed to interface with a seven-segment LED display by taking a 20-bit binary input (`num`) and converting it into a 42-bit output signal (`segs`) that encodes each of the up to six digits of the input number for display on the LED segments. The input ports are `rst_n`, an active-low synchronous reset that initializes `segs` to zero; `clk`, a clock input that synchronizes updates to the `segs` output; and `num`, the 20-bit binary number to be displayed. The sole output port is `segs`, a 42-bit signal where each 7-bit group represents the encoding for an individual digit on the seven-segment display. Internally, there is a signal `lnum`, which is a 19-bit register that temporarily holds the value of `num` during processing.

The module features an always block that triggers on either the rising edge of `clk` or the falling edge of `rst_n`. If `rst_n` is asserted low, `segs` is reset. If not, the module computes the segment values using a parameter array `ctable` that holds predefined encodings for decimal digits to seven-segment display. The `lnum` register, acting as a stability buffer, is utilized to avoid propagation delays altering the ongoing computation. The calculation is done digit by digit, breaking down `lnum` through division and modulo operations, and matching them to their respective seven-segment encodings from `ctable`. This operation updates `segs` with the correct representation of `num` for the seven-segment LED display.
