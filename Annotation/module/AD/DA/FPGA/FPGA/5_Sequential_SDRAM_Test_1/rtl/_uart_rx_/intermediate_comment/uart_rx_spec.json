    "spec": "Module name: `uart_rx`.\nModule specification: The `uart_rx` module is a UART receiver designed to synchronize with a system clock and reset signal, receiving serial data using specified parameters such as UART_BPS (bits per second) and CLK_FREQ (system clock frequency). It provides an 8-bit parallel data output and a flag to indicate data availability. Among the input ports: `sys_clk` is the system clock, `sys_rst_n` is an active-low synchronous reset, and `rx` is the incoming serial data stream. The outputs are: `po_data`, an 8-bit parallel data output of the received byte, and `po_flag`, a signal indicating that new data is available. Internal signals like `rx_reg1`, `rx_reg2`, and `rx_reg3` are flip-flops for edge detection and synchronization; `start_nedge` detects the UART start bit; `work_en` enables the data reception process; `baud_cnt` is a baud rate counter for timing bit sampling; `bit_flag` indicates the sampling point for bits; `bit_cnt` counts the bits received; `rx_data` assembles the 8-bit data byte; and `rx_flag` indicates the completion of data byte reception.\n\nThe code blocks are structured as follows: initialization and reset of internal registers and flags; edge detection for the start bit; enable logic for activating the reception process; baud rate counter increments and resets based on the system clock and reception status; sampling point flag generation; incoming bit count tracking; data byte assembly from the sampled bits, and flag signalling when data byte reception is complete; output byte updating with the received data; and data availability flagging for external components. Each always block manages a specific aspect of the reception process to decode the asynchronous serial data input and provide it in parallel form.",

It synchronizes to a system clock (`sys_clk`) and a reset signal (`sys_rst_n`), receives serial data from the `rx` input, and processes this data to output it as an 8-bit parallel data (`po_data`) once a complete byte has been received.

The module listens to this line for incoming serial data following the UART protocol.\n\nOutput ports: `po_data`, `po_flag`.\nExplanation: \n- `po_data`: This is an 8-bit parallel output that contains the data byte received once it is fully assembled from the serial stream.\n- `po_flag`: This output signal is raised high for one clock cycle when a new data byte is available on the `po_data` output.

By storing the input signal over three clock cycles, these registers help in detecting the falling edge of the start bit in serial communication and in synchronizing the input signal with the system clock.\n\n- `start_nedge`: This signal is used to detect a negative edge, indicating the start of a data reception (the start bit in UART). It becomes high when a falling edge is detected (transition from high to low) between `rx_reg2` and `rx_reg3`.\n\n- `work_en`: This enable signal activates the data reception process. It is set high when a start bit is detected (`start_nedge` is high) and reset when the reception of the byte is completed (after the stop bit).\n\n- `baud_cnt`: This is a baud rate counter that helps in timing the sampling of the bits in the incoming UART signal. The count is synchronized with the system clock and, upon reaching the maximum count set by `BAUD_CNT_MAX`, resets to synchronize with the baud rate of the data transmission.\n\n- `bit_flag`: This flag is set at the midpoint of the expected bit duration to allow for the stable sampling of the data bit. It helps in determining the correct sampling point for each bit.\n\n- `bit_cnt`: This is a bit counter used to count the number of bits that have been received. This counter assists in tracking the reception of individual bits in the frame (start bit, data bits, and stop bit).\n\n- `rx_data`: This register assembles the received bits into a complete 8-bit data byte. It is constructed by shifting in the sampled bits from the `rx` input signal at the appropriate times indicated by `bit_flag`.\n\n- `rx_flag`: This signal is used to indicate that a full byte has been received and assembled in `rx_data`. This flag is raised for one clock cycle when the reception of the byte is complete.\n\nThe internal signals collaborate to manage the reception and synchronization of the incoming serial data according to the UART protocol, ultimately converting it into parallel data available at the output of the module."

                    "text": "Module name: `uart_rx`.\nModule specification: The `uart_rx` module is a UART receiver designed to synchronize with a system clock and reset signal, receiving serial data using specified parameters such as UART_BPS (bits per second) and CLK_FREQ (system clock frequency). It provides an 8-bit parallel data output and a flag to indicate data availability. Among the input ports: `sys_clk` is the system clock, `sys_rst_n` is an active-low synchronous reset, and `rx` is the incoming serial data stream. The outputs are: `po_data`, an 8-bit parallel data output of the received byte, and `po_flag`, a signal indicating that new data is available. Internal signals like `rx_reg1`, `rx_reg2`, and `rx_reg3` are flip-flops for edge detection and synchronization; `start_nedge` detects the UART start bit; `work_en` enables the data reception process; `baud_cnt` is a baud rate counter for timing bit sampling; `bit_flag` indicates the sampling point for bits; `bit_cnt` counts the bits received; `rx_data` assembles the 8-bit data byte; and `rx_flag` indicates the completion of data byte reception.\n\nThe code blocks are structured as follows: initialization and reset of internal registers and flags; edge detection for the start bit; enable logic for activating the reception process; baud rate counter increments and resets based on the system clock and reception status; sampling point flag generation; incoming bit count tracking; data byte assembly from the sampled bits, and flag signalling when data byte reception is complete; output byte updating with the received data; and data availability flagging for external components. Each always block manages a specific aspect of the reception process to decode the asynchronous serial data input and provide it in parallel form."
