    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_init` module manages the initialization sequence for SDRAM. Driven by `sys_clk` and `sys_rst_n`, it uses a state machine to issue SDRAM setup commands at precise timings. The states and clocks control command generation (`init_cmd`, `init_ba`, `init_addr`) as per SDRAM specs, culminating in an end flag (`init_end`) once initialization is complete. Internal counters and signals ensure each state adheres to required periods before transitioning."
