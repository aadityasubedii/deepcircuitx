    "spec": "Module name: fifo_read.\n\nModule specification: The fifo_read module is responsible for managing the read operations from a FIFO memory buffer, ensuring the handling of data transfers based on the baud rate and burst size. The input ports include `sys_clk` (the system clock that sequences the module\u2019s operation), `sys_rst_n` (the active-low system reset), `rd_fifo_num` (indicating the quantity of data ready for reading), `pi_data` (the incoming data to be stored into the FIFO), and `burst_num` (defining the batch size for read operations). The output ports consist of `read_en` (the read-enable signal), `tx_data` (which holds the data read from the FIFO), and `tx_flag` (signaling the data transfer status). Internal signals are utilized to control the reading process, including `data_num` (tracking in-FIFO data), `read_en_dly` (delayed read enable signal), `baud_cnt` (baud rate timing counter), `rd_en` (FIFO read enable), `rd_flag` (read operation indication), `cnt_read` (read data tracker), `bit_cnt` (bit read counter), and `bit_flag` (mid-baud-period indicator).\n\nThe module\u2019s operation is divided into several processes: 1) Read control enabled by matching `rd_fifo_num` with `burst_num` and disabled when `data_num` equals `burst_num`. 2) Synchronization is achieved using the delayed `read_en_dly`. 3) Read flags and counters are managed to monitor read status and counts. 4) `rd_en` is asserted at precise intervals dictated by the baud rate for bit reading. 5) `tx_flag` is set in conjunction with `rd_en` to indicate data transfer. Finally, the `read_fifo_inst` component interconnects with FIFO, handling the storage (`pi_data`) and retrieval of read data (`tx_data`) controlled by `read_en_dly` and `rd_en`, respectively, while providing feedback on FIFO usage (`data_num`). This systematic approach ensures FIFO data is efficiently and accurately processed in accordance with system operation parameters.",

The input ports include `sys_clk` (the system clock that sequences the module\u2019s operation), `sys_rst_n` (the active-low system reset), `rd_fifo_num` (indicating the quantity of data ready for reading), `pi_data` (the incoming data to be stored into the FIFO), and `burst_num` (defining the batch size for read operations). The output ports consist of `read_en` (the read-enable signal), `tx_data` (which holds the data read from the FIFO), and `tx_flag` (signaling the data transfer status). Internal signals are utilized to control the reading process, including `data_num` (tracking in-FIFO data), `read_en_dly` (delayed read enable signal), `baud_cnt` (baud rate timing counter), `rd_en` (FIFO read enable), `rd_flag` (read operation indication), `cnt_read` (read data tracker), `bit_cnt` (bit read counter), and `bit_flag` (mid-baud-period indicator).\n\nThe module\u2019s operation is divided into several processes: 1) Read control enabled by matching `rd_fifo_num` with `burst_num` and disabled when `data_num` equals `burst_num`. 2) Synchronization is achieved using the delayed `read_en_dly`. 3) Read flags and counters are managed to monitor read status and counts. 4) `rd_en` is asserted at precise intervals dictated by the baud rate for bit reading. 5) `tx_flag` is set in conjunction with `rd_en` to indicate data transfer. Finally, the `read_fifo_inst` component interconnects with FIFO, handling the storage (`pi_data`) and retrieval of read data (`tx_data`) controlled by `read_en_dly` and `rd_en`, respectively, while providing feedback on FIFO usage (`data_num`). This systematic approach ensures FIFO data is efficiently and accurately processed in accordance with system operation parameters."
