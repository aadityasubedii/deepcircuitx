It includes input signals for requests and command details, and manages the output control signals and data paths accordingly based on its current state. The states include IDLE, ARBIT (arbitration phase), AREF (auto-refresh), WRITE, and READ. Transition between states is dictated by the incoming requests and the status of ongoing operations (signaled by end flags). It appropriately sets enable signals and SDRAM command signals based on the current state, ensuring correct timing and command sequencing for the SDRAM operations."
