    "module": "Module-level comment: The `uart_tx` module serializes 8-bit data for UART transmission, employing a system clock and reset. It handles start, data, and stop bits, using internal counters for baud rate timing and bit sequencing. Operates with enable logic, managing timing and data serialization through stateful control in response to input signals."
