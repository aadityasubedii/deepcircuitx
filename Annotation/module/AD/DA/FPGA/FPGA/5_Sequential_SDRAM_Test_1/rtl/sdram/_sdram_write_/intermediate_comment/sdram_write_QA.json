            "content": "Name of the module and its functionality is as follows: \nModule name: sdram_write.\n\nExplanation: The `sdram_write` module is designed to handle the write operations to an SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory). It operates based on a state machine with multiple states to manage the write timing and protocols as per SDRAM specifications. The module receives an input write request (`wr_en`) with the associated address (`wr_addr`) and data (`wr_data`), along with a burst length (`wr_burst_len`) which specifies how many units of data will be written in a sequence.\n\nThe state machine transitions through states like activating a row (`WR_ACTIVE`), waiting for RAS to CAS delay (`WR_TRCD`), writing data (`WR_WRITE`, `WR_DATA`), precharge (`WR_PRE`), and waiting for precharge period (`WR_TRP`) before completing the write cycle (`WR_END`). Control signals like `write_cmd`, `write_ba`, `write_addr`, and `wr_sdram_data` are set accordingly depending on the current state to interact with the SDRAM, following the correct sequence of commands (such as NOP, ACTIVE, WRITE, B_STOP, P_CHARGE). The module generates acknowledgements (`wr_ack`) to the user logic when it is ready to accept data and indicates the end of the write transaction (`wr_end`).\n\nCounters and flags like `cnt_clk`, `trcd_end`, `twrite_end` and `trp_end` assist in tracking the progress of the write cycle and the timing requirements. The operation is dependent on the SDRAM being initialized, which is signalled by the `init_end` input. The state machine resets to the `WR_IDLE` state on a system reset (`sys_rst_n`). The `wr_sdram_en` signal is used to gate write data to the SDRAM, ensuring it is only active during a valid write operation. The design is synchronous to a `sys_clk`."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports:\n- `sys_clk`: System clock signal. Explanation: This is the main clock input that drives the timing of the entire `sdram_write` module, synchronizing operations such as state transitions and data writing to the SDRAM.\n- `sys_rst_n`: System reset signal (active low). Explanation: This signal is used to reset the state machine and other internal registers of the `sdram_write` module to their initial states, ensuring the module starts its operation correctly upon reset.\n- `init_end`: Initialization end flag. Explanation: Indicates whether the SDRAM initialization process has completed, allowing the write operation to start. The write operation can only proceed when this flag is high (`1`).\n- `wr_en`: Write enable signal. Explanation: When set high (`1`), this signal enables the write operation, allowing the `sdram_write` module to initiate a new write cycle to the SDRAM, provided the initialization is complete (`init_end` is high).\n- `wr_addr`: Write address. Explanation: A 24-bit address specifying the location in the SDRAM where the write operation should start.\n- `wr_data`: Write data. Explanation: A 16-bit data value to be written into the SDRAM at the location specified by `wr_addr`.\n- `wr_burst_len`: Write burst length. Explanation: A 10-bit value determining the number of data units (each 16 bits wide) to be written in sequence starting from `wr_addr`.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `wr_ack`: Write acknowledge signal. Explanation: This signal indicates that the `sdram_write` module is ready to accept data for writing to the SDRAM. It is primarily active when the module is in the write state or processing the write data in bursts.\n- `wr_end`: Write end flag. Explanation: Signals the completion of the current write operation, marking the end of the write cycle and indicating that no further data is being written to the SDRAM.\n- `write_cmd`: Write command. Explanation: A 4-bit output that specifies the command to be sent to the SDRAM based on the current state of the state machine, such as NOP, ACTIVE, WRITE, B_STOP, and P_CHARGE.\n- `write_ba`: Write bank address.

Explanation: A 13-bit portion of the SDRAM address (derived from `wr_addr`) specifying the row or column address in the SDRAM for active, write, and precharge operations depending on the state of the module.\n- `wr_sdram_en`: Write SDRAM enable signal. Explanation: Controls the enabling of the SDRAM write data path. It is active high only when `wr_ack` is high, allowing data (`wr_data`) to be written to the SDRAM.\n- `wr_sdram_data`: Write SDRAM data.
