    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"uart_sdram\" module serves as an interface between UART and SDRAM, handling data communication and memory control. It employs clock generation (clk_gen), UART data reception (rom Instance), FIFO buffering (sdram_top), and seven-segment display output (seven_segment_LED) for status indication. The module uses internal registers and counters to manage data flow, synchronization, and system resets ensuring efficient data read/write operations to SDRAM in a synchronized manner."
