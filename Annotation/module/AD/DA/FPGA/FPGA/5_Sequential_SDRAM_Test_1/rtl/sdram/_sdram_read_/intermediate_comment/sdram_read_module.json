    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_read` module controls reading data from SDRAM, managing the sequence and timing of events necessary for read operations. It uses a state machine, driven by `sys_clk`, to progress through states from initialization to data retrieval based on inputs like `rd_en` and `rd_addr`. The module handles the SDRAM commands through outputs `read_cmd`, `read_ba`, and `read_addr`, ensuring appropriate timing through internal counters and signals, and outputs the fetched data through `rd_sdram_data` upon completion of the read."
