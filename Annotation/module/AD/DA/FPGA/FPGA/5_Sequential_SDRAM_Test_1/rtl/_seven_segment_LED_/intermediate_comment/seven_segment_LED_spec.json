    "spec": "Module name: seven_segment_LED.\nModule specification: The `seven_segment_LED` module is designed to interface with a seven-segment LED display by taking a 20-bit binary input (`num`) and converting it into a 42-bit output signal (`segs`) that encodes each of the up to six digits of the input number for display on the LED segments. The input ports are `rst_n`, an active-low synchronous reset that initializes `segs` to zero; `clk`, a clock input that synchronizes updates to the `segs` output; and `num`, the 20-bit binary number to be displayed. The sole output port is `segs`, a 42-bit signal where each 7-bit group represents the encoding for an individual digit on the seven-segment display. Internally, there is a signal `lnum`, which is a 19-bit register that temporarily holds the value of `num` during processing.\n\nThe module features an always block that triggers on either the rising edge of `clk` or the falling edge of `rst_n`. If `rst_n` is asserted low, `segs` is reset. If not, the module computes the segment values using a parameter array `ctable` that holds predefined encodings for decimal digits to seven-segment display. The `lnum` register, acting as a stability buffer, is utilized to avoid propagation delays altering the ongoing computation. The calculation is done digit by digit, breaking down `lnum` through division and modulo operations, and matching them to their respective seven-segment encodings from `ctable`. This operation updates `segs` with the correct representation of `num` for the seven-segment LED display.",

It processes the input number digit by digit, converts each digit into its corresponding seven-segment encoding as defined in the `ctable` parameter, and triggers an update on the positive edge of `clk` or the negative edge of `rst_n`. If `rst_n` is deasserted, it resets the output `segs` to zero. Otherwise, it updates the `segs` with the seven-segment encoded digits, where each 7-bit segment of `segs` corresponds to a single digit of the input number, allowing up to six digits to be displayed."

When `rst_n` is driven low, it synchronously initializes the `segs` output register to zero, essentially resetting the seven-segment display.\n- `clk`: This is the clock input. It is used to synchronize updates to the `segs` output register to the moments when the clock transitions from low to high (positive edge).\n- `num`: This is a 20-bit-wide binary input representing the number that is to be displayed on the seven-segment LED display.\n\nOutput ports: `segs`.\nExplanation: \n- `segs`: This is a 42-bit-wide output register that holds the encoding for the seven-segment LED display. Each group of 7 bits corresponds to one digit of the input `num`, encoding how each of the seven segments is to be illuminated to represent the digit. The least significant 7 bits correspond to the least significant digit of the input number, and so on up to the most significant 6th digit (from right to left when viewing a display)."

When the always block is triggered by either the positive edge of `clk` or the negative edge of `rst_n`, the value of `num` is copied to `lnum`. The purpose of using `lnum` is to stabilize the input `num` during the calculation of segment values, protecting the operation from potential changes in `num` during signal propagation across the sequential logic steps. This ensures that the computation for segment encoding and output remain consistent for the duration of a cycle."
