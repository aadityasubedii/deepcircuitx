    "spec": "Module name: sdram_arbit. \n\nModule specification: The `sdram_arbit` module is a state machine designed to arbitrate among initialization, auto-refresh, write, and read requests for a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM). The module manages these operations through a range of input and output ports. Input ports such as `sys_clk` and `sys_rst_n` provide the timing signal and reset functionality, respectively. Other inputs like `init_cmd`, `init_end`, `init_ba`, `init_addr`, `aref_req`, `aref_end`, `aref_cmd`, `aref_ba`, `aref_addr`, `wr_req`, `wr_end`, `wr_cmd`, `wr_ba`, `wr_addr`, `wr_data`, `wr_sdram_en`, `rd_req`, `rd_end`, `rd_cmd`, `rd_addr`, and `rd_ba` handle initialization, auto-refresh, write, and read requests, as well as indicating the end of these operations. Output ports such as `aref_en`, `wr_en`, `rd_en`, `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`, `sdram_ba`, `sdram_addr`, and the bidirectional `sdram_dq` are responsible for activating SDRAM operations, providing SDRAM control signals, and moving data. Internal signals include `sdram_cmd`, which stores the SDRAM command, and `state`, which retains the current state of the module.\n\nThe code is organized into several sections. First, the parameters such as `IDLE`, `ARBIT`, `AREF`, `WRITE`, and `READ` define various states of the state machine. The first `always` block handles state transitions based on initial conditions and request signals. Subsequent `always` blocks manage the enabling of auto-refresh, write, and read operations. A combinational `always` block is used to update SDRAM signals like command, bank address, and memory address based on the current state. Lastly, continuous assignments are utilized to set constant values and conditional data output for the SDRAM. This structured approach ensures that the module can efficiently manage the operational commands for the SDRAM with the appropriate timing and sequence.",

The module manages these operations through a range of input and output ports. Input ports such as `sys_clk` and `sys_rst_n` provide the timing signal and reset functionality, respectively. Other inputs like `init_cmd`, `init_end`, `init_ba`, `init_addr`, `aref_req`, `aref_end`, `aref_cmd`, `aref_ba`, `aref_addr`, `wr_req`, `wr_end`, `wr_cmd`, `wr_ba`, `wr_addr`, `wr_data`, `wr_sdram_en`, `rd_req`, `rd_end`, `rd_cmd`, `rd_addr`, and `rd_ba` handle initialization, auto-refresh, write, and read requests, as well as indicating the end of these operations. Output ports such as `aref_en`, `wr_en`, `rd_en`, `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`, `sdram_ba`, `sdram_addr`, and the bidirectional `sdram_dq` are responsible for activating SDRAM operations, providing SDRAM control signals, and moving data. Internal signals include `sdram_cmd`, which stores the SDRAM command, and `state`, which retains the current state of the module.\n\nThe code is organized into several sections. First, the parameters such as `IDLE`, `ARBIT`, `AREF`, `WRITE`, and `READ` define various states of the state machine. The first `always` block handles state transitions based on initial conditions and request signals. Subsequent `always` blocks manage the enabling of auto-refresh, write, and read operations. A combinational `always` block is used to update SDRAM signals like command, bank address, and memory address based on the current state. Lastly, continuous assignments are utilized to set constant values and conditional data output for the SDRAM. This structured approach ensures that the module can efficiently manage the operational commands for the SDRAM with the appropriate timing and sequence."
