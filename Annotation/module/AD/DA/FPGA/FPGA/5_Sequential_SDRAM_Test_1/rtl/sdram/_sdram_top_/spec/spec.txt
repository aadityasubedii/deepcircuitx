Module name: sdram_top.

Module specification: The `sdram_top` module serves as the principal interface for SDRAM operations, including data read and write functionalities. It synchronizes with system and external components through input signals like the system clock (`sys_clk`), external clock output (`clk_out`), and an active-low system reset (`sys_rst_n`). Additionally, it manages FIFO operations for read and write processes with associated clock inputs (`wr_fifo_wr_clk`, `rd_fifo_rd_clk`), request signals (`wr_fifo_wr_req`, `rd_fifo_rd_req`), data (`wr_fifo_wr_data`, `rd_fifo_rd_data`), and control parameters such as burst lengths and reset signals (`wr_burst_len`, `rd_burst_len`, `wr_rst`, `rd_rst`). SDRAM control is further facilitated by addresses for writing and reading (`sdram_wr_b_addr`, `sdram_wr_e_addr`, `sdram_rd_b_addr`, `sdram_rd_e_addr`), alongside output signals like FIFO entries count (`rd_fifo_num`), and initialization completion indicator (`init_end`). Control signals for the SDRAM chip (`sdram_clk`, `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`, `sdram_ba`, `sdram_addr`, `sdram_dqm`) and bidirectional data bus (`sdram_dq`) are also provided.

Internally, the module uses signals such as `sdram_wr_req`, `sdram_wr_ack`, `sdram_wr_addr`, `sdram_data_in` for write requests and corresponding acknowledgment, address handling, and data input. Similarly, `sdram_rd_req`, `sdram_rd_ack`, `sdram_rd_addr`, `sdram_data_out` manage read operations with request and acknowledgment signals, read addresses, and output data.

The Verilog code for `sdram_top` is organized into two primary blocks: the FIFO control (`fifo_ctrl`) and the SDRAM control (`sdram_ctrl`) instances. The FIFO control manages data flow to and from FIFO queues and interfaces with the SDRAM controller to initiate memory operations based on requests and acknowledgments. The SDRAM controller directly interacts with the SDRAM chip to execute the necessary read, write, and initialization sequences. These components ensure that the module efficiently manages data transfer and operations on the SDRAM, making it a fundamental part of systems requiring SDRAM interaction.
