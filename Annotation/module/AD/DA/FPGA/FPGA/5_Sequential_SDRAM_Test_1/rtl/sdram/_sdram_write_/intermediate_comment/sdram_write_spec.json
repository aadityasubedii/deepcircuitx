    "spec": "Module name: sdram_write. \n\nModule specification: The `sdram_write` module is tailored for managing write operations to an SDRAM. It incorporates a finite state machine that orchestrates the write sequence according to SDRAM protocol requirements, utilizing a system clock (`sys_clk`) for synchronization. On receiving a write enable signal (`wr_en`), along with the target memory address (`wr_addr`), data (`wr_data`), and burst length (`wr_burst_len`), the module commences the write procedure, provided the SDRAM initialization (`init_end`) has concluded. Output indications are given through the write acknowledge (`wr_ack`) and write end (`wr_end`) signals, while the `write_cmd`, `write_ba`, `write_addr`, `wr_sdram_en`, and `wr_sdram_data` outputs command and route data to the SDRAM. Internally, the `write_state` maintains the execution state, while counters (`cnt_clk`) and control flags such as `trcd_end`, `twrite_end`, and `trp_end` ensure timing compliance. The code is segmented into initialization blocks, state transitions, command generation, and output assignments. Each block serves a specific function, from resetting internal variables on system reset, navigating through the operational states, issuing corresponding SDRAM commands, to gating and outputting the correct data to the SDRAM interface. The module efficiently handles the details of write timing, protocol adherence, and signaling, making it an integral part of an SDRAM interfacing system.",

            "content": "Name of the module and its functionality is as follows: \nModule name: sdram_write.\n\nExplanation: The `sdram_write` module is designed to handle the write operations to an SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory). It operates based on a state machine with multiple states to manage the write timing and protocols as per SDRAM specifications. The module receives an input write request (`wr_en`) with the associated address (`wr_addr`) and data (`wr_data`), along with a burst length (`wr_burst_len`) which specifies how many units of data will be written in a sequence.\n\nThe state machine transitions through states like activating a row (`WR_ACTIVE`), waiting for RAS to CAS delay (`WR_TRCD`), writing data (`WR_WRITE`, `WR_DATA`), precharge (`WR_PRE`), and waiting for precharge period (`WR_TRP`) before completing the write cycle (`WR_END`). Control signals like `write_cmd`, `write_ba`, `write_addr`, and `wr_sdram_data` are set accordingly depending on the current state to interact with the SDRAM, following the correct sequence of commands (such as NOP, ACTIVE, WRITE, B_STOP, P_CHARGE). The module generates acknowledgements (`wr_ack`) to the user logic when it is ready to accept data and indicates the end of the write transaction (`wr_end`).\n\nCounters and flags like `cnt_clk`, `trcd_end`, `twrite_end` and `trp_end` assist in tracking the progress of the write cycle and the timing requirements. The operation is dependent on the SDRAM being initialized, which is signalled by the `init_end` input. The state machine resets to the `WR_IDLE` state on a system reset (`sys_rst_n`). The `wr_sdram_en` signal is used to gate write data to the SDRAM, ensuring it is only active during a valid write operation. The design is synchronous to a `sys_clk`."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports:\n- `sys_clk`: System clock signal. Explanation: This is the main clock input that drives the timing of the entire `sdram_write` module, synchronizing operations such as state transitions and data writing to the SDRAM.\n- `sys_rst_n`: System reset signal (active low). Explanation: This signal is used to reset the state machine and other internal registers of the `sdram_write` module to their initial states, ensuring the module starts its operation correctly upon reset.\n- `init_end`: Initialization end flag. Explanation: Indicates whether the SDRAM initialization process has completed, allowing the write operation to start. The write operation can only proceed when this flag is high (`1`).\n- `wr_en`: Write enable signal. Explanation: When set high (`1`), this signal enables the write operation, allowing the `sdram_write` module to initiate a new write cycle to the SDRAM, provided the initialization is complete (`init_end` is high).\n- `wr_addr`: Write address. Explanation: A 24-bit address specifying the location in the SDRAM where the write operation should start.\n- `wr_data`: Write data. Explanation: A 16-bit data value to be written into the SDRAM at the location specified by `wr_addr`.\n- `wr_burst_len`: Write burst length. Explanation: A 10-bit value determining the number of data units (each 16 bits wide) to be written in sequence starting from `wr_addr`.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `wr_ack`: Write acknowledge signal. Explanation: This signal indicates that the `sdram_write` module is ready to accept data for writing to the SDRAM. It is primarily active when the module is in the write state or processing the write data in bursts.\n- `wr_end`: Write end flag. Explanation: Signals the completion of the current write operation, marking the end of the write cycle and indicating that no further data is being written to the SDRAM.\n- `write_cmd`: Write command. Explanation: A 4-bit output that specifies the command to be sent to the SDRAM based on the current state of the state machine, such as NOP, ACTIVE, WRITE, B_STOP, and P_CHARGE.\n- `write_ba`: Write bank address. Explanation: A 2-bit bank address part of the SDRAM address, derived from the `wr_addr`, used during activation, writing, and precharging phases to specify the bank in the SDRAM where operations are to take place.\n- `write_addr`: Write address. Explanation: A 13-bit portion of the SDRAM address (derived from `wr_addr`) specifying the row or column address in the SDRAM for active, write, and precharge operations depending on the state of the module.\n- `wr_sdram_en`: Write SDRAM enable signal. Explanation: Controls the enabling of the SDRAM write data path. It is active high only when `wr_ack` is high, allowing data (`wr_data`) to be written to the SDRAM.\n- `wr_sdram_data`: Write SDRAM data. Explanation: A 16-bit data bus carrying the data to be written into the SDRAM when `wr_sdram_en` is high, directly reflecting `wr_data` input when the write operation is active."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals:\n- `write_state`: Explanation: This register holds the current state of the state machine which guides the SDRAM write operation through its various stages such as idle, active, writing, precharge, and end states.\n- `cnt_clk`: Explanation: Counter used to measure the duration of specific states in the state machine like `WR_TRCD`, `WR_DATA`, and `WR_TRP`. It helps in ensuring that operations adhere to the required SDRAM timing parameters such as RAS to CAS delay, write burst length, and precharge period.\n- `cnt_clk_rst`: Explanation: This signal is used to reset `cnt_clk`. It goes high in specific cases to reset the counter based on the state machine transitions, for example, when moving from one state to another that requires timing control.\n- `trcd_end`: Explanation: A flag that indicates the end of the RAS to CAS delay period (`TRCD_CLK`). When this signal goes high, it signifies that the module can transition from the `WR_TRCD` state to the `WR_WRITE` state.\n- `twrite_end`: Explanation: This signal goes high to indicate that the write burst length (`wr_burst_len`) has been completed. It is used to transition the state machine from the `WR_DATA` state to the `WR_PRE` state signifying the end of data writing phase.\n- `trp_end`: Explanation: A flag that indicates the end of the precharge period (`TRP_CLK`). When high, it guides the state machine to move from the `WR_TRP` state to the `WR_END` state, indicating that the precharge operation is complete and the write cycle can be restarted or concluded.\n\nThese internal signals ensure the proper sequence and timing are met for interacting with SDRAM according to its protocol. They are crucial in controlling state transitions, issuing the right commands to the SDRAM, and managing the flow of data during the write operation."

                    "text": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports:\n- `sys_clk`: System clock signal. Explanation: This is the main clock input that drives the timing of the entire `sdram_write` module, synchronizing operations such as state transitions and data writing to the SDRAM.\n- `sys_rst_n`: System reset signal (active low). Explanation: This signal is used to reset the state machine and other internal registers of the `sdram_write` module to their initial states, ensuring the module starts its operation correctly upon reset.\n- `init_end`: Initialization end flag. Explanation: Indicates whether the SDRAM initialization process has completed, allowing the write operation to start. The write operation can only proceed when this flag is high (`1`).\n- `wr_en`: Write enable signal. Explanation: When set high (`1`), this signal enables the write operation, allowing the `sdram_write` module to initiate a new write cycle to the SDRAM, provided the initialization is complete (`init_end` is high).\n- `wr_addr`: Write address. Explanation: A 24-bit address specifying the location in the SDRAM where the write operation should start.\n- `wr_data`: Write data. Explanation: A 16-bit data value to be written into the SDRAM at the location specified by `wr_addr`.\n- `wr_burst_len`: Write burst length. Explanation: A 10-bit value determining the number of data units (each 16 bits wide) to be written in sequence starting from `wr_addr`.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `wr_ack`: Write acknowledge signal. Explanation: This signal indicates that the `sdram_write` module is ready to accept data for writing to the SDRAM. It is primarily active when the module is in the write state or processing the write data in bursts.\n- `wr_end`: Write end flag. Explanation: Signals the completion of the current write operation, marking the end of the write cycle and indicating that no further data is being written to the SDRAM.\n- `write_cmd`: Write command. Explanation: A 4-bit output that specifies the command to be sent to the SDRAM based on the current state of the state machine, such as NOP, ACTIVE, WRITE, B_STOP, and P_CHARGE.\n- `write_ba`: Write bank address. Explanation: A 2-bit bank address part of the SDRAM address, derived from the `wr_addr`, used during activation, writing, and precharging phases to specify the bank in the SDRAM where operations are to take place.\n- `write_addr`: Write address. Explanation: A 13-bit portion of the SDRAM address (derived from `wr_addr`) specifying the row or column address in the SDRAM for active, write, and precharge operations depending on the state of the module.\n- `wr_sdram_en`: Write SDRAM enable signal. Explanation: Controls the enabling of the SDRAM write data path. It is active high only when `wr_ack` is high, allowing data (`wr_data`) to be written to the SDRAM.\n- `wr_sdram_data`: Write SDRAM data. Explanation: A 16-bit data bus carrying the data to be written into the SDRAM when `wr_sdram_en` is high, directly reflecting `wr_data` input when the write operation is active."

It helps in ensuring that operations adhere to the required SDRAM timing parameters such as RAS to CAS delay, write burst length, and precharge period.\n- `cnt_clk_rst`: Explanation: This signal is used to reset `cnt_clk`. It goes high in specific cases to reset the counter based on the state machine transitions, for example, when moving from one state to another that requires timing control.\n- `trcd_end`: Explanation: A flag that indicates the end of the RAS to CAS delay period (`TRCD_CLK`). When this signal goes high, it signifies that the module can transition from the `WR_TRCD` state to the `WR_WRITE` state.\n- `twrite_end`: Explanation: This signal goes high to indicate that the write burst length (`wr_burst_len`) has been completed. It is used to transition the state machine from the `WR_DATA` state to the `WR_PRE` state signifying the end of data writing phase.\n- `trp_end`: Explanation: A flag that indicates the end of the precharge period (`TRP_CLK`). When high, it guides the state machine to move from the `WR_TRP` state to the `WR_END` state, indicating that the precharge operation is complete and the write cycle can be restarted or concluded.\n\nThese internal signals ensure the proper sequence and timing are met for interacting with SDRAM according to its protocol. They are crucial in controlling state transitions, issuing the right commands to the SDRAM, and managing the flow of data during the write operation."

It incorporates a finite state machine that orchestrates the write sequence according to SDRAM protocol requirements, utilizing a system clock (`sys_clk`) for synchronization. On receiving a write enable signal (`wr_en`), along with the target memory address (`wr_addr`), data (`wr_data`), and burst length (`wr_burst_len`), the module commences the write procedure, provided the SDRAM initialization (`init_end`) has concluded. Output indications are given through the write acknowledge (`wr_ack`) and write end (`wr_end`) signals, while the `write_cmd`, `write_ba`, `write_addr`, `wr_sdram_en`, and `wr_sdram_data` outputs command and route data to the SDRAM. Internally, the `write_state` maintains the execution state, while counters (`cnt_clk`) and control flags such as `trcd_end`, `twrite_end`, and `trp_end` ensure timing compliance. The code is segmented into initialization blocks, state transitions, command generation, and output assignments. Each block serves a specific function, from resetting internal variables on system reset, navigating through the operational states, issuing corresponding SDRAM commands, to gating and outputting the correct data to the SDRAM interface. The module efficiently handles the details of write timing, protocol adherence, and signaling, making it an integral part of an SDRAM interfacing system."
