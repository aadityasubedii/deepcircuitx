Module name: sdram_a_ref.  
Module specification: The `sdram_a_ref` module simulates an SDRAM auto-refresh controller which manages the timing and execution of auto-refresh cycles following system initialization. The module utilizes input ports: `sys_clk` (system clock), `sys_rst_n` (active low system reset), `init_end` (signal indicating end of initialization), and `aref_en` (auto-refresh enable signal). The output ports include `aref_req` (auto-refresh request signal), `aref_cmd` (4-bit command to SDRAM), `aref_ba` (2-bit SDRAM bank address), `aref_addr` (13-bit SDRAM row address), and `aref_end` (signal indicating the end of the auto-refresh sequence). Internal signals such as `trp_end`, `trc_end`, `aref_ack`, `cnt_aref`, `aref_state`, `cnt_clk`, `cnt_clk_rst`, and `cnt_aref_aref` facilitate the control of state transitions, counting clock cycles, and managing the refresh sequence. The code is structured around multiple always blocks and assignments that define the state machine transitioning through idle, precharge, auto-refresh, and end states based on triggers like clock edges and reset conditions. Key operations include counting towards refresh intervals, issuing SDRAM commands, and managing refresh cycles to ensure proper timing and operation sequences for maintaining data integrity in SDRAM modules.
