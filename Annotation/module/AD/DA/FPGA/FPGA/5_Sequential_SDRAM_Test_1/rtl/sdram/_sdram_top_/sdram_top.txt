Module-level comment: The `sdram_top` module serves as a top-level interface for SDRAM operations, handling read and write functionalities with FIFO control. It orchestrates input/output operations, manages memory addressing, and synchronizes signals to perform data transfers effectively. The module comprises `fifo_ctrl` to interface between FIFOs and `sdram_ctrl` for direct SDRAM communication, ensuring seamless data flow and memory management.
