    "spec": "Module name: uart_tx.\nModule specification: The `uart_tx` module in Verilog handles UART transmission functionality, converting 8-bit parallel input data into a serial format for communication over a UART interface. The module uses inputs `sys_clk` (system clock) and `sys_rst_n` (active low reset) for timing and internal state management. Data to be transmitted is provided through the `pi_data` input, while the `pi_flag` input signals when to begin transmission. The single output `tx` carries the serialized data stream. Internally, `BAUD_CNT_MAX` serves as a threshold calculated from system clock frequency (`CLK_FREQ`) and baud rate (`UART_BPS`) for baud rate timing. The `baud_cnt` counter tracks cycles for bit-duration timing; `bit_flag` indicates when to output a bit; `bit_cnt` tracks the bit position in the frame; and `work_en` controls the enable state of transmission operations. The code consists of sequential blocks sensitive to the `sys_clk` or `sys_rst_n`: one block sets `work_en`, another manages `baud_cnt`, a third controls the `bit_flag`, another block manages `bit_cnt`, and the final one drives the output `tx`. This structure allows the module to output a start bit, 8 bits of data in LSB-first order, and a stop bit, following the UART protocol.",

It accepts an 8-bit parallel data input (`pi_data`) and a flag signal (`pi_flag`) indicating when data should be transmitted. The module utilizes the system clock (`sys_clk`) and a reset signal (`sys_rst_n`) to control the timing and reset conditions. The UART communication is managed by converting the parallel data input into a serial format governed by settings like baud rate (`UART_BPS`) and the system clock frequency (`CLK_FREQ`). The module features a sequential process of transmitting each bit, starting with a start bit (logic low), followed by the 8 bits of data in a least significant bit first manner, and ending with a stop bit (logic high).

It is crucial for transitioning the internal states and managing the timing of the UART transmission.\n- sys_rst_n: This is the system reset input (active low). It's used to reset the internal states of the module to their initial conditions upon a reset event.\n- pi_data: This represents the 8-bit parallel input data that the module will transmit over UART. This data is sent serially based on the UART protocol.\n- pi_flag: This is a control signal input indicating when the module should start transmitting data. When this flag is high, the module initiates the transmission process.\n\nOutput ports: tx.\nExplanation:\n- tx: This is the UART transmit data output, which sends out the serial data formed from the input parallel data (pi_data).

It determines the maximum count value for the baud counter (`baud_cnt`) which controls the rate of UART transmission.\n- baud_cnt: This register counts the clock cycles to match the UART transmission speed based on the baud rate. It ensures that each bit (start, data, or stop bit) is held for the correct duration according to the UART protocol.\n- bit_flag: This signal is a flag used to indicate the exact clock cycle when the transmission of a bit should take place. It is set every time the `baud_cnt` reaches a specific count (just after being reset), signaling the start of a new bit transmission.\n- bit_cnt: This 4-bit register counts the bits being transmitted. It tracks the progress from the start bit through the data bits to the stop bit, ensuring the correct sequence and number of bits are transmitted.\n- work_en: This enable signal determines whether the UART transmission is active. It is set high when transmission is initiated (upon `pi_flag` being high) and reset after the complete set of bits (including the stop bit) has been transmitted.
