Module name: uart_tx.
Module specification: The `uart_tx` module in Verilog handles UART transmission functionality, converting 8-bit parallel input data into a serial format for communication over a UART interface. The module uses inputs `sys_clk` (system clock) and `sys_rst_n` (active low reset) for timing and internal state management. Data to be transmitted is provided through the `pi_data` input, while the `pi_flag` input signals when to begin transmission. The single output `tx` carries the serialized data stream. Internally, `BAUD_CNT_MAX` serves as a threshold calculated from system clock frequency (`CLK_FREQ`) and baud rate (`UART_BPS`) for baud rate timing. The `baud_cnt` counter tracks cycles for bit-duration timing; `bit_flag` indicates when to output a bit; `bit_cnt` tracks the bit position in the frame; and `work_en` controls the enable state of transmission operations. The code consists of sequential blocks sensitive to the `sys_clk` or `sys_rst_n`: one block sets `work_en`, another manages `baud_cnt`, a third controls the `bit_flag`, another block manages `bit_cnt`, and the final one drives the output `tx`. This structure allows the module to output a start bit, 8 bits of data in LSB-first order, and a stop bit, following the UART protocol.
