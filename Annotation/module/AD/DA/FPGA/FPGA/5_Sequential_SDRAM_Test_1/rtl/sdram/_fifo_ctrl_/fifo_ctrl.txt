Module-level comment: The fifo_ctrl module interfaces FIFOs with SDRAM for read/write operations, handling data flow and address management synchronized by system clocks. It incorporates input handling, address resetting and updating through ack signals, and FIFO control. Submodules manage FIFO data buffering, dynamically adjusting read/write requests based on FIFO status and SDRAM acknowledgments.
