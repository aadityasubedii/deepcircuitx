Module name: sdram_write. 

Module specification: The `sdram_write` module is tailored for managing write operations to an SDRAM. It incorporates a finite state machine that orchestrates the write sequence according to SDRAM protocol requirements, utilizing a system clock (`sys_clk`) for synchronization. On receiving a write enable signal (`wr_en`), along with the target memory address (`wr_addr`), data (`wr_data`), and burst length (`wr_burst_len`), the module commences the write procedure, provided the SDRAM initialization (`init_end`) has concluded. Output indications are given through the write acknowledge (`wr_ack`) and write end (`wr_end`) signals, while the `write_cmd`, `write_ba`, `write_addr`, `wr_sdram_en`, and `wr_sdram_data` outputs command and route data to the SDRAM. Internally, the `write_state` maintains the execution state, while counters (`cnt_clk`) and control flags such as `trcd_end`, `twrite_end`, and `trp_end` ensure timing compliance. The code is segmented into initialization blocks, state transitions, command generation, and output assignments. Each block serves a specific function, from resetting internal variables on system reset, navigating through the operational states, issuing corresponding SDRAM commands, to gating and outputting the correct data to the SDRAM interface. The module efficiently handles the details of write timing, protocol adherence, and signaling, making it an integral part of an SDRAM interfacing system.
