Module name: pmod_unit_tb. Module specification: The "pmod_unit_tb" serves as a testbench for verifying the operational integrity of a module named "pmod_unit". It primarily handles the emulation of clock and reset signals, and the simulation of initialization sequences for ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) and DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter). Input ports include `clock`, which toggles based on `SYS_CLOCK_PERIOD` to simulate a real clock environment; `reset`, which is initially high to assert reset and then goes low to deassert after a 100 ns delay; `adc_init_done` and `dac_init_done`, which go high after pre-defined periods to simulate completion of their respective initializations. Output ports are `led0_r`, `led0_g`, `led0_b`, `led1_r`, `led1_g`, `led1_b`, conveying the status of two LEDs in RGB format, potentially indicating operational states or outcomes. The internal signals mirror the interface ports and control the core timing and sequence logic. Code blocks include initial setups for signals, clock generation, ADC and DAC initialization control, and instantiation of the "pmod_unit" with mapping of testbench ports to unit ports, reflecting a structured approach to testing and simulation.
