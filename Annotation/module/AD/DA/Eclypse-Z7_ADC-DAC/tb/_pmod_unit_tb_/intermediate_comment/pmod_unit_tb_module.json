    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"pmod_unit_tb\" is a testbench for the \"pmod_unit\" module, ensuring its proper operation by simulating clock and reset signals, and ADC/DAC initialization sequences. It uses registers for input simulation and wires for output status indicators of LEDs in RGB, controlling and observing through repetitive signal toggling and sequential initialization, effectively emulating the module operational environment."
