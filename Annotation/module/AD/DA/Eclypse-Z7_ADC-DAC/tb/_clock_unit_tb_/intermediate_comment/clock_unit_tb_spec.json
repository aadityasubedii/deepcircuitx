    "spec": "Module name: clock_unit_tb. \nModule specification: The `clock_unit_tb` is a testbench designed to verify the `clock_unit` module, which serves as a framework for simulating a clock and reset sequence. The testbench lacks conventional input or output ports since it's used internally, but it generates and manipulates the `clock` and `reset` signals. Internally, `clock` is a toggled signal meant to represent the system clock, while `reset` simulates the reset initialization, being de-asserted after a delay to emulate coming out of the reset state. The testbench observes the outputs `clock0`, `clock1`, `clock2`, and `valid` through corresponding internal wires, which are connected to the `clock_unit` outputs to verify its functionality. The `SYS_CLOCK_PERIOD` parameter determines the clock's period. There are two principal blocks within the code: The first is the `initial` block that initializes the `clock` to a low state and `reset` to a high state before de-asserting `reset` after a specified duration; the second is the `always` block that perpetually toggles the `clock` signal at intervals defined by half the system clock period. Lastly, a instance of `clock_unit` is created with the input signals connected to the test signals `clock` and `reset`, and the output ports connected to internal wires `clock0`, `clock1`, `clock2`, and `valid` for observation and verification during simulation.",
