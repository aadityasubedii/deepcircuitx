It is designed to stimulate and observe the behavior of the `clock_unit` module by driving test vectors (in this case, clock and reset signals) and monitoring the outputs (clock0, clock1, clock2, and valid) internally connected to the DUT.\n\nNote: The `clock_unit_tb` instantiates the `clock_unit` and connects its outputs (clock0, clock1, clock2, and valid) to internal wires for monitoring their states.
