Module-level comment: The `clock_unit_tb` is a testbench module designed for verifying the `clock_unit`. It generates a clock signal toggled every half of `SYS_CLOCK_PERIOD` and initializes a reset signal that is de-asserted after a delay. This test setup drives the inputs of an instantiated `clock_unit` and observes its outputs (`clock0`, `clock1`, `clock2`, `valid`) to ensure proper operation and timing under simulated clock and reset conditions.
