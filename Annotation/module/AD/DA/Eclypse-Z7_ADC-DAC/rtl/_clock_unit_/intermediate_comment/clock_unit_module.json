    "module": "Module-level comment: The `clock_unit` module processes an input clock (`i_clock`) using a clock wizard (`clk_wiz_0`) to generate three different frequency clocks (`o_clock0`, `o_clock1`, `o_clock2`) and a validity signal (`o_valid`). It serves as an interface, connecting inputs directly to the clock wizard and routing its outputs to the module outputs, efficiently encapsulating the clock generation and management logic."
