    "spec": "Module name: clock_unit. Module specification: The `clock_unit` module is a hardware component written in Verilog designed to handle clock generation and management functions within a digital system. It takes a single input clock signal (`i_clock`) and an input reset signal (`i_reset`). After processing these inputs through a clock wizard block (`clk_wiz_0`), it generates three output clock signals at potentially different frequencies and/or phases (`o_clock0`, `o_clock1`, `o_clock2`). Additionally, it provides an output signal (`o_valid`) indicating the stability and validity of the output clock signals, which is particularly useful after a reset operation or during initial power-up.\n\nThe input port `i_clock` is the primary external clock reference for the module, while `i_reset` serves as an external control to reinitialize the clock generation process. The output ports\u2014`o_clock0`, `o_clock1`, and `o_clock2`\u2014are the clocks produced by the clock wizard, each potentially configured with specific frequency and phase characteristics. The `o_valid` output is tied to the `locked` signal from the clock wizard, signaling the readiness of the output clock signals.\n\nThere are no internal signals declared within the `clock_unit` module, as it primarily acts as a wrapper for the `clk_wiz_0` instantiation, which encapsulates the clock management logic. The module is partitioned into the port declaration section, which sets up its interface, and a single block for the clock wizard instantiation, `u_clk_wiz_0`, connecting the inputs directly to the clock wizard and routing the wizard's outputs to the module's outputs correspondingly. There are no additional internal processing blocks or sections, underscoring the module's role as an intermediary between the external signals and the clock wizard component.",
