Module name: dac. 

Module specification: The 'dac' module operates as a digital-to-analog converter interface specifically designed to control a Zmod DAC device, likely an Analog Devices DAC chip, on a Zmod board. It utilizes a system clock (`i_sys_clock`), a DAC clock (`i_dac_clock`), and a DAC input clock (`i_dac_in_clock`) for timing and synchronization purposes, while receiving digital input data (`i_data`) that is validated by an accompanying signal (`i_data_valid`). The module outputs analog data (`o_dac_data`) through its various control and clock outputs such as serial data IO (`io_dac_sdio`), chip select (`o_dac_cs`), serial clock (`o_dac_sclk`), and DAC reset (`o_dac_reset`). Additional outputs include differential clock outputs (`o_dac_clkio_p`, `o_dac_clkin_p`), their complementary signals which are constantly low (`o_dac_clkio_n`, `o_dac_clkin_n`), signals to set the full scale of DAC channels (`o_dac_set_fs_ch1`, `o_dac_set_fs_ch2`), and enable and initialization signals (`o_dac_enable`, `o_dac_init_done`). Internally, the module uses `enable` and `test_mode` registers to manage DAC operations and configuration modes, and interacts with the `ZmodAWGController_0` instance for DAC management which processes control flow signals like `init_error` and `ready`. The code integrates and maps these various functionalities effectively, ensuring that the digital-to-analog conversion and overall DAC control is executed efficiently and robustly.
