Module-level comment: The "adc" module interfaces an ADC for digital signal processing, parameterized by data sizes. It manages ADC operations via input clocks, data, and control signals, outputs ADC data and status, and configures and monitors ADC status through internal signals and a sub-module, "ZmodScopeController_0", that handles specific ADC control tasks such as initialization, data acquisition, and error management.
