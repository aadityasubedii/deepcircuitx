Module name: adc.
Module specification: The "adc" module is an interface to an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), parameterized by data size and designed to integrate with digital signal processing systems. It has several input ports: `i_sys_clock` acts as the main system clock; `i_adc_clock` as the ADC operation's clock; `i_nReset` is an active-low reset; `i_adc_data` carries the ADC's digital output data; `io_adc_sdio` is a bi-directional control and data line with the ADC; `i_adc_dco_clock_p` is the positive part of the differential data conversion clock from the ADC. The output ports include various signals such as differential clock signals (`o_adc_dco_clock_n`, `o_adc_clock_in_n`, `o_adc_clock_in_p`), control signals for ADC setup (`o_adc_sclk`, `o_adc_cs`, `o_adc_sync`), channel-related controls like gain and coupling (`o_adc_ch1_coupling_h`, `o_adc_ch1_coupling_l`, `o_adc_ch2_coupling_h`, `o_adc_ch2_coupling_l`, `o_adc_ch1_gain_h`, `o_adc_ch1_gain_l`, `o_adc_ch2_gain_h`, `o_adc_ch2_gain_l`), and signals for relay commands (`o_adc_relay_com_h`, `o_adc_relay_com_l`). The module also provides ADC data output `o_adc_data` and status signals like `o_adc_data_valid` and `o_adc_init_done`, indicating data validity and initialization completion, respectively.

Internal signals include `test_mode` for enabling test configurations, `enable_acquisition` for controlling data acquisition, `ready` as a status indicator, `data_overflow` for overflow detection, `init_done_relay` and `init_done_adc` signaling initialization completion for relay and ADC, `config_error` for configuration failures, and `reset_busy` to indicate reset activity.

The Verilog code implements the adc top-level module, including the instantiation of a "ZmodScopeController_0" sub-module responsible for managing the ADC initialization, configuration, data acquisition, and signal routing. It includes assignments to output signals and configuration of internal logic for conditions such as overflow or configuration errors. The specification captures the module's complex functionality, interfacing details, and technical nuances to ensure a firm understanding of its purpose and operation in a larger system context.
