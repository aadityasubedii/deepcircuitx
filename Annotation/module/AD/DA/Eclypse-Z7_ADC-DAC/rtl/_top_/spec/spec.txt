Module name: top. Module specification: The 'top' module orchestrates the functionality of an FPGA design primarily dealing with ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) and DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) operations. It is parameterized for different data sizes (ZMOD_DATA_SIZE), crucial for ADC and DAC operations. The module integrates several input ports: `i_clock` (main system clock), `i_reset` (system reset), `i_adc_data` (ADC data input), `io_adc_sdio` (bidirectional serial data for ADC), and `i_adc_dco_clock_p` (ADC clock for data synchronization). The output ports include various control, data, and clock signals for both ADC and DAC, like `o_adc_sclk`, `o_dac_cs`, and `o_led0_g` (green LED control), providing interfaces to external devices and indicating system statuses. Internally, the module utilizes derived clocks (`clock0`, `clock1`, `clock2`) and validity checks (`clocks_valid`) for synchronization and operational control. The `adc_data`, `adc_init_done`, and `adc_data_valid` manage the flow and integrity of ADC data, while `dac_init_done` handles the DAC preparedness for operations. The code structure is segmented into instantiation of sub-modules â€“ a clock unit, ADC module, DAC module, and a PMOD unit for peripheral management, each tailored for specific roles like clock management, data conversion, and user interface through LEDs. This architectural design ensures efficient data handling, modularity, and expandability in complex digital processing tasks.
