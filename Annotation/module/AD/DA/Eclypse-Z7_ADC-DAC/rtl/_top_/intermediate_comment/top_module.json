    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'top' module acts as an integrator for FPGA-based ADC/DAC operations, with data size configurability via ZMOD_DATA_SIZE. It initializes and manages clock domains, synchronizes data flows with internal controls, and interfaces with actual ADC/DAC hardware. Sub-modules for clocking (clock_unit), ADC (adc), DAC (dac), and status indication (pmod_unit) enable organized and modular design."
