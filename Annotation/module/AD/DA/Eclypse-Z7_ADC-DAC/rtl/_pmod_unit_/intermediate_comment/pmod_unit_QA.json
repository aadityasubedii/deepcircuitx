It operates on an input clock (`i_clock`) and a reset signal (`i_nReset`). The module monitors the initialization status of an ADC (`i_adc_init_done`) and a DAC (`i_dac_init_done`). Based on these statuses, the RGB LEDs (`o_led0_*` and `o_led1_*`) are controlled. Specifically, the red and green components of the LEDs are toggled using PWM to indicate whether the ADC or DAC is initialized, respectively. The PWM signal for the LEDs is generated using a counter (`led_pwm_counter`) that resets after reaching a specific tick count defined by `LED_PWM_TICKS`. Additionally, there is a second counter (`sec_counter`) that increments continuously and resets upon reaching `SEC_TICKS`, although its direct purpose regarding LED control is not demonstrated in the given code snippet."

The red component (`o_led0_r`) lights up based on the ADC initialization status and PWM control, whereas the green component (`o_led0_g`) reflects the PWM control inversely to the ADC initialization. The blue component is kept off (`o_led0_b` = 0).\n- `o_led1_r`, `o_led1_g`, `o_led1_b`: Similar to the first set of outputs, these control the second LED's red, green, and blue components, respectively. Here, the red component (`o_led1_r`) indicates the DAC initialization status alongside PWM control, and the green component (`o_led1_g`) functions inversely related to DAC initialization.
