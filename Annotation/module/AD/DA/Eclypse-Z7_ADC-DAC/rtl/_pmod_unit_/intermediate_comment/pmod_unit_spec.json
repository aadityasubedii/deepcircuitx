    "spec": "Module name: pmod_unit. Module specification: The `pmod_unit` is a Verilog module designed to manage the brightness and status indication of two RGB LEDs based on the initialization states of an ADC and a DAC. It utilizes an input clock (`i_clock`) for timing control and an asynchronous reset (`i_nReset`) to manage the internal states. The input signals `i_adc_init_done` and `i_dac_init_done` monitor the completion of the ADC and DAC initialization processes, respectively. The LEDs display different behaviors to indicate these states, with `o_led0_*` and `o_led1_*` controlling the RGB components of two separate LEDs. Internally, the module employs two main counters (`led_pwm_counter` and `sec_counter`) and a PWM signal (`led_pwm`). The `led_pwm_counter` determines the PWM brightness control for the LEDs by toggling the `led_pwm` signal, which resets upon reaching a predetermined tick value (`LED_PWM_TICKS`). The `sec_counter` increases up to a given number of clock cycles (`SEC_TICKS`), although its direct role in LED control isn't exemplified in the provided code snippet. The module contains two primary sections of code: one for resetting and incrementing the `led_pwm_counter` and generating the PWM signal, and another for managing the `sec_counter`. The output LED states are set based on the initialization signals intertwined with the `led_pwm` signal; for instance, `o_led0_r` and `o_led1_r` light up red only if the corresponding initialization is not done, modulated by the PWM for visible effects.",

It operates on an input clock (`i_clock`) and a reset signal (`i_nReset`). The module monitors the initialization status of an ADC (`i_adc_init_done`) and a DAC (`i_dac_init_done`). Based on these statuses, the RGB LEDs (`o_led0_*` and `o_led1_*`) are controlled. Specifically, the red and green components of the LEDs are toggled using PWM to indicate whether the ADC or DAC is initialized, respectively. The PWM signal for the LEDs is generated using a counter (`led_pwm_counter`) that resets after reaching a specific tick count defined by `LED_PWM_TICKS`. Additionally, there is a second counter (`sec_counter`) that increments continuously and resets upon reaching `SEC_TICKS`, although its direct purpose regarding LED control is not demonstrated in the given code snippet."
