    "module": "Module-level comment: The `pmod_unit` module controls two RGB LEDs to indicate ADC and DAC initialization states using PWM brightness control. Internally, it increments counters synchronized with the input clock, resetting based on predefined ticks. The PWM modulation is generated through `led_pwm_counter`, and output LEDs display initialization status with their red and green elements, conditioned by the ADC and DAC signals and the `led_pwm` output."
