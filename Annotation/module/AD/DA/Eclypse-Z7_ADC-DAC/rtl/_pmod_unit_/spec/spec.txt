Module name: pmod_unit. Module specification: The `pmod_unit` is a Verilog module designed to manage the brightness and status indication of two RGB LEDs based on the initialization states of an ADC and a DAC. It utilizes an input clock (`i_clock`) for timing control and an asynchronous reset (`i_nReset`) to manage the internal states. The input signals `i_adc_init_done` and `i_dac_init_done` monitor the completion of the ADC and DAC initialization processes, respectively. The LEDs display different behaviors to indicate these states, with `o_led0_*` and `o_led1_*` controlling the RGB components of two separate LEDs. Internally, the module employs two main counters (`led_pwm_counter` and `sec_counter`) and a PWM signal (`led_pwm`). The `led_pwm_counter` determines the PWM brightness control for the LEDs by toggling the `led_pwm` signal, which resets upon reaching a predetermined tick value (`LED_PWM_TICKS`). The `sec_counter` increases up to a given number of clock cycles (`SEC_TICKS`), although its direct role in LED control isn't exemplified in the provided code snippet. The module contains two primary sections of code: one for resetting and incrementing the `led_pwm_counter` and generating the PWM signal, and another for managing the `sec_counter`. The output LED states are set based on the initialization signals intertwined with the `led_pwm` signal; for instance, `o_led0_r` and `o_led1_r` light up red only if the corresponding initialization is not done, modulated by the PWM for visible effects.
