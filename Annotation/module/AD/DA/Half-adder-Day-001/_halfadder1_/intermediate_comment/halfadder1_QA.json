In this module, two single-bit binary inputs, labeled 'a' and 'b', are accepted and processed to produce two outputs: 'c' representing the carry bit and 's' representing the sum bit. The sum output 's' is calculated using the XOR operation on inputs 'a' and 'b', and the carry output 'c' is derived by performing an AND operation on the same inputs. This module captures the fundamental operation of adding two binary digits."

It is computed as the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) of the input bits 'a' and 'b'. The output 'c' is the carry bit of the addition. It results from the bitwise AND of the input bits 'a' and 'b' and indicates whether there is a carry out from the addition of the two bits."
