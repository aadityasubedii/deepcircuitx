Module name: halfadder1.
Module specification: The `halfadder1` module is a Verilog representation of a simple half adder circuit used for binary addition. This module's functionality is to add two single-bit binary inputs and produce a two-bit output consisting of a sum and a carry. It has two inputs, named 'a' and 'b', where each input accepts a single binary digit. The output 'c' represents the carry bit, generated using a bitwise AND operation indicating whether there is a carry out from the addition of the two bits. The output 's' is the sum bit, computed using a bitwise XOR operation which gives the sum of the two binary inputs without considering any carry input. There are no internal signals within this module, meaning that all operations are performed directly at the output assignments without the need for intermediate storage or additional logic processing. The module is straightforward, consisting of a declaration section that defines the input and output ports, followed by assignment statements that implement the sum and carry logic directly.
