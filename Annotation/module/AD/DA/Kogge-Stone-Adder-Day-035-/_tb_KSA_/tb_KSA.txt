Module-level comment: The `tb_KSA` is a testbench verifying the Kogge-Stone Adder, `KSA`. It sequentially applies binary values to 8-bit inputs `a` and `b`, and monitors the 8-bit `sum` and carry-out `carryout`. Stimuli are injected with 10 ns intervals, testing the `KSA`'s addition across varying inputs without internal signal processing.
