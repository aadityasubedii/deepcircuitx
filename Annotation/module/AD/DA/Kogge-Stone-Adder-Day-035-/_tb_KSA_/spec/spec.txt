Module name: tb_KSA. Module specification: The `tb_KSA` is a testbench module for validating the functionality of a Kogge-Stone Adder encapsulated in the `KSA` submodule. This module primarily manages the input stimuli and observes outputs to ensure accurate addition operations by the `KSA` submodule. It includes two 8-bit input vectors, `a` and `b`, used as operands for the addition. The outputs observed are the 8-bit sum (`sum`) and a single-bit carryout signal (`carryout`). The `a` and `b` inputs are sequentially assigned different binary values at 10-time unit intervals to simulate various addition scenarios and inspect `sum` and `carryout` responses. Despite the testbenchâ€™s simplified structure, it includes no explicit internal signals beyond the connection of the input and output ports to the `KSA` submodule. The code structure is segmented into declaration of inputs and outputs, instantiation of the `KSA` module, and an initial block that defines temporal behavior for testing different binary combinations on the inputs. This structured approach helps in systematically verifying the functionality of the addition operation implemented in the `KSA` module.
