Module-level comment: The 'KSA' module implements an 8-bit Kogge-Stone Adder using Verilog, designed for fast binary addition by minimizing carry propagation delay. It inputs two 8-bit numbers 'a' and 'b', computes internal carry generation (`g`) and propagation (`p`) signals, and hierarchically combines these through several stages (`cp`, `cg`, `ccp`, `ccg`, `cccp`, `cccg`) to produce a summed output `sum` and a `carryout` signal for overflow indication.
