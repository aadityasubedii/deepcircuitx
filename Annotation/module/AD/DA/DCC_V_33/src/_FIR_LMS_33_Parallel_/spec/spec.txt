Module name: `fir_lms`.

Module specification: The `fir_lms` module implements a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter with Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive functionality, designed for use in digital signal processing applications. It receives a clock signal (`clk`) for synchronization, an input signal (`x_in`) to be filtered, and a desired signal (`d_in`) for reference in adaptive filtering. The output ports include both high-precision 36-bit error (`e_out_36`) and filtered signal (`y_out_36`) outputs, as well as their truncated 14-bit counterparts (`e_out_14`, `y_out_14`), making the module adaptable to diverse precision requirements. Internally, the module utilizes arrays to store input samples (`x`) and filter coefficients (`f`), as well as registers and wires for handling the desired signal (`d`), scaled error (`emu`), and various intermediate signals (e.g., `y`, `e`, displaying filtered signal outputs and error calculations). The module consists of initial blocks for setting initial values, always blocks for sequential logic including coefficient updating and input sample shifting, and generate blocks employing instantiated multipliers for computing the product of input samples with filter coefficients, and with scaled error for coefficient adaptation. This structured approach provides an efficient mechanism for adaptively filtering input signals with the potential for optimizing signal approximation over time through coefficient adjustments, making it particularly suitable for dynamic signal processing environments.
