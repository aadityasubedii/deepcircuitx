    "module": "Module-level comment: The `fir_lms` module implements an adaptive FIR filter using the LMS algorithm, designed for digital signal processing. It synchronizes operations with a `clk` input and adapts to a desired signal (`d_in`) using error feedback on the `x_in` input. It features 36-bit full precision and 14-bit truncated outputs for the error and filtered signals. Internally, the module uses arrays to store historical input samples and filter coefficients, employs multipliers in procedural blocks for main operations, and updates coefficients adaptively based on error calculation, enhancing the filter's performance over time."
