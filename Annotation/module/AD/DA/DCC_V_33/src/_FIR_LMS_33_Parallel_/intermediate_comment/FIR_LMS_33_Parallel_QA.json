The FIR filter is parameterized by W1, W2, L, and Delay, allowing the precision and length of the filter to be defined at instantiation. The input to the filter is `x_in`, which represents the signal being processed. `d_in` is the desired signal, which is used to update the filter coefficients to minimize the error between the filter's output and `d_in`. \n\nThis adaptation uses the LMS algorithm to adjust the filter's coefficients (`f`) in a way that the error signal `e_out` is minimized over time. The module performs multiplication of the input signal with the filter coefficients, sums the results to produce the filtered output `y_out`, and then computes the error `e_out` by subtracting the scaled filter output from the desired signal `d`. \n\nThe error signal is used to adjust the coefficients of the filter. The update involves multiplying a scaled version of the error (`emu`) with the input samples and then updating the coefficients accordingly. The outputs `y_out_36` and `e_out_36` are the 36-bit wide untruncated outputs for both the filtered signal and error. `y_out_14` and `e_out_14` are truncated versions of the same outputs fitting the W1 bit-width. The Verilog code includes a pipelined multiplier instantiated within generated loops, which would typically be part of an IP core provided by hardware vendors. The module operates synchronously to the clock signal `clk`."
