Module name: DCC_V_33

Module specification: The module DCC_V_33 is a complex signal processing unit that primarily functions with various analog and digital signals. It includes a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), sine wave generation, filtering with FIR and LMS techniques, and interfaces with external ADCs and an audio interface converter. The input ports include the 3-bit OSC_50 oscillator signal, 4-bit KEY for user input, 18-bit SW for settings or modes, 14-bit analog-to-digital converter inputs (ADA_D, ADB_D), and their respective control signals (ADA_DCO, ADA_OR, ADB_DCO, ADB_OR), AIC_DOUT for audio data, as well as clock inputs (CLKIN1, XT_IN_N, XT_IN_P). Output ports manage interfaces and visual indicators such as 9-bit LEDG, 18-bit LEDR for displaying operational status, control signals for ADCs (AD_SCLK, AD_SDIO, ADA_OE, ADA_SPI_CS, ADB_OE, ADB_SPI_CS), audio data (AIC_DIN, AIC_BCLK, AIC_LRCIN, AIC_LRCOUT, AIC_SPI_CS, AIC_XCLK), clock outputs (CLKOUT0, FPGA_CLK_A_N/P, FPGA_CLK_B_N/P), and processed data (DA, DB). Internally, the module includes signals for reset (reset_n), system clocks with phase shifts (sys_clk, sys_clk_90deg, sys_clk_180deg, sys_clk_270deg), PLL lock status (pll_locked), sine wave generation (i_sine, is_sine, iu_sine), temporary storage for ADS data (per_a2da_d, per_a2db_d, a2da_data, a2db_data), a counter (count), FIR and LMS filtering signals (fir_in_data, fir_lms_in_data, fir_data_35/14, u_fir_data_14, u_fir_in_data, fir_lms_out_14, u_fir_lms_out_14, fir_lms_e_14, u_fir_lms_e_14), and intermediate processing registers (o_sine, os_sine, o_sine_p/n). The code contains blocks for PLL instance creation, sine wave generation, signal adding, ADC data handling, general counting, FIR filtering, and LMS error correction. Each block works cohesively to facilitate the acquisition, processing, and output of signal data in digital form.
