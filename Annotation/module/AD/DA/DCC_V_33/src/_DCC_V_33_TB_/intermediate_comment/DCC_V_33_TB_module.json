    "module": "Module-level comment: The `DCC_V_33_TB` is a testbench for verifying the `DCC_V_33` module. It simulates clock signals and input conditions using toggled `OSC_50`, `ADA_DCO`, and `ADB_DCO`, and initializes control signals (`KEY`, `SW`) to facilitate testing. Outputs are monitored through connected wires to assess DUT behavior. An `always` block generates clock stimuli, while an `initial` block sets the initial state and marks the beginning of the simulation."
