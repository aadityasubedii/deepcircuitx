Module-level comment: The "add" module performs 14-bit unsigned addition on inputs `dataa` and `datab`, producing a summed output `result`. This is achieved using the `lpm_add_sub` component configured for unsigned add operation without carry features, reflecting the sum directly in the output via internal wire `sub_wire0`.
