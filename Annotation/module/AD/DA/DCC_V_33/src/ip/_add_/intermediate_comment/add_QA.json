It uses an `lpm_add_sub` component, specifically configured to add these two inputs, resulting in a 14-bit output signal. The configuration parameters of the `lpm_add_sub` ensure that the operation is unsigned addition without using any carry-in or carry-out features. The resulting sum of the inputs `dataa` and `datab` is stored in the output `result`."

The `lpm_add_sub` component computes the sum of the inputs 'dataa' and 'datab', outputting the result onto 'sub_wire0'.
