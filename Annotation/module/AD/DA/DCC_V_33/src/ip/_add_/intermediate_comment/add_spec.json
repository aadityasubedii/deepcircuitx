Module specification: The \"add\" module is specifically designed to execute addition operations on two 14-bit unsigned input signals, dataa and datab, and provide the result in a 14-bit output signal, result. The module utilizes the `lpm_add_sub` component, which is configured to perform unsigned addition without carry-in or carry-out features, making the arithmetic operation simpler and direct. The inputs, dataa and datab, are crucial as they serve as the operands for the addition, and both are 14-bit signals treated as non-negative binary numbers. The sum of these inputs is presented on the output port result, which is connected internally to the wire sub_wire0. The sub_wire0 is an internal 14-bit signal that captures the output from the lpm_add_sub component before it is routed to the result output port. This interconnection ensures that the result of the summation is available externally for further usage. The code effectively organizes the connections, parameters, and configuration of the `lpm_add_sub` component to ensure the intended operation of addition is achieved flawlessly. The parameter settings within the `lpm_add_sub` block confirm the addition operation mode, signify the usage of unsigned representation, and specify the bit width, critical for maintaining data integrity and correct computation.",
