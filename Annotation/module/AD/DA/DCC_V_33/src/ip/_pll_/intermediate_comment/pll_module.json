    "module": "Module-level comment: The `pll` module utilizes an `altpll` component from Altera for generating four distinct clock outputs (`c0`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`) with configurable frequencies, phases, and duty cycles from a single input clock (`inclk0`). It includes an output (`locked`) for indicating PLL lock status. Internal signals facilitate input replication, formation of input vectors, and separation of output clocks, managed through parameters set using `defparam`. Tailored for \"Cyclone IV GX\" FPGA, providing essential functionality for diverse timing-critical applications."
