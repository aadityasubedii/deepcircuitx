Module name: pll. Module specification: The `pll` module encapsulates the functionality of a phase-locked loop (PLL) using the `altpll` component from Altera (now a part of Intel), specifically tailored for the "Cyclone IV GX" FPGA family. This module takes a single input clock signal, `inclk0`, and generates four distinct output clock signals, `c0`, `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`, each configurable in terms of frequency, duty cycle, and phase shift through Verilog `defparam` settings. An additional output, `locked`, signals when the PLL has successfully synchronized, indicating stable output frequencies. Internal to the module are various signals such as `sub_wire0` through `sub_wire8`, serving different purposes like replicating the input clock signal, forming a 2-bit vector for the `altpll` component's `inclk` port, extracting individual clock signals from the PLL output, and conveying the lock status. The Verilog code is structured around these functionalities, starting with the module declaration and port definitions, followed by the instantiation of internal signals and followed by the realization of the `altpll_component`. This component is configured through a series of `defparam` statements specifying the PLL's operational parameters like bandwidth type, input frequency, divide ratios, and duty cycles for each of the output clocks, and the intended device family. The setup ensures versatile, stable clock generation capabilities suitable for various timing-critical applications within FPGA-based designs.
