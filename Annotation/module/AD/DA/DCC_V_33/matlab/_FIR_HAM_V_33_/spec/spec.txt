Module name: FIR_HAM_V_33. Module specification: This module implements a 33-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using the Hamming window. It processes a 14-bit signed input signal (filter_in) through a delay pipeline, multiplying each delayed sample with pre-defined coefficients and summing the results to produce a 35-bit output (filter_out_35). The module also provides a 14-bit truncated output (filter_out_14) and a one-cycle delayed input (filter_in_out). It operates on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk) and includes an enable (clk_enable) and reset functionality. The internal structure consists of a delay pipeline (delay_pipeline) of 33 16-bit registers, multiplication units (product1-33), and a series of adders (sum1-32) to accum
