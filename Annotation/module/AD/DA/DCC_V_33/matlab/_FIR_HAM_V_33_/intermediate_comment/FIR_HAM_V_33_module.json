    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a 33-tap FIR filter using the Hamming window. It processes a 14-bit signed input through a delay pipeline, multiplies samples with pre-defined coefficients, and sums the results to produce a 35-bit output. The filter uses a symmetrical coefficient set for linear phase response. It includes a truncated 14-bit output and operates synchronously with clock enable and reset functionality. The implementation uses a shift register for sample delays, parallel multipliers, and a multi-stage adder tree for efficient computation."
