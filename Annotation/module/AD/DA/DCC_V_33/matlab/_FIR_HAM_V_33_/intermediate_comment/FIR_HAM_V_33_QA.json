It takes a 14-bit signed input signal and processes it through a delay pipeline, multiplying each delayed sample with pre-defined coefficients. The results are then summed to produce a 35-bit output. The module also provides a 14-bit truncated output. The filter operates on the rising edge of the clock signal and includes a reset functionality. The coefficients are symmetric, suggesting a linear phase response, which is typical for Hamming window FIR filters."
