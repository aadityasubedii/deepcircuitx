It utilizes an instantiated submodule, Clk15MHz_Clk15MHz_clk_wiz, which is likely a clock wizard or PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) module tailored for clock management. Within this submodule, the input 125 MHz clock signal is buffered and fed into a PLLE2_ADV primitive, which is a configurable PLL available in Xilinx FPGAs. The PLL is configured to output a 15 MHz clock based on the input frequency and its parameter settings (e.g., clock multipliers and dividers). The output clock is then buffered again before it is provided as the 15 MHz output. The code also includes `timescale directives for simulation purposes and an instantiated global module (glbl) typically used for global settings in FPGA designs but is not directly relevant to the core function of clock generation."
