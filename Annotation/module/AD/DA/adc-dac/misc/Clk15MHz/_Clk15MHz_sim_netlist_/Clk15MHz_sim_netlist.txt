Module-level comment: The Clk15MHz module generates a 15 MHz clock from a 125 MHz input using a PLL configured within the Clk15MHz_Clk15MHz_clk_wiz submodule. It employs input buffering via IBUF and output stabilization via BUFG, with specific PLL settings for multipliers, dividers, and phase adjustments to achieve the correct frequency output. The design focuses on accurate clock transformation suited for FPGA-based applications requiring a 15 MHz clock.
