Module name: Clk15MHz. Module specification: The Clk15MHz module is designed to generate a 15 MHz clock signal from a provided 125 MHz input clock signal, leveraging a submodule configured as a clock wizard or PLL. The input port, `clk_125MHz`, accepts the primary 125 MHz clock source, which is essential for the frequency transformation performed by the PLL. The output port, `clk_15MHz`, delivers the reduced 15 MHz clock signal, suitable for usage in other parts of the FPGA that require this specific frequency. Internally, the module employs signals such as `clk_125MHz_Clk15MHz` for buffering the input clock, and `clk_15MHz_Clk15MHz` for holding the PLL output prior to final buffering. Additional internal signals include feedback paths (`clkfbout_Clk15MHz`, `clkfbout_buf_Clk15MHz`) and various unconnected outputs and flags from the PLL, which indicate non-utilization in this context. Key components of the Verilog code include the Clk15MHz_Clk15MHz_clk_wiz submodule housing the PLL configuration, IBUF and BUFG components for signal integrity, and a comprehensive set-up of the PLL's parameters such as feedback multipliers, input and output divisions and phase settings to achieve the desired clock transformation. The code also includes a simulation `timescale` declaration and a `glbl` module for additional global settings, which although typically necessary for the FPGA environment, are not directly influencing the core function of the 15 MHz clock generation.
