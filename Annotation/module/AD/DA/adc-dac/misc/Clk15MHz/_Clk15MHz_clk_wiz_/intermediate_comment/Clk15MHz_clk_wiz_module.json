    "module": "Module-level comment: The Clk15MHz_clk_wiz module converts a 125MHz input clock to a 15MHz output clock using the Xilinx PLLE2_ADV primitive. It starts with a input buffer (IBUF) for signal integrity, utilizes the PLL for frequency reduction based on defined parameters, and uses feedback and output buffers (BUFG) to ensure stability and integrity of the clock signals provided for external use."
