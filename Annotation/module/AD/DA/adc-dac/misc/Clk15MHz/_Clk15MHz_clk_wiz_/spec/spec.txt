Module name: Clk15MHz_clk_wiz.

Module specification: The Clk15MHz_clk_wiz module primarily serves to generate a 15MHz clock signal derived from a 125MHz input clock. It features inputs and outputs for the clock signals; the input port 'clk_125MHz' receives the reference 125MHz clock signal, while the output port 'clk_15MHz' delivers the 15MHz clock signal desired for downstream use. Internally, the module utilizes a sequence of signal conditioning and clock management components. The 'clk_125MHz_Clk15MHz' acts as a buffered version of the input clock, catering to PLL input requirements. The 'clk_15MHz_Clk15MHz' is the raw 15MHz output from the PLL, subsequently passed through a BUFG to ensure clock signal integrity as the final 'clk_15MHz' output. Several other internal signals, such as 'clkfbout_Clk15MHz' and 'locked_int', facilitate the monitoring and feedback control of the Phase-Locked Loop, though many are left unused as openly offered by the PLLE2_ADV primitive but unneeded for the module's intent.

The module embeds the PLLE2_ADV primitive, suitably parameterized to achieve the frequency translation. Further sections encapsulate input buffering for signal integrity (clkin1_ibufg), PLL feedback loop buffering (clkf_buf), and output buffering for the reduced 15MHz clock (clkout1_buf). These sections collectively ensure that the high-frequency input clock is cleanly ingested by the PLL, accurately adjusted, and delivered as a stable output for use in the larger digital system.
