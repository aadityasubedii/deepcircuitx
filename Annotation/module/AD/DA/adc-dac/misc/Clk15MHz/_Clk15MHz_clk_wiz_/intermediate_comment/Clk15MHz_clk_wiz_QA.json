It uses an instance of the PLLE2_ADV primitive, a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) provided by Xilinx for clock management purposes in FPGA designs. The PLLE2_ADV is configured with specific parameters such as input frequency, feedback multiplier, and output divider to produce the desired output clock frequency. The input clock signal is first passed through an input buffer (IBUF) to optimize signal integrity. The generated 15MHz clock is then buffered by a BUFG before being output from the module. Several unused output clocks and monitoring signals are left unconnected, indicating that this instance of the PLL is dedicated solely to generating the 15MHz output clock."
