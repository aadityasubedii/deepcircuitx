    "spec": "Module name: Clk15MHz_clk_wiz.\n\nModule specification: The Clk15MHz_clk_wiz module primarily serves to generate a 15MHz clock signal derived from a 125MHz input clock. It features inputs and outputs for the clock signals; the input port 'clk_125MHz' receives the reference 125MHz clock signal, while the output port 'clk_15MHz' delivers the 15MHz clock signal desired for downstream use. Internally, the module utilizes a sequence of signal conditioning and clock management components. The 'clk_125MHz_Clk15MHz' acts as a buffered version of the input clock, catering to PLL input requirements. The 'clk_15MHz_Clk15MHz' is the raw 15MHz output from the PLL, subsequently passed through a BUFG to ensure clock signal integrity as the final 'clk_15MHz' output. Several other internal signals, such as 'clkfbout_Clk15MHz' and 'locked_int', facilitate the monitoring and feedback control of the Phase-Locked Loop, though many are left unused as openly offered by the PLLE2_ADV primitive but unneeded for the module's intent.\n\nThe module embeds the PLLE2_ADV primitive, suitably parameterized to achieve the frequency translation. Further sections encapsulate input buffering for signal integrity (clkin1_ibufg), PLL feedback loop buffering (clkf_buf), and output buffering for the reduced 15MHz clock (clkout1_buf). These sections collectively ensure that the high-frequency input clock is cleanly ingested by the PLL, accurately adjusted, and delivered as a stable output for use in the larger digital system.",

It uses an instance of the PLLE2_ADV primitive, a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) provided by Xilinx for clock management purposes in FPGA designs. The PLLE2_ADV is configured with specific parameters such as input frequency, feedback multiplier, and output divider to produce the desired output clock frequency. The input clock signal is first passed through an input buffer (IBUF) to optimize signal integrity. The generated 15MHz clock is then buffered by a BUFG before being output from the module. Several unused output clocks and monitoring signals are left unconnected, indicating that this instance of the PLL is dedicated solely to generating the 15MHz output clock."

It features inputs and outputs for the clock signals; the input port 'clk_125MHz' receives the reference 125MHz clock signal, while the output port 'clk_15MHz' delivers the 15MHz clock signal desired for downstream use. Internally, the module utilizes a sequence of signal conditioning and clock management components. The 'clk_125MHz_Clk15MHz' acts as a buffered version of the input clock, catering to PLL input requirements. The 'clk_15MHz_Clk15MHz' is the raw 15MHz output from the PLL, subsequently passed through a BUFG to ensure clock signal integrity as the final 'clk_15MHz' output. Several other internal signals, such as 'clkfbout_Clk15MHz' and 'locked_int', facilitate the monitoring and feedback control of the Phase-Locked Loop, though many are left unused as openly offered by the PLLE2_ADV primitive but unneeded for the module's intent.\n\nThe module embeds the PLLE2_ADV primitive, suitably parameterized to achieve the frequency translation. Further sections encapsulate input buffering for signal integrity (clkin1_ibufg), PLL feedback loop buffering (clkf_buf), and output buffering for the reduced 15MHz clock (clkout1_buf). These sections collectively ensure that the high-frequency input clock is cleanly ingested by the PLL, accurately adjusted, and delivered as a stable output for use in the larger digital system."
