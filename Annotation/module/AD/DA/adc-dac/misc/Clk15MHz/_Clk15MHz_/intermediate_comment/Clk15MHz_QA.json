This is achieved by utilizing a clock wizard component named 'Clk15MHz_clk_wiz', which is presumably configured with specific properties as indicated in the attributes within the CORE_GENERATION_INFO. These configurations suggest the module utilizes a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) for clock management and is purposely set for phase alignment without dynamic reconfigurations or additional complex functionalities like power down, reset, or feedback adjustments. This setup primarily serves the objective of scaling down the provided 125MHz clock to a lower frequency of 15MHz."

This signal is provided to the clock wizard instance within the module to be scaled down to the desired 15 MHz output clock.\n\nOutput ports: clk_15MHz.\nExplanation: The 'clk_15MHz' port is an output from the 'Clk15MHz' module.

The code straightforwardly connects the external input and output directly through the instance of `Clk15MHz_clk_wiz`. This instance configuration suggests that any required signal manipulation (such as division, buffering, or filtering) to generate the 15 MHz clock from the 125 MHz input is managed internally by the `Clk15MHz_clk_wiz` module itself. Thus, the primary role of this `Clk15MHz` module is to encapsulate and specifically instantiate the clock wizard without additional internal signal processing or intermediate signal stages evident in the available code."
