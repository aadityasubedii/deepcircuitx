Module-level comment: The 'Clk15MHz' module downscales a 125 MHz input clock to a 15 MHz output clock using an instantiated clock wizard ('Clk15MHz_clk_wiz'). It relies on internal PLL settings configured for phase-aligned output without extra features like dynamic reconfiguration or power management. No internal signals are used; the clock wizard directly connects the input and output ports, encapsulating the frequency division process.
