As specified in the CORE_GENERATION_INFO attribute, the clock wizard uses phase alignment to provide stable clock output and integrates a PLL for frequency scaling without options like phase shifting, clock switchover, dynamic reconfiguration, power down, or reset mechanisms, indicating a straightforward clock division process. The module has one input port, 'clk_125MHz', which receives the higher frequency clock signal, and one output port, 'clk_15MHz', which delivers the scaled down clock signal to subsequent system components. The module contains no explicit internal signals in its Verilog code; rather, any necessary signal manipulation is handled internally by the instantiated clock wizard module. The code structure begins with a `timescale directive for simulation purposes, followed by an attribute encapsulating the configuration parameters for the 'Clk15MHz' module, leading to the module definition that includes port declarations and the instantiation of the clock wizard, bounding the module's functionality to scaling the input clock to the desired frequency without additional complexities.",
