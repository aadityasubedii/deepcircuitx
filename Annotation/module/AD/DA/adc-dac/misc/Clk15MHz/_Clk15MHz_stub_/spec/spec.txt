Module name: Clk15MHz.

Module specification: The Clk15MHz module is designed to function within a digital logic system that requires a clock signal of 15MHz derived from an input clock source of 125MHz. The only input port is `clk_125MHz`, which is intended to connect to a 125MHz clock source provided by the system in which this module will be integrated. The sole output port is `clk_15MHz`, configured to produce a clock signal with a frequency of 15MHz. As per the current code provided, this module does not yet implement any form of logic or internal signals, thus no frequency division or clock management is taking place. For the module to function as intended, additional code defining internal signals and the required logic to divide down the frequency from 125MHz to 15MHz needs to be added. Internal signals, when defined, will be involved in the clock division process and will likely include counters or registers to keep track of the input clock cycles and generate the scaled-down clock output. The body of the code should have sections to initialize and process these signals to handle the clock division and ensure a stable clock output at the desired frequency. However, since this information is currently absent, the specification can only assume the intended functionality and internal structure that would be required for a module named Clk15MHz to operate correctly.
