Module-level comment: The Clk15MHz module is intended to generate a 15MHz clock from a 125MHz input clock. Currently, the module includes only the definitions for the input (`clk_125MHz`) and output (`clk_15MHz`) ports without implementing any internal logic or signals. The actual frequency division required to derive the 15MHz clock needs to be added through internal counters or logic gates in future revisions of the module.
