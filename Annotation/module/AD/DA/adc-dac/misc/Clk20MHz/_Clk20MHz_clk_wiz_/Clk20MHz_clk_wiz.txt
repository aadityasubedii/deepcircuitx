Module-level comment: The Clk20MHz_clk_wiz module generates a 20 MHz clock from a 125 MHz input using an MMCM. It buffers the input clock with an IBUF, configures MMCM with fixed parameters for frequency division, and buffers the output with a BUFG. Internal signals and unused MMCM outputs are managed for signal integrity and unused features are statically defined.
