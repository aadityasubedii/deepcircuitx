    "spec": "Module name: Clk20MHz_clk_wiz.\nModule specification: The Clk20MHz_clk_wiz module is a specialized hardware component in Verilog designed to downscale a 125 MHz input clock signal to a 20 MHz output clock signal using a Mixed-Mode Clock Manager (MMCM) for clock management. It features a single input port, `clk_125MHz`, which accepts the original 125 MHz clock signal, and a single output port, `clk_20MHz`, providing the resulting 20 MHz clock. Internally, the module contains multiple signals such as `clk_125MHz_Clk20MHz` as the buffered version of the input clock, multiple unused `clk_out2_Clk20MHz` to `clk_out7_Clk20MHz` signals intended for additional clock outputs that are not used, `locked_int` for indicating MMCM's lock status, and several configuration signals like `do_unused`, `drdy_unused`, and `psdone_unused` linked to the MMCM's dynamic reconfiguration features. The code includes an IBUF to buffer the input clock, an MMCM instantiated with specified parameters for clock synthesis and management, and BUFGs to buffer the MMCM's output and feedback signal ensuring proper operation and reliability of the clock signal. This module provides a clean, buffered 20 MHz clock signal for use in digital circuits requiring this specific frequency, without using advanced dynamic reconfiguration capabilities or additional MMCM-generated clocks.",

It serves the purpose of providing a clean, stable clock signal to the MMCM for frequency synthesis.\n- `clk_in2_Clk20MHz`: Declared but not used in the provided code snippet. It could potentially serve as a placeholder for an alternative clock input.\n- `clk_20MHz_Clk20MHz`: The direct output of the MMCM which provides a 20 MHz clock signal before being buffered by a BUFG to produce the final `clk_20MHz` output.\n- `clk_out2_Clk20MHz` - `clk_out7_Clk20MHz`: Declared but not used in the provided module.

                    "text": "Module name: Clk20MHz_clk_wiz.\nModule specification: The Clk20MHz_clk_wiz module is a specialized hardware component in Verilog designed to downscale a 125 MHz input clock signal to a 20 MHz output clock signal using a Mixed-Mode Clock Manager (MMCM) for clock management. It features a single input port, `clk_125MHz`, which accepts the original 125 MHz clock signal, and a single output port, `clk_20MHz`, providing the resulting 20 MHz clock. Internally, the module contains multiple signals such as `clk_125MHz_Clk20MHz` as the buffered version of the input clock, multiple unused `clk_out2_Clk20MHz` to `clk_out7_Clk20MHz` signals intended for additional clock outputs that are not used, `locked_int` for indicating MMCM's lock status, and several configuration signals like `do_unused`, `drdy_unused`, and `psdone_unused` linked to the MMCM's dynamic reconfiguration features. The code includes an IBUF to buffer the input clock, an MMCM instantiated with specified parameters for clock synthesis and management, and BUFGs to buffer the MMCM's output and feedback signal ensuring proper operation and reliability of the clock signal. This module provides a clean, buffered 20 MHz clock signal for use in digital circuits requiring this specific frequency, without using advanced dynamic reconfiguration capabilities or additional MMCM-generated clocks."
