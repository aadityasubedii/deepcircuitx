    "spec": "Module name: Clk20MHz. Module specification: The Clk20MHz is a Verilog module designed to generate a 20 MHz clock signal from a 125 MHz input clock. It achieves this functionality by using a clock wizard tool encapsulated within the 'Clk20MHz_clk_wiz' instance, which utilizes clock synthesis techniques involving phase-locked loop (PLL) or mixed-mode clock manager (MMCM) technology. The module includes one input port `clk_125MHz` that accepts the 125 MHz clock signal and one output port `clk_20MHz` that provides the reduced 20 MHz clock signal. There are no internal signals explicitly defined within this module since it acts primarily as a wrapper for the clock wizard. The code comprises the timescale directive, a CORE_GENERATION_INFO attribute for configuration of the clock wizard, and the module's port and instantiation setup. Each component and attribute is strategically placed to ensure efficient clock conversion and clear module definition within digital circuits requiring different clock frequencies.",

It uses a clock wizard instance, which is likely a vendor-specific module or tool that makes it easier to generate clocks with different frequencies, phase alignment, jitter control, etc. There's a timescale directive at the top of the code that sets the time unit and precision to 1 picosecond, although timescale is not directly related to the module's function. The module itself contains just an instantiation of \"Clk20MHz_clk_wiz\" with the output clock signal named `clk_20MHz` and the input clock signal named `clk_125MHz`.
