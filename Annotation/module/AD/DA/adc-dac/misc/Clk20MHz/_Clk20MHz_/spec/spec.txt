Module name: Clk20MHz. Module specification: The Clk20MHz is a Verilog module designed to generate a 20 MHz clock signal from a 125 MHz input clock. It achieves this functionality by using a clock wizard tool encapsulated within the 'Clk20MHz_clk_wiz' instance, which utilizes clock synthesis techniques involving phase-locked loop (PLL) or mixed-mode clock manager (MMCM) technology. The module includes one input port `clk_125MHz` that accepts the 125 MHz clock signal and one output port `clk_20MHz` that provides the reduced 20 MHz clock signal. There are no internal signals explicitly defined within this module since it acts primarily as a wrapper for the clock wizard. The code comprises the timescale directive, a CORE_GENERATION_INFO attribute for configuration of the clock wizard, and the module's port and instantiation setup. Each component and attribute is strategically placed to ensure efficient clock conversion and clear module definition within digital circuits requiring different clock frequencies.
