It instantiates a submodule called Clk20MHz_clk_wiz, which uses a Mixed-Mode Clock Manager (MMCM) to perform the clock division. The MMCM is configured through the MMCME2_ADV primitive to divide the input clock frequency to obtain the desired output clock frequency of 20 MHz. The input and output clocks are buffered using input and output buffer primitives (IBUF, BUFG) to ensure signal integrity. This module is likely used within FPGA designs that require a specific clock frequency for operation, separate from the raw clock inputs available."
