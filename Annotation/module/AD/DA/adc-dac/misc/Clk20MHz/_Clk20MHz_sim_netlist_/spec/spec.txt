Module name: Clk20MHz.
Module specification: The Clk20MHz module is engineered to generate a 20 MHz clock signal from a 125 MHz input clock. It consists of two main ports: the input port `clk_125MHz` which receives the external 125 MHz clock signal, and the output port `clk_20MHz` which provides the derived 20 MHz clock signal. Internally, the module encapsulates the Clk20MHz_clk_wiz submodule that utilizes the MMCM (Mixed-Mode Clock Manager) primitive for clock management. Within this submodule, several internal signals are at play: buffered versions of the input (`clk_125MHz_Clk20MHz`) and output (`clk_20MHz_Clk20MHz`) signals, MMCM feedback signals (`clkfbout_Clk20MHz` and `clkfbout_buf_Clk20MHz`), and numerous unconnected signals (prefixed with "NLW_mmcm_adv_inst_") that denote unused MMCM outputs. The code includes necessary instantiations and configurations of BUFG, IBUF, and MMCME2_ADV primitives to implement the desired clock manipulation. Also present in the Verilog file is the `glbl` module which is a global simulation construct used in Xilinx simulations to provide global signals, such as the global set/reset (`GSR`). This comprehensive module integrates clock synthesis, buffering, and feedback to generate a stable 20 MHz clock, suitable for FPGA applications requiring precise clock frequencies.
