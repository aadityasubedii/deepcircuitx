Module-level comment: The Clk20MHz module defines an input/output interface for frequency conversion, accepting a 125 MHz clock (`clk_125MHz`) and intended to output a 20 MHz clock (`clk_20MHz`). Currently, it lacks implementation details and internal logic for the frequency division process, serving as a template for further development.
