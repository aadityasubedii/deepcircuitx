Module specification: The Clk20MHz module is designed as a placeholder for a clock domain conversion operation that takes a 125 MHz input clock signal and is intended to output a 20 MHz clock signal. It comprises an input port named `clk_125MHz`, which is designated for receiving the 125 MHz base clock signal. The output port is named `clk_20MHz`, aiming to provide a reduced frequency clock output of 20 MHz. The module lacks internal signals and does not exhibit any internal logic, indicating that the detailed implementation of frequency division and clock generation is yet to be outlined within this module's structure. Consequently, there are no blocks or sections of code within this shell, as it serves solely as an interface template awaiting further development for its intended functionality.",
