/* Memory Initialization Vector
   This code defines a hexadecimal memory initialization vector for preloading
   data into a memory block (e.g., ROM or RAM) in FPGA or ASIC designs.
   It sets the radix to 16 (hexadecimal) and provides an extensive list of
   32-bit values to be loaded sequentially into memory addresses upon
   system startup or reset. The vector contains 1024 entries, suggesting
   a 4KB memory block initialization. */
