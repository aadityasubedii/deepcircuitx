Module name: ads7883.
Module specification: The ads7883 module is designed to interface with the ADS7883 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) via a serial communication protocol, handling timing and data assembly for digital conversion results. It utilizes input ports: `clk` for the main clock signal that orchestrates the timing of all operations, `en` as an enable signal to initiate the communication process with the ADC, and `sdo` for receiving the serial data output from the ADC. The output ports include: `cs` for the chip select signal, activating the ADC, `sck` as the serial clock to synchronize data transmission, and `data`, a 12-bit register holding the conversion results assembled from `sdo`. Internally, the module employs a 4-bit counter `cnt16`, which tracks the serial clock cycles and controls the `cs` signal and data assembly process, and a 12-bit shift register `data_` for sequentially constructing the ADC output data. The Verilog code is structured into a main always block that operates on the positive edge of the clock signal. Within this block, the functionality is split based on the state of `en` and `cs`. When `en` is high, it initializes `cs`, `cnt16`, and `sck` to begin communication. If `cs` is low, indicating active communication, it toggles `sck`, uses `cnt16` for counting the bit transfers, and shifts the received bits into `data_`. Upon completing the data capture (after 16 clock cycles), the module transfers the final 12-bit value to the `data` output. This design ensures synchronization and accurate data capture from the ADC, packaging the functionality into a concise and efficient module for interfacing with the ADS7883 ADC.
