    "module": "Module-level comment: The ads7883 module interfaces with the ADS7883 ADC via serial communication, controlling data capture and synchronization. It uses input ports (clk, en, sdo) and outputs (cs, sck, data), with internal counters (cnt16) and a shift register (data_) to manage data assembly and transfer. On each clock edge, it checks enable status, toggles serial clocks, manages chip select, and assembles the ADC's digital output efficiently."
