    "spec": "Module name: ads7883.\nModule specification: The ads7883 module is designed to interface with the ADS7883 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) via a serial communication protocol, handling timing and data assembly for digital conversion results. It utilizes input ports: `clk` for the main clock signal that orchestrates the timing of all operations, `en` as an enable signal to initiate the communication process with the ADC, and `sdo` for receiving the serial data output from the ADC. The output ports include: `cs` for the chip select signal, activating the ADC, `sck` as the serial clock to synchronize data transmission, and `data`, a 12-bit register holding the conversion results assembled from `sdo`. Internally, the module employs a 4-bit counter `cnt16`, which tracks the serial clock cycles and controls the `cs` signal and data assembly process, and a 12-bit shift register `data_` for sequentially constructing the ADC output data. The Verilog code is structured into a main always block that operates on the positive edge of the clock signal. Within this block, the functionality is split based on the state of `en` and `cs`. When `en` is high, it initializes `cs`, `cnt16`, and `sck` to begin communication. If `cs` is low, indicating active communication, it toggles `sck`, uses `cnt16` for counting the bit transfers, and shifts the received bits into `data_`. Upon completing the data capture (after 16 clock cycles), the module transfers the final 12-bit value to the `data` output. This design ensures synchronization and accurate data capture from the ADC, packaging the functionality into a concise and efficient module for interfacing with the ADS7883 ADC.",

It manages the serial clock (sck), chip select (cs), and serial data output (sdo) based on the input clock (clk) and enable signal (en).
