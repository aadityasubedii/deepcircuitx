It manages the serial clock (sck), chip select (cs), and serial data output (sdo) based on the input clock (clk) and enable signal (en). When enabled, it initiates communication by pulling the chip select low and toggles the serial clock to read bits from the ADC into a register, assembling them into a 12-bit word. Once all bits are read, the data is transferred to the output. The process ensures proper timing and synchronization for accurate data capture from the ADC."

When enabled, the module begins the communication process with the ADC.\n- sdo: Serial Data Output from the ADC to the module.

It is used to activate the ADC before data transfer begins and is toggled as per the enable signal and internal counters.\n- sck: Serial Clock output. The module generates this clock to synchronize the serial data transmission from the ADC.\n- data: The final 12-bit output data from the ADC, assembled internally from the serial bits received via sdo.
