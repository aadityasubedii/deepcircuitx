    "spec": "Module name: DAC_Ctrl.\nModule specification:\nThe DAC_Ctrl module is designed to control a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) by managing the chip select (CS) and serial clock (SCLK) signals essential for the proper timing of DAC communication. The input port `clk` is the primary clock signal driving the state machine and control signal toggling within the module. The output ports include `CS`, which activates the DAC when low, and `SCLK`, a clock signal for serial data transmission. Internally, `num` serves as a counter that increments upon each clock cycle when the DAC is active, reset after 34 counts. The `cs` register maps to the CS output and indicates the DAC's active idle state, while `sclk` toggles with each clock edge to create the SCLK signal. The `state` and `next_state` registers dictate the current and future states of the module, respectively. The code consists of an initialization block to set default values, sequential blocks to toggle `sclk`, update the current state `state`, manage the CS line through `cs`, and determine the `next_state`. The `case` statements in sequential blocks deal with state transitions and CS signal activation, modulated by the counter `num`.\n\nModule name: UseDAC.\nModule specification:\nThe UseDAC module functions as an interface to the DAC_Ctrl, handling a modified clock signal and serial data transmission to a DAC. The input ports consist of `clk`, the primary clock signal used for operations within UseDAC, and `data`, a 16-bit digital value intended for DAC conversion. The module provides output ports such as `CS`, controlled by DAC_Ctrl, `SCLK`, the clock to DAC_Ctrl, and `SerialData` that streams the serialized data to the DAC. Internally, `i` is a counter used to create a divided clock `sclk2`, assigned to `SCLK2` for the DAC_Ctrl. Edge detection for serial communications is facilitated through `ori1`, `ori2`, and the edge detection signal `en`. `Data` is a 17-bit register that prepares the digital input for serialization, appended with an additional zero for MSB-first transmission. The `serialdata` register is connected to the `SerialData` output and holds the currently transmitting bit. An additional counter `num` keeps track of the transmission progress. The code comprises initialization blocks, sequential logic for clock division and signal toggling, a block for rising-edge detection utilizing `ori` registers, and serial data management procedures. The instantiation of DAC_Ctrl within UseDAC allows for a coupled operation where UseDAC generates required clocks and manages data serialization while DAC_Ctrl provides control signaling.",

It manages the chip select signal (CS) and the serial clock (SCLK) for the DAC communication. The module generates a toggling clock signal for SCLK and controls the CS line based on the state and a counter `num`. When the state is 0 (idle), CS is high (inactive), and when in state 1 (active), CS is low (active) and the counter `num` increments with every clock cycle until it reaches 34, then resets to 0, managing transitions between states.\n\n- **UseDAC**: This module interfaces with the DAC_Ctrl by providing a modified clock signal and handling serial data transmission. It includes a counter `i` to modify the input clock signal `clk` to generate `SCLK2`. It uses the `DAC_Ctrl` module for controlling CS and SCLK. Serial data is prepared and sent based on the DAC\u2019s serialization requirements. The module detects edges on the CS signal to time the serialization of the input data, which is shifted out bit by bit on the falling edges of SCLK when CS is active (low). This setup ensures proper timing and data formatting for DAC communication."

The module provides output ports such as `CS`, controlled by DAC_Ctrl, `SCLK`, the clock to DAC_Ctrl, and `SerialData` that streams the serialized data to the DAC. Internally, `i` is a counter used to create a divided clock `sclk2`, assigned to `SCLK2` for the DAC_Ctrl. Edge detection for serial communications is facilitated through `ori1`, `ori2`, and the edge detection signal `en`. `Data` is a 17-bit register that prepares the digital input for serialization, appended with an additional zero for MSB-first transmission. The `serialdata` register is connected to the `SerialData` output and holds the currently transmitting bit. An additional counter `num` keeps track of the transmission progress. The code comprises initialization blocks, sequential logic for clock division and signal toggling, a block for rising-edge detection utilizing `ori` registers, and serial data management procedures. The instantiation of DAC_Ctrl within UseDAC allows for a coupled operation where UseDAC generates required clocks and manages data serialization while DAC_Ctrl provides control signaling."
