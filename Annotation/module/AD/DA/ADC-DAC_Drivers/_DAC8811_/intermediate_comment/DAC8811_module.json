    "module": "Module-level comment: The DAC_Ctrl module controls DAC operation, toggling chip select (CS) and serial clock (SCLK) signals for data communication. It uses an internal counter to manage the CS state and SCLK generation, transitioning between active and idle states based on the clock input. State changes are handled by a simple state machine, with `num` resetting upon reaching a predefined count, ensuring correct timing for DAC interfacing."
