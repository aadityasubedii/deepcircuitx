Module name: DAC_Ctrl.
Module specification:
The DAC_Ctrl module is designed to control a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) by managing the chip select (CS) and serial clock (SCLK) signals essential for the proper timing of DAC communication. The input port `clk` is the primary clock signal driving the state machine and control signal toggling within the module. The output ports include `CS`, which activates the DAC when low, and `SCLK`, a clock signal for serial data transmission. Internally, `num` serves as a counter that increments upon each clock cycle when the DAC is active, reset after 34 counts. The `cs` register maps to the CS output and indicates the DAC's active idle state, while `sclk` toggles with each clock edge to create the SCLK signal. The `state` and `next_state` registers dictate the current and future states of the module, respectively. The code consists of an initialization block to set default values, sequential blocks to toggle `sclk`, update the current state `state`, manage the CS line through `cs`, and determine the `next_state`. The `case` statements in sequential blocks deal with state transitions and CS signal activation, modulated by the counter `num`.

Module name: UseDAC.
Module specification:
The UseDAC module functions as an interface to the DAC_Ctrl, handling a modified clock signal and serial data transmission to a DAC. The input ports consist of `clk`, the primary clock signal used for operations within UseDAC, and `data`, a 16-bit digital value intended for DAC conversion. The module provides output ports such as `CS`, controlled by DAC_Ctrl, `SCLK`, the clock to DAC_Ctrl, and `SerialData` that streams the serialized data to the DAC. Internally, `i` is a counter used to create a divided clock `sclk2`, assigned to `SCLK2` for the DAC_Ctrl. Edge detection for serial communications is facilitated through `ori1`, `ori2`, and the edge detection signal `en`. `Data` is a 17-bit register that prepares the digital input for serialization, appended with an additional zero for MSB-first transmission. The `serialdata` register is connected to the `SerialData` output and holds the currently transmitting bit. An additional counter `num` keeps track of the transmission progress. The code comprises initialization blocks, sequential logic for clock division and signal toggling, a block for rising-edge detection utilizing `ori` registers, and serial data management procedures. The instantiation of DAC_Ctrl within UseDAC allows for a coupled operation where UseDAC generates required clocks and manages data serialization while DAC_Ctrl provides control signaling.
