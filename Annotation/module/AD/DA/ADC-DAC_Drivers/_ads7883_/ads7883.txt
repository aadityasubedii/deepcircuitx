Module-level comment: The 'ads7883' Verilog module interfaces with an ADS7883 ADC, using SPI protocol for digitizing analog signals. It initiates communication on enable (`en`), reads 12-bit samples via serial data output (`sdo`), and indicates active/idle states with `adc_idle`. Internally, it employs counters for SPI clock management (`cnt4`) and bit tracking (`cnt16`), and a shift register (`data_`) for temporary data storage, outputting the final result to `data`.
