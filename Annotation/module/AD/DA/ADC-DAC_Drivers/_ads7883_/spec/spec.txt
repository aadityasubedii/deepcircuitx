Module name: ads7883. Module specification: The 'ads7883' module is a Verilog RTL design for interfacing with the ADS7883 ADC chip using an SPI communication protocol, primarily employed in ASICs or FPGAs. The module takes a clock signal (`clk`) as an input which drives the entire sampling and synchronization process. It also uses an enable signal (`en`) to start ADC sampling, and a serial data output (`sdo`) from the ADC. For outputs, the module provides a chip select signal (`cs`), a serial clock (`sck`), a 12-bit data bus (`data`), and an ADC idle signal (`adc_idle`) indicating the sampling status. Internally, the module includes a 2-bit counter (`cnt4`) for toggling `sck` signal and a 4-bit counter (`cnt16`) to keep track of the bit count of ADC data. A temporary data register (`data_`) captures the incoming bits, which are eventually transferred to the output `data`. The module operates by asserting `cs` low upon enable and sequentially managing `sck` to read bits from `sdo` into `data_`. The feed continues until 12 bits are read, after which `cs` is deactivated. The module toggles the state of `sample_state` to indicate whether the ADC is actively sampling (`1`) or idle (`0`), which directly maps to the `adc_idle` output. Starting with the activation of the `en` input, the module initializes all counters and asserts `cs` low, cycling through the data capture phase as driven by changes in `cnt4` and `cnt16`. The code then deactivates `cs` and sets `sample_state` to low, marking the end of the transaction. This structured sequence ensures seamless ADC data capture and transfer suited for high-speed digital applications.
