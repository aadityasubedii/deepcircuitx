Module name: ADC_Ctrl. Module specification: The `ADC_Ctrl` module is designed primarily to manage and control the operation of an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). It generates the necessary control signals and sequences the data reading process aligned with a clock signal. The inputs to the module include `clk` for the clock signal and `DOUT` for the serial digital output from the ADC. The outputs include `CS` (Chip Select), `DCLOCK` (conversion clock), and two 16-bit outputs: `data` which temporarily stores the digital data from ADC, and `realdat` which holds the valid ADC conversion data after a full cycle. Internally, the module uses registers such as `cs` and `dclock` for controlling the ADC's chip select and conversion clock signals respectively. `Data` and `Realdat` registers temporarily and finally store the ADC data. It also employs an integer `i` as a counter to manage the timings of when to toggle `DCLOCK`, when to read `DOUT` into `Data`, and when to assert or deassert `CS`. Two primary always blocks drive the behavior of this module: one manipulates the control signals based on the value of `i` counter to sequence the ADC operation and data capturing, and the other is responsible for incrementing the `i` counter with every clock pulse, resetting it after it reaches the count of 2000 to restart the ADC control sequence. This structured operation ensures that the ADC is appropriately controlled, and data is fetched and stored accurately per conversion cycle.
