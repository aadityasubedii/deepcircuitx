    "module": "Module-level comment: The `ADC_Ctrl` module controls ADC operations, generating `CS` and `DCLOCK` signals based on a system clock (`clk`) and captures the ADC's digital output (`DOUT`). It uses an internal counter (`i`) to sequence control signal toggling and data capture, storing the result in a 16-bit `realdat` after a full cycle. Internal logic dictates the sequence of signal toggling and data transfer synchronized to `clk`."
