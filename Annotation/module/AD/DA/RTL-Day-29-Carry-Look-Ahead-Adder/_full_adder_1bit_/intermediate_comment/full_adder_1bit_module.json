    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'full_adder_1bit' module performs single-bit addition on three inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin', delivering a 'sum' output representing the bitwise XOR of these inputs. This module handles the basic combinational logic operation directly through an assignment statement without utilizing internal signals, streamlined for direct integration into broader adder architectures."
