Module name: full_adder_1bit. 

Module specification: The 'full_adder_1bit' module is designed to function as a single-bit full adder in digital circuits. It takes three single-bit binary inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin' and provides one single-bit binary output 'sum'. The inputs 'a' and 'b' are the two primary bits for addition, while 'cin' serves as the carry-in bit from a previous addition stage. The output 'sum' is generated through the bitwise XOR operation on the input bits, essentially summing them up without generating a carry-out bit. This module does not employ any internal signals as all operations are performed directly through combinational logic without the need for intermediate storage or processing. The entire functionality is encapsulated into a simple and clear continuous assignment statement that performs the XOR operation to compute the sum based on the input bits. This structure makes 'full_adder_1bit' ideal for use within larger multi-bit adder configurations.
