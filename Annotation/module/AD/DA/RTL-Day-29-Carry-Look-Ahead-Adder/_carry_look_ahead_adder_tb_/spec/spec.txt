Module name: carry_look_ahead_adder_tb.
Module specification: The module `carry_look_ahead_adder_tb` serves as a test bench for validating the correct functionality of a carry look-ahead adder represented by the submodule `dut`. It applies a series of test vectors to the inputs of the Device Under Test (`dut`), checks the output for correctness, and ensures that binary addition with carry propagation is handled appropriately. The input ports include `A` and `B`, which are both 4-bit wide inputs representing the binary numbers to be added, and `Cin`, a single-bit input acting as the carry-in for the addition. The output ports monitored by the test bench are `S`, a 4-bit wide output reflecting the binary sum, and `Cout`, a single-bit output carrying the carry-out value from the addition. There are no internal signals within this test bench module, as it solely focuses on stimulating and observing the `dut`. The test bench sequentially applies binary input pairs to `A` and `B`, incrementing from 4'b0000 to 4'b1111 with a 5-time unit delay between each assignment and observes `S` and `Cout` for verifying the `dut` response. The simulation concludes with the `$finish` command after testing all input combinations. This methodical approach ensures that the carry look-ahead adder functions as expected across all possible 4-bit binary input pairs.
