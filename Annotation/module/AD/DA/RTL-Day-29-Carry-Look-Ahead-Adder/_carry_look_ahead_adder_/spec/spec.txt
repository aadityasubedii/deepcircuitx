Module name: carry_look_ahead_adder. Module specification: The `carry_look_ahead_adder` module is designed to implement a 4-bit carry look-ahead adder in digital logic, offering an accelerated arithmetic operation by optimizing the carry computation process between bit additions. This module accepts two 4-bit inputs, `A` and `B`, which represent the binary numbers to be added, and a binary input `Cin` that serves as the initial carry-in for the least significant bit addition. The outputs of the module are a 4-bit sum `S` and a carry-out bit `Cout`, indicating an overflow from the most significant bit that can be chained to subsequent adder stages. Internally, the module uses intermediate carry signals (`C1`, `C2`, `C3`) to connect the outputs of four instantiated `full_adder_1bit` blocks (labelled `F0` to `F3`), which perform bit-wise addition. Additionally, it employs generate (`G`) and propagate (`P`) logic signals, each 4-bit wide, to form a carry look-ahead mechanism. The `G` signal determines if a carry is generated by the addition of bit pairs from `A` and `B`, while `P` identifies if a carry from a lower bit should be propagated to the next higher bit. The module strategically combines these internal signals using logical operations to anticipate and calculate carry outputs efficiently between stages, culminating in the computation of the final carry-out bit `Cout`. This architecture significantly enhances addition speed by reducing dependency on sequential carry propagation.
