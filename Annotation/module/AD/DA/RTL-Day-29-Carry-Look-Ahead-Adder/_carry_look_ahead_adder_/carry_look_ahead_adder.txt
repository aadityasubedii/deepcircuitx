Module-level comment: The `carry_look_ahead_adder` module implements a 4-bit carry look-ahead adder for fast binary addition. It takes two 4-bit inputs `A` and `B` and a carry-in `Cin`, producing a sum `S` and a carry-out `Cout`. Internally, it uses `full_adder_1bit` instances for bit-wise addition and employs generate (`G`) and propagate (`P`) logic to efficiently compute intermediate carries (`C1`, `C2`, `C3`) and the final carry-out using logical operations, minimizing the carry propagation delay.
