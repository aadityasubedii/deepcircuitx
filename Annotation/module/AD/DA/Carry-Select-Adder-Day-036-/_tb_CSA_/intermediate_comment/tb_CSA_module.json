    "module": "Module-level comment: The tb_CSA module is a testbench designed to validate the operation of a carry_select_adder, which executes binary addition. It stimulates the carry_select_adder (uut) with predetermined 8-bit vectors on 'a' and 'b', then checks the sum 's' and carry 'c' outputs after a 10ns delay. The testbench progresses through several input pairs to ensure the adder's correctness across a range of conditions."
