    "module": "Module-level comment: The ripple_carry_adder module implements a 4-bit addition of two binary numbers (`in0` and `in1`), outputting a 4-bit sum (`out`) and a carry out (`cout`). It chains four `full_adder` instances, each handling a bit pair addition with carry propagation, achieving a ripple effect across the bits for accurate sum and carry out."
