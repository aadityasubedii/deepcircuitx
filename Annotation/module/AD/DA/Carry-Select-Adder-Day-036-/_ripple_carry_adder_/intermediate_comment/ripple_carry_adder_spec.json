    "spec": "Module name: ripple_carry_adder. Module specification: The ripple_carry_adder is a Verilog module designed to perform addition on two 4-bit binary numbers. It consists of input ports `in0` and `in1`, each 4-bit wide, which represent the binary numbers to be added. The output includes a 4-bit port `out`, representing the sum of `in0` and `in1`, and a single-bit output `cout` that indicates an overflow carry out of the most significant bit. Internally, the module uses three intermediate wire signals: `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`, which serve as carry-outs from lower to higher significant bit additions. The module comprises four instances of the `full_adder` submodule, each responsible for adding corresponding bits from `in0` and `in1`, along with a carry-in, and producing a sum bit and a carry-out. The first `full_adder` fa0 adds the least significant bits with a default carry-in of 0, while subsequent adders fa1, fa2, and fa3 use the carry-out from the previous stage as the carry-in for the current stage, ensuring the ripple effect of carry propagation through all bit levels. This structured approach realizes a 4-bit ripple carry adder functionality effectively within the module.",

It takes two 4-bit inputs, `in0` and `in1`, and produces a 4-bit sum `out` and a carry out `cout`. Inside the module, there are four instances of a `full_adder` submodule, which are chained together. Each `full_adder` is responsible for adding a single bit from the input operands along with a carry input and producing a sum bit and a carry out. The carry out from each bit position becomes the carry in for the next higher bit position. This creates a \"ripple\" effect, where the carry information propagates through the adders from the least significant bit to the most significant bit."

Specifically:\n- `c1` is the carry out from the addition of the least significant bits (bit 0) of `in0` and `in1`. It serves as the carry in for the addition of the next bit pair (bit 1).\n- `c2` is the carry out from the addition of the bit 1 pair. It serves as the carry in for the addition of the bit 2 pair.\n- `c3` is the carry out from the addition of the bit 2 pair and serves as the carry in for the addition of the most significant bits (bit 3) in the final full_adder stage. This ensures the sequential propagation of carry from the lower to the higher bit positions, true to the behavior of a ripple carry adder."
