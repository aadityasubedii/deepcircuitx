It takes two 4-bit inputs, `in0` and `in1`, and produces a 4-bit sum `out` and a carry out `cout`. Inside the module, there are four instances of a `full_adder` submodule, which are chained together. Each `full_adder` is responsible for adding a single bit from the input operands along with a carry input and producing a sum bit and a carry out. The carry out from each bit position becomes the carry in for the next higher bit position. This creates a \"ripple\" effect, where the carry information propagates through the adders from the least significant bit to the most significant bit."

The output port `cout` is a single bit that represents the carry out of the most significant bit, which is an indication of an overflow if the sum exceeds the capacity of the module's 4-bit output."

These signals are crucial for transferring the carry outputs from one full adder stage to the subsequent stage. Specifically:\n- `c1` is the carry out from the addition of the least significant bits (bit 0) of `in0` and `in1`. It serves as the carry in for the addition of the next bit pair (bit 1).\n- `c2` is the carry out from the addition of the bit 1 pair. It serves as the carry in for the addition of the bit 2 pair.\n- `c3` is the carry out from the addition of the bit 2 pair and serves as the carry in for the addition of the most significant bits (bit 3) in the final full_adder stage. This ensures the sequential propagation of carry from the lower to the higher bit positions, true to the behavior of a ripple carry adder."
