Module name: ripple_carry_adder. Module specification: The ripple_carry_adder is a Verilog module designed to perform addition on two 4-bit binary numbers. It consists of input ports `in0` and `in1`, each 4-bit wide, which represent the binary numbers to be added. The output includes a 4-bit port `out`, representing the sum of `in0` and `in1`, and a single-bit output `cout` that indicates an overflow carry out of the most significant bit. Internally, the module uses three intermediate wire signals: `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`, which serve as carry-outs from lower to higher significant bit additions. The module comprises four instances of the `full_adder` submodule, each responsible for adding corresponding bits from `in0` and `in1`, along with a carry-in, and producing a sum bit and a carry-out. The first `full_adder` fa0 adds the least significant bits with a default carry-in of 0, while subsequent adders fa1, fa2, and fa3 use the carry-out from the previous stage as the carry-in for the current stage, ensuring the ripple effect of carry propagation through all bit levels. This structured approach realizes a 4-bit ripple carry adder functionality effectively within the module.
