    "module": "Module-level comment: The `carry_select_adder` module adds two 8-bit numbers `a` and `b`, outputting their 8-bit sum `s` and a carry-out `c`. It optimizes speed by using parallel `ripple_carry_adder` instances for upper bits and a `multiplexer_2_1` based on the carry from the lower bits. This design reduces addition delay by preempting carry propagation."
