Module name: multiplexer_2_1.
Module specification: The `multiplexer_2_1` module is a Verilog implementation of a 2-to-1 multiplexer that selects one of two WIDTH-bit wide inputs, `A0` or `A1`, to output based on a single-bit select signal, `s`. The WIDTH of the signals is parameterizable, with a default setting of 16 bits. The module's inputs are `A0` and `A1` (data inputs that can be selected for the output), and `s`, the select signal determining which input is forwarded to the output. The output `X` carries the selected input signal value. There are no internal signals in this design, as it is a straightforward combinational logic circuit without storage elements or complex internal structure. The module code contains a parameter definition for WIDTH, ports declaration, and a single continuous assignment statement using a ternary operator that implements the multiplexer's logic. This module does not contain additional blocks or sections; its entire functionality is encapsulated in one line of logical assignment.
