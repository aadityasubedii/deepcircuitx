Module-level comment: The `multiplexer_2_1` module is a 2-to-1 multiplexer that selects one of two WIDTH-bit inputs (`A0`, `A1`) based on the select signal `s`. It outputs the selected input through `X`. The selection is implemented using a conditional expression in a single assign statement, providing efficient combinational logic functionality without internal state or signals.
