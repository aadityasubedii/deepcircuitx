The output 'out' provides the sum, and 'cout' gives the carry-out. The sum (out) is calculated using the XOR operation between the three inputs, while the carry-out (cout) is derived through a combination of AND and OR operations applied to the inputs, specifically designed to output the carry generated by adding the three bits."
