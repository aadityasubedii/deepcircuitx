    "module": "Module-level comment: The `full_adder` module performs binary addition of three inputs (`in0`, `in1`, `cin`), producing a sum (`out`) and a carry-out (`cout`). Implementation uses XOR for sum calculation and a combination of AND and OR operations for carry-out, directly assigning these logical computations to output ports without internal registers or wires."
