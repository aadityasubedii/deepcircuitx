Module name: full_adder. Module specification: The `full_adder` module is a fundamental digital circuit designed for Verilog implementation, performing the arithmetic addition of three binary bits. It computes the sum and carry-out from two input bits (`in0`, `in1`) and an incoming carry bit (`cin`). The module exposes three input ports: `in0` and `in1`, which are the primary bits for the addition, and `cin`, which is the carry-in from a previous addition stage in cascaded operations. It provides two output ports: `out` for the resulting sum bit and `cout` for the carry-out bit, which is essential for higher bit additions in multi-bit adder configurations. Internally, the computation leverages basic logical operations without explicitly declared signals, directly performing operations within the output assignments. The sum `out` is obtained via an XOR operation of all input ports (`in0 ^ in1 ^ cin`), reflecting the additive combination without considering the carry. The carry-out `cout` is the result of a combination of AND and OR operations within the expressions `((in0 ^ in1) & cin)` and `(in0 & in1)`, determining the carry produced by the bit addition. The code is efficiently structured with the use of `assign` statements, assigning expressions directly to the outputs, which simplifies understanding and maintains concise module design.
