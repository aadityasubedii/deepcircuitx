Module-level comment: The `sdram_ctrl` module manages SDRAM initialization, read, and write operations synchronized by a clock (`clk`) with reset (`rst_n`). It supports burst read/write requests through input signals (`sdram_wr_req`, `sdram_rd_req`) and acknowledges these operations (`sdram_wr_ack`, `sdram_rd_ack`). Internally, it uses state machines for initialization and operational control, counters for timing management (`cnt_200us`, `cnt_refresh`, `cnt_clk`), and tracks the operation mode (`sdram_rd_wr`). The design ensures efficient SDRAM usage while adhering to timing constraints.
