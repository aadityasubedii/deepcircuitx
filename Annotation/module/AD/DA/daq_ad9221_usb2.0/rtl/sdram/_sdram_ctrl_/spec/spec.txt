Module name: sdram_ctrl. 

Module specification: The `sdram_ctrl` is a Verilog module designed to control Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (SDRAM) for operations such as initialization, and managing read and write requests. It operates based on a synchronized clock (`clk`) and utilizes an active-low reset (`rst_n`). The inputs to the module include `sdram_wr_req` and `sdram_rd_req` indicating write and read requests respectively, with corresponding output acknowledgments `sdram_wr_ack` and `sdram_rd_ack`. The module also accepts burst lengths for read (`sdram_rd_burst`) and write (`sdram_wr_burst`) operations. Once initialization is complete, indicated by the output `sdram_init_done`, the module can facilitate read or write operations. Internally, the module uses various counters such as `cnt_200us` for measuring initial delay, `cnt_refresh` for managing memory refresh intervals, and `cnt_clk` for operation timing. States for initialization (`init_state`) and operation (`work_state`) are managed through state machines, while `sdram_rd_wr` specifies the current operation mode. The implementation is divided into several parts: initialization state machine ensuring correct power-up sequence and setup, operational state machine handling the transitions between different phases of read/write requests, timing management to adhere to SDRAM specifications, and signal assignments that tie actual operation logic to state transitions. The code structure supports modular understanding of initializing and operating SDRAM using best practices for memory management and reliability.
