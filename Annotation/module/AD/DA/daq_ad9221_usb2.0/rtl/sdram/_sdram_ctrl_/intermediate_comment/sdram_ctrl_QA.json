It operates on a synchronous clock (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst_n`). The controller handles read and write requests (sdram_wr_req, sdram_rd_req) and acknowledges them (sdram_wr_ack, sdram_rd_ack). It supports burst read and write operations by managing the number of data bursts (sdram_wr_burst, sdram_rd_burst). The module includes an initialization process that sets up the SDRAM before it can be used for read/write operations, indicated by `sdram_init_done`. State machines are employed to manage initialization states (`init_state`) and operational states (`work_state`). Additionally, it tracks clock cycles for timing constraints (cnt_clk) and distinguishes between read and write operations (sdram_rd_wr). The module ensures adherence to SDRAM timing parameters such as row precharge time (`TRP_CLK`), row to column delay (`TRCD_CLK`), and refresh cycles, ensuring reliable operation of the memory."
