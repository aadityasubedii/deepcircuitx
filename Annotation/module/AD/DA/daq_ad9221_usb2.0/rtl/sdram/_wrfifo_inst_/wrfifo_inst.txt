Module-level comment: The `wrfifo` module implements a write-first FIFO queuing mechanism, ensuring data synchronization between separate read (`rdclk`) and write (`wrclk`) clock domains. It manages data input through `data` triggered by `wrreq`, and outputs data via `q` on `rdreq`. The module utilizes internal signals (`_sig` suffix) for interfacing, controls data integrity with `aclr`, and monitors status with `rdusedw` and `wrfull` to prevent data overflow.
