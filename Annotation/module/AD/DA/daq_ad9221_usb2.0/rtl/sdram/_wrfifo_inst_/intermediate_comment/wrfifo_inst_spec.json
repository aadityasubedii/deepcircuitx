    "spec": "Module name: wrfifo\n\nModule specification: \nThe `wrfifo` module implements a write-first FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer, designed to temporally store data while handling the interface between different clock domains for read (`rdclk`) and write (`wrclk`) operations. The input ports include `aclr` for asynchronously clearing the FIFO, `data` for storing into FIFO upon a `wrreq`, `rdclk` for governing read clock, `rdreq` for initiating read operations, `wrclk` for write clocking, and `wrreq` for write enablement. Output ports encompass `q` for output data, `rdusedw` indicating the count of words in the FIFO, and `wrfull` signaling when the FIFO is at maximum capacity preventing overwrites. Internal signals replicate port functionality with suffix `_sig` before linking to an instantiated FIFO module. Inside the module, primary blocks associate with managing FIFO storage, synchronizing cross-domain operations, and signaling status conditions. These would include data management (writing and reading data based on requests), synchronization blocks (ensuring operations adhere to respective clock domains), and status-reporting mechanisms (e.g., indicating FIFO full state or number of used words). Each section ensures the FIFO operates reliably and provides necessary feedback for external control logic.",

The FIFO buffer is designed for situations where data is written into the buffer at a certain rate and read at another, controlled by separate clock domains for read (`rdclk`) and write (`wrclk`) operations. The `data_sig` input is pushed into the FIFO upon an active `wrreq` (write request) signal, synchronized by the `wrclk` (write clock). Data is retrieved from the FIFO via the `q_sig` output upon an active `rdreq` (read request) signal, synchronized by the `rdclk` (read clock). The `aclr` (asynchronous clear) input forcefully clears the FIFO's contents, likely resetting its internal state. The `wrfull` signal indicates when the FIFO is full, preventing further writes to avoid data overflow, and the `rdusedw` signal probably represents the number of words currently stored in the FIFO, useful for read management purposes."

It directly influences the module's operation by clearing all stored data, resetting its internal state regardless of clock transitions.\n- `data_sig` (data input signal): Represents data being inputted to the FIFO. The FIFO stores this data when `wrreq_sig` is asserted, allowing new data entry as controlled by the write logic.\n- `rdclk_sig` (read clock signal): Serves as the clock signal for timing read operations. This signal ensures that data is read from the FIFO synchronously with the read domain's timing requirements.\n- `rdreq_sig` (read request signal): A control signal that initiates a data read from the FIFO when it is asserted. This signal controls when data is allowed to be conveyed out of the FIFO based on need.\n- `wrclk_sig` (write clock signal): Acts as the clock signal for write operations. This clock governs the timing at which data entries are managed, ensuring that data writes into the FIFO are well-synchronized.\n- `wrreq_sig` (write request signal): A control signal that, when asserted, enables the FIFO to accept data from `data_sig` based on writing requirements.\n- `q_sig` (data output signal): This is the output signal through which data stored in the FIFO is output when `rdreq_sig` is active. It carries out data from the FIFO to where it is further processed or used.\n- `rdusedw_sig` (read used words signal): Indicates how many words are currently stored within the FIFO. This signal allows for effective read operation management by providing status on space usage inside the FIFO.\n- `wrfull_sig` (write full signal): A status indicator that signals whether the FIFO is full. When asserted, this signal prevents any new write operations to the FIFO to avoid data overflow and loss. \n\nThese internal signals are critically integrated into the FIFO's function, orchestrating the controlled flow of data into and out of the FIFO, managing capacities and ensuring synchronization across different clock domains."
