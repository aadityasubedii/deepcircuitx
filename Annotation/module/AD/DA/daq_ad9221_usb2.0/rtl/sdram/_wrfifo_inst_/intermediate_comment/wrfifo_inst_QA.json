The FIFO buffer is designed for situations where data is written into the buffer at a certain rate and read at another, controlled by separate clock domains for read (`rdclk`) and write (`wrclk`) operations. The `data_sig` input is pushed into the FIFO upon an active `wrreq` (write request) signal, synchronized by the `wrclk` (write clock). Data is retrieved from the FIFO via the `q_sig` output upon an active `rdreq` (read request) signal, synchronized by the `rdclk` (read clock). The `aclr` (asynchronous clear) input forcefully clears the FIFO's contents, likely resetting its internal state. The `wrfull` signal indicates when the FIFO is full, preventing further writes to avoid data overflow, and the `rdusedw` signal probably represents the number of words currently stored in the FIFO, useful for read management purposes."

It carries out data from the FIFO to where it is further processed or used.\n- `rdusedw_sig` (read used words signal): Indicates how many words are currently stored within the FIFO. This signal allows for effective read operation management by providing status on space usage inside the FIFO.\n- `wrfull_sig` (write full signal): A status indicator that signals whether the FIFO is full. When asserted, this signal prevents any new write operations to the FIFO to avoid data overflow and loss. \n\nThese internal signals are critically integrated into the FIFO's function, orchestrating the controlled flow of data into and out of the FIFO, managing capacities and ensuring synchronization across different clock domains."
