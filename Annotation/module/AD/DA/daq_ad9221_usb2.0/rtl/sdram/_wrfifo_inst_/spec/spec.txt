Module name: wrfifo

Module specification: 
The `wrfifo` module implements a write-first FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer, designed to temporally store data while handling the interface between different clock domains for read (`rdclk`) and write (`wrclk`) operations. The input ports include `aclr` for asynchronously clearing the FIFO, `data` for storing into FIFO upon a `wrreq`, `rdclk` for governing read clock, `rdreq` for initiating read operations, `wrclk` for write clocking, and `wrreq` for write enablement. Output ports encompass `q` for output data, `rdusedw` indicating the count of words in the FIFO, and `wrfull` signaling when the FIFO is at maximum capacity preventing overwrites. Internal signals replicate port functionality with suffix `_sig` before linking to an instantiated FIFO module. Inside the module, primary blocks associate with managing FIFO storage, synchronizing cross-domain operations, and signaling status conditions. These would include data management (writing and reading data based on requests), synchronization blocks (ensuring operations adhere to respective clock domains), and status-reporting mechanisms (e.g., indicating FIFO full state or number of used words). Each section ensures the FIFO operates reliably and provides necessary feedback for external control logic.
