It operates under a clock, `clk`, and an active low reset `rst_n`.\n\nThe module processes input addresses for read (`sys_rdaddr`) and write (`sys_wraddr`) operations, along with the current burst lengths for reads (`sdram_rd_burst`) and writes (`sdram_wr_burst`). It uses these inputs, along with the initialization state (`init_state`), working state (`work_state`), and a counter (`cnt_clk`) to determine the correct SDRAM command to issue.\n\nThe module outputs control signals (`sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`) which together define the SDRAM command to be executed. Additionally, it outputs the bank address (`sdram_ba`) and the memory address (`sdram_addr`) that will be used with the command.\n\nDuring each clock cycle, the module selects the proper command and address values based on the current state of the initialization sequence or the memory operation. For instance, during initialization, the module issues specific commands like NOP, Precharge, Auto-Refresh, etc., at appropriate intervals. Once initialization is done, the module interprets the working state to issue the commands necessary for active read/write operations like activating a row, reading or writing data, or precharging the row.\n\nIn summary, the sdram_cmd module manages the low-level signaling required to control an SDRAM device during both the initialization phase and when performing regular memory access operations."
