Module-level comment: The 'sdram_cmd' module generates control signals for SDRAM operations. It processes initialization and memory access commands based on input states, addresses, and counters. The module uses internal logic to set SDRAM command signals and addresses, guided by the clock and reset inputs, managing the command timing and sequence for efficient memory interaction. This module directly interfaces with the SDRAM, handling commands like NOP, Active, Read, Write, and others as per operational requirements.
