Module name: sdram_cmd. 
Module specification: The sdram_cmd module is designed to interface with Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), orchestrating the signal timing and command sequencing for initialization and read/write operations. The module synchronizes its operations to a clock input (`clk`) while being capable of resetting (`rst_n`). It takes in system read (`sys_rdaddr`) and write (`sys_wraddr`) addresses along with the burst lengths for reads (`sdram_rd_burst`) and writes (`sdram_wr_burst`). It also operates based on the SDRAM initialization state (`init_state`), work state (`work_state`), a counter (`cnt_clk`), and a read/write select signal (`sdram_rd_wr`). 

The outputs include SDRAM command signals (`sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`) and the selected bank address (`sdram_ba`) and address (`sdram_addr`) for the memory operations. Internal signals like `sdram_cmd_r`, a registered 5-bit command signal, translate the module state to the appropriate command encoded from predefined constants in "sdram_para.v". Another signal, `sys_addr`, determines the current address for an operation. 

The code functions under an always block triggered on rising clock edges or falling reset (`rst_n`) edges. It processes initialization commands like NOPs, Active, Precharge, and Auto-Refresh during the initial phase and translates work state into memory commands during regular operation, aligning commands with system addresses for target memory operations. Edge cases with conditional logic handle burst terminations for reads and writes. Overall, the sdram_cmd module effectively manages the necessary SDRAM control logic for varying stages of memory interaction, ensuring accurate command timing and memory addressing based on its input states and signals.
