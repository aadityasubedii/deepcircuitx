Module-level comment: The 'wrfifo' module serves as a dual-clock FIFO buffer handling different write and read clock domains. It incorporates 'dcfifo_component' to manage data buffering, featuring asynchronous clear, full indicators, and read-write requests. Internal wiring conveys status and data outputs to module ports ensuring reliable inter-clock domain data transfers.
