Module name: wrfifo.
Module specification: The 'wrfifo' module is a dual-clock FIFO buffer designed to facilitate data communication between write and read operations occurring at different clock domains. The module features input ports such as 'aclr' for asynchronously resetting the FIFO, 'data' which is a 16-bit input bus for data to be written to the FIFO, 'rdclk' and 'wrclk' as read and write clock inputs respectively, and 'rdreq' and 'wrreq' as read and write request signals. Output ports include 'q', which is a 16-bit data output bus, 'rdusedw' which is a 10-bit output showing the number of words available for reading, and 'wrfull' to indicate whether the FIFO is full. Internal signals, such as 'sub_wire0', 'sub_wire1', and 'sub_wire2', facilitate the connection between the FIFO logic implemented in the 'dcfifo_component' and the module's ports, handling full signal, data output, and read words count respectively. The Verilog code is structured into signal declarations, a instantiation of the 'dcfifo_component' with necessary parameter settings like device type, FIFO depth, data width, and the connection of internal wires to output ports. The module is well-suited for applications involving different clock domain operations where seamless and reliable data transfer is critical.
