    "module": "Module-level comment: The SDRAM_Controller module interfaces with SDRAM, managing operations such as initialization, read, write, and refresh utilizing a state machine derived from specified macros (`W_IDLE`, `W_ACTIVE`, etc.). It synchronously processes commands (`CMD_` series), addressing, and data inputs/outputs, handling necessary timing and state transitions based on internal counters and signal flags, ensuring compliance with SDRAM timing requirements."
