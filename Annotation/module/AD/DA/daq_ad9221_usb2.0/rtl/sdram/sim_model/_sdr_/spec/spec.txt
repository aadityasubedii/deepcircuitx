Module name: sdr. Module specification: The sdr module represents a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) device, implementing the functionality of an SDRAM chip including command decoding, address handling, data read/write operations, and timing checks. It supports various SDRAM operations such as activate, read, write, precharge, and refresh commands, as well as features like burst mode, auto-precharge, and different burst lengths. The module has input ports for clock (Clk), clock enable (Cke), chip select (Cs_n), row address strobe (Ras_n), column address strobe (Cas_n), write enable (We_n), address (Addr), bank address (Ba), and data mask (Dqm). It uses a bidirectional data bus (Dq) for input and output. Internally, the module employs numerous signals and registers to
