    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) device. It supports various SDRAM operations including activate, read, write, precharge, and refresh commands. The module decodes incoming commands, manages address handling, and controls data read/write operations. It implements features such as burst mode, auto-precharge, and different burst lengths. The module also performs timing checks to ensure proper SDRAM operation and provides debug output for monitoring behavior during simulation. Internal registers and signals are used to track bank states, row/column addresses, and timing parameters."
