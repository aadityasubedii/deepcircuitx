Module name: `sdram_controller`.

Module specification: The `sdram_controller` is a Verilog module that interfaces with Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) to manage initialization, read, and write operations on behalf of a host system. It uses a clock signal (`clk`) to time its operations and an active-low reset input (`rst_n`) for initializing the module to a known state. The controller accepts read (`sdram_rd_req`) and write (`sdram_wr_req`) requests, along with corresponding addresses (`sdram_wr_addr`, `sdram_rd_addr`) and burst lengths (`sdram_wr_burst`, `sdram_rd_burst`). Data to be written is delivered via a 16-bit data input bus (`sdram_din`) and data read from SDRAM is output on a 16-bit data output bus (`sdram_dout`). Acknowledgment signals (`sdram_wr_ack`, `sdram_rd_ack`) are used to confirm the acceptance of read and write requests, and `sdram_init_done` indicates when the SDRAM initialization sequence is complete.

The controller generates several control and address signals for the SDRAM: clock enable (`sdram_cke`), chip select (`sdram_cs_n`), row address strobe (`sdram_ras_n`), column address strobe (`sdram_cas_n`), write enable (`sdram_we_n`), bank address (`sdram_ba`), and address (`sdram_addr`). The bidirectional data I/O bus (`sdram_data`) serves as the pathway for both input during read and output during write operations to the SDRAM.

Internally, the module uses four key signals: `init_state` to track the SDRAM initialization process states, `work_state` to monitor the operational state of the controller, `cnt_clk` as a cycle counter for timing, and `sdram_rd_wr` as a flag for indicating read or write operations. The module consists of three instantiated submodules. Firstly, `sdram_ctrl` presumably manages the initiation and acknowledgment of read and write requests, as well as indicating the completion of initialization. Second, `sdram_cmd` handles the generation of necessary command and address signals based on the operation phase, controlled by the state machines and counters. Lastly, `sdram_data` manages the data flow to and from the SDRAM via the data I/O bus, interfacing with the system's data input and output buses. Together, these submodules enable the SDRAM to be properly controlled and interfaced with a larger digital system.
