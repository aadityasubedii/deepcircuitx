    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_controller` module interfaces with SDRAM to handle initialization, reads, and writes. It features inputs for clock, reset, data, and control signals and outputs for acknowledgments and data. Internally, it comprises three submodules (`sdram_ctrl`, `sdram_cmd`, `sdram_data`) to manage control signals, address generation, and data handling between the SDRAM and system, utilizing state machines and cycle counters to orchestrate operations effectively."
