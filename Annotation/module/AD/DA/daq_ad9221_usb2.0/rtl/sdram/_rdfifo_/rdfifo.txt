Module-level comment: The "rdfifo" module implements a dual clock FIFO buffer, managing data transfers across different clock domains using the `dcfifo_component`. It supports asynchronous clearing, read/write requests, and monitors buffer status through `aclr`, `rdreq`, `wrreq`, and status outputs. Internal wiring connects the FIFO component's outputs to module ports, ensuring synchronized, reliable data flow and buffer management.
