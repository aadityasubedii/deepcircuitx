It interfaces with read and write operations under separate clock domains, supporting synchronization between the two. The module takes in data along with write requests (`wrreq`) under a write clock (`wrclk`) and outputs data upon read requests (`rdreq`) under a read clock (`rdclk`). It also handles asynchronous clear signals (`aclr`). Additionally, the module outputs the status flags `rdempty` indicating if the read buffer is empty, and `wrusedw` showing the count of used slots in the write buffer. These functionalities are essential for managing data flow between circuits operating at different frequencies or phases, ensuring reliable data transfer without loss or corruption."

It is used to reset the FIFO, clearing all contents and resetting its state. This input is active when low.\n- data: 16-bit data input port. This is the data to be written into the FIFO when there is a write request (`wrreq`).\n- rdclk: Read clock input. This clock is used for all read operations from the FIFO.\n- rdreq: Read request input. When asserted, it indicates a request to read data from the FIFO on the rising edge of `rdclk`.\n- wrclk: Write clock input. This clock is used for all write operations to the FIFO.\n- wrreq: Write request input. When asserted, it signals that new data on the `data` input should be written into the FIFO on the rising edge of `wrclk`.\n\nOutput ports: q, rdempty, wrusedw.\nExplanation:\n- q: 16-bit data output port. This outputs the data from FIFO when a read request (`rdreq`) is made and the FIFO is not empty.\n- rdempty: Read empty flag output. This signal is high when the FIFO is empty, indicating that there are no data elements to read.\n- wrusedw: Write used words count output. This 10-bit output provides the count of how many slots in the FIFO are currently being used (i.e., how many data elements are stored and awaiting to be read). This helps in understanding the buffer usage and avoiding overflow conditions."

It captures the data being read from the FIFO to be outputted when a read request is made.\n- sub_wire1: A single-bit wire that connects the `rdempty` output of the `dcfifo_component` to the module's `rdempty` output port. It signals whether the FIFO is empty, playing a crucial role in indicating to the module's user that there are no more data elements available for reading.\n- sub_wire2: A 10-bit wire that links the `wrusedw` output of the `dcfifo_component` to the module's `wrusedw` output port. This signal provides information about the number of slots currently used within the FIFO, which is vital for managing the FIFO's capacity and preventing data overflows or underflows by monitoring the fill level."
