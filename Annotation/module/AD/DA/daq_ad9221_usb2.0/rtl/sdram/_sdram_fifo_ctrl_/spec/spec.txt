Module name: sdram_fifo_ctrl. 
Module specification:
The sdram_fifo_ctrl is a Verilog module designed to interface with Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (SDRAM) using FIFO buffers, facilitating read and write operations. It handles data transfer synchronization between the system FIFOs and the SDRAM, ensuring proper sequencing and timing aligned with SDRAM protocols. Input ports include various clocks (clk_ref, clk_write, clk_read) for controlling different aspects of timing, reset signal (rst_n) for initializing the module, control signals for write (wrf_wrreq, wr_min_addr, wr_max_addr, wr_length, wr_load) and read (rdf_rdreq, rd_min_addr, rd_max_addr, rd_length, rd_load) operations, status signals from the SDRAM (sdram_read_valid, sdram_init_done, sdram_wr_ack, sdram_rd_ack), and data inputs (wrf_din, sdram_dout). Output ports convey FIFO status (wrf_full, rdf_empty), data routing (rdf_dout, sdram_din), and control requests and addresses to the SDRAM (sdram_wr_req, sdram_wr_addr, sdram_rd_req, sdram_rd_addr).

Internal signals like `wr_ack_r1`, `wr_ack_r2`, `rd_ack_r1`, and `rd_ack_r2` serve as registers to detect edges of acknowledgment signals from the SDRAM. Flags such as `write_done_flag` and `read_done_flag` indicate the completion of write and read operations, respectively. `wr_load_r1`, `wr_load_r2`, `rd_load_r1`, `rd_load_r2`, and associated flags (`wr_load_flag`, `rd_load_flag`) detect the loading of new base addresses for read/write operations. Synchronization registers `read_valid_r1`, `read_valid_r2` ensure that the read valid signal from SDRAM is synchronized with the system clock. FIFO usage signals (`wrf_use`, `rdf_use`) track the occupancy level within FIFOs.

The module organizes code into blocks that handle edge detection (for flags), address counters, and control request generation based on FIFO states and external conditions. Two instantiated FIFO modules (`u_wrfifo`, `u_rdfifo`) manage writing and reading data to and from the SDRAM. The module ensures that the FIFO buffers and the SDRAM controller are synchronized by updating internal states and signals based on the control logic, SDRAM initialization status, and FIFO usage conditions. This overview concisely encapsulates the design and operational intricacies of the sdram_fifo_ctrl module.
