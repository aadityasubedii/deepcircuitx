It handles initializing read and write requests to the SDRAM based on defined address ranges and lengths, and synchronizes these operations with external read and write requests coming into the module. The module ensures data can be written to or read from the SDRAM safely and efficiently by monitoring address boundaries, managing request signals, and leveraging FIFO buffers to store data temporarily during read and write processes. The use of flags and registers orchestrates the timing and sequence of these operations, adhering to SDRAM communication protocols, and ensuring data integrity during transfers."
