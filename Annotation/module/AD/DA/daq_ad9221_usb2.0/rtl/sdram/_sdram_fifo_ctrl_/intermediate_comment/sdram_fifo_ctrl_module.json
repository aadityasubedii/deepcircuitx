    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sdram_fifo_ctrl` module interfaces with SDRAM via FIFO buffers to manage read and write operations. It handles data synchronization, uses internal registers for edge detection and flag generation, and controls SDRAM addresses. FIFO modules manage data handling, and control signals regulate request initiation based on buffer states and SDRAM readiness, ensuring efficient and error-free memory operations."
