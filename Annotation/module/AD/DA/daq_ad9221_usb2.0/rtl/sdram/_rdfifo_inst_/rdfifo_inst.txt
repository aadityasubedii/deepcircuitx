Module-level comment: The 'rdfifo_inst' module implements a synchronous FIFO buffer for data storage and retrieval between asynchronous producer and consumer clock domains. It manages read/write operations via aclr, rdclk/wrclk, and rdreq/wrreq signals, with internal signals ensuring seamless data flow and status reporting through q, rdempty, and wrusedw outputs.
