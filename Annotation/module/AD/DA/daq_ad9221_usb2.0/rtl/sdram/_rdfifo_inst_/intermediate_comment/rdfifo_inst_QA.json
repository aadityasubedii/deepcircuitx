It manages data flow between producers and consumers where the data writing and reading operations occur at potentially different clock speeds or phases. This instance is configured with signals for asynchronous clear, data handling, clock signals for reading and writing, read and write requests, output data signal, an indicator if the read operation is empty, and a signal indicating the usage status of the write buffer. This setup suggests the module's purpose is for buffered, synchronized data transfer or storage in digital design applications, ensuring data integrity when operating across different clock domains."

It represents the data items that are to be stored in the FIFO.\n- **rdclk (read clock)**: The clock signal used for the read operations. It governs the timing of data extraction from the FIFO.\n- **rdreq (read request)**: A control signal indicating a request to read data from the FIFO. When asserted, it triggers the FIFO to present data at its output.\n- **wrclk (write clock)**: The clock signal used for the write operations. It governs the timing of data entry into the FIFO.\n- **wrreq (write request)**: A control signal indicating a request to write data into the FIFO. When asserted, data on the 'data' port is written into the FIFO.\n\nOutput ports: q, rdempty, wrusedw.\nExplanation:\n- **q (data output)**: This port outputs the data from the FIFO. It presents the data at the head of the FIFO queue when a read operation is successfully performed.\n- **rdempty (read empty)**: This signal indicates whether the FIFO is empty. If true, it means there are no data items to read from the FIFO.\n- **wrusedw (write used words)**: This signal provides the count of the data items currently stored in the FIFO. It helps in understanding how full the FIFO is, which can be crucial for managing overflow conditions or determining how much additional data can be written into the FIFO."

It carries the data that is to be stored within the FIFO memory.\n- **rdclk_sig (read clock signal)**: Employed as the timing pulse for read operations, this clock signal ensures that read operations are carried out in sync with system requirements or specified timing.\n- **rdreq_sig (read request signal)**: This signal initiates the read process from the FIFO. When activated, it signals the FIFO to allow data to be read from its storage and output it via the q signal.\n- **wrclk_sig (write clock signal)**: Similar to the read clock, this signal synchronizes write operations to the FIFO, ensuring data entries are conducted at consistent intervals or specified timings.\n- **wrreq_sig (write request signal)**: This control signal triggers writing data to the FIFO. When asserted, it enables data present on the data_sig to be stored inside the FIFO.\n- **q_sig (output data signal)**: This outputs data from FIFO. It provides the data at the FIFO's output port during read operations.\n- **rdempty_sig (read empty signal)**: Acts as an indicator that shows whether the FIFO buffer is empty. When asserted, it tells the surrounding system that there are no data available to read.\n- **wrusedw_sig (write used words signal)**: Provides constant feedback on the number of words (data items) currently stored in the FIFO. This aids in managing the memory utilisation efficiently, and ensures that the FIFO does not overflow."
