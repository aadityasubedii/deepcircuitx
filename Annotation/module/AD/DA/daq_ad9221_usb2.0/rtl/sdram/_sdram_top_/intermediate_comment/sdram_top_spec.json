    "spec": "Module name: sdram_top.\nModule specification: The 'sdram_top' module is an interface designed for SDRAM operations, managing read and write functionalities, the initialization process, and data transfers between SDRAM and other system components. It ensures efficient data handling by coordinating with submodules 'sdram_fifo_ctrl' and 'sdram_controller'. Inputs include various clocks (`ref_clk`, `out_clk`, `wr_clk`, `rd_clk`), data (`wr_data`), control signals (`rst_n`, `wr_en`, `wr_load`, `rd_en`, `rd_load`, `sdram_read_valid`), as well as addresses and lengths for reading and writing operations (`wr_min_addr`, `wr_max_addr`, `wr_len`, `rd_min_addr`, `rd_max_addr`, `rd_len`). Outputs comprise status flags (`wrf_full`, `rdf_empty`, `sdram_init_done`), read data (`rd_data`), SDRAM control signals (`sdram_clk`, `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`, `sdram_ba`, `sdram_addr`, `sdram_dqm`), and bidirectional data lines (`sdram_data`). Internal signals such as `sdram_wr_req`, `sdram_wr_ack`, `sdram_wr_addr`, `sdram_din`, `sdram_rd_req`, `sdram_rd_ack`, `sdram_rd_addr`, and `sdram_dout` facilitate the command and data flow between the FIFO control and the SDRAM controller. The code is structured into two main blocks: 'sdram_fifo_ctrl', controlling the FIFO buffers and handling read and write requests; and 'sdram_controller', directly controlling SDRAM operations based on requests and acknowledgments from the FIFO control. Each block synchronizes its operations with the reference clock, handles proper data flow, and ensures that initialization and active operations can proceed without conflicts.",

It ensures efficient data handling by coordinating with submodules 'sdram_fifo_ctrl' and 'sdram_controller'. Inputs include various clocks (`ref_clk`, `out_clk`, `wr_clk`, `rd_clk`), data (`wr_data`), control signals (`rst_n`, `wr_en`, `wr_load`, `rd_en`, `rd_load`, `sdram_read_valid`), as well as addresses and lengths for reading and writing operations (`wr_min_addr`, `wr_max_addr`, `wr_len`, `rd_min_addr`, `rd_max_addr`, `rd_len`). Outputs comprise status flags (`wrf_full`, `rdf_empty`, `sdram_init_done`), read data (`rd_data`), SDRAM control signals (`sdram_clk`, `sdram_cke`, `sdram_cs_n`, `sdram_ras_n`, `sdram_cas_n`, `sdram_we_n`, `sdram_ba`, `sdram_addr`, `sdram_dqm`), and bidirectional data lines (`sdram_data`). Internal signals such as `sdram_wr_req`, `sdram_wr_ack`, `sdram_wr_addr`, `sdram_din`, `sdram_rd_req`, `sdram_rd_ack`, `sdram_rd_addr`, and `sdram_dout` facilitate the command and data flow between the FIFO control and the SDRAM controller. The code is structured into two main blocks: 'sdram_fifo_ctrl', controlling the FIFO buffers and handling read and write requests; and 'sdram_controller', directly controlling SDRAM operations based on requests and acknowledgments from the FIFO control. Each block synchronizes its operations with the reference clock, handles proper data flow, and ensures that initialization and active operations can proceed without conflicts."
