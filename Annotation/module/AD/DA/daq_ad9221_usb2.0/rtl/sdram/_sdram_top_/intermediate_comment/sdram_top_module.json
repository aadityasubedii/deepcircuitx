    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'sdram_top' module interfaces with SDRAM, handling read/write operations and initialization. It utilizes 'sdram_fifo_ctrl' for buffering and managing data flow, and 'sdram_controller' for direct SDRAM command execution. Inputs include clocks, data, control signals, and address ranges, with outputs for status, control signals, and read data. Internal signals coordinate between FIFO control and SDRAM control, ensuring efficient data handling and synchronization."
