    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"sdram_data\" module manages data exchange between a system and SDRAM by directing a 16-bit bidirectional data bus, using internal registers and control logic. On write operations defined by `work_state`, it drives the SDRAM bus with input data. During read operations, it absorbs data from SDRAM into an output register. The behavior is clock-synchronized and resettable."
