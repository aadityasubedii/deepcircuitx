    "module": "Module-level comment: The `pll_adc` module implements a phase-locked loop for clock generation, utilizing the `altpll` component from Altera to output four different clocks (`c0`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`) derived from a single input (`inclk0`). It features asynchronous reset (`areset`), and outputs a `locked` signal indicating PLL stability. Configuration parameters set in the `altpll` instantiation enable various clock properties adjustments, catering to specific circuit requirements."
