Module name: pll_adc.

Module specification: The `pll_adc` module is a phase-locked loop (PLL) implementation tailored for clock generation in analog-to-digital converter systems or other digital circuits requiring precise clock management. It utilizes the `altpll` component, a PLL megafunction from Altera (Intel), to derive multiple synchronized output clocks from a single reference input clock.

The module includes two input ports: `areset`, an asynchronous reset to clear the PLL's state, and `inclk0`, the reference clock input. The outputs are four clock signals `c0`, `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`, each with potentially different frequency, phase, and duty cycle characteristics. Additionally, the `locked` output indicates when the PLL has achieved stable frequency lock.

Within the module, internal signals such as `sub_wire0` (a 5-bit bus), `sub_wire3`, and `sub_wire7` (a 2-bit bus), along with others like `sub_wire4`, `sub_wire5`, `sub_wire1`, `sub_wire2`, and `sub_wire6`, perform interconnections and signal assignments essential for PLL operation. `sub_wire0` connects the megafunction's clock outputs to the module's output ports. `sub_wire3` carries the lock status, and `sub_wire7` feeds the input clock to the `altpll` component.

The Verilog code is structured into declarations of I/O ports and internal wires, followed by instantiation of the `altpll` component with specific parameter configurations for the desired output clock characteristics and operating mode. Parameters define the behavior and properties of individual output clocks and establish the PLL configuration for the intended device family. The module is carefully parameterized to allow flexibility and reusability in various applications that demand precision clocking derived from the primary clock source `inclk0`.
