Module name: async_fifo.
Module specification: The async_fifo is a Verilog module designed as an asynchronous FIFO buffer tasked with the storage and management of data between different clock domains. It is equipped with a 16-bit input data bus (`data`) which receives the data to be stored in the FIFO. The `rdclk` and `wrclk` serve as the read and write clock inputs, respectively, dictating the timing of their corresponding operations. `rdreq` and `wrreq` are control signals indicating the intent to perform read and write actions. For outputs, the module features an 8-bit data bus (`q`) that transfers the FIFOâ€™s output data, complemented by the `rdempty` and `wrfull` flags that signal FIFO status. As the internal implementation is not provided, internal signals, if any, are not documented in the specification. The code hints at a structure optimized for handling asynchronous read and write procedures, likely with internal buffering mechanisms to ensure data integrity across unaligned clocks, but the details of these internal blocks and their functionalities would need further elaboration based on actual code content inside the module.
