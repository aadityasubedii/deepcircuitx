Module-level comment: The `async_fifo` module serves as an asynchronous FIFO buffer, enabling data interchange between different clock domains. Inputs include a 16-bit data bus and separate read/write clock and request signals, managing data flow. Outputs are an 8-bit data bus and status flags indicating empty or full states. Internal implementation specifics, like buffering and control logic, are vital but not detailed in the available code.
