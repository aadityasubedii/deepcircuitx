    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"pll_adc\" module is a phase-locked loop construct useful for generating phase-aligned clock signals relative to a reference clock, with an added asynchronous reset feature. It interfaces with an external ADC system requiring precise timing. This module lists the I/O ports and connects internal PLL circuitry (not shown) to produce multiple clock outputs and a lock status indicator, reliant on the Altera FPGA synthesis environment."
