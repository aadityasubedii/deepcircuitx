However, by conventional naming conventions in Verilog, \"pll_adc\" suggests that the module may be associated with a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) system.

Explanation: This signal is used to asynchronously reset the internal state of the module to a known state, regardless of the clock signal.\n- inclk0: Input clock. Explanation: This is the primary clock input to the PLL. It is the reference clock that the PLL will lock onto and generate the phase-aligned output clocks.\n\nOutput ports:\n- c0: Clock output 0.
