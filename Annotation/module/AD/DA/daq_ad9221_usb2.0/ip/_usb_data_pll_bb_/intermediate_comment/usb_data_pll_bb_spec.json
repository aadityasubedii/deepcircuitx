    "spec": "Module name: usb_data_pll.\n\nModule specification: The 'usb_data_pll' is a Verilog module intended for phase-locked loop (PLL) operations associated with USB data handling. It is designed to receive an input clock signal and produce a modified clock signal as an output, implying its potential utility in frequency synthesis or clock management for USB-related applications. The module has a single input port named 'inclk0', serving as the primary clock input that is expected to be processed within the PLL's logic to meet specific USB data requirements. The corresponding output port is 'c0', which delivers the PLL-modified clock signal intended for use elsewhere in the system, such as synchronizing data transfers at the appropriate frequency and phase. As the provided code does not specify any internal signals or describe additional module blocks, it is unclear how 'inclk0' is transformed into 'c0', and the absence of internal logic or further code prevents a deeper explanation. There are no delineated blocks or sections in the code snippet provided, hence no overview of different code functionalities or operations can be given. The complete inner workings of the module would need to be defined with additional code and commentary for a full specification.",
