Module-level comment: The `usb_data_pll` module is an instantiation of a USB-specific PLL, which stabilizes and aligns the clock frequency for USB data transactions. It accepts a reference clock (`inclk0_sig`) and generates a processed output clock (`c0_sig`). The internal PLL architecture, not shown here, synthesizes the output based on the input frequency.
