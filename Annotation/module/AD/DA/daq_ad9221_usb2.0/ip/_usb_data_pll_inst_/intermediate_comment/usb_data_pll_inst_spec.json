    "spec": "Module name: usb_data_pll. Module specification: The `usb_data_pll` module is a phase-locked loop (PLL) specifically designed for handling USB data operations. This module functions by receiving an input clock signal through its input port `inclk0 (inclk0_sig)`, which serves as the reference frequency for the PLL operations. The PLL processes this input and outputs a modified clock signal through its output port `c0 (c0_sig)`. This output is crucial for timing USB data transactions, ensuring alignment and stability in communications. The Verilog code provided defines only the instantiation of this module (`usb_data_pll_inst`), showing how it interfaces with the signals `inclk0_sig` and `c0_sig`. Internal details of the module, including any internal signals or additional blocks within the module, are not exposed in the snippet, indicating that the snippet focuses purely on the connection aspects rather than the internal architecture of the PLL. This module is utilized in hardware designs where precise clock generation and frequency management for USB interfaces are required.",
