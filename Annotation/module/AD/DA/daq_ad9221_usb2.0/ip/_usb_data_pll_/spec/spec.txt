Module name: usb_data_pll.
Module specification: The 'usb_data_pll' is a Verilog module specifically designed to function as a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for USB data communication, utilizing an Altera 'altpll' component optimized for Cyclone IV E FPGAs. The module takes a single input clock 'inclk0' which acts as the reference clock for the PLL. The PLL generates a stable clock output termed 'c0', that maintains the frequency of the input clock based on the configuration parameters set. Internally, the module employs several signals: 'sub_wire0', a 5-bit wire carrying the potential multiple clock outputs from the 'altpll'; 'sub_wire4', a constant representing unused optional functionality; 'sub_wire1', routing the actual used clock output to 'c0'; and 'sub_wire2' and 'sub_wire3' which collectively forward the input clock to the 'altpll'. The code block comprising the 'altpll_component' instance and its accompanying 'defparam' assignments details the configuration of the PLL, such as the bandwidth, division and multiplication factors, phase shift, and operational modes, with most of the optional features set to unused. This setup ensures that the PLL output is synchronized and suitable for USB data communication applications without additional complexities.
