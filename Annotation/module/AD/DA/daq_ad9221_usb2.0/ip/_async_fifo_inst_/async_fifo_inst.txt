Module-level comment: The `async_fifo` module implements an asynchronous FIFO buffer, facilitating data transfer across different clock domains with separate read (`rdclk`) and write (`wrclk`) clocks. It stores incoming data (`data`) upon a write request (`wrreq`) and outputs data (`q`) on a read request (`rdreq`). Status signals (`rdempty`, `wrfull`) prevent invalid read/write operations. Internally, the module utilizes pointers, storage array, and control logic to manage data integrity and FIFO states.
