This buffer allows for data to be written (pushed) and read (popped) under the control of different clock domains, indicated by separate read and write clock signals (`rdclk` and `wrclk`). The `data_sig` is the input data written into the FIFO when `wrreq` (write request) is active, and `q_sig` outputs the data from the FIFO when `rdreq` (read request) is active. The module also includes flags `rdempty_sig` indicating if the FIFO is empty and `wrfull_sig` signaling if the FIFO is full, to prevent overreading or overwriting, thus maintaining data integrity across asynchronous clock domains."
