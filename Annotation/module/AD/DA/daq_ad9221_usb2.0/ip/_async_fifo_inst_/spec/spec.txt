Module name: async_fifo. 

Module specification: The `async_fifo` module represents an asynchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer designed in Verilog for handling data transfers across different clock domains. The module operates with separate clocks for reading (`rdclk`) and writing (`wrclk`) processes, enhancing its utility in systems with asynchronous domain interactions. Input ports include `data` for incoming data to be stored in the FIFO when `wrreq` (write request) is active, `rdclk` to synchronize read operations, `rdreq` for initiating a read when active, `wrclk` for write synchronization, and `wrreq` for triggering writes. The output ports comprise `q`, which outputs the data from the FIFO on an active `rdreq`, `rdempty` to indicate the buffer's empty status, and `wrfull` to show if the FIFO is full, preventing data corruption from overwrites or unnecessary reads. Internally, the module likely leverages read and write pointers, a storage array for the data, and control logic to manage FIFO states and operations efficiently, although specific details of these signals and structures would rely on the internal module definition not provided here. In terms of code organization, the `async_fifo` module would include blocks for handling read and write operations effectively in their respective clock domains, along with logic for status flag management and data integrity safeguards.
