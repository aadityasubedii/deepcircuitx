    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pll_adc' module generates phase-aligned clock signals for ADC systems using a PLL mechanism. It accepts 'areset' for asynchronous reset and 'inclk0' as a reference clock, outputting multiple clocks ('c0' to 'c3') and a 'locked' status. It is instantiated with internal signals that mirror the input and output ports, ensuring modular and reusable design for stable, synchronized clock outputs in high-precision applications."
