Module name: pll_adc. Module specification: The 'pll_adc' module is designed for generating synchronized clock outputs for use with ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) systems, employing a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to align the phase and frequency of its output clocks with a given input clock. Input ports include 'areset', an asynchronous reset that initializes the internal states of the PLL during power-up or error conditions, and 'inclk0', the reference clock signal the PLL locks onto. Output ports comprise 'c0', 'c1', 'c2', and 'c3', which are the PLL-generated clock signals possibly varying in frequency and phase, along with 'locked', a status signal reflecting the PLL's lock condition. Internal signals 'areset_sig' and 'inclk0_sig' mirror the input ports serving similar reset and reference clock functions, while 'c0_sig', 'c1_sig', 'c2_sig', 'c3_sig', and 'locked_sig' correspond to their respective output ports. The PLL implementation details are abstracted in this instantiation; however, the overall function within the system is to provide stable and synchronized clock outputs essential for ADC operations and other system components requiring precise timing. The code block, as provided, shows the instantiation of the 'pll_adc' module with connections to its internal signals, suggesting a modular design approach that enables reuse and clarity in higher-level system architecture.
