Module name: async_fifo. Module specification: The 'async_fifo' module is designed to enable an asynchronous First In First Out (FIFO) buffer operation using a dual-clock approach to handle data of mixed-widths. The functionality revolves around data being written at a different rate and width relative to its reading. Input ports include `data[15:0]` for a 16-bit data bus input, `rdclk` and `wrclk` for independent read and write clock signals, and `rdreq` and `wrreq` for initiating read and write operations, respectively. The output ports consist of `q[7:0]`, an 8-bit data bus output, `rdempty` signaling read emptiness, and `wrfull` indicating write fullness. Internal signals such as `sub_wire0`, `sub_wire1[7:0]`, and `sub_wire2` are utilized to connect the outputs from the dual-clock FIFO component (`dcfifo_mixed_widths_component`) to the respective external module outputs, managing the synchronization and transport of status flags and data outputs. The main Verilog blocks in the code relate to interfacing with the `dcfifo_mixed_widths_component`, which is configured for specifics like device family, word size, and FIFO depth by setting relevant parameters. This component primarily handles the asynchronous read and write logic, data buffering, and status signaling under different clock domains, ensuring reliable data transfer within the specified operational constraints.
