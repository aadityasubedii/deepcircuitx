    "spec": "Module name: async_fifo. Module specification: The 'async_fifo' module is designed to enable an asynchronous First In First Out (FIFO) buffer operation using a dual-clock approach to handle data of mixed-widths. The functionality revolves around data being written at a different rate and width relative to its reading. Input ports include `data[15:0]` for a 16-bit data bus input, `rdclk` and `wrclk` for independent read and write clock signals, and `rdreq` and `wrreq` for initiating read and write operations, respectively. The output ports consist of `q[7:0]`, an 8-bit data bus output, `rdempty` signaling read emptiness, and `wrfull` indicating write fullness. Internal signals such as `sub_wire0`, `sub_wire1[7:0]`, and `sub_wire2` are utilized to connect the outputs from the dual-clock FIFO component (`dcfifo_mixed_widths_component`) to the respective external module outputs, managing the synchronization and transport of status flags and data outputs. The main Verilog blocks in the code relate to interfacing with the `dcfifo_mixed_widths_component`, which is configured for specifics like device family, word size, and FIFO depth by setting relevant parameters. This component primarily handles the asynchronous read and write logic, data buffering, and status signaling under different clock domains, ensuring reliable data transfer within the specified operational constraints.",

It contains the data to be stored in the FIFO each time a write operation is initiated.\n- `rdclk` is the clock signal used for reading operations. It is independent from the write clock to allow asynchronous operation.\n- `rdreq` signifies a request to read the next available data from the FIFO. If the FIFO is not empty and a read request is asserted, data will be read on the next read clock edge.\n- `wrclk` is the clock signal used for writing operations, allowing the FIFO to operate asynchronously with respect to the read side.\n- `wrreq` signifies a request to write the data present on `data[15:0]` to the FIFO.

It is the narrower side of the mixed-width FIFO and outputs 8-bit data chunks.\n- `rdempty` is an indicator that goes high when there are no valid data entries left to read in the FIFO, signaling that the FIFO is empty on the read side.\n- `wrfull` is an indicator that goes high when the FIFO has reached its storage capacity on the write side and can no longer accept new data entries until some data has been read out."
