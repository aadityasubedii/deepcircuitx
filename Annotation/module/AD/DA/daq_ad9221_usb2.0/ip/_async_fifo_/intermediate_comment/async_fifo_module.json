    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'async_fifo' module implements an asynchronous FIFO buffer capable of handling mixed-width data transfers under different clock domains. It achieves this using a 'dcfifo_mixed_widths_component' configured for separate read and write operations, utilizing internal signal connections to synchronize and communicate statuses like full or empty queues efficiently."
