    "module": "Module-level comment: The full_adder_1bit module implements a 1-bit full adder in Verilog that calculates the sum and carry-out of three single-bit inputs: a, b, and cin. The module computes 'sum' via the XOR operation of all inputs, and 'carry' using a combination of AND and OR operations on input pairs, directly achieving the full adder function without internal signals."
