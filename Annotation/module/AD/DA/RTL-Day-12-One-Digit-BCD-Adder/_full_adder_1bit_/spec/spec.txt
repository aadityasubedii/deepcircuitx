Module name: full_adder_1bit.
Module specification: The full_adder_1bit module is a hardware design described in Verilog, which performs the addition of three single-bit binary numbers: 'a', 'b', and 'cin'. These serve as input ports to the module, where 'a' and 'b' are the bits to be added and 'cin' is the carry-in from a previous addition if any. The module provides two output ports: 'sum' and 'carry'. 'Sum' is the result of the bitwise XOR operation performed on the three inputs, representing the addition's bit-wise sum without considering the carry, while 'carry' is the carry-out resulting from the addition, derived from any two of the input bits being high, by using a combination of AND and OR operations. There are no internal signals used within the module; rather, the output computation is done directly with the input signals. The design is simple, with only boolean logic operations forming the two assignment statements within the module, where the first assigns the result to 'sum' and the second to 'carry', encapsulating the entire functionality of a 1-bit full adder.
