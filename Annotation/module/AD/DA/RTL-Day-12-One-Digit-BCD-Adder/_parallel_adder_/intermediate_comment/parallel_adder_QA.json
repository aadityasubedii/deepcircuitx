It takes two 4-bit inputs, A and B, and a carry input, Cin. The module outputs a 4-bit sum, S, and a carry out, Cout. The addition is handled by four instances of a 'full_adder_1bit' module, which perform bit-wise addition, propagating carry bits from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. This design effectively creates a 4-bit ripple carry adder."
