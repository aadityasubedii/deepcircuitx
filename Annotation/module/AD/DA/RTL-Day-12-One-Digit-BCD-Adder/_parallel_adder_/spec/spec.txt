Module name: parallel_adder. Module specification: The 'parallel_adder' is a Verilog module purposed for performing a 4-bit binary addition. It takes two 4-bit input vectors, 'A' and 'B', and a single-bit input 'Cin' which serves as a carry-in from previous stages of addition. The output consists of a 4-bit sum vector 'S' and a single-bit carry-out 'Cout', with 'S' representing the direct sum of 'A' and 'B' excluding the carry-out, and 'Cout' signifying the carry-out from the most significant bit addition for cascading in larger arithmetic operations. Internally, the module uses three single-bit wires 'c0', 'c1', and 'c2' to hold intermediate carry bits that propagate between the cascaded full adder stages. The module encapsulates four instances of a 'full_adder_1bit' sub-module, each responsible for adding corresponding bits of 'A' and 'B' along with the propagated carry bit from the previous stage and thus implements a 4-bit ripple carry adder structure. The first instance 'F0' processes the least significant bits and the carry-in 'Cin', while the final instance 'F3' provides the most significant bits addition and the carry-out 'Cout'. This organized chaining of full adders enables the 'parallel_adder' to deliver a coherent and precise addition of two 4-bit binary numbers.
