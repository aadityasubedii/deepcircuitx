Module-level comment: The 'parallel_adder' module performs 4-bit binary addition, taking two 4-bit inputs 'A', 'B', and a carry-in 'Cin'. Outputs a 4-bit sum 'S' and a carry-out 'Cout'. It employs a ripple carry adder architecture using four 'full_adder_1bit' instances for bit-wise addition and carry propagation, connecting the carries between stages with internal wires 'c0', 'c1', and 'c2' for efficient summation.
