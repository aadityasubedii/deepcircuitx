    "module": "Module-level comment: The `one_digit_BCD_adder` module adds two 4-bit BCD digits (A, B) and an input carry (Cin), producing a 4-bit BCD sum (S) and an output carry (C). It utilizes two `parallel_adder` instances: P1 to compute an intermediate sum and carry, and P2 to finalize S after any necessary BCD-correction, determined by internal logic involving additional wires w1, w2, and correction factor CF."
