BCD uses 4 bits to represent the decimal digits 0 to 9. The adder takes two 4-bit BCD inputs, A and B, and an input carry (Cin), and outputs a 4-bit sum (S) and an output carry (C). The module internally uses a `parallel_adder` instance P1 to add A and B along with the input carry, generating an intermediate sum (Z) and a carry (K). Afterward, it checks for any necessary BCD corrections. If a correction is needed, because the BCD sum can't be more than 9 and the raw output of a binary addition may exceed this, the carry-out bits are considered. Logic gates (and, or) compute the final carry-out, using the intermediate outputs Z[1], Z[2], Z[3], and the carry-out K from P1. Wires w1 and w2 are used for intermediate logic to determine the final carry-out. A second `parallel_adder` P2 adds the intermediate sum Z and a correction factor CF (determined by the final carry-out C) along with the input carry Cin to produce the final BCD sum S that is output from the module."
