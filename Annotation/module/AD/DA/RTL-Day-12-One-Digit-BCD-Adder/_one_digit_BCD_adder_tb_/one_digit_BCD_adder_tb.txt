Module-level comment: The `one_digit_BCD_adder_tb` testbench module rigorously tests a `one_digit_BCD_adder`, applying a sequence of BCD digit pairs to the adder inputs (`A` and `B`) and a fixed carry-in (`Cin`). It stimulates the adder every 5-time units to evaluate its sum (`S`) and carry-out (`C`) outputs for correctness. The testbench cycle ends the simulation after all digit combinations are tested.
