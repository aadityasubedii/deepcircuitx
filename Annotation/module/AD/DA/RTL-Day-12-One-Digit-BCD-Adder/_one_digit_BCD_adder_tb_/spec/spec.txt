Module name: one_digit_BCD_adder_tb. Module specification: The `one_digit_BCD_adder_tb` is a testbench module designed specifically to verify the functionality of the `one_digit_BCD_adder` which performs addition on two 4-bit BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) digits. This testbench includes input ports `A` and `B`, which are both 4-bit registers accepting BCD values between 0 and 9, and `Cin`, a single-bit register representing the carry-in. Its output ports include `S`, a 4-bit wire outputting the sum of `A` and `B`, and `C`, a single-bit wire indicating carry-out if the sum exceeds the BCD range. The internal signals in this module are quite straightforward, as they primarily involve the setting and updating of the inputs to the `one_digit_BCD_adder`, instantiated as `dut`. The testbench code controls stimulus application through an `initial` block that sequentially assigns different combinations of BCD values to `A` and `B` every 5-time units, keeping `Cin` consistently at zero, thereby cycling through possible BCD addition scenarios to ensure `dut` processes BCD inputs correctly. A `$finish` command terminates the simulation once all tests have run.
