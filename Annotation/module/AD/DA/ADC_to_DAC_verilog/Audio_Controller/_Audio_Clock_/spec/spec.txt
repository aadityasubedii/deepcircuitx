Module name: Audio_Clock.
Module specification: The Audio_Clock module is designed to utilize an input clock signal (`inclk0`) to generate different clock signals. It includes input ports `areset` (for asynchronous reset, not utilized in the current snippet) and `inclk0` (the primary clock input which drives counter incrementation). The output ports are `c0` (derived from the second least significant bit of an internal counter, providing a clock signal at a quarter frequency of `inclk0`) and `locked` (mentioned but not assigned within the provided code, suggesting its use in broader clock management). Internally, the module uses an 11-bit register `COUNTER_500`, which counts the clock cycles of `inclk0`, and a wire `CLOCK_500` derived from the tenth bit of `COUNTER_500`, hypothetically used for additional clock management though not connected to an output pin. The primary block of the code consists of an always block that increments `COUNTER_500` on each positive edge of `inclk0`, used to derive output signals and manage internal clock generation. This module is instrumental in creating derived clock signals for presumably audio-related applications requiring multiple synchronizations or frequency-based operations.
