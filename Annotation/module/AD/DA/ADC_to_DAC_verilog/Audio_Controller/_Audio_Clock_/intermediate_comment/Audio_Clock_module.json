    "module": "Module-level comment: The Audio_Clock module generates derivative clock signals from an input clock `inclk0`. It employs an 11-bit counter (`COUNTER_500`), incrementing on each positive edge of `inclk0`. Output `c0` is derived from the counter's second least significant bit, providing a clock quartered in frequency. Internally, `CLOCK_500`, extracted from the tenth bit, suggests further clock division use, though not outputted. The module encapsulates frequency division and signal derivation functionalities critical for audio synchronization or other frequency-dependent operations."
