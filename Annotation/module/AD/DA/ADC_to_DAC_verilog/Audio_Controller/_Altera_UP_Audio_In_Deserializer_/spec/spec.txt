Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer. 

Module specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer is designed to handle serial audio data by deserializing and managing it within two FIFO buffers specific to left and right audio channels. Its primary functions include deserializing incoming serial audio data according to the bit and left/right clock edges and synchronizing the audio channels. The main input signals include a system clock (`clk`), reset signal (`reset`), bit clock edges (`bit_clk_rising_edge`, `bit_clk_falling_edge`), left/right channel distinguishers (`left_right_clk_rising_edge`, `left_right_clk_falling_edge`), a synchronization completion indicator (`done_channel_sync`), and the serial audio in data (`serial_audio_in_data`). Control signals (`read_left_audio_data_en`, `read_right_audio_data_en`) manage the reading from the FIFOs. The output ports provide available space in the FIFOs (`left_audio_fifo_read_space`, `right_audio_fifo_read_space`) and parallelized audio data (`left_channel_data`, `right_channel_data`) for further processing. Internally, signals like `valid_audio_input`, shift registers (`data_in_shift_reg`), and FIFO status indicators (`left_channel_fifo_is_empty`, `right_channel_fifo_is_full`, etc.) ensure accurate operation and data handling. The code encapsulates module instances for bit counting and synchronized FIFO for both audio channels. The utilization of these modules along with signal conditioning and bit manipulations via `always` blocks define its comprehensive functionality to manage audio data efficiently.
