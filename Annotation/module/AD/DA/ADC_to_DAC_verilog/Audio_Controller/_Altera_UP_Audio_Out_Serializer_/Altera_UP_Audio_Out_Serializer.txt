Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer module serializes parallel audio data for left and right channels into a single output stream, utilizing edge-triggered clocks for timing. It employs FIFOs for buffering audio data, manages FIFO states with internal signals, and adjusts serialization dynamics through two instances of SYNC_FIFO parameterized for audio data handling. This design ensures continuous, timed output suitable for digital audio interfaces.
