Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer.

Module specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer is crafted to serialize audio data from parallel inputs for left and right audio channels into a serial output stream. It features inputs for main clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), bit clock edges (`bit_clk_rising_edge`, `bit_clk_falling_edge`), and left-right clock edges (`left_right_clk_rising_edge`, `left_right_clk_falling_edge`) to synchronize and time the serialization process effectively. The parallel audio data for left (`left_channel_data`) and right (`right_channel_data`) channels are managed through respective enable signals (`left_channel_data_en`, `right_channel_data_en`). Outputs include the serialized audio data (`serial_audio_out_data`) and FIFO write space indicators (`left_channel_fifo_write_space`, `right_channel_fifo_write_space`) which assist in managing FIFO buffer states. Internally, the module uses signals like `read_left_channel`, `read_right_channel`, and status indicators for FIFO states (`left_channel_fifo_is_empty`, `right_channel_fifo_is_full`, etc.) to control data flow and serialization integrity. The code is structured to perform tasks in separate always blocks, handling resets, data serialization, and FIFO management efficiently. The design utilizes two instance modules, `Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO`, for both audio channels, parameterized for depth and width, which manage FIFO operations including data writing, reading, and providing FIFO status. The specified module smoothly integrates with systems requiring audio data serialization for outputs, particularly adapting features for robust digital audio applications.
