It takes parallel audio data input for both the left and right channels and, through internal FIFOs (First-In-First-Out memories), queues the data for serialization. The module handles both rising and falling edges of the bit clock and the left-right clock to properly time the output of serialized audio data. Additionally, it provides mechanisms to manage FIFO write space, ensuring that data is input to the FIFOs only when there is available space, and controls the serialization of the audio data to the output pin, serial_audio_out_data, based on the state of the incoming clocks and the FIFO read requests. This module is specifically designed for use in systems where audio data needs to be output in a serialized format, such as in digital audio applications."
