Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter.
Module specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter is a Verilog module tailored for audio applications, precisely for managing audio bit stream timing via a counting mechanism. It receives clock-related signals through its input ports: `clk`, the main clock that synchronizes module operations; `reset`, which initializes the counter; `bit_clk_rising_edge` and `bit_clk_falling_edge`, which signal the rising and falling edges of the audio bit clock; and `left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge`, denoting transitions in the left/right clock essential for resetting the counter other than the global reset. The single output port, `counting`, acts as a status flag indicating when the counter is active. Within the module, the internal signal `reset_bit_counter` is a wire that logically ORs the left/right clock transition signals, serving as an additional reset trigger. Another internal signal, `bit_counter`, is a 5-bit register representing the current count value, decremented on the falling edge of the bit clock unless it is already zero. The code is organized into a declarative section for setting up the parameters, input and output ports; continuous assignments to derive the `reset_bit_counter`; and always blocks that define the logic for resetting and updating the `bit_counter`, as well as the `counting` status based on the inputs and internal state.
