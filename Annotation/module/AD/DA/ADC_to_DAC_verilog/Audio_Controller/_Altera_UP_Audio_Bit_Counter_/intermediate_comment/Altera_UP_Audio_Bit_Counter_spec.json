    "spec": "Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter.\nModule specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter is a Verilog module tailored for audio applications, precisely for managing audio bit stream timing via a counting mechanism. It receives clock-related signals through its input ports: `clk`, the main clock that synchronizes module operations; `reset`, which initializes the counter; `bit_clk_rising_edge` and `bit_clk_falling_edge`, which signal the rising and falling edges of the audio bit clock; and `left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge`, denoting transitions in the left/right clock essential for resetting the counter other than the global reset. The single output port, `counting`, acts as a status flag indicating when the counter is active. Within the module, the internal signal `reset_bit_counter` is a wire that logically ORs the left/right clock transition signals, serving as an additional reset trigger. Another internal signal, `bit_counter`, is a 5-bit register representing the current count value, decremented on the falling edge of the bit clock unless it is already zero. The code is organized into a declarative section for setting up the parameters, input and output ports; continuous assignments to derive the `reset_bit_counter`; and always blocks that define the logic for resetting and updating the `bit_counter`, as well as the `counting` status based on the inputs and internal state.",

It utilizes various clock signals related to audio bit stream management, such as the bit clock and the left/right clock. The module counts down from a predefined initial value (31) with each falling edge of the bit clock until it reaches zero, under certain conditions controlled by a reset signal and edge detections of the left/right clock. The counting is activated or deactivated based on these conditions to help coordinate the timing of audio data processing."

It synchronizes the operations of the entire module, including the counting mechanism and reset functionalities.\n- `reset`: A signal to initialize or reset the counter and counting status. When high (1'b1), it sets the counter to an initial value and disables counting.\n- `bit_clk_rising_edge`: This input signal indicates a rising edge of the bit clock, which is relevant for synchronization purposes in audio applications but is not directly used in this module for counting.\n- `bit_clk_falling_edge`: This input signals a falling edge of the bit clock. The module uses this edge to decrement the bit counter, moving one step closer to completing a counting cycle.\n- `left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge`: These signals represent the rising and falling edges of the left/right clock, respectively. They are used to control the reset of the bit counter other than the global reset, indicating the beginning of a new cycle of data.\n\nOutput ports: counting.\nExplanation: \n- `counting`: This output port is a flag that represents whether the module is currently counting. It is set high (1'b1) when the module starts counting down from the initial bit counter value following a reset (either global reset or controlled by left/right clock edges) and is set low (1'b0) when the bit counter reaches 0, indicating the end of a counting cycle."

Its role in the module is to determine when the bit counter should be reset to its initial value (`BIT_COUNTER_INIT`), aside from the global `reset` signal. Essentially, it serves as a secondary mechanism to trigger the reset of the counter, which is crucial for synchronizing the counting process with the left/right clock transitions in audio data streams.\n\n- `bit_counter`: A 5-bit register that holds the current value of the bit counter. This register is used to count down from the predefined initial value (`BIT_COUNTER_INIT`) with each falling edge of the bit clock (`bit_clk_falling_edge`), provided it is not already at zero. The `bit_counter` is critical for managing the duration of the counting phase within the module, indicating how many bit clock cycles are left before the counting process is completed. Its value directly influences the `counting` output signal, determining whether the module is in the counting state or not."
