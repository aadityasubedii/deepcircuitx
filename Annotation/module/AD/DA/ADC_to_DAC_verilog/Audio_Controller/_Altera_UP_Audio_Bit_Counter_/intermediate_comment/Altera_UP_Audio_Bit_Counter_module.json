    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter is a Verilog module functioning as an audio bit stream counter. It counts down from a parameterized initial value on bit clock falling edges and resets with either a global `reset` or left/right clock edges. Internally, it utilizes a 5-bit `bit_counter` and a `reset_bit_counter` logic. Output `counting` reflects active counting status. Logic is encapsulated in always blocks triggered on the main `clk`."
