It interfaces with external audio codecs (for analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion) using the I2S (Inter-IC Sound) protocol.\n\nThe core functionalities handled by this module include:\n- Synchronizing the audio data streams with the system clock (CLOCK_50).\n- Handling the reset condition (`reset`) signaling for initializing or clearing states.\n- Managing the audio input memory (`clear_audio_in_memory`, `read_audio_in`) and the audio output memory (`clear_audio_out_memory`, `write_audio_out`).\n- Detecting clock edges of the bit clock (`AUD_BCLK`), the ADC left/right clock (`AUD_ADCLRCK`), and the DAC left/right clock (`AUD_DACLRCK`) to properly time the serialization/deserialization process.\n- Keeping track of the availability of audio input (`audio_in_available`) and the allowance of audio output (`audio_out_allowed`).\n- Indicating when ADC and DAC channels are synchronized (`done_adc_channel_sync`, `done_dac_channel_sync`).\n- Holding and serving the deserialized audio input data (`left_channel_audio_in`, `right_channel_audio_in`) and accepting serialized audio output data (`left_channel_audio_out`, `right_channel_audio_out`).\n- Generating an audio clock (`AUD_XCK`) for the external audio codec.\n- Driving the serial output data to the DAC (`AUD_DACDAT`).\n\nAdditionally, the Verilog code makes use of several submodules to handle specific subtasks like edge detection (`Altera_UP_Clock_Edge`) and audio data serialization/deserialization (`Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer`, `Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer`). Parametrization is used for certain constants like `AUDIO_DATA_WIDTH` (representing bit width of the audio data) and `BIT_COUNTER_INIT` (initial value for a bit counter used in the deserializer)."
