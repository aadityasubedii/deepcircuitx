Module name: Audio_Controller. Module specification: The Audio_Controller module is designed to manage audio data input and output in FPGA-based systems, interfacing with external audio codecs via the I2S protocol. Its responsibilities encompass synchronizing audio data streams with the FPGA's system clock (CLOCK_50), initializing system states with a reset signal, handling audio input and output memory operations, serializing and deserializing audio data, and generating necessary clocks for audio processing. The module features input ports like the system clock (CLOCK_50), reset signal (reset), signals for clearing and reading/writing to audio memory, and the serial audio data input from ADC (AUD_ADCDAT). Output ports include bidirectional bit and left/right clocks (AUD_BCLK, AUD_ADCLRCK, AUD_DACLRCK), flags indicating data availability and output allowance (audio_in_available, audio_out_allowed), deserialized audio data for input channels, and outputs for the external DAC (AUD_XCK, AUD_DACDAT).

Internal signals such as edge detection flags for the bit clock and ADC/DAC left/right clocks, space availability in FIFO queues for audio data management, and synchronization status signals are crucial for controlling data flow and synchronization. The module uses these signals to coordinate the activities of submodules that detect clock edges (Altera_UP_Clock_Edge), serialize and deserialize audio data (Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer and Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer), and generate an audio clock for external codecs (Audio_Clock). Each section of the code has a defined role, from declaring parameters and ports, handling data availability and synchronization logic, to integrating with submodules for performing specific tasks like edge detection and data serialization/deserialization. This comprehensive and structured approach ensures the efficient and effective management of audio data within FPGA-based systems.
