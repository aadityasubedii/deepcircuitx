Module-level comment: The Audio_Controller module manages audio data for FPGA systems using I2S protocol, synchronizing audio streams to the system clock and interfacing with ADC/DAC through serial data transfers. It controls input/output operations and memory, detects clock edges, and manages data serialization/deserialization. The module utilizes internal signals for functionally important tasks and submodules to handle clock edge detection, data handling, and clock generation, ensuring robust and synchronized audio processing.
