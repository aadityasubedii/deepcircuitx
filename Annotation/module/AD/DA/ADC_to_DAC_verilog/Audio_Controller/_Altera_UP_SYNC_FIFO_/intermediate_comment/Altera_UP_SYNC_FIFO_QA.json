It supports basic FIFO operations including writing data to the queue (`write_en` for enabling writes, `write_data` for the data input), reading data from the queue (`read_en` for enabling reads, `read_data` for the output data), and provides status flags (`fifo_is_empty`, `fifo_is_full`) and metadata (`words_used` indicating the number of words currently stored in the FIFO). The FIFO's size and data width are parameterizable (`DATA_DEPTH`, `DATA_WIDTH` respectively) and it directly interfaces with Altera's `scfifo` system component configured for custom depth, word width, and address width, with additional options such as adding a RAM output register, overflow/underflow checking disabled for performance, and using embedded array blocks (EAB) for storage."
