Module name: Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO. Module specification: The Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO is a Verilog module designed to implement a synchronous FIFO (First-In, First-Out) memory queue, particularly optimized for Altera devices, targeting the Cyclone II family. The module facilitates basic FIFO operations including data writing and reading while providing status flags and metadata. The input ports consist of a clock signal (`clk`) for synchronizing operations, an asynchronous reset signal (`reset`) for initializing the FIFO, a write enable signal (`write_en`) and data input (`write_data`) for writing operations, and a read enable signal (`read_en`) for reading operations. Output ports include `fifo_is_empty` and `fifo_is_full` status signals, `words_used` indicating the count of words in the FIFO, and `read_data` for outputting read data. The module does not explicitly declare internal signals in its code since it acts as a wrapper, directly interfacing with an instance of the `scfifo` component for its functionality. Thus, typical FIFO internal signals such as `write_pointer`, `read_pointer`, `fifo_memory`, and `fifo_status_flags` are inherently managed within the `scfifo` system component. The code is organized into declarations of parameters (such as `DATA_WIDTH`, `DATA_DEPTH`, and `ADDR_WIDTH`), I/O port definitions, and the instantiation of the `scfifo` system component which actualizes the FIFO logic, including parameter configurations like FIFO depth, data width, and additional options (e.g., RAM output register, overflow/underflow checking, and storage method). This structure allows the Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO module to efficiently manage data storage and retrieval in a FIFO manner, underlining its role as a versatile and parameterizable FIFO queue for system-level applications in Altera FPGA designs.
