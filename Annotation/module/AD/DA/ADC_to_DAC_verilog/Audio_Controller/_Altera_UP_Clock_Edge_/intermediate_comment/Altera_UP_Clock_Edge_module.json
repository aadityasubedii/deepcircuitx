    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module detects rising and falling edges of a signal (`test_clk`) based on the system clock (`clk`). It catches transitions by sampling `test_clk` at each positive edge of `clk`, storing current and last states in `cur_test_clk` and `last_test_clk`, respectively. Edge detection is implemented using XOR operation between these registers, where output signals `rising_edge` and `falling_edge` are set based on the XOR outcome."
