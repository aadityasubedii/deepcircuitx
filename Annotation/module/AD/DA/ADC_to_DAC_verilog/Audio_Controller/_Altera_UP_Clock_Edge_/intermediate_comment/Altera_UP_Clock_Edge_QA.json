When the module sees that `test_clk` has transitioned from a low to a high state between two consecutive positive edges of `clk`, it considers this a rising edge. Conversely, the module detects a falling edge when `test_clk` transitions from high to low between two consecutive positive edges of `clk`. To achieve this functionality, the module samples `test_clk` on the rising edges of `clk` and stores the results in two registers, `cur_test_clk` and `last_test_clk`. It then uses an exclusive OR (XOR) operation to determine if an edge (rising or falling) has been found by comparing the current and the last sample of `test_clk`. The outputs `rising_edge` and `falling_edge` signals indicate the detection of a respective edge event. The module also includes a `reset` signal, which is not used in the provided code but is typically used to reset the registers to a known state upon initialization or any reset event."
