    "spec": "Module name: Altera_UP_Clock_Edge.\nModule specification: The Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module is built to detect rising and falling edges of a test signal (`test_clk`) using the system clock signal (`clk`). It includes three input ports: `clk`, the main system clock which synchronizes the detection process; `reset`, a signal for resetting the module which is not implemented in the current code; and `test_clk`, the signal under observation for edge transitions. The outputs of the module are `rising_edge` and `falling_edge`, which signal the detection of a rising and falling edge on `test_clk`, respectively. Internally, the module employs two registers, `cur_test_clk` and `last_test_clk`, to store the current and previous states of `test_clk`. It also uses a wire signal `found_edge` for indicating if a change has occurred between these two states. The code contains two always blocks that sample `test_clk` on the rising edge of `clk` and update the registers accordingly, and two assign statements that generate the output signals using the results from the exclusive OR (XOR) operation on the registers, thus highlighting an edge event. The structure of the Verilog code consists of module declaration, I/O port declarations, internal signal and register declarations, always blocks for signal sampling, and continuous assignments for edge detection and output generation.",

When the module sees that `test_clk` has transitioned from a low to a high state between two consecutive positive edges of `clk`, it considers this a rising edge. Conversely, the module detects a falling edge when `test_clk` transitions from high to low between two consecutive positive edges of `clk`. To achieve this functionality, the module samples `test_clk` on the rising edges of `clk` and stores the results in two registers, `cur_test_clk` and `last_test_clk`. It then uses an exclusive OR (XOR) operation to determine if an edge (rising or falling) has been found by comparing the current and the last sample of `test_clk`. The outputs `rising_edge` and `falling_edge` signals indicate the detection of a respective edge event. The module also includes a `reset` signal, which is not used in the provided code but is typically used to reset the registers to a known state upon initialization or any reset event."
