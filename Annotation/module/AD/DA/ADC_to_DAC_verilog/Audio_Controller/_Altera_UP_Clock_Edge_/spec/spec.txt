Module name: Altera_UP_Clock_Edge.
Module specification: The Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module is built to detect rising and falling edges of a test signal (`test_clk`) using the system clock signal (`clk`). It includes three input ports: `clk`, the main system clock which synchronizes the detection process; `reset`, a signal for resetting the module which is not implemented in the current code; and `test_clk`, the signal under observation for edge transitions. The outputs of the module are `rising_edge` and `falling_edge`, which signal the detection of a rising and falling edge on `test_clk`, respectively. Internally, the module employs two registers, `cur_test_clk` and `last_test_clk`, to store the current and previous states of `test_clk`. It also uses a wire signal `found_edge` for indicating if a change has occurred between these two states. The code contains two always blocks that sample `test_clk` on the rising edge of `clk` and update the registers accordingly, and two assign statements that generate the output signals using the results from the exclusive OR (XOR) operation on the registers, thus highlighting an edge event. The structure of the Verilog code consists of module declaration, I/O port declarations, internal signal and register declarations, always blocks for signal sampling, and continuous assignments for edge detection and output generation.
