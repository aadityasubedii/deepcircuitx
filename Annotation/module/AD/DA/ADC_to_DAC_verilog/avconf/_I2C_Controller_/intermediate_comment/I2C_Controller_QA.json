It takes input signals such as clock, data, start control signal (GO), reset, and read/write control (W_R). The module handles the serial clock (I2C_SCLK) and serial data (I2C_SDAT) lines based on a 24-bit data input and the state of input control signals. It sequences through the various stages of sending or receiving data over I2C, managing data transmission, acknowledgment from the slave device, and signal timing, indicated by an \"END\" signal when the transmission cycle completes.

It signals when the data transfer process is complete.\n- ACK: Provides an acknowledgment signal, typically received from the slave device after data exchange which indicates successful data reception.\n- SD_COUNTER: A 6-bit output that likely serves as a debug or monitoring tool showing the current state or position in the I2C communication sequence.\n- SDO: The actual data bit being transmitted at any given time in the sequence. This might be either directly from the I2C_DATA input or could be control related data depending on the state of the transfer."

It represents the current data bit that is being transmitted onto the I2C bus.\n- SCLK: A register that mimics the I2C serial clock (I2C_SCLK).
