Module name: I2C_Controller. 

Module specification: The I2C_Controller is a Verilog module designed to manage I2C protocol communication through serial data and clock control. Key input ports include CLOCK for timing signals, I2C_DATA for a 24-bit data input, GO to start transmission, RESET to return to the initial state, and W_R to determine the read or write operation. Output ports consist of I2C_SCLK and I2C_SDAT for the serial clock and data lines, END to indicate the completion of a transaction, ACK as an acknowledgment signal, SD_COUNTER for monitoring the sequence state, and SDO for the current data bit. Internal signals like SDO and SCLK manage the serial data and clock output respectively, while SD temporarily stores the I2C data and SD_COUNTER tracks transmission stages. ACK1, ACK2, and ACK3 are used to handle acknowledgment from the slave device, combining to form the ACK output. The code controls the data transfer through a state machine, sequencing operations from data initialization, through bit-by-bit data handling, to final acknowledgment and transmission end, governed primarily via the SD_COUNTER's defined states and transitions conditioned on CLOCK and RESET signals.
