Module-level comment: The I2C_Controller module implements an I2C bus master controller in Verilog, handling data transmission and clock synchronization. It uses input signals and internal registers to drive the I2C_SCLK and I2C_SDAT lines, along with a state machine that progresses through data send/receive stages, generates an acknowledgment, and signals transaction end, conditioned on the CLOCK and RESET inputs.
