Module name: avconf.

Module specification: The "avconf" module is designed to configure audio and video settings via an I2C interface, operating primarily with multimedia application peripherals. It utilizes a 50 MHz system clock (CLOCK_50) and responds to a synchronous reset for initialization. The module monitors volume_key input for adjusting volume and a sound_select input to choose the sound configuration. It generates output signals for the I2C serial clock (I2C_SCLK) and serial data (I2C_SDAT), which are used for communication on the I2C bus.

The module incorporates several internal signals such as mI2C_CLK_DIV for dividing the system clock to match the I2C speed, mI2C_DATA for holding configuration data, mI2C_CTRL_CLK as a control clock for I2C transactions, and control signals like mI2C_GO, mI2C_END, and mI2C_ACK to manage and monitor I2C communications. Additional signals like iRST_N, LUT_DATA, LUT_INDEX, mSetup_ST, vol, volume, and sound_selector support reset logic, audio setting lookup table indexing, state machine operation for setup, and capturing volume and sound selections.

The module is structured into several blocks of code. The first block sets up clock division for I2C timing and instantiates the I2C_Controller sub-module for I2C behavior modeling. The next block, a state machine, orchestrates the configuration process by sequencing through a lookup table of audio settings and invoking I2C transactions for each setting. Additional always blocks manage volume adjustment logic upon volume_key events, capture of sound selections during reset, and a combinational always block that constructs the lookup table data based on indexed registers and predefined parameters. Together, these blocks facilitate multi-functional configuration of an AV system through precise hardware-driven I2C communication.
