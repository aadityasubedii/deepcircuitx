Module-level comment: The "avconf" Verilog module configures audio/video settings over I2C. It handles volume control, sound selection, and communication setup with peripherals using a 50 MHz clock. Internally, it implements a state machine, clock dividers, and a lookup table to execute the I2C protocol and dispatch configuration data, managing sequencing and error checking for robust operations.
