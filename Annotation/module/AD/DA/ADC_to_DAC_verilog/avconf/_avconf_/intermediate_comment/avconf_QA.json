It drives various setup parameters to an external device (presumably an audio/video codec or similar device) using the I2C_Controller circuit. The module operates based on a system clock and is responsive to reset conditions and volume adjustments. It includes a lookup table (LUT) that defines specific register configurations for different settings such as volume level, audio paths for input and output, and video configuration. The module operates these configurations based on the I2C communication protocol, sending this data when the I2C_GO control signal is activated and sequencing through the LUT entries depending on operation conditions and feedback from the I2C transaction (acknowledgment and end conditions). The interconnect with the I2C controller is defined within, taking care of clocking and data synchronization requirements for reliable I2C transactions."

It is an event that activates on the positive edge of the signal to adjust the volume level.\n- sound_select: This 3-bit input selects the sound configuration. It is captured into the module on the positive edge of the reset.\n\nOutput ports: I2C_SCLK, I2C_SDAT.\nExplanation: \n- I2C_SCLK: This is the I2C serial clock line for the I2C bus, driven by the module to synchronize data transmission to the audio/video peripherals.\n- I2C_SDAT: This is the I2C serial data line, an open-drain/in-out bidirectional line used for I2C data communication with the peripherals. It is used to send and receive data on the I2C bus.\n\nThe module avconf uses these input and output ports to interact with the I2C bus and configure audio/video settings of an external device using the provided system clock and reset inputs. The volume adjustment is managed locally before being translated into I2C data for the peripheral device."
