    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'ram' module implements a simple synchronous RAM featuring a parameterizable 32-bit width. It supports both read and write operations, controlled by `write1_read0`. On a positive `clock` edge, data is either written from `data_in` to the memory or read from memory to `data_out_display`, based on the control signal. Addresses are managed by an internally incremented counter `address`, which resets on an active low `reset` signal. The memory is constructed of a 65536-location array `register`, maintaining the integrity of data operations."
