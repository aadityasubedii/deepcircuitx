It is designed to operate on a 32-bit data width, as indicated by the 'data_size' parameter, but can be adjusted as needed. The RAM has two main operations governed by the input 'write1_read0'; writing data to the memory when 'write1_read0' is high and reading from the memory when 'write1_read0' is low. \n\nDuring a write operation, the data from 'data_in' is stored into the memory location pointed by the internal 'address' register. During a read operation, the data from the memory location pointed by 'address' is presented on the 'data_out_display' output.\n\nThe 'address' counter increments with each positive edge of the 'clock' signal provided the 'reset' is not active. If 'reset' is active (low), the 'address' counter is reset to 0.

It is essential for the sequential logic that updates the address counter and drives the memory read/write operations on positive clock edges.\n- `reset`: The reset input port is used to clear the internal address counter to zero when it is asserted with a low signal (active low). This ensures that the RAM starts operating from a known state after reset.\n- `write1_read0`: This input port is a control signal that determines the operation mode of the RAM. When high (`1`), the module performs a write operation, and when low (`0`), it performs a read operation.\n- `data_in`: This input port receives the 32-bit data to be written into the RAM when the module performs a write operation.\n\nOutput ports: `data_out_display`.\nExplanation:\n- `data_out_display`: This output port presents the 32-bit data read from the RAM when the module performs a read operation.
