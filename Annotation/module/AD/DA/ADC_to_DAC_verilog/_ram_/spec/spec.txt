Module name: ram. Module specification: The 'ram' module is designed as a simple Random Access Memory (RAM) that performs read and write operations based on a 32-bit data width, with the data size parameterized for flexibility. It operates synchronously with the `clock` input, utilizing an active low `reset` signal to initiate the memory from a known state, a `write1_read0` control signal to determine the operation mode (write when high, read when low), and a `data_in` port to receive data for write operations. The module outputs read data through the `data_out_display` port. Internally, the module uses an `address` register as a counter for navigating through memory locations, incrementing with each positive clock edge unless `reset` is active, which resets the counter to 0. The `register` is an array of 32-bit registers, acting as the memory cells of the RAM, spanning 65536 locations. The Verilog code is structured into two main always blocks: one for updating the address counter on positive clock edges or resetting it on the active low reset, and another for executing write or read operations based on the `write1_read0` control signal. The write operation stores `data_in` into the memory location pointed by `address`, while the read operation outputs the data from the location pointed by `address` to `data_out_display`, both triggered on the positive edge of the `clock`. This specification encapsulates the design and functionality of the 'ram' module, highlighting its input and output dynamics, internal signaling, and operational blocks for efficient memory management.
