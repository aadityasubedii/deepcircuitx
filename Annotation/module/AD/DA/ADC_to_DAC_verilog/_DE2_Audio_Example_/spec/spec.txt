Module name: DE2_Audio_Example.
Module specification: The DE2_Audio_Example module is an FPGA-based audio signal processor that performs sound modulation based on input switch settings. It interfaces with audio conversion hardware to process incoming audio signals by adding a toggling sound signal, determined by the 'SW[3:0]' switches and a base delay, and then outputs the modified audio. 

Input ports include 'CLOCK_50', the main 50 MHz clock signal; `CLOCK_27`, a 27 MHz clock that is present but not used; 'KEY', a 4-bit input for reset and control signals with KEY[0] for reset; 'SW', a 4-bit switch input to set the sound frequency; and 'AUD_ADCDAT', the incoming digital audio data from an ADC. Output ports provided are 'AUD_XCK', the system clock for audio codecs; 'AUD_DACDAT', the DAC data output for external DACs; and 'I2C_SCLK', the I2C clock signal for audio configuration. Inout ports include 'AUD_BCLK', the audio bit clock; 'AUD_ADCLRCK', the audio ADC word clock; 'AUD_DACLRCK', the DAC word clock; and 'I2C_SDAT', the bidirectional I2C data line.

Internal signals serve various functions within the module: 'audio_in_available' indicates if audio input is ready for reading, 'left_channel_audio_in' and 'right_channel_audio_in' hold the incoming left and right audio data respectively, while 'read_audio_in' controls the reading of new input data. 'audio_out_allowed' designates if the output can accept data, and it along with 'left_channel_audio_out' and 'right_channel_audio_out', which hold processed audio data, are controlled by 'write_audio_out'. The `delay_cnt` and `delay` signals along with 'snd' work together to adjust the frequency of an added sound signal, toggling through switch settings. And `sound` is a fixed amplitude value added to the audio signal when 'snd' is high, and subtracted otherwise, which modulates the audio based on the state of 'SW'.

Different code blocks within the module potentially include the always block for delay and sound toggling, the assignments for signals delay, read/write controls, and the processed audio output, as well as instantiations of the 'Audio_Controller' and 'avconf' blocks that handle audio stream reading/writing and I2C configuration, respectively. The 'Audio_Controller' manages the input audio buffer, output buffer, and passes the modified audio data to the DAC, while 'avconf' configures the audio codec settings via I2C. 

This elaborate specification systematically defines the functionalities of the DE2_Audio_Example module, detailing the roles of its inputs, outputs, internal signals, and primary functional blocks essential for audio processing on an FPGA.
