    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE2_Audio_Example module processes audio signals on an FPGA by modulating the incoming audio data with a toggling sound signal based on switch settings 'SW[3:0]'. It utilizes clocks ('CLOCK_50', 'CLOCK_27'), reset and control ('KEY'), and audio-specific I/O ('AUD_ADCDAT', 'AUD_XCK', 'AUD_DACDAT'), alongside internal logic for sound frequency control and audio handling, coordinated through 'Audio_Controller' and 'avconf' blocks for I2C and DAC/ADC configuration."
