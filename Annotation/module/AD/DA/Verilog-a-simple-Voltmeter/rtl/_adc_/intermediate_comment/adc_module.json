    "module": "Module-level comment: The `adc` module performs analog-to-digital signal processing, calculating a median voltage level and sign from sampled ADC data. It divides the system clock to generate sampling instances, accumulates and averages samples to find the median, then applies a scaling factor for voltage calculation. Outputs include the inverted sample clock, calculated voltage, and median-based sign indication."
