The module samples the ADC data (presented as `ad_data` input) at a rate determined by the `sys_clk`. It uses a sub-sampling method controlled by `cnt_sys_clk` and `clk_sample` to manage the sampling frequency. A median calculation is performed by aggregating `ad_data` values until a specified count (`CNT_MEDIAN_MAX`) is reached, at which point the median (average in this implementation) is computed. The result of the median operation influences the calculation of `volt` and the `sign` output. `volt_reg` is calculated based on whether the incoming ADC value is above or below this median, and it is scaled using predefined constants to derive the voltage level. The `sign` output indicates if the sampled data is below (`1`) or above/not equal (`0`) to the median, providing a simplistic directional indication of the ADC value relative to the median. The module also generates an `ad_clk` output which is inversely related to the `clk_sample`, mainly used for external interfacing."
