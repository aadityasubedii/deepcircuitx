    "spec": "Module name: adc. Module specification: The `adc` module is designed to perform analog-to-digital conversion by sampling ADC data and calculating the median voltage value and sign. This module operates on three primary inputs: a system clock (`sys_clk`), an active-low synchronous reset (`sys_rst_n`), and 8-bit ADC data (`ad_data`). The outputs include an ADC clock (`ad_clk`) for external ADC interfacing, a 16-bit voltage level (`volt`), and a single-bit sign (`sign`) indicating whether the sampled ADC data is below or at/above the median value. Internally, the module utilizes several signals such as `cnt_sys_clk` and `clk_sample` to manage clock division and sampling frequency. Counters like `cnt_median` keep track of sampled data counts, and registers like `data_sum_m` and `data_median` are used for summing ADC values and storing the median. The design is structured into multiple code blocks: clock division, sample counter control, ADC data accumulation, median calculation, scaling constants setup (`data_n`, `data_p`), voltage and sign calculation based on the median, and output assignments for `volt`, `sign`, and `ad_clk`. These blocks collectively enable the module to compute a median-based voltage representation and directionality of incoming ADC data, facilitating interfaces to digital systems.",

The module samples the ADC data (presented as `ad_data` input) at a rate determined by the `sys_clk`. It uses a sub-sampling method controlled by `cnt_sys_clk` and `clk_sample` to manage the sampling frequency. A median calculation is performed by aggregating `ad_data` values until a specified count (`CNT_MEDIAN_MAX`) is reached, at which point the median (average in this implementation) is computed. The result of the median operation influences the calculation of `volt` and the `sign` output. `volt_reg` is calculated based on whether the incoming ADC value is above or below this median, and it is scaled using predefined constants to derive the voltage level. The `sign` output indicates if the sampled data is below (`1`) or above/not equal (`0`) to the median, providing a simplistic directional indication of the ADC value relative to the median. The module also generates an `ad_clk` output which is inversely related to the `clk_sample`, mainly used for external interfacing."

                    "text": "Module name: adc. Module specification: The `adc` module is designed to perform analog-to-digital conversion by sampling ADC data and calculating the median voltage value and sign. This module operates on three primary inputs: a system clock (`sys_clk`), an active-low synchronous reset (`sys_rst_n`), and 8-bit ADC data (`ad_data`). The outputs include an ADC clock (`ad_clk`) for external ADC interfacing, a 16-bit voltage level (`volt`), and a single-bit sign (`sign`) indicating whether the sampled ADC data is below or at/above the median value. Internally, the module utilizes several signals such as `cnt_sys_clk` and `clk_sample` to manage clock division and sampling frequency. Counters like `cnt_median` keep track of sampled data counts, and registers like `data_sum_m` and `data_median` are used for summing ADC values and storing the median. The design is structured into multiple code blocks: clock division, sample counter control, ADC data accumulation, median calculation, scaling constants setup (`data_n`, `data_p`), voltage and sign calculation based on the median, and output assignments for `volt`, `sign`, and `ad_clk`. These blocks collectively enable the module to compute a median-based voltage representation and directionality of incoming ADC data, facilitating interfaces to digital systems."
