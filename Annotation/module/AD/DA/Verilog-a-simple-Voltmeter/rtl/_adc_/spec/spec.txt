Module name: adc. Module specification: The `adc` module is designed to perform analog-to-digital conversion by sampling ADC data and calculating the median voltage value and sign. This module operates on three primary inputs: a system clock (`sys_clk`), an active-low synchronous reset (`sys_rst_n`), and 8-bit ADC data (`ad_data`). The outputs include an ADC clock (`ad_clk`) for external ADC interfacing, a 16-bit voltage level (`volt`), and a single-bit sign (`sign`) indicating whether the sampled ADC data is below or at/above the median value. Internally, the module utilizes several signals such as `cnt_sys_clk` and `clk_sample` to manage clock division and sampling frequency. Counters like `cnt_median` keep track of sampled data counts, and registers like `data_sum_m` and `data_median` are used for summing ADC values and storing the median. The design is structured into multiple code blocks: clock division, sample counter control, ADC data accumulation, median calculation, scaling constants setup (`data_n`, `data_p`), voltage and sign calculation based on the median, and output assignments for `volt`, `sign`, and `ad_clk`. These blocks collectively enable the module to compute a median-based voltage representation and directionality of incoming ADC data, facilitating interfaces to digital systems.
