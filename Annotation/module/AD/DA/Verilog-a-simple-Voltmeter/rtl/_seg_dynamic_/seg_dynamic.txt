Module-level comment: The `seg_dynamic` module drives a seven-segment display from a 20-bit numerical input, converting it to BCD, handling sign, and enabling dynamic multiplexing for display refresh every 1 ms. It utilizes internal registers for data storage and timing, a BCD conversion submodule, and sequential logic for digit selection and segment updating based on input signals and internal counters.
