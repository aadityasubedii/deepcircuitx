It handles decimal to BCD conversion along with controlling the multiplexing of the displays. The module takes a system clock (`sys_clk`), an active low reset (`sys_rst_n`), data to be displayed (`data`), a sign bit (`sign`), enable signal for display (`seg_en`), and a specifics for decimal point settings (`point`). The outputs are the segment selector (`sel`) and the segment data (`seg`). It operates by updating the display segments every millisecond, rotating through each digit and updating the segments based on the data provided. The module also includes conditional display logic for positive or negative signs and handles a one millisecond flag for time-based display updates."

When asserted, it initializes or resets the module's internal states and outputs to predefined values.\n- `point`: A 6-bit input specifying the positions of the decimal points for the display. Each bit represents the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of a decimal point for the corresponding display digit.\n- `seg_en`: Segment enable input. When high (`1`), it allows the update of displayed data; when low (`0`), the display does not update.\n- `data`: A 20-bit input representing the value to be displayed on the 7-segment displays. This value is decoded and properly formatted for display.\n- `sign`: A single bit representing the sign of the `data` (`0` for positive, `1` for negative). It influences how the data is displayed, especially with how leading signs are handled.\n\nOutput ports: `sel`, `seg`.\nExplanation: \n- `sel`: A 6-bit output used as a selector or decoder to drive which of the 7-segment displays is currently active. Each bit corresponds to one of the six available digit positions on the display, with a `1` activating the respective display.\n- `seg`: An 8-bit output representing the segments of the currently active 7-segment display. Each bit corresponds to one of the seven segments plus the decimal point, controlling their on/off state to display the correct digit.\n"

They are used for dynamically displaying each digit on the 7-segment display.\n  \n- `data_reg`: A 24-bit register used to store the data that is currently being displayed. This data is dynamically updated based on the input `data`, the `sign`, and the decimal point positions indicated by the `point` input. It effectively stores the current snapshot of the data as it is being displayed.\n  \n- `cnt_1ms`: A 16-bit counter used to create a 1 millisecond timebase for the display update frequency. It counts system clock pulses up to a predefined maximum (`CNT_MAX`) at which point it resets to zero, thereby generating a periodic signal with a period of approximately 1ms.\n  \n- `flag_1ms`: A flag that is set to high (`1`) for a single clock cycle when the `cnt_1ms` counter reaches its maximum value minus one, indicating that 1 millisecond has passed. This flag triggers the update of the display data and the digit being displayed.\n  \n- `cnt_sel`: A 3-bit counter used to select which digit of the display is currently active. It is incremented every 1ms (when `flag_1ms` is high) and wraps around after reaching the maximum display digit count. This ensures that each digit is displayed in turn.\n  \n- `data_disp`: A 4-bit register that stores the data (BCD digit) to be displayed on the current active digit of the 7-segment display. It is loaded with the appropriate segment of `data_reg` based on the value of `cnt_sel`.\n  \n- `sel_reg`: A 6-bit register that holds the current value of the digit selector ('sel'). It is used to activate the appropriate digit on the 7-segment display by setting the corresponding bit to high. It is shifted every millisecond to move the active digit position.\n  \n- `dot_disp`: A single bit that controls the state of the decimal point on the currently active digit of the 7-segment display. It is set or cleared based on the `point` input and the current digit being displayed (`cnt_sel`). This allows the module to dynamically control the presence of decimal points as per the input configuration."
