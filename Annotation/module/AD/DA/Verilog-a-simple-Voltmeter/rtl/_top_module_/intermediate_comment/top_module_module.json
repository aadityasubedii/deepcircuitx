    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'top_module' acts as the top-level entity, interfacing an ADC with a dynamic display. It inputs a system clock, reset, and ADC data, outputting display control signals and an ADC clock. Internally, it uses 'adc' to convert ADC data to a 16-bit digital voltage ('volt_data') with a sign ('sign_adc_seg'), and 'seg_dynamic' to drive the 7-segment display based on 'volt_data' and its sign, ensuring synchronized data handling and display operations."
