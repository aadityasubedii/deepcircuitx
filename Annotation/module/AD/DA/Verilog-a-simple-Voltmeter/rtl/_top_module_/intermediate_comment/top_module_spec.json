    "spec": "Module name: top_module.\n\nModule specification: The `top_module` serves as the primary design entity within a Verilog-based hardware description, interfacing with both an ADC and a dynamic 7-segment display driver. It's designed to synchronize and manage data conversion and display functionality within a digital system. The module takes the system clock signal (`sys_clk`), an active-low system reset (`sys_rst_n`), and an 8-bit digital representation of analog data (`ad_data`) as its input ports. The outputs from the module are a 6-bit selection signal for the display (`sel`), an 8-bit output to control the individual segments of the 7-segment display (`seg`), and a clock signal for the ADC (`ad_clk`). Internally, the `top_module` utilizes two key signals: `volt_data`, a 16-bit wire conveying the voltage data to be displayed, and `sign_adc_seg`, which indicates the polarity of the displayed value. Two sub-modules are instantiated within the code: `adc`, responsible for processing the input `ad_data` into a usable digital format (`volt_data`) and providing the ADC's clock (`ad_clk`), and `seg_dynamic`, responsible for driving the dynamic 7-segment display based on the converted voltage data and displaying the correct sign. This modular design ensures clear separation of concerns, with clean interfaces between the data conversion process and the data display mechanism, providing a versatile top-level architecture for interfacing and operation within a digital system.",

It takes in a system clock (`sys_clk`), a system reset signal (`sys_rst_n`), and 8-bit analog-to-digital data (`ad_data`). Inside the module, there is an instance of an `adc` sub-module that takes the input signals and provides a converted 16-bit voltage data output (`volt_data`) along with a sign indication (`sign_adc_seg`). The `top_module` also instantiates a `seg_dynamic` sub-module, which controls a 7-segment display according to the `volt_data` and the sign, driving selection signals (`sel`) and segment signals (`seg`). Additionally, it generates an ADC clock signal (`ad_clk`) that is fed to the `adc` sub-module, and specifies a point representation through a 6-bit binary input (`6'b001000`) within the `seg_dynamic` sub-module."
