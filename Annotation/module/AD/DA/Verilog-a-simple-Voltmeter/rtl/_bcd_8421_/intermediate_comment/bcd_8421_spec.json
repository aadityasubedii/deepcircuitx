    "spec": "Module name: bcd_8421.\nModule specification: The bcd_8421 module is a digital logic component designed to convert a 20-bit binary input into a Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format across six 4-bit output ports, each representing a decimal digit from units to hundred thousands. It operates synchronously with the system clock `sys_clk`. It uses an active-low reset signal `sys_rst_n` to initialize internal states. The input port `data` is a 20-bit wide binary number that the module converts to BCD format. The output ports `unit`, `ten`, `hun`, `tho`, `t_tho`, and `h_hun` correspond to the unit, ten, hundred, thousand, ten-thousand, and hundred-thousand places in the BCD representation, respectively. Internally, the `cnt_shift` 5-bit counter monitors the number of shift operations (0 to 21), determining when to execute shifts and conditional additions. The `data_shift` 44-bit register stores intermediate values during the conversion, and the `shift_flag` toggles each clock cycle to control shifting versus adding operations. \n\nThe first always block is responsible for toggling the state of `shift_flag` every clock cycle once enabled by the system reset. The second always block handles the counter logic, incrementing `cnt_shift` on each shift phase and clearing it after the last operation. The third always block includes the data shifting and conditional addition sequences; it either loads the `data_shift` register with the extended input data, performs the conditional add-3 operations on appropriate 4-bit groups, or shifts the `data_shift` register left by one bit. Finally, the last always block extracts the BCD digits from `data_shift` and assigns them to the output ports after the final count indicating the end of the conversion cycle. This module is essential in applications requiring the display or further processing of binary data in human-readable decimal form.",

It employs a shift and add-3 algorithm, commonly used in BCD conversion, to process the binary input in a series of shifts and conditional additions. The conversion is synchronized to a system clock (`sys_clk`) and can be reset using an active low reset signal (`sys_rst_n`). The shift process is controlled by two counters: `cnt_shift`, which keeps track of the shift operations and toggles between 0 to 21, and `shift_flag`, a flag that toggles every clock cycle to indicate when to perform the shift or add-3 operation. Upon completion of the shifting and conditional add operations, the BCD values are available at the respective outputs."
