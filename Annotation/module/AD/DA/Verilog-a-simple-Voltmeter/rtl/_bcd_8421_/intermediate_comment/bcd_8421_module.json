    "module": "Module-level comment: The bcd_8421 module converts a 20-bit binary input to a BCD format utilizing a shift-and-add-3 algorithm synchronized with a system clock. It operates through a series of conditional additions and shifts controlled by internal counters (`cnt_shift`), a shift register (`data_shift`), and a toggle flag (`shift_flag`), outputting the BCD representation across six 4-bit outputs for decimal places ranging from units to hundred thousands."
