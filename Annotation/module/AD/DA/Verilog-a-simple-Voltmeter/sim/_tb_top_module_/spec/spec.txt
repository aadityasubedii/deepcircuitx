Module name: tb_top_module. Module specification: The tb_top_module is a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of another module named 'top_module', focusing on simulating various operational conditions. The module employs a primary system clock (`sys_clk`) to drive the sequential logic of `top_module`, and an active-low system reset (`sys_rst_n`) to manage the initialization state. Inputs include `ad_data` signal for providing analog-to-digital data conditions, which `top_module` processes. Output ports consist of `sel`, `seg`, and `ad_clk` which could be connected to multiplex display lines, display segments, and provide synchronization for ADC operations, respectively. Internal signals like `clk_sample` control the sampling rate at which data is updated, `data_en` flag controls data processing on or off states, and `ad_data_reg` holds the incoming data values for processing. The main code blocks include initialization of clocks, the data generation mechanism, and conditional data processing based on reset and enable signals, providing a clear operational timeline for test scenarios simulated within the testbench.
