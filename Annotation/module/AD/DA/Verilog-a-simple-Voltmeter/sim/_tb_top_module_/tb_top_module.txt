Module-level comment: The `tb_top_module` serves as a testbench for `top_module`, generating necessary clocks (`sys_clk`, `clk_sample`), and simulating reset (`sys_rst_n`) and data conditions (`ad_data`) for validation. It manages internal timing, data generation, and conditionally processes inputs through `data_en` and `ad_data_reg` to mimic real scenarios, thereby facilitating comprehensive testing of `top_module` functionalities.
