    "spec": "Module name: tb_top_module. Module specification: The tb_top_module is a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of another module named 'top_module', focusing on simulating various operational conditions. The module employs a primary system clock (`sys_clk`) to drive the sequential logic of `top_module`, and an active-low system reset (`sys_rst_n`) to manage the initialization state. Inputs include `ad_data` signal for providing analog-to-digital data conditions, which `top_module` processes. Output ports consist of `sel`, `seg`, and `ad_clk` which could be connected to multiplex display lines, display segments, and provide synchronization for ADC operations, respectively. Internal signals like `clk_sample` control the sampling rate at which data is updated, `data_en` flag controls data processing on or off states, and `ad_data_reg` holds the incoming data values for processing. The main code blocks include initialization of clocks, the data generation mechanism, and conditional data processing based on reset and enable signals, providing a clear operational timeline for test scenarios simulated within the testbench.",

Its role is to control the timing at which `ad_data` starts being incremented or held at a specific value (`8'd125`) within the testbench. By toggling this flag, the testbench can simulate different operational stages of the `top_module`, such as periods when new data is or is not being received.\n- `ad_data_reg`: This register holds the simulated analog-to-digital converted data values that are to be processed by the `top_module`. It is incremented every time the `clk_sample` signal goes high, provided that `sys_rst_n` is high (indicating the system is not in reset) and `data_en` is high (indicating that new data should be generated).
