Its role is to control the timing at which `ad_data` starts being incremented or held at a specific value (`8'd125`) within the testbench. By toggling this flag, the testbench can simulate different operational stages of the `top_module`, such as periods when new data is or is not being received.\n- `ad_data_reg`: This register holds the simulated analog-to-digital converted data values that are to be processed by the `top_module`. It is incremented every time the `clk_sample` signal goes high, provided that `sys_rst_n` is high (indicating the system is not in reset) and `data_en` is high (indicating that new data should be generated).
