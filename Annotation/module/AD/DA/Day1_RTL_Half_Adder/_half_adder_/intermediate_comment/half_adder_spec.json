It accepts two input ports named 'a' and 'b', where 'a' and 'b' represent the binary numbers to be added. The module produces two outputs, 'sum' and 'carry'. The 'sum' output is calculated using the XOR operation between 'a' and 'b', which results in the least significant bit of the addition, and the 'carry' output is obtained by performing the AND operation on the same inputs, providing the most significant bit that would carry over to the next bit position in an extended adder configuration. This module does not use any internal signals, as it directly assigns results of the operations to the outputs using 'assign' statements. There are no additional internal blocks or sections; the module directly computes the outputs from inputs without intermediate processes or storage, making the design straightforward and efficient.",
