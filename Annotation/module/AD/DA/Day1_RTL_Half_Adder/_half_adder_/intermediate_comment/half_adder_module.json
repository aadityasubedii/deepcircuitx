    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'halfadder' module performs single-bit binary addition, generating 'sum' through an XOR of inputs 'a' and 'b', and 'carry' via an AND of the inputs. Direct 'assign' statements yield the outputs without intermediate signals, ensuring simplicity and efficiency."
