Module name: tb. Module specification: The `tb` module is designed as a testbench for verifying the functionality of a half adder circuit, designated as `halfadder`, by simulating its operation under various input conditions. The module utilizes two single-bit input ports: `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` serve as the binary digits to be added. The outputs include two single-bit ports: `sum` and `carry`. The `sum` output represents the simple binary addition of `a` and `b` without carry processing, while `carry` indicates a carry out, suggesting an overflow to the next significant bit. Internal to the module, `sum` and `carry` are implemented as wires that connect the outputs of the instantiated half adder (`ha_dut`) to both the monitoring and VCD dumping mechanisms. In the first code block, the module cycles through all possible combinations of inputs `(00, 01, 10, 11)`, each maintained for 10ns, to extensively test all scenarios. The second code block includes a `$monitor` statement to output the values of `a`, `b`, `sum`, and `carry` at each simulation timestep, and initializes VCD logging to facilitate further analysis and debugging using tools that support VCD files. This comprehensive setup ensures that the half adderâ€™s design and functionality are thoroughly validated under test conditions.
