    "module": "Module-level comment: The `tb` module serves as a testbench for a half adder (`halfadder`). It tests the adder's response to all input combinations (`00`, `01`, `10`, `11`) by toggling inputs `a` and `b` every 10ns. Outputs `sum` and `carry` are monitored and saved to a VCD file for analysis, ensuring thorough functionality verification of the half adder under simulated conditions."
