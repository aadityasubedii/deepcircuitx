Module name: fulladder_tb.
Module specification: The "fulladder_tb" is a testbench module designed to verify the operation of a full adder circuit. Its functionality includes initializing and manipulating test vectors (combinations of inputs) which are applied to a full adder instance referenced as the Design Under Test (DUT). The input ports for this module are 'a', 'b', and 'cin', serving as the operands and the carry-in bit, respectively, for the addition operation that the full adder is meant to perform. The output ports are 'sum', which represents the resultant sum bit of the addition, and 'c_out', the carry-out bit that can be utilized as carry-in for an adjacent higher-order bit addition in multi-bit adder configurations. This testbench does not include any internal signals, as it directly interfaces with the DUT without additional internal logic. The testbench sequences through various combinations of input stimuli using a series of time-delayed assignments to validate the full adder logic under different scenarios. In sum, the verbatim code within "fulladder_tb" strategically toggles the input conditions and observes the corresponding outputs to ensure the full adder's proper operation.
