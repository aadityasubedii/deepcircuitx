    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"fulladder_tb\" module serves as a testbench for verifying a full adder's functionality, systematically testing all possible input states. This simulation-driven module initializes inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin', then cycles through all input permutations with time delays to ensure the full adder instance (DUT) produces correct 'sum' and 'carry-out' for each case."
