Module-level comment: The `fulladder` module computes the sum and carry-out of three input bits (a, b, cin). It utilizes two XOR gates for the sum calculation and two AND gates followed by an OR gate for the carry-out. The intermediate signals (O1, O2, O3) connect these gates, where O1 results from the first XOR (inputs 'a', 'b'), and contributes to both the second XOR (with 'cin' for 'sum') and an AND gate (with 'cin' for 'c_out'). O2 and O3 (outputs from AND gates) feed into the OR gate, which correctly computes 'c_out'.
