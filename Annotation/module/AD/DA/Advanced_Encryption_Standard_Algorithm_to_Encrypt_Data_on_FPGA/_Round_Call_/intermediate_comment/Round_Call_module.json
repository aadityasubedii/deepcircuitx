    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"Round_Call\" module conducts a single encryption round, crucial for algorithms like AES. It accepts a 128-bit data input (`din`), a 4-bit round count (`roundcount`), and a 128-bit key input (`kin`), producing a transformed data (`roundout`) and key (`kout`). Internally, it sequences through key generation, byte substitution, row shifting, and column mixing, culminating in `roundout` via XORing `outcol` with `kout`. This structured process ensures efficient and secure data encryption in each round."
