Module name: Test_Encrypt. Module specification: Test_Encrypt is a Verilog module designed specifically to verify the functionality of AES encryption in a digital circuit. This module functions by instantiating the AES_Encrypt module and providing it with necessary control and data signals. The Test_Encrypt module has two key ports: `clock` as an input signal and `finaloutput` as an output signal. The `clock` input, defined as a `reg` type inside the module, serves as a synchronization signal for the operations of the AES_Encrypt submodule. The `finaloutput`, defined as a `wire`, carries the 128-bit encrypted output result generated by the AES_Encrypt submodule. Internally, the module has a clock signal that toggles to orchestrate the timing for encryption processes. The key component of the Test_Encrypt module is the AES_Encrypt instantiation which is connected with a constant data input (`din`) of 128'h54776f204f6e65204e696e652054776f, a key (`k`) of 128'h5468617473206d79204b756e67204675, and the `finaloutput` for the encrypted data. The module specifies an `initial` block that initializes the clock signal to low and includes a delay to simulate clocking behavior. This setup effectively demonstrates how data is processed and encrypted utilizing specified test vectors in a controlled test environment.
