Module-level comment: The AES_Encrypt module performs 128-bit AES encryption on plaintext data using a 128-bit key, through 10 rounds of processing. It initializes with an XOR of input data and key, followed by nine iterative Round_Call modules for rounds one to nine, and a final Round_Call_Last for the last round, outputting encrypted data.
