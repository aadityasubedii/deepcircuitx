It sequentially processes the data through multiple encryption rounds (10 in total, including the last round handled separately), each manipulating the data using the AES algorithm's round function. The initial data is XORed with the key, and each subsequent round takes the output of the previous round as its input. Each round generates a new round key used for the next round's operations, leading to a final encrypted output (dout) after the last round."
