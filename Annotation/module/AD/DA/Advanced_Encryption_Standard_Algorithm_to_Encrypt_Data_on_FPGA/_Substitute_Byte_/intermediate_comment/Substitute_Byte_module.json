    "module": "Module-level comment: The Substitute_Byte module applies byte-level substitution to a 128-bit input data, outputting a transformed 128-bit vector 'sb'. This is achieved using 16 S_Box instances, each taking an 8-bit slice of 'data' and emitting a substituted 8-bit slice to form 'sb', reflecting a byte-wise substitution typical in cryptographic operations, such as AES."
