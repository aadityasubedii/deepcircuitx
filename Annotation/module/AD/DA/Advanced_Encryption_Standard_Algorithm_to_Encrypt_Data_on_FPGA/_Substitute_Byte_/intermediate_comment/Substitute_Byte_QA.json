It divides the input data into 16 segments, each of 8 bits. Each 8-bit segment of data is independently processed by an S_Box module, presumably performing a substitution operation based on some predefined look-up table or function inside the S_Box module. This is typical in cryptographic operations such as those used in AES, where byte substitution is a fundamental part of the encryption process.
