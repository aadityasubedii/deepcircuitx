It generates a new 128-bit output key (`kout`) from a 128-bit input key (`kin`) and a 4-bit round constant (`rc`). The module splits `kin` into four 32-bit segments labeled as `word0` to `word3`, processes `word3` through an S-Box transformation, and produces `kout` through a series of XOR operations involving the round constant expanded to 32 bits (`rcout`). The input ports are: `rc`, a 4-bit round constant critical in cryptographic transformations, and `kin`, a 128-bit input key. The output port `kout` is a 128-bit key used in subsequent rounds of AES operations. Internal signals include `word0` to `word3` for splitting the input key, `rcout` for the expanded round constant, and `temp` holding the S-Box processed result of `word3`. The module incorporates a `roundconst` block which expands `rc` into `rcout` and four instances of `S_Box` modules for byte-wise S-Box transformation on `word3`. Detailed XOR operations are employed to compute each segment of `kout` using a combinational logic that incorporates previous outputs for accumulating transformations necessary for the AES key scheduling.",

They are essential for the word-based operations of the key expansion.

The S-Box is a substitution step where each byte of `word3` is independently replaced with another byte from a fixed 256-byte table. The S-Box lookup is performed using instances of an S_Box module where `temp` holds the results.
