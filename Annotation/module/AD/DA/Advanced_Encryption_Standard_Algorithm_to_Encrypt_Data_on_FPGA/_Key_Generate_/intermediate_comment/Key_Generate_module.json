    "module": "Module-level comment: The Key_Generate module performs key transformation for AES cryptographic operations, generating a new 128-bit key from an input key and a round constant. It divides the input key into four words, processes one through an S-Box, and leverages XOR operations with the expanded round constant to produce the output key. Internal structures include word division, S-Box processing, and a round constant expansion module."
