It operates by splitting the input key into four words, processing the fourth word through an S-Box, and then generating the output key through a series of XOR operations with the round constant.

They are essential for the word-based operations of the key expansion. Each word is a quarter of the input key with `word0` being the most significant and `word3` being the least significant.\n  \n- `rcout`: This is a 32-bit internal wire signal that stores the output of the `roundconst` module which expands the 4-bit round constant input (`rc`) into a 32-bit word to be used in XOR operations of the key generation process.\n  \n- `temp`: This is a 32-bit internal wire signal that temporarily stores the transformed version of `word3` after it is processed through an S-Box. The S-Box is a substitution step where each byte of `word3` is independently replaced with another byte from a fixed 256-byte table.
