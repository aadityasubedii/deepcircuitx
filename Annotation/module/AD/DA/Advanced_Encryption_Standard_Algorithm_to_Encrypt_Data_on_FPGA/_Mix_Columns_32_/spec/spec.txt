Module name: Mix_Columns_32.

Module specification: The Mix_Columns_32 module implements the MixColumns transformation, an integral component of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption algorithm, designed to enhance security by increasing the diffusion of input bytes. It accepts four 8-bit input vectors, `in1`, `in2`, `in3`, and `in4`, which correspond to a single column of the AES state matrix, with each byte representing an element to be processed through the MixColumns operation. The module produces a single 8-bit output vector `mixcolumns32` that embodies the transformation results, with each output bit being a calculated function of multiple input bits, generated by a series of XOR logical operations. There are no internal signals declared within the module, as the output bits are calculated directly using bitwise XOR assignments involving specific bits from each input vector. The code is organized into sequential assignment statements for each bit of the output vector `mixcolumns32`, with the index [7] down to [0] corresponding to the resulting bits from the top down. Each assignment statement constructs one bit of the output through XOR operations of selected bits from the input vectors, thereby adhering to the MixColumns transformation's requirements for producing a well-diffused output vector that strengthens the overall security of the AES encryption algorithm.
