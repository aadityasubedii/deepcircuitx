The purpose of this module is to perform the \"MixColumns\" transformation, which is a critical step in the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption process. This transformation operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column. The output is a new value for each byte in which the result of the byte is a function of all four bytes in the input column. This transformation increases the diffusion of the input bytes, thereby contributing to the security of the encryption algorithm. Each bit in the output is calculated by a specific logic operation (XOR) which involves bits from all input bytes, though with a bit-level shift arrangement, thus ensuring that each output bit depends on multiple input bits."

The output vector `mixcolumns32` is constructed bitwise, with each bit being the result of XOR operations on certain bits of all four input vectors.
