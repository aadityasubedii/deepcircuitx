This transformation is typical in cryptographic algorithms like AES for the \"ShiftRows\" step. Each row of 8-bits within the state is cyclically shifted by different offsets. The first row remains unchanged, and each subsequent row is shifted with varying offsets, effectively permuting the bits across these rows. This is commonly used to increase the diffusion of the input data in cryptographic contexts."
