    "spec": "Module name: Shift_Rows. \nModule specification: The `Shift_Rows` module in Verilog is designed to perform the \"ShiftRows\" transformation which is a critical step in AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cryptographic algorithm. The module takes a 128-bit input vector through an input port named `istate`, conceptualized as a 4x4 matrix where each row consists of 8 bits representing a byte, and outputs a 128-bit vector `ostate`. The `ostate` is the result of the \"ShiftRows\" operation where the first row is left unchanged, the second row is shifted left by one byte, the third row by two bytes, and the fourth row by three bytes. There are no internal signals declared in the module, indicating that the row shifting operation is performed through direct assignment from `istate` to `ostate`. The Verilog code has clearly demarcated sections for assigning each row of `ostate` by appropriately selecting and shifting the corresponding bits from `istate`. Specifically, the first set of assignments maintains the first row unchanged, while subsequent sets of assignments handle the three remaining rows with their respective byte shifts. The module exhibits purely combinatorial behavior as there are no storage elements like registers or memory.

This transformation is typical in cryptographic algorithms like AES for the \"ShiftRows\" step. Each row of 8-bits within the state is cyclically shifted by different offsets. The first row remains unchanged, and each subsequent row is shifted with varying offsets, effectively permuting the bits across these rows.
