It takes an 8-bit input 'a' and outputs an 8-bit result 'c'. The output is determined by a lookup operation where the input 'a' serves as an index to fetch the corresponding 8-bit output value from a predefined set of values defined by a series of case statements. Each possible input value from 0x00 to 0xFF maps to a specific output value, which is essential for cryptographic transformations in encryption processes."

This input is used to map to the corresponding output based on encrypted or transformational requirements in cryptographic processes.\n\nOutput ports: [c]. Explanation: The output port 'c' is an 8-bit wide output that provides the result from the S-Box lookup corresponding to the input 'a'. The value of 'c' is determined by a predefined set of values, each associated with a potential input.
