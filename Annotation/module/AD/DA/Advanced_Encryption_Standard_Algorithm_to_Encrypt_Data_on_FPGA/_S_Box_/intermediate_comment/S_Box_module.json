    "module": "Module-level comment: The S_Box module implements an 8-bit substitution box (S-Box) for encryption algorithms. It maps an 8-bit input 'a' to a transformed 8-bit output 'c' using a case-based lookup table. Triggered by input changes, the always block updates the 'c' register with the lookup result, ensuring each input byte is substituted according to a predefined cryptographic pattern."
