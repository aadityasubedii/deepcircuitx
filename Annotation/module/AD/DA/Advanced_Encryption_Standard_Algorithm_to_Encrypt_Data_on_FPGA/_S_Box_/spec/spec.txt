Module name: S_Box.
Module specification: The S_Box module is designed to implement a Substitution box (S-Box), a critical component in cryptographic algorithms which performs non-linear byte substitution, aiding in the complexity and security of encryption methodologies. This module takes an 8-bit input 'a' and provides an 8-bit output 'c'. The input 'a' serves as an index to a substitution lookup table defined by a series of case statements, effectively mapping each of the possible byte values (0x00 to 0xFF) to a unique and predetermined output byte under cryptographic principles. The module consists of an input port [a], which accepts the 8-bit value for substitution, and an output port [c], which delivers the substituted 8-bit value post processing. Internally, the module uses a register also named 'c', functioning as storage for the output value until a new substitution is triggered by a change in the input. The main body of the module contains an 'always' block that executes the substitution logic: it responds to changes in the 'a' input, selecting the proper output from the lookup table using a case statement that correlates input values to their encrypted outputs, which are then assigned to the 'c' register.
