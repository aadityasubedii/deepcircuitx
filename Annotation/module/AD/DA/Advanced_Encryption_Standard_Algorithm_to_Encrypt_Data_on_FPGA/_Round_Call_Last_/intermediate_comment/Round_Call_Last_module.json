    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'Round_Call_Last' module performs a single round of encryption, akin to AES algorithms. It inputs 128-bit data and key, and a 4-bit round count, outputting encrypted data. Internally, it utilizes 'Key_Generate' for round-specific key derivation, 'Substitute_Byte' for byte substitution, and 'Shift_Rows' for data reordering, culminating in an XOR operation for the final output."
