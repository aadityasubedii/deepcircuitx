Module name: Round_Call_Last. 
Module specification: The 'Round_Call_Last' module is designed primarily for use in cryptographic algorithms, performing a single round of encryption similar to those found in AES. The module takes a 128-bit data input (`din`), a 128-bit key input (`kin`), and a 4-bit round count (`roundcount`) as input parameters and outputs a 128-bit encrypted data (`roundout`). The operations are synchronized under a `clock` input, crucial for maintaining timing across multiple encryption stages though not explicitly used within the module's code snapshot. Internally, the module utilizes three primary signals: `sbout`, `outstate`, and `kout`. These handle the byte substitution output, the row-shifted state, and the round-specific key output, respectively. The module encompasses three sub-modules/functions: `Key_Generate` which derives a round-specific key based on the input key and round count, `Substitute_Byte` which performs byte-level substitutions on the input data, and `Shift_Rows` which re-configures the byte order of the substituted data (`sbout`). The final encrypted output (`roundout`) is produced by XOR-ing the `outstate` (output from `Shift_Rows`) with `kout` (output from `Key_Generate`). This architecture provides a structured approach to data encryption, aligning with common practices in advanced cryptographic standards.
