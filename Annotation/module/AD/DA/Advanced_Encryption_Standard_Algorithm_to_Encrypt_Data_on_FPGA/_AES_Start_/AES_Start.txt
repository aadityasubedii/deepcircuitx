Module-level comment: The AES_Start module performs AES encryption by utilizing the AES_Encrypt submodule. It receives a clock signal as input and outputs the least significant 16 bits of the encrypted data. Internally, it employs a 128-bit `tempout` wire for holding the full encrypted output from AES_Encrypt, configured with fixed inputs, and only exposes a 16-bit fragment as `finaloutput`.
