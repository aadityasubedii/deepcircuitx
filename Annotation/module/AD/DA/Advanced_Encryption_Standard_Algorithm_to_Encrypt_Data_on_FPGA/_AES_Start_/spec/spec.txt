Module name: AES_Start. 
Module specification: The AES_Start is a top-level Verilog module responsible for performing AES encryption using a submodule named AES_Encrypt. The module features a single input port `clock` which is essential for providing the clock signal to synchronize the encryption operations within the AES_Encrypt submodule. It exposes one output port `finaloutput`, a 16-bit signal representing the least significant 16 bits of the encrypted data. Internally, the module utilizes a 128-bit wide wire `tempout` to store the complete encrypted output from the AES_Encrypt submodule. This wire handles the raw encryption data, with only the least significant 16 bits being routed to the `finaloutput` port for external use. The implanted submodule AES_Encrypt, referenced as `v1`, is configured with a fixed 128-bit plaintext and a 128-bit key. It processes the encryption and outputs the data to `tempout`. The selective external exposure of the encryption result, achieved by assigning only a portion of `tempout` to `finaloutput`, is a critical aspect of the design, ensuring restricted access to the full encrypted data.
