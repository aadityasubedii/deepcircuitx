Module-level comment: The 'roundconst' module generates 32-bit constants for cryptographic applications based on a 4-bit input 'rc'. It stores the result in an internal 32-bit register 'rcout', which is continuously assigned to the output port 'rocout'. Constants are selected within an 'always' block using conditional statements that map 'rc' to predefined constants essential for encryption key expansion.
