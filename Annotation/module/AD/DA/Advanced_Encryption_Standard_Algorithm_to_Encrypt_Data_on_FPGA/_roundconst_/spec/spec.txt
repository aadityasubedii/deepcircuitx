Module name: roundconst.

Module specification: The `roundconst` module is a digital hardware component designed to generate predefined 32-bit constants based on a 4-bit input, commonly used in cryptographic algorithms such as AES for key expansion. The module has a single input port `rc`, which is a 4-bit selector that determines the output constant. The output port `rocout` is a 32-bit bus which provides the resulted round constant to be used in subsequent stages of cryptographic transformations. Internally, the module employs a 32-bit register `rcout`, which serves the purpose of storing the computed constant based on the input `rc` until it's assigned to the output port through continuous assignment. The uniqueness of this module lies in its combinational `always` block that contains a series of conditional statements (if-else) to evaluate the proper constant corresponding to the input selection. This block ensures that `rcout` is updated every time `rc` changes, and the continuous assignment outside the `always` block directly maps this internal signal to the output port, ensuring a stable output is provided. The structure of the `roundconst` module is straightforward and efficient, designed specifically to fulfill the role of providing round constants in a secure and deterministic manner for cryptographic routines.
