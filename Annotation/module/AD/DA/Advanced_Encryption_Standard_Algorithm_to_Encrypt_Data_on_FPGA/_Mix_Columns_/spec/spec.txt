Module name: Mix_Columns. 
Module specification: The Mix_Columns module is designed for performing a crucial operation in the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm, known as the mix columns operation. This module processes a 128-bit input block (`a`) and produces a 128-bit output block (`out`), effectively transforming each column of the state according to AES specifications. The input to this module, `[127:0] a`, is a 128-bit wide bus that serves as the state to be transformed, coming after the SubBytes and ShiftRows steps in AES. The output, `[127:0] out`, also a 128-bit bus, represents the transformed state ready for further encryption rounds or final processing. Internally, the module lacks explicitly declared signals but works by directly slicing and dicing the `a` and `out` buses to connect with four instances (v1 to v16, based on the section of the input block) of the Mix_Columns_32 submodules. These submodules are tasked with processing 32-bit sections of the input block by rotating and mixing the bytes among each other, as per the AES mix columns transformation process. The code is structured into four segments, each catering to a quarter of the 128-bit input block, where successive instances of Mix_Columns_32 (e.g., v16 to v13 for the first quarter) are called in parallel to handle different 32-bit slices. This design ensures increased diffusion in the encryption algorithm, enhancing its security by thoroughly mixing the data across the columns of the input state.
