    "module": "Module-level comment: The Mix_Columns module executes the mix columns operation for AES, transforming a 128-bit block. It divides the input into four 32-bit sections, processed by parallel instances of Mix_Columns_32. These submodules mix bytes according to AES specifications, yielding a combined 128-bit output, enhancing encryption diffusion."
