Module name: Add_Round_Key.

Module specification: The "Add_Round_Key" module is conceptualized to be a part of a cryptographic system, presumably for integrating a round key into the encryption state, commonly found in algorithms such as AES. However, the provided Verilog code lacks implementation and thus, from the code alone, no functionality can be determined. The module would theoretically have input ports `state` and `round_key`, which are likely 128-bit vectors to accommodate a typical AES state and key size, and an output port `new_state`, also a 128-bit vector representing the transformed state after adding (typically XORing) the round key. The module would conceivably use an internal signal, hypothetically named `temp_state` or `xor_result`, to store intermediary computation results. The internal structure of the module is not delineated due to the absence of any actual code blocks, leading to the incapacity to specify different blocks or sections within the code. Therefore, the operational specifics remain undefined until a complete implementation is provided.
