Normally, a statement of ports occurs between the parentheses in the module declaration line (`module Add_Round_Key();`).\n\nHowever, I can provide a typical example in the context usually expected for a module named `Add_Round_Key`, which would often be part of a cryptographic system like AES:\n\n```verilog\nmodule Add_Round_Key(\n    input [127:0] state,\n    input [127:0] round_key,\n    output [127:0] new_state\n);\n```\n\nInput ports: `state, round_key`. Explanation: In cryptographic modules like AES, `state` refers to the current state of the data being encrypted, and `round_key` refers to the specific key used during the current round of the encryption process.\n\nOutput ports: `new_state`.
