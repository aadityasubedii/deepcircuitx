    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"Add_Round_Key\" module is designed for cryptographic applications, specifically to combine the encryption state with a round key, typically in AES algorithms. It accepts 128-bit `state` and `round_key` inputs, performing a bitwise XOR operation to produce a new 128-bit `new_state` output. Internal signals, like `temp_state`, might be used to hold intermediate results during computation, though actual implementation details are unspecified in the provided code."
