Module-level comment: The data_decoder module encodes eight 5-bit characters to a 72-bit output, mapping each character to a 9-bit value based on predefined rules, with special cases for '5'h1F', '5'h1E', and '5'h1D'. It utilizes an 8-bit 'point' input to modify encoded outputs per character. Internally, it uses an array 'ichar' for input organization and a 'data_buf' for intermediate storage, employing a generate loop with case statements for scalable parallel encoding.
