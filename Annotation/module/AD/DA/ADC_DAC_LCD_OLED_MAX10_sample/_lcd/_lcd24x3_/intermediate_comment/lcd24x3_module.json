    "module": "Module-level comment: The `lcd24x3` module controls a 24x3 LCD display, translating 8 character inputs and special indicators into displayable segment and common line signals. Utilizes internal counters and a `data_decoder` submodule for character decoding, contrast management, and multiplexing control. Outputs are dynamically adjusted based on the internal `shift` signal for contrast and multiplexing efficiency."
