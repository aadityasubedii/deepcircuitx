    "spec": "Module name: lcd24x3.\n\nModule specification: The `lcd24x3` module is designed for controlling a 24x3 LCD display by receiving character data and displaying it appropriately. It synchronizes operations using an input clock signal (`clk`) and accepts eight 5-bit character inputs (`iChar7` to `iChar0`) to represent characters on the display. Additionally, an 8-bit input (`iPoint`) manages special indicators like decimal points. It outputs a 3-bit control signal (`oCom`) for common line selection and a 24-bit segment signal (`oSeg`) to drive the individual segments of the LCD. \n\nInternal signals include the 72-bit `segin`, which stores decoded segment information, `fcom` (a 4-bit register) for controlling the common lines' multiplexing, `fseg` (a 24-bit register) for the segment signals, `shift` (a register) that toggles to manage the contrast, `fbcnt` (a 5-bit counter) for regulating frame periods with reference to contrast settings, `fbclk` (a clock signal) derived from the main clock for timing multiplexing, and `cnt` (a 15-bit counter) used as a clock divider. \n\nThe module features several blocks:\n1. A clock divider that toggles `fbclk` according to the provided frequency.\n2. A contrast management block toggling `shift` based on contrast settings using `fbcnt`.\n3. A multiplex control block setting `fcom` using a frame buffer counter to cycle through the display rows.\n4. A segment control block within a `generate` construct defining the `fseg` based on the `segin` data and multiplex signals.\n5. An output assignment block that conditions the output control signals `oCom` and `oSeg` on the `shift` signal's status.\n6. A sub-module instantiation (`data_decoder`) which decodes the character inputs (`iChar[x]`) into the control signals for segments (`segin`).\n\nThe module encapsulates the LCD driving logic clearly and effectively, operating the display through internal timing and decoding mechanisms.",

The module takes an input clock signal (`clk`) and eight 5-bit character inputs (`iChar7` to `iChar0`), as well as an 8-bit `iPoint` input which could be used for setting decimal points or special characters on the display. It outputs a 3-bit control signal (`oCom`) and a 24-bit segment signal (`oSeg`) to drive the display.\n\nThe module defines parameters for the clock frequency (`Fclk`) and contrast level (`Contrast`). The comportment of the display is handled by manipulating a counter `cnt` that gets incremented every positive edge of the input clock until it reaches a specific value, at which point it toggles a slower clock signal `fbclk`. Also, there is a frame buffer count `fbcnt`, which seems to control the contrast and update frequency of the display data, toggling the `shift` signal once the count exceeds a value that includes the `Contrast`.\n\nThe combination of `fbclk` and `fbcnt` appears to determine the timing for multiplexing the display data (`fcom` for common lines and `fseg` for segment lines), which are then conditionally inverted based on the `shift` signal before being assigned to the module\u2019s outputs (`oCom` and `oSeg`).\n\nThere is a `generate` block that creates logic for each of the 24 segments; the resulting `fseg` signals seem to be derived based on a combination of the `fcom` signal and three bits from the `segin` signal for each segment.\n\nLastly, the module instantiates a `data_decoder` sub-module named `DATA_DECODER` that is likely to decode the character input to drive the correct segments (`segin`). The actual decoding logic is not shown in the given code."

Each port carries the binary code for a character.\n- iPoint: This is an 8-bit input signal representing decimal points or special indicator statuses on the LCD.\n\nExplanation: \n- The `clk` input provides the timing reference for the entire module, driving the internal counters and state machines.\n- The 5-bit character inputs `iChar7` to `iChar0` represent individual characters to be displayed on the LCD. The encoding for each character is dependent on how the data_decoder (not part of this source code) translates character codes into segment control signals.\n- The `iPoint` input likely enables control over additional segments such as decimal points or other special features on each of the 8 character positions on the LCD.\n\nOutput ports:\n- oCom: A 3-bit output signal that controls the common lines of the LCD, likely selecting which of the LCD's rows are active at a given moment.\n- oSeg: A 24-bit output signal that controls the individual segments of the LCD. \n\nExplanation:\n- The `oCom` output is used to multiplex the common lines (com) of the display. It is determined by the internal `fcom` signal and modified by the `shift` signal.\n- The `oSeg` output drives the segments (seg) of the display, and its value is derived from the internal `fseg` signal and also modified by the `shift` signal.

It synchronizes operations using an input clock signal (`clk`) and accepts eight 5-bit character inputs (`iChar7` to `iChar0`) to represent characters on the display. Additionally, an 8-bit input (`iPoint`) manages special indicators like decimal points. It outputs a 3-bit control signal (`oCom`) for common line selection and a 24-bit segment signal (`oSeg`) to drive the individual segments of the LCD. \n\nInternal signals include the 72-bit `segin`, which stores decoded segment information, `fcom` (a 4-bit register) for controlling the common lines' multiplexing, `fseg` (a 24-bit register) for the segment signals, `shift` (a register) that toggles to manage the contrast, `fbcnt` (a 5-bit counter) for regulating frame periods with reference to contrast settings, `fbclk` (a clock signal) derived from the main clock for timing multiplexing, and `cnt` (a 15-bit counter) used as a clock divider. \n\nThe module features several blocks:\n1. A clock divider that toggles `fbclk` according to the provided frequency.\n2. A contrast management block toggling `shift` based on contrast settings using `fbcnt`.\n3. A multiplex control block setting `fcom` using a frame buffer counter to cycle through the display rows.\n4. A segment control block within a `generate` construct defining the `fseg` based on the `segin` data and multiplex signals.\n5. An output assignment block that conditions the output control signals `oCom` and `oSeg` on the `shift` signal's status.\n6. A sub-module instantiation (`data_decoder`) which decodes the character inputs (`iChar[x]`) into the control signals for segments (`segin`).\n\nThe module encapsulates the LCD driving logic clearly and effectively, operating the display through internal timing and decoding mechanisms."
