    "module": "Module-level comment: The `delay` module detects falling edges on the `pin` input and initiates a counter `tcnt` which increments on each clock `clk` cycle. The counter width is parameterized by `N`. On a falling edge, `tcnt` resets and `pout` is set to 0. When `tcnt` fully increments, `pout` switches to 1, signaling a completed delay period. This cycle repeats, effectively measuring intervals by clock cycles post each detected falling edge."
