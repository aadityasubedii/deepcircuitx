    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'adc' module interfaces with an Analog-to-Digital Converter, managing ADC-specific operations and command handling. It accepts primary and ADC-specific clocks, a reset signal, and command inputs that dictate the channel and packet framing. The module outputs the readiness for new commands and the validity of the response data along with the data itself, framed in packets. While the internal logic handling these operations isn't detailed in the snippet, it suggests a structure that could include state machines and buffers to manage data flow and command processing."
