Module name: adc. Module specification: The 'adc' module interfaces with an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), handling the necessary signal processing and communication protocols. It includes various input ports: `clock_clk` for the primary clock signal, `reset_sink_reset_n` as an active-low reset, `adc_pll_clock_clk` for the ADC-specific clock, `adc_pll_locked_export` indicating PLL stability, `command_valid` to mark command validity, and `command_channel` to specify the ADC channel. Additional inputs are `command_startofpacket` and `command_endofpacket` for framing command packets. The output ports include `command_ready` that shows the ADC module's readiness to accept commands, `response_valid` for data validity, `response_channel` for the channel of the response, `response_data` with the converted digital data, and `response_startofpacket` and `response_endofpacket` for response data packet framing. Although the provided Verilog code snippet does not explicitly declare any internal signals such as registers or state machines, it implies a design that could include such elements for managing ADC data sampling and communication protocol states. The code primarily defines the structural framework of the module with its interface, but the core functionality and internal logic blocks, like signal processing, state transitions, or data buffering, are not visible in this snippet.
