    "spec": "Module name: adc. \nModule specification: The 'adc' module is a Verilog RTL design that serves as an Analog-to-Digital Converter interface. It operates on a primary clock signal 'clock_clk' for synchronization and an optional 'adc_pll_clock_clk' which is likely tied to a clock generated by a PLL within the module. The module can be reset by an active low 'reset_sink_reset_n' signal. Commands for ADC operations are received when 'command_valid' is asserted, with specificity provided for channels ('command_channel'), and packet boundaries indicated by 'command_startofpacket' and 'command_endofpacket'. Outputs include 'adc_pll_locked_export' which confirms PLL lock status, 'command_ready' to signal the ability to receive a new command, and 'response_valid' along with 'response_channel', 'response_data', 'response_startofpacket', and 'response_endofpacket' to provide ADC conversion results structured within data packets. \n\nInternal signals such as 'adc_data', 'adc_busy', 'adc_error', and 'sample_ready' might be presumed based on common ADC design practices, but are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet. 'adc_data' would store conversion results, 'adc_busy' would indicate operational status, 'adc_error' could indicate any conversion errors, and 'sample_ready' would flag data readiness. \n\nThe specific code blocks or sections cannot be outlined as the provided snippet only contains the instance declaration of the 'adc' module with no additional structural details. However, one can expect the module to include components for signal conditioning, data conversion, control logic, error monitoring, and interface management to handle the aforementioned inputs and outputs to perform analog-to-digital conversion operations.",
