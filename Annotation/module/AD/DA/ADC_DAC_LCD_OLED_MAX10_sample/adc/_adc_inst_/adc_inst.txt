Module-level comment: The 'adc' module interfaces with an analog-to-digital converter, synchronizing via 'clock_clk' and 'adc_pll_clock_clk', and resetting through 'reset_sink_reset_n'. It manages ADC commands using inputs 'command_*', signals readiness to accept commands and provides conversion results via 'response_*' outputs. Internal implementation likely entails signal processing, conversion control, and error handling to execute ADC functionalities efficiently.
