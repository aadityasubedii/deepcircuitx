It manages the ADC's operation, including power-down, power-up, channel selection, conversion, and result handling. The FSM coordinates the ADC's sampling process, handles command inputs, generates control signals, and provides response outputs. It also supports features like averaging for temperature sensing and dual ADC mode synchronization. The module controls the ADC's behavior through various states, manages timing, and ensures proper sequencing of ADC operations."
