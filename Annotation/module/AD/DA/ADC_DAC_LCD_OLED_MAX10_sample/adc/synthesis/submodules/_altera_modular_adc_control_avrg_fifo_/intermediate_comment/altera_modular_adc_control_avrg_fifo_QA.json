It manages data entries and exits using parameters like clock signals, data inputs, and control flags for reading and writing. Conditions such as buffer fullness or emptiness are monitored and flagged, facilitating data flow control in digital signal processing applications. The module utilizes configuration parameters to set up the FIFO's characteristics such as memory type and size."
