Module name: altera_modular_adc_control_fsm. Module specification: This module is a finite state machine (FSM) controller for an Altera modular ADC, managing the ADC's operation including power-down, power-up, channel selection, conversion, and result handling. It has input ports for clock (clk), reset (rst_n), PLL lock status (clk_in_pll_locked), command signals (cmd_valid, cmd_channel, cmd_sop, cmd_eop), DFT clock (clk_dft), end of conversion (eoc), ADC data output (dout), and synchronization ready signal (sync_ready). Output ports include response signals (rsp_valid, rsp_channel, rsp_data, rsp_sop, rsp_eop), command ready (cmd_ready), channel select (chsel),
