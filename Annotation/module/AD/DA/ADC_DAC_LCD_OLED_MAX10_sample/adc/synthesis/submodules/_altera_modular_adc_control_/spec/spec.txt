Module name: altera_modular_adc_control. Module specification: The 'altera_modular_adc_control' module is designed for controlling an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) on an Altera FPGA, handling ADC configuration, start-of-conversion processes, and interfacing for command and response transactions. It includes input ports such as `clk` (main clock), `rst_n` (reset), `clk_in_pll_c0` (PLL clock input for ADC timing), and various command-related signals like `cmd_valid` (valid command indicator), along with outputs `cmd_ready` (ready to receive command) and `rsp_data` (ADC conversion results). Important internal signals include `clkout_adccore` (ADC core clock), `soc` (start of conversion trigger), and `eoc` (end of conversion indicator). The module is structured around two key instantiated blocks: 'altera_modular_adc_control_fsm' handling the Finite State Machine for command processing, and 'fiftyfivenm_adcblock_top_wrapper' which encapsulates the lower-level ADC operations. This structure enables efficient command handling, synchronization of data, and power management within the FPGA environment while accommodating various customization parameters for tailored functionality in different use cases.
