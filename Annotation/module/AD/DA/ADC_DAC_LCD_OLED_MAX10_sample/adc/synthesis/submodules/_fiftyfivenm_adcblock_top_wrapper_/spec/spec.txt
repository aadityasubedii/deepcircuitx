Module name: fiftyfivenm_adcblock_top_wrapper. 

Module specification: The `fiftyfivenm_adcblock_top_wrapper` module is designed to interface with a 55 nm Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) block, serving as a wrapper to integrate the ADC into a larger system design. The module accepts a clock input (`clkin_from_pll_c0`) from a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to synchronize ADC operation, along with a Start Of Conversion signal (`soc`), User Power Down (`usr_pwd`), and Temperature Sensor Enable (`tsen`). It uses a 5-bit channel selector (`chsel`) to choose one of the possible analog input channels. The module outputs a clock synchronized to the ADC core (`clkout_adccore`), an End Of Conversion signal (`eoc`), and a 12-bit Digital Output (`dout`) representing the converted analog value. Internally, it uses a signal `chsel_to_hw` as an intermediary between the channel selector and the ADC block to translate the channel selection from software to hardware-relevant representation. The module is divided into various sections: parameter declaration for configuration and simulation, I/O port definition, internal signal wiring, channel selection decoding with `chsel_code_converter_sw_to_hw`, and instantiation and parameterization of the core ADC functionality in `fiftyfivenm_adcblock_primitive_wrapper`. Configuration parameters include clock division, reference voltage levels, simulation controls, and device-specific settings, allowing for flexibility and adaptability to different system requirements and simulation scenarios.
