Module name: fiftyfivenm_adcblock_primitive_wrapper. Module specification: The fiftyfivenm_adcblock_primitive_wrapper serves as a Verilog module designed to interface with an ADC block tailored for a 55nm technology node, encapsulating functionalities like channel selection, start/end of conversion, and power management in an analog-to-digital conversion process. This wrapper module manages input ports including `clkin_from_pll_c0` (the clock input from a PLL), `soc` (start of conversion signal), `usr_pwd` (user power down control), `tsen` (temperature sensor enable), and `chsel` (5-bit channel select). The outputs facilitated by this module are `clkout_adccore` (clock output for the ADC core), `eoc` (end of conversion signal), and `dout` (12-bit digital output representing the ADC's analog input). Internally, a significant signal named `wire_from_adc_dout` is employed to connect the digital output from the core ADC block to the `dout` port of the module. The module code features multiple parameter declarations for configuration purposes, instantiation of the ADC block which can be either in standard or emulation mode controlled by the `DEBUG_AND_DEVELOPMENT` compilation switch, and definitions of parameters related to ADC module operation customization like clock division, reference voltage selection, and additional simulation parameters. This structured approach in the design enables clear configuration and flexible integration within broader digital systems operating in relevant technological nodes.
