Module-level comment: The chsel_code_converter_sw_to_hw module converts a 5-bit software channel code (`chsel_from_sw`) to a hardware-specific format (`chsel_to_hw`) for ADCs. It uses conditional logic based on device type and ADC configuration to select the appropriate channel mapping from predefined local parameters, ensuring accurate channel selection signal for varied ADC models. The conversion process is managed within an `always` block, which assigns the computed hardware code to a register that stabilizes the output signal.
