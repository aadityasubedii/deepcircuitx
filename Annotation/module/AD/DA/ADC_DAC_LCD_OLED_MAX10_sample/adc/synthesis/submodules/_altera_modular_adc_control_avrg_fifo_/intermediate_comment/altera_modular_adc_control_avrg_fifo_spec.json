    "spec": "Module name: altera_modular_adc_control_avrg_fifo.\n\nModule specification: The `altera_modular_adc_control_avrg_fifo` is a Verilog module designed to serve as a FIFO buffer interface for an ADC on Altera (Intel) FPGA platforms, specifically tailored for the MAX 10 device family. It orchestrates the orderly storage and retrieval of 12-bit ADC data based on synchronized clock signals, handling write and read requests, and it performs buffer empty/full status monitoring. The module's input ports include `clock` (the synchronization signal for data management), `data` (the 12-bit input from the ADC), `rdreq` (the read request, allowing data output when high), `sclr` (synchronous clear to empty the FIFO on a high signal), and `wrreq` (the write request, enabling data storage when high). The output ports are `empty` (signaling an empty buffer), `full` (indicating the buffer is at capacity), and `q` (providing the 12-bit data on a read request). Internally, the module utilizes `sub_wire0`, `sub_wire1`, and `sub_wire2` signals, which act as conduits for the status signals `empty`, `full`, and the data output `q`, respectively, coming from the `scfifo_component` submodule. The code is composed of a primary module definition that establishes the input/output ports, internal signal mappings to the output ports, and an instantiation of the `scfifo_component` submodule, which is configured via 'defparam' parameters to define FIFO characteristics such as memory type, size, width, and overflow/underflow behavior specific to the MAX 10 FPGA family. These configurations ensure the FIFO operates correctly, handling data inputs and outputs with the necessary checks for buffer limitations.",
