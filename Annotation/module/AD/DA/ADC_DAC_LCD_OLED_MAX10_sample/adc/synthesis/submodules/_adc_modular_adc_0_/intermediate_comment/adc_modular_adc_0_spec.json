    "spec": "Module name: adc_modular_adc_0. Module specification: The adc_modular_adc_0 module functions as an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) controller utilizing the Altera Modular ADC component to manage ADC operations effectively within a digital system. This module is architected to take several input signals including the main clock (clock_clk), an active-low reset signal (reset_sink_reset_n), an ADC clock derived from an external PLL (adc_pll_clock_clk), a PLL lock indicator (adc_pll_locked_export), and various command signals such as command_valid, command_channel, command_startofpacket, and command_endofpacket. These command signals manage ADC settings like the selection of ADC channel and indicate the start and end of a packet. The outputs include command_ready, which signifies the readiness to accept new commands, as well as response_valid, response_channel, response_data, response_startofpacket, and response_endofpacket, which pertain to the ADC conversion data and packet handling. Internally, the module utilizes `sync_valid` and `sync_ready` signals within the `altera_modular_adc_control` instance for synchronization purposes, although `sync_ready` is statically set to not ready in the current implementation. The internally instantiated `altera_modular_adc_control` block manages the core ADC control logic, processing commands, and generating responses under defined configurations specific to the system's hardware requirements. This clear bifurcation and management ensure precise and controlled acquisition and handling of data from analog inputs, converting them to digital format for further digital processing.",

It interfaces with external signals through input and output ports to manage ADC operations. Specifically, it configures the ADC settings such as clock division, analog input pin mask, and reference voltage. It processes commands (start, end of packet, and channel selection) and generates responses containing the ADC conversion data, along with indicators for the start and end of packet. The module operates under a given clock and reset conditions, and it also includes mechanisms to synchronize with an external PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) for clock management. This functionality is crucial in systems where analog signals need to be converted to digital format for further processing, ensuring precise and controlled acquisition of analog inputs."

                    "text": "Module name: adc_modular_adc_0. Module specification: The adc_modular_adc_0 module functions as an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) controller utilizing the Altera Modular ADC component to manage ADC operations effectively within a digital system. This module is architected to take several input signals including the main clock (clock_clk), an active-low reset signal (reset_sink_reset_n), an ADC clock derived from an external PLL (adc_pll_clock_clk), a PLL lock indicator (adc_pll_locked_export), and various command signals such as command_valid, command_channel, command_startofpacket, and command_endofpacket. These command signals manage ADC settings like the selection of ADC channel and indicate the start and end of a packet. The outputs include command_ready, which signifies the readiness to accept new commands, as well as response_valid, response_channel, response_data, response_startofpacket, and response_endofpacket, which pertain to the ADC conversion data and packet handling. Internally, the module utilizes `sync_valid` and `sync_ready` signals within the `altera_modular_adc_control` instance for synchronization purposes, although `sync_ready` is statically set to not ready in the current implementation. The internally instantiated `altera_modular_adc_control` block manages the core ADC control logic, processing commands, and generating responses under defined configurations specific to the system's hardware requirements. This clear bifurcation and management ensure precise and controlled acquisition and handling of data from analog inputs, converting them to digital format for further digital processing."
