    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_modular_adc_control_avrg_fifo` module implements a FIFO buffer for interfacing with an ADC. It synchronizes 12-bit data transfer using input signals (clock, read/write requests, clear) and indicates status through `empty`/`full` outputs. Internally, it relies on an `scfifo_component` configured for the MAX 10 FPGA, managing buffer capacity and data flow integrity with dedicated signal wires and parameter settings."
