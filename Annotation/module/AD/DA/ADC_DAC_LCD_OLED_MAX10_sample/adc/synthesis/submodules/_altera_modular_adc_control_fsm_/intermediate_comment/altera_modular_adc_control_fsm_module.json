    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a finite state machine (FSM) controller for an Altera modular ADC. It manages ADC operations including power-down, power-up, channel selection, conversion, and result handling. The FSM coordinates sampling, handles commands, generates control signals, and provides responses. It supports features like temperature sensing averaging and dual ADC mode synchronization. The module uses a state machine to control ADC behavior, manages timing with internal counters, and ensures proper sequencing of operations through various states and control signals."
