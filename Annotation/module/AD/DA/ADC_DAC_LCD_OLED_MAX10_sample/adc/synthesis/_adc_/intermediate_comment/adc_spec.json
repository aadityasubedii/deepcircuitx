    "spec": "Module name: adc. Module specification: The `adc` module is a Verilog-based hardware interface designed to facilitate communication between system-level hardware (like an FPGA) and an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). This module encapsulates the instantiation of `adc_modular_adc_0`, effectively acting as a structural conduit by mapping its input and output ports directly to the instanced module, with no internal signal manipulation. The inputs include `adc_pll_clock_clk` for the ADC's PLL circuitry clock, `adc_pll_locked_export` indicating the PLL lock status, `clock_clk` as the main system clock, `command_valid`, `command_channel`, `command_startofpacket`, `command_endofpacket` for managing ADC command signals, and `reset_sink_reset_n` which is an active-low reset signal. The outputs are `command_ready`, `response_valid`, indicating the validity of output data, `response_channel` showing the data source channel, `response_data` holding the converted digital signals, and `response_startofpacket` and `response_endofpacket` denoting the packet framing in the ADC response. The module contains no internal signals but uses the connections directly from the inputs to the outputs through the instantiated `adc_modular_adc_0`, providing a high-level interface that simplifies integration of the ADC into broader system architectures.",
