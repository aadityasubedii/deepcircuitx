    "module": "Module-level comment: The `i2cWR` module interfaces with I2C devices, managing write operations from start to stop conditions. It utilizes clocks (`clk`, `sclk`, `shiftClk`) for timing, maintains an operation state (`action`), processes data bytes (`TxData`), and sustains bit and byte counts. Logic blocks control start/stop conditions, data shifting, error checking, and the action state. Parameters `FCLK` and `SPEED` dictate I2C timing, ensuring compliant communication."
