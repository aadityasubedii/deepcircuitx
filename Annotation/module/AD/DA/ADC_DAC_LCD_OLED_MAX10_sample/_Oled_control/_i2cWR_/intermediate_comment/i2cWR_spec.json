    "spec": "Module name: i2cWR. \nModule specification: The `i2cWR` module is crafted for interfacing with I2C devices, specifically handling write operations. It takes care of generating the necessary I2C protocol signals including start condition, byte transmission, acknowledgment handling, and stop condition. The module accepts a clock signal (`clk`) for synchronization, a reset signal (`rst`) for initializing internal states, a device identifier (`iDevID`) for specifying the target I2C device, a start signal (`iStart`) to trigger the operation, a byte quantity (`iByteQnty`) indicating how many bytes to transmit, and the data byte to be sent (`iByteIn`). The output ports include a byte count indicator (`oByteCnt`) to track the progress of the transaction, an acknowledgment error signal (`oAckErr`) to indicate any NACK received, and an action signal (`oAction`) to show if a transaction is active.\n\nInternally, the module employs signals like `iSda` and `oSda` for reading from and driving the serial data line respectively, `iScl` and `oScl` for the serial clock line, `startBit`, and `stopBit` for generating start and stop conditions, a series of counters (`qtCnt`, `bitCnt`, `byteCnt`) for managing clock divisions and tracking current bits and bytes in transmission, and flags (`ackErr`, `action`) to indicate communication errors and the active state of a transmission. Clock division is managed through shift registers (`sclkReg`, `shiftClkReg`) to generate internal clocks (`sclk`, `shiftClk`) controlling the timing of I2C operations based on the module's parameters `FCLK` and `SPEED`.\n\nThe module's operation is organized into blocks handling specific tasks: Reset and clock management for the internal state and clock signals, start and stop condition generation, acknowledgment error detection, action state management to start or stop the write operation, and data transmission logic which includes data shifting and byte count management. Each block is critical for ensuring the correct sequence of operations as per the I2C protocol, making the `i2cWR` module an effective tool for I2C write operations in integrated circuits.",

This module generates the necessary signals to transmit bytes over I2C protocol, which includes start condition, byte transmission, acknowledgment handling, and stop condition. The user can specify the device ID (`iDevID`), initiate transactions (`iStart`), and indicate the number of bytes to write (`iByteQnty`). It receives the bytes to write (`iByteIn`) and generates the serial clock (`ioScl`) and data (`ioSda`) lines for I2C, also indicating the progress of the write operation through the byte count (`oByteCnt`). The module also provides an acknowledgment error signal (`oAckErr`) to show if any NACK (not acknowledged) received from the slave and an action signal (`oAction`) which indicates if an I2C action (write operation here) is in progress. The module operates in synchronization with a given clock (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst`). It uses parameters like `FCLK` for the frequency of the `clk` and `SPEED` for the I2C bus speed. The module's behavior is determined based on the I2C protocol timing requirements which are enforced by internal counters, state-registers, and clock division logic."

                    "text": "Module name: i2cWR. \nModule specification: The `i2cWR` module is crafted for interfacing with I2C devices, specifically handling write operations. It takes care of generating the necessary I2C protocol signals including start condition, byte transmission, acknowledgment handling, and stop condition. The module accepts a clock signal (`clk`) for synchronization, a reset signal (`rst`) for initializing internal states, a device identifier (`iDevID`) for specifying the target I2C device, a start signal (`iStart`) to trigger the operation, a byte quantity (`iByteQnty`) indicating how many bytes to transmit, and the data byte to be sent (`iByteIn`). The output ports include a byte count indicator (`oByteCnt`) to track the progress of the transaction, an acknowledgment error signal (`oAckErr`) to indicate any NACK received, and an action signal (`oAction`) to show if a transaction is active.\n\nInternally, the module employs signals like `iSda` and `oSda` for reading from and driving the serial data line respectively, `iScl` and `oScl` for the serial clock line, `startBit`, and `stopBit` for generating start and stop conditions, a series of counters (`qtCnt`, `bitCnt`, `byteCnt`) for managing clock divisions and tracking current bits and bytes in transmission, and flags (`ackErr`, `action`) to indicate communication errors and the active state of a transmission. Clock division is managed through shift registers (`sclkReg`, `shiftClkReg`) to generate internal clocks (`sclk`, `shiftClk`) controlling the timing of I2C operations based on the module's parameters `FCLK` and `SPEED`.\n\nThe module's operation is organized into blocks handling specific tasks: Reset and clock management for the internal state and clock signals, start and stop condition generation, acknowledgment error detection, action state management to start or stop the write operation, and data transmission logic which includes data shifting and byte count management. Each block is critical for ensuring the correct sequence of operations as per the I2C protocol, making the `i2cWR` module an effective tool for I2C write operations in integrated circuits."
