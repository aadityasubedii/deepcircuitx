Module name: i2cWR. 
Module specification: The `i2cWR` module is crafted for interfacing with I2C devices, specifically handling write operations. It takes care of generating the necessary I2C protocol signals including start condition, byte transmission, acknowledgment handling, and stop condition. The module accepts a clock signal (`clk`) for synchronization, a reset signal (`rst`) for initializing internal states, a device identifier (`iDevID`) for specifying the target I2C device, a start signal (`iStart`) to trigger the operation, a byte quantity (`iByteQnty`) indicating how many bytes to transmit, and the data byte to be sent (`iByteIn`). The output ports include a byte count indicator (`oByteCnt`) to track the progress of the transaction, an acknowledgment error signal (`oAckErr`) to indicate any NACK received, and an action signal (`oAction`) to show if a transaction is active.

Internally, the module employs signals like `iSda` and `oSda` for reading from and driving the serial data line respectively, `iScl` and `oScl` for the serial clock line, `startBit`, and `stopBit` for generating start and stop conditions, a series of counters (`qtCnt`, `bitCnt`, `byteCnt`) for managing clock divisions and tracking current bits and bytes in transmission, and flags (`ackErr`, `action`) to indicate communication errors and the active state of a transmission. Clock division is managed through shift registers (`sclkReg`, `shiftClkReg`) to generate internal clocks (`sclk`, `shiftClk`) controlling the timing of I2C operations based on the module's parameters `FCLK` and `SPEED`.

The module's operation is organized into blocks handling specific tasks: Reset and clock management for the internal state and clock signals, start and stop condition generation, acknowledgment error detection, action state management to start or stop the write operation, and data transmission logic which includes data shifting and byte count management. Each block is critical for ensuring the correct sequence of operations as per the I2C protocol, making the `i2cWR` module an effective tool for I2C write operations in integrated circuits.
