    "module": "Module-level comment: The ExtFont module interfaces with ROM for extended fonts in OLED displays, using an 11-bit `address` to read 8-bit data (`q`) at `clock` edges. It employs an `altsyncram` component as ROM, initialized with \"ExtFont.mif\" for font data, specifically designed for Altera MAX 10 FPGAs. Internal signal `sub_wire0` facilitates data output. Configured to disable writing, it simplifies control signals for efficient read operations."
