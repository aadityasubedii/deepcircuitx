    "spec": "Module name: ExtFont. Module specification: The ExtFont module is designed to interface with read-only memory (ROM), specifically for extended fonts utilized in OLED displays or similar applications, employing an Altera FPGA memory block (`altsyncram`) configured as ROM. It accepts a 11-bit input `address` and a `clock` signal; the `address` specifies the ROM location to read, and the clock signal orchestrates the timing of data retrieval. The module outputs an 8-bit data value (`q`) corresponding to the provided address, effectively serving font data to the system. Internal signal `sub_wire0` acts as an intermediary, carrying data from the `altsyncram_component`'s output (`q_a`) to the module's `q` output port. The code structure commences with the module and port declarations, followed by internal signal definitions. The core functionality is encapsulated within the `altsyncram` block, parameterized to operate in ROM mode and initialized with the \"ExtFont.mif\" file, indicating preloaded font data. This section is rich in configuration parameters that fine-tune the ROM's operation according to the module's requirements, such as disabling write operations and specifying the ROM's size and data width. The module is tailored for Altera's MAX 10 FPGA family, with settings to bypass additional clock and control signal manipulations for speed and simplicity. The clear separation of component instantiation, port assignments, and parameter configurations highlights structured hardware design practices, optimizing readability and maintainability.",

It uses an `altsyncram` component, which is a dedicated Altera (now part of Intel) FPGA memory block configured as ROM in this instance. The module has an 11-bit input address bus, from which it can select one of 2048 possible memory locations to read an 8-bit data value. The `altsyncram_component` is parameterized to operate in ROM mode with the memory initialization file \"ExtFont.mif\", suggesting it's preloaded with font data for use by the containing system. The output `q` is directly connected to the `sub_wire0`, which is driven by the `q_a` output of the `altsyncram_component`, where the actual data retrieval happens upon the rising edge of the `clock` signal. The module does not allow data writing as the write enable (`wren_a` and `wren_b`) is tied to a low logic level (0). The clock and other control signals are set to bypass or constant logic levels, reflecting a simplified interface optimized for read operations with minimal latency or additional control features."
