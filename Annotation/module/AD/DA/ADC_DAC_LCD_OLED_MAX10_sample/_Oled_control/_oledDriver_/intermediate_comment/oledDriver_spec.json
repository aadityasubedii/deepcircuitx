    "spec": "Module name: oledDriver. \nModule specification: The 'oledDriver' module is designed to control an OLED display via I2C communication for displaying characters and graphics. It manages initialization, character display, and graphical data presentation through a systematic progression dictated by a finite state machine (FSM). The module's input ports include 'clk' (clock signal), 'rst' (reset signal), 'iMode' (mode selector), 'iPlaceHolder' (placeholder selector), 'iChar' (character selector), and 'iDraw' (initiate drawing signal). The output ports are 'oBusy' (indicates operational engagement) and 'oAckErr' (indicates errors in I2C communication acknowledgment). Bidirectional ports 'ioScl' and 'ioSda' are used for the I2C serial clock and data lines, respectively. Internal signals such as 'state', 'next_state', 'cnt' (counter), 'busy', 'dataSelect', and 'page' orchestrate behaviors like timing, state transitions, data handling, and page navigation in OLED operations. The design integrates several sub-modules: 'i2cWR' for managing I2C writing operations, 'OledInit' for basic initialization sequences, 'OledLogo' for logo display management, and two font handling instances 'MainFont' and 'ExtFont'. The FSM within 'always' blocks handle various state transitions for initialization, idle handling, making new character or graphic displays, and refreshing as triggered by input signals, thereby enabling dynamic display updates on the OLED screen.",

                    "text": "Module name: oledDriver. \nModule specification: The 'oledDriver' module is designed to control an OLED display via I2C communication for displaying characters and graphics. It manages initialization, character display, and graphical data presentation through a systematic progression dictated by a finite state machine (FSM). The module's input ports include 'clk' (clock signal), 'rst' (reset signal), 'iMode' (mode selector), 'iPlaceHolder' (placeholder selector), 'iChar' (character selector), and 'iDraw' (initiate drawing signal). The output ports are 'oBusy' (indicates operational engagement) and 'oAckErr' (indicates errors in I2C communication acknowledgment). Bidirectional ports 'ioScl' and 'ioSda' are used for the I2C serial clock and data lines, respectively. Internal signals such as 'state', 'next_state', 'cnt' (counter), 'busy', 'dataSelect', and 'page' orchestrate behaviors like timing, state transitions, data handling, and page navigation in OLED operations. The design integrates several sub-modules: 'i2cWR' for managing I2C writing operations, 'OledInit' for basic initialization sequences, 'OledLogo' for logo display management, and two font handling instances 'MainFont' and 'ExtFont'. The FSM within 'always' blocks handle various state transitions for initialization, idle handling, making new character or graphic displays, and refreshing as triggered by input signals, thereby enabling dynamic display updates on the OLED screen."
