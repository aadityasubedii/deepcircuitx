It utilizes a synchronous RAM component (`altsyncram`) configured as Read-Only Memory (ROM) to store predefined data patterns, likely for an OLED display. The module accepts an address input which selects which part of the data to read, and the output `q` provides the corresponding 8-bit data from the ROM. The RAM component is configured via parameters to match specific interface requirements and hardware specifications, such as intended device family \"MAX 10\" and operation mode set to \"ROM\". The `clock` input is used to synchronize the data read operations, ensuring stable and correct data outputs for the display operation."

This input is used to fetch the appropriate 8-bit data corresponding to the graphics or patterns stored in the ROM, which is then displayed on an OLED.\n- `clock`: A synchronization signal used for timing the data reads from the memory. The clock ensures that the data outputs are updated consistently in sync with the system clock, facilitating stable operations in digital circuits.\n\nOutput ports: [q].

The `address` input specifies which data to read, and the read data is temporarily held in `sub_wire0`.
