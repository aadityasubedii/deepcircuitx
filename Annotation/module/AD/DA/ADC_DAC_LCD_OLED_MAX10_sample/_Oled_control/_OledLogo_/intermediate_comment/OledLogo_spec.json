    "spec": "Module name: OledLogo. Module specification: The OledLogo module interfaces with an OLED display to show images or patterns stored in Read-Only Memory (ROM), designed particularly for usage with a synchronous RAM component (`altsyncram`). The module has two input ports: `address`, a 9-bit input determining the ROM's memory address for data retrieval, and `clock`, which is used to synchronize data read operations. The single output port, `q`, is an 8-bit output that presents data fetched from the ROM, corresponding to pixel data for OLED display. Internally, the module uses a signal `sub_wire0` which is an 8-bit wire acting as an intermediary to hold the data from `altsyncram` before transferring it to output `q`. The code primarily consists of the declaration of inputs and outputs, the instantiation of the `altsyncram` component which is configured to act as ROM through parameter settings (`operation_mode` set to \"ROM\"), defining the specific device family and memory configurations (e.g., memory words, address width), and connecting internal wires and inputs/outputs to this component appropriately. This structure ensures the module\u2019s capability to fetch and display predefined graphical data consistently with the system\u2019s operations.",

It utilizes a synchronous RAM component (`altsyncram`) configured as Read-Only Memory (ROM) to store predefined data patterns, likely for an OLED display. The module accepts an address input which selects which part of the data to read, and the output `q` provides the corresponding 8-bit data from the ROM. The RAM component is configured via parameters to match specific interface requirements and hardware specifications, such as intended device family \"MAX 10\" and operation mode set to \"ROM\".
