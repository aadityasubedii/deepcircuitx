Module-level comment: The OledLogo module interfaces with an OLED display, rendering pixel data from ROM. It uses a 9-bit address input to read 8-bit data at the synchronized clock pulse from an `altsyncram` component, which is pre-configured as ROM with the initialization file. Data output is available on the `q` port for display operations.
