Module name: OledLogo. Module specification: The OledLogo module interfaces with an OLED display to show images or patterns stored in Read-Only Memory (ROM), designed particularly for usage with a synchronous RAM component (`altsyncram`). The module has two input ports: `address`, a 9-bit input determining the ROM's memory address for data retrieval, and `clock`, which is used to synchronize data read operations. The single output port, `q`, is an 8-bit output that presents data fetched from the ROM, corresponding to pixel data for OLED display. Internally, the module uses a signal `sub_wire0` which is an 8-bit wire acting as an intermediary to hold the data from `altsyncram` before transferring it to output `q`. The code primarily consists of the declaration of inputs and outputs, the instantiation of the `altsyncram` component which is configured to act as ROM through parameter settings (`operation_mode` set to "ROM"), defining the specific device family and memory configurations (e.g., memory words, address width), and connecting internal wires and inputs/outputs to this component appropriately. This structure ensures the module’s capability to fetch and display predefined graphical data consistently with the system’s operations.
