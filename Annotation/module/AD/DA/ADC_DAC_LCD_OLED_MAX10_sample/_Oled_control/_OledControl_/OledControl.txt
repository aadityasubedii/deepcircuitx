Module-level comment: The OledControl module manages an OLED screen, interfacing via I2C protocol. Functionality includes data display in selectable modes and dynamic busy/idle state handling. Implementation utilizes an FSM to orchestrate state transitions, an I2C driver instance (`oledDriver`), and internal counters/registers for timing and data processing. Inputs dictate mode and data selection, outputs signal operation status, and bidirectional ports handle I2C communication.
