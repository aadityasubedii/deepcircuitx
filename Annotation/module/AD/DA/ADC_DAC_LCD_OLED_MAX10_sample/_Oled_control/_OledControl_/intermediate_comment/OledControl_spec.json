    "spec": "Module name: OledControl. \nModule specification: The OledControl module is responsible for managing the operation and display functionalities of an OLED screen using I2C communication. It operates based on input signals that include a system clock (`clk`), a reset signal (`rst`), a mode selection (`iMode`), binary-coded decimal data (`iBcdData`), and a selection signal (`iSelect`). The outputs of the module are an acknowledgment/error signal (`oAckErr`) and a display busy status (`oDispBusy`), with two additional bidirectional ports `ioScl` and `ioSda` for I2C communication. Internally, `OledControl` uses several crucial signals: `state` and `next_state` for controlling the finite state machine's (FSM) behavior, `cnt` for timing operations, `dispBusy` reflecting the busy status of the OLED, `placeHolder` and `symbol` for handling data to be displayed, `drawSymbol` to manage drawing operations, `marker` to track data selection, and `displayData` holding the processed BCD data ready for display. The code is structured in blocks for state transitions (`always @(posedge rst or posedge clk)`), synchronous operations based on the clock (`always @(*)` for state management and `always @(negedge clk)` for operations within states), I2C display driving (`oledDriver` instance with parameters like clock frequency and I2C speed), and assignments (`assign` statements) that tackle display data processing and busy status updates. This structured approach allows for clear and efficient management of display data and interaction with the OLED screen under various operation modes determined by the input signals.",

The module controls the sequential display of processed data symbols on the OLED based on system clock and reset inputs, adjusting display characteristics like symbols shown per mode. Additionally, it manages transitions between displaying data and idling states using an encapsulated display driver, tracking display busyness and acknowledging errors through appropriate signals.

                    "text": "Module name: OledControl. \nModule specification: The OledControl module is responsible for managing the operation and display functionalities of an OLED screen using I2C communication. It operates based on input signals that include a system clock (`clk`), a reset signal (`rst`), a mode selection (`iMode`), binary-coded decimal data (`iBcdData`), and a selection signal (`iSelect`). The outputs of the module are an acknowledgment/error signal (`oAckErr`) and a display busy status (`oDispBusy`), with two additional bidirectional ports `ioScl` and `ioSda` for I2C communication. Internally, `OledControl` uses several crucial signals: `state` and `next_state` for controlling the finite state machine's (FSM) behavior, `cnt` for timing operations, `dispBusy` reflecting the busy status of the OLED, `placeHolder` and `symbol` for handling data to be displayed, `drawSymbol` to manage drawing operations, `marker` to track data selection, and `displayData` holding the processed BCD data ready for display. The code is structured in blocks for state transitions (`always @(posedge rst or posedge clk)`), synchronous operations based on the clock (`always @(*)` for state management and `always @(negedge clk)` for operations within states), I2C display driving (`oledDriver` instance with parameters like clock frequency and I2C speed), and assignments (`assign` statements) that tackle display data processing and busy status updates. This structured approach allows for clear and efficient management of display data and interaction with the OLED screen under various operation modes determined by the input signals."
