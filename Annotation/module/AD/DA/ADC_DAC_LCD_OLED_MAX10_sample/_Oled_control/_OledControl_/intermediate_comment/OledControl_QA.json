It handles the display of data by processing input signals that determine the mode of data display and data selection. The module controls the sequential display of processed data symbols on the OLED based on system clock and reset inputs, adjusting display characteristics like symbols shown per mode. Additionally, it manages transitions between displaying data and idling states using an encapsulated display driver, tracking display busyness and acknowledging errors through appropriate signals. This module plays a crucial role in an embedded system by interfacing and controlling an OLED display unit efficiently."
