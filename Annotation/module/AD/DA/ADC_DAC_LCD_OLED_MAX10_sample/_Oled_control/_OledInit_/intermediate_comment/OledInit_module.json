    "module": "Module-level comment: The OledInit module initializes an OLED display using predefined configuration data stored in a ROM, accessed via Altera's altsyncram component. It uses a 6-bit address input to select specific 8-bit initialization commands, synchronized by an external clock signal. The internal signal sub_wire0 temporarily holds the ROM output before passing it to the module's q output, ensuring updated data on each clock cycle. Configurations for the ROM, like file path and operational settings, are set to optimize for a MAX 10 FPGA, ensuring stable and efficient initialization of the OLED."
