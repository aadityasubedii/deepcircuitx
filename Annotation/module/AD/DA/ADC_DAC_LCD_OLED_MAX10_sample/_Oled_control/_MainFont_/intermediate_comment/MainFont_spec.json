    "spec": "Module name: MainFont.\nModule specification: The `MainFont` module is designed to function as a font storage ROM used primarily for mapping character data for display on an OLED screen. It takes an 11-bit `address` as input to select the specific byte of font data from the ROM, and a `clock` input to synchronize the memory read operation. The single output port `q` is an 8-bit line which outputs the retrieved byte of font data corresponding to the input address. Internally, the module relies on a signal named `sub_wire0`, an 8-bit wire which connects the ROM's output to the `q` port, enabling the transfer of data byte from the memory to the output.\n\nThe code is structured into several blocks, starting with the module declaration and port definitions, where the `address`, `clock`, and `q` ports are declared. Next, it uses the `altsyncram` component from Altera to model the synchronous ROM, with connections to the aforementioned ports. Numerous parameters are set using `defparam` to configure the ROM behavior, such as specifying the initialization file (`.mif`) that contains the font data, setting the memory size and data width, as well as configuring it to operate in ROM mode with specific device family indications. The `altsyncram` component is parameterized with properties like the absence of asynchronous address clear, and bypassing clock enable signals, highlighting the customization of the read-only memory module.",

It uses a single input address line to look up an 8-bit value from the ROM, which probably represents a byte from the font data set.\n\nThe module has the following ports:\n- `address`: An 11-bit input that is likely to be used as the ROM address to read a specific byte from the font data.\n- `clock`: An input that is presumably used to synchronize the read operation of the ROM.\n- `q`: An 8-bit output that presents the data byte read from the ROM at the address specified by the `address` input.\n\nInternally, the module instantiates `altsyncram`, which is a parameterized Altera (Intel FPGA) synchronous RAM module, though it is configured in ROM mode as indicated by the `operation_mode` parameter. The behavior and functionality are further customized by a series of `defparam` assignments that set the RAM block's basic properties and behavior, such as disabling address clear (`address_aclr_a`), bypassing clock enables (`clock_enable_input_a` and `clock_enable_output_a`), specifying the initialization file (`init_file`) that contains the font data, and setting the width and depth of the stored data.\n\nIn summary, this module does not perform any writing, as seen by the `wren_a` and `wren_b` signals being tied to `1'b0`, indicating read-only behavior consistent with a ROM. The font data is loaded from a Memory Initialization File (MIF) which specifies the bit patterns for each character or symbol to be displayed."
