    "module": "Module-level comment: The `MainFont` module acts as a ROM for storing font data used in OLED displays. It maps a given 11-bit address input to an 8-bit output using the `altsyncram` Altera synchronous RAM in ROM mode. With ROM-specific configuration set through `defparam`, it loads character data from a `.mif` file without supporting any write operations, optimized for the MAX 10 FPGA family."
