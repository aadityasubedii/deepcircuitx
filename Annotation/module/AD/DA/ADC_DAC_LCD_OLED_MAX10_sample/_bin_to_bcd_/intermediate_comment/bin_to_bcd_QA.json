The input 'iBIN' is a 20-bit binary number, and the output 'oBCD' is a 24-bit number split into six 4-bit groups representing each digit in BCD format, ranging from hundreds of thousands (HofThous) to ones. This conversion uses a double dabble algorithm that iteratively shifts and adjusts values to convert the binary input into a decimally-correct BCD output."

Explanation: The output port `oBCD` is a 24-bit wide binary output that provides the BCD representation of the input binary number. It is divided into six 4-bit groups, where each group corresponds to a BCD digit: hundreds of thousands (HofThous), tens of thousands (TofThous), thousands (Thousands), hundreds (Hundreds), tens (Tens), and ones (Ones).
