    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"bin_to_bcd\" module converts a 20-bit binary number (iBIN) to a 24-bit BCD representation (oBCD). It uses internal 4-bit registers (HofThous, TofThous, Thousands, Hundreds, Tens, Ones) to perform the double dabble algorithm. Through iterative shifting and conditional additions, the binary input is processed to populate each BCD digit correctly, which are then combined to form the final BCD output."
