Module name: dac_top. Module specification: The 'dac_top' module is designed to manage a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) system, integrating input controls, clock management, and display systems into a comprehensive unit. It handles input from four buttons (iBtn[3:0]) that control various functionalities like reset, scaling, and mode selection, which are reflected visually through an 8-bit LED output (oLed[7:0]). The primary input clock (iClk) feeds into a PLL to produce derived clocks (clk, clk_10k, clk_50M) for different operational requirements. It supports DAC and ADC operations with additional comprehensive communication through I2C. Outputs also include controller signals for the DAC such as reset (oDacReset), latch (oDacLatch), synchronization (oDacSync), and serial communication lines (oDacScl, oDacSda). Functional blocks within the code handle ADC data acquisition and processing, including scaling and filtering, with results being output to a display via comprehensive BCD conversion. This module uses an internal delay mechanism to debounce button inputs and manage DAC operations based on button conditions, including a hold function to maintain button states and some one-shot signals for edge detection. The use of different blocks like PLLs for clock generation and various drivers for the ADC, DAC, and display modules confirms the moduleâ€™s functionality, ensuring precise digital-to-analog conversion, data display, and user interaction through a complex but efficient synthesis of hardware control algorithms and interfacing techniques.
