    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'dac_top' module manages a DAC system with integrated ADC operations and digital displays driven by user button inputs. It uses PLLs to generate multiple clock domains, debounces inputs, controls DAC through button interactions with visual feedback via LEDs and displays, handles ADC data processing with filtering, scaling, and converts processed data for display purposes. The module is organized around functional blocks for input handling, data conversion, display output, and signal synchronization, facilitating efficient and responsive device interaction and data visualization."
