It handles button debouncing, controls DAC operations based on button inputs, delivers processed ADC results onto a display, and updates an OLED display based on the system's operating mode. The module encompasses detailed functionalities ranging from signal filtering, data scaling, and binary to BCD conversion to enhance interoperability between the ADC/DAC and various displays. The overall operation is synchronized via multiple clock domains derived from PLL circuits."
