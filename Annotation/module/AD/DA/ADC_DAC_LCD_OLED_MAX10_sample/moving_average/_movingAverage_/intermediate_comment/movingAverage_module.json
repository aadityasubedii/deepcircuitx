    "module": "Module-level comment: The `movingAverage` module computes a moving average for a stream of 12-bit data inputs, adjustable by the `iFilterWidth`. It synchronizes to a `clk` signal and resets with `rst`. Data is stored and processed using an instantiated `filterCells` for memory operations. Control flows through a state machine managing sample reading, averaging computations, and output data readiness. The output is either the calculated average or direct input based on filter settings."
