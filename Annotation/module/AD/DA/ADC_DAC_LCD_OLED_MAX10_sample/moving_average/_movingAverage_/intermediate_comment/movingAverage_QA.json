It takes an input stream of 12-bit data (`iDataIn`) and calculates the moving average based on a specified filter width (`iFilterWidth`). When a new sample is ready (`iSampleReady`), it is stored in a filter block (possibly a memory or a shift register) which is abstracted by the instantiating of `filterCells`. The module processes the input data dynamically as it changes and computes the average when enough samples as indicated by `iFilterWidth` have been collected. The result is available at `oDataOut`, and a ready signal (`oDataReady`) indicates when the output data is valid. The computation is synchronized to a clock (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst`). The filter only enables when `iFilterWidth` is greater than 1, and the system is not in reset; otherwise, the output directly follows the input. State machine logic controls the reading of samples, storing them, calculating the average, and managing the output data readiness."
