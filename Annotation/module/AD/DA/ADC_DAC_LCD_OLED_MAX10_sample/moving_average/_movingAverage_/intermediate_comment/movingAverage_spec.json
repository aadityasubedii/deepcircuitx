    "spec": "Module name: movingAverage.\nModule specification: The `movingAverage` module is responsible for calculating the moving average of a stream of 12-bit data inputs (`iDataIn`). This calculation occurs over a specified filter width (`iFilterWidth`), which defines the number of samples included in the average calculation. The module processes data only when a new sample is indicated by the `iSampleReady` signal. The primary inputs to this module include a clock signal (`clk`), which synchronizes the operations, a reset signal (`rst`) for reinitializing internal states, the data input signal (`iDataIn`), a new sample indication signal (`iSampleReady`), and the filter width signal (`iFilterWidth`). The outputs are the 12-bit moving average value (`oDataOut`) and a signal (`oDataReady`) indicating the data validity. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `wrEn` for enabling data writes to the filter storage, `wrIndex` and `cellIndex` for handling memory indexing, `cellData` for holding retrieved data, `dataOut` for the computed average, and control flags like `dataReady` and `filterEnable`. The module operates by enabling the filter when `iFilterWidth` is greater than 1 and not in reset. The sequential logic in the module is managed by a finite state machine, which transitions through states for sampling, averaging, and output handling, based on the clock and sample availability. The `filterCells` block is instantiated for memory operations, managing reading and writing of sample data. This structure ensures the moving average computation adjusts dynamically with input data variations, providing a real-time processing capability in data-sensitive applications like signal processing and real-time analytics.",

It takes an input stream of 12-bit data (`iDataIn`) and calculates the moving average based on a specified filter width (`iFilterWidth`). When a new sample is ready (`iSampleReady`), it is stored in a filter block (possibly a memory or a shift register) which is abstracted by the instantiating of `filterCells`. The module processes the input data dynamically as it changes and computes the average when enough samples as indicated by `iFilterWidth` have been collected. The result is available at `oDataOut`, and a ready signal (`oDataReady`) indicates when the output data is valid. The computation is synchronized to a clock (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst`). The filter only enables when `iFilterWidth` is greater than 1, and the system is not in reset; otherwise, the output directly follows the input. State machine logic controls the reading of samples, storing them, calculating the average, and managing the output data readiness."
