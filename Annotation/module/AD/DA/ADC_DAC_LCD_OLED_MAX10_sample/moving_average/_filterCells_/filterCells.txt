Module-level comment: The 'filterCells' module serves as a dual-port memory interface for MAX 10 FPGAs, utilizing Altera's 'altsyncram' for data storage and retrieval. It synchronizes data read/write operations to the FPGA's clock, with dedicated inputs for data, read/write addresses, and write enable signal. Output data from the specified read address is managed through an internal wire 'sub_wire0', achieving efficient memory management and data access in hardware designs.
