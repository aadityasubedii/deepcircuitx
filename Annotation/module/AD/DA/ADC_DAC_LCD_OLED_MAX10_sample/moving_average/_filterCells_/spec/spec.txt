Module name: filterCells. Module specification: The 'filterCells' module is a dual-port RAM interface designed for MAX 10 FPGA devices, utilizing the 'altsyncram' component from Altera. The module facilitates the storage and retrieval of data by providing synchronized read and write operations with the FPGA's clock. It has five input ports: 'clock', a synchronization signal for read and write operations; 'data', a 12-bit input handling the data to be written into the RAM; 'rdaddress', an 11-bit input defining the retrieval data address; 'wraddress', an 11-bit input defining the write data address; and 'wren', a control signal that enables writing when high. The sole output port 'q' is a 12-bit bus that outputs data read from the specified 'rdaddress'. Internally, the module employs a signal 'sub_wire0', a 12-bit wire transferring data from the RAM to the output port 'q'. The main code integrates the 'altsyncram_component' configured for dual-port operation with specific attributes for address management, clock controls, and data widths tailored to support a seamless and efficient dual-port RAM operation without initialization at power-up. The module provides robust control over memory management within the FPGA, ensuring optimal performance for tasks requiring high-speed data access and integrity.
