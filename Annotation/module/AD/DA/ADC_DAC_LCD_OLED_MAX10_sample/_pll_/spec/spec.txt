Module name: pll. 
Module specification: The "pll" module implements a phase-locked loop using the Altera-specific "altpll" component for clock management within digital systems. It primarily accepts a single input clock signal 'inclk0' and generates three output clocks 'c0', 'c1', and 'c2' with potentially different configurations set by the parameters of the 'altpll' component. 'inclk0' serves as the reference clock signal from which the PLL synthesizes the output clocks. 'c0', 'c1', and 'c2' are designed to be used in different sections of a digital system, with 'c0' typically being a synchronous clock with the input signal, while 'c1' and 'c2' can be configured for different frequencies and phases. Internally, the module uses a set of wires named 'sub_wire0' through 'sub_wire6' to route clocks and handle signal concatenation necessary for the PLL's operations. 'sub_wire0' routes the input signal, 'sub_wire1' forms a 2-bit vector for the PLL input, 'sub_wire2' is a constant value to ensure a correct signal structure, 'sub_wire3' is the vector with five potential PLL output clocks, and 'sub_wire4' to 'sub_wire6' extract individual clocks for the module outputs. The code also includes a configuration block (defparam) that sets various PLL parameters like bandwidth type, clock division and multiplication factors, phase shifts, and intended device family, maximizing the precision and compatibility of the generated clocks. These aspects make the 'pll' module an integral part of the clock generation and synchronization process within FPGA-based systems designed with Altera tools.
