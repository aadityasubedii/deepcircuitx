Module name: one_shot. 

Module specification: The one_shot module is designed to generate a single clock pulse output on the 'dout' signal when a specified edge transition is detected on the 'din' input. This module operates synchronously with the clock signal 'clk'. The type of edge that triggers the output pulse is controlled by the parameter EDGE, with configurations for rising edge (EDGE = 0), falling edge (EDGE = 1), or either edge (EDGE = 2). The width of the pulse is determined by the PULSE_WIDTH parameter, which specifies the size of the internal shift register 'buff'. 'buff' is employed to monitor transitions by storing the history of 'din' across multiple clock cycles, with each clock cycle shifting in the current 'din' value at the most significant position and shifting out from the least significant position. The module comprises several code blocks: initialization of output 'dout' and 'buff', a sequential block for updating 'buff' on every positive edge of 'clk', a generate loop for propagating values through the 'buff' shift register, and a combinational logic block for setting 'dout' based on 'buff' contents and the EDGE configuration. This structured arrangement ensures that 'dout' outputs a pulse accurately upon the detection of the specified edge transitions.
