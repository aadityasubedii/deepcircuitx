The EDGE parameter determines the type of edge that triggers the pulse: a rising edge (EDGE = 0), a falling edge (EDGE = 1), or any edge (EDGE = 2). The PULSE_WIDTH parameter defines the width of the internal shift register (buff) that is utilized to detect transitions on the input signal and to hold the pulse for the specified duration. The module uses a shift register mechanism, where the input signal is shifted through the register with each clock cycle. Depending on the EDGE parameter, the output signal is the result of a logical operation between the input signal and the last bit of the buffer (buff[0]), with the purpose of generating a one-shot pulse output based on the input signal transitions and configurations."

On every positive edge of the clock, 'buff' shifts in the value of 'din' to its most significant bit and shifts all other bits to the next lower significant bit.
