    "spec": "Module name: ad5681_driver.\n\nModule specification: The ad5681_driver module is designed to manage the interface and data transmission between a controller and an AD5681 digital-to-analog converter (DAC) using an SPI-like protocol. The module features input ports including `clk` (clock input for operation synchronization), `rst` (reset input for initializing internal states and outputs), `iData` (a 24-bit input data meant for the DAC, encapsulating command and payload), and `iStart` (a start signal for initiating data transmission). The output ports consist of `oSync` (chip select, active low, signaling the start and end of data transmission), `oScl` (serial clock output controlling data sampling and shifting), `oSda` (serial data output transmitting the bit-stream to the DAC), and `oLdac` (output latch signal instructing the DAC when to update its output).\n\nInternally, the module utilizes several signals: `state` and `next_state` for managing the state machine controlling the module's operation; `shdata` for temporarily storing and shifting the input data; `bcnt` for keeping track of the number of bits shifted out; `sclk_en` and `sclk_en_i` for controlling the generation of the serial clock; `csel` for indicating DAC communication selection; and `ldac` for controlling the DAC output update timing. \n\nThe code is organized into blocks focused on data shifting and serialization (`shdata` manipulation), state management (state transitions based on input and internal conditions), output signal generation (`oScl`, `oSync`, `oLdac`, `oSda` assignments), and condition-based operations (like resetting internal variables and managing bit counting). These blocks collectively enable the module to serialize the 24-bit input data (`iData`) and control the timing and signals necessary for interfacing with the AD5681 DAC effectively. This includes not only data transmission but also synchronization tasks like generating clock signals and managing the latch and chip select operations for accurate DAC operation.",

It is essential for the timing of state transitions, data shifting, and signal generation.\n- rst: Reset input, when asserted (typically high), it initializes or resets the module's internal states, counters, and outputs to their default states.\n- iData: 24-bit serial data input meant to be sent to the DAC. The data contains the DAC command and data payload as per the AD5681 specification.\n- iStart: Start signal input, used to begin the data transmission process. When high, it triggers the module to start serialization and transmission of the data in `iData` to the DAC.\n\nOutput ports: oSync, oScl, oSda, oLdac.\nExplanation:\n- oSync: Chip select output, used to activate the DAC's SPI interface (active low). It helps in framing the communication - signaling when the data transmission starts and stops.\n- oScl: Serial clock output, derived from the main clock and controls the sampling and shifting of serial data into the DAC.\n- oSda: Serial data output, sends the bit-stream to the DAC. This is the serialized form of the 24-bit input data `iData`.\n- oLdac: Output latch signal for the DAC.

It's essential for determining the module's behavior at any given time, including when to start data transmission, control clock signals, and manage chip select and latch operations.\n- next_state: Represents the next state of the state machine. It's used in combinational logic to decide the next state based on the current state and inputs such as `iStart` and `bcnt`. This facilitates state transitions within the module.\n- shdata: Shift data register. It temporarily stores the 24-bit `iData` input and sequentially shifts it to serialize the data for transmission via `oSda`. Its primary role is to maintain and manipulate the data being sent to the DAC.\n- bcnt: Bit count register. It keeps track of the number of bits that have been shifted out during the data transmission process. It's crucial for ensuring that all 24 bits of the input data are correctly serialized and transmitted.\n- sclk_en: Serial clock enable signal. It controls the generation of the serial clock (`oScl`) for the DAC. When high, it allows the serial clock to be active, facilitating the serialization of data.\n- sclk_en_i: A delayed version of `sclk_en`. It's used in generating the `oScl` signal in a manner that aligns with the required clocking scheme for data transmission. Helps in controlling the edge of the serial clock signal.\n- csel: Chip select signal. It indicates whether the DAC is selected for communication (active low). Internally, it is used to generate the `oSync` output signal, managing the start and end of the data transmission session.\n- ldac: Latch signal controlling when the DAC updates its output. It's used to generate the `oLdac` output signal. When high, it instructs the DAC to update its output based on the newly received data, effectively synchronizing data updates with data reception."
