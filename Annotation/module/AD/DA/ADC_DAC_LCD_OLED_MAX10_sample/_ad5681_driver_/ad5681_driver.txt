Module-level comment: The `ad5681_driver` module interfaces with an AD5681 DAC using an SPI-like protocol, handling serialization and transmission of 24-bit data (`iData`). It synchronizes operations via a clock (`clk`) and uses a state machine with internal signals for data shifting (`shdata`), and control of serial clock (`sclk_en`), DAC selection (`csel`), and output updates (`ldac`). Outputs include `oSync`, `oScl`, `oSda`, and `oLdac` to manage the DAC communication effectively.
