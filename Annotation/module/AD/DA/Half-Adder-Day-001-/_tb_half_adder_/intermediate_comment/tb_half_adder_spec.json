    "spec": "Module name: tb_half_adder. \nModule specification: The 'tb_half_adder' is a Verilog testbench module designed to validate the operation of a half-adder digital circuit. Its primary function is to apply various input test vectors to a half-adder design, labeled as instance 'A1', to verify the correct generation of sum and carry outputs for each possible pair of single-bit inputs. It comprises two input ports: 'a' and 'b', which serve as single-bit binary inputs to the half-adder circuit representing the operands to be added. There are also two output ports: 'sum' and 'carry', which are single-bit outputs where 'sum' indicates the result of addition without carry, and 'carry' indicates the carry-out from the addition. Within the module, 'sum' and 'carry' are declared as internal wires, establishing connections between the half-adder instance outputs and the testbench environment to facilitate result observation. The code structure is separated into three main sections: the declaration of inputs as registers ('reg a,b;'), the declaration of outputs as wires ('wire sum, carry;'), and the instantiation of the half-adder module ('half_adder A1(.a(a),.b(b),.sum(sum),.carry(carry));'). The behavioral part of the testbench is the 'initial begin' block, which applies a sequence of input stimuli to the inputs 'a' and 'b' with 5-unit time delays to exercise all input combinations (0+0, 0+1, 1+0, and 1+1). This block ultimately enables validation of the half-adder's response to input changes, ensuring its accuracy in producing the correct sum and carry outputs.",
