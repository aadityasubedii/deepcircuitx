    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'tb_half_adder' module is a testbench for validating a half-adder circuit. It sequentially drives pairs of single-bit input vectors ('a' and 'b') into an instantiated half-adder ('A1') and checks the output 'sum' and 'carry' for correctness. The inputs are applied with time delays to simulate different adding scenarios, and internal wires connect the half-adder's outputs to the testbench for result observation."
