Module name: half_adder. Module specification: The 'half_adder' module is a basic digital logic design implemented in Verilog, primarily used to add two single-bit binary numbers. It consists of two input ports, 'a' and 'b', which accept the binary digits to be added. The module generates two outputs: 'sum' and 'carry'. The 'sum' output is the result of a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation between 'a' and 'b', providing the sum of the inputs without considering the carry. On the other hand, the 'carry' output is derived from a bitwise AND operation of the same inputs and indicates a carry-over to the next significant bit if both 'a' and 'b' are set to 1. Internally, the module does not use any additional signals like wires or registers and directly computes the outputs using simple combinational logic assignments within the module. This minimalistic design makes the 'half_adder' module an essential component for constructing more complex arithmetic circuits, such as full adders or multi-bit binary adders.
