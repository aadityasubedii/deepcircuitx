The sum output is the result of the bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation of a and b, which represents the sum without considering any carry from the previous less significant bit. The carry output is the result of the bitwise AND operation of a and b, indicating if both inputs are 1 and there should be a carry to the next significant bit in a multi-bit addition scenario."
