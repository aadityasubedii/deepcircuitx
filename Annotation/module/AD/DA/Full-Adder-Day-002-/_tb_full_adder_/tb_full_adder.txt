Module-level comment: The `tb_full_adder` is a testbench for a full adder, verifying its operation by applying all possible 3-bit input combinations ('a', 'b', 'cin') and observing the 2-bit output ('sum', 'cout'). It cycles through inputs every 5ns, ensuring comprehensive testing of the full adder's functionality through direct instantiation and systematic input variation.
