Module name: tb_full_adder. Module specification: The `tb_full_adder` module is designed as a testbench for validating the functionality of a full adder circuit. The full adder's main task is to add together three one-bit numbers: 'a', 'b', and 'cin' (carry-in) to output a two-bit result composed of 'sum' and 'cout' (carry-out). Within this module, the input ports - 'a', 'b', and 'cin' serve as the inputs to the full adder, representing the bits to be added and the carry from any previous addition. The output ports - 'sum' and 'cout', provide the result of the addition ('sum') and the carry-out value ('cout') which could be forwarded as carry-in for an adjacent higher bit in larger addition operations. Internally, the module employs the mentioned signals to communicate with the instantiated full adder module `F1`, facilitating the testing of its operation by cycling through all possible combinations of input values, delayed by 5 time units each to carefully observe the full adder's behavior and ensure its correctness. The code is organized into an initial block that sequences through eight sets of input combinations to the full adder, showcasing an efficient setup for verifying the comprehensive operational integrity of the full adder logic under test.
