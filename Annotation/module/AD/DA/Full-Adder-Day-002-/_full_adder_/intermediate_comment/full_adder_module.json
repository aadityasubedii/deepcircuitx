    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'full_adder' module is a 1-bit adder in Verilog that computes the sum and carry-out of three input bits: 'a', 'b', and 'cin'. It directly assigns the result of 'a XOR b XOR cin' to 'sum' and uses '(a & b) | (b & cin) | (a & cin)' for 'cout', efficiently handling single-bit addition operations without internal signals."
