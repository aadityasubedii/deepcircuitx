Module name: full_adder. Module specification: The 'full_adder' module is a basic digital logic circuit implemented in Verilog, designed to perform a 1-bit addition operation. It accepts three input ports: 'a' and 'b' which are the significant bits to be added, and 'cin' which is the carry-in bit from a previous addition stage. The outputs of the module are 'sum' and 'cout'. The 'sum' output is generated using a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation on the inputs 'a', 'b', and 'cin', effectively summing the inputs while 'cout', the carry-out bit, is produced by evaluating whether at least two of the three input bits are '1', accomplished via a logical OR of three AND operations involving different pairs of the input bits. The module contains no internal signals and performs its computations directly through continuous assignments, making it a straightforward representation of a 1-bit full adder. The code is organized into a simple structure where input and output declarations are followed by the relevant logic assignments, aligning closely with fundamental digital design principles.
