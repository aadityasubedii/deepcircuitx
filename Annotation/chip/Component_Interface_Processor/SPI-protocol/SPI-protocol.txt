The SPI-protocol repository is designed to facilitate SPI data communication by implementing a robust SPI controller and its corresponding testbench. This repository houses modules that adeptly manage the communication between an SPI master and its device. The primary `spi_ctlr` module in the repository is responsible for handling data transactions via SPI, employing a meticulous state machine for managing SPI communication processes, such as clock generation, data transmission, and transaction management. It utilizes various blocks to handle aspects like clock control, state transitions, and data manipulation, while an assortment of internal registers and signals assist in storing necessary SPI transaction details temporarily. Complementantly, the repository includes a detailed `tb` module, functioning as a testbench for the SPI controller. This module provides comprehensive testing mechanisms by running simulations on different register addresses and data, implementing tasks for register operations, and setting up the initial blocks for clock and reset configurations. It systematically verifies the SPI controller's functionality to ensure its operational integrity. This dual-module approach not only enhances the SPI communication process but also ensures thorough validation and reliability of the system.
