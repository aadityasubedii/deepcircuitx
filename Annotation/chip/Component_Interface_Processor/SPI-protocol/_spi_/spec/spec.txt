Module name: spi_ctlr. 

Module specification: The `spi_ctlr` module is an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) controller implemented in Verilog. It operates in full duplex mode, controlling the SPI bus with a state machine to facilitate data transmission between the SPI master and the connected device. The module manages various functionalities such as resetting the controller, generating the SPI clock signal, and handling data read/write operations.

The module has several input ports namely `pclk_i`, `prst_i`, `pwrite_i`, `penable_i`, `paddr_i`, `pwdata_i`, `sclk_ref_i`, and `miso`. The purpose of these ports are to provide the system clock, reset signal, write enable, device enable, address input, data input, reference clock and MISO data respectively. The module also provides output ports that include `prdata_o`, `pready_o`, `pslverr_o`, `sclk`, `mosi`, and `cs` to read data, indicate readiness, flag errors and control SPI clock, MOSI data line, and Chip Select signal respectively.

It uses internal signals such as `addr_regA`, `data_regA`, `ctrl_reg`, and others to hold address, data, control bits, maintain the state of the SPI communication and other functionalities like SPI clock status, address and data to be sent over SPI bus, data read from SPI device, transactions count, etc.

The module consists of blocks that manage data and control flow including; a block to control SPI clock, a block to transition between different module states, a block for initial value assignment and data writing, and a block to handle SPI communication based on current state of the SPI controller which includes address and data driving to SPI device, reading data from a device and managing transactions. Each block contributes to overall control and functionality of the SPI controller.
