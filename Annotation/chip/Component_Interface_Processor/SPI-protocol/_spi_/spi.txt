Module-level comment: The `spi_ctlr` module is an SPI controller that handles SPI data communication between an SPI master and its device. It uses input and output ports for data writing, system clock, reset, device enabling and signaling error statuses. The module employs a state machine to manage various aspects of the SPI communication process, including SPI clock generation, data driving onto SPI bus, and managing SPI transactions. An array of internal registers and signals is used to temporarily store SPI register addresses, data, and control bits. The overall control and functionality is implemented through different blocks that manage clock control, state transitions, data writing, and SPI communication handling.
