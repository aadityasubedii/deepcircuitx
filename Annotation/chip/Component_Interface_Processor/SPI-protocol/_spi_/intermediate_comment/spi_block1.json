    "block_comment": "This Verilog block primarily orchestrates a state machine driven SPI protocol with different operational states like idle, address transmission and data transmission. In 'S_IDLE' state, the system initializes variables and decides if it needs to transition to the 'S_ADDR' state for address transmission. In 'S_ADDR' state, it begins clocking while driving the address data on MOSI and transitions to an idle state to introduce delay between address and data. In 'S_DATA' state, it either transmits or receives 8-bit data based on a flag bit in the address. Once data transmission is completed, the state either goes back to idle or proceeds with the next transaction ('S_IDLE_BW_TXS') depending on whether more data needs to be transported. Each state behaviour is defined within a case statement which is activated based on the current state and implements control flow for the SPI transactions."
