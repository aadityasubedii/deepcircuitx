    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a synchronous reset or a set of operations to perform for a Verilog RTL design. If a reset signal `prst_i` is high at a positive edge of `pclk_i`, it resets all components, sets signals, registers, and state to idle for future transactions. If reset is not active, it checks for the enable signal `penable_i`. If enabled, if the signal `pwrite_i` is high, it writes data `pwdata_i` to one of the three specific address ranges: address register `addr_regA`, data register `data_regA`, or control register `ctrl_reg` based on address `paddr_i` value. If `pwrite_i` is not active, it reads the data from the three specific address ranges based on `paddr_i` value and assigns it to `prdata_o`."
