    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block is responsible for state transition in a Finite State Machine (FSM). Specifically, it updates the current `state` based on the `next_state` value. Within the `always` block, the `state` is reassigned with the `next_state` value whenever `next_state` changes, ensuring the current `state` always reflects the most recent state. This is a fundamental part of controlling flow in FSM designs."
