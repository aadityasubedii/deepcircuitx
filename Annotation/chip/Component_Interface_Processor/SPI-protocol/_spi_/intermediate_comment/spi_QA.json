This module read/writes data from/to the internal registers of the SPI device. The SPI bus operates in full duplex mode with a single master. It controls the entire SPI bus using a state machine and includes various features for resetting the controller, generating the SPI clock signal, data read, write and addressing. It facilitates the transmission process with several states like IDLE, ADDR, DATA and intermediate idle states. Also, includes data and address registers to store data that needs to be sent."
