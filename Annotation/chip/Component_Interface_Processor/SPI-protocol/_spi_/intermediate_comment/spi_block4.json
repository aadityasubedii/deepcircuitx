    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the behavior of the system clock (sclk) based on the reference system clock input (sclk_ref_i) and the system clock running status (sclk_running). If the system clock is running, it updates the system clock with the reference input. Otherwise, it sets the system clock to a default value of 1."
