Comment: 
This block is a register write task in Verilog. It interacts with a register and writes a specific data to the desired address. The task uses signals for control like the positive edge of the clock signal, write enable signal, address, and data to be written to perform its function. When write and enable signals are set high, it waits for ready signal to convey completion of operation. After operation finished, it disables the write and enable signals and clears address and data inputs.
