    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to initialize specific system variables, perform a series of registered writes, and then conclude the program. First, the signals `prst_i`, `paddr_i`, `pwdata_i`, `pwrite_i`, `penable_i`, and `miso` are initialized to their default values. The simulation then waits for two positive edges of the `pclk_i` signal, after which `prst_i` is set to 0. The block procedurally writes increasing hex values into registers specified by the index variable `i` in two loops iterating `MAX_TXS` times. Further, it registers different values to the address `8'h20` with delay times of 300 and 1000 time units, causing system behavior changes. The code concludes with the `$finish` command, ending the simulation."
