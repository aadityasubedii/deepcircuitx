    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'tb' module, a testbench for the SPI controller, controls various tests through input signals and observes the resultant output signals. It achieves this via tasks for register write operations and initial blocks for clock signals and system resetting. It involves simulations for different register addresses and data, using internal states and parameters for SPI communication. The module finally verifies the correct operation of the controller."
