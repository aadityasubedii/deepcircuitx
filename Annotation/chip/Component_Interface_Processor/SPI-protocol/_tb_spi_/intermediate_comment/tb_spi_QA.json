The testbench module 'tb' defines key parameters, registers, and wires needed to simulate the behavior of the SPI controller. The module further contains initial blocks to generate clock signals and reset the SPI controller. Moreover, it uses a task \"reg_write\" for the purpose of writing data to registers. This module tests various functionalities of the SPI controller by writing to its registers multiple times with different data, hence ensuring its correct operation in different scenarios. After all tests are run, the simulation finishes. It serves as a necessary tool for verifying the functionality of the SPI controller before it's implemented in a real-world scenario."

This is used to reset the system.\n3. pwrite_i: Signal to instruct when to write to a register.\n4. penable_i: Enable signal to allow the SPI controller to communicate.\n5. paddr_i: This is the address signal input of a register where data will be written.\n6. pwdata_i: This is the register data writing input signal.\n7. sclk_ref_i: This input is the reference signal for the SPI clock.\n8. miso: The Master In Slave Out signal.
