The module has two input ports, 'In1' and 'In2', and one output port 'out'. 'In1' and 'In2' are the operands for the addition operation, and 'out' is used to register the final result of the addition. An internal register 'temp' is used to hold the intermediate sum of the input operands. The module operates in a continuous loop, monitored by the 'always' block. Within this block, the sum of the signed values of 'In1' and 'In2' is assigned to 'temp'. In the final part of the module, the value of 'temp' is assigned to 'out', which completes the operations of the adder module. The module serves the functionality to deliver the sum of two 16-bit signed numbers via the aforementioned operation.",
