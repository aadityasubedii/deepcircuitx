Module-level comment: This 'adder' module performs addition of two 16-bit signed inputs 'In1' and 'In2'. The operands are continuously evaluated in an 'always' block, adding their signed values and holding the result in the internal register 'temp'. The module then assigns the calculated intermediate result from 'temp' to the output register 'out'. Thus, implementing a 16-bit adder hardware operation.
