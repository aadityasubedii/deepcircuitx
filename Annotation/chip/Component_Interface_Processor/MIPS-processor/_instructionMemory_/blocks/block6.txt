Comment: 
This block of Verilog code serves as a clock signal generator. Initially, the state of the clock signal (CLK) is undefined, hence the use of the initial block. The always block, operating with a delay of 5 time units, continually flips the value of the CLK signal between 0 and 1, generating a square wave which serves as a clock pulse for the digital circuit. This clock signal is essential for the synchronization of different components in the circuit. The hash (#) notation in Verilog represents an absolute delay, ensuring the consistent periodicity of the clock signal.
