Module-level comment for stimulus: This module _stimulus_ is a testbench driving the Instruction_Memory module by manipulating the 'instructionAdd' and CLK signal at distinct instants and displaying the fetched 'instruction'. CLK functions as a clock signal, flipping regularly, while 'instructionAdd' specifies the address line for data fetch in the Instruction_Memory module.

Module-level comment for Instruction_Memory: Module _Instruction_Memory_ mimics a synchronous memory with 256 addressable 16-bit registers, fetching data from the registers' address pointed by 'instructionAdd' during the clock's positive edge. The registers are initially set with values matching their address. The fetched data is copied to 'tempA' and eventually assigned to the output 'instruction', making the module a practical realization of an instruction memory in processors.
