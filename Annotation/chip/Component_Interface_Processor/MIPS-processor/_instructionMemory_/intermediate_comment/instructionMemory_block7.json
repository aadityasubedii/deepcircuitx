    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for setting the value of the clock signal (CLK) initially to zero. This is done by using the 'initial' Verilog keyword and then assigning the clock signal to a binary value of zero using the assignment operator '=', meaning that the clock signal begins at a low logic level when the simulation starts."
