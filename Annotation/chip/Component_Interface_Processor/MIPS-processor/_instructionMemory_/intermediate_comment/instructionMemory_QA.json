The names of the modules are \"stimulus\" and \"Instruction_Memory\".\n\n    Explanation for stimulus module: This module acts as a driver for Instruction_Memory module. It periodically changes the value of instructionAdd variable in a specified timeline and displays the \"instruction\" after each change. It instantiates the Instruction_Memory module and provides signals to it.\n\n    Explanation for Instruction_Memory module: This module takes an address (instructionAdd) and clock signals as input. It simulates a synchronous memory array with 256 (16-bit) registers which are initialized to values equal to their addresses. On the positive edge of the clock, it reads the data from the memory using the address (instructionAdd) and assigns it to the instruction signal (output). This is a simple model of instruction memory in processors where the address line is fed with the value of the instruction pointer, and it returns the instruction at that memory location."

This clock signal is provided as an input to the Instruction_Memory module.\n- instructionAdd: This signal is serving as an instruction address which is used to read the instruction/data from the memory in Instruction_Memory module. In the testing scenario provided in the stimulus module, the value of instructionAdd is manually changed at certain time units.\n\nFor the \"Instruction_Memory\" module:\n\n1. Internal Signals: registers, tempA, i\nExplanation:\n- registers: This is a memory array of 256 16-bit registers. These registers initially store values equal to their addresses in the setup. These registers simulate the memory from where instruction/data is to be read.\n- tempA: This signal is used as a temporary variable to store the instruction/data read from the register on the rising edge of the clock cycle.
