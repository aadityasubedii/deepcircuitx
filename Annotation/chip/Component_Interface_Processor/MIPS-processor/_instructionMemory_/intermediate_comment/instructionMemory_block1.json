    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code assigns the value of `tempA` to `instruction`. This means the previous value of `instruction` is overwritten with whatever value `tempA` currently holds. The `assign` statement provides continuous assignment, meaning whenever there is a change in the `tempA` value, the `instruction` value will be changed accordingly and instantaneously. The scope of the variables `instruction` and `tempA` should be determined by the context in the surrounding code."
