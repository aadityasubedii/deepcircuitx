    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block initializes a register array with values equal to their index. It begins by initiating a loop where each index 'i' of the 'registers' array, from 0 to 255 (256 in total), is assigned the value of the index number itself. So, register[0] will store 0, register[1] will store 1, and so on, until register[255] which will store 255."
