Module name: stimulus. Module specification: The "stimulus" module offers periodic changes to the value of the 'instructionAdd' variable on a specified timeline and displays the "instruction" after each modification. This module does not possess any input or output ports as it is programmed as a testbench to stimulate the Instruction_Memory module. Internally, it uses two signals - CLK and instructionAdd. CLK acts as a clock signal, toggling its state every 5-time units to simulate a clock cycle, while 'instructionAdd' serves as an instruction address. In the code blocks of this module, the CLK signal is constantly flipped, the simulation is terminated after 1000-time units, and the Instruction_Memory module is instantiated. Furthermore, the instructionAdd signal is explicitly manipulated at certain time-units for testing purposes. 

Module name: Instruction_Memory. Module specification: The "Instruction_Memory" module simulates a synchronous memory array, containing 256 16-bit registers initially equal to their addresses. On the positive edge of the clock signal, it reads data from a specific register using the address line. It takes two inputs - 'instructionAdd', a 16-bit instruction address line, and 'clock', the clock signal for data reading. The module has an output named 'instruction', a 16-bit signal transmitting the fetched data from memory. Internally, it has a register array 'registers', a temporary 16-bit register 'tempA', and a loop variable 'i'. 'registers' directly simulate the memory for data instruction reading. The 'instructionAdd' points at the memory location in 'registers' to take the data and store it in 'tempA', which is then assigned to 'instruction'. Lastly, 'i' is used to initialize the 'registers' with their address values in a for loop at the start. Thus, the module effectively represents a simplified model of instruction memory in processors where the address line is assigned the value of the instruction pointer, and it returns the instruction found at the related memory location.
