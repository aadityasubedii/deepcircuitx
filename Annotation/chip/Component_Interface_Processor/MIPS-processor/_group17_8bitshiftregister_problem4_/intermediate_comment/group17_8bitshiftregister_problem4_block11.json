    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code initializes the clock signal. It sets the starting value of the Clock (CLK) as low (0). The initial keyword indicates that this block will only be run once, at the beginning of the simulation. The always keyword signifies that the code inside this block will be executed continuously throughout the simulation. The clock signal is generally used to control timing of various operations in synchronous digital systems."
