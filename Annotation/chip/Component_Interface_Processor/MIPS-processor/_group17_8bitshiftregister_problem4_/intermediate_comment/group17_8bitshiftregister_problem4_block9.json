    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block represents a simulation termination command. Using the `initial` keyword in conjunction with the system task `$finish`, it completes the simulation after a delay of 1000 time units. However, the exact duration of these time units (in real time) is determined by the 'timescale directive. This implementation is typically used in testbenches for terminating the simulation after the intended test cases have run to completion."
