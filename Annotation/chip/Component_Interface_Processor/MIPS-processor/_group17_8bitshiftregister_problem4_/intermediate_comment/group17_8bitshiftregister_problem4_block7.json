    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily functions to carry out a direct mapping of inputs to corresponding outputs. It implements this operation by using the \"assign\" keyword to map each input 'in[n]' to a corresponding output 'in1[n]'. Commensurate indexes of input & output vectors are associated with each other for direct data transfer."
