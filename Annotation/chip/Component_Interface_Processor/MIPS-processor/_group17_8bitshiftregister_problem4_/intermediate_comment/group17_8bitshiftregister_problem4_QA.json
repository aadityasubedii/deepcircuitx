Explanation: This module serves as a testbench for an 8-bit universal shift register (`eight_bit_UniversalShiftRegister`). It provides specific inputs and outputs, simulating various test conditions for the 8-bit universal shift register. This module sets the registers and clock, manages end conditions, and displays outputs after each test condition. \n\n2. Module name: eight_bit_UniversalShiftRegister. Explanation: This module forms an 8-bit Universal Shift Register by composite of two 4-bit Universal Shift Registers (`four_bit_UniversalShiftRegister`). It divides 8-bit input into two 4-bit inputs which are then being fed into `four_bit_UniversalShiftRegister` modules. The outputs from these two modules are then being assigned back as an 8-bit output. \n\n3. Module name: four_bit_UniversalShiftRegister. Explanation: This module forms a 4-bit Universal Shift Register. It accepts a 4-bit input, and controls the shifting operation (no shift, shift left, shift right and parallel load) based on the control signals. The shifted values are then assigned as 4-bit output. The module leverages clock events and shift operations are conditional based on enable and control inputs."
