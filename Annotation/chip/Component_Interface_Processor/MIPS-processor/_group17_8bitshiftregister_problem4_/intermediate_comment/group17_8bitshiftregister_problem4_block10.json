    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for generating a clock signal in a testing environment. The \"always #5 CLK = ~CLK\" statement is used to invert the current state of the 'CLK' after every 5 units of delay, thus generating a clock pulse. This occurs continuously throughout the simulation. The \"initial\" keyword indicates the start of an initial block, but since the block is empty, it does not impact the behavior of the code."
