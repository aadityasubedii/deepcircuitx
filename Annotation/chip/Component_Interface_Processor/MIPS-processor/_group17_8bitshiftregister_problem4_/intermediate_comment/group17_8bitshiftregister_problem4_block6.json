    "block_comment": "This code block functions as a bit-slicing mechanism, selectively taking certain index bits from the 'in' bus and assigning them to the 'in2' bus. Specifically, it transfers the 5th to the 8th index bits from the 'in' bus to the 'in2' bus at indices 0 to 3, reordering the bit positions in the process."
