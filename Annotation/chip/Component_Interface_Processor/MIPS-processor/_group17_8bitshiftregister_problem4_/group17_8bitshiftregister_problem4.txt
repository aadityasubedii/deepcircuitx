Module-level comment: The `eight_bit_UniversalShiftRegister` performs 8-bit shift/load operations using composite `four_bit_UniversalShiftRegister` modules. It splits the 8-bit input into 4-bit halves, which are processed in separate `four_bit_UniversalShiftRegister` modules. The 4-bit outputs are recombined into the 8-bit output. Control signal inputs dictate the type of operation while enable input controls operation occurrence. Shift operations involve temporary storage variables within the 4-bit modules. The `stimulus` module sets initial conditions and visually verifies operations, making it a testbench.
