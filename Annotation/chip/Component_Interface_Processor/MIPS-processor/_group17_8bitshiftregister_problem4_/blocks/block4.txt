This block of code merges two 4-bit vectors into a single 8-bit vector. The first four bits of the output, out[0] to out[3], are assigned from the vector out1. The next four bits, out[4] to out[7], are assigned from the vector out2. This is achieved using individual assignment statements in Verilog, creating a larger vector of data from two smaller vectors.
