Comment: 
The block instantiates two four-bit universal shift registers shift1 and shift2. Shift1 operates on input 'in1' and 'in[4]'. 'out1' is the output, 'c0' and 'c1' specify the operation mode, 'clk' is the clock signal, 'enb' enables the operation, 'sli' is the serial load input. Similarly, Shift2 operates on 'in2' and 'sri', with 'out2' as the output. 'in[3]' serves as the serial load input for Shift2 in contrast to 'in[4]' in Shift1.
