This block defines a 4-bit Universal Shift Register module in Verilog. The block takes a 4-bit input, two control inputs (c0, c1), clock signal, enable signal (enb), shift left input (sli), and shift right input (sri). The Shift Register can perform left or right shift operation based on the control signals. The registers 'tempo1' to 'tempo4' are used as temporary storage during shift operations. The shifting operation is enabled by the 'enb' enable signal with respect to the provided clock signal (clk). The module output is a 4-bit output. This block is the basic setup - the actual shift operation control logic is not included in this block. Please reference the original code for shift operation details.
