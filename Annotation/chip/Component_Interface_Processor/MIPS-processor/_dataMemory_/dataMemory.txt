Module-level comment: The Data_Memory module is a storage unit capable of storing and retrieving data based on commands. Using a register array of 1024 16-bit entries ('registers') for storage, the module writes data from 'dataIn' to the addressed register ('dataInAdd') when 'regWrite' is active and retrieves the data from the addressed register when 'regRead' is active, both on the clock's rising edge. Data read is output through 'dataOut'. Functionality is achieved by internal conditional checks within an 'always' block, driven by the clock signal.
