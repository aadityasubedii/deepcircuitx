    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a clock signal generator. The 'always' construct in Verilog is used to continuously produce a clock signal with a period of ten time units. The '#5' delay control sign signifies that the clock ('CLK') signal will toggle its state every five time units, effectively producing a square wave output (high for 5 time units, then low for the next 5, etc.). This makes this block an essential component for sequential circuit simulations and designs where a repetitive signal is needed."
