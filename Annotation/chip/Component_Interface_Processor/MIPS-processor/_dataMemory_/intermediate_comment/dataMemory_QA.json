The output is displayed to monitor the correctness of the operations.\n   \n   - The \"Data_Memory\" module serves as a simple storage unit that stores and retrieves data on command. It uses a register array (\"registers\") as its main storage block. The module is capable of writing data to a register defined by 'dataInAdd' when 'regWrite' signal is active. Similarly, it reads data from a register defined by 'dataInAdd' and sets it on the output 'dataOut' when the 'regRead' signal is active.

If this signal is active (i.e., 1), the data from 'dataIn' input will be written into the register addressed by 'dataInAdd'.\n\n- regRead: This is a single-bit input that serves as a read enable signal. If this signal is active (i.e., 1), the data from the register addressed by 'dataInAdd' will be set on the dataOut output.\n\n- clock: This is the input clock signal which controls the pace of read/write operations.
