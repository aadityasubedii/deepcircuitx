    "block_comment": "The particular block of code executes register read and write operations based on the control signals `regRead` and `regWrite`. At each positive edge of the clock, the block checks whether the `regRead` or `regWrite` control signals are high. If `regRead` is high, it forwards the data from the `registers` array at the index `dataInAdd` to the `Out` output port. If `regWrite` is high, it writes the input `dataIn` to the `registers` array at the index `dataInAdd`."
