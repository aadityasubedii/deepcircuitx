    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for terminating the simulation after a specific amount of time elapses. Specifically, it waits for the passage of 1000 units of simulation time (denoted by the '#1000' syntax), before invoking the '$finish' system task to stop the simulation. This is typically used in testbenches to limit simulation duration to a fixed point in time."
