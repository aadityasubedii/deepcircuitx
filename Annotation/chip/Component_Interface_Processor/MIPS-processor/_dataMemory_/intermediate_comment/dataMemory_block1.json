    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning the value of 'Out' to the 'dataOut' signal. Through the use of the `assign` keyword, the Verilog RTL block ensures the 'dataOut' will always be equal to the current value of 'Out'. This results in automatic, continuous data monitoring and transfer, ensuring 'dataOut' accurately and immediately reflects any changes in 'Out'."
