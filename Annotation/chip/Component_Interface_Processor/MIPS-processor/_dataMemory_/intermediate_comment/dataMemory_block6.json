    "block_comment": "The block of code initializes clock signal (CLK) to low in digital logic design. In implementation, it uses the initial construct of Verilog HDL to assign \"1'b0\" (binary value of 0) to clock signal CLK, indicating that simulation should begin with CLK set to a FALSE or low state, simulating an asynchronous reset which is a common practice in digital logic design."
