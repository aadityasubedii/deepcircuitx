    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions to perform read and write operations on a register. Initially, the code begins by setting regWrite to 1 and regRead to 0, while loading a specific dataInAdd and dataIn value, simulating a write operation. After a delay, the code sets regRead to 1 and regWrite to 0 for the same dataInAdd, ensuring a read operation on the previously written value. Display statements are used to check dataOut after each read operation. This same process is repeated for another dataInAdd and dataIn value pair as a different test scenario."
