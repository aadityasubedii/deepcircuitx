Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used to generate a clock signal. It does so by continuously toggling a signal called `CLK`. This is accomplished through the use of an `always` block combined with the `#5` delay control statement which waits for a certain amount of time (5 time units in this case). The `CLK` signal is then inverted at regular intervals using the bitwise negation operator `~`, resulting in a periodic changing of the signal value between 0 and 1 which resembles a clock signal.
