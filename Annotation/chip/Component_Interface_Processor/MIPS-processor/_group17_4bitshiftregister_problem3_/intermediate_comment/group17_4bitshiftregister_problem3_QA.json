The \"stimulus\" module is a testbench used for verifying the functionality of the \"four_bit_UniversalShiftRegister\" module. It initializes different input signals of the four-bit universal shift register and then changes these signals at different times to test the reaction of the shift register. The register's output is displayed for each set of inputs. \n\n2. The \"four_bit_UniversalShiftRegister\" module implements a four-bit universal shift register. A universal shift register is a type of register that can perform different types of operations. In this module, based on the control input signals c1 and c0, and enabled by enb, it performs different data shifting operations on a 4-bit input 'in'. The four operations include - do nothing, shift right with serial input at leftmost bit from sri, shift left with serial input at rightmost bit from sli, or perform parallel load, respectively. It uses four temporary storage variables (tempo1, tempo2, tempo3, tempo4) to hold the intermediate values during the shift or load operation. The final four-bit output is assigned from these four temporary variables."
