Comment: 
This block of code essentially performs a reset, register read and conditional load function in a hardware system. At the beginning, when a 'clear' signal is triggered, the system resets all registers to 0. The reading function is performed next: the values stored in registers indexed by `Aadd` and `Badd` are fetched and assigned to `tempA` and `tempB` respectively. Lastly, when a 'load' signal is detected, the code conditionally writes the value of `Cin` into the register indexed by `Cadd`. The definition and handling of all signals are synchronized with the rising edge of the 'clock' or the 'clear'.
