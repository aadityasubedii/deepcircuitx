Comment: 
This block generates a clock signal with a period of 10 time units. To achieve this, the original clock signal is flipped ('~' operator) every 5 time units within an 'always' block, creating a clock signal that alternates between high and low every 5 time units, which gives it a complete cycle of period 10.
