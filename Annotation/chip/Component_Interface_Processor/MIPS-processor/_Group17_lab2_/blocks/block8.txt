This block of code initializes a digital clock signal. Specifically, it sets the initial value of the clock signal to low ('0') at the beginning of the simulation. This is accomplished by using the 'initial' keyword to specify conditions at the start, and setting the binary value of the clock to '0' using the '1'b0' statement.
