    "block_comment": "The function of this block of code is assigning the value of 'tempB' to the wire or reg 'Bout'. The content of 'tempB', being either a wire, reg, or more complex data type, is transferred to 'Bout'. Implementing this in Verilog is done using the assign keyword, which creates a continuous assignment statement. Beyond the provided single line of code, context, such as the definitions and use of 'tempB' and 'Bout', would be required to give a more detailed description."
