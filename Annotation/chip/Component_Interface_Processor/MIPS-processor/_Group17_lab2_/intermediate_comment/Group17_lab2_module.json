    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"stimulus\" module serves as a test environment, driving the clock, data, and control signals to the \"register_file\" module. The \"register_file\" module simulates a CPU register file, providing read and write operations for an array of 16, 16-bit registers addressed by Aadd, Badd, and Cadd. Write operations are performed if 'load' signal is active, read operations output data on Aout and Bout signals. The 'clear' signal resets all registers to zero. The modules are synchronized using a clock signal, with operations performed on a clock's rising edge."
