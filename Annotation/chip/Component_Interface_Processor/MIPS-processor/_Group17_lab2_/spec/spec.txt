Module name: stimulus and register_file. 

Module specification: 

The "stimulus" module serves as a testbench for the "register_file" module. It controls the clock timing, data loading, and reset functionality specifically for a register file system. The code is effectively two separate modules - "stimulus" and "register_file". The "stimulus" module does not have any input or output ports. It uses the internal signals clock, clear, load, Aadd, Badd, and Cadd (which act as addresses for registers) to control the operations of the system. The internal signals Aout and Bout are used to display the data read from the register file. 

The "register_file" module is a simulation of a register file in a CPU. It is capable of storing and retrieving data through addresses. The inputs for this module are read addresses (Aadd and Badd), write address (Cadd), input data (Cin), and control signals (load, clear). It also uses the clock signal to coordinate the write or read operation in sync with the external system. The outputs from this module are data outputs (Aout and Bout). Internally, it manages a register array, temporary variables (tempA, tempB), and counters for its loops. The module is capable of clearing or loading the content of each register when the relevant signals are active.
