Module name: ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).

Module specification: The ALU module performs various arithmetic and logical operations based on the input it receives. This module is essential for calculating operations like addition, subtraction, AND, OR, set if less than (SLT), and unsigned addition. The module is expecting input data in a 16-bit format, and whether or not an operation is performed is governed by the bit controls 'aluOpB1', 'aluOpB2', and 'aluOpB3'.

Input and output ports include data inputs 'dataIn1', 'dataIn2', control inputs 'aluActiveIn', 'aluOpB1', 'aluOpB2', 'aluOpB3', and data outputs 'dataOut', 'zero', 'cOut', 'lt', 'gt', 'overflow', 'cIn'. The data inputs signify the two 16-bit data on which the arithmetic or logical operations are performed, whereas the control inputs are used for dictating the type of operation to be conducted. The data outputs represent the 16-bit result of an operation, flags for zero, less than and greater than comparison, status of overflow, carry out, and carry in.

Internally, the module uses signals such as 'temp1', 'temp2', 'temp3', 'temp4', 'cIn' and others mainly for holding intermediate results, flags, and overflow statuses. These temporary registers are crucial in performing operations and checking conditions.

The code is structured into different conditional blocks, where each block corresponds to a specific ALU operation - addition, subtraction, AND, OR, SLT, and unsigned addition. Each conditional block is governed by a specific combination of the 'ALUActiveIn', 'aluOpB1', 'aluOpB2', and 'aluOpB3' control signals. Every block performs its operation, calculates flags and status bits, outputting the result.
