Comment: 
This block of code is the definition of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) module in Verilog. The ALU takes in two 16-bit data inputs, 'dataIn1' and 'dataIn2', as well as boolean ALU activity and three ALU operation flags. It produces a 16-bit data output, 'dataOut', and several output flags including 'zero', 'cOut', 'lt', 'gt', 'overflow', and 'cIn'. The module also includes several internal registers, 'temp1', 'temp2', 'temp3', and 'temp4' for temporary storage during operations. However, the code block provided does not suggest the specific ALU operations carried out on the input data.
