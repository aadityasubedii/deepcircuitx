This block of Verilog code is used to define a testbench run-time. At 1000 time units mark into the simulation, the `$finish` system task is called which effectively ends the simulation. Note that the time delay `#1000` denotes the wait of 1000 time-units before `$finish` executes. The number of time units depends on the `timescale` directive set at the beginning of the code.
