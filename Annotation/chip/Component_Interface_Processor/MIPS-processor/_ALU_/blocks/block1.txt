This code block is essentially a multifunction arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs different operations such as addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations (AND and OR) based on the control inputs. When the ALU is active and by varying the aluOpB bits, different operations are executed on the inputs. For example, when aluOpB[3:1] bits are '000', the block performs addition whereas '001' forces the block to do subtraction and so forth. Resulting conditions such as if the result is equal to zero or if there is an overflow are also determined within each operation. The selected output operation is stored in dataOut and other flags (zero, overflow, cIn, cOut, lt and gt) are set accordingly.
