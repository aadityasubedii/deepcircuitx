    "module": "Module-level comment: The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) module performs arithmetic and logical operations on 16-bit inputs, governed by an activation bit and ALU operation bits. Depending on operation bits 'aluOpB1', 'aluOpB2', 'aluOpB3', the module executes addition, subtraction, AND, OR, SLT, or unsigned addition. Outputs include operation result, flags for zero comparison, and carry out/overflow statuses. Internal registers hold intermediate calculations. Different control signal combinations trigger corresponding operations in dedicated code blocks, achieving the functionality."
