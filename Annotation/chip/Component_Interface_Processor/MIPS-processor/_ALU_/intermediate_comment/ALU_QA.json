The operations include addition, subtraction, AND, OR, SLT (set if less than), and an unsigned addition. The module expects the incoming data to be 16-bit and the operations to be performed are dictated by the bits aluOpB1, aluOpB2, and aluOpB3. For addition and subtraction, any overflow and carry out are calculated and the module can determine if the result is less than, greater than, or equal to zero. For logical operations, the module only calculates if the result will lead to a 'less than', 'greater than', or 'equal to zero' condition. This module does not directly output a result, but updates the status of different flags/arithmetic results based on the operation performed."
