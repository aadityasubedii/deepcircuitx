    "block_comment": "The Verilog block sets up a series of test scenarios. For each scenario, it invokes arithmetical logic unit (ALU) operations for testing calculations and system functions. The block achieves its function by setting test-specific bit-level values for binary variables, followed by an operation invocation with a delay of 1 time unit. It then displays the resulting output, covering operations including addition, subtraction, logical AND, OR, SLT instruction and unsigned additions. The values for the inputs' data and operation instructions `aluOpB1`, `aluOpB2`, and `aluOpB3` are set distinctively for each test situation to evaluate various corner cases of the system."
