Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used to terminate the simulation. The simulation execution is set to complete after a delay of 1000 simulation time units, implemented through the 'initial' keyword, which initiates the process at the beginning of the simulation, and the system task '$finish', which is used to stop the simulation.
