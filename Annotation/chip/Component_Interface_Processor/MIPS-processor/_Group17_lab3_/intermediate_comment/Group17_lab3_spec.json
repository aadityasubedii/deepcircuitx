It has multiple outputs - Out0, Out1, Out2, Out3, Out4, Out5A, Out5B, Out5C, Out5Active, Out6, Out7, Out8.\n\nThe 'stimulus' module contains reg s0, s1, s2, s3, CLK as internal signals. 'CLK' serves as a clock source for generating tests in a timed sequence. s0, s1, s2, s3 are the control signals for the 'KURM_controller' module.\n\nIn 'KURM_controller', out0, out1, out2, out3, out4, out5A, out5B, out5C, out5Active, out6, out7, out8 are internal signals computed on the positive edge of the clock and assigned to corresponding output ports.\n\nThe 'KURM_controller' module has an always block which manages the configuration of outputs based on control signals and a series of assign statements align internal signals with output ports. Different blocks of code in the 'KURM_controller' module cater to separate operations. \n\nOn the other hand, the 'stimulus' module includes a test bench which generates a sequence of tests using combinations of control signals s0, s1, s2, s3 at clock's positive edge, one for each operation being tested.",

It has multiple outputs - Out0, Out1, Out2, Out3, Out4, Out5A, Out5B, Out5C, Out5Active, Out6, Out7, Out8.\n\nThe 'stimulus' module contains reg s0, s1, s2, s3, CLK as internal signals. 'CLK' serves as a clock source for generating tests in a timed sequence. s0, s1, s2, s3 are the control signals for the 'KURM_controller' module.\n\nIn 'KURM_controller', out0, out1, out2, out3, out4, out5A, out5B, out5C, out5Active, out6, out7, out8 are internal signals computed on the positive edge of the clock and assigned to corresponding output ports.\n\nThe 'KURM_controller' module has an always block which manages the configuration of outputs based on control signals and a series of assign statements align internal signals with output ports. Different blocks of code in the 'KURM_controller' module cater to separate operations. \n\nOn the other hand, the 'stimulus' module includes a test bench which generates a sequence of tests using combinations of control signals s0, s1, s2, s3 at clock's positive edge, one for each operation being tested."
