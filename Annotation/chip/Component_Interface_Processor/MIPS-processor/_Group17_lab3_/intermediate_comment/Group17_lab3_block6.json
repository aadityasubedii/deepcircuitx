    "block_comment": "The purpose of the block of code is to initialize the CLK signal to a low state. The implementation of this is done using Verilog's 'initial' and 'always' constructs. The 'initial' keyword is used to set up initial conditions, and the 'always' keyword is, in this case, used to create an infinite loop, tied to some event or condition, but here it is left empty, presumably to be filled in with future conditions."
