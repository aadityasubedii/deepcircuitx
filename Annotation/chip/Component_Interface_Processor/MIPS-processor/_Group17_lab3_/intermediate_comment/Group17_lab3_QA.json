Through various tests, it changes the states of input signals s0, s1, s2, s3 and checks the outputs. Each test corresponds to a different operation like ADD, SUB, AND, OR, SLT, LW, SW, BNE, JMP, etc.\n\nThe 'KURM_controller' module is a clocked combinational circuit. This module has several input signals (s0, s1, s2, s3, clock) and several output signals. The task of this module is to assign to each output a specific value (1 or 0), according to the combinational value of s0, s1 s2, s3 given on each clock's positive edge. The functionality of each set of input combinations is not directly clear from the code but can be inferred from the 'stimulus' module tests."
