    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a clock signal for digital circuits. It uses the 'always' construct together with the delay control '#5' to periodically toggle the state of 'CLK'. The initial value is assumed to be '0' so after every 5 units of simulation time, the signal 'CLK' inverts, mimicking the behavior of a digital clock signal."
