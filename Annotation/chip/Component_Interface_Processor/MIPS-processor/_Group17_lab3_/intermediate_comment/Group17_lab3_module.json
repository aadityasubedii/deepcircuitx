    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'stimulus' and 'KURM_controller' modules work together to test different operations on control signals s0, s1, s2, s3. The 'stimulus' module generates control signals and applies them to the 'KURM_controller'. The 'KURM_controller' configures its outputs based on these control signals at each positive clock edge, simulating various operations like ADD, SUB, AND, etc. Each distinct operation in the 'KURM_controller' is modeled within a case statement, and the corresponding outputs are assigned values that model different operations."
