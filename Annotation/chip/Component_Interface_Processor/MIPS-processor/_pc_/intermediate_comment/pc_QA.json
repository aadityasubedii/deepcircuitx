It toggles a clock signal (`CLK`) and feeds different input addresses (`inaddr`) to that module while printing the output address from that module for verification purposes. \n\nFor the second module:\n\nModule name: programmecounter. \nExplanation: This module takes an input address (`inaddr`) and a clock signal. On the rising edge of the clock, it increments a register `temp` by the value of `inaddr`. The value of `temp` is then assigned to the output address `outaddr`.
