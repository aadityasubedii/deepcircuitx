    "block_comment": "The block of code has two main components. The first line is an initial block that sets the CLK (Clock) to low (0) at the beginning of the simulation. The second \u2018always\u2019 keyword is used to start a procedural block, which allows the modeling of sequential circuit elements or any logic that requires memory. However, this 'always' block seems incomplete and would typically contain the timing control statements and the logic of the block which gets executed when the event (or events) in the timing control statement occurs."
