    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'programmecounter' module is a simple address accumulator, incrementing an internal 16-bit register `temp` by the value of input address `inaddr` at each rising edge of the input clock. This accumulated value is then assigned to the output `outaddr`. In a broader context, this module is utilized by 'stimulus', a higher-level module, for writing tests and validating the functionality of 'programmecounter' by providing specific `inaddr` inputs and monitoring the corresponding `outaddr` outputs."
