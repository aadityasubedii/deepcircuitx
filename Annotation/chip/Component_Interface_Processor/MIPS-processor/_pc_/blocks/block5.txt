This block of code represents a clock generator. The clock generator functions by continuously toggling the state of the "CLK" signal every 5 time units, effectively producing a clock signal with a period of 10 time units. Its operation is implemented simply with a non-blocking assignment that negates the current state of the CLK signal inside an always loop with the delay specified.
