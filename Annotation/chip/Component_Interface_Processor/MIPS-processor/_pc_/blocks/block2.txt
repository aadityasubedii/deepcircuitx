Comment: 
The block of code implements a synchronous accumulator functionality, which accumulates the signed input "inaddr" on every positive edge of "clock". This is achieved by using the 'always' keyword with 'posedge clock' to ensure the desired operation at every positive clock cycle when the clock transitions from a low to a high level. The '$signed' system function is used to interpret the 'inaddr' and 'temp' as signed numbers, and the sum is stored back in 'temp'.
