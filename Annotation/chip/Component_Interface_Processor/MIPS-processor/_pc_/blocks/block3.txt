This block of Verilog RTL code is a testbench utilized for testing specific functionalities of a digital system by providing specified input and displaying output. It does so by initially setting a 16-bit 'inaddr' to a value and then displaying the corresponding 'outaddr' value. After a certain delay time (given in terms of simulation ticks '#'), it changes the value of 'inaddr' and again displays the resulting 'outaddr' for this updated input. The display is used for verification and debugging purposes.
