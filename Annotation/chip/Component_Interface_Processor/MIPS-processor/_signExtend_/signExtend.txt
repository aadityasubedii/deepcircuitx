Module-level comment: The Sign_Extend module performs sign extension on an 8-bit input signal to a 16-bit output. The module achieves this via a central always block, which monitors changes in the input signal. Based on the sign bit of the input, the high-order bits of the output signal are filled with the appropriate binary value (0 for positive and 1 for negative inputs). The sign-extended output is held in a temporary register, tempA, and then assigned to dataOut. This module also incorporates a loop to perform the bit-wise operations. Simulation data is provided by a separate 'stimulus' testbench module.
