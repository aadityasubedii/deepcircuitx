    "spec": "Module name: Sign_Extend. Module specification: The Sign_Extend module has the functionalities of extending the sign bit of an 8-bit input signal to produce a 16-bit output signal. The module takes a single 8-bit input (dataIn), checks the most significant bit of this input, and generates an output (dataOut) that is a 16-bit signal, with the sign bit extended to fill the high-order bits. The input port of this module is dataIn, which holds the 8-bit input signal that will be sign extended. The output port is dataOut, which delivers the sign-extended version of the input signal. In terms of internal signals, the module uses a 16-bit register (tempA) to hold the sign-extended value of the input and an integer-type signal (count) which is employed inside a loop to iterate over the bits of the input and output signals. This module has an always block which is sensitive to the changes in the input signal (dataIn). Inside this block, the most significant bit of the input is checked, and depending on whether it's 0 or 1, the high-order bits of the output are set to 0 or 1, respectively. Finally, the output signal (dataOut) is assigned the value of the internal signal tempA. Notably, this module is tested using a stimulus module where different binary inputs are applied, and the outputs are displayed to the console to examine the behaviour of Sign_Extend module.",

It defines two data signals, dataOut and dataIn, as well as a clock signal CLK. It initializes these signals and then applies two different binary input values to the dataIn signal. The purpose of this is to examine the behavior of the \"Sign_Extend\" module under different input scenarios that are displayed as Test1 and Test2.\n\nModule 2:\nModule name: Sign_Extend\nExplanation: This module takes an 8-bit input signal and extends its sign to provide a 16-bit output signal.
