    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block serves for simulation testing of a module. It pushes two 8-bit binary data inputs into the module sequentially with a delay of 1 time unit between each operation, and then displays the corresponding output from the module. The binary data inputs are '00111101' and '10111101'. Because the outputs aren't specified in this block, it is inferred that the module's operation with the inputs generates the outputs. The overall mechanism provides a rudimentary functional verification of the module under test to ensure it behaves as expected."
