Comment: 
This block of code is a 2-to-1 multiplexer with 16-bit data inputs and output. Depending on the select line (s0), it selects between two 16-bit inputs i0 and i1. The selected input is then provided as the output (out). The internal register (tempout) is used to temporarily hold the selected input before it is output.
