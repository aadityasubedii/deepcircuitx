This block is a continuous assignment statement for an arithmetic addition operation. In it, every time there's a change in the values of 'In1' or 'In2', it calculates the sum of both inputs treating them as signed numbers. The result is assigned to the variable 'temp'. This logic is accomplished using the system function `$signed()`, which converts the verilog inputs 'In1' and 'In2' to signed numbers before performing the addition. The `always @` construct ensures this operation is performed continually anytime the inputs change.
