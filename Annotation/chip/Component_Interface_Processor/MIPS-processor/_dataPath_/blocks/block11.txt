Comment: 
This block performs conditional data assignment based on the eighth bit of the input data (dataIn[7]). When the eighth bit of dataIn is '1', the block fills the first 8 bits of 'tempA' with the corresponding bits from 'dataIn' and sets the remaining bits of 'tempA' to '1'. Otherwise, if the eighth bit of dataIn is '0', the block again fills the first 8 bits of 'tempA' with 'dataIn', but sets the other bits of 'tempA' to '0'. This function is achieved via iterative assignment within for-loops, which conditionally check and assign values based on the state of the input's eighth bit.
