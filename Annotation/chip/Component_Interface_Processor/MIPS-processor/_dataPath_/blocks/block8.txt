This block of code defines a 4-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer module in Verilog.[Function of the block]. The multiplexer selects an output signal from two input signals based on a single binary selection input.  [Implementation details of the block]. It takes two 4-bit inputs `i0` and `i1` and a selection input `s0` and produces a 4-bit output `out`. It contains internally a 4-bit register `tempout` to hold intermediate data during selection process.
