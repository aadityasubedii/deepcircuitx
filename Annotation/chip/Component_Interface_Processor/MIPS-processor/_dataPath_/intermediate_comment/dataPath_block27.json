    "block_comment": "This code represents a block for a register file in digital circuits. Its function is to store and retrieve data from multiple registers based on the addresses provided. The block takes in three 4-bit addresses (Aadd, Badd and Cadd), a 16-bit input data (Cin), and control signals for load, clear, and clock. It outputs 16-bit data from the addressed registers (Aout, Bout). Implementation relies on a 2D array 'registers' that stores data, and the specific data is selected based on the address provided in Aadd, Badd, and Cadd. The control signals 'load' and 'clear' help to perform write or clear operations."
