    "block_comment": "This block is designed for register operations in a synchronous system with load and clear functions. Upon the rising edge of the clock signal or when there's a clear signal, if the clear signal is low, it clears all the 16 registers by setting them to zero. It then assigns the values of the registers located at Aadd and Badd addresses to tempA and tempB respectively. If the 'load' signal is high, it loads the value of Cin into the register located at the Cadd address."
