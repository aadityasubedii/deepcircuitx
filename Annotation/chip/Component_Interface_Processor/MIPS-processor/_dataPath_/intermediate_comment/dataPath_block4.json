    "block_comment": "The block of code functions as a multiplexer, selecting between two input signals based on the value of a select signal. If the select signal 's0' is low (0), the output 'tempout' is equal to the value of the first input signal 'i0'. If the select signal 's0' is high (1), the output 'tempout' is set to the value of the second input signal 'i1'. This is implemented using an 'if-else' structure within an 'always' block, which executes every time there is a change in the values of 's0', 'i0', or 'i1'."
