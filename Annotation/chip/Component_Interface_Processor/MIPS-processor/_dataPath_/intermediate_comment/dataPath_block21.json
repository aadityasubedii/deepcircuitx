    "block_comment": "This block is an assignment operation block for signal propagation, ensuring correct mapping of signals from internal net names to external output names. The implementation is straightforward: each assign statement directly maps one internal output signal (on the right side of the equation) to an external interface signal (on the left side of the equation). This mapping ensures that the correct data is propagated out of the module or block."
