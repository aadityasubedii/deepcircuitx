    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a module called Data_Memory that handles read and write operations to an array of registers. The module takes in several inputs including a 16-bit data input, a 16-bit address, read and write control signals, and a clock signal and outputs a 16-bit data value. The registers are declared as an array of size 1024, each holding 16-bit data. During a write operation, data is written into the specified address. During a read operation, data is read from the specified address. The results of these operations are synchronously updated to the output based on the clock signal."
