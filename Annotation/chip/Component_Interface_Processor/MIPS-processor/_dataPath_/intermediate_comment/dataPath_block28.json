    "block_comment": "This block of code describes an 8-bit universal shift register. It takes in eight input bits `in[7:0]`, control bits `c0` and `c1`, clock `clk`, enable `enb`, shift left input `sli`, and shift right input `sri` to generate eight output bits `out[7:0]`. The block utilizes two 4-bit universal shift registers `shift1` and `shift2` to handle the input bits `in[7:0]`, dividing them into 2 groups of 4 bits. This module essentially serves as an interface, translating 8-bit operations into two concurrent 4-bit operations leveraging existing lower level modules."
