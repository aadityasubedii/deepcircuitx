    "block_comment": "The block of code is a part of a register file, which executes reading from a register or writing to a register operations based on control signals. The operation is triggered at the rising edge of a clock signal. If the 'regRead' signal is high, it reads from the 'dataInAdd' address of the 'registers' and assigns the value to 'Out' signal. Similarly, if the 'regWrite' signal is high, it writes 'dataIn' to the 'dataInAdd' address of the 'registers'."
