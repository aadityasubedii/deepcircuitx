    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to serve as a rising edge triggered 4-bit counter with synchronous reset capability. The counter is set to start counting from hexadecimal '5' once the synchronous reset trigger is detected (when `rst_n` is low) or at power on. It then counts up by one on every rising edge of the clock signal `clk`. In the implementation, the `rst_n` signal is actively examined at each positive edge of `clk`. If `rst_n` is low, `tempA` is set to 4'h5. Otherwise, the `tempA` will be incremented by one every clock cycle. Furthermore, the module output `dataOut` is always assigned the current value of `tempA`."
