    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code assigns the value of `tempA` to `instruction`. The `assign` statement represents a continuous assignment, implying a unidirectional data flow from `tempA` to `instruction`. This will automatically update `instruction` whenever `tempA` changes. Thus, the purpose of this block is to continually update `instruction` with whatever value is currently held in `tempA`."
