    "block_comment": "The given Verilog RTL code represents a module \"Instruction_Memory\" which acts as a mini in-system memory unit used to store and send instructions. The instructions are stored in a 16-bit width register array \"registers\", and the memory can be addressed with a 16-bit address given by \"instructionAdd\". The output  'instruction' returns the contents of the memory at the input address when the clock edge is detected. A temporary 16-bit register \"tempA\" is declared, but not used within this code snippet, implying it may be utilized later. An integer variable 'i' has also been initialized for potential iterative tasks. Owing to the lack of complete context, no detailed implementation is discernible from this snippet."
