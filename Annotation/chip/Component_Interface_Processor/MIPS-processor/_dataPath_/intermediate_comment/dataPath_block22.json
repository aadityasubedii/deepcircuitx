    "block_comment": "This block implements a state machine for an unspecified system, with the state defined by the 4 inputs (s0, s1, s2, s3) acting as a four-bit binary number. Depending on the current state (ranging from 0 'b0000 to 0 'b1001), this block sets the values of multiple output signals (out0 to out8, including out5A, out5B, and out5C). The description of each case is detailed, considering the specific value to be given to each output for the corresponding 4-bit input case."
