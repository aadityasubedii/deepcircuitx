    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns the value of `tempA` to the output `Aout`. The `assign` keyword is used, which indicates a continuous assignment statement. This means `Aout` is continuously driven by `tempA` and will update its value whenever `tempA` changes. This simple implementation allows `Aout` to reflect the real time value of `tempA` in the system."
