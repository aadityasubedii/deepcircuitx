Module-level comment: 

For stimulus: "This stimulus module generates test stimulus for a 2-to-1 multiplexer. It sets IN0 and IN1 with different values and toggles S0 to change selection. The state of multiplexer output is monitored in the OUTPUT signal."

For mux2_to_1: "This mux2_to_1 module simulates a binary 2-to-1 multiplexer. Depending on the select signal s0, either i0 or i1 is passed onto tempout in the always block. This state of tempout is constantly fed to the output, 'out', offering the results of the mux operation."
