Comment: 
This block of code assigns the value of 'tempout' signal to the output signal 'out'. Implemented using an 'assign' statement, a continuous assignment in Verilog, it describes a relationship that always exists between the left-hand side and the right-hand-side elements. The value of the 'tempout' signal is continually driven onto the 'out' signal.
