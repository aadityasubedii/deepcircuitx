This block of code functions as a 2:1 multiplexer, toggling between two input signals based on the selector. The implementation leverages an always block to continuously monitor changes on input lines. The selector line, `s0`, determines the output, `tempout`. If `s0` equals to binary 0, `tempout` stores the value from input line `i0`. Otherwise, `tempout` stores the value from `i1`.
