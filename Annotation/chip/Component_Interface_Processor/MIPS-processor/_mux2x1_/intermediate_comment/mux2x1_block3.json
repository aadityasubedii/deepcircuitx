    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code initializes IN0 and IN1 input signals and modifies signal S0 while displaying the changed values. Initially, IN0 is set to 1 and IN1 to 0. The current states of IN0 and IN1 are then printed. Afterwards, the S0 signal is set to 0 and its current state along with the OUTPUT is printed. After another time step, S0 is switched to 1 and its updated state with the OUTPUT is showcased."
