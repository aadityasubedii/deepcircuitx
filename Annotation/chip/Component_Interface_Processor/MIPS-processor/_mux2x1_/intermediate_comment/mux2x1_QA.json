Module names: The code contains two modules named \"stimulus\" and \"mux2_to_1\".\n\na) Module name: stimulus\n   Explanation: The stimulus module simulates inputs and controls the \"mux2_to_1\" module. Initially, it sets IN0 to 1 and IN1 to 0. The display function prints the values of IN0 and IN1. Then, it sets S0 to 0 and displays the value of S0 and OUTPUT. Next, it sets S0 to 1 and displays the value of S0 and OUTPUT.\n\nb) Module name: mux2_to_1\n   Explanation: The mux2_to_1 module acts as a 2-to-1 multiplexer. It takes three inputs: two data inputs (i0 and i1) and one select input (s0). If s0 is 0, it will pass the value of i0 to the output; otherwise, if s0 is 1, it will pass the value of i1 to the output. This module's functionality is shown in its always block that sets the value of tempout as either i0 or i1 based on the value of s0. The \"out\" is then assigned to be the tempout."

S0 is used to control the selection of the multiplexer, if S0 is '0', IN0 will be selected as an output and if '1', IN1 will be selected as output.\n   Output ports: OUTPUT. \n   Explanation: OUTPUT is the output signal obtained from our multiplexer operation.
