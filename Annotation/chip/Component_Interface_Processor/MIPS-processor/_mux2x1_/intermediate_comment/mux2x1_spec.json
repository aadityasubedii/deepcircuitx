    "spec": "Module name: stimulus. Module specification: The stimulus module is designed to simulate inputs and control the operation of the \"mux2_to_1\" module. It has two register inputs, IN0 and IN1, and one register control signal, S0. These signals simulate the inputs and selection operation of a multiplexer. The status of the multiplexer operation is captured by the wire output signal, OUTPUT. The module begins by setting IN0 to 1 and IN1 to 0, and then displays these values. Following this, it sets S0 to 0, thus controlling the selection of the multiplexer and displays the current state of S0 and OUTPUT. Then, it toggles S0 to 1 and again displays the state of S0 and OUTPUT. \n\nModule name: mux2_to_1. Module specification: The mux2_to_1 module models a binary 2-to-1 multiplexer operation. It takes three input signals - two data inputs (i0 and i1) and one select signal (s0). Depending on the state of s0, the multiplexer either passes the value of i0 or i1 to the output. The functionality of this operation is encapsulated in an always block, which sets the value of an internal register 'tempout' based on the value of s0. The output signal 'out' is continuously assigned the value of 'tempout', effectively providing the result of the multiplexer operation.",

Module names: The code contains two modules named \"stimulus\" and \"mux2_to_1\".\n\na) Module name: stimulus\n   Explanation: The stimulus module simulates inputs and controls the \"mux2_to_1\" module. Initially, it sets IN0 to 1 and IN1 to 0. The display function prints the values of IN0 and IN1. Then, it sets S0 to 0 and displays the value of S0 and OUTPUT.

If s0 is 0, it will pass the value of i0 to the output; otherwise, if s0 is 1, it will pass the value of i1 to the output.

S0 is used to control the selection of the multiplexer, if S0 is '0', IN0 will be selected as an output and if '1', IN1 will be selected as output.\n   Output ports: OUTPUT. \n   Explanation: OUTPUT is the output signal obtained from our multiplexer operation.
