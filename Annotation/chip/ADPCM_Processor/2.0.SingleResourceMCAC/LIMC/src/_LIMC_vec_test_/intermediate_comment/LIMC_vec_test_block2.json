    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a clock signal in a testbench or simulation environment. The clock signal, 'clk', is inverted every half a clock period, defined by the macro 'CLK_PERIOD', to simulate the rising and falling edges of a clock in a digital system. The 'always' keyword makes the process repeat indefinitely. The use of the bitwise NOT operator (~) aids in creating the alternating high and low states needed for a clock signal."
