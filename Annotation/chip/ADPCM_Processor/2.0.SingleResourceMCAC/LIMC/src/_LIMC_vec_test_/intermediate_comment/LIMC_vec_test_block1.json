    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is essentially a testbench for an ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation) model. It checks for the correctness of the ADPCM' algorithm's response. The implementation details involve nested loops to traverse different model conditions, operation types, laws, and rates. For each combination, vector sizes, 'A2T', and 'A2P' values are read from memory map files, and these are compared in a clock-cycled loop against the expected 'A2P' values. If a discrepancy is found, an error is displayed, and if an ERRORSTOP preprocessor directive is enabled, the simulation is stopped. The testing continues until all combination of the parameters have been checked. At the end of fully traversing the parameter space, the testbench signals the completion of the test."
