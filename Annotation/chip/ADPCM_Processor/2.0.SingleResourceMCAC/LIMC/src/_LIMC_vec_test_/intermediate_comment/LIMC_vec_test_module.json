    "module": "Module-level comment: The Test module functions as a comprehensive testbench for the LIMC module. It tests various configurations, models, rates, operations, and laws by loading test vectors from external files, then compares these to the LIMC output. This module leverages several internal signals and arrays to iterate over different settings, controlling the testing process based on either verbose mode or sdv annotations. Key blocks include initial setup, clock signal generation, and nested loops for systematic testing. This module prints a \"TEST COMPLETE\" message upon successful execution, ending the simulation."
