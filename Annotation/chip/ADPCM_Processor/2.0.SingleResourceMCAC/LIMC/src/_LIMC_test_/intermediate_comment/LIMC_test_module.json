    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module initialises test-related variables for the LIMC module. It defines input registers for scan testing (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), a `reset` signal, a `clk` signal, as well as `scan_enable` and `test_mode` signals. It also connects to five output wires, `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, of the LIMC module for reading outputs. If `SDFSCAN` is defined, it employs an SDF file for timing delay information. All signals are initially set to zero during the `initial` block to ensure a consistent start state for testing."
