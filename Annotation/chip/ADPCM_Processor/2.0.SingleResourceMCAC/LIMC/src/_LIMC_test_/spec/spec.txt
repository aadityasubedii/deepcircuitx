Module name: Test
Module specification: The test module is designed to initialize a range of variables for the LIMC module for testing purposes. The main operation of this module is to declare several wires that are internally connected to the LIMC module for monitoring its output, and to define several register variables to be used as scan inputs: `scan_in0`, `scan_in1`, `scan_in2`, `scan_in3`, `scan_in4`, a reset signal `reset`, a clock signal `clk`, a test mode flag `test_mode`, and a scan enable flag `scan_enable`. The initialization of these variables is done during `initial` block where all above mentioned registers are set to zero. This module also defines five wire connections for scan outputs: `scan_out0`, `scan_out1`, `scan_out2`, `scan_out3`, `scan_out4` from the LIMC module. For timing analysis during testing, if SDFSCAN is defined, it annotates the top module with a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file. The `clk` and `reset` are internal signals, and they are used to sequence the internal logic and initialize internal states, respectively. Signals `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode` are internally used for scan testing, controlling when the inputs are valid and when the LIMC module is running in test mode. The module concludes by signaling the completion of the simulation with `$finish`. Overall, it prepares the environment for the testing procedures of the LIMC module, offering controls and monitoring ability for the test.
