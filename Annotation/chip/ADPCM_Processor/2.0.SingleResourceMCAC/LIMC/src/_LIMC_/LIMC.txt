Module-level comment: The LIMC module acts as a Limit Checker, limiting input value 'A2T' within specified boundaries. It uses internal signals 'A2UL' and 'A2LL' to set limit values and adjusts output value 'A2P' according to these limits. If 'A2T' falls within the range of 'A2UL' and 'A2LL', it is adjusted to the relevant limit value; otherwise, it retains the same value. It also integrates inputs for reset, clock, scan, test mode, and outputs for scan results.
