It has a set of inputs and outputs, including reset and clock signals, scan inputs and outputs, a test mode, and scan enable. Based on the defined upper limit (A2UL = 0x3000) and lower limit (A2LL = 0xD000), it processes the input (A2T) and determines the output (A2P). If the A2T is inside the lower limit and 0x8000, it assigns the lower limit value to A2P. If A2T is within A2UL and 0x7FFF, it assigns the upper limit value to A2P. In all other scenarios, A2P is fed directly from A2T. This module, therefore, checks the limits for the given input and restricts it within defined values."
