Module name: LIMC.

Module specification: The LIMC module is a Limit Checker circuit developed in Verilog RTL code. Its primary functionality is to restrict the output value within the set limits (upper and lower) based on the original input value. The module incorporates several input ports, including a reset signal for system resetting, a clk signal for timing and synchronization, scan_in(0-4) and scan_enable for testing and debugging, and test_mode for indicating the system status. The A2T is a 16-bit input port that holds the original value to be checked and limited. On the output side, scan_out(0-4) are used for testing purposes, whilst A2P is a 16-bit output that delivers the value post limit checking. Internally, the module utilizes two signals: A2UL (Upper Limit) and A2LL (Lower Limit), responsible for setting the boundaries for input values. The code can be divided into sections: initial definitions of inputs and outputs, followed by the instantiation of the internal signals A2UL and A2LL, and finally, the conditional checking of input value (A2T) and assignment to the output (A2P).
