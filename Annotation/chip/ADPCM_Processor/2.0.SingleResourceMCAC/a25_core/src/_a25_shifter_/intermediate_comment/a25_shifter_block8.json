    "block_comment": "This block of code is a generate statement that assigns a logical shift right (LSR) value based on the \"FULL_BARREL\" setting. If \"FULL_BARREL\" is set to '1', the code executes a full barrel shift, which allows for a complete arbitrary bit shift of the \"i_in\" value based on \"i_shift_amount\". It also considers edge cases, such as when \"i_shift_imm_zero\" is true, where it assigns a zero value. However, when \"FULL_BARREL\" is not '1', it runs a quicker LSR operation reducing the shift capacity to only a 4-bit shift. The shift amount, in this case, is determined by the 2 least significant bits of \"i_shift_amount\". The \"i_carry_in\" bit is incorporated to allow for carry-over during the shift operation."
