    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_shifter module performs configurable bit shifts (LSL, LSR, ASR, ROR) for a given input, shift amount, carry-in and immediate zero indicated by the inputs 'i_in', 'i_shift_amount', 'i_carry_in', and 'i_shift_imm_zero' respectively. The operation is chosen by 'i_function'. Based on 'FULL_BARREL', the module executes full or quick versions of shifts. Four internal 33-bit signals (lsl_out, lsr_out, asr_out, ror_out) temporarily store each operation's result, which are then selected to output based on 'i_function'. Carry-out is propagated via 'o_carry_out'."
