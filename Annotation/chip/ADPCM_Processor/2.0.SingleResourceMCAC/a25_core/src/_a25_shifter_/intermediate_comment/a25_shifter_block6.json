    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block is responsible for performing an arithmetic shift right (ASR). It leverages conditional (ternary) operations to implement the shift operations. If the 'FULL_BARREL' flag is set to 1, the shifting process is initiated. The shifting operation is determined by the value of 'i_shift_amount', which can range from 0 to 31. For example, if 'i_shift_amount' is equal to 1, the input is shifted to the right by one bit, and the most significant bit (i_in[31]) is replicated and appended on the left. Essentially, this operation retains the sign of the number during the shift, making it an arithmetic shift. The 'i_shift_imm_zero' condition checks if the shift amount is zero, and in such case, the input is copied to the output with the carry_in added at the MSB. If none of the conditions are met, the last line of code replicates the MSB 32 times, effectively turning the entire data to all zeros or all ones, depending on the MSB.\n"
