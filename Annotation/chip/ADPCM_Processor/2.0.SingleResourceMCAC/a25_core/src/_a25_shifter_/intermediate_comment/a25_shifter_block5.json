    "block_comment": "This block of code performs arithmetic shift right (ASR) operation on a 32-bit binary number. Based on different conditions, the ASR operation varies according to the shift amount. If immediate shift value is zero, the block outputs the number's sign bit (31st bit) repeated 32 times. If the shift amount is from 1 to 31, the block shifts the input right by that amount, replicates the sign bit for the newly emptied positions, and imposes the values of carry-in bit or the sign bit at the beginning of the 32-bit output. If none of these conditions are met, the block outputs the 32 repetitions of the input sign bit."
