    "block_comment": "This block is an Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR) module. It right shifts the 32-bit input (i_in) based on the given shift amount (i_shift_amount), extending the sign bit (i_in[31]) to prevent loss of the negative value. If the shift amount is 0, the input is shifted by the carry input (i_carry_in). It handles corner cases such as zero input and varying shift amounts, providing flexibility for arithmetic operations."
