    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block assigns output values based on a given input operation function. The operands `o_carry_out` and `o_out` take their values from one out of four possible outputs: `lsl_out`, `lsr_out`, `asr_out`, or `ror_out`. This selection is dependent on the matching function indicated by `i_function`. Boolean operations are used to compare `i_function` with predefined constants for left shift (`LSL`), logical right shift (`LSR`), arithmetic right shift (`ASR`), and rotate right (`ROR`). The output for the corresponding operation is selected as a result."
