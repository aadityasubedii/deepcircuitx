Comment: 
The block of code performs an arithmetic shift right (ASR) operation on a 32-bit input. Depending on the value of 'i_shift_amount', the block shifts the bits of 'i_in' to the right, replicates the sign bit to the leftmost bits, and concatentates 'i_carry_in' or the original bits of 'i_in' to the resulting bit-vector. If 'i_shift_imm_zero' is true, the output, 'asr_out', is the sign bit of 'i_in' replicated 32 times. If 'i_shift_amount' is 0, 1, 2, or any other value, 'asr_out' is obtained by performing none, 1-bit, 2-bit or 3-bit arithmetic shift right on 'i_in' respectively.
