This block of code is designed for arithmetic right shifting (ASR). If the signal FULL_BARREL equals 1, the 'full_asr' mode gets executed. Here, the ASR output is mainly influenced by the 'i_shift_amount'. Based on the value of 'i_shift_amount', a number of bits, equal to that value, will be moved to the right. If 'i_shift_imm_zero' signal is active, the output is filled with the 31st bit replicated 32 times. However, if FULL_BARREL is not 1, then 'quick_asr' mode executes the same task but less specifically; it checks only the least significant two bits of 'i_shift_amount' and executes the corresponding shifting. If 'i_shift_amount' doesn't match any case, the code defaults to shifting three places to the right.
