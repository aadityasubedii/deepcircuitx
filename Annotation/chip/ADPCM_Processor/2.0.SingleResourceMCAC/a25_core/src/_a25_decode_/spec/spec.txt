Module name: a25_decode. Module specification: This module implements the instruction decode stage of an ARM processor (likely an ARM v2a). It takes fetched instructions and various control signals as inputs, decodes the instructions, and generates control signals for subsequent pipeline stages. The module handles different instruction types (e.g., register operations, memory transfers, branches), manages pipeline stalls, deals with interrupts, and generates appropriate signals for ALU operations, register file access, and memory operations. It also includes logic for handling various processor modes and status flags. Input ports include clock, reset, scan enable, test mode, fetched instruction, core stall, interrupt requests, abort signals, execution addresses, and status bits. Output ports provide decoded instruction information, control signals for various operations (ALU, barrel shifter, multiplication), register selection signals, memory access controls, status bit controls, coprocessor-related signals, abort signals, and conflict detection signals.
