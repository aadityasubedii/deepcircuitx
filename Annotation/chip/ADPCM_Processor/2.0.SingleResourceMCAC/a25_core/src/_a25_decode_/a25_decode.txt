Module-level comment: This module implements the instruction decode stage for an ARM processor. It decodes fetched instructions, generates control signals for subsequent pipeline stages, and handles various instruction types, interrupts, and exceptions. The module uses a state machine to manage different execution phases, implements conditional execution logic, and generates appropriate signals for ALU operations, register file access, and memory operations. It also includes logic for handling different processor modes, status flags, and coprocessor operations.
