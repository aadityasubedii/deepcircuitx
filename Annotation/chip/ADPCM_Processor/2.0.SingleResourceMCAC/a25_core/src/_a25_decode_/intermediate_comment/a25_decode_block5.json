    "block_comment": "The given block of code assigns the value of the new `dabt` (Data Abort) signal. It achieves this by performing a logical OR operation on two input signals - `dabt_reg` (Data Abort Register) and `i_dabt` (Input Data Abort). The output `dabt` thus becomes high (or true) if either or both of the input signals are high (or true)."
