    "block_comment": "The block of code describes a priority encoder for different types of interrupts in a system. It uses conditional operators to evaluate each requested interrupt in terms of priority, assigning a specific 3-bit value to `next_interrupt`, depending on which interrupt request is active. DABT, FIRQ, IRQ, Instruction ADEX, Instruction IABT, UND, and SWI interrupts are checked in descending order of priority. If no request is active, the `next_interrupt` is assigned a default value of 3'd0."
