    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to generate a signal called 'interrupt_or_conflict' based on certain conditions for a signal named 'next_interrupt'. It checks if the value of 'next_interrupt' is not equal to decimal values 0, 7, and 6. If these conditions are all true, the 'interrupt_or_conflict' is assigned a Boolean true value."
