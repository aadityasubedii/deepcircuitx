    "block_comment": "This block generates an interrupt signal, activated when certain conditions are met. With the use of the \"assign\" keyword, the block assigns the \"interrupt\" variable with the result of the boolean conditions evaluated. Specifically, it checks if the 'next_interrupt' value is not equal to zero, seven and six, and that there isn't a conflict, represented by the 'conflict' variable."
