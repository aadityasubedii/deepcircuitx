    "block_comment": "This block of code checks if there is an undefined request based on the type of instruction being processed. The `und_request` is triggered if the instruction type is either `CODTRANS` or `COREGOP`. Alternatively, it's also activated if the instruction type is `CORTRANS` and the instruction subset `instruction[11:8] does not equal to `4'd15`. The code uses Verilog's bitwise logical OR (`||`) and bitwise logical AND (`&&`) operators to establish these conditions. This assignment statement is synthesized to combinational logic during hardware synthesis."
