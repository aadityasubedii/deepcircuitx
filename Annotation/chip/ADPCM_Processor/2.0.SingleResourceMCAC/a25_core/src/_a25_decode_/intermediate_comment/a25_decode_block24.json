    "block_comment": "The line of code defines a mask for the `mtrans_reg2` by performing a bit-shift operation. This operation shifts '1' to the left by the number of places specified by `mtrans_reg1`. The result of this computation is then assigned to `mtrans_reg2_mask`. This provides a mechanism for manipulating or controlling specific bits of the `mtrans_reg2` variable."
