    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for encoding the instruction type based on the value of `instruction[15:0]`. It achieves this by using a combinational always block with case statement that evaluates the instruction to determine the specific 'mtrans_reg1' value. Each case line decodes the 16-bit instruction vector, where each position represents a unique binary instruction. Following the binary weight, the instruction is assigned to a 4-bit hex number. In case no instruction matches, the `default` clause assigns 'mtrans_reg1' to 4'hf as a fail-safe."
