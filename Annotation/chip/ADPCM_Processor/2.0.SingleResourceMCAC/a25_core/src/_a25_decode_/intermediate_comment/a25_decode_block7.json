    "block_comment": "The given block of code is responsible for saving state of instructions in a digital circuit. Upon a positive edge of reset or clock, it checks if a 'reset' is triggered. If true, it initializes all saved and prefetched instruction related variables to default (0). If not reset and there's no stall from the core, it proceeds with updating these variables based on the type of instruction (MTRANS or saved_current_instruction) from input or prefetched fetch_instruction. Additionally, it holds the instruction's information that includes type and status until the next cycle."
