    "block_comment": "The block is a synchronous circuit that monitors the execution of instructions and catches invalid instructions. It gets activated upon positive edge of reset signal or system clock (clk). If reset is active, it doesn't perform any action. However, in the other case, it checks whether the control state is in execution state. If so, it further checks for undefined statuses (represented as 'x') at the either ends of an instruction. If such invalid instructions are encountered, it raises an error message with the instruction details."
