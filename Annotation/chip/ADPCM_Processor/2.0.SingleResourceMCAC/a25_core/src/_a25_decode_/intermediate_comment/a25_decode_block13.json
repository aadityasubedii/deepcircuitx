    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code block is a complex sequential logic block that processes a wide range of instructions for a custom CPU. The implementation details involve initialising various status bits, register banks, ALU selectors, and other control signals based on the currently processed instruction. Conditional processing handles different types of instructions, including register operations, memory operations, branching, multiple operations, swap functions, and coprocessor transactions. For example, if the type equals BRANCH, the block manipulates the program counter and may update certain registers. Other operations include shifts, increments, bitwise operations, and even conditional updates based on whether an instruction is valid, an interrupt is present, and no conflict arises."
