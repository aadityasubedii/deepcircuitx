    "block_comment": "This block generates a multi-bit value (named mtrans_num_registers) from specific bits of another multi-bit variable (named instruction). It extracts individual bits of 'instruction' from bit 15 to bit 0 through bitwise indexing and combines them with zero-padded values to generate an integral output. This approach provides detailed control over the manipulation and transformation of multi-bit signal data."
