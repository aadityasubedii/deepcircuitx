    "block_comment": "The block of verilog code is responsible for direction and type assignment depending on the value of `type`. The `xMODE` is assigned by invoking the function `mode_name` using the `status_bits_mode_r` as an argument. On the other hand, the variable `xTYPE` is assigned a specific string value based on the value of `type`. This is accomplished using a cascading ternary operation, comparing `type` to predefined conditions namely `REGOP`, `MULT`, `SWAP`, `TRANS`, `MTRANS`, `BRANCH`, `CODTRANS`, `COREGOP`, `CORTRANS`, and `SWI`. If none of the conditions are met, `xTYPE` is assigned the string \"UNKNOWN\"."
