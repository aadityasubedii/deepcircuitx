    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code assigns a value to a system signal called mtrans_base_reg_change. The main function of this block is creating a concatenated 32-bit value with the first 25 bits set to '0', following with the value of mtrans_num_registers, and then appended by two more '0' bits. This can be used to shift the mtrans_num_registers' value 2 places to the left when using binary data fields."
