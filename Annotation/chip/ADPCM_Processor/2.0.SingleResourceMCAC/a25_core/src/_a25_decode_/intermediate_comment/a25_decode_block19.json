    "block_comment": "The purpose of this Verilog code block is to assign specific interrupt request signals based on different conditions. The conditions are defined by a combination of input signals and status bits. Specifically, `firq_request` is set when a fast interrupt request (`firq`) is active and instruction execution is not disabled, indicated by the 26th status bit. On the other hand, `irq_request` is set when an interrupt request (`irq`) is active whilst the processor is not in an exception, pointed by the 27th status bit. SWI (Software Interrupt) condition, indicated by `swi_request`, activates when the type becomes equivalent to SWI. Finally, `dabt_request` corresponds to the current state of the Data Abort register (`dabt_reg`). The implementation utilizes Verilog's `assign` statement to evaluate the conditions right-to-left and updates the left-side variable as per changes in any of the right-side components."
