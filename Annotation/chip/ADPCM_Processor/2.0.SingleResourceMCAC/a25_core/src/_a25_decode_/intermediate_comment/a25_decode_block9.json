    "block_comment": "This is a state machine controller block in Verilog that navigates through different states of a system operation. Various input parameters guide the transition between states, mainly based on the condition checks on 'control_state' for determining the 'control_state_nxt'. If 'control_state' matches the provided states, such as 'RST_WAIT1', 'RST_WAIT2', 'INT_WAIT1', 'INT_WAIT2', etc., 'control_state_nxt' is assigned the next corresponding state. More complex conditions such as those with 'MTRANS_EXEC1' and 'MTRANS_EXEC2' involve additional checks like 'mtrans_instruction_nxt' and 'mtrans_num_registers' for state transition guidance. The final segment of the code adjusts the 'control_state_nxt' based on 'instruction_valid' and related conditions to manage concurrent process execution and data conflicts."
