    "block_comment": "The line of code assigns the value of the boolean variable 'conflict' to the output 'o_conflict'. This is a continuous assignment statement in Verilog, which means the value of 'o_conflict' updates immediately whenever the value of 'conflict' changes. This assignment is used to output the conflict signal from this block of the design."
