    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block decodes the least significant '1' bit location in a 16-bit wide 'instruction' signal, masked by 'mtrans_reg2_mask', and stores the bit location value in the 'mtrans_reg2' register. It utilizes an always block with a casez statement, which compares the masked 'instruction' value against possible patterns with a '1' value bit in all 16 locations. The 'mtrans_reg2' is cleared ('4h0') if the least significant bit is at location 1, set to '4h1' for location 2, and so on, through to '4he' for the most significant bit at location 15. If no '1' bit is found, 'mtrans_reg2' is set to '4hf' in the default case.\n"
