Comment: 
This block of code assigns an interrupt mode based on the value of `next_interrupt`. It uses conditional (ternary) operator (`?:`) in Verilog to check if `next_interrupt` is equal to specific decimal numbers 2-7 and 1, and assigns the corresponding value ('FIRQ', 'IRQ', 'SVC', or 'USR') to `interrupt_mode`. If `next_interrupt` is not equal to any of the specified decimal numbers, 'USR' is assigned to `interrupt_mode` by default. This code provides a mechanism for managing system interrupts.
