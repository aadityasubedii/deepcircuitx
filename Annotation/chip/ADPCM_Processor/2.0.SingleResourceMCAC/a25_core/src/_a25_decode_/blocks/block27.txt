Comment: 
The block is a register update module for a processing core. The module leverages sequential logic to hold and update its state on every positive edge of the clock or whenever a reset signal is asserted. On the assertion of the reset signal, all the registers in this block are turned off. However, in the absence of the reset signal, but presence of the clock signal, the running state of every register is updated with their respective inputs. Particularly, the conflict series of registers are used to monitor conflicts in the processing core. The o_rn_use_read, o_rm_use_read, o_rs_use_read and o_rd_use_read registers are specially designed to validate instructions and check for potential conflicts.
