The block defines the state translation for a control unit in a digital system. This control unit could be potentially part of a CPU or a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). It maps `control_state`, an enumerated type, to its corresponding string representation. The implementation utilizes Verilog's conditional (ternary) operator, which checks the value of `control_state` and returns the equivalent state string. It covers various states from reset states (`RST_WAIT1`, `RST_WAIT2`), interrupt states (`INT_WAIT1`, `INT_WAIT2`), fetch state (`PRE_FETCH_EXEC`), to perform multiple processes (`MULT_PROC1`, `MULT_PROC2`, etc.) and manage memory transactions (`MTRANS_EXEC1`, `MTRANS_EXEC2`). A default of "UNKNOWN " is returned when `control_state` does not match any predefined option.
