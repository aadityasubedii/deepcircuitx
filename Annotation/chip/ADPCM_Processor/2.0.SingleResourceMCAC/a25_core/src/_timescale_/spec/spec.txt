Regrettably, the provided Verilog code is not sufficient to answer the question as it only includes a `timescale directive, which specifies the time unit and precision for the associated logic simulation. It doesn't define a module, its functionality, input/output ports, or internal signals.

In order to generate a detailed module specification, we need a Verilog module that includes definitions of the module, its functionality, the input/output ports, internal signals, and the code blocks or different sections of the code. The information provided is not adequate to give any specifications related to a Verilog module.

To illustrate, a hypothetical module specification can be summarized as follows:
Module name: Adder. Module specification: The Adder is a combinational circuit that performs addition of two numbers. It has two input ports 'A' and 'B' which take the binary numbers for addition and an output port, 'Sum' that provides the addition of binary numbers. Internal signals like 'carry' are used to store and carry over any overflow from the addition of binary digits. The code primarily consists of logic operations to perform binary addition, assignment of the output and control for carryover in case of certain conditions.
