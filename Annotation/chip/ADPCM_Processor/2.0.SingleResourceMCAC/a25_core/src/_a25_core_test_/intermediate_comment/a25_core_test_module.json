    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module is a setup for the simulation of 'a25_core'. It sets up scan inputs ('scan_in0' to 'scan_in4'), 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' for the core, and captures the results at scan outputs ('scan_out0' to 'scan_out4'). It includes an initial block which sets the time format and conditions for simulation inputs. Implementation relies on the internal signals for operation, though 'clk_count' and 'testfail' aren't used in the given code. Note this module only initiates the process, the 'a25_core' tests are not defined here."
