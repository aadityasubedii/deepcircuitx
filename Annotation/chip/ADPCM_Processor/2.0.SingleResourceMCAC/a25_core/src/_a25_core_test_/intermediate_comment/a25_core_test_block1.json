    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is essentially an initialization block for a testbench. It sets up time formatting, annotates SDF if required, and initializes several variables to 0. The `$timeformat` function sets the display of simulation time in a specific format. The `ifdef SDFSCAN` directive conditionally executes SDF annotation applicable during scan-testing for the device-under-test (DUT) 'test.top'. There are several bit variables, representing clock, reset, scan inputs, scan enable and test mode. Eventually, it concludes with a `$finish` command to end the simulation."
