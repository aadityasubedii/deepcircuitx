    "block_comment": "This block is used to update the privileged status of a hardware component. It is implemented via an 'assign' statement in Verilog, which assigns a new value to the variable 'privileged_update'. The new value is the logical NOT of the value stored in 'i_core_stall'. In effect, if 'i_core_stall' is true (indicating the core is stalling), then 'privileged_update' is false, indicating that the component is not in a privileged state. Conversely, if the core is not stalling, then the component is in a privileged state."
