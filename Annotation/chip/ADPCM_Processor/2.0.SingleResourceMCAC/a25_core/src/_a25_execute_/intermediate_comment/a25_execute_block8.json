    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the value of `iaddress_r` (input address register) to the output `o_iaddress`. This implementation simply takes the current value stored in the `iaddress_r`, and places its value on the `o_iaddress` line, effectively behaving as a wire that connects `iaddress_r` to `o_iaddress`."
