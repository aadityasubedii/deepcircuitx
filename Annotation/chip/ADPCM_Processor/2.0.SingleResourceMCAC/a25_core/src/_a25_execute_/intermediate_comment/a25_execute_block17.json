    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating an address value within the system (iaddress_update). The update process is done via the utilization of a logical OR operation. The address updating mechanism is triggered if the write enable signal of the program counter to the data memory (pc_dmem_wen) is active, or when there is no stall signal from the core of the system (i_core_stall) as well as no conflict signal (i_conflict). Hence, if either of these two conditions is true, iaddress_update is updated."
