    "block_comment": "This block is an instantiation of the a25_register_bank module which manages processor register access and operations. It's wired to various control and data signals. Clock and reset signals are provided to maintain synchronization and to ensure a defined initial state. It receives inputs such as stall signals, register selectors, write enable signals, program counter value and mode information from the decoding and execution stages of the processor. Incoming write-back data and its validity information is provided for writing result back to the proper register. Various status flags and mode information are passed to the module for handling different operational conditions. The output of the module carries the data of selected register operands and the program counter."
