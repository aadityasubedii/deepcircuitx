Then, depending on these inputs, it performs a number of operations such as ALU operations, barrel shifting, multiplication, and determining the addresses for instruction fetch and data access. \n\nThe module also manages the program counter, instruction and data address, and several CPU statuses. Its outputs include data that needs to be written back to registers or memory, flags from ALU/multiply operation, the actual instruction and data addresses and signals that show if any particular part of the processor state is to be updated.\n\nThis module also includes instances of `a25_barrel_shift`, `a25_alu`, `a25_multiply`, and `a25_register_bank` entities meaning it uses a barrel shifter, an ALU, a multiplier, and a register bank to perform various operations."
