    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is responsible for updating the address `daddress_update` whenever there is no stall condition in the core (`!i_core_stall`). The updating of the address value is controlled by the negated core stall condition. If the core is not in a stall state, the digital address `daddress_update` gets updated, else it remains the same. This is realized using an assign statement, which simplifies conditional continuous assignment in Verilog."
