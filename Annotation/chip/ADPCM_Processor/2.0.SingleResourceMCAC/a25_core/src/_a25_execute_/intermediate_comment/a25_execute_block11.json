    "block_comment": "This code block is used to update the status bits for interrupt requests mask in a system. The 'status_bits_irq_mask_update' is assigned a value depending on the processing status of the core and load module. If the load module is active ('ldm_status_bits' is TRUE) or if the core is not stalled ('i_core_stall' is FALSE) and currently executing instructions ('execute' is TRUE), and an interrupt request mask write-enable signal ('i_status_bits_irq_mask_wen') is active, THEN 'status_bits_irq_mask_update' is updated. This signifies an event that needs to be recognized by the processor to update the interrupt mask. This block combines system status signals to determine the conditions for status bit update."
