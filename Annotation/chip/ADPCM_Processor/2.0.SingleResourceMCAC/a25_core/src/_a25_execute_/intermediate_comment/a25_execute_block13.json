    "block_comment": "This block assigns a new state to the `status_bits_mode_update` signal. The new state is determined by a logic gate operation. This operation involves an OR gate, which takes as inputs the `ldm_status_bits` signal and the result of an AND gate. The AND gate takes as inputs the NOT operation of `i_core_stall`, the `execute` signal, and the `i_status_bits_mode_wen` signal. If the `ldm_status_bits` is 1, or if the `i_core_stall` is not active and both `execute` and `i_status_bits_mode_wen` signals are active, the `status_bits_mode_update` will be updated to 1."
