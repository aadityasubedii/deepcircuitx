    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to control the value of 'carry_in' depending on the value of 'i_use_carry_in'. If 'i_use_carry_in' is true (high), 'carry_in' will be assigned the value of the second status bit flag. Otherwise, it will be set to zero. This is implemented using a conditional operator (? :) in Verilog, often called a ternary operator, which works like an if-else statement."
