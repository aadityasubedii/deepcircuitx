    "module": "Module-level comment: This module executes instructions in a CPU pipeline, performing ALU operations, barrel shifts, multiplication, and address calculations. It processes control signals, register selections, and immediates to update processor state. The module integrates ALU, barrel shifter, multiplier, and register bank components, managing status bits, program counter, and memory interactions. It handles instruction/data addressing, privilege levels, and conditional execution, outputting results for register/memory writeback and updating processor status."
