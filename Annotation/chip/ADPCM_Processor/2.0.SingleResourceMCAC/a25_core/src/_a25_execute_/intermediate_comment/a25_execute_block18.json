    "block_comment": "This block assigns a new value to the byte_enable_update signal. Given the combination of conditions in the assign statement, the byte_enable_update is updated when the i_core_stall signal is not asserted and both the execute signal and the i_write_data_wen signal are asserted. In this way, the byte_enable_update gets updated to reflect the state of the system in terms of whether it is in a state where it is able to execute and write data."
