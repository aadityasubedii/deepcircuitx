    "block_comment": "This block of code generates an exclusive signal, named 'exclusive_update', for the condition when the core is not in a stalled state and is in an execution cycle. It uses a logical negation (`!`) operator on the 'i_core_stall' signal and a logical AND (`&&`) operator with the 'execute' state."
