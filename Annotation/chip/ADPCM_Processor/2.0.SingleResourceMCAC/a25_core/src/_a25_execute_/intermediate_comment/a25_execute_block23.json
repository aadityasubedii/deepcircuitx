    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to update the execution status of read register and load in a pipeline based processor or similar structure in Verilog. It updates exec_load_rd_update if there's a valid instruction executing and there's no stall in place. It does so by implementing a logical AND gate (!i_core_stall && execute) that results in a signal if execution is ongoing and there's no stall in the core."
