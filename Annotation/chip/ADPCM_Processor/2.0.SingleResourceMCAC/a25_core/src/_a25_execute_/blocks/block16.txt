Comment: 
This block is assigning value to the copro_write_data_update signal. The value is determined by checking three conditions: whether there is no stall in the i_core, whether the action is execution and if the i_copro_write_data_wen is enabled. The logical AND operation is performed between these conditions leading to a single Boolean output. The signal is updated only if all the conditions are true, ensuring the write data update process proceeds without a stall in the core, during execution, and only with the write enable signal active.
