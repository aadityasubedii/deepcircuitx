Comment: 
This block assigns a value to `barrel_shift_carry_alu` based on conditionals. It checks whether `i_barrel_shift_data_sel` equals to 2'b00, if true, a nested conditional is entered where it's checked whether the bits 4 to 1 of `i_imm_shift_amount` equals to 0. If this condition holds, `status_bits_flags[1] is assigned, otherwise bit 31 of `i_imm32` is assigned. If the first conditional doesn't hold, `barrel_shift_carry` is directly assigned to `barrel_shift_carry_alu`.
