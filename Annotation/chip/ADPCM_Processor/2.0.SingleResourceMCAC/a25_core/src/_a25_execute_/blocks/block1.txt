The block is responsible for encoding the status mode of a system into a human-readable format. Depending on the value of `status_bits_mode`, it assigns a string representation to `xMODE`. If `status_bits_mode` equals `SVC`, `xMODE` becomes `"SVC"`. Similar assignments happen for `IRQ`, `FIRQ`, and `USR` values. If `status_bits_mode` doesn't match any of the aforementioned, `xMODE` is assigned `"XXX"` as a default case.
