Comment: 
This block manages the resetting and updating of read data and load read information. On a positive edge of reset or clock signal, if a reset is detected, the `read_data_filtered_r` and `load_rd_r` are cleared to zero. If the reset is not triggered, but a `i_wb_read_data_valid` is detected (indicating valid read data is available), `read_data_filtered_r` is updated with the filtered read data and `load_rd_r` is updated with specific bits of `i_wb_load_rd`. This block essentially ensures data integrity by controlling the flow into the read data register and load read register.
