Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for updating the 'status_bits_mode_rds_oh_update' signal based on the negation of 'i_core_stall' signal. In essence, 'status_bits_mode_rds_oh_update' will be high (1) when 'i_core_stall' is not asserted (0), meaning the core is not in a stall condition, and vice versa. This implementation achieves its functionality using the assign statement in Verilog, which allows for continuous assignments or propagation of changes.
