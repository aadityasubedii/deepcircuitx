Comment: 
This block represents the instance of a 32-bit multiplier device (a25_multiply). The multiplier takes two 32-bit number inputs (i_a_in, i_b_in) and the type of operation to be performed (i_function). After the execute signal (i_execute) is high, it performs the multiplication or operation designated in i_function and sends the output to o_out and o_flags. The multiplication operation is carried out synchronously with the clock input (clk). Reset (reset), scan_enable, test_mode, and i_core_stall are control signals for the block. The operation completion is indicated by the o_done signal.
