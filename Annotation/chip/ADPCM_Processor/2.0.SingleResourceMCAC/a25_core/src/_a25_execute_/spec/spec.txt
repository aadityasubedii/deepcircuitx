Module name: a25_execute. Module specification: The a25_execute module is a critical component of a CPU architecture, responsible for executing instructions decoded in previous pipeline stages. It processes various input signals including control signals, register selections, immediates, ALU and shift function selectors, and signals for updating processor state. The module performs operations such as ALU computations, barrel shifting, multiplication, and address determination for instruction fetch and data access. Key inputs include clock, reset, stall signals, data from writeback stage, and various control and selection signals. Outputs encompass data for register/memory writeback, instruction/data addresses, and processor status information. Internally, the module utilizes signals for managing write data, byte enables, program counter operations, ALU outputs, register values, and status bits. The code is structured into sections for status bit management, address calculations, barrel shifting, ALU operations, multiplication, and register bank interactions. It incorporates
