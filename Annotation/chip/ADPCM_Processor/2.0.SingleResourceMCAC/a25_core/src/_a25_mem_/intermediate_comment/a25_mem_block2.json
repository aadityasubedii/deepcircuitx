    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the write-back stop signal, 'wb_stop' for interaction with other devices or modules. This is achieved through a logical OR operator (||) combining the signals 'uncached_wb_stop_r' and 'cached_wb_stop_r', such that 'wb_stop' is active when either of them or both are active, reflecting the status of both cached and uncached write-back operations."
