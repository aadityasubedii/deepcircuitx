    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog is assigning a value to `fetch_only_stall`. It dictates when a fetch-only situation occurs, by factoring in the states of `i_fetch_stall` and `o_mem_stall`. The `fetch_only_stall` will assert when `i_fetch_stall` is true and `o_mem_stall` is false, representing a situation where data fetch is stalled but memory operations are not."
