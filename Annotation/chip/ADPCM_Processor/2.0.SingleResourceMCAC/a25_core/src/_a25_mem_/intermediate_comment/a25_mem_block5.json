    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code primarily drives the `void_output` signal. Based on the logical operations conducted, it employs a conditional `OR` operation. The condition for `void_output` to be true depends on either `fetch_only_stall_r` AND `fetch_only_stall` being collectively true, or `fetch_only_stall_r` and `mem_read_data_valid_r` being true concurrently. This likely indicates that `void_output` is a control signal that gets activated under specific conditions related to fetch stalls or memory read operations."
