    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'a25_mem' module undertakes memory operations in a system with cache utilization and control. It uses synchronous design (based on 'clk' and 'reset'), takes various control inputs for fetch, execution, write, and cache control, and output signals intended for data read and write-back control. The module features 'a25_dcache' sub-module to manage cache operations. Internal signals and control flow are used to handle elaborate interactions between memory, cache, data access, and stall conditions."
