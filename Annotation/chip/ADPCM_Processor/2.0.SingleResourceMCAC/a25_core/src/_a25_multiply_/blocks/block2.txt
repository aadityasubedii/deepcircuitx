Comment: 
This block of code is performing a wire assignment operation in Verilog. The means that it is defining a wire `o_out`, and assigns the value of the `product[32:1]` to it. So `product` is a bit vector and `o_out` wire received the data at the 32nd down to the 2nd index of `product`. This operation is being done in a concurrent manner, meaning the value transfer between `product` to `o_out` is instantly updated whenever the `product` changes.
