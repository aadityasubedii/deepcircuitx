The block assigns the next state of flags (`flags_nxt`) to the current output flags (`o_flags`). This is a fundamental part of state progression within the hardware design, where each current state is updated with its corresponding next state value. The process is implemented with the use of Verilog's `assign` keyword. With this block, state transitions of the flags are effectively managed.
