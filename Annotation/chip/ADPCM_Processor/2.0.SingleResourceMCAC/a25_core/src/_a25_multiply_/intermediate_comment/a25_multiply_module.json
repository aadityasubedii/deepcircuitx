    "module": "Module-level comment: The module \"a25_multiply\" performs multiplication operation on two 32-bit inputs (i_a_in, i_b_in), produces a 32-bit product (o_out), and provides status flags (o_flags) and a done signal (o_done). The operations are controlled by clock and reset signals, execute and function inputs, a stall input, and test mode inputs. Internally, operands, intermediate results, and operation progression are managed via signals like multiplier, sum, and count. Different FPGA models are supported with specific adder modules. This module handles operation progression, modes of operation, testing modes, and status updates."
