Comment: 
This block of verilog code is responsible for managing and resetting the acknowledgements due in a queue. It leverages positive edge triggered flip flops, with resets for managing these states. On receipt of a reset signal, the acknowledgement variable 'ack_owed_r' is reset to '0'. In the absence of a reset signal, but presence of a 'push' signal concurrently with an 'in_wreq' signal, and no 'o_ack' signal, 'ack_owed_r' is set to '1'. However, if there is no 'i_req' and there is an 'o_ack', 'ack_owed_r' resets back to '0'. This ensures 'ack_owed_r' is kept consistent with queue behaviour, facilitating synchronized data transfer.
