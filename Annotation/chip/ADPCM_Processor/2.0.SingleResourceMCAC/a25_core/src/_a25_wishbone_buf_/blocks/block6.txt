This block of code handles the read pointer for a buffer system. Upon receiving a rising edge signal from 'reset' or 'clk', it carries its operations. If a reset signal is received, it will set the read pointer 'wbuf_rp_r' to its default state ('d0). Conversely, when there's a clock signal coupled with a pop signal, it toggles the read pointer status by using the bitwise not operation, essentially flipping the current binary state of 'wbuf_rp_r'.
