    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"a25_wishbone_buf\" module aims to act as a write buffer for the Wishbone bus interface. It buffers write requests and processes them in their correct order in respect to read operations. Implementing this functionality involves managing a FIFO buffer storage mechanism along with various control signals like 'push' and 'pop' to manage request handling, and internal signals such as 'wbuf_used_r', 'wbuf_wdata_r' etc to track the operations. It synchronizes operations with clock signals and responds with appropriate output signals indicating completion and validity of requests."
