    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is a synchronous logic block, that is primarily used for data valid signal handling. Upon reset or clock events, the signal 'wait_rdata_valid_r' is set or cleared based on other input signals such as 'o_valid', 'o_write', 'i_accepted' and 'i_rdata_valid'. Specifically, when 'reset' signal is high, it sets 'wait_rdata_valid_r' to 0. In the absence of reset, 'wait_rdata_valid_r' is set to 1 only if 'o_valid' is true, 'o_write' is false, and 'i_accepted' is true. If 'i_rdata_valid' is true, 'wait_rdata_valid_r' is cleared to 0."
