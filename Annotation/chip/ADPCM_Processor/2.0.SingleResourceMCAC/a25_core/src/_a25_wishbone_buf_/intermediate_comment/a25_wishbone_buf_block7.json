    "block_comment": "This block is a clocked logic for managing a write buffer system in a synchronous manner. It resets the buffer registers during a high reset signal. Under normal operation, when \"push\" is initiated, data is stored in the buffers. The values of 'i_wdata', 'i_addr' and 'i_write' inputs are written into the 'wbuf_wdata_r', 'wbuf_addr_r' and 'wbuf_write_r' arrays at the write pointer position 'wbuf_wp_r'. 'i_be' or its complement is written into 'wbuf_be_r' based on 'i_write' flag and after this, the write pointer is toggled for next write."
