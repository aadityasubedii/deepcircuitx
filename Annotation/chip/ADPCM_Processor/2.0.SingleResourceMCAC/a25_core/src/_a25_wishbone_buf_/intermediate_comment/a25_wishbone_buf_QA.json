It includes standard Wishbone inputs and outputs for complex read/write operations.  It specifically handles buffering of write requests and ensures that they're processed in the correct order with respect to read requests. The module has register-based FIFO buffer storage for address, write data, write enable, and write operations. The module works in conjunction to the bus clock and reset signal. It also takes \"request\" and \"acknowledge\" signals into account to manage data flow."
