    "block_comment": "This code block is an assignment operation. In the Verilog RTL code, the 'assign' keyword is used to assign the value of 'i_rdata' to 'o_rdata'. Any time 'i_rdata' changes, 'o_rdata' will be updated with the new value. This assignment operation creates a continuous assignment, implicitly creating an always block in the hardware."
