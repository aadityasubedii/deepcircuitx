    "block_comment": "This block is a logic controller for a buffer space counter. It uses flip-flops which are updated at every positive edge of a reset signal or a clock signal (clk). When a reset signal is received, the counter 'wbuf_used_r' is reset to zero. However, during normal operations (when reser is not asserted), it checks whether data pushes ('push' signal) and data pops ('pop' signal) occurred simultaneously, in which case the counter stays the same. If only a 'push' occurred, it increments the counter, and if only a 'pop' occurred, it decreases the counter accordingly. This way, it accounts for the used buffer space in every clock cycle, providing a real-time snapshot of the used buffer space."
