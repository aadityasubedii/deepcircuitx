Module name: a25_wishbone_buf. 

Module specification: The a25_wishbone_buf is a buffer module designed specifically for the Wishbone bus peripheral interface. Its primary function is to buffer write requests and ensure their processing is in the correct order, relative to read requests. It maintains a FIFO buffer storage mechanism for the addresses, write data, write-enable signal, and write operations. 

There are numerous input and output ports in this module. The input ports include 'clk' (the clock signal), 'reset' (resets the module), 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' (for testing purposes), 'i_req' (the read/write request signal), 'i_write' (indicates whether the request is a write operation), 'i_wdata' (128-bit input data to be written), 'i_be' (byte enable signal), 'i_addr' (the address for the operation), 'i_accepted' (indicates that the output data has been accepted), 'i_rdata' (128-bit read data), 'i_rdata_valid' (indicates whether the read data is valid). The output ports include 'o_rdata' (128-bit read data), 'o_ack' and 'o_valid' (indicate that the read or write request has been completed), 'o_write' (indicates whether the request is a write operation), 'o_wdata' (128-bit data to be written), 'o_be' (byte enable signal), 'o_addr' (the address for the operation).

The internal signals used within the module include 'wbuf_used_r', 'wbuf_wdata_r', 'wbuf_addr_r', 'wbuf_be_r, 'wbuf_write_r', 'wbuf_wp_r','wbuf_rp_r', 'busy_reading_r', 'wait_rdata_valid_r', 'in_wreq', 'push', 'pop', 'ack_owed_r'. The purpose of these signals is to control and monitor the operations of the buffer write requests, handling the usage of the buffer, addresses, data being written, byte enable signals, read/write operations, and indication and control of acknowledgement owed.

The code is divided into several blocks for different functions. The first part of the code defines the module and its inputs and outputs. Then, the internal signals are declared, and their assignments are defined. Further in the code, multiple always blocks are defined to control operations based on clock ticks and reset signal. Finally, output assignments and control signals are determined to finalize the request operations.
