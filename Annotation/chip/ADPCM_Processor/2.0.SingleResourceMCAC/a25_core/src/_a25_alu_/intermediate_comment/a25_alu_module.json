    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'a25_alu' module is an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for a 25-series processor. It takes two 32-bit operands and a 9-bit control input to perform various arithmetic and logical operations. It uses internal signals for handling inputs, performing operations (AND, OR, XOR, zero/sign extend), and managing carry-out and overflow from the adder operation. The output is a result of the operation, along with flags representing the state of the result. The module contains condition-based assignments, specific tasks depending on the target FPGA platform, and flexible extension operations to suit various scenarios."
