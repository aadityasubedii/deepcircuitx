Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles memory request signals in a synchronous digital circuit. Upon activation of either reset or clock signal, the code checks the state of the reset signal. If the reset signal is active, the system nullifies wb_req_r (write-back request register). However, if the reset signal is inactive, wb_req_r is determined by the state of o_wb_req (output writeback request) and i_wb_ready (input writeback ready). The wb_req_r will only be set if there is an output writeback request, and there is no input writeback ready.
