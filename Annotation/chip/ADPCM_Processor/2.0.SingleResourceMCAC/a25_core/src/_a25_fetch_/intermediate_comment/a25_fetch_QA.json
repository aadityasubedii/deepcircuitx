It interacts with an instruction cache (i_cache) and facilitates the retrieval of instructions for execution while managing memory related operations like stalling, addressing, and read-write requests. The module processes both cached and uncached instructions, determines the fetch stall condition, and also handles write back requests. It handles the case where the instruction is not cacheable, prepares data for write back, and reads data accordingly. The module interfaces with other parts of the processor system, like handling signals for system readiness and instruction validity."
