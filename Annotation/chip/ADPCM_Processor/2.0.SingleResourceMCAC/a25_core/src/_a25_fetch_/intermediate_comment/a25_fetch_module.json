    "module": "Module-level comment:\n\nThe a25_fetch module facilitates instruction fetching in a processor, interfacing with both cache and non-cache memory. It uses inputs and outputs to manage stalls, addressing, write-back, and cache operations. Internally, it uses specific signals to determine cache status, stall conditions, and write-back operations. Special blocks within the module extract target data from addressed locations and prepare the next instruction fetch. This module also instantiates the 'a25_icache' sub-module to handle Instruction Cache interactions specifically."
