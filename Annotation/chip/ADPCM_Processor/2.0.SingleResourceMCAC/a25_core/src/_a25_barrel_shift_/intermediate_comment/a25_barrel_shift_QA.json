It includes inputs for clock, reset, scan_enable, test_mode, data, shift amount, shift immediate zero, shift function, as well as carry in signal. It also produces outputs inclusive of shift result, carry out, and stall. Two internal barrel shifters namely: u_a25_shifter_full and u_a25_shifter_quick perform the actual shifting work. The type of shifter to use (quick or full) depends on the shift amount. If the shift amount is too large, the module stalls and switches to full mode. If the shift amount is not large, a quick shift is utilized."
