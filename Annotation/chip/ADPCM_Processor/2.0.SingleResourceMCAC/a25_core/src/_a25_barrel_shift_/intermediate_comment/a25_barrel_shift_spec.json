    "spec": "Module name: a25_barrel_shift.\n\nModule specification: \n\nThe a25_barrel_shift is a Verilog module that defines a 32-bit barrel shifter with both quick and full modes of operation. It is used when a variation in shift speed is needed based on the shift amount. The module is served by several input ports which include clk for timing, reset for initializing registers, scan_enable and test_mode for testing, i_in as 32-bit input data for shift operation, i_carry_in, i_shift_amount for controlling the shift amount, i_shift_imm_zero, and i_function for indicating the operation to be performed. The module yields outputs through o_out (32-bit shift result), o_carry_out (final carry-out from shift operation), and o_stall (stalls the module in case of an extensive shift amount). \n\nInternally, the module uses signals like quick_out, quick_carry_out, full_out, full_carry_out, full_out_r, full_carry_out_r, and use_quick_r for handling and controlling various aspects like shift outcomes, carry-outs, and shifter selections between quick and full modes. The module hosts two internal instances of a25_shifter, one for full mode and the other for quick mode, which execute the actual shifting process. \n\nThe module's operation is further enhanced by use_quick_r that determines whether to use quick or full mode for shifting operation. Moreover, the code contains conditions assigned to output signals o_stall, o_out, and o_carry_out to control stalling, shift operation outcome, and carry-out based on whether quick or full shift mode is in use. An always block updates the registered versions of full_out, full_carry_out, and use_quick_r either during reset or at the positive edge of the clock. This ensures synchronization with the clock cycle and facilitates seamless transition between quick and full shift modes.",

It includes inputs for clock, reset, scan_enable, test_mode, data, shift amount, shift immediate zero, shift function, as well as carry in signal. It also produces outputs inclusive of shift result, carry out, and stall. Two internal barrel shifters namely: u_a25_shifter_full and u_a25_shifter_quick perform the actual shifting work. The type of shifter to use (quick or full) depends on the shift amount. If the shift amount is too large, the module stalls and switches to full mode. If the shift amount is not large, a quick shift is utilized."
