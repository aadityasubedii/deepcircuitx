    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module manages and tests a digital unit 'a25_core' using a method known as scan testing. It has inputs for controlling internal operations ('clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', 'test_mode') and outputs to observe the scan results ('scan_out0' to 'scan_out4'). The code works by leveraging these inputs to manipulate the 'a25_core' behavior and then assesses its state through the scan outputs. It also contains provisions for setting up the testing environment and cleaning up after the test."
