Comment: 
This block initializes the simulation setup and the various control signals in the system. The time format for the simulation is set to nanoseconds. If SDFSCAN is defined, it annotates the SDF timings from the specified SDF file to the given design hierarchy. The clock, reset and various scan input signals are initialized to zero to start the operation. The test_mode and scan_enable flags are also set to zero, marking the system not in test or scan mode. To end the initialization, '$finish;' is used to imply the stopping of the simulation.
