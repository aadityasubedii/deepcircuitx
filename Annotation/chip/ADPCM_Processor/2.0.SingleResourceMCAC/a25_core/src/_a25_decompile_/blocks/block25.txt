Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog is responsible for assigning instruction names based on the opcode and instruction type (itype). Implementing a hardware version of a switch-case statement, it examines the opcode and the type of instruction, then assigns the appropriate Assembly mnemonic (e.g., 'add', 'sub', etc.) to the `xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE` output variable. If `execute_now` flag is not active, it retains the previously assigned instruction mnemonic. If no match is found from the exhaustive list of options, 'unknown' is assigned to flag an unrecognizable instruction.
