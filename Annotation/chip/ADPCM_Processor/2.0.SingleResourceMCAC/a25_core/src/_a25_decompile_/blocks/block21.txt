Comment: 
This Verilog RTL code block triggers on a rising edge of the reset or clock signal. If a reset is asserted, the block does nothing; whereas if a reset is not asserted, the block monitors several inputs, including program counter selection, write-enable, core stall status, instruction execution status, interrupt signals, type of instruction and execution address. When all conditions are met, it writes a formatted string into a file specified by 'decompile_file'. This formatted string provides information about the jump instruction in the program, including the source and destination addresses of the jump, as well as the values of registers r0 and r1.
