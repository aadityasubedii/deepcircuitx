This block of Verilog code defines a task called fwrite_hex_drop_zeros, which takes two 32-bit inputs: a file and a number ("num"). The purpose of this task is to write a given input number into a file in hexadecimal format while omitting leading zeros in the number. The function achieves this using conditional statements that check the topmost 4 bits of the number and whether they are zero. If they are, the task pursues further and checks the next 4 bits. If these are also zero, the condition proceeds to the next 4 bits, and so on until it finds non-zero 4-bit segment or reaches the least significant 4 bits. It then writes the remaining bits (which do not start with zero) to a file in hexadecimal format.
