Comment: 
This block of code performs a word shifting task (`wshift`). It operates based on `execute_instruction` value and `shift_imm` value. If `execute_instruction[6:5]` value doesn't equal `LSL` (Logical Shift Left) or `shift_imm` doesn't equal zero, it enters a switch case determined by `execute_instruction[6:5]` value. For each case, it writes specific shifting operation (`lsl`, `lsr`, `asr`, `rrx` or `ror`) to `decompile_file`. If `execute_instruction[6:5]` doesn't equal `2'd3` or `shift_imm` doesn't equal zero, it will also write the `shift_imm` value to the `decompile_file`.
