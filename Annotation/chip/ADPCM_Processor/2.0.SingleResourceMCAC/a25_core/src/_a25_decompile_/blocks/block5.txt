The function 'get_32bit_signal' is designed to return 32-bit signal values from the execute stage of a pipelined processor. Depending on a 3-bit input 'num', the function fetches signal values from different parts of the processor execution stage - like program counter next address, instruction output address, data output address, output write data to some intermediate and final stages. The implementation involves a switch-case construct to map input 'num' to corresponding 32-bit signal values.
