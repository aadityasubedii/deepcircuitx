Module name: a25_decompile. Module specification: This module is a decompiler for an ARM processor (likely ARM v2a) that generates human-readable disassembly of executed instructions. It takes inputs such as clk, reset, scan_enable, test_mode, i_core_stall, i_instruction, i_instruction_valid, i_instruction_undefined, i_instruction_execute, i_interrupt, i_interrupt_state, i_instruction_address, i_pc_sel, and i_pc_wen, which provide information about the processor state and current instruction. The module doesn't have explicit output ports; instead, it writes the decompiled instruction information to a file specified by the A25_DECOMPILE_FILE macro. Internally, it uses signals like imm32, offset12, reg_n, opcode, condition, and itype to decode and format instructions.
