    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily used for instruction decoding in Verilog RTL code for a CPU design. It extracts important fields from an instruction, like opcode, condition, shift operation type, and different register operands, which are then used in the subsequent stages of the execution pipeline. This block uses 'assign' statements to map bits from the input instruction to the corresponding fields based on the instruction format. Additionally, it defines several instruction types 'itype' and 'mtrans_itype' depending on different portions of the instruction bits. The block also creates flags for conditional operations and control flow operations, among others. It uses bit-selection and bit-manipulation operations for achieving its function. Notably, there are also multiple condition checks to differentiate between various CPU operations."
