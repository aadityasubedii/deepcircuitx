    "block_comment": "This function block is designed to return specific one bit system signals based upon the 3-bit input 'num'. The function utilizes a case statement on the input 'num' to determine which signal to return. If 'num' is 0, the write-enable signal from the execute block is returned; if 'num' is 1, the memory-stall signal from the amber block is returned; if 'num' is 2, the data-address-valid signal from the execute block is returned; for value 'num' equals 3, the core-stall signal from the Amber block is returned; and finally, if 'num' is 4, the memory-read-data-valid signal from the write-back block is returned."
