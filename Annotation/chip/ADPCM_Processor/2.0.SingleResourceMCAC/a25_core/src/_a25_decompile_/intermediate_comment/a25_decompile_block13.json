    "block_comment": "This block is a task responsible for handling different kinds of register operations based on various opcode conditions. It employs conditional logic to check different opcode conditions and accordingly generates decompiled strings containing opcode information, register addresses and immediates (if present). It extensively uses $fwrite statement to write register and immediate information into a file. The task also uses multiple helper functions (warmreg, wshift, wshiftreg) to carry out certain operations on the registers depending on the opcode. These functions are called conditionally, depending on whether certain opcodes are present, and whether an immediate is used or not."
