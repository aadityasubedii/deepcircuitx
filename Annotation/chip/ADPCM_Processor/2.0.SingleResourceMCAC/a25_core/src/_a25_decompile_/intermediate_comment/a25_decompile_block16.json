    "block_comment": "The block of code is basically a conditional task in Verilog that operates using a 32-bit register named shift_amount and the instruction details held in the execute_instruction register. It processes an input instruction and then, based on the 24th bit of the input, modifies the shift_amount register and makes a branch decision. When the 24th bit is set, it inverts the lowest 24 bits of the instruction, adds 1 to it and assigns the resultant value to shift_amount, then subtracts this from the value held by the 21st register. If the 24th bit is not set, the lowest 24 bits of instruction are directly assigned to shift_amount, which is then added to the value from the 21st register. In both cases, the resultant value is written to a file."
