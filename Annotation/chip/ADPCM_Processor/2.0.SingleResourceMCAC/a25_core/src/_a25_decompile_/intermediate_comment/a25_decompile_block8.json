    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog code block defines a task \"warmreg\" with an input \"regnum\" which is a 4-bit number. The purpose of this task is to print the correct register name corresponding to the \"regnum\" into a file called \"decompile_file\". If \"regnum\" is less than 12, it simply concatenates \"r\" with \"regnum\". However, for \"regnum\" between 12 and 15, specific strings (\"ip\", \"sp\", \"lr\", \"pc\") are printed which correspond to specific registers in digital systems."
