    "block_comment": "This function block retrieves a specific register's value from the register bank. It accepts a 5-bit input that represents the register number, and returns a 32-bit value that represents the corresponding register's value. Using a Verilog case structure, the function maps the input register number to the appropriate output register value. This includes direct register mapping for values from 0 to 15, as well as specific mappings for registers 16 to 21. The value returned corresponds to the current state of the specified register in the register bank."
