    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a task, named 'wshiftreg', which is used to write shift register commands into a decompile file dependent on the value of bits 5 and 6 of the execute_instruction variable. This is achieved by using a case statement on bits 5 and 6 of the execute_instruction variable, where each binary value corresponds to a different shift register command; logical shift left, logical shift right, arithmetic shift right and rotate right, respectively. After writing to the file, the task then calls another task, 'warmreg', with 'reg_s' as an input argument."
