    "block_comment": "The code block functions as a task named `wcond` that writes condition codes into a file based on the value of the variable `condition`. The 4-bit `condition` is analyzed in a case statement, and for each possible hexadecimal value from 0 to E, a corresponding condition mnemonic string such as \"eq\", \"ne\", \"cs\", and so on, is written in the `decompile_file`. If `condition` doesn't match any case, the string \"nv\" is written by default."
