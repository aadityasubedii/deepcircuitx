    "block_comment": "This block handles interrupts in a Verilog-based system. It uses a positive-edge-triggered clock and a reset signal to help manage the system state. On each clock tick or reset signal, it checks if there is a stall in the core system, and if not, captures the interrupt type. Depending on the interrupt type and state, it writes the interrupt type (like \"data abort\", \"firq\", \"irq\", or \"unknown type\") and its return address to a decompile file using a case statement. Different return addresses are logged based on the interrupt type. This block thereby helps in identifying, managing, and logging interrupts."
