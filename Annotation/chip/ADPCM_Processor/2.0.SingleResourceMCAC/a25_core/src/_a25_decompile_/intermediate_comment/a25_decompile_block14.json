    "block_comment": "The task 'swap_args' in the provided Verilog code is responsible for swapping the arguments. The function starts by warming the 'reg_d' register followed by writing to the decompile_file with a comma and a white space. Then the 'reg_m' register is warmed and the decompile_file is written into again, this time adding a comma and an opening square bracket. Finally, the 'reg_n' register is warmed and a closing square bracket is written into the decompile_file, thus successfully completing the argument swapping task."
