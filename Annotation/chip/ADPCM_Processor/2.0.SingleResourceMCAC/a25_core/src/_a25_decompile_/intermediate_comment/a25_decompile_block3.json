    "block_comment": "This Verilog function block, named `get_4bit_signal`, is designed to output a 4-bit signal based on a 3-bit input. The function achieves its functionality through a case statement which checks the value of `num`, an input to the function. If the value of `num` is 0, the function sets `get_4bit_signal` equal to the value of the `U_EXECUTE.o_byte_enable` signal. If the `num` is 1, it sets `get_4bit_signal` equal to the value of the `U_WB.mem_load_rd_r` signal. In all other cases, the function does not set the output, which in Verilog means, it holds its previous value."
