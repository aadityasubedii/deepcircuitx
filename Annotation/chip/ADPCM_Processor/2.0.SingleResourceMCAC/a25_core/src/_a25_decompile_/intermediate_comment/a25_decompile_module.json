    "module": "Module-level comment: This module decompiles ARM processor instructions, generating human-readable disassembly for debugging and analysis. It decodes various instruction types, formats them into assembly language, and writes the output to a file. The module processes inputs related to instruction execution and processor state, tracks interrupts and jumps, and handles different instruction formats. It uses internal signals for decoding and formatting, implementing conditional execution and various addressing modes."
