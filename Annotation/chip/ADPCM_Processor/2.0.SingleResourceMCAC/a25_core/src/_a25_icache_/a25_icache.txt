Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable instruction cache for an A25 processor. It manages cache operations including hit/miss detection, line filling, and flushing. The cache uses separate tag and data RAMs for each way, supports multiple ways, and implements a pseudo-random replacement policy. It interfaces with the processor core and external memory, handling read requests and write-backs. The module uses a state machine to control cache operations and includes logic for cache initialization, read buffering, and stall generation.
