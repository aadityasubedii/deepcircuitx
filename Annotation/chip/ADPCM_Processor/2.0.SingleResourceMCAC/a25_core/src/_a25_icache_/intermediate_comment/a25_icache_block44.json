    "block_comment": "This Verilog block handles a synchronous reset and updates the 'miss_address' based on the current state of 'c_state'. On either a positive clock edge or 'reset' signal, the block checks if 'reset' is high. If true, 'miss_address' is reset to 0. Otherwise, if 'c_state' is in 'CS_IDLE', 'miss_address' gets updated with the 'i_address'."
