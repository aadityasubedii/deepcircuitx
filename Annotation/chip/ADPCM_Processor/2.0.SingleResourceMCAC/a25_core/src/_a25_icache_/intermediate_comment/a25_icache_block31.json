    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a busy signal for a cache design system. It's constructed using the 'assign' keyword which indicates that the given Boolean condition will be continually evaluated, and the output will change whenever the input changes. The 'cache_busy_stall' signal becomes high when either the cache is in the 'TURN_AROUND' state with the 'enable' signal activated and no cache hit on the read buffer, or when it's in the 'INIT' state. It essentially indicates when the cache is busy and cannot accept new operations. The logic condition is evaluated with high-level semantics, showing the use of logical AND and OR operators along with comparison for state matching and data conditions.\n"
