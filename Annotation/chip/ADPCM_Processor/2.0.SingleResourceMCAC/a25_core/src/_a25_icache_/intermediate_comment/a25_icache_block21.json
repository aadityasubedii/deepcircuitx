    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic module associated with a reset and clock signal that manages cache tag validity. It overwrites the valid bits based on certain values of tag data if not in an idle state. When a reset happens, the valid bits (valid_bits_r) gets reset to default value. Otherwise, when in an idle state, the valid bits (valid_bits_r) is loaded with the most significant bit (MSB) of the tag data of four different ways of a cache subsystem."
