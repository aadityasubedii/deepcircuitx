    "block_comment": "The purpose of this block is to conditionally raise an error message when a cache hit occurs in more than one cache way. It operates synchronously with respect to the positive edges of the reset or clock signals. When the reset is active, no operation occurs. Else, when the sum of `data_hit_way[0]` and `data_hit_way[1]` exceeds 1, an error message \"Hit in more than one cache ways!\" is printed to the user interface, indicating an unexpected multi-hit scenario."
