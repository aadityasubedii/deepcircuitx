    "block_comment": "This block of code is a state machine decoder in Verilog which is used to decode the states of a state machine. The functionality is achieved via Verilog\u2019s conditional operator (? :). If the condition before the '?' is true, the value before the ':' is taken otherwise, the value after \u2018:\u2019 is taken. The state machine has multiple state constants such as CS_INIT, CS_IDLE, CS_FILL0 etc., and the conditional operator analyzes the 'c_state'. If it's equal to one of the defined states, it will assign the respective string to 'xC_STATE'. If 'c_state' is none of those, \"UNKNOWN\" will be assigned to 'xC_STATE'."
