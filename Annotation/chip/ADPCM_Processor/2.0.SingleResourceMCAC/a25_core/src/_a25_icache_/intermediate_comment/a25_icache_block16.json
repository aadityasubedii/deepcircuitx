    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to determine the next way in a 3-way decision system, based on the current valid bits and a random number input. It is implemented using the 'pick_way' function which accepts valid bits from the system and a random number as parameters to evaluate and assign the next way for the system. The selection process only goes into effect if the condition where WAYS is equal to 3 is satisfied."
