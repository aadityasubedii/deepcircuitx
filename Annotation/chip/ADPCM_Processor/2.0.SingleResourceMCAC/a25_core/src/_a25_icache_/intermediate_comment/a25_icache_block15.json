    "block_comment": "This function, called 'pick_way', selects a way based on the input valid bits and a random number. It takes a valid_bit array and a 4-bit random number as input. If any valid_bit at index [0,1,2] is zero, the function assigns 'pick_way' as '3'b001', '3'b010', or '3'b100' correspondingly. If none are zero, then it selects 'pick_way' based on a part of the random number. The indexes by random number are ['3'd0', '3'd1', '3'd2'] \u2192 '3'b010', ['3'd2', '3'd3', '3'd4'] \u2192 '3'b100', and otherwise, '3'b001'."
