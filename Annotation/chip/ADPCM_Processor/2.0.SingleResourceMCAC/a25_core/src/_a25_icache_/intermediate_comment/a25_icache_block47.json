    "block_comment": "This block controls the read buffer's status in a larger system, managing its data, address, and validity flags. Its operation is governed by a master clock; on a positive edge of this clock or a system reset, the block clears all buffer data. If the cache is being flushed, the read buffer is marked as invalid. If a fill state is reached and a ready signal received, the buffer is loaded up with new address and data and marked valid. Alternatively, if a request is made, the buffer is marked as invalid."
