    "block_comment": "This block of code corresponds to a cache memory checking state that is specifically configured for an 8-way set associative cache architecture. In this context, \"WAYS\" indicates the number of cache lines per set in the cache memory system. The condition check (WAYS == 8) verifies the current configuration of the cache to be 8-way. Post this, if the condition is satisfied, with a named begin-end block tagged as `check_hit_8ways`, the specific operations for checking cache hit or miss status for the 8-way system are performed."
