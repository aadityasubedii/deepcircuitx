    "block_comment": "This block is a function in Verilog, termed as `pick_way`, used to select a particular way or path based on certain conditions. It takes in two inputs: a set of valid bits and a random number. For processing, it checks if the first bit in the valid bits is a '0', then the function assigns '01' as the preferred path, and if the second bit in the valid bits is '0', the function assigns '10'. If neither of these conditions are met, it takes a subset (bits 3 to 1) of the provided random number and based on its value, it selects between '10' and '01', where '10' is chosen for values '0', '3', '5', '6', and '01' is chosen for all others."
