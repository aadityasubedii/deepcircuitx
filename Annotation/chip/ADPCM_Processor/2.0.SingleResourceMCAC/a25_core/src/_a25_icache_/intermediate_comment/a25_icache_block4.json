    "block_comment": "This block is designed to check and handle cache hits in a system. It does this by monitoring the status of `data_hit_way` (which signifies cache hits) at every positive edge of reset or clock signal. If the sum of the entries in `data_hit_way` array exceeds 1 during a clock cycle, it outputs an error message indicating that there has been a hit in more than one cache way, contrary to the design requirement that only one cache way should be hit at a time."
