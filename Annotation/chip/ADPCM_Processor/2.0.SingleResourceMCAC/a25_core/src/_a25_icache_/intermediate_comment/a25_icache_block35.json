    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the write enable signal for a tag in a cache memory system. The write enable signal is set based on the state of several other signals. If there's a read missing fill event, if an invalidate, fill, or init signal is selected, then the tag will be allowed to write by setting the signal to 1. Otherwise, in cases where core signal is selected or neither signals are active, the write enable signal is set to 0 to prevent writing."
