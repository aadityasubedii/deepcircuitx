    "block_comment": "This block assigns the 'tag_address' based on the condition of 'read_miss_fill' and 'source_sel[C_INIT]'. If 'read_miss_fill' is true, 'tag_address' takes the value of the 'miss_address' sliced from 'CACHE_ADDR32_MSB' to 'CACHE_ADDR32_LSB'. If 'read_miss_fill' is false and 'source_sel[C_INIT]' is true, 'tag_address' takes the value of 'init_count' sliced from 'CACHE_ADDR_WIDTH-1' to '0'. In all other cases, 'tag_address' takes the value of 'address'. The employed ternary '?' operators facilitate rapid multiplexing between these different input cases."
