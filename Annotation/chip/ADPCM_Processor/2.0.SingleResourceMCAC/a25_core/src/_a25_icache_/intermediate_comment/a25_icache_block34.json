    "block_comment": "This code block in Verilog is used to assign the value of the 'enable' signal. The value of 'enable' is determined by the logical AND operation of 'i_select' and 'i_cache_enable'. The 'enable' signal will be set to true only if both 'i_select' and 'i_cache_enable' signals are true."
