    "block_comment": "The function 'pick_way' selects one of the possible ways from the 'valid_bits' received as inputs. It checks each bit sequentially from bit[0] to bit[3] to find a zero. If it finds one, it sets 'pick_way' to the corresponding binary code (i.e., 4'b0001 for bit 0, 4'b0010 for bit 1, and so on). If all bits are ones, it decides the 'pick_way' based on predefined rules using the value of 'random_num'."
