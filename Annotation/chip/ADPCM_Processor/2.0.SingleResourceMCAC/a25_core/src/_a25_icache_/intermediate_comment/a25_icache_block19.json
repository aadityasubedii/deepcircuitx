    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles data retrieval from a cache memory system. It customizes its reading pattern based on the number of ways the cache is configured to have, denoted by the 'WAYS' parameter. Using a conditional (if-else) structure inside a generate loop, it chooses between different structures for associating input ('data_hit_way') with output ('hit_rdata') lines, varying from 2 ways to 8 ways. If data is hit in any of these ways, it assigns the associated way's data to the output. If there's no hit in any ways, it assigns a default value to the output."
