    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is responsible for activating the write enable signal for a specific cache way line. The signal `data_wenable_way[i]` is activated if there's a need to fill the cache from the source (`source_sel[C_FILL]` is high), or a read request has missed and requires filling (`read_miss_fill` is high) and the cache way line indexed by `i` is selected (`select_way[i]` is high). This function is achieved by using the logical OR (||) and AND (&&) operations on the above conditions."
