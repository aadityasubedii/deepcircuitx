    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for executing certain computations conditionally if the value of `WAYS` is equal to 4. It utilizes an `else if` statement to check this condition and on passing this test, the code block labelled `valid_bits_4ways` is executed. The label allows this section of the conditionally executed code to be referred uniquely for later debugging or modification requirements."
