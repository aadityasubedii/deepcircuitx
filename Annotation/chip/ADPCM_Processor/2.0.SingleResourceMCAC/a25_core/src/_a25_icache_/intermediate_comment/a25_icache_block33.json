    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code specifies an assignment operation. The operand `idle_hit` receives the bit-wise logical OR reduction operation of the vector `data_hit_way`. Simply put, it sets `idle_hit` as true if at least one bit in `data_hit_way` is high (1); otherwise, it remains false (0)."
