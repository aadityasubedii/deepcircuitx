The cache has a configurable amount of cache lines, cache words per line, and ways. It uses certain parameters like address width, tag width, and others calculated based on the parameters defined. The module is designed with both sequential and combinatorial logic. It's dynamically configured to manage cache hits and cache misses, and it interacts with an external data storage (represented here by tag and data SRAMs) to store and fetch cache lines. The read data is then selected based on hit-or-miss conditions. It also supports cache flushing operation. The cache subsystem's stall operation is managed based on several criteria as well. Apart from standard cache operation it also seems to support a test mode and a scan_enable signal that is likely for JTAG or similar hardware debug interface use."
