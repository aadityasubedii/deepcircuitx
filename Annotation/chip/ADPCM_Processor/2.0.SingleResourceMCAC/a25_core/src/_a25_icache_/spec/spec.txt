Module name: a25_icache. Module specification: The a25_icache module implements a configurable instruction cache for an A25 processor. It supports multiple ways, configurable cache lines, and words per line. The module interfaces with the processor core through input signals like clk, reset, i_core_stall, i_select, i_address, i_address_nxt, i_cache_enable, and i_cache_flush, and output signals o_stall and o_read_data. It also interacts with external memory through o_wb_req, i_wb_read_data, and i_wb_ready signals. Internally, it uses signals like c_state for cache state control, source_sel for data source selection, and various address and data signals for managing cache operations. The module is structured with separate tag and data RAM blocks for each way, implements cache hit/miss logic, and includes
