Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for assigning a string value to the variable `xSOURCE_SEL`, serving as source selection based on the true value in the `source_sel` associative array. A conditional (ternary operator '?') is used to achieve this selection. It checks each condition `source_sel[C_CORE]`, `source_sel[C_INIT]`, etc., and assigns the corresponding string "C_CORE", "C_INIT", etc., to `xSOURCE_SEL`. If none of the values are true, it defaults to "UNKNON".
