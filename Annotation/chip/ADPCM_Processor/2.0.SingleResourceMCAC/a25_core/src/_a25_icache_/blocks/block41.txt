This block of Verilog code is responsible for managing the write-back (wb) address for data. Primarily, it handles the two potential scenarios: reset state and normal operations. Upon a reset signal, the code initializes the `wb_address` to 0. In normal operation, if a write-back request `o_wb_req` is made, the write-back address `wb_address` is set to the incoming address `i_address`. Alternatively, if the write-back is ready `i_wb_ready` and the fill state is active, the `wb_address` is updated by shifting the bits and incrementing the third and fourth bit by 1, with the last two bits set to 0. The always block is triggered on the positive edge of either the `reset` or the `clk` signal.
