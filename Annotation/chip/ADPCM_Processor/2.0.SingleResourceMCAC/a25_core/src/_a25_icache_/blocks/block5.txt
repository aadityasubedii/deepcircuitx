Comment: 
Without the entire context of the code, I can only give a projection of a comment for this specific line of code based on my experience with Verilog RTL. Here it is:

"This conditional block checks for a hit in a 4-way set associative cache. If the 'WAYS' variable equals to 4, the code block 'check_hit_4ways' is initiated. The specific processes within this block would depend on its contents, likely involving a comparison of some sort against the cache to determine a 'hit' or 'miss' scenario."
