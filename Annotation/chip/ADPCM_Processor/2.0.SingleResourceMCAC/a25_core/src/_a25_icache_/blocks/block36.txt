Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for triggering a cache fill operation upon a read miss. Using the `assign` keyword in Verilog, it describes combinatorial logic that checks if the current state of the cache (`c_state`) is in the fill state (`CS_FILL3`) and whether the write-back (`i_wb_ready`) is ready. If both conditions are satisfied, a high output is generated to initiate the cache fill operation.
