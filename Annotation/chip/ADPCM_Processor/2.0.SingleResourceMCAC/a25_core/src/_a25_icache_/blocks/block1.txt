Comment: 
This block of code generates an error message for unsupported configuration settings. It is triggered initially, printing an error message indicating that the number of selected ways does not match the acceptable values. It then instructs the user to set the 'A25_ICACHE_WAYS' variable in the 'a25_config_defines.v' file to either 2, 3, 4, or 8.
