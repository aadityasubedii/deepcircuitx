This block functions to select the 'next_way' in a scenario with 4 options (4-way). The selection mechanism involves the 'pick_way' operation, which is implemented on 'valid_bits_r' and 'random_num'. 'Valid_bits_r' indicates the validity of the paths, and 'random_num' is used to introduce randomness in the path selection process.
