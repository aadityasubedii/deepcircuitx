Comment: 
The block is responsible for data way hit detection in a cache system. It compares the read data from a chosen way (given by `tag_rdata_way[i]`) against the upper bits of the address bus (`i_address[31:TAG_ADDR32_LSB]`). The check is only performed when the cache state (`c_state`) is idle (CS_IDLE). A Boolean result is produced, indicating whether or not a hit occurred in the particular way for the given input address.
