Comment: 
The block is responsible for assigning a value to 'tag_wdata'. The assignment is conditional and depends on the 'read_miss_fill' signal. If 'read_miss_fill' is true, 'tag_wdata' gets assigned a concatenation of 1'd1 and select bits of 'miss_address'. If 'read_miss_fill' is false, 'tag_wdata' is filled with zeros. The number of zeros equals the defined 'TAG_WIDTH'.
