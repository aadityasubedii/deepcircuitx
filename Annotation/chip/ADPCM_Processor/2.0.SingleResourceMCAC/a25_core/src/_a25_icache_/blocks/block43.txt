Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for handling a synchronous reset for a register titled "address_r". The design leverages a clock edge (positive) triggered always block to check for either a reset signal or a clock signal. When a reset signal is asserted, the address register ("address_r") is set to zero. If there is a clock signal and no reset, then the address value chosen is stored in the "address_r" register by assigning the contents of register "address_c" it.
