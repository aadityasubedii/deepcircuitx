This block of code defines two primary logic assignments related to memory management in a cached context. Firstly, the `fill_state` is assigned a boolean value that becomes true if the cache state (`c_state`) is in the `CS_FILL3` state. Secondly, a `wb_hit` (write-back hit) logic level is assigned based on three conditions: if the input address (`i_address`) equals the write-back address (`wb_address`), if a write-back is ready (`i_wb_ready`) and if `fill_state` is true. This block essentially checks the status of a cache line fill and indicates whether a write-back operation can proceed.
