This block handles the condition of a multicache hit scenario. The block is triggered at the rising edge of either the reset or clock signal. If the reset signal is active, it doesn't perform any action right now (probably meant for any further implementation). However, in normal operation (when reset is not active), this block verifies if the sum of data hits in three cache ways is greater than 1. If this scenario occurs, it is seen as an error and it triggers a testbench error message, displaying "Hit in more than one cache ways!".
