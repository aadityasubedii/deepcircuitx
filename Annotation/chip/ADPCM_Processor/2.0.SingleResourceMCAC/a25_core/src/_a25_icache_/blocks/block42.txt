Comment: 
The provided block is geared towards flagging an invalid read operation in a Verilog memory module. It accomplishes this by matching the input address (`i_address`) with a previously stored address (`address_r`). If they don't match, the output `invalid_read` is set to 1, otherwise it stays at 0, indicating that the requested read operation is not aligned with the current memory state.
