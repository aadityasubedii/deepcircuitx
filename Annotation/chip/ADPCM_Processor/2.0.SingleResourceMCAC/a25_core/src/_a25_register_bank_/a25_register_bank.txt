Module-level Comment: The a25_register_bank module is designed to manage a register bank in a 32-bit RISC system, supporting various modes (user, supervisor, IRQ, FIQ) and actions such as read/write operations. The module operates based on various inputs for modes, selection, clock, resets, and test-modes, and outputs corresponding register values. The internal logic utilizes Verilog's 'always' and 'assign' syntaxes, with multiple control and operation signals to regulate and synchronize the processes. Special registers are used for different operation modes. This module provides a flexible and efficient way to control a register bank in a complex RISC system.
