This block of Verilog code maps the current and next statuses of the Register 15 'r15'. The current value 'r15_out_rm' and the next value 'r15_out_rm_nxt' are the combination of status flags, IRQ mask, FIRQ mask, and the current mode of execution, where the former uses the present value of 'r15' and the latter uses the contents of the program counter 'i_pc'. Thus, the purpose of this block of code seems to be to keep 'r15' updated with the system state after every fetch-execute cycle and prepare it for the next cycle.
