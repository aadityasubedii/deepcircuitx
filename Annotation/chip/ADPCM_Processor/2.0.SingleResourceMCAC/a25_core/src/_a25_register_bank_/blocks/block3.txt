This block of code serves as a multiplexer for selecting specific registers based on the `i_rs_sel` input. It utilizes a case statement that checks various 4-bit values of `i_rs_sel` and assigns the respective `rX_out` or `rX_rds` (where X is the number in the range of 0 to 14) to the output `o_rd`. If none of the specified conditions are met, the register `r15_out_rm_nxt` is selected by default.
