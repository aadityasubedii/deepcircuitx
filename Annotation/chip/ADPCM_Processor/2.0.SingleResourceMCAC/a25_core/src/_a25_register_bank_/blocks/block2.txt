This block selects one of the 16 registers to be output, based on a 4-bit selector. It uses a conditional operator (?:), also known as a ternary operator in Verilog, to select the appropriate output register depending on the value of the input selector i_rn_sel. When the value of i_rn_sel ranges from 4'd0 to 4'd14, the corresponding register rX_out (where X ranges from 0 to 14) is selected and if none of these conditions match, r15_out_rn is selected by default.
