Specifically, it can handle data transfers, storage, and selection in various operation modes including usr, svc, irq, and firq. This register bank supports read/write operations involving a variety of registers (r0 to r15). The functionality is controlled through multiple input signals representing different modes, selection bits and enable signals. The module outputs the selected register data according to its functionality. It also handles a 'reset' input to initialize or reset the system. Also, the module includes test support features such as 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode'."
