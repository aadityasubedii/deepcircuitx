    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is a selector that assigns an output 'o_rm' based on the value of the input selector 'i_rm_sel'. 'o_pc' is assigned the value of 'r15_out_rn'. For 'o_rm', a 4-bit-wide selector 'i_rm_sel' is used to decide from which 'r*_out' line the output 'o_rm' takes its value. If 'i_rm_sel' equals a certain 4-bit value, 'o_rm' takes its corresponding 'r*_out' value. If none of the conditions met, 'r15_out_rm' is assigned to 'o_rm' serving as a default condition."
