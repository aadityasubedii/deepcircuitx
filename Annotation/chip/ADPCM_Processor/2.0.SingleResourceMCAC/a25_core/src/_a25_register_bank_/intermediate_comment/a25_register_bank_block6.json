    "block_comment": "This block is for mode-dependent register read selection. The mode of operation is determined by i_mode_rds_exec[], and based on this mode, the correct register is read. For registers r8 to r12, the FIRQ mode leads to read from the corresponding 'firq' register, otherwise, the original register is read. For registers r13 and r14, the mode also has an influence. In user mode (USR), the original register is read, in supervisor mode (SVC), the corresponding 'svc' register is read. For an IRQ or if none of the conditions are satisfied, 'firq' register is used."
