    "block_comment": "I'm sorry, but the provided code isn't giving me enough information to generate a summary. It is a single keyword `endmodule` which signifies the end of a module in Verilog, not an entire block of code. In order to process the raw data, we will need the full module or block of code which includes inputs, outputs, and internal logic. Once we have that, we can create a brief but accurate summary explaining the function of the block and details on how it works. This can then be fed to the language model for code comment generation."
