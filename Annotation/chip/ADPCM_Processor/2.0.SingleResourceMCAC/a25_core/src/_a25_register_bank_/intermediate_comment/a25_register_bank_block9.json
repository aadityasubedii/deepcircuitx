    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is for conditionally assigning register outputs based on various execution modes. If the 'firq_exec' condition is true, the outputs r8_out to r12_out are assigned the respective 'firq' register values. Otherwise, the outputs are assigned the register values with the same name. The outputs of r13_out and r14_out depend on multiple conditions - 'usr_exec', 'svc_exec', and 'irq_exec'. If any of these conditions are true, 'r13_out' and 'r14_out' are assigned the respective 'svc', 'irq' or 'usr' registers, else they are assigned 'firq' register values."
