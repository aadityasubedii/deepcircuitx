Module name: a25_register_bank.
Module specification: The a25_register_bank module is a hardware unit in a 32-bit RISC design that manages a register bank for data computing and transfers. It supports read and write operations on a wide range of registers (r0 to r15) and can operate on different modes such as user, supervisor, IRQ, and FIQ. The behavior is controlled by a variety of input signals, which represent the mode, selection, and enable operations. The output of the module features the data from the selected register. The module's operation is synchronized with a system-wide clock 'clk' and can be reset using the 'reset' input signal. 

Input ports include clk, reset, scan_enable, test_mode, i_core_stall, i_mem_stall, i_mode_idec, i_mode_exec, i_mode_rds_exec, i_firq_not_user_mode, i_rm_sel, i_rs_sel, i_rn_sel, i_pc_wen, i_reg_bank_wen, i_pc, i_reg, i_wb_read_data, i_wb_read_data_valid, i_wb_read_data_rd, i_wb_mode, i_status_bits_flags, i_status_bits_irq_mask, i_status_bits_firq_mask. These inputs are used for clock signaling, resetting, test modes, stalling operation, command execution modes, register selection, write enable signals, data input, and status flags. 

Output ports include o_rm, o_rs, o_rd, o_rn, o_pc. These ports provide output data of register, read register, written data, next operation data, and program counter. 

Numerous internal signals are used, including the main registers (r0 to r15), special registers for different operation modes (r8_firq to r14_firq, r13_irq, r14_irq, r13_svc, r14_svc), operation selection signals (usr_exec, svc_exec, irq_exec, firq_exec, usr_idec, svc_idec, irq_idec, firq_idec), and write enable signals (read_data_wen, reg_bank_wen_c, pc_wen_c, pc_dmem_wen). 

The module is divided into several conceptual blocks. The signal declaration section declares the registers, input and output ports, and wire elements for internal use. The assignment section creates the relationships between these signals, detailing how they are used in the module's operation. The control logic section with "always" block implements the register operations and transfer mechanism. The final section uses "assign" statements to set the output depending on the register selection and operation mode. Overall, the module facilitates maintainable RTL codes for complex RISC designs.
