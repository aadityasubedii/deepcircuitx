    "spec": "Module name: a25_coprocessor. \n\nModule specification: The a25_coprocessor module is a complex hardware component designed using Verilog RTL, intended to handle cache control and memory management tasks as part of a larger processing system. It uses the ARM architecture, with the functionality to manage cacheable area, updateable area, and disruptive area based on the provided opcodes. In addition, it manages fault status and fault address. The module has several inputs that synchronize operation (clk, reset), inputs for debugging (scan_enable, test_mode), inputs to handle operation halt (i_core_stall), opcode inputs for the coprocessor operations (i_copro_opcode1, i_copro_opcode2), coprocessor operation-specific inputs (i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, i_copro_num), coprocessor operation signal (i_copro_operation) and data to be written to coprocessor (i_copro_write_data) including fault signal and fault details (i_fault, i_fault_status, i_fault_address). The output ports provide the data read from the coprocessor, cache control and cacheable region information (o_copro_read_data, o_cache_enable, o_cache_flush, o_cacheable_area).\n\nThe internal operation involves manipulating various signals based on the inputs like cache_control, cacheable_area, updateable_area, disruptive_area, fault_status, fault_address, copro15_reg1_write, copro_operation_d1, copro_crn_d1. These variables store and handle the cache control signals, the regions of memory that are cacheable, updatable, disruptive, the fault status, and address, and the result of a cache flushing operation. Debugging focused signals latch the values of operation and crn input signals as well.\n\nThe module is divided into sections that handle resetting and processing of each internal signal separately on receiving a clock pulse or a reset signal, a section for determining the cache flushing requirement, and another for generating output data based on the input signals. There's also a separate portion for debugging that only gets included if the A25_COPRO15_DEBUG flag is defined. The debugging section displays the information about various reads and writes happening in the system for each register.",

                    "text": "Module name: a25_coprocessor. \n\nModule specification: The a25_coprocessor module is a complex hardware component designed using Verilog RTL, intended to handle cache control and memory management tasks as part of a larger processing system. It uses the ARM architecture, with the functionality to manage cacheable area, updateable area, and disruptive area based on the provided opcodes. In addition, it manages fault status and fault address. The module has several inputs that synchronize operation (clk, reset), inputs for debugging (scan_enable, test_mode), inputs to handle operation halt (i_core_stall), opcode inputs for the coprocessor operations (i_copro_opcode1, i_copro_opcode2), coprocessor operation-specific inputs (i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, i_copro_num), coprocessor operation signal (i_copro_operation) and data to be written to coprocessor (i_copro_write_data) including fault signal and fault details (i_fault, i_fault_status, i_fault_address). The output ports provide the data read from the coprocessor, cache control and cacheable region information (o_copro_read_data, o_cache_enable, o_cache_flush, o_cacheable_area).\n\nThe internal operation involves manipulating various signals based on the inputs like cache_control, cacheable_area, updateable_area, disruptive_area, fault_status, fault_address, copro15_reg1_write, copro_operation_d1, copro_crn_d1. These variables store and handle the cache control signals, the regions of memory that are cacheable, updatable, disruptive, the fault status, and address, and the result of a cache flushing operation. Debugging focused signals latch the values of operation and crn input signals as well.\n\nThe module is divided into sections that handle resetting and processing of each internal signal separately on receiving a clock pulse or a reset signal, a section for determining the cache flushing requirement, and another for generating output data based on the input signals. There's also a separate portion for debugging that only gets included if the A25_COPRO15_DEBUG flag is defined. The debugging section displays the information about various reads and writes happening in the system for each register."
