    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_coprocessor module handles cache control and memory management tasks within an ARM-based processing system. Key functionality includes managing cacheable, updateable, and disruptive memory areas per opcodes, fault status, and address handling. Inputs control synchronization and provide opcode details, whereas outputs inform on cache control, data read, and cacheable regions. Internal signals map cache control, memory regions, faulting details, cache flushing, and operation debugging. The module processes signals using various blocks, each responsible for a specific task like resetting, processing, output data generation, and debugging."
