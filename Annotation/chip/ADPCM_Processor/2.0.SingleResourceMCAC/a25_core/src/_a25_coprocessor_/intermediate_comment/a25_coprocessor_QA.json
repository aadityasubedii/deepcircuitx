The coprocessor serves to manage cache control, cacheable area, updateable area, and disruptive area based on the opcodes given. It also provides fault status and fault address management. Considering use of codes like copro15_reg1_write and assignments of output like o_cache_flush, the module could be taking care of cache control and memory management tasks as part of the processing system. This module, in combination with others, will facilitate smooth functioning of the overall processing unit. Indications of debug flags further suggest that this module also has provisions for testing in a larger system it is designed for, reflecting potential errors and irregularities during the runtime."

The value is updated on clock's positive edge and reset signal.\n\n2. cacheable_area: This internal register stores the region of memory that is cacheable. The value of this register can be written and read via certain operations conducted by the coprocessor.\n\n3. updateable_area: Just like cacheable_area, this internal register stores the region of memory that is updatable.

Coprocessor operations can update or read this value.\n\n5. fault_status: This register stores the fault status. When a fault signal is received, this register is updated with the incoming fault status and can be later read to identify what fault occurred.\n\n6. fault_address: This register stores the address where the fault occurred. It gets updated with the incoming fault address when a fault signal is received.\n\n7. copro15_reg1_write: This is a wire signal that is turned on when a certain operation (operation 2 on co-processor register 1) is performed and there are no stalls. This signal is used to control cache flushing.\n\n8. copro_operation_d1, copro_crn_d1: These are debugging focused registers that latch the values of operation and crn input signals for the coprocessor when no stalls are present.
