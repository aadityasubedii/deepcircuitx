    "block_comment": "This Verilog block handles the interaction between the core processor and the coprocessor. It uses edge triggered design to achieve synchronous operations with clock, where actions only occur at either rising edge of the clock or reset. When reset happens, the code does nothing and otherwise it checks whether core processor is not in the stall stage. If it is not in stall, performs write or read operation based on the `i_copro_operation` and `copro_operation_d1` control signals. For write operation, it behaves differently for different values of `i_copro_crn` and displays corresponding debug message while modifying the given register values. For read operation, different registers are read based on `copro_crn_d1` values and debug message is displayed correspondingly.\n"
