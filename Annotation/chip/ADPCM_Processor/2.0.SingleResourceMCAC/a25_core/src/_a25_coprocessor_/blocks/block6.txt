This Verilog block of code functions as a fault status and address capture mechanism. On a positive edge of `reset` or `clk`, if `reset` is high, `fault_status` and `fault_address` are reset to 0. However, if `reset` is low and the core is not stalled (`i_core_stall` is low), the fault status and fault address are updated to `i_fault_status` and `i_fault_address` whenever a fault (`i_fault`) occurs. Additionally, if the `A25_COPRO15_DEBUG` compiler directive is defined, the new fault status and address are displayed.
