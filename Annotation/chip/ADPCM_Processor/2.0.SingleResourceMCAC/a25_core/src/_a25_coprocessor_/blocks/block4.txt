Comment: 
This block assigns a value to the `copro15_reg1_write` register. It checks if the core of the processor is not stalled (`!i_core_stall`), and if the coprocessor operation (`i_copro_operation`) is two and the register selected (`i_copro_crn`) is one. These conditions enable `copro15_reg1_write` register. The use of the `&&` operator indicates that all conditions must be met for the assignment to occur. This is implemented with an assign construct in Verilog.
