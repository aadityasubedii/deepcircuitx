This module gets the read data from memory and the corresponding validation signals, and then transfers these to the write-back stage in the processor. If the memory stage is not stalled (i_mem_stall input is not active), it will latch the read data from memory, its validity and the loaded read destination register (i_mem_load_rd). This module also handles the latch of the data address if the memory stage does not stall. These latches are resettable and get reset when a reset signal is given. This module provides the read data to be written back, its validity, the loaded destination register number, and the data address to the next stage."
