    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_write_back module manages write-back operations in a processor pipeline. It latches and transfers read data along with validation signals from the memory stage to the write-back stage when the memory is not stalled. Inputs include clock, reset, memory read data, validation signals, and memory read register details. Internal registers temporarily hold these data and reset during reset operations. Outputs include write-back data, its validation and loaded read register details passed on for write-back operations. The module operation synchronizes with the clock cycles."
