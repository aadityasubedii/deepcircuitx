    "spec": "Module name: a25_write_back.\n\nModule specification: The a25_write_back module facilitates the write-back operation in a processor pipeline system. It receives and validates read data from the memory, latch the data and its associated signals, and transfers them to the write-back stage of the processor. The module operates on the basis of inputs like clk (clock signal) and reset (reset signal), scan_enable, test_mode (design testing signals), i_mem_stall (memory stall status), i_mem_read_data (read data from memory), i_mem_read_data_valid (validation of read data), i_mem_load_rd (read destination register number), i_daddress (data address), and i_daddress_valid (data address validation). \n\nThe internal signals include mem_read_data_r, mem_read_data_valid_r, mem_load_rd_r, and daddress_r that latch the input data if the memory is not stalled and help in synchronizing and validating data during the write-back operation. These signals get reset when a reset signal is raised.\n\nOutput ports o_wb_read_data, o_wb_read_data_valid, and o_wb_load_rd deliver the write-back data, its validity, and write-back destination registers respectively for the write-back operation. \n\nThe code is structured into distinct blocks, each explaining the latching operation for data and its validation, resetting internal signals on reset activation, and the assignment of output ports. The performance of this module and its synchronous operation is ruled by clk (clock signal). The functionality encapsulated ensures the error-free write-back of data in a processor.",

This module gets the read data from memory and the corresponding validation signals, and then transfers these to the write-back stage in the processor. If the memory stage is not stalled (i_mem_stall input is not active), it will latch the read data from memory, its validity and the loaded read destination register (i_mem_load_rd). This module also handles the latch of the data address if the memory stage does not stall. These latches are resettable and get reset when a reset signal is given. This module provides the read data to be written back, its validity, the loaded destination register number, and the data address to the next stage."

If not, the module captures the incoming data.\n5. i_mem_read_data: This is the 32-bit data read from memory fed into this module.\n6. i_mem_read_data_valid: This input signal validates whether read data from memory is correct or not.\n7. i_mem_load_rd: This is the loaded read destination register number from the memory stage.\n8. i_daddress: This is the loaded data address from the memory stage.\n9. i_daddress_valid: This signal validates the loaded data address.\n\nExplanation: clk and reset are common signals that all digital logic modules will have to ensure synchronous operation. i_mem_stall, i_mem_read_data, i_mem_read_data_valid, and i_mem_load_rd are inputs passed from the memory stage of the processor for the write-back operation. i_daddress and i_daddress_valid are inputs regarding the address of the data to be written back.\n\nOutput ports:\n1. o_wb_read_data: This is the output data that is ready to be written back.\n2. o_wb_read_data_valid: This is the output signal indicating whether the write-back data is valid or not.\n3. o_wb_load_rd: This is the output loaded read destination register number, ready for the write-back operation.\n \nExplanation: All the output ports (o_wb_read_data, o_wb_read_data_valid, o_wb_load_rd) are the signals passed to the write-back stage of the processor.
