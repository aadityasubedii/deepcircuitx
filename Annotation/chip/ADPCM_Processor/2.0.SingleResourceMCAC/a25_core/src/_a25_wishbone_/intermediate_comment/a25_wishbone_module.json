    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_wishbone module serves as a multi-port interface for the Wishbone bus system, managing traffic via a first-come-first-served policy. It processes requests via three ports, each associated with a buffer instance (a25_wishbone_buf). The 'new_access' signal triggers data acceptance from valid buffers and determines which operation (read or write) should be performed. Along with the internal wire arrays and registers, this mechanism ensures efficient data transfer to/from the Wishbone bus."
