It supports three different ports for data transmission, each port includes request, acknowledgement, write-data input, write enable input, address input, read-data output, byte enable input, and so on. Each port is connected to a buffer (a25_wishbone_buf) that is responsible for handling requests from the port. It coordinates when to accept new data from the connected buffers. This module also determines which buffer to get data from and transfer it to the wishbone bus based on a first-come-first-served policy. Therefore, the module helps to handle and control the traffic for multi-port access to a common wishbone bus."
