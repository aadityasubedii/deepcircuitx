Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple ways and handling read/write operations, cache misses, and exclusive accesses. It uses tag and data memories, a finite state machine for control, and implements cache line replacement strategies. The cache is designed with configurable parameters for size, line size, and number of ways, allowing flexibility in processor implementations. It manages cache initialization, hit detection, write-back mechanisms, and interfaces with the processor and memory system.
