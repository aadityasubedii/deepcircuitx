Module name: a25_dcache. Module specification: This module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple ways (2, 3, 4, or 8) and handling read/write operations, cache misses, and exclusive accesses. It features input ports for clock, reset, request signals, address, write data, and memory interface, along with output ports for read data, stall signals, and memory requests. Internal signals manage cache state, tag/data storage, hit detection, and replacement strategies. The module is organized into several blocks: cache initialization, tag/data memory access, hit detection, cache line replacement, write-back mechanism, and exclusive access handling. It uses a finite state machine to control cache operations, including idle, fill, write-hit, and exclusive delete states. The cache is designed with configurable parameters for cache size, line size, and number of ways, allowing flexibility in different processor implementations. The module emplo
