    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to report an error message when multiple cache hits are detected. On the rising edge of either reset or the clock signal, if the sum of hits in the three defined cache ways is greater than 1, the code will invoke a testbench (TB) error message and print \"Hit in more than one cache ways!\" to the display. The reset signal is checked first ensuring the code block doesn't execute while system reset is active.\n"
