    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the \"exclusive_access\" signal based on the logical AND operation of two inputs: \"i_exclusive\" and \"i_cache_enable\". This indicates that exclusive access to a resource or operation is granted only when both the exclusive request signal (\"i_exclusive\") and cache control signal (\"i_cache_enable\") are asserted. Therefore, execution or control flow in subsequent circuits or modules that rely on this \"exclusive_access\" signal will be determined by the combined state of \"i_exclusive\" and \"i_cache_enable\"."
