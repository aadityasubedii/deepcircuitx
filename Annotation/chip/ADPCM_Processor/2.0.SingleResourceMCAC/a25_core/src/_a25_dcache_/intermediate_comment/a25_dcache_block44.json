    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling word alignment in memory write operations. It makes use of the 'assign' keyword with a conditional operator to determine how the write operation proceeds. The block uses the 'i_byte_enable' variable to determine which bytes to contribute to the 'con_write_data_word' and from which source, either 'i_write_data' or 'con_read_data_word'. For instance, when 'i_byte_enable' is '4'b0001', the least significant byte of 'i_write_data' is written, with the remaining bytes composed from 'con_read_data_word'. When 'i_byte_enable' is '4'b0010', the second least significant byte is written from 'i_write_data' and the rest are composed from 'con_read_data_word' and 'i_write_data'. This pattern continues to handle all cases for 4-bit combinations of 'i_byte_enable'."
