    "block_comment": "This block is a Verilog function named 'pick_way' designed to provide a way to select a valid position from a given set of bits. The function takes as input a set of valid bits and a random number, and then returning a single bit of a 8-bit wide output. It examines the valid bits sequentially from bit 0 to bit 7, and when it finds an invalid bit (represent by '0'), it returns a 8-bit output where only the corresponding bit position is '1', all the others are '0'. If all bits in valid_bits are valid (represent by '1'), the function uses the 3 most significant bits of the random number to select a specific output."
