    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the write enable signals for a cache way. If the cache way is selected from a source fill operation, write hit condition or during a consecutive write, a flag will be set to allow data write into the selected cache way. These conditions are checked through a series of logical AND and OR operations involving various control and status signals related to cache state, data hits, and source fill operations."
