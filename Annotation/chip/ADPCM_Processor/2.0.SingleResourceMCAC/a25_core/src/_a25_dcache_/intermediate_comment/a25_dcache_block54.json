    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the state of exclusive read-hit flag and its associated cache hit way in case of an exclusive access cache hit, clearing, or complete cache fill scenarios. Upon a positive edge of reset or clock, the values of 'ex_read_hit_r' and 'ex_read_hit_way' are initially set to 0. However, if the reset is not active and 'ex_read_hit_clear' is enabled, both are again reset to 0. In case an exclusive read hit is detected, they are set to 1 and 'data_hit_way' respectively, where possible debug information is displayed. Lastly, if cache fill is completed and an exclusive read hit flag is invoked, 'ex_read_hit_way' is updated to 'select_way'."
