    "block_comment": "This block implements a simple logic for data hit way tracking with a reset and clock prompt. When a reset signal is encountered, the data_hit_way_r is reset to zero. However, when a write_hit signal is encountered (without the presence of a reset signal), the data_hit_way_r value is updated to the current value of data_hit_way. The module is edge-triggered, responding to the rising edges of the reset and clock inputs."
