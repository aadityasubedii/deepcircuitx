    "block_comment": "The block of code serves as a synchronous reset and data update operation depending on control signals. It is clock-sensitive, and operation is triggered by a rising-edge clock signal or a reset command. If a reset signal is received, the `valid_bits_r` is reset to zero. If no reset signal is received, the value of `valid_bits_r` is updated on the rising edge of the clk signal if the state machine (`c_state`) is idle (`CS_IDLE`), and simultaneously accumulates the top value of the tags (`tag_rdata_way[x][TAG_WIDTH-1]`) for each specific way in a set-associative data cache from 0 to 7 ways. The concatenation operator `{}` is used to form `valid_bits_r` from the highest valid bit of each entry in the cache."
