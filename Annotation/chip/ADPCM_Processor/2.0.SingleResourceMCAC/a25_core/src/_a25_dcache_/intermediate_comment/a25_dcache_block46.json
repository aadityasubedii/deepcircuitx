    "block_comment": "This block of code performs conditional write operations on the elements of a data array based on specific address pointers. Based on the slice i_address[3:2], varying amounts of existing data array (data_wdata_r) are preserved while the rest are replaced with the content of con_write_data_word. If i_address[3:2] == 2'd0, the value of con_write_data_word replaces the last 32 bits of data_wdata_r, while the rest of the elements remain the same. Similarly, for i_address[3:2] equal to 2'd1, 2'd2, and others, different segments of data_wdata_r are replaced while preserving the remaining unchanged."
