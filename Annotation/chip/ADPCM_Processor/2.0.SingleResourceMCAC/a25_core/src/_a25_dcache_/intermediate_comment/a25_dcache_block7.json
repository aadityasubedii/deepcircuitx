    "block_comment": "This block of code, `check_hit_3ways`, is designed to handle the condition when the number of ways (or possible directions for data flow in a multi-level cache scenario) equals three. The code block does this by initiating a subsection (begin-end block) only if the parameter `WAYS` has a value of 3. The actual details of how the data direction is handled are included within this block. Any commands, algorithms, or logic used within this code block are employed only under the specific condition where `WAYS == 3`, thereby controlling the functionality based on the organization of the cache memory."
