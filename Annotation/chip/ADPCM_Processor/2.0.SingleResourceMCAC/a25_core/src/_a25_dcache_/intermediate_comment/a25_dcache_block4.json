    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a conditional element that is activated when the value of 'WAYS' equals to 8. The block is named 'check_hit_8ways', indicating that its implementation likely relates to a hit-check mechanism within an 8-way set associative cache design. The actual details of this implementation are not visible in this isolated snippet and would be contained within the body of this conditional statement."
