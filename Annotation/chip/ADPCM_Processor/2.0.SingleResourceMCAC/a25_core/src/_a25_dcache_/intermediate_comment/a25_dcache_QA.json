It supports multiple ways (2, 3, 4, or 8) and is designed to handle read and write operations, cache misses, and exclusive accesses. The cache manages tag and data storage, implements cache line replacement strategies, and interfaces with the processor and memory system. It includes features like cache flushing, write-back mechanisms, and handling of exclusive memory accesses. The module is designed to be configurable in terms of cache size, line size, and number of ways, allowing for flexibility in different processor implementations."
