    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code aims to determine the next way to choose based on the current state of `valid_bits_r` and a randomly generated number `random_num`. The main action happens in the `pick_way` function when the number of ways (`WAYS`) is equal to 4. The function `pick_way` takes as its arguments `valid_bits_r`, representing the current state of the system, and 'random_num' - a randomly generated number, which is utilized for decision-making in the implementation. The resulting way is then assigned to `next_way`, setting up the path for the following operations."
