    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code handles the update of the variable `miss_address` based on system reset and cache conditions. In implementation, it uses an always block that triggers at the positive edges of the `reset` and `clk` signals. If the `reset` signal is high, it initializes `miss_address` to 0. Otherwise, the block checks if a write-Back cache request (`o_wb_cached_req`) is initiated, or there's a `write_hit`. Under these conditions, `miss_address` gets updated with the incoming address (`i_address`)."
