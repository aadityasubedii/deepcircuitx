    "block_comment": "The block of code is a write-enable signal assignment for a specific way in a cache memory architecture in Verilog. By employing logical OR operation between the 'select_way' array at index i and the 'source_sel' array at predefined C_INIT index, coupled with the logical AND operation with 'tag_wenable', the block generates the signal 'tag_wenable_way[i]' which controls whether the tag at way[i] could be written or not."
