    "block_comment": "This function block chooses a way based on the input of valid bits and a random number. The valid bits entered are checked serially, and if a zero is encountered, the function assigns that position in a 4-bit binary form. However, if all valid bits are ones, the function uses the higher three bits of the random number to decide the output. According to the value of these bits (0 to 2, 3, 4 to 5, or otherwise), it assigns a respective 4-bit binary pattern."
