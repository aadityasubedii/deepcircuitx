    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a finite state machine (FSM) for cache control. The states of the FSM include idle, initialization, fill, complete fill, turnaround, write hit and miss, among others. If the system reset or a cache flush operation is used, the cache state is reset or initialized accordingly, and certain default values are set. Upon each clock cycle, based on the current state of the cache and other trigger conditions such as read and write hits or misses, the FSM transits to a new state. The cache state transitions dictate the cache control's behaviour such as selecting the source, updating the count for initialization, and generating randomness. Any debug messages related to the cache operations are displayed conditionally when `A25_CACHE_DEBUG` is defined."
