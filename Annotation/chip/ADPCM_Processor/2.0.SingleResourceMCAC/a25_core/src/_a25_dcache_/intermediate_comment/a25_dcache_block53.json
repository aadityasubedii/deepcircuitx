    "block_comment": "This block of given Verilog code implements a mechanism to track and update the `ex_read_address` register. The `ex_read_address` register is sensitive to a positive edge of the `reset` or the `clk` signal. If the `reset` signal is active, `ex_read_address` is reset to 0. On the other hand, in the absence of a `reset` signal, and when there is a hit in the cache (`ex_read_hit` is true), `ex_read_address` is set to the address input from the upper cache (obtained by slicing the `i_address` for cache address width between `CACHE_ADDR32_MSB` and `CACHE_ADDR32_LSB`). This manages read address in the case where cache data fetch resulted in a hit."
