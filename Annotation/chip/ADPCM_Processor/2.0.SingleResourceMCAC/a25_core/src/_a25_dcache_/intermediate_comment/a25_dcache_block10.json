    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially doing state enumeration for a state machine in a Verilog design. It assigns the string name equivalent of the various states to the variable xC_STATE, based on the value of the c_state variable. Using a conditional (ternary) operator, the block checks for equality with various predefined states (CS_INIT, CS_IDLE, CS_FILL, etc.). Dependent on which state is true, it will assign the corresponding string representation to the xC_STATE. If none of the conditions are met, it defaults to \"UNKNOWN\"."
