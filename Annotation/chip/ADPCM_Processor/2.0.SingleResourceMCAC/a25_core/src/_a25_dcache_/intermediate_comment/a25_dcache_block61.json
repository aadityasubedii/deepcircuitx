    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is utilized to detect whether a consecutive write action is required or not. It does this by comparing the high bits of the miss_address with the incoming address (i_address) along with validating if the write action is enabled, if the cache state is in write hit mode, and checking if a request pulse is currently occurring. This will enable the hardware model to perform consecutive writes in the write hit cache state, improving memory operation efficiency."
