    "block_comment": "This block of code is a safety checker for the cache hit in a multicore processor architecture. Upon a rising edge of the clock or a reset signal, the always loop is triggered. If there's a reset, no operations are performed but if there isn't, the loop checks for simultaneous cache hits across all eight ways of the cache. If the summation of all hits is more than one (4'd1), it throws an error message indicating \"Hit in more than one cache ways.\" This mechanism ensures the data integrity of the system by restricting multiple cache hits from happening simultaneously."
