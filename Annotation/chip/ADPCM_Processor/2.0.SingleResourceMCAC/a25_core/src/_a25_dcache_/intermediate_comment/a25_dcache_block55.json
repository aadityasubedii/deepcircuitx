    "block_comment": "The block of code is designed to generate a signal, ex_read_hit_clear, that indicates a read-hit clear event in the EX stage of a pipeline. This is achieved by setting ex_read_hit_clear to true when the control state equals CS_EX_DELETE, implying that the EX_DELETE state is currently active. This is essentially checking the state of a control machine and acting accordingly."
