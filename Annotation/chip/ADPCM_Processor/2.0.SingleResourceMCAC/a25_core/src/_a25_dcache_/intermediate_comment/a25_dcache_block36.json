    "block_comment": "The block of code is used for detecting read miss conditions in a cache memory design. The read miss happens when there is a hold on the request, and it's not an idle hit or a write operation. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements that utilise combinational logic to assign the Boolean result of the RHS (Right Hand Side) of the equation to the LHS (Left Hand Side). Therefore, the read_miss output is asserted whenever the conditions on the RHS are met, indicating a cache read miss."
