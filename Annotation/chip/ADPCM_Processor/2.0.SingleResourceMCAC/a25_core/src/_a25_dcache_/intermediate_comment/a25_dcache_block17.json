    "block_comment": "This function block selects a way ('pick_way') based on incoming valid bits ('valid_bits') and a random number ('random_num'). By checking if the individual bits in the valid_bits are 0, the function sets the corresponding bit in pick_way. If all bits in valid_bits are 1, the function uses a switch-case on the 3 highest bits of random_num to decide the pick_way. If random_num is between 0 to 2, it sets the middle bit in pick_way, if it's between 2 to 4, the third bit is set. For all other cases, the first bit is set in pick_way."
