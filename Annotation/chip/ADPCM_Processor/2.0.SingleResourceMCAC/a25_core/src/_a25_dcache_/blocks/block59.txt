This block of code is for defining `fill_state` status signal in a digital system. It achieves this by using the Verilog `assign` statement, which continuously assigns the value of the expression on the right (i.e., `c_state == CS_FILL`) to the target on the left (`fill_state`). This essentially means that `fill_state` is 'true' or 'high' whenever `c_state` equals `CS_FILL`, representing that the system is in a 'fill' state.
