Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls the write enable signal for a tag memory block (tag_wenable). It does so by using a conditional (ternary) operator to evaluate certain conditions. If the InvA source is selected (source_sel[C_INVA]), Fill source is selected (source_sel[C_FILL]), or Init source is selected (source_sel[C_INIT]) are true, tag_wenable is enabled (set to 1). On the other hand, if the Core source is selected (source_sel[C_CORE]) or none of the conditions are met, tag_wenable is disabled (set to 0).
