This block generates multiple SRAMs for tag and data, designed to operate as part of a cache controller. It creates 'WAY' number of SRAMs where 'WAY' is a parameter. Based on the 'verilog' define, it either uses `generic_sram_line_en_256x21` and `generic_sram_byte_en_256x8` or `generic_sram_line_en` and `generic_sram_byte_en`. Signals for tag and data write enable for each SRAM are determined through logic conditions. It uniquely assigns addresses and checks conditions for a data hit for each way. The data hit check includes validating the tag and comparing the requested address with the stored address when in an idle state.
