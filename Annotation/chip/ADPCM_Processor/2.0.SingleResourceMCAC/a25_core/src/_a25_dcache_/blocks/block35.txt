Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for identifying a read occurrence during exclusive access when the system is not on write mode and idle hit is true. This is implemented using an 'assign' statement which performs bitwise operations on binary signals 'exclusive_access', 'i_write_enable' and 'idle_hit'. it ensures that 'ex_read_hit' is true only when there is exclusive access, no write enable, and an idle hit.
