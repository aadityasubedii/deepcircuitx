Comment: 
This block is responsible for assigning data read from the write-back burst to a variable (read_miss_wdata). It does this using Verilog's 'assign' keyword, which assigns the value of the right-hand-side expression (wb_rdata_burst) to the left-hand-side wire (read_miss_wdata) when the right-hand-side expression changes.
