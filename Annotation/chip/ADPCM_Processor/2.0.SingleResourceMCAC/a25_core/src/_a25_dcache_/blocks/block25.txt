Comment: 
This block initializes and manages the valid_bits_r register. Upon the rise of either the 'reset' or 'clk' signals, this always block is triggered. If the reset signal is high, the valid_bits_r is reset to 0. However, in normal operation when reset is not high (else section), if the control state (c_state) is in idle state (CS_IDLE), the latest valid bits from the tag read data (tag_rdata_way) for the three ways 0, 1, and 2 are loaded into the valid_bits_r register. This operation is performed on the high clock or high reset edges.
