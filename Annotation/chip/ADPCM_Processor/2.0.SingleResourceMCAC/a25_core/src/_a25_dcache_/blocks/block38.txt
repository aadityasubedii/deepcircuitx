Comment: 
The block is responsible for initiating a write operation on receiving a write request. It accomplishes this by using the 'assign' Verilog statement to create a combinational logic binding. The 'write_hit' is set to true when all conditions 'request_hold', 'i_write_enable', and 'idle_hit' are met, indicating that a write request is held, write permission is enabled, and there's no ongoing task that could potentially interfere with the write operation.
