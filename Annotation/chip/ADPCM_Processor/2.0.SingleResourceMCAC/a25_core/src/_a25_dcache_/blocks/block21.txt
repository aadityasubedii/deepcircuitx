This block is used to assign the read data from a cache "hit" depending upon the number of ways (WAYS) in the cache. The block achieves this functionality by using conditional (ternary) operators for conditional assignment. Specifically, for each number of ways (from 2 to 8), it checks `data_hit_way` for each possible way. If a hit is found, it assigns the corresponding `data_rdata_way` to `hit_rdata`. In the case that there is no hit, `hit_rdata` is assigned a value of 1, replicated CACHE_LINE_WIDTH times.
