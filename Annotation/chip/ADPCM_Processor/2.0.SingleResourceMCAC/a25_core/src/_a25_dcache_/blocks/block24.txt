Comment: 
Without the actual verilog code, it's impossible to generate a comment. However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding here. It seems you're asking for the process and methodology to create and structure the data for an AI model rather than the manual creation of a comment. To train a language model for comment generation on Verilog RTL codes, you would proceed with the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect a large amount of Verilog RTL codebase, both for training and validation. Make sure they are of high quality and cover various aspects of Verilog design (logic, arithmetic, memory, state machines, etc). Each block of code should have associated comments explaining the functionality and implementation details.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the codebase, by removing irrelevant information, standardizing the tabulation, indentation, braces formatting, etc. Also, sanitize the comments, removing unnecessary or irrelevant parts, standardizing the active/passive voice, removing spelling mistakes or non-technical jargon.

3. **Data Segregation**: Each data row would consist of one block of Verilog code (input) and the corresponding comment (output). Depending upon the size and complexity of your language model, you may choose to provide the whole program in the input or only the block currently being explained.

4. **Data Formatting**: Convert code and comments into token sequences considering the right vocabulary (Verilog keywords, hardware terms, comment-specific language words, etc). For code, create an additional sequence representing the syntax structure, using something like a tree traversal sequence or transformational sequence of the code.

Following these steps will allow you to have your raw data processed into a form suitable for training the model for comment generation for Verilog RTL codes.
