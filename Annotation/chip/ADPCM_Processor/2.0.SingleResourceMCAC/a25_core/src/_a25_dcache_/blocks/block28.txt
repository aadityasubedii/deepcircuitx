The code block assigns the `data_hit_way[i]` logic output based on certain conditions. `data_hit_way[i]` represents whether the addressed data is found in a particular cache way. There are multiple conditions to satisfy for a hit: first, the tag stored in `tag_rdata_way[i]` from the cache must be valid by checking the final bit; second, the tag must equal the extracted tag from the input address `i_address`; third, the cache state `c_state` must be idle (`CS_IDLE`). All these conditions are covered using logical AND operations.
