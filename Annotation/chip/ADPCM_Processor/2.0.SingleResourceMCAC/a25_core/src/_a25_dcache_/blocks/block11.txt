Comment: 
The block is responsible for assignment of source selection based on the high priority signal. The implementation is comprised of a multi-way conditional selection of source signals with priority order from `C_CORE` to `C_INVA`. If none of the source signals is high, `UNKNOWN` will be given as the default selection.
