Comment: 
This block initializes and updates a data write buffer in a synchronous system. It's triggered at either the rising edge of reset or clock. When a reset signal is received, it clears the data write buffer by setting 'data_wdata_r' to 0. During normal operation (no reset), 'data_wdata_r' is updated with the 'data_wdata' value if either a write hit or a consecutive write condition is met.
