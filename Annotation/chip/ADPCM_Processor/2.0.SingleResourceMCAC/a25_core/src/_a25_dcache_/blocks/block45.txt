This block deals with the assignment of read data words based on the two least significant bits of the provided address. Depending on the value of bits 3 to 2 of the 'i_address', it selects a specific 32-bit word from the 128-bit 'data_wdata_r' register and assigns it to 'con_read_data_word'. If 'i_address[3:2]' is '2'd0', '2'd1', and '2'd2', it produces the first, second, and third 32-bit word of 'data_wdata_r', respectively. For all other cases, it defaults to producing the fourth 32-bit word of 'data_wdata_r'.
