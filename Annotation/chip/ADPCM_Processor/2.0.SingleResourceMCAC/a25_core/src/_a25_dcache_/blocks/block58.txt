This module block is responsible for generating a signal indicating a write buffer hit. The `wb_hit` signal is assigned an assertion based on the evaluation of a few conditions. Firstly, it checks if the input address `i_address` matches the buffer address `wb_address`. Then, it confirms whether the `i_wb_cached_ready` signal is high, suggesting the write buffer is ready. Finally, it evaluates if the `fill_state` signal is high or active, typically indicating the write buffer fill stage.
