This block of code acts as an error handling mechanism, it ensures that a correct value for the DCACHE configuration is specified during the setting up of a cache system. If the number of cache ways provided is unsupported, an error message is displayed. It achieves this by an initial block that prints an error message upon initialization if an incorrect value of `WAYS` is detected. This process is part of the behavioral description of the RTL code, aiming to prevent incorrect cache configuration.
