Comment: 
This line of code assigns the state of an exclusive read cache operation. If an exclusive access request is active, write enable is off, and the cache system state is not idle, the `ex_read_cache_busy` signal will be asserted indicating that the operation is in progress. In this case, the implementation leverages basic logical operators to control the state of the `ex_read_cache_busy` based on the conditions of other signals and states in the system.
