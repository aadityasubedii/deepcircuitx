Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is primarily responsible for selective data write operations based on address inputs. The implementation relies on the bitwise selection of the address field `i_address[3:2]` and updates the `write_hit_wdata` variable accordingly by concatenating the write data ('write_data_word') into a specific part of retrieved hit data ('hit_rdata'). Depending on the address segment value, the block substitutes a 32-bit data piece with 'write_data_word' at the corresponding segment position in 'hit_rdata' and keeps the rest of 'hit_rdata' intact.
