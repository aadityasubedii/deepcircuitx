The block of code takes care of assigning the tag address based on the selection signals from the cache controller. If CACHE_FILL signal is selected, the 'miss_address' value is chosen from a certain range of bits, if CACHE_INVA is selected, the 'ex_read_address' is chosen. If CACHE_INIT is selected, the 'init_count' ranging from CACHE_ADDR_WIDTH-1 to 0 is selected and on selection of CACHE_CORE signal, 'address' value is used. If none are selected, a value of zeros with a size equal to CACHE_ADDR_WIDTH is assigned.
