This block assigns the data_address based on certain conditions. It uses a ternary operator to set the value of data_address. If the consecutive_write condition is true, it assigns the miss_address between CACHE_ADDR32_MSB and CACHE_ADDR32_LSB to data_address. If not and if the write_hit condition is true, it assigns the i_address between CACHE_ADDR32_MSB and CACHE_ADDR32_LSB to data_address. If neither is true, it checks if source_sel[C_FILL] or source_sel[C_CORE] is true, and if so, assigns miss_address or address respectively. If none of these conditions are met, it assigns a zero-filled bit vector to data_address.
