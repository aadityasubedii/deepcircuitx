Comment: 
The pick_way_3ways block in this Verilog code is designed to select a specific way or direction based on the valid bits and a random number. The assignment operation within this block executes the pick_way function with valid_bits_r and random_num as arguments, which extracts a new direction for the flow based on the present validity bits and a role of randomness to ensure unpredictability.
