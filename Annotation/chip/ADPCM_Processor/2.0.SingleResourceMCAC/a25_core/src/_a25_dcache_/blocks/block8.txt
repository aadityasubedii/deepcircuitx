This block of code is responsible for checking cache hits in a system. The implementation utilizes two significant clock edges, `reset` and `clk`. Here, when reset is asserted, it clears the previous state conforming to the typical reset function. Otherwise, when the clock signal is received, it checks if the summation of `data_hit_way[0]` and `data_hit_way[1]` is greater than one implying that there are hits in more than one cache way. If such occurrence is detected, it triggers an error by displaying a message "Hit in more than one cache ways!".
