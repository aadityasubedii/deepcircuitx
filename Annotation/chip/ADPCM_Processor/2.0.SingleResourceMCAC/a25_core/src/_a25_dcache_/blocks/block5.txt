This block of Verilog RTL handles cache interrogation in a system with a multi-way cache organization. The logic is clocked on the rising edge of the system's reset or clock signals. The block handles an abnormal condition where a 'data hit' - a successful cache interrogation - occurs in multiple ways of the cache hardware. If a hit occurs in more than one cache way, indicating a data redundancy or cache config issue, an error message "Hit in more than one cache ways!" is triggered.
