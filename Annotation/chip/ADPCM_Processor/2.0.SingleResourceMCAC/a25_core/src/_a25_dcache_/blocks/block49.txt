Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code handles the data write operation in different control states. If a write operation hits the targeted register and the control state machine (c_state) is in idle state (CS_IDLE), the 'data_wdata' gets the 'write_hit_wdata'. If there's a consecutive write operation, the 'data_wdata' gets the 'consecutive_write_wdata'. In cases where the write operation encounters a read miss, the 'data_wdata' gets the 'read_miss_wdata'. This conditional assignment helps ensure efficient handling of data writes under varying system conditions.
