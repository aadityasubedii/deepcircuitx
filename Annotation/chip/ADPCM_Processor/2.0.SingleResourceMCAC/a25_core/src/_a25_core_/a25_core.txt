Module-level comment: The 'a25_core' is the top-level module for an A25 processor, encapsulating the main stages of instruction execution. It uses various sub-modules, namely 'a25_fetch', 'a25_decode', 'a25_execute', 'a25_mem', 'a25_write_back', 'a25_wishbone', and 'a25_coprocessor', to perform instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory management, write-back, data interchange and specific computational tasks. The module utilizes a range of input/output ports and internal signals for communicating between sub-modules, maintaining flow control, handling exceptions and supporting memory operations. This design follows the RISC architecture pipeline mechanism to ensure high instruction throughput and reduced cycle latency.
