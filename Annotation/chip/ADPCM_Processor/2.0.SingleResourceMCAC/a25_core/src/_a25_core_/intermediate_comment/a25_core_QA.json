It includes inputs like clock and reset signals, signals related to test and assignments of the hardware design. This module includes 5 sub-modules namely a25_fetch, a25_decode, a25_execute, a25_mem, a25_write_back, a25_wishbone, and a25_coprocessor. These sub-modules symbolize the major stages of instruction execution in a processor: instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory and write back. Additionally, a Wishbone interface for data interchange and a co-processor for specific computational tasks are included. Input and output ports between these sub-modules are also well defined. This design follows a classic RISC pipeline architecture which maximizes instruction throughput and minimizes cycle latency."
