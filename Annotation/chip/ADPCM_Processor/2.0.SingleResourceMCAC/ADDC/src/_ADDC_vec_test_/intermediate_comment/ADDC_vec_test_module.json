    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module is a comprehensive testbench that validates the 'ADDC' module's operations. By initializing critical testing parameters, like rates, laws, operations, types, models, etc., it runs exhaustive testing iterations using a nested loop structure. Test vectors are read from external files which are validated against outputs like DQ, SEZ, PK0 and SIGPK. Discrepancies are flagged using error signals, providing key insights into ADDC's performance, thus aiding in verification and debugging."
