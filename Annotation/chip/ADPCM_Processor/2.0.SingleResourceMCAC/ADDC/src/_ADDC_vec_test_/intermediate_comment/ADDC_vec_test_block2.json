    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog code block primarily functions as an assertion check or error identification system during the simulation of a hardware design. It compares the expected results (PK0s[j] and SIGPKs[j]) against the actual results (PK0 and SIGPK) respectively. When disagreement is observed, meaning the test failed, the block reports the discrepancy via the $display system task that provides detailed information about the error. The relevant parameters including model, rate, law, type, operation, DQ and SEZ are printed for debugging purposes. Furthermore, if ERRORSTOP is defined, the $stop system task is invoked to halt the simulation at the point where the error is detected."
