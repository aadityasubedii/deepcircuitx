    "block_comment": "This block of code performs the testing routine for a Recursive Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) model. This routine outputs test vectors and compares the produced values of DQ, SEZ, PK0, and SIGPK with expected results. It proceeds by iterating over a set of operations, types, and laws loaded from memory, skipping over the case where model==0 and type==1. Error checking takes place for each single test vector, reporting when a obtained DQ, SEZ, PK0, or SIGPK value does not match the expected one, based on the corresponding vectorSize. It optionally offers verbose output and immediate test termination at the first failed test. The output provides specifics on the failing cases for easy debugging."
