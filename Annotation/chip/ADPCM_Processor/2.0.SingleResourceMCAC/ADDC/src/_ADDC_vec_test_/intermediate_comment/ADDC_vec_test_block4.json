    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code reads data from memory into various structures. It uses the `$readmemh` system function to read hexadecimal data from a series of text files into the corresponding arrays / registers: `vectorSizes`, `DQs`, `SEZs`, `PK0s`, and `SIGPKs`. The paths to these files are created by concatenating a static base path with variables for different parameters `laws`, `models`, `types`, `operations`, and `rates`. This allows for a flexible way of getting different data sets based on different configurations."
