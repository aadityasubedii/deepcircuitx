    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the oscillation of the clock signal. It uses an 'always' block that is triggered every half period (`CLK_PERIOD/2`) of the defined clock cycle. When triggered, it inverts the existing clock signal (`clk = ~clk;`), effectively creating a square wave with a frequency of one over the set `CLK_PERIOD`. This simulated clock signal can be utilized in further synchronous processes in the Verilog code."
