This block of code serves as a termination protocol for a Verilog testbench. It introduces a delay of 10 time units, after which it calls the $display function to output the message - "%t TEST COMPLETE", where "%t" is replaced with the current simulation time returned by $time. Following this, the $finish task is invoked to end the simulation run entirely.
