This Verilog block runs nested for-loops with conditional read and display operations, leading to a test-driven design setup. The code enumerates multiple system configs using different models, operations, types, and laws. It reads several vector parameters from memory according to these parameters and iterates through the vectors. At each step, it compares the test's output parameters (DQ, SEZ, PK0, SIGPK) against expected values and records any inconsistencies. It also includes configurable verbosity and stop-on-error controls that can be set during the simulation setup.
