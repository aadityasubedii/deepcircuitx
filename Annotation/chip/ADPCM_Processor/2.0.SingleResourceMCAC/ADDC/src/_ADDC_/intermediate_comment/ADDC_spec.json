    "spec": "Module Name: ADDC. \n\nModule Specification: \nThe ADDC (Adder with carry) module performs operations with two inputs DQ and SEZ, which are 16-bit and 15-bit vectors, respectively, to provide two outputs PK0 and SIGPK depending on the conditions. \n\nThe module has specific inputs including reset, and clk serving the reset and clock signal purpose respectively. Test signals such as scan_in0 to scan_in4 and scan_enable are used for testing the module, and test_mode helps in transitioning to test conditions. \n\nThe module outputs consist of PK0, which is determined by the most significant bit from the sum of processed vectors, and SIGPK which is a flag set based on the sum comparison to zero. Scan outputs from scan_out0 to scan_out4 are used for diagnostic and testing. \n\nInternally, signals like DQS, DQI, SEZS, SEZI, and DQSEZ are used. DQS is used for snagging the last bit of DQ and DQI relies on DQS comparison with zero. Similarly, SEZS gets the last bit of SEZ, and SEZI is determined by the comparison of SEZS with zero. DQSEZ holds the sum of DQI and SEZI. \n\nThe module works in stages, with initial stages for assigning values to internal signals DQS, DQI, SEZS, SEZI based on checks and operations applied to the inputs. The next stage performs the addition operation to yield DQSEZ. The final stage assigns PK0 depending upon the most significant bit from the computed sum (DQSEZ) and compares the computed sum to zero to output SIGPK. Thus, the module works as an organized ADDC processor performing the addition operation with intermediate bitwise manipulations and checks.",

It takes two inputs - DQ and SEZ - which are 16-bit and 15-bit vectors respectively. Depending on the most significant bits of both inputs, it does some operations with those inputs. DQS is assigned the value of the last bit of DQ input and DQI is determined based on the equality comparison of DQS with zero. Similarly, the last bit of SEZ input is assigned to SEZS and the SEZI is determined based on this SEZS value. After processing, these two new resulting vectors (DQI and SEZI) are added together to yield DQSEZ. The most significant bit of this sum is assigned to PK0 and the overall sum of vectors is checked for zero and assigned to output SIGPK."

DQ: A 16-bit vector input to the ADDC module.\n7. SEZ: A 15-bit vector input to the ADDC module.\n\nExplanation: The bit-wise signals are used for different operations in the ADDC module, such as determining the value of DQI and SEZI, and then using these values to compute the sum, DQSEZ. The testing signals help configure the module into specific states for the purpose of carrying out debug and test operations.\n\nOutput Ports:\n1. scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4: These outputs are often used for diagnostic or testing purposes.\n2.

The diagnostic signals provide module state information helpful during debug and test operations."
