It takes two inputs - DQ and SEZ - which are 16-bit and 15-bit vectors respectively. Depending on the most significant bits of both inputs, it does some operations with those inputs. DQS is assigned the value of the last bit of DQ input and DQI is determined based on the equality comparison of DQS with zero. Similarly, the last bit of SEZ input is assigned to SEZS and the SEZI is determined based on this SEZS value. After processing, these two new resulting vectors (DQI and SEZI) are added together to yield DQSEZ. The most significant bit of this sum is assigned to PK0 and the overall sum of vectors is checked for zero and assigned to output SIGPK."
