Module-level Comment: The ADDC module performs an addition operation with the inputs DQ and SEZ, which are processed based on their most significant bits. For this, internal signals DQS, DQI, SEZS, and SEZI are manipulated and computed. The final sum, DQSEZ, is used to determine the outputs PK0 and SIGPK. PK0 is the most significant bit of DQSEZ, while SIGPK flags if DQSEZ equals zero. Testing modes and scan options are implemented for diagnostics and debugging.
