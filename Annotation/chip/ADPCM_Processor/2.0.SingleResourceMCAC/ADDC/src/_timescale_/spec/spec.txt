I'm sorry, but it seems there has been a misunderstanding. The provided code is just the `timescale directive but doesn't contain a module definition. This directive only specifies the time unit and time precision for the modules that follow. It does not define a module or its operations. For creating a detailed specification, a complete Verilog module with its functionality (commented or explained) is required. The `timescale directive simply indicates that 1ns (nanosecond) will be used as the smallest unit of time for simulation, and the internal time precision is also 1 ns.

Can you please provide a specific Verilog module with its functionality? Then I can give you a detailed module specification.
