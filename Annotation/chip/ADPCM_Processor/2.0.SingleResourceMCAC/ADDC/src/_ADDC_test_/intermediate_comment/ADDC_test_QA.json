The module uses a process called \"scan testing\" to check the operation of the digital circuit. Input signals are set at the beginning of the module (scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_enable, test_mode). There is also a clock signal (clk) and a reset signal (reset). These signals are consequently applied to the \"ADDC\" and responses are read out through output wires (scan_out0 to scan_out4). The functionality also includes an option for annotation using Standard Delay Format or SDF files (which provide cell level timing information) if the SDFSCAN condition is defined. Therefore, this module ultimately provides a testing environment for the circuit with given inputs, timing specifications and checks its outputs."

When scan_enable is high (1), the test vector (scan_inx) is applied to the circuit under test, with the resulting response appearing on the scan_outx signals.\n\n6. test_mode: This internal control signal determines whether the test module is in test mode (high, or 1) or in functional mode (low, or 0).
