    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The \"test\" module provides a testing environment for the \"ADDC\" adder circuit. This module employs a scan testing technique to validate the operation of the digital circuit design, setting input signals such as test data inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), a scan enable signal (scan_enable), a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (reset), and a test mode signal (test_mode) at the beginning. The ADDC circuit is then subject to these input signals and generates response on output wires (scan_out0 to scan_out4). The functionality also considers optional annotations based on defined Standard Delay Format (SDF) condition, which provides added timing detail at various cellular levels of the circuit. \n\nThe module engages five input ports (scan_in0 to scan_in4), a clock input (clk), a reset input (reset), a test mode switch (test_mode), and a scan test activation (scan_enable). The input ports introduce user-defined test data for the ADDC circuit. Clk and reset are control signals that synchronize all operations and reset the circuit to its initial state, respectively, while test_mode switches the circuit between testing and functional modes. Scan_enable activates the scan testing process. The five output ports (scan_out0 to scan_out4) capture the response from the ADDC circuit upon test data input, and this response is used to validate the functionality of the ADDC design.\n\nInternally, the module uses similar control signals and test data signals, which are integral to triggering testing processes and generating test responses. The module splits into identifiable blocks, including wire and registry definitions, interfacing with the ADDC circuit block, and the initial block that defines SDF annotations, time formatting, test settings, and the termination of the testing process. The results allow an assessment of the ADDC circuit's functional correctness, making the module a vital instrument in design verification.",
