Module-level comment: The "test" module performs scan testing on the ADDC digital circuit using test data inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4) and control signals (clk, reset, scan_enable, test_mode). Interfacing with ADDC, it applies input signals and captures responses on scan_out. It supports SDF timing annotations when SDFSCAN is defined. Operations are initialized under the defined conditions (clock and reset low, scan_enable and test_mode inactive) and test completion triggers its finish.
