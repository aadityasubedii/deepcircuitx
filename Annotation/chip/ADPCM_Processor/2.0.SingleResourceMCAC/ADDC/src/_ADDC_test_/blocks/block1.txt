This block initializes certain simulation parameters and sets all signal inputs to the test top module at low state. It starts by setting the timestamp format for simulation outputs. Then, it checks if "SDFSCAN" is defined; if so, it uses the Standard Delay Format (SDF) file 'ADDC_tsmc18_scan.sdf' to annotate the simulation with accurate timing information. This block then initializes the clock, reset signal, five scan inputs (used in scan-chain testing), scan_enabling, and test_mode signals to zero. Finally, a system task $finish is called immediately to conclude the simulation execution.
