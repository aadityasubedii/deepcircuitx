Module name: test. 

Module specification: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter) module named 'uart', providing a means to validate its functionalities. The module is designed with several input and output ports and internal signals for thorough testing. The input ports include 'clk' and 'reset' which respectively provides a clock signal and a reset signal to the UART module. In addition, there are five scan test inputs 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4' and a 'scan_enable' signal used for fine-grained testing. Port 'test_mode' helps transition the system into a testing state. The module has five corresponding output ports, 'scan_out0' through 'scan_out4', which display results of the scan tests. Internally, these signals handle the operations of testing and provide feedback. The module instantiates an instance of 'uart', mapping each of its inputs, outputs and bidirectional ports to those declared in the test environment. The initial block in the code sets the time format and conditionally includes an SDF (Standard Delay Format) file for more accurate timing data during simulation. It then initializes all input signals to 0, effectively testing the 'uart' module in a reset state before ending the simulation. This module provides a detailed framework for testing 'uart' under specified conditions.
