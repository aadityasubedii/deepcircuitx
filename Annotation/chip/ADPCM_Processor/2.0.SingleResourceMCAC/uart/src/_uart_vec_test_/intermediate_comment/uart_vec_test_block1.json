    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes several signals in a testbench. The time format for the simulation is set using the $timeformat command. Conditionally, if SDFSCAN is defined, annotation is performed on the testbench using the specified Standard Delay Format (SDF) file. Then, clock, reset, the scan inputs, scan enable, and test mode are all initialized to 0. The block is terminated with the $finish command, signaling the end of the stimulation run."
