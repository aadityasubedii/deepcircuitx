    "spec": "Module name: test.\n\nModule specification: The 'test' module establishes basic setup for a user-defined module 'uart'. It serves primarily as a test setup for 'uart' and operates based on the input and output signals it receives and sends. The input ports include 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in[0-4]', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'. Here, 'clk' is the clock signal used for timing and synchronization of operations. The 'reset' port sets the system to a known initial state. 'scan_in[0-4]' are input scanning lines used for testing purposes, particularly in scan testing methods. 'scan_enable' is a control signal that enables scanning inputs, and 'test_mode' puts the module into testing mode when active. The output ports include 'scan_out[0-4]', which are used to supply scanned test results from the 'uart' module. The internal signals mirror their input port counterparts, with the addition of a 'clk_count' and 'testfail', though their behaviours are not defined in the code provided. The module is divided into different blocks, including the initiation of the 'uart' module and the setting of time format and initial states for all regs. The optional inclusion of a Standard Delay File (SDF) is also noted for situations where 'SDFSCAN' is defined. In sum, the 'test' module serves as a structural and operational base for testing the 'uart' module.",
