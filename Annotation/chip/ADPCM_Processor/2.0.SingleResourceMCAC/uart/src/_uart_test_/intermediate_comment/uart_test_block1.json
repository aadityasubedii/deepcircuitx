    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for initializing system states and settings. It begins by setting the timestamp format to nanoseconds, then applies Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotation if in scan mode for circuit testing. Afterwards, it initializes several scan inputs, scan_enable, test_mode and both clock and reset signals to binary 0. The initialization process completes by calling `$finish` to end the simulation."
