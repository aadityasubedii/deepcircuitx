Module-level comment: The 'test' module sets up the 'uart' module for testing purposes. It uses signals such as 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in[0-4]', 'scan_enable', 'test_mode' for inputs and receives scanned outputs through 'scan_out[0-4]'. An initial block sets the time format, initializes all reg inputs to 0, with optional SDF annotation when 'SDFSCAN' is defined.
