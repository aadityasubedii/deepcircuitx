Comment: 
This Verilog block is a byte receiver which operates on each clock's positive edge or reset and receives data serially in byte order. It has various receiver states like RXD_IDLE, RXD_START, RXD_START_MID1, RXD_START_MID, RXD_DATA0 to RXD_DATA7, and RXD_STOP for different data bits. It initiates in RXD_IDLE state and if there's no overflow in rx_fifo, it moves to RXD_START state enabling data reception. Then it sequentially captures the state of input at 'i_uart_rxd' on each 'RX_BITPULSE_COUNT' in an 8-bit 'rx_byte' data from LSB to MSB. Finally, it goes to the RXD_STOP state and return back to the RXD_IDLE state, ready for the next byte. The receiver state machine is reset to RXD_IDLE in case of an unexpected scenario.
