Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for handling the overflow and underflow conditions of the UART Transmit (TX) and Receive (RX) FIFO buffers. On every positive edge of reset or clock, the code monitors these buffers. If the RX FIFO is empty and there is a request to pop (remove) data, it signals an Underflow condition and writes an error message. Conversely, if the RX FIFO is full and there's a request to push (add) data, it signals an Overflow condition, and writes another error message. It also checks if the TX FIFO is full while there is a request to add data, signals an Overflow condition, and consequently displays a message containing the character attempted to be added.
