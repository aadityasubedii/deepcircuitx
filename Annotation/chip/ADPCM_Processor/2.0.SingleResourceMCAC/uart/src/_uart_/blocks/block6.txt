Comment: 
This block handles communication with a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter). It is event-driven, responding to rising edges on 'reset' or 'clk' signals. Inside, it first checks for a reset signal and does nothing. Else, it enters a process which checks if a read acknowledgment ('wb_read_ack') or write initiation ('wb_start_write') has happened. If true, it prints debugging messages on UART registers based on the 'i_wb_adr' address range. Addresses map to different registers and specific operations, with a default case to catch unaccounted addresses. Information about operations and the corresponding addresses are displayed. In 'wb_start_write', writing to UART registers is performed, otherwise, reading from UART registers ('o_wb_dat') occurs.
