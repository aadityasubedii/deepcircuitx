Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for displaying the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) period computed based-on clock period and transmission bitrate under the test. Specifically, it calculates the UART period by multiplying the sum of `TX_BITPULSE_COUNT` and `TX_BITADJUST_COUNT` (parameters determining the transmission speed) by the `CLK_PERIOD`, and compares it to the desired `UART_WORD_PERIOD`, logging these values for debugging or validation purposes.
