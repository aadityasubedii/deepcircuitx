This block implements a pulse counter for a receiver bit in a Verilog digital system. Upon receiving a positive edge trigger from either the reset or the clk signal, the block resets the `rx_bit_pulse_count` if the `reset` or the `restart_rx_bit_count` signals are high. If not, it increments the `rx_bit_pulse_count` by 1. The count is reset to 0 when the system is reset or when the `restart_rx_bit_count` signal is high, ensuring the pulse count is always accurate.
