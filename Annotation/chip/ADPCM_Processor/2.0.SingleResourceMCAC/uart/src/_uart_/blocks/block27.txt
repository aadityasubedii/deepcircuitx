Comment: 
The block of code assigns a transmission byte (tx_byte) based on the state of the FIFO enable flag (fifo_enable). When the FIFO enable flag is set, the 4 least significant bits of the Read Pointer of the transmit FIFO buffer (tx_fifo_rp) are used as an index to select a byte from the buffer (tx_fifo) for transmission. If the FIFO enable flag is not set, the first byte of the transmit buffer is selected for transmission.
