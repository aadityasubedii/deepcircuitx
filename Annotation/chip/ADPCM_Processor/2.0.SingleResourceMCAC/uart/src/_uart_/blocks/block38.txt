The block of code is used for generating an acknowledge signal for a Wishbone protocol. The acknowledge signal (o_wb_ack) is set when the strobe input (i_wb_stb) is active and either a write or read operation has been initialised. The write operation is denoted by wb_start_write, and the read operation, delayed by one clock cycle, is denoted by wb_start_read_d1. This design provides an efficient, concurrent handling of read or write requests in a WB compliant system.
