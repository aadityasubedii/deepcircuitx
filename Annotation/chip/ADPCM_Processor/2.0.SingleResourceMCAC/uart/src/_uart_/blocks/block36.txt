The block of code controls the reading and writing behavior of the receiving (RX) FIFO buffer. This buffer temporarily stores data that is received. Whether data can be read from or written into the RX FIFO buffer is controlled by signals which follow the FIFO protocol. The rx_fifo_pop signal triggers when the wishbone starts reading and the address equals to AMBER_UART_DR. The rx_fifo_push_not_full signal indicates that the buffer can accept more data. This signal is active when data write operation is initiated and the buffer is not full. Similarly, the rx_fifo_pop_not_empty signal shows that the buffer has data to be read, and it is active when the data read operation is initiated and the buffer is not empty. The rx_fifo_half_or_more signal is set when the fifo count is half or more than its total capacity, indicating that it is either half-full or more.
