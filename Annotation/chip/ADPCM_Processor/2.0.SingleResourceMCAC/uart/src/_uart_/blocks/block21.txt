This block implements a ripple counter with synchronous reset functionality and additional logic for manipulating a transmission bit pulse. Upon the activation of the reset signal or at the positive edge of the clock cycle, the counts of transmission bit pulse and transmission bit pulse count get reset to zero. If not reset, the logic checks if the transmission bit pulse count matches the target values based on the transmission state condition and resets the count while setting a bit high, else it increments the counter by one and resets the bit.
