Comment: 
The code block is responsible for assigning the `wb_read_ack` signal, which is an acknowledgment of a read operation from a Wishbone interface. The `wb_read_ack` is set true when a strobe signal `i_wb_stb` is received, the write-enable signal `i_wb_we` is not active indicating it's a read operation, and a non-blocking assignment to the `o_wb_ack` output signal has successfully occurred. The use of bitwise AND operation `&&` ensures that all conditions are met for `wb_read_ack` to be asserted.
