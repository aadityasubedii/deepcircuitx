Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for setting 'wb_wdata32' and 'o_wb_dat' differently according to the 'WB_DWIDTH' configuration. If 'WB_DWIDTH' is set to 128, 'wb_wdata32' is selected from quarters of 'i_wb_dat' based on the 3rd and 2nd bits of the address 'i_wb_adr'. Then, 'o_wb_dat' is generated by duplicating 'wb_rdata32' four times. Otherwise, if 'WB_DWIDTH' is 32, both 'wb_wdata32' and 'o_wb_dat' are assigned the same value as 'i_wb_dat' and 'wb_rdata32' respectively.
