Module name: uart. Module specification: This module implements a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface with configurable baud rates and FIFO buffers for both TX and RX. It supports Wishbone bus interface for configuration and data transfer. Input ports include system clock (clk), reset, scan chain inputs, Wishbone interface signals, UART Clear To Send (CTS), and receive data (RXD). Output ports include scan chain outputs, Wishbone interface signals, UART interrupt, transmit data (TXD), and Request To Send (RTS). Internal signals manage TX and RX FIFOs, state machines, and timing controls. The module is divided into several blocks: Wishbone interface handling, TX and RX FIFO management, TX and RX state machines, baud rate generation, and register access. It includes features such as interrupt generation, flow control (
