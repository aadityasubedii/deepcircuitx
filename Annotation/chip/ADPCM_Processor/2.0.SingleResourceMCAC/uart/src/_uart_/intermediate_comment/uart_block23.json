    "block_comment": "This block implements a first in, first out (FIFO) buffer for transmission (tx) data. At the rising edge of reset or clock (clk), it checks if reset is active; if so, it empties the FIFO and resets all control flags. If there's no reset but fifo_enable is active, data is written into FIFO if not full, and the write pointer is incremented. If FIFO is not empty, the read pointer is incremented. The FIFO count is adjusted based on whether data is pushed or popped. If fifo_enable is not active, any incoming data is written to the first position in FIFO, updating the full flag accordingly.\n"
