    "block_comment": "The block assigns an output interrupt signal (`o_uart_int`) for a UART interface. This is achieved using bitwise AND `&` and OR `|` operations between the variables, `tx_interrupt` and `rx_interrupt`, which represent transmit and receive interrupts respectively, and the 5th and 4th bit of the control register `uart_cr_reg`. The `o_uart_int` signal is asserted when a transmit interrupt is generated and enabled (`uart_cr_reg[5]` is set), or when a receive interrupt is generated and enabled (`uart_cr_reg[4]` is set)."
