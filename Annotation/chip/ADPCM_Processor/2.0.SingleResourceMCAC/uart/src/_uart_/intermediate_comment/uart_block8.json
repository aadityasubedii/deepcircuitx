    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily designed and implemented to manage interrupt signals in a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) within a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) context. When reset is not enabled and the write operation to the UART ICR (Interrupt Control Register) is not started, the code first splits behavior based on the FIFO being enabled or disabled. If the FIFO is enabled, the block checks conditions based on the status of tx_interrupt, tx_fifo_half_or_less_full and uart_cr_reg[5] and displays corresponding messages. It follows a similar flow for the case when FIFO is disabled, but checks with tx_fifo_empty instead."
