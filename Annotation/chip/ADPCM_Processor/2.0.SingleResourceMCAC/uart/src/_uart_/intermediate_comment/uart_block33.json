    "block_comment": "This block controls the process of interrupt setting in a system based on some conditions. It primarily runs at the positive edge of the \"reset\" or \"clk\" signals. When a reset occurs, the interrupt, labeled as \"rx_interrupt\", is set to 0. However, if the system is not in reset and a \"fifo_enable\" is active, the block sets the \"rx_interrupt\" based on either the condition of the reception fifo being half full or more, or when a reception interrupt timer matches a predefined interrupt count. If \"fifo_enable\" is not active, the \"rx_interrupt\" is set when the rx_fifo is full."
