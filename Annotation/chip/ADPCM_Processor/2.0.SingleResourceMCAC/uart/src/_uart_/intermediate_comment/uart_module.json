    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a UART interface with configurable baud rates and FIFO buffers for TX/RX. It supports Wishbone bus interface for configuration and data transfer. The module uses state machines for TX/RX operations, manages FIFO buffers, generates interrupts, and provides flow control. It includes baud rate generation, register access, and supports both FIFO-enabled and disabled modes. The implementation handles start/stop bits, data bits, and configurable parameters for UART communication."
