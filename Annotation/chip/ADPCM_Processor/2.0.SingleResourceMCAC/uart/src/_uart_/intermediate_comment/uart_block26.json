    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for pushing data into a transmit FIFO buffer. This operation happens when a write command is initiated (signified by 'wb_start_write') and when the address from the lowest 16 bits of an input 'i_wb_adr' matches with 'AMBER_UART_DR', a pre-defined transmit data register address."
