    "block_comment": "This block manages the receive FIFO push operation in a serial communication system. When the receiver's state machine enters the STOP state and the bit pulse count reaches 0, a signal, rx_fifo_push, is assigned to trigger the push operation into the receiver FIFO. The block achieves this function by using an assignment operation with two condition checks: it checks if the rxd_state machine is at the STOP state and if the rx_bit_pulse_count is equal to 0."
