    "block_comment": "This Verilog block of code is responsible for managing the UART transmitter interrupt signal (`tx_interrupt`). It does so by utilizing a synchronous design where the block only reacts to the positive edges of the `reset` or `clk` signals. If a `reset` is triggered, the `tx_interrupt` is set to be zero instantly. In contrast, if a write operation is started (`wb_start_write`) and is addressing the AMBER_UART_ICR register, `tx_interrupt` is also zeroed. If neither `reset` nor `wb_start_write` are active, the `tx_interrupt` state depends on the enabled status of a FIFO buffer (`fifo_enable`). If FIFO is enabled and half or less than half of it is full (`tx_fifo_half_or_less_full`), `tx_interrupt` will reflect the condition of the 6th bit of the `uart_cr_reg` register. But if FIFO isn't enabled, `tx_interrupt` reflects if the FIFO is empty (`tx_fifo_empty`) and the state of the 6th bit of the `uart_cr_reg` register."
