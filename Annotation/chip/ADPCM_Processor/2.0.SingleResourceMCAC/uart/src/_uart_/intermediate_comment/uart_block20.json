    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to manage the transmission of data in a serial communication protocol, most likely UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter), in a state-machine-like flow. At clock positive edge, data byte is processed bit by bit into the 'txd' signal, changing states from data bit 0 through to data bit 7, followed by stop signals before returning to the idle state. Upon system 'reset', the state is set to the idle, while always ensuring that the 'txd' signal is high unless transmitting. It enters transmission state when 'uart0_cts_n_d' signal is low meaning ready to send data and the 'tx_fifo' is not empty. Based on its state, a specific bit from the byte is extracted and sent through 'txd'. It moves to the different data states until all bits are sent, finalizes with stop signals state, then returns to the idle state, ready for the next byte."
