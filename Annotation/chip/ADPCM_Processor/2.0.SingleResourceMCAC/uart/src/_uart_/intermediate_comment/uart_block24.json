    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code is primarily handling the condition to pop an element from the transmit FIFO buffer. The line of code is an `assign` statement, which suggests that it's continuously assigning the result of the expression to the `tx_fifo_pop_not_empty` signal. The existed condition to determine when an item gets popped from the transmit FIFO buffer (`tx_fifo_pop_not_empty`) relies on three conditions: when the transmit state machine is in the `TXD_STOP3` state, when `tx_bit_pulse` equals 1, and when the `tx_fifo` is not empty. These conditions indicate that the FIFO is not empty and ready to transmit."
