    "block_comment": "This block enables the TX_FIFO (transmitter-first in, first out) to make sure its occupancy is half full or less. The design is achieved by the keyword 'assign' to continuously monitor the 'tx_fifo_count' condition, signalling whether it holds a value less than or equal to 8, which represents half or less occupancy in a 16-depth FIFO system."
