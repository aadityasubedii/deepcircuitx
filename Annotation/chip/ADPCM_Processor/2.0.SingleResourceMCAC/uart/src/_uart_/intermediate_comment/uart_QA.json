It handles both transmitting and receiving data serially, with configurable baud rates and FIFO buffers for both TX and RX. The module supports Wishbone bus interface for configuration and data transfer. It includes features such as interrupt generation, flow control (CTS/RTS), and configurable FIFO depths. The UART can operate in both FIFO-enabled and disabled modes, and includes state machines for managing the transmission and reception of data bits, including start, stop, and data bits."
