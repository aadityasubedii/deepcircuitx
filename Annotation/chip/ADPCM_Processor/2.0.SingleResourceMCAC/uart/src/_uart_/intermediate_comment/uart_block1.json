    "block_comment": "I'm sorry, but as per the information provided there's no specific Verilog RTL code block to summarize. However, if for example, you had code that defined a flip-flop, you might process it as follows:\n\n```verilog\nmodule Dff (input D, C, reset, output reg Q);\n  always @(posedge C or negedge reset)\n    if (reset)\n      Q <= 1'b0;\n    else\n      Q <= D;\nendmodule\n```\n\nYou could then generate comment for above code:\n\"The block defines a D flip-flop module. On the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of the reset signal, it sets the output Q to low if reset is active, otherwise Q takes the state of the input D.\""
