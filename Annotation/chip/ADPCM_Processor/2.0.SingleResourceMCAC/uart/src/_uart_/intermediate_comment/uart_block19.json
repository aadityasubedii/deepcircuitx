    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for controlling the \"Ready to Send\" (RTS) signal in a UART communication system. In terms of implementation, the assignment takes the complement of the \"rxen\" signal, meaning that when the receiver enable signal, \"rxen\", is high (1), the ready to send signal, \"o_uart_rts_n\", will be low (0), indicating that the UART is ready to send data. Similarly, when the \"rxen\" is low, the \"o_uart_rts_n\" will be high, indicating that the UART is not ready to send data."
