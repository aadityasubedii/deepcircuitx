    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs error checking for UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) transmission. The block calculates the transmission bit pulse period by multiplying the TX_BITPULSE_COUNT constant with the CLK_PERIOD constant. The block then compares the calculated bit pulse period to the defined UART_BIT_PERIOD modulated by 1.03 and 0.97 respectively. If these thresholds are violated, the block will trigger an error message detailing the problem with the current bit pulse period, the baud rate being used, and suggestions on whether to decrease the baud rate or increase the system clock frequency."
