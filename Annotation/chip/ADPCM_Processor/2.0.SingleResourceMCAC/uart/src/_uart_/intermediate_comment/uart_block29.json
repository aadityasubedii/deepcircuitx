    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the TX_FIFO status. By using conditional assignment, it determines whether the FIFO is full or empty, based on whether the FIFO is enabled or not. If the FIFO is enabled, it checks if the FIFO count is greater than or equal to 16 (meaning it's full) and if the count is equal to 0 (meaning it's empty). If the FIFO isn't enabled, it uses the tx_fifo_full_flag directly to set the full and empty status."
