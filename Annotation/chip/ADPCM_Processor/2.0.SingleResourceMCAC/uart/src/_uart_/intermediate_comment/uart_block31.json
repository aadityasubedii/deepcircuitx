    "block_comment": "The block of code enables or disables the FIFO functionality based on a specific register in UART's Line Control High Register (LCRH). It implements this by assigning the value of the fifth bit (bit number 4 due to 0-indexing) of the uart_lcrh_reg to the fifo_enable signal, using a continuous assignment statement. If the fifth bit of the LCRH register is set to 1, the FIFO functionality is enabled; otherwise, it's disabled.\n"
