    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles FIFO operation and generates an interrupt based on a timer. This block is composed of three sections of functionality triggered by the signals 'reset', 'clk', and 'fifo_enable'. On a high 'reset' signal, the initialization takes place, setting the FIFO and count registers to default values. In the absence of 'reset' signal and presence of 'fifo_enable' command, data is read from and written to the FIFO with appropriate indexing and incrementation of pointers, implemented by 'rx_fifo_push_not_full' and 'rx_fifo_pop_not_empty'. Concurrently, the count of items in FIFO is updated with every FIFO operation. Finally, if the FIFO is not empty, a timer increments until it reaches a specified count (RX_INTERRUPT_COUNT). When 'fifo_enable' is not true, the timer is reset and FIFO is operated without indexing, which reflects a fall-back scenario for direct data transfer."
