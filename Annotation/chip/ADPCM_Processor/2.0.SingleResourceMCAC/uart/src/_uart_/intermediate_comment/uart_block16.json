    "block_comment": "This Verilog block manages the serial data input (rxd) of a UART receiver. When the system receives a reset signal, it initializes the 'rxd_d' to a pre-defined value of '1F'. During a clock cycle where no reset occurs, the system left-shifts the elements of the 'rxd_d' array by one and puts the latest value of the UART receiver input (i_uart_rxd) at the end. Hence, this code manages the timing and order of data reception."
