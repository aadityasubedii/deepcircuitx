    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the string representation of the state of transmission (TXD) to the variable xTXD_STATE. This is accomplished using a ternary operator (? :) which checks the current state of a variable (txd_state) and assigns the string equivalent to xTXD_STATE. If none of the conditions are met, the state \"UNKNOWN\" is assigned to xTXD_STATE."
