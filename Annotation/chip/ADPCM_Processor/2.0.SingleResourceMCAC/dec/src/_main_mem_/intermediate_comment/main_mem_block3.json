    "block_comment": "This block performs a conditional data read operation, with built-in reset functionality. It initiates on either a positive clock edge or a reset signal. When a reset signal is encountered, the block forcefully sets states of 'start_read_d1', 'start_read_d2', and 'wb_rdata32' to zero. Otherwise, on each positive clock edge, 'start_read_d1' acquires the value of 'start_read', and 'start_read_d2' takes the value of 'start_read_d1'. When 'start_read_d1' is true, it reads the 'rd_data' based on the lower two bits of 'addr_d1', essentially extracting a 32-bit section from 'rd_data' based on the given address."
