It functions by monitoring incoming read and write requests from connected Wishbone master(s), serving requested data for reads, and storing incoming data for writes to its internal RAM. The memory addressing and data handling are adaptable to the Wishbone data width which may be 32-bit or 128-bit, configured via the parameter WB_DWIDTH. Other controls for test-mode, scan-enable, and memory address selection (i_mem_ctrl) are also provided with this module. Note that this module also includes debug information (disabled by default) for memory write operations."
