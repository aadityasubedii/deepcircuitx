    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for defining a write-back data width of 128 bits. It achieves this using conditional generation ('generate-if' construct) and initiates by checking if the write-back data width (WB_DWIDTH) is equal to 128, which might be globally defined elsewhere in the code, possibly based on system requirements. If this condition is satisfied, it defines a 128-bit register (wb_rdata128) designed to hold write-back data of that width, offering flexibility in controlling the write-back data size in the system."
