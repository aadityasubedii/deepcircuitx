    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements an output multiple assignment statement where output wire 'o_wb_dat' is assigned the value of a read data (from a 128-bit wide 'wishbone' bus) and 'o_wb_ack' is assigned the output of a logical AND operation between the input write strobe input signal ('i_wb_stb') and the ORed value of two signal flags, 'start_write' and 'start_read_d2'. The block essentially controls the flow of output data onto the bus and acknowledges write/read commands based on given signal conditions."
