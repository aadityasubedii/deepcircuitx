    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for conditionally updating memory and managing write enable signals. Upon a reset signal trigger, the write enable settings, write mask, write data, and first delayed address are reset, while emptying the memory. Without a reset, when a clock signal triggers, variables are updated to prepare for a potential memory write action. If writing is enabled, memory at the relevant address is updated. For accessing memory, necessary permissions are adjusted depending on the memory control value."
