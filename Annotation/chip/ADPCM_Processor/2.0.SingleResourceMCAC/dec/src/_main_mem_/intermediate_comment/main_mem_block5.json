    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a masking operation on a 128-bit data. There are 16 mask flags in `wr_mask[]` array that decide whether corresponding 8-bit segments from `rd_data[]` or `wr_data[]` should be chosen. If the flag is set (`wr_mask[i]=1`), it takes the 8-bit data from `rd_data[]`, otherwise (`wr_mask[i]=0`) it picks from `wr_data[]`. This operation continues in a loop for all 16 segments hence forming a 128-bit `masked_wdata[]` through conditional assignments."
