Module-level comment: The 'main_mem' module acts as memory interfacing with a Wishbone bus. It processes both read and write requests via input ports from Wishbone master(s) and manages its internal RAM array using 'ram', 'start_read', 'start_write', 'rd_data', and 'masked_wdata'. Addressing modes and data handling adapt to the Wishbone data width (32 or 128 bits) via 'generate' block. 'Always' blocks maintain register states and define behavior on each clock cycle. The module has been carefully crafted for error-free and efficient memory access within a Wishbone bus system.
