Comment: 
This line of RTL Verilog code assigns the 32-bit read data (wb_rdata32) from the wishbone interface to the output wire 'o_wb_dat'. The assignment operation here uses a continuous assignment statement, which means the output 'o_wb_dat' will be constantly updated as soon as there is a change in 'wb_rdata32'.
