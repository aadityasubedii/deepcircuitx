This block of Verilog code controls write operations in a memory module. On each reset or clock cycle, it checks if reset is enabled, if so it sets all the write enable (wr_en), memory address (addr_d1) and write data (wr_data) to zero and initializes the entire memory (ram) to zero. When reset is not enabled but the clock cycle is positive, write operations are controlled based on the value of start_write, mask value is set based on the address bits of i_wb_adr, wr_data is set as four instances of i_wb_dat, and addr_d1 is set according to memory control (i_mem_ctrl). If a write enable (wr_en) operation is made, it updates the ram and provides a log message when debugging is enabled.
