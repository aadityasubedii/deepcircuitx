Module name: main_mem. 

Module specification: The main_mem module is a memory module interfacing with a Wishbone bus, serving incoming read/write requests from Wishbone master(s) by accessing its internal memory array. 

The module includes input ports such as 'clk' (the clock signal), 'reset' (resets the module's state to initial values), 'scan_enable' (enabling scan mode), 'test_mode', 'i_mem_ctrl' (controls the addressing mode), 'i_wb_adr' (memory address from the Wishbone master), 'i_wb_sel' (selects byte enables in writing phase), 'i_wb_we' (Wishbone write enable signal to decide the type of operation), 'i_wb_dat' (data to be written into memory), 'i_wb_cyc' (indicates a valid bus cycle), and 'i_wb_stb' (indicates a valid data transfer or address phase). 

Output ports include 'o_wb_dat' (data output to Wishbone bus, used when read operation is requested), 'o_wb_ack' (Wishbone acknowledge signal to indicate that data transfer has been successfully completed), and 'o_wb_err' (Wishbone error signal, used to indicate if an error has occurred during data transfer). 

Internally, the module uses signals such as 'ram' (the memory array), 'start_write' and 'start_read' (signal the initiation of memory write and read operations respectively), 'rd_data' (holds read data), 'masked_wdata' (holds masked write data), 'wr_en', 'wr_mask', 'wr_data' (control write operations), and 'addr_d1' (holds delayed version of the supplied address). 

The code includes various blocks for handling specific tasks: he conditional 'generate' block is used to configure operations according to the Wishbone data width (128 or 32 bits); the 'always' block is used for setting initial states and defining the behavior of registers on each clock cycle; and finally, 'masked' block to mask write data. 

The main_mem module is robustly designed to fulfill the memory requests while meeting the complexities of Wishbone bus operation, which makes it a key component in systems that utilize a Wishbone bus for inter-component communication.
