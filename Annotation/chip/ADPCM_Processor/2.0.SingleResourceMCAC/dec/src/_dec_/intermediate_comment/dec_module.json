    "module": "Module-level comment: /* This 'dec' module serves as a top-level system controller, integrating various subsystems including clock management, memory operations, serial communication, and interrupt handling. It utilizes a Wishbone bus architecture to interconnect multiple components such as a clock generator, memory, coprocessor, UART, TDMI/TDMO interfaces, and an interrupt controller. The module manages data flow and control signals between these components, orchestrating system-wide operations through carefully coordinated clock domains and interrupt handling mechanisms. */"
