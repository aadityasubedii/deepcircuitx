Module name: dec. Module specification: The "dec" module is a complex top-level system that coordinates various subsystems in a hardware design. It includes clock management, memory operations, serial communication, and interrupt handling. The module has input ports for reset, clock, decoding signals, scan testing, and UART communication, as well as Wishbone interface inputs for memory-mapped and configurable devices. Output ports include decoded signals, scan test outputs, UART communication, and Wishbone interface outputs for memory-mapped and configurable devices. Internal signals manage clock distribution, Wishbone bus operations, and interrupt handling. The module consists of several key components: a clock generator (CLK_GEN), a Wishbone arbiter, boot memory, a coprocessor (APRSC), UART interface, TDMI (Time Division Multiplexed Interface), a test module, a timer, an interrupt controller, TDMO (Time Division
