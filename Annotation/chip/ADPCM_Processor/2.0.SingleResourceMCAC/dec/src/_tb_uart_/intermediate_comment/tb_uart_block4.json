    "block_comment": "This block of code handles a UART receiver's bit count. At positive edges of either the reset or UART clock signal, it defines the condition to reset 'rx_bit_count' to zero. This reset is triggered either when a reset signal is sent, when 'rx_bit_count' reaches 9 or a negative edge start is detected in Rx. If none of these conditions meet, it increments 'rx_bit_count'."
