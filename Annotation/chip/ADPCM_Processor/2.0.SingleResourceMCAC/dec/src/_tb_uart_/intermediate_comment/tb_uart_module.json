    "module": "Module-level comment: The tb_uart module serves as a testbench for UART, allowing for control over serial communication, including data reception and transmission. It uses a variety of input and output ports, such as clk, reset, test_mode and others to manage these operations. The module contains internal signals for handling data communication, clock control, and FIFO operations. It uses condition-rich always blocks to control signal assignment dynamically and case blocks to manage data reception states."
