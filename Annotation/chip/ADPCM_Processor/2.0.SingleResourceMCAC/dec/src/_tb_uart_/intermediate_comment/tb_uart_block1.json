    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a UART Receiver module which is responsible for receiving and interpreting serial data. Upon a positive edge of a reset or clock signal, the state, bit, byte, and tap variables are reset. The state and bit variables are updated as per the UART receiving specifications within a case statement. The block also captures and shifts received serial data bit and increments the bit count when state is 1 or at the start of Data Transfer. If incoming serial data doesn\u2019t match specified terminate characters (Carriage Return and Line Feed, ASCII 0D and 0C), it's written to the output as a character."
