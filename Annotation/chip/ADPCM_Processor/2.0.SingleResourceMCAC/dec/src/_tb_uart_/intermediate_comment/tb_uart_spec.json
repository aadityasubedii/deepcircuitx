    "spec": "Module name: tb_uart. \nModule specification: The tb_uart is a testbench for a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter), designed to facilitate serial communication through control of data transmission and reception. The module utilizes multiple input and output ports for versatile functionality. \n\nThe input ports include clk (clock control signal), reset (to reset system state), scan_enable and test_mode for testing control, i_uart_cts_n (Channel Terminal Ready from UART) and i_uart_rxd (Data received from a different device by UART). These are used to navigate transmission of data, testing procedures, and maintaining the data cycle within the module. \n\nAs for the output ports, o_uart_txd (Data transmission register) and o_uart_rts_n (Request to send signal from UART) are included. These outputs aid in the transmission of data and sending requests as part of the data communication of UART.\n\nInternal signals such as clk_uart (UART-specific clock) are used, along with various other signals that handle the reception and transmission ends of UART data communication. These include rx_state, rx_bit, rx_byte and others for managing the reception, and tx_state, tx_bit, tx_byte, and others for managing the transmission. For FIFO operations, signals such as txfifo_empty, txfifo_full, tx_fifo, txfifo_wp and txfifo_rp are employed.\n\nThe code is broken up into different sections, each responsible for a specific task, such as signal assignment, conditions for signal control during data transmission and reception, and cases that determine how the data reception states are transitioned. Altogether this ensures efficient and controlled operations, making tb_uart the complete package for a UART testbench.",

The module utilizes multiple input and output ports for versatile functionality. \n\nThe input ports include clk (clock control signal), reset (to reset system state), scan_enable and test_mode for testing control, i_uart_cts_n (Channel Terminal Ready from UART) and i_uart_rxd (Data received from a different device by UART). These are used to navigate transmission of data, testing procedures, and maintaining the data cycle within the module. \n\nAs for the output ports, o_uart_txd (Data transmission register) and o_uart_rts_n (Request to send signal from UART) are included. These outputs aid in the transmission of data and sending requests as part of the data communication of UART.\n\nInternal signals such as clk_uart (UART-specific clock) are used, along with various other signals that handle the reception and transmission ends of UART data communication. These include rx_state, rx_bit, rx_byte and others for managing the reception, and tx_state, tx_bit, tx_byte, and others for managing the transmission. For FIFO operations, signals such as txfifo_empty, txfifo_full, tx_fifo, txfifo_wp and txfifo_rp are employed.\n\nThe code is broken up into different sections, each responsible for a specific task, such as signal assignment, conditions for signal control during data transmission and reception, and cases that determine how the data reception states are transitioned. Altogether this ensures efficient and controlled operations, making tb_uart the complete package for a UART testbench."
