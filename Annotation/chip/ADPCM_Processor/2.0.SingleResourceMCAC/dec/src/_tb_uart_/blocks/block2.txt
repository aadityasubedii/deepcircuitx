The logic assignment manages the detection of negative edge signal in a receiver operation. This is done by assigning 'rx_start_negedge' to true when 'rx_tap[1]' is true, 'rx_tap[0]' is false, and 'rx_state' is at its initial binary value of '00'. This logic ensures that a negative edge in the received signal only gets marked as the start when the reception is in its idle state.
