This block of code is responsible for loading the boot memory from a specified file on reset (`BOOT_MEM_FILE`) in a testing environment. On a positive edge reset, it initializes boot memory loading by opening the specified file and iteratively reading lines from it. Details captured from each line, like file address and data, are then inserted into a boot memory array. Additionally, it also checks the file loading process, producing an error if the file cannot be opened or if a line does not start with the correct format, and displays the boot memory loading data for each line when the AMBER_LOAD_MEM_DEBUG is set. After reading all lines, it records the number of lines read and sets up parameters like timeout and core string variances for the test. It finally opens a log file to record test information.
