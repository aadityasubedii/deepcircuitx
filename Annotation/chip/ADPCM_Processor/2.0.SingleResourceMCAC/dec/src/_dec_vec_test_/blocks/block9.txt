This small block of Verilog RTL code is a compilation directive. This code is mainly used as a preprocessing directive in Verilog, serving a quite similar function as '#ifndef' in C programming. "`ifndef NETLIST" is mainly checking if NETLIST isn't defined. If NETLIST is not defined then the code following this line until a corresponding "`endif" will be included in the compilation. This pre-processing directive is commonly used in Verilog code to prevent multiple inclusions of the same module or to conditionally compile only certain portions of the code.
