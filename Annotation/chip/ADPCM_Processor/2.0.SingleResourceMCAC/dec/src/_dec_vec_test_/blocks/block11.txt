The block of code primarily loads data into the main memory system in a reset state. When the system is reset, the block initiates a sequence for loading data from a main memory file into the system's RAM. The process is synchronized to the system clock. It first opens the file and checks if it is valid. If not, an error is displayed. If the file is valid, it begins to read each line of the file. Each line is checked for specific formatting requirements, and if these requirements are not met, an error is displayed and the process is halted. For valid lines, the hex character data will be parsed and inserted into the main system RAM at the specified address. The block keeps track of the line count and displays it at the end.
