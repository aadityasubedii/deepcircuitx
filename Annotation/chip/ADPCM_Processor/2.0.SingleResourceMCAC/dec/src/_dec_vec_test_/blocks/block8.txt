This line of Verilog code performs the function of loading in local parameter values from an external file. It uses an 'include directive, which provides a way to share common pieces of code among different files in Verilog. This directive integrates the contents of the file "a25_localparams.vh" into the file where this line is included. This is a handy means in Verilog to incorporate common parameter settings, definitions, or general utility functions defined once in a separate file and used in multiple modules.
