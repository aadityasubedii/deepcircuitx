Module-level comment: This testbench module verifies the functionality of a hardware decoder (DEC) system. It initializes the system, loads memory files, generates clock signals, and applies test vectors. The module configures the DUT, simulates input/output operations, and checks for errors by comparing outputs against expected results. It handles reset sequences, memory loading, and timing control, providing a comprehensive test environment for the decoder system under various conditions.
