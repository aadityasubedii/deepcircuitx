Module name: test. Module specification: This module is a testbench for a hardware decoder (DEC) system. It sets up test parameters, loads memory files, generates clock signals, and simulates input/output operations to verify the correct functioning of the decoder under various conditions. The module doesn't have explicit input or output ports, as it's a self-contained testbench. Instead, it generates stimuli internally and monitors the behavior of the instantiated design under test (DUT). Key internal signals include clocks (clk, uart_clk), reset signals, test vectors (data_in_vec, data_out_vec), and various counters and configuration registers. The module is organized into several sections: initialization, memory loading, clock generation, test vector application, and result verification. It includes functionality for configuring the system, running test vectors, checking for errors, and displaying test results. The testbench also handles reset sequences, memory loading
