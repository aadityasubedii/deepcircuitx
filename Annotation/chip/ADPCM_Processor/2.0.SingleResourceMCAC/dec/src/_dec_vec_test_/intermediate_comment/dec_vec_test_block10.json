    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for initiating a dump of the Value Change Dump (VCD) information, which contains all simulation waveform data. The instantiation and operation of the dumpvcd module, denoted as 'u_dumpvcd()', is how this block achieves its function. This block of code does not have any design complexity because it is simply invoking a system function for dumping VCD data."
