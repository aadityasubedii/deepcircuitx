    "block_comment": "This code block is a clock counter. It increments the 'clk_count' variable every positive edge (rising edge) of the system clock, thereby essentially keeping track of the number of clock cycles. It uses a non-blocking assignment to avoid any race conditions that could potentially occur in hardware."
