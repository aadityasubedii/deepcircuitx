    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a reset mechanism and a program starter in a synchronous hardware design. This is achieved through a combination of watching clock cycle (clk), configuration state (config_done), and a reset flag. At the beginning of each cycle, the code checks if reset is high, if so, it sets the program_start to a low state. Else, it checks if the configuration is done and if the program has not started yet. If both conditions are met, it sets specific address ('1000000') and triggers a sequence of rs setting and resetting. Finally, if data received (r_data) is high, it starts the program by setting program_start high."
