    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially including an external Verilog header file. The header file, `a25_functions.vh` contains definitions of user-defined functions, macros, or module declarations which are used in the current scope. The implementation uses Verilog\u2019s `` `include`` directive to include this file. The file path is relative, indicated by the `..` notation. So, it resides in a folder named \"include\" which is one level up from the current directory."
