    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code performs a display task to print out various system status information and register values. This is achieved by utilizing the Verilog `$display` system function to print out the status of specific status bits indicating the current operating mode ('User', 'FIRQ', 'IRQ', or 'SVC') as per the `U_EXECUTE.status_bits_mode` value. It further presents the contents of the register bank with each register's (`r0` to `r15`) value being output in hexadecimal format. Additionally, the status of the system flags like negative, zero, carry, overflow, IRQ, and FIRQ masks are also retrieved and displayed from the `U_EXECUTE.status_bits_flags` and `U_EXECUTE.status_bits_*mask` respectively."
