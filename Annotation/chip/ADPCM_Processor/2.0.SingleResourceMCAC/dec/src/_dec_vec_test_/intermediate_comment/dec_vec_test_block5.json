    "block_comment": "This block of hardware code is responsible for linking signal lines with the module named 'U_TEST_MODULE'. It relies on two assign statements, which are used to set up continuous assignments of values of the 'test_status_set' and 'test_status_reg' signals to the corresponding signals in 'U_TEST_MODULE'. The values of the signals in the given block will continually follow changes made to the defined signals in 'U_TEST_MODULE'."
