    "block_comment": "This is a synchronous counter and clock divider block implemented in Verilog. On an active edge of the clock signal (`clk`) or high level reset signal (`reset`), the block checks if `reset` is high, if so, it forces the `dec_s_clk` signal to zero and `ser_count` to 8'b00. If `reset` is low and `ser_count` is not 8'h3B, `ser_count` increments by one and `dec_s_clk` remains the same. When the `ser_count` becomes 8'h3B, it resets to 8'h00 and `dec_s_clk` is toggled. This block is primarily used to implement delay or frequency division by a factor of 8'h3B (59 in decimal)."
