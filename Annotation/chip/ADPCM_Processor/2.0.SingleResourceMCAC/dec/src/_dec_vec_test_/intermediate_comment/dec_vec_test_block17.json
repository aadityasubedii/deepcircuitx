    "block_comment": "This block of code configures data rates and laws and subsequently writes them across 32 channels. It first assigns binary values for different speed rates (\"40\", \"32\", \"24\", \"16\") to bits 2 and 1 of w_data. Then, it assigns a binary value to bit 0 of w_data according to different laws (\"AA\", \"MM\", \"AM\", \"MA\"). After setting the configuration, it enters a loop that counts through 32 channels (next_channel), setting a write strobe (ws), and then waiting for a clock cycle to turn off the strobe. With another clock edge, it proceeds to the next channel. After completely cycling through all channels, it indicates the completion by setting config_done to 1."
