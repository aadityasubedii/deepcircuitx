    "module": "Module-level comment: This 'Test' module provides a test environment for the decoder module, 'dec.' It uses input signals like 'reset,' 'clk,' scan inputs, 'scan_enable,' and 'test_mode' to regulate and initialize 'dec.' Results are extracted via 'scan_out' ports. An initial block sets the simulation environment. Presence of 'SDFSCAN' triggers SDF annotation for timing simulations. Unused signals 'clk_count' and 'testfail' are also declared."
