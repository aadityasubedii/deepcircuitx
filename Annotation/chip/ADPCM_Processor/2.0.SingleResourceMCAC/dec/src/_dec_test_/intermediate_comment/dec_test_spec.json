    "spec": "Module name: Test. \n\nModule specification: The 'Test' module is predominantly a test environment module focused on testing and debugging a decoder module named 'dec.' The primary functionality of this module is to initialize the 'dec' module with certain signals and parameters, enabling comprehensive testing under different conditions. \n\nThe input ports of the module include: reset, clk, scan_in0 through scan_in4, scan_enable, and test_mode. 'Reset' reverts the module to its initial state, and 'clk' provides synchronization. Scan inputs ('scan_in0' through 'scan_in4') are used for in-depth examination and potential fault detection within the 'dec' module. Both 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' serve as control signals that respectively enable scanning and put the module into test mode. \n\nOutputs of the module are 'scan_out0' through 'scan_out4.' These ports hold and provide the result data from the scanning process over the 'dec' module.\n\nInternally, signals are declared for purposes similar to their input counterparts - for example, 'clk' and 'reset' have the same roles. 'Clk_count' and 'testfail' are declared but unused. \n\nThe module is divided into different blocks. For instance, the instantiation block that sets up the 'dec' module with corresponding input-output associations and an initial block sets the time format and initializes all signals for the simulation. \n\nThe 'ifdef SDFSCAN' directive checks for the 'SDFSCAN' flag's presence, and if found, it will annotate the 'dec' module with SDF information for more accurate timing simulations. This 'Test' module is thus a systematic, functional approach for testing and annotating a decoder module in the simulation environment.",
