    "module": "Module-level comment: The dumpvcd module generates Value Change Dump (VCD) files for debugging purposes, which record signal value changes over time. No conventional I/O ports are present, instead it handles global definitions and signals. It uses internal signals including clock count, instruction execution, write operations, memory management, etc., which provide insights into the system's operation. The module consists of two main blocks: an initializer for the VCD dump and an always block for handling the dump start and stop based on clock count and macro definitions."
