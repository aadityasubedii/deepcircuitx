I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided Verilog code (`timescale 1ps / 1ps) is not a module but a directive used to define the time unit and time precision for the simulation. Therefore, it's impossible to generate a detailed specification including module name, functionality, input/output ports, and internal signals, as these components are not applicable for this code directive. The `timescale 1ps / 1ps directive simply indicates that the time unit and the time precision for the simulation are both 1 picosecond. In order to help generate detailed specification, I need a complete module of Verilog code.
