    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module is primarily a test bench for simulation, employing a CLK_GEN module with inputs for scan testing and modes. It initializes signals, sets the time format, and can employ SDF data for simulation. The testbench execution ends immediately after the setup, possibly indicating its role as a template or part of a larger system."
