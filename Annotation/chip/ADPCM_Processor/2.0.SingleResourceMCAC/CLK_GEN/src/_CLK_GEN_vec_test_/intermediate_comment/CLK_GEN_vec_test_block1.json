    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily performs initialization of the digital system in a simulation environment. It sets up the time format for the simulation output, and if the system is under SDF (Standard Delay Format) scan, it loads the appropriate SDF file for the top module of the test. Next, it sets the clock, reset signal, five scan inputs, the scan enable signal, and test mode to logic '0'. Once everything is established, the simulation completes with the \"$finish\" command."
