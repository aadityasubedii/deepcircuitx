    "spec": "Module name: CLK_GEN. \n\nModule specification: The CLK_GEN is a Verilog behavioural model designed to generate several clocks-critical signals for proper system operation. It generates a system clock, a serial clock, a frame synchronization signal, and a co-processor clock. It takes several input signals: a reset signal which resets the internal state when high, a main clock signal (clk), several inputs for testing purposes including scan chain test inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), a test mode, and a frame synchronization signal (i_frame_syn). This module outputs five scan outputs, a system clock, a serial clock, a frame synchronization signal, and a co-processor clock. \n\nInternally, CLK_GEN uses various signals to count clock cycles and select clock data. For example, ser_count, an 8-bit register, is used to count clock cycles for serial clock. In the same vein, co_count, a 4-bit register, is used for co-processor clock and fs_count, an 8-bit register, is used for frame sync signal. All the generated clock signals are buffered using each CLKBUFX4 elements then output to the system as required. \n\nThe module is logically divided into sections with each performing a unique role. One section is responsible for generating the serial clock, another the co-processor clock and another frame synchronization signal. Each of these sections is responsive to reset and clk signals, initializing and maintaining the states and counters of their respective clocks. They also handle test modes and provide synchronization based on various inputs and internal states. The module also includes logic that ensures proper synchronization based on the 'i_frame_syn' signal. It includes a detailed mechanism to handle flip-flop scanning inputs used in testing the module using the `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` inputs and `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` outputs. The scan enable and test mode inputs dictate the testing behaviour.",

The generation of these signals is influenced by a number of input parameters, including a reset signal, main clock signal (clk), test mode signal, frame synchronize input (i_frame_syn), and several scan enable inputs (present for testing purposes). The frequencies of generated clocks are derived from the main clock frequency by using internal counters (ser_count, co_count and fs_count). There is also logic that handles different test modes and provides synchronization based on the i_frame_syn signal.

                    "text": "Module name: CLK_GEN. \n\nModule specification: The CLK_GEN is a Verilog behavioural model designed to generate several clocks-critical signals for proper system operation. It generates a system clock, a serial clock, a frame synchronization signal, and a co-processor clock. It takes several input signals: a reset signal which resets the internal state when high, a main clock signal (clk), several inputs for testing purposes including scan chain test inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), a test mode, and a frame synchronization signal (i_frame_syn). This module outputs five scan outputs, a system clock, a serial clock, a frame synchronization signal, and a co-processor clock. \n\nInternally, CLK_GEN uses various signals to count clock cycles and select clock data. For example, ser_count, an 8-bit register, is used to count clock cycles for serial clock. In the same vein, co_count, a 4-bit register, is used for co-processor clock and fs_count, an 8-bit register, is used for frame sync signal. All the generated clock signals are buffered using each CLKBUFX4 elements then output to the system as required. \n\nThe module is logically divided into sections with each performing a unique role. One section is responsible for generating the serial clock, another the co-processor clock and another frame synchronization signal. Each of these sections is responsive to reset and clk signals, initializing and maintaining the states and counters of their respective clocks. They also handle test modes and provide synchronization based on various inputs and internal states. The module also includes logic that ensures proper synchronization based on the 'i_frame_syn' signal. It includes a detailed mechanism to handle flip-flop scanning inputs used in testing the module using the `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` inputs and `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` outputs. The scan enable and test mode inputs dictate the testing behaviour."
