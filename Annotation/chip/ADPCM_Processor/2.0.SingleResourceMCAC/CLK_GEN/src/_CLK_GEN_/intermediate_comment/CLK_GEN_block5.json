    "block_comment": "The described block of code is a counter clock generator with a reset functionality in Verilog. When the positive edge of the reset signal is detected, it initializes ser_clk to zero and sets ser_count to zero. Else, during each clock (clk) positive edge, it checks the value of ser_count and if it's not equal to '3B' (HEX), then it increments the counter (ser_count) and leaves ser_clk unchanged. However, if ser_count equals '3B', then it resets the counter to zero and inverts ser_clk to achieve a clock division."
