The generation of these signals is influenced by a number of input parameters, including a reset signal, main clock signal (clk), test mode signal, frame synchronize input (i_frame_syn), and several scan enable inputs (present for testing purposes). The frequencies of generated clocks are derived from the main clock frequency by using internal counters (ser_count, co_count and fs_count). There is also logic that handles different test modes and provides synchronization based on the i_frame_syn signal. All the clock signals are then buffered using CLKBUFX4 elements before being output from the module."
