    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls a multiplexer for sorting streams of sequential data, equipped with a reset functionality. It initiilses the multiplexer to a default state, by setting counters and flags to zero whenever a reset signal or a rising clock edge is detected. Afterwards, it either waits for the first frame sync, counts frame syncs, or augments the count and checks conditions. The variable \"fs_count\" keeps track of frame sync occurrences, while \"frame_syn\", \"first_fs\", \"last_fs\", and \"first_pass\" act as flags for synchronization tracking and control flow. Depending on whether it's the first synchronization or not, the first frame, the last one, or somewhere between the two, the circuit behaves differently, incrementing counters, setting or resetting flags. This helps in organising the incoming data stream and keeping the data processing tasks in order."
