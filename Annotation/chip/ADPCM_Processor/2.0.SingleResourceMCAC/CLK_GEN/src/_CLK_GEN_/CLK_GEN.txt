Module-level comment: The CLK_GEN module generates system, serial, synchronization, and co-processor clocks for a system. It takes a main clock and reset signals as inputs, and uses internal counters (ser_count, co_count, fs_count) and clock buffers to achieve clock generation. Input signals for scan chain testing are also processed and output. The module is sensitive to clk and reset inputs and changes operational modes based on test_mode input. The generated clocks are output via CLKBUFX4 buffers for system use. This module also compares frame synchronization input and uses logic to ensure its generation.
