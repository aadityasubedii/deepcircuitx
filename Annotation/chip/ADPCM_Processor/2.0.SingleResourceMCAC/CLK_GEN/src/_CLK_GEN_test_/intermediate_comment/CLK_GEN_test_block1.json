    "block_comment": "This block of code is typically used for frame synchronization error checking in a communication system. In each clock cycle, it checks whether the detected frame synchronization (o_frame_syn) is equal to the expected frame synchronization (exp_frame_syn). If there is a difference, it displays an error with a timestamp and immediately stops the simulation under ERRORSTOP compile condition. The checking starts only when the 'start_fs_check' flag is set. It repeats the process indefinitely making it suitable for continuous monitoring of incoming data."
