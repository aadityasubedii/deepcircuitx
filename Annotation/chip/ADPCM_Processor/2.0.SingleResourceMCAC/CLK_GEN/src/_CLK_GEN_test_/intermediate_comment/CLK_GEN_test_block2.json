    "block_comment": "The block of code primarily manages frame synchronization in a system, based on certain predefined conditions. Starting with initializing the frame sync check to 0, the block coordinates and adjusts frame synchronization operations. The process is carried out across multiple nested for loops with varying conditions for exp_k, exp_channel, and exp_bits. If exp_k becomes greater than 10, the frame synchronization (exp_frame_syn) is selectively set high or low based on the conditions of exp_channel and exp_bits, demonstrating the advanced control logic this block implements. All frame synchronizations occur at the positive edge of o_serial_clk, implying a clocked control system in play."
