    "module": "Module-level comment: \nThe 'test' module serves as a testbench for validating clock generation and synchronization in Verilog-based systems. It generates and tests system, serial, and co-processor clocks and a frame synchronization signal via several internal signals and flags. The test condition setup, clock generation, and the subsequent testing are done within initial blocks, using posedge clock event triggers. Errors are flagged and displayed when obtained clock periods deviate from the expected periods, or when the frame synchronization signal differs from the expected signal. The module employs scan-based testing strategy when operated in test mode."
