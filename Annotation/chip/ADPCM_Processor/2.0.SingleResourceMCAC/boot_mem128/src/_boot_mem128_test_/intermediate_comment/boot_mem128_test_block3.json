    "block_comment": "This block represents the initial test bench setup and data initiation part of a hardware design in Verilog. It begins by setting up a time format for simulation, conditions for SDF Annotation, and initializes certain bit variables to low (0) including clock (clk), reset, scan inputs, test mode and wishbone bus signals. After that, a positive and a negative edge detection on the clock signal is performed and the 'reset' signal is set to first high (1) and then low (0). Subsequently, it has two loops that continuous for 1024 times. In which two calls to wb_write_strobe and wb_read_strobe functions are made with dynamic arguments. At the end the block is terminated by $finish for simulation purposes."
