    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code performs a read operation on the Wishbone bus. It inputs an address, truth data, and a flag for checking truth. It sets the address line (i_wb_adr) to the input address, triggers the cycle (i_wb_cyc) and strobe (i_wb_stb) lines, but ensures that the write enable line (i_wb_we) is inactive, thereby indicating a read operation. Following clock cycles clear i_wb_cyc and i_wb_stb, facilitating the end of the read operation. If the check_for_truth flag is set, it compares the returned Wishbone data with the provided truth data. If the data differs, it throws an error and stops the execution if the ERRORSTOP flag is defined."
