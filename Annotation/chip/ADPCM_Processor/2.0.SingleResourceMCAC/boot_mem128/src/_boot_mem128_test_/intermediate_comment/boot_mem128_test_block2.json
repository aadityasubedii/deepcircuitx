    "block_comment": "This block defines a task for driving a write operation on the wishbone bus interface. On the rising edge of the clock, it takes an address and data as input to perform the write operation by activating the cycle, strobe, and write enable control signals while simultaneously feeding the interface with address and data. On the next clock tick, it deactivates the control signals, marking the end of the write operation."
