    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module initializes and tests a memory block \"boot_mem128\" using the Wishbone bus signal interface. It begins with clock signals and resets initialization, followed by setting up inputs and Wishbone signals. The write and read operations are performed via tasks 'wb_write_strobe' and 'wb_read_strobe', resulting in them checking for any data mismatch during the read operations. If there are discrepancies, error messages will be displayed. The module eventually closes the ongoing cycles and strobe signals. It appears to act as a testbench for verifying the 'boot_mem128' memory block operation.\n\nInput Ports: The 'test' module accepts inputs through the ports 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', 'test_mode', 'i_wb_adr', 'i_wb_sel', 'i_wb_we', 'i_wb_dat', 'i_wb_cyc', and 'i_wb_stb'. The first set of ports is involved in scan testing and the exact functionalities have not been specified. The 'i_wb' prefixed ports accommodate the Wishbone bus signals for memory address, selected byte, write enable, data transfer, cycle, and strobe signals respectively.\n\nOutput Ports: The outputs are 'scan_out0' through 'scan_out4', 'o_wb_dat', 'o_wb_ack', 'o_wb_err'. The first set of ports output the results from scan testing and their specific roles aren't clearly established in the code. The 'o_wb' prefixed ports are part of the Wishbone bus interface and are used for outputting read data, operation acknowledgement, and error reporting signals.\n\nInternal Signals: The internal signals like 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', 'test_mode', 'i_wb_adr', 'i_wb_sel', 'i_wb_we', 'i_wb_dat', 'i_wb_cyc', and 'i_wb_stb', serve for timing, initiating a known state in the system, controlling scan testing, and implementing memory read/write operation functionality via the Wishbone bus interface.\n\nSections of Code: The 'test' module calls the 'boot_mem128' block with defined input and output signals. It comprises an 'initial' block that initiates the test's starting state by setting the values of the signals, and two loops with write and read strobes operations. It features two tasks, 'wb_write_strobe' for writing data into the memory and 'wb_read_strobe' for reading data from the memory and checking the correctness. If any mismatches occur in the returned data, it will report error messages.",

                    "text": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module initializes and tests a memory block \"boot_mem128\" using the Wishbone bus signal interface. It begins with clock signals and resets initialization, followed by setting up inputs and Wishbone signals. The write and read operations are performed via tasks 'wb_write_strobe' and 'wb_read_strobe', resulting in them checking for any data mismatch during the read operations. If there are discrepancies, error messages will be displayed. The module eventually closes the ongoing cycles and strobe signals. It appears to act as a testbench for verifying the 'boot_mem128' memory block operation.\n\nInput Ports: The 'test' module accepts inputs through the ports 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', 'test_mode', 'i_wb_adr', 'i_wb_sel', 'i_wb_we', 'i_wb_dat', 'i_wb_cyc', and 'i_wb_stb'. The first set of ports is involved in scan testing and the exact functionalities have not been specified. The 'i_wb' prefixed ports accommodate the Wishbone bus signals for memory address, selected byte, write enable, data transfer, cycle, and strobe signals respectively.\n\nOutput Ports: The outputs are 'scan_out0' through 'scan_out4', 'o_wb_dat', 'o_wb_ack', 'o_wb_err'. The first set of ports output the results from scan testing and their specific roles aren't clearly established in the code. The 'o_wb' prefixed ports are part of the Wishbone bus interface and are used for outputting read data, operation acknowledgement, and error reporting signals.\n\nInternal Signals: The internal signals like 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', 'test_mode', 'i_wb_adr', 'i_wb_sel', 'i_wb_we', 'i_wb_dat', 'i_wb_cyc', and 'i_wb_stb', serve for timing, initiating a known state in the system, controlling scan testing, and implementing memory read/write operation functionality via the Wishbone bus interface.\n\nSections of Code: The 'test' module calls the 'boot_mem128' block with defined input and output signals. It comprises an 'initial' block that initiates the test's starting state by setting the values of the signals, and two loops with write and read strobes operations. It features two tasks, 'wb_write_strobe' for writing data into the memory and 'wb_read_strobe' for reading data from the memory and checking the correctness. If any mismatches occur in the returned data, it will report error messages."
