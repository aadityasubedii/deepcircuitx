    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module is a testbench for verifying the operation of the 'boot_mem128' memory block. The module employs scan test and the Wishbone bus interface via a set of inputs/outputs and internal signals like 'clk', 'reset', 'wb_adr', 'wb_sel', and 'wb_dat'. The code includes an initial block that defines starting states, and loops to trigger the 'wb_write_strobe' and 'wb_read_strobe' tasks for testing write/read operations. Errors are reported if returned and expected data do not match. This module facilitates the functional testing of 'boot_mem128'."
