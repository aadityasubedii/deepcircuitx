    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a test bench to ascertain the performance of a 'boot_mem128' module. It uses input ports 'clk' and 'reset' for synchronization, 'scan_in[0-4]' for injecting test patterns, and 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' for controlling the test procedure. Outputs 'scan_out[0-4]' capture the system's responses. The 'boot_mem128' module is instantiated with these signals. All signals are initialized in the 'initial' block, with event-based simulation termination initiated by '$finish'."
