    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module functions as a test bench designed to configure and assess the functionality of a secondary module named 'boot_mem128', which is instantiated within the test module. This design incorporates scan chains (scan_in0 to scan_in4), used predominantly for executing built-in self-testing and chip assessment in the industry, specifically when the Design For Test (DFT) methodology is employed. The control signal 'scan_enable' activates these scan chains, and another signal 'test_mode' potentially modifies the operational mode of 'boot_mem128'. The 'reset' and 'clk' signals likely facilitate synchronization in the operation of the 'boot_mem128' module. The test module is designed to observe the scan chain outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4). \n\nThe input ports are 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'. 'clk' is the clock signal responsible for synchronizing operations in digital circuits. 'reset' provides a reset signal, establishing the system in an initial state. The 'scan_in' set of signals (from 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4') are used for inputting test patterns, with 'scan_enable' acting as an enabling signal that controls their activation. The 'test_mode' signal shifts the system's operational state between a standard functional mode and a test mode.\n\nThe output ports are 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' which capture the system's responses to the inputted test patterns via the corresponding scan chains. These responses, after analysis, would determine whether the system is functioning correctly. All the external inputs and outputs are also used as internal signals having the same functionality inside this 'test' module.\n\nThe code predominantly consists of declaring signals, instantiation of the 'boot_mem128' module, and initializing signal values. The sections `$timeformat` and `$sdf_annotate` are dedicated to setting the time format and annotating the design with delay information, respectively. Upon reaching a certain condition denoted in this caso by $finish, the simulation terminates.",
