Module-level comment: 

The boot_mem128 module serves as a memory interface for a boot system using the Wishbone protocol. It supports both read and write functions and includes a debugging feature enabled by the AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG directive. It operates using numerous input and output ports and internal signals to initiate and conduct memory operations. The Verilog code is designed to adapt based on `verilog and AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG flags, and it handles memory instantiation differently depending on these directives. This flexibility enables the module to adjust its functionality for different environments.
