Comment: 
This Verilog block is assigning the input wire 'i_wb_dat' to the wire 'write_data'. This assignment operation happens continuously, which means whenever there is a change in the value of 'i_wb_dat', it's new value will be propagated to 'write_data'. Thus, 'write_data' gets its data directly from 'i_wb_dat'.
