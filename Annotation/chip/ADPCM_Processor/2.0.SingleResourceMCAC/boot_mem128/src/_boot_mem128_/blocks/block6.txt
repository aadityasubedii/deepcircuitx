Comment: 
The code block assigns a value to the output wire 'o_wb_ack'. This is done via the logical AND operation on the input wire 'i_wb_stb' and a logical OR operation on 'start_write' and 'start_read_r'. So 'o_wb_ack' will be asserted if there's a read or write operation (denoted by 'start_write' or 'start_read_r') and if there's a valid data strobe input (marked by 'i_wb_stb').
