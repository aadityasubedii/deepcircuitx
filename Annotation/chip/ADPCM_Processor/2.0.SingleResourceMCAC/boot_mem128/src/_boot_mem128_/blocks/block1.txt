This block of Verilog code is designed to display an initialization message on the console. The initialization stage involves displaying a string message, with particular emphasis on the boot memory file in use. It calls `$display()` system function in "initial" block, which occurs at time 0 or at the start of simulation, and outputs the formatted string that mentions the boot memory file's name, which is fetched from the macro `BOOT_MEM128_PARAMS_FILE`. Use of the `endif` preprocessor directive suggests that condition-based compilation or inclusion of code-font has been used here. Note, the endmodule keyword indicates the end of the module.
