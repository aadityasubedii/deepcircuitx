Comment: 
This block of Verilog code's function is to assign the value of the "read_data" signal to the output wire "o_wb_dat". The assignment is carried out using a continuous assignment statement, denoted by the keyword "assign". The value of "o_wb_dat" will reflect the value of "read_data" at any point in time, meaning that whenever "read_data" changes, the change is immediately reflected in "o_wb_dat". This forms a critical part of data read functionality as it allows the system to pass the data read from memory or a register to other parts of the digital circuit through the wire "o_wb_dat".
