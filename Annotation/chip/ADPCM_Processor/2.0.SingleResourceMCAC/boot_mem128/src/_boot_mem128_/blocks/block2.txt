Comment: 
The block of code represents an instantiation of a generic synchronous static RAM with byte enable. The SRAM is parameterized by data width and address width, passed as `WB_DWIDTH` and `MADDR_WIDTH` respectively. The SRAM is controlled by signals including clock, reset, scan_enable and test_mode. Writing to the SRAM is enabled by the signal `start_write` and determined by `byte_enable` and the address is passed by the `address` signal. The data written into the SRAM is from the `write_data` signal, and the data read out from the SRAM is passed to the `read_data` signal.
