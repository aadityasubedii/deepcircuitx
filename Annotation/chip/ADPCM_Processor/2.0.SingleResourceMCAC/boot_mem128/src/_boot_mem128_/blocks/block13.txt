This block of code is responsible for controlling the reading start of a circuit. It implements this functionality by depending on a rising edge triggered process. This logic block resets the "start_read_r" signal whenever there's a positive edge on the "reset" signal. Alternatively, it assigns the value of the "start_read" signal to "start_read_r" whenever there's a positive edge detected on the "clock" signal and no reset occurs.
