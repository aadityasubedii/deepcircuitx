The block of code assigns the value of the input wire i_wb_sel to the output wire byte_enable. This is achieved using the assign statement in Verilog. The assign statement allows a continuous assignment which means the output wire byte_enable will take the value of i_wb_sel wire whenever it changes. It's a simple wire assignment in a one-line block of Verilog RTL code.
