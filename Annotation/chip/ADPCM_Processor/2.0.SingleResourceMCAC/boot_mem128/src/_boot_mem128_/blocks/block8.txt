This code block is assigning a portion of the wire `i_wb_adr` to the `address` wire. By using the bit-wise slicing from `MADDR_WIDTH+3` to `4`, it effectively selects a sub range from the `i_wb_adr` wire, copying that value into the `address` wire. This can be used for address decoding or similar tasks where only a part of the total address line is required.
