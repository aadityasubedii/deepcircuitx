Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for generating a clock signal. The signal frequency is determined by the designated `CLK_PERIOD` macro, which gets divided by two (as fully-formed clock pulse consists of two half-periods - one up, one down) and hence produces a square wave clock signal. This simulated clock is repeatedly inverted from its current state every half period thereby assuring a continuous clock signal for synchronous digital designs.
