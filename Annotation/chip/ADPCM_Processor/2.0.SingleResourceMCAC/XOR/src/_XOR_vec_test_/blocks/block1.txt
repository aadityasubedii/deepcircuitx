This block is an initial test bench for a set of models under various conditions. The testing is done by iteratively reading model vectors from external files based on different parameters; there are five nested for-loops, each iterating over possible configurations. Inside the innermost loop, for each vector, it loads, displays, and checks the expected and actual results. If the captured output mismatches the expected result, an error message is displayed. After all iterations are complete, it displays a 'TEST COMPLETE' message and halts the simulation. As a part of the block, the macro definitions (`ifdef`) allow the optionality of certain features within the test, including SDF annotation, verbose output display, and stopping execution on error.
