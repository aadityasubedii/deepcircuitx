    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily initializes various string arrays. These arrays - 'rates', 'laws', 'operations', 'types', 'models' store particular preset strings. The initialization is carried out inside an 'initial' block, hence, it occurs once at the simulation start or whenever the module containing this block is paced in reset. Each array is indexed explicitly, ensuring that each respective array value is set to the corresponding string literal."
