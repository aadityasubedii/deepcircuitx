    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module functions as a testbench for the 'XOR' module, providing scan inputs and receiving scan outputs. It uses an external clock, reset signal, a test mode and a scan enable mode. Internally, it connects three signals to the 'XOR' module (DQ, DQn, Un), with DQ and DQn as registers and Un as a wire. A repetitive block generates the clock signal and an 'initial' block sets initial values and finalizes the test."
