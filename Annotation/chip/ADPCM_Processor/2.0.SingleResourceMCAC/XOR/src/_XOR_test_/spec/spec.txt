Module name: test. 

Module specification: The 'test' module is a Verilog module primarily designed to test another module , 'XOR', with various scan inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`) and corresponding scan outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`). The test module uses an external clock signal (`clk`) and has a reset functionality (`reset`). Its operation can be extended to a test mode by the `test_mode` line or can be bypassed by using the `scan_enable` line. In the internal design, there are three signals (`DQ`, `DQn`, `Un`) that are connected to the 'XOR' module, however their precise functionality is determined by the 'XOR' module's design which is not provided in the current code. `DQ` is a 16-bit register and `DQn` is an 11-bit register while `Un` is a wire signal. The test module is organized in a straightforward way as a standalone system for testing purposes. A significant part of the code is dedicated to the initialization of parameters and signals. The clock signal is generated internally in a repetitive control block and the specification for the duration of each clock period is provided by the `CLK_PERIOD` constant. The initial value settings for all the input lines and the termination of the test is provisioned in an 'initial' block.
