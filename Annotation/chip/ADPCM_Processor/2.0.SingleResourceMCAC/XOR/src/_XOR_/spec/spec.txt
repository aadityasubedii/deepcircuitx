Module name: XOR. 

Module specification: The XOR module implements a XOR operation, primarily designed for testing scenarios, especially with its scan chain and test inputs. It comprises of two parts - the input and output port definitions, and the main always block that implements the XOR operation. The input ports include 'reset' and 'clk' for general system operations, 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' and 'scan_enable' for scan chain testing, 'test_mode' for switching into the module's test state, and 'DQ' and 'DQn' acting as 16-bit and 11-bit inputs respectively to the XOR gate. The output ports contain 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' as output data from the scan chain and 'Un' that represents the output of the XOR operation. The internal signals 'DQS' and 'DQnS' store the most significant bits of the inputs 'DQ' and 'DQn' respectively. They feed into the XOR operation whose result is stored in 'Un'. The main 'always' block triggers with changes in 'DQ' or 'DQn', assigning the most significant bits of these two signals to 'DQS' and 'DQnS' respectively, and carrying out the XOR action with the result assigned to 'Un'.
