    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, XOR, performs an XOR operation primarily for testing procedures. Input ports 'DQ' (16-bit) and 'DQn' (11-bit) feed into the XOR operation with the MSBs stored in internal signals 'DQS' and 'DQnS'. The XOR result is captured in output 'Un'. Other inputs and outputs are for scan chain testing controlled by 'test_mode'. The XOR operation is performed in an 'always' block that triggers on changes in 'DQ' or 'DQn'."
