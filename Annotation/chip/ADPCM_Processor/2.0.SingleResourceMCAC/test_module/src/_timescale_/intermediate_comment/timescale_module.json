    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog code snippet does not define a module; it only contains a `timescale directive, which sets the time unit and precision to 1 nanosecond for the subsequent modules in the same file. This directive indirectly influences the interpretation of time and delay measurements in those modules. No functional details or implementation can be described from this snippet alone. More comprehensive code is needed to provide a detailed module-level comment."
