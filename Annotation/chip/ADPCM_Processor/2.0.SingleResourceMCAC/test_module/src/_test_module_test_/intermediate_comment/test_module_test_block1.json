    "block_comment": "This block of code describes the initial setup for a test environment of a specific hardware module, with specific conditions for testing using scan chains. It timestamps the testing execution time in nanoseconds accuracy, and provides an option for Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotation based on a defined condition 'SDFSCAN', which is useful for interfacing with circuit simulation tools. Simultaneously, it initializes the clock, reset signals, and all scanning inputs to logic '0', specifying an idle state for the test environment. Additionally, it sets the scan_enable and test_mode conditions to their inactive states. Once the setup is complete, the test environment execution halts with the '$finish' command."
