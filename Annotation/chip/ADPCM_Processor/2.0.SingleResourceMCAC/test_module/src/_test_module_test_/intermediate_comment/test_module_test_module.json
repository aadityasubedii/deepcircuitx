    "module": "Module-level comment: This is the 'test' module which acts as a testbench for 'test_module'. It initializes a test environment by setting the time format, applying the optional SDF delay annotation, and setting all input signals ('clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode') to zero. It then conducts tests on the 'test_module', providing these input signals and retrieving the test results through output signals ('scan_out0' to 'scan_out4')."
