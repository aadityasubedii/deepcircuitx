Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for a module named 'test_module'. The purpose of this module is to initialize a test environment for the 'test_module', wherein it sets the time format for test logs, optionally applies the SDF delay annotation file, and initializes all the input signals to zero i.e., 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'. The module takes in several input ports including 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', 'test_mode' which are used to control the operation of the 'test_module'. Output of the 'test_module' is collected through 'scan_out0' through 'scan_out4' which represent the results of the scan operation conducted within the 'test_module'. There are no internal signals used within this module. The initial block in this module sets all the input signals to zero and also includes a block for SDF annotation, this is activated conditionally at compile time if the user has defined 'SDFSCAN'. This module acts as both the stimuli generator and response checker for the 'test_module'.
