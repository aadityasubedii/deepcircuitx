    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to handle a counter register, `cycles_reg`. The counter either resets to 0 when the `reset` signal is detected or increments by one at every rising edge of the `clk` (clock) signal. The operation and the increment of the counter happen asynchronously, responding immediately to changes in either the `reset` or `clk` inputs."
