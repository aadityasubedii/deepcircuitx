    "block_comment": "This Verilog block of code represents a synchronous system for generating and updating a pseudo-random number. The system starts working at either a rising edge of a clock signal (clk) or a reset signal being high. If the reset signal is active, the value of the 8-bit output 'random_num' is initialized to hexadecimal 'f3'. However, during the normal operation (when reset is not high), the logic interacts with a Wishbone bus interface to perform a write or read operation on the 'random_num' when the 'wb_start_write' or 'wb_start_read' signals are high respectively, and the Wishbone address 'i_wb_adr' matches the register address designated by 'AMBER_TEST_RANDOM_NUM'. For a write operation, a new 8-bit value from 'wb_wdata32' is assigned to 'random_num'. In the case of a read operation, a new pseudo-random 8-bit value is generated based on a specific feedback shift logic that uses preset bits in 'random_num'."
