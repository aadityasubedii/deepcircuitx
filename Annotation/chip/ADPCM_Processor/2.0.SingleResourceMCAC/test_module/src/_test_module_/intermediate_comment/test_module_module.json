    "module": "Module-level comment: 'test_module' serves as a versatile testing and diagnostic unit for a memory controller and peripheral system. It utilizes the Wishbone bus protocol to manage tasks like register read/write operations, UART communication, system control and timer functionalities. Its operation relies on numerous input and output ports, as well as various control and status registers. Additionally, it manages interrupt timers, random number generation, test status, cycle counters, and physical resets. The logic and functionality are achieved through different \"always\" blocks for signal assignments and transaction management, complemented by a \"generate\" construct for output data adaptation based on Wishbone data width."
