    "spec": "Module name: test_module. \n\nModule specification: The test_module is a multi-functional unit that manages various tasks in a memory controller and peripheral system, most notably operating testing and diagnostic functionalities in line with hardware production and system-level test benches. The module operates under the Wishbone bus protocol, enabling data reading and writing to registers, UART communication, system control, timer functionalities, LED control, and test modes. Specific test components are addressed using defined register addresses. \n\nInput Ports: This module needs several inputs: a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (reset), five inputs for scan values (scan_in0 to scan_in4), an enable signal for the scanning process (scan_enable), and a test mode signal (test_mode). Furthermore, it requires a 32-bit Wishbone address bus for read/write operations (i_wb_adr), a 16-bit input for Wishbone transaction (i_wb_sel), a Wishbone write-enable signal (i_wb_we), a variable width Wishbone data bus for data input (i_wb_dat), and signals indicating active bus cycle and strobes during valid data transfer (i_wb_cyc, i_wb_stb).\n\nOutput Ports: The module encompasses multiple outputs as scan results (scan_out0 to scan_out4), interrupt requests (o_irq & o_firq), memory control (o_mem_ctrl), a variable width Wishbone data bus for output data (o_wb_dat), acknowledgements and error signals for the read/write process of the Wishbone bus protocol(o_wb_ack,o_wb_err), a 4-bit output for driving status lights (o_led), and a physical reset output (o_phy_rst_n).\n\nInternal signals: The module operates with several important internal signals including 8-bit registers for different timers and a random number (firq_timer, irq_timer, random_num), various register widths for controls, status, and hold of UART transmission data (tb_uart_control_reg, tb_uart_status_reg, tb_uart_push, tb_uart_txd_reg), 3-bit simulation control register, a signal for memory control, 32-bit test status register and a signal for setting statuses (sim_ctrl_reg, mem_ctrl_reg, test_status_reg, test_status_set), 32-bit register for counting system clock cycles (cycles_reg), initiation signals for read and write operations (wb_start_write, wb_start_read, wb_start_read_d1), 32-bit registers for reading and writing on the Wishbone bus (wb_rdata32, wb_wdata32), 4-bit register for LED control (led_reg) and a signal for physical reset (phy_rst_reg).\n\nCode Blocks: The Verilog RTL code for test_module includes various behavioral \"always\" blocks for signal assignment, memory control, testing process, testing status, interrupt, system clock cycles, LED control, physical reset, lighting control, and UART transmission. The \"generate\" construct modifies outputs according to the Wishbone data width. Each block serves a unique purpose in system-level test bench for debugging or production/testing of hardware.",

The module operates under the Wishbone bus protocol, enabling data reading and writing to registers, UART communication, system control, timer functionalities, LED control, and test modes. Specific test components are addressed using defined register addresses. \n\nInput Ports: This module needs several inputs: a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (reset), five inputs for scan values (scan_in0 to scan_in4), an enable signal for the scanning process (scan_enable), and a test mode signal (test_mode). Furthermore, it requires a 32-bit Wishbone address bus for read/write operations (i_wb_adr), a 16-bit input for Wishbone transaction (i_wb_sel), a Wishbone write-enable signal (i_wb_we), a variable width Wishbone data bus for data input (i_wb_dat), and signals indicating active bus cycle and strobes during valid data transfer (i_wb_cyc, i_wb_stb).\n\nOutput Ports: The module encompasses multiple outputs as scan results (scan_out0 to scan_out4), interrupt requests (o_irq & o_firq), memory control (o_mem_ctrl), a variable width Wishbone data bus for output data (o_wb_dat), acknowledgements and error signals for the read/write process of the Wishbone bus protocol(o_wb_ack,o_wb_err), a 4-bit output for driving status lights (o_led), and a physical reset output (o_phy_rst_n).\n\nInternal signals: The module operates with several important internal signals including 8-bit registers for different timers and a random number (firq_timer, irq_timer, random_num), various register widths for controls, status, and hold of UART transmission data (tb_uart_control_reg, tb_uart_status_reg, tb_uart_push, tb_uart_txd_reg), 3-bit simulation control register, a signal for memory control, 32-bit test status register and a signal for setting statuses (sim_ctrl_reg, mem_ctrl_reg, test_status_reg, test_status_set), 32-bit register for counting system clock cycles (cycles_reg), initiation signals for read and write operations (wb_start_write, wb_start_read, wb_start_read_d1), 32-bit registers for reading and writing on the Wishbone bus (wb_rdata32, wb_wdata32), 4-bit register for LED control (led_reg) and a signal for physical reset (phy_rst_reg).\n\nCode Blocks: The Verilog RTL code for test_module includes various behavioral \"always\" blocks for signal assignment, memory control, testing process, testing status, interrupt, system clock cycles, LED control, physical reset, lighting control, and UART transmission. The \"generate\" construct modifies outputs according to the Wishbone data width. Each block serves a unique purpose in system-level test bench for debugging or production/testing of hardware."

The module operates under the Wishbone bus protocol, enabling data reading and writing to registers, UART communication, system control, timer functionalities, LED control, and test modes. Specific test components are addressed using defined register addresses. \n\nInput Ports: This module needs several inputs: a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (reset), five inputs for scan values (scan_in0 to scan_in4), an enable signal for the scanning process (scan_enable), and a test mode signal (test_mode). Furthermore, it requires a 32-bit Wishbone address bus for read/write operations (i_wb_adr), a 16-bit input for Wishbone transaction (i_wb_sel), a Wishbone write-enable signal (i_wb_we), a variable width Wishbone data bus for data input (i_wb_dat), and signals indicating active bus cycle and strobes during valid data transfer (i_wb_cyc, i_wb_stb).\n\nOutput Ports: The module encompasses multiple outputs as scan results (scan_out0 to scan_out4), interrupt requests (o_irq & o_firq), memory control (o_mem_ctrl), a variable width Wishbone data bus for output data (o_wb_dat), acknowledgements and error signals for the read/write process of the Wishbone bus protocol(o_wb_ack,o_wb_err), a 4-bit output for driving status lights (o_led), and a physical reset output (o_phy_rst_n).\n\nInternal signals: The module operates with several important internal signals including 8-bit registers for different timers and a random number (firq_timer, irq_timer, random_num), various register widths for controls, status, and hold of UART transmission data (tb_uart_control_reg, tb_uart_status_reg, tb_uart_push, tb_uart_txd_reg), 3-bit simulation control register, a signal for memory control, 32-bit test status register and a signal for setting statuses (sim_ctrl_reg, mem_ctrl_reg, test_status_reg, test_status_set), 32-bit register for counting system clock cycles (cycles_reg), initiation signals for read and write operations (wb_start_write, wb_start_read, wb_start_read_d1), 32-bit registers for reading and writing on the Wishbone bus (wb_rdata32, wb_wdata32), 4-bit register for LED control (led_reg) and a signal for physical reset (phy_rst_reg).\n\nCode Blocks: The Verilog RTL code for test_module includes various behavioral \"always\" blocks for signal assignment, memory control, testing process, testing status, interrupt, system clock cycles, LED control, physical reset, lighting control, and UART transmission. The \"generate\" construct modifies outputs according to the Wishbone data width. Each block serves a unique purpose in system-level test bench for debugging or production/testing of hardware."
