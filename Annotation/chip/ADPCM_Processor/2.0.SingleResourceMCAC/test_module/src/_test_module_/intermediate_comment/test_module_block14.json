    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating the value of the 'wb_rdata32' register based on different conditions. Acting upon either the positive edge of reset or clock, the code block sets 'wb_rdata32' to 0 if reset is active. However, if a read operation is initiated, the specific value 'wb_rdata32' takes on is determined via a case statement depending upon the 16 least significant bits of 'i_wb_adr'. This includes both specific test status signals such as 'test_status_reg', 'firq_timer', 'irq_timer' etc., as well as a default value in case none of the conditions are satisfied."
