    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to handle timer routines for a first-in-first-out (FIFO) interrupt queue. On the rising edge of a reset or clock cycle, the operations within the block are executed. The reset condition sets the firq_timer to zero. However, in the absence of a reset signal, two main operational conditions exist: 1) If a write to the AMBER_TEST_FIRQ_TIMER address is initiated by the Wishbone bus control (`wb_start_write` is true) then the firq_timer gets the lower 8 bits of the Wishbone data bus (`wb_wdata32[7:0]`). 2) Otherwise, as long as firq_timer is greater than 1, it decrements itself by 1 in each clock cycle. This handling of the firq_timer helps in managing timed operations and interrupts within the hardware module."
