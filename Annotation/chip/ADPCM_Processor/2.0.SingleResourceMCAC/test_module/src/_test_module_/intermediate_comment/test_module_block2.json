    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is responsible for managing the reset function of a certain physical entity (potentially a test module named AMBER_TEST_PHY_RST). Within the block, there's a sensitivity to both positive edges of reset and clk signals. When a reset signal is high, 'phy_rst_reg' (presumably a physical reset register) is set back to the default value 0, indicating the initiation of a reset. Alternatively, when the 'wb_start_write' signal is high and the lower 16 bits of the 'i_wb_adr' address equals to AMBER_TEST_PHY_RST, it means a write operation to the physical reset register is enacted with data from the least significant bit of 'wb_wdata32'."
