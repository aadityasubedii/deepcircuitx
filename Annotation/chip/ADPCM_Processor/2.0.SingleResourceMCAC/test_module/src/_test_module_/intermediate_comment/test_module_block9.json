    "block_comment": "The block manages the 'irq_timer' register, which is involved in handling interrupt requests based on a timer. It operates synchronously with the 'reset' and 'clk' signals. Initially, when 'reset' is high, 'irq_timer' is cleared. Otherwise, when 'wb_start_write' is asserted and the address corresponds to 'AMBER_TEST_IRQ_TIMER', the bottom byte of 'wb_wdata32' is loaded into 'irq_timer'. If none of these conditions is met, but 'irq_timer' is more than 1, it is decremented by 1."
