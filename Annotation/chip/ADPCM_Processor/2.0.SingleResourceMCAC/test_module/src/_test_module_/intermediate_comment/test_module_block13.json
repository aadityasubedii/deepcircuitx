    "block_comment": "This block is a clocked process that handles the reset and updating of the `sim_ctrl_reg` register. When a positive edge of the `reset` signal occurs, it sets the `sim_ctrl_reg` to a default value of binary 000. On the occurrence of clock `clk` positive edge and no reset, the `sim_ctrl_reg` register is updated with the value from the `AMBER_SIM_CTRL` macro."
