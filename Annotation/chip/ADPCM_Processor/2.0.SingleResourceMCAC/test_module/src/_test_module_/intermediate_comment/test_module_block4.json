    "block_comment": "The code block controls memory access in a Verilog design. At each positive edge of reset or clock signal, the block verifies if a reset has been issued and, if true, resets the memory control register to zero. In absence of a reset, the block checks if a write operation is being initiated with the address equal to the constant AMBER_TEST_MEM_CTRL. If these conditions are met, the first bit of the write-data is then loaded to the memory control register."
