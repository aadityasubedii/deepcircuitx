This block functions as a register update mechanism under certain conditions. It is triggered on the rising edge of either 'reset' or 'clk' signals. In the event of a reset signal, the 'test_status_reg' register is reset to 0. If the system isn't in a reset state, instead on the detection of a 'wb_start_write' signal and when the lower 16 bits of 'i_wb_adr' match the AMBER_TEST_STATUS, the 'test_status_reg' register is updated with the value of 'wb_wdata32' coming from the Wishbone write data.
