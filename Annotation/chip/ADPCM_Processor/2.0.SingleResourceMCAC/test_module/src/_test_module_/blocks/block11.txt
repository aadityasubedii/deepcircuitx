The block of code assigns the `o_firq` output to the result of a comparison between `firq_timer` and `8'd1`. This operation essentially checks if the `firq_timer` variable has a value of `1`, setting the output `o_firq` to `true` if this condition is met, and `false` otherwise. Hence, this block functions as a simple, single-bit equality checker. It achieves this through the use of the `assign` keyword and the equality operator, ensuring an immediate update of `o_firq` whenever the value of `firq_timer` changes.
