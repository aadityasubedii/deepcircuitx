This block of code handles the reset and clock signals for the wire wb_start_read_d1 in the circuit. When a positive edge of the reset is detected, wb_start_read_d1 is reset to 0. However, if the clock signal posedge clk occurs, the current state of the wb_start_read (which isn't shown) becomes the next state of wb_start_read_d1. This could potentially be a part of the implementation of a flip flop or a part of a more complex Finite State Machine (FSM).
