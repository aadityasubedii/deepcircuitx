This is a language-conditioned data assignment block of a Verilog RTL. It utilizes the generate and conditional if statements to manage data width. With a data width (WB_DWIDTH) of 128, data from the input bus (i_wb_dat) is sectioned into four 32-bit segments (wb_wdata32), with the selection depending on the lower two bits of the address signal (i_wb_adr). Conversely, for 32-bit width, the entire data input (i_wb_dat) is assigned to (wb_wdata32). The output data (o_wb_dat) is also assigned based on the data width.
