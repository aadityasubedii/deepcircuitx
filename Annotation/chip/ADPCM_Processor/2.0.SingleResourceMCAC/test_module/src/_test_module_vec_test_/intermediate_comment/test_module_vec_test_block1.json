    "block_comment": "This block initializes simulation parameters and states for the test environment. It starts by setting the time format for the simulation time to be displayed in nanoseconds with 2 decimal point precision. If the module is compiled with SDFSCAN defined, it applies the specified SDF annotations to test.top. Then, it initializes all the signals, namely clk, reset, scan_in{0:4}, scan_enable, and test_mode, to a logic '0'. Finally, it calls $finish to stop the simulation after the initial block completes."
