Module-level comment: This 'test' module operates as a testbench for 'test_module', initializing all inputs to zero and using Standard Delay Format for precise timing if 'SDFSCAN' is defined. Its inputs include 'clk', 'reset', five 'scan_in' signals, 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode', and it outputs the result of the scan test through five 'scan_out' signals. The 'test_module' is tested under controlled conditions potentially involving precise timing based on whether 'SDFSCAN' is defined.
