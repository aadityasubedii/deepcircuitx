Module name: test. 

Module specification: The 'test' module serves as a test bench for a module named 'test_module', testing its functionality and behavior under specific conditions. The 'test' module's input ports include the clock signal 'clk', a reset signal 'reset', five input data signals 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', a control signal 'scan_enable' to enable scan testing, and a 'test_mode' signal to specify the testing mode. The output ports of this module comprise five output signals 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', which enable the extraction of data from the scan chain in the 'test_module'. Internal to this module are similar signals used for enabling the orderly execution of 'test_module'. Within the initial block, this module applies to 'test_module' a known state of zero for all input signals and uses either a standard delay format or an immediate termination of operation, depending on whether 'SDFSCAN' is defined in the project. All these reflect the ability of this testbench to set up, execute, and analyze 'test_module' under controlled conditions and specified timings.
