Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls the 'force_bl1' signal based on several conditions involving output address, buffer block, end address input, system reset input, and available buffer. Upon system reset, 'force_bl1' is cleared to low immediately. Besides, when the product of output address and buffer block (scaled down by data width) crosses the end address input, or simultaneously if system mode is "Read" and available buffer drops to 50 or less, 'force_bl1' is set to high. For any other scenario, 'force_bl1' is kept low.
