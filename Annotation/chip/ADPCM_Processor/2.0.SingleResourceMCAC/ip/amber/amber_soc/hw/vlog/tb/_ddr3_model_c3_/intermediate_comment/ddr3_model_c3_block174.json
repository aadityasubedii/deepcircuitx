    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a clock enable (cke_in) signal checker ensuring the integrity of the clock signal within specified timing constraints. If reset (rst_n_in) is not asserted, it checks two timing parameters: input high pulse width (tIH) and input pulse width (tIPW). If the current time is greater than tIH or the duration since the last cke_in positive edge is less than tIH, it registers a tIH violation. Similarly, if the time since the last cke_in event is less than tIPW, it triggers a tIPW violation. These violations are logged along with their timestamps. The current time is also updated at each cke_in event."
