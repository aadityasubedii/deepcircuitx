    "block_comment": "This block of code compares ranges of bits in a current address with the corresponding ranges in an end boundary address and updates flag bits according to the comparison results. On every positive edge of the input clock, it checks if the 24th to 29th, 16th to 23rd, and 8th to 15th bits of the current address are greater than or equal to those of the end boundary address. If they are, the corresponding flags (AC3_G_E3, AC2_G_E2, and AC1_G_E1) are set to high; otherwise, they are set to low."
