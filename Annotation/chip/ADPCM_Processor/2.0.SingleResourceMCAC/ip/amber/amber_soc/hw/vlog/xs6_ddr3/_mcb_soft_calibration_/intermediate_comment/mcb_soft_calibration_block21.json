    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the DDR termination and addressing modes in a memory controller subsystem. It operates by checking the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N status signal in UDQS_CLK_N_TERM_WAIT state. If the signal is not active, the system remains in the same state; if the signal is active, the system transfers to the UDQS_PIN_WRITE_P_TERM state. In this second state, the IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR is updated with the value of the PTerm, which sets the Postamble termination for address and command signals."
