This block of code represents an instantiation of a serializer/deserializer (SERDES) module in a digital communication system. The SERDES operates in master mode, accepts a 2-bit wide data input, and is configured to bypass clock signals. The module takes data signals 'dqpum' and 'dqnum' on D1 and D2 inputs respectively, and a write enable signal 'dqIO_w_en_0' on the T1 and T2 inputs. It outputs data on 'udm_oq' and 'udm_t'. The control signals are managed using 'ioclk90' for the clock signal, 'pll_ce_90' for clock enable, and 'int_sys_rst' for the reset signal. Other inputs and outputs are held constant at logic 0 or 1 where appropriate.
