Comment: 
This block outputs data from a FIFO memory structure. On the rising edge of the clock (clk), if a clear signal is present, the output (data_out) is the first element in the FIFO (fifo[0]). If the clear signal is not present, the output is indexed from the FIFO at the read_pointer's location.
