This block manages the assignments for different control and data signals of a Memory Interface Generator (MIG) based on the given condition. If the third port is enabled (C_PORT_ENABLE[2] is 1), the port 2 related data, command, and clock signals are assigned to correspondingly named mig signals. The read and write signals are also set accordingly along with the read and write data sets and masks. However, if the third port is not enabled, then all these signals are set to 0. The port 2 command empty and full signals are assigned corresponding MIG signals at the end.
