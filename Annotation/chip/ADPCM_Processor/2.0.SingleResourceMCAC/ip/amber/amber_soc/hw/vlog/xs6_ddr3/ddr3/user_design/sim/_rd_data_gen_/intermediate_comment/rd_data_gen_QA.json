It generates data based on a sequence of commands and parameters input to the module. The parameters and functionality of the module can be tailored based on requirements such as the address width, data width, burst length, and data pattern, among others. The data generated is ready for use by sequential modules and digital systems in read operations. The specific functionality triggered depends on valid command signals and readiness of connected modules. Some of the outputs include ready signals for command and data, burst sizes, last word, and the data itself. Likewise, it handles data on different modes and reset mechanisms. It instantiates either SP6_DGEN (specifically used for SPARTAN6 family) or V6_DGEN (specifically for VIRTEX6 family) depending on the FAMILY parameter."
