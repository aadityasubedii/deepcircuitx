Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is continually monitoring the 54th bit of the input data-queue (dq_in) for any changes. When a change in state of this bit occurs, a function named 'dq_timing_check' is invoked with parameter 53, this function is most likely used to perform a certain timing check or delay operation on the 54th bit of dq_in.
