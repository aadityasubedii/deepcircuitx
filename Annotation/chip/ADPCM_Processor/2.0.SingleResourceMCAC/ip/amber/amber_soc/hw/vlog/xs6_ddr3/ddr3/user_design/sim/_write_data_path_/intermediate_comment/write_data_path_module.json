    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe 'write_data_path' module manages write operations to memory in FPGA. It interfaces with the 'wr_data_gen' submodule for actual data generation. Inputs include clock, reset, command validation, seed for pseudorandom binary sequence generation, mode selection, fixed data, memory address, and block length. Outputs indicate command readiness, data validity, writing of last word, data to be written, byte mask, and end of write operation. Internal signals manage command readiness and data validity. The module excels due to easy integration and configurable parameters."
