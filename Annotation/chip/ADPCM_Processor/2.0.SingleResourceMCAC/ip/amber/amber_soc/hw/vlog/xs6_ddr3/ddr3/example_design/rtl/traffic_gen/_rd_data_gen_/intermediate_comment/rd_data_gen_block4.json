    "block_comment": "This block of code depicts the functioning of a data validity flag in a synchronous design under various conditions. Upon a rising edge of the clock (clk_i) and if the first bit of reset (rst_i[0]) is high, the data_valid signal gets cleared (delays designated by #TCQ are typically attributed to signal propagation or other hardware aspects). If the user_burst_cnt equals to 1 and the data_port_fifo_rdy is ready, the data_valid flag is set to 0. If the user_burst_cnt is greater than or equal to 1 or a cmd_start command is issued, the data_valid flag is set high, indicating the data is valid for processing."
