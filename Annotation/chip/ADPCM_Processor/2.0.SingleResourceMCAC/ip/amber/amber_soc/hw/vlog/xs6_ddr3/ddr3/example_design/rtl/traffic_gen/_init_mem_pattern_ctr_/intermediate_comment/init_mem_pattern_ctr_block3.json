    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a mode selection functionality using a clocked mechanism and reset condition. The implementation is done using a conditional block that depends on the value of 'FAMILY' and 'vio_modify_enable'. If the 'rst_i' signal is activated or 'FAMILY' value corresponds to \"VIRTEX6\", the 'bl_mode_sel' is set to 'FIXED_BL_MODE'. Otherwise, it's set to 'PRBS_BL_MODE'. If the 'vio_modify_enable' signal is asserted, the 'bl_mode_sel' is assigned with 'vio_bl_mode_value'. This block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock 'clk_i'."
