    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a register that writes new data with a positive edge of a clock signal. When the 'mcb_cmd_en_i' input signal is enabled, the current address 'mcb_cmd_addr_i' is stored in the register 'mcb_cmd_addr_r' at the time of the positive (rising) edge of the clock cycle. This mechanism acts as a latch, capturing and storing the address for later use when appropriate conditions are met."
