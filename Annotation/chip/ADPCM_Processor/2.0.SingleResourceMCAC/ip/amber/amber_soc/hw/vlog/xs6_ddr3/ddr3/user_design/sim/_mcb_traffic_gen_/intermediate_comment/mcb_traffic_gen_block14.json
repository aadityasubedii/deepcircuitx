    "block_comment": "This block is a module instantiation of 'mcb_flow_control', a flow control unit in Memory Controller Block (MCB). It controls the read and write operations, along with address generation and Burst Length (bl) decision. Signals ending with '_i' are inputs to this block, such as 'clk_i' (clock input), 'rst_i' (reset input), 'cmd_rdy_o' (command ready output signal), and 'cmd_valid_i' (command valid input signal) among others. On the other side, signals ending with '_o' are outputs, covering the MCB commands, MCB command enable, write/read addresses, write/read burst lengths, etc. The final signals monitor and regulate the control of the last word read or write, indicating the flow controller's condition for sending further data or accepting incoming data."
