    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for addressing and status updates in the system. It is implemented using assign statements and logical operators to control when these updates occur. The base_address_update occurs when there's no system halt and execute and i_base_address_wen flags are active. The status bits flags, mode, mode_rds_oh, irq_mask, firq_mask are updated either during normal operations or when ldm_status_bits flag is on (with the exception for mode_rds_oh that is updated whenever the system is not halted) along with their corresponding wen flags active."
