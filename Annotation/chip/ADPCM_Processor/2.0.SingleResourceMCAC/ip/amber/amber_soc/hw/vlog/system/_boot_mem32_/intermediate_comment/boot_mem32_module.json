    "module": "Module-level comment: The module 'boot_mem32' functions as a memory manager in SoC designs, interfacing with Wishbone bus for reading and writing data. It utilizes input signals like address, data, cycle, strobe, and write enable for operation initiation and control. Outputs include read data, acknowledgment, and error, with internal signals maintaining operation state and data processing. It contains debug functionality, with random jitter additions. Supports interaction with Xilinx FPGA hardware and generic SRAM. Primarily divided into signal definition, assignment, debug conditioning, and hardware-specific operations."
