    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for generating an asynchronous reset signal (`async_rst`). The asynchronous reset signal is generated by logically ORing the system reset signal (`sys_rst`) and the inverse of variable `powerup_pll_locked`. The signal `async_rst` becomes active (HIGH) when either the system has issued a reset or the phase-locked-loop (PLL) is not locked."
