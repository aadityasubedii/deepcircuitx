    "block_comment": "This block of code is mainly for latching the valid bytes based on specific conditions. When a positive edge of either the WB_CLK_I signal or a reset signal is detected, this block will start to execute. If a reset signal is received, the LatchValidBytes output will reset to 0. In case no reset signal is detected but TxLengthLt4 & TxBDReady condition is true, LatchValidBytes will be set to 1. In all the other scenarios, LatchValidBytes will remain 0."
