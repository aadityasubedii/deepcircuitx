Comment: 
This block of code assigns the current value of the register 'address_r' to the wire 'o_address'. This operation is achieved using the 'assign' keyword which implies continuous assignment in Verilog, continuously updating 'o_address' as 'address_r' changes. The contents of the register are sent to the output wire, thus allowing other hardware components access to the 'address_r' register value in real-time.
