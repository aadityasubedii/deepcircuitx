This block configures memory interface assignments if a specific condition is met. If block conditions confirming certain configuration and port enablement are satisfied, memory interface variables are assigned appropriate respective values like read data, clock, enable signal, overflow, error, full, empty signals, and count from the MIG. Should the conditions fail, these memory interface variables default to a low ('b0) signal.
