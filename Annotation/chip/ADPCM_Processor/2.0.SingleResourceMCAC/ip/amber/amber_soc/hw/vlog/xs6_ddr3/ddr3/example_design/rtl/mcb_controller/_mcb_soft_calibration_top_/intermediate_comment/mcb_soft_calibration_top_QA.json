The purpose of the calibration could be to ensure the proper timing or functionality of a memory system. Parameters are either hardcoded or passed to the module for memory type, calibration mode, simulation flag, and toggle options for various calibration stages. Clock, reset signals, and various other input/output connectivity are provided to the module. The calibration block instance is instantiated inside the main module. This module also contains IO buffer related code which is gated by generate blocks according to memory type and calibration modes. Lastly, it employs flip-flops to synchronize inputs to the UI clock domain."
