    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for assigning a default or reset value to the signal `p4_cmp_error`. The implementation of this block is straightforward. It uses the `assign` keyword in Verilog for continuous assignment to set the value of `p4_cmp_error` to `0` (represented by the binary literal `'b0`). This value remains the same until it's explicitly changed by some other part of the code."
