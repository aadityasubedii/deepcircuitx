    "block_comment": "This block of code checks whether the 8-bit value in the counter is equal to zero. It assigns the result of the comparison, which is a boolean value, to the variable CountEq0. This is achieved through the 'assign' keyword and '==' operator, where 'assign' is used for continuous assignment and '==' is the equality operator. When the value of Counter is zero, CountEq0 will be set to 1 (true), otherwise it will be set to 0 (false). This is a common way of condition checking in Verilog."
