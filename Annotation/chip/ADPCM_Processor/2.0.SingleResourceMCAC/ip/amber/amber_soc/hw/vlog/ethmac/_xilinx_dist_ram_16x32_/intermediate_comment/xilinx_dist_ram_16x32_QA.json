It utilizes primitive RAM16X1D (16-depth 1-bit width distributed RAM) to compose larger memory. The module has an interface for data input, write enable, read and write address, data output, and writing clock signal. Each RAM16X1D operates as an individual 1-bit wide memory cell in the module, collectively providing a 32-bit wide data interface. It handles both read and write operations."
