    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code describes a synchronous setup with a reset condition. It is primarily involved in toggling the TxAbortSync1 signal based on the state of the Reset and WB_CLK_I signals. If the Reset signal is high, the TxAbortSync1 signal is asynchronously reset to 0 after a propagation delay specified by Tp. In the absence of a reset (i.e., when Reset is low and there's a rising edge on WB_CLK_I), the signal TxAbortSync1 is set to the value of TxAbort after the same propagation delay."
