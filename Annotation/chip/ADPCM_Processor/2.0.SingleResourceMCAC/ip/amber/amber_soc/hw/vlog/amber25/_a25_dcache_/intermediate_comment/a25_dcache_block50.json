    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for managing the state of exclusive read hit in a cache model. If there's a signal to clear the read hit (`ex_read_hit_clear`), it resets the `ex_read_hit_r` and `ex_read_hit_way` registers. Otherwise, if there's a read hit (`ex_read_hit`), it sets `ex_read_hit_r` to 1, indicating a successful hit and sets `ex_read_hit_way` equal to the `data_hit_way` from current address. A debug message is also conditionally printed during a successful hit for diagnosing."
