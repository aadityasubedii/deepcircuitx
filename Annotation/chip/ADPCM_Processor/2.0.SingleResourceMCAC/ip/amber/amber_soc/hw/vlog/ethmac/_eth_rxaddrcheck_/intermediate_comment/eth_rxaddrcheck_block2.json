    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code extracts a byte from the 'IntHash' input signal based on the 2-bit signal from 'CrcHash'. The extraction takes place within a clocked process. Specifically, it defines the value of 'ByteHash' based on the two most significant bits of 'CrcHash'. If 'CrcHash[4:3]' is '00', the lowest byte (bits 7:0) of 'IntHash' is assigned to 'ByteHash'. For '01', 'ByteHash' gets the second byte (bits 15:8) and so on. For '11', the highest byte (bits 31:24) is assigned to 'ByteHash'."
