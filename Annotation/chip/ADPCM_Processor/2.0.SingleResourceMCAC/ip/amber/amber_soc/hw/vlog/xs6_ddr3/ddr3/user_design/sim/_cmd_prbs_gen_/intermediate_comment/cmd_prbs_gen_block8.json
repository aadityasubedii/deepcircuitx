    "block_comment": "The function calculates the logarithm base 2 of an input integer. It starts with an initial value of 1 for the logarithm and iteratively divides the input number by 2, using bitwise right shift, until the input number becomes zero. The number of iterations taken to reach zero is the requisite log base2 value of the input integer."
