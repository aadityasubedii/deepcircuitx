    "block_comment": "The given code block is making a series of connections to an external module using the dot notation. The external module is not shown, but it expects two input ports called 'i_pc_sel' and 'i_pc_wen'. These ports are assigned with signals 'pc_sel_r' and 'pc_wen_r' respectively which come from the parent module. Both signals are implied to be read signals as indicated by the '_r' postfix. It's standard to use '_r' at the end of signals associated with register or read outputs in a hardware design's RTL (Register Transfer Level) code."
