    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to stall write operations under certain conditions. The write operation is stalled if a write hit is detected and the control state is not in the WRITE_HIT1 state, or if a write miss is detected and the control state is not in the IDLE state, or if a stall is instructed by the write buffer (`i_wb_stall`)."
