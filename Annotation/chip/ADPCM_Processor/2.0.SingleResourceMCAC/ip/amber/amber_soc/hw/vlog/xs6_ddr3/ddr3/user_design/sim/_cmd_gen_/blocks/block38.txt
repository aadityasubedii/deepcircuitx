The block of code updates a buffer's available read data count in synchronization with a rising edge of the input clock. It computes the available read data by adding a constant (64) to the count of the received read data and subtracting the count of the read data requested, with a delay defined by 'TCQ.' This operation helps to effectively manage the data read buffering.
