    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code checks whether the port 3 is configured as a read-only port and whether an invalid command is issued. If the configuration of port 3 (specified by `C_PORT_CONFIG[87:64]`) is \"R32\" and a command is enabled (`p3_cmd_en` is 1), but the command instruction `p3_cmd_instr[2]` and `p3_cmd_instr[0]` are both zeros (indicating a write attempt), it displays an error message and terminates the simulation.\n\nNote: Please replace the phrase \"This block of Verilog RTL code\" with the actual specific function of the block in your codebase if applicable."
