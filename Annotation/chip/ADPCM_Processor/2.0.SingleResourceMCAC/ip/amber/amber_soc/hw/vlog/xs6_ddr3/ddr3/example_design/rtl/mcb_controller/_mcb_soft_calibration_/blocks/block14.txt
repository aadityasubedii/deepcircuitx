Comment: 
The block of code initiates the start of dynamic calibration in the system. Upon entering this state, the block resets the Pre_SYSRST signal and zeroes the counter_inc and counter_dec counters. The subsequent condition checks if both SKIP_DYNAMIC_DQS_CAL and SKIP_DYN_IN_TERMINATION are true before transitioning to the DONE state.
