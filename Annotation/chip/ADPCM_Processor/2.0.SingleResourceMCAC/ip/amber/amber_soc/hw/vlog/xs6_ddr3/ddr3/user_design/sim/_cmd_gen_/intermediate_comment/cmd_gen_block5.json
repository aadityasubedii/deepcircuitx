    "block_comment": "The Verilog RTL block is a clocked logic that manages the content of the `bl_out_reg` register. At every clock edge, the block checks the value of the seventh bit of the `rst_i` bus. If the bit is high, it assigns the fixed value `fixed_bl_i` to the `bl_out_reg` register after a delay defined by `TCQ`. If the bit is low and `bl_out_vld` is high, it assigns the `bl_out` value to the `bl_out_reg` register after the same delay. This logic allows the module to asynchronously load a fixed value or update the stored value under specific enable conditions."
