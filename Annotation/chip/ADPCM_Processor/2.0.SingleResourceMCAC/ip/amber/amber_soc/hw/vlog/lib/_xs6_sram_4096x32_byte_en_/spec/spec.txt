Module name: xs6_sram_4096x32_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 4096x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA block RAM resources. It utilizes 8 RAMB16BWER primitives to create a 32-bit wide memory with 4096 addresses. The module has five input ports: i_clk (clock input), i_write_data (32-bit data input for write operations), i_write_enable (enable signal for write operations), i_address (12-bit address input for read/write operations), and i_byte_enable (4-bit input to enable writing specific bytes). It has one output port: o_read_data (32-bit output providing the data read from the memory). Internal signals include wea_b0 and wea
