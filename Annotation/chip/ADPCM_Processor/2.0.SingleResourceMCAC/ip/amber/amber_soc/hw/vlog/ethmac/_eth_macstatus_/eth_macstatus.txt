Module-level comment: 
The eth_macstatus module is integral to an Ethernet MAC subsystem, providing status monitoring of Ethernet transactions. It controls flag signals, counters, and state variables for reliable data transmission. Inputs include various clock, state, and error signals; outputs highlight the transmission statuses and error conditions. The module uses internal signals to capture different conditions or direct actions. Major operations are divided into sections based on behavioral and sequential logic in sync with receiving (Rx) and transmitting (Tx) sides, managing everything from signaling errors to managing collisions and enforcing quality of received packets.
