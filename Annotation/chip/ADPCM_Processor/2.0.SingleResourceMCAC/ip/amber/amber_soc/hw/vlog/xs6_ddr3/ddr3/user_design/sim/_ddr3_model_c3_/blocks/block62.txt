This block of code is responsible for checking the timing on the positive edge of Data Quantization System (DQS) input signal. To achieve this, it uses an always block set to trigger on the positive edge of the indexed DQS input signal `dqs_in[3]`. This in turn calls the `dqs_pos_timing_check` subroutine passing 3 as the argument.
