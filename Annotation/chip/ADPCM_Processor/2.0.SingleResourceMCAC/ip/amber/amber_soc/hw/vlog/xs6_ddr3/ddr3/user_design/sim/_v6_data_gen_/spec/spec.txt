Module name: v6_data_gen. Module specification: This module is a data generator for memory testing, supporting multiple data patterns including PRBS, address-based, walking 1's and 0's, neighbor, and hammer patterns. It takes inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), PRBS seed (prbs_fseed_i), data mode (data_mode_i), address (addr_i, m_addr_i), and control signals. The module outputs generated data (data_o) based on the selected mode and input parameters. Internal signals include pattern-specific data registers (prbs_data, adata, hdata, ndata, w1data), counters (acounts, walk_cnt), and control flags (burst_count_reached2, data_valid). The module is organized into sections for different data patterns, including PRBS generation, address-based patterns,
