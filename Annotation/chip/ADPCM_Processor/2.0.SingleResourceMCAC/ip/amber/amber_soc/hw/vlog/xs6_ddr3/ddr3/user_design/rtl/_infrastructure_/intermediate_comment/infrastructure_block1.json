    "block_comment": "This block assigns the final signal 'rst0' from a synchronous reset signal array, 'rst0_sync_r'. The assignment uses the element at the maximum index (RST_SYNC_NUM - 1) of the array, ensuring the operation is based on the last element in the 'rst0_sync_r' array. This sequential sync reset methodology provides a way to resolve potential metastability issues when crossing clock domains."
