Comment: 
The block of code is a method invocation that triggers `dqs_pos_timing_check` function at the positive edge of `dqs_in[8]`. The `always @` keyword in Verilog specifies that the function should be called or "triggered" whenever there's a change from low to high signal (positive edge) in the `dqs_in[8]` signal. This implementation is mainly used for synchronizing the timing checks according to the rising edge of the DDR signal.
