    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for handling data validation and error detection in data quality (DQ) lanes. Whenever there is a positive edge of the clock trigger, or when the reset input is active or a manual clear error flag is set, the DQ lane errors and data_is_valid flag are reset. If not in a reset state, the signal of data validity is updated with the input signal and the DQ lane error signals along with the cumulative DQ lane error register are also updated. The block implementation follows a synchronous design strategy, with the actions taken on the positive edge of the clock signal and the usage of the TCQ delay model."
