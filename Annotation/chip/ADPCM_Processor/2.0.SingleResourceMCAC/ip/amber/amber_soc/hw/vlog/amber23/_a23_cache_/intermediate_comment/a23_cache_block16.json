    "block_comment": "This block of code is a function that selects one way or path based on a set of validation bits and a randomized number. If initial validation bits do not correspond to any valid paths (represented as 0), the function assigns the path based on the value of the bit in the 'valid_bits' input. However, if all validation bits are true, meaning all paths are valid, the function will pick a way based on the upper 3 bits of the 'random_num' number. This approach adds an element of randomness to the path selection when all paths are valid, helping to avoid constant usage of the same path."
