    "block_comment": "The block of code is designed to generate an output buffer for the interface with a DRAM memory depending upon the number of data query pins. This is only done if the number of data query pins, `C_NUM_DQ_PINS`, is equal to 16. The implementation consists of an instance of the `OBUFT` module named `iob_udm`, which has three connections: the input to the buffer (`ioi_udm`), the output enable signal (`t_udm`), and the output signal (`mcbx_dram_udm`)."
