Comment: 
This block of code is used to assign a 3-bit value extracted from a larger instruction or command to the `bram_instr_i` input of a Block RAM (BRAM). This is achieved by selecting the bits `[32:30]` from the `bram_cmd_i` input signal, effectively extracting a subfield from the original signal for subsequent use in the BRAM. It signifies the importance of these specific bits in the context of the BRAM operation.
