    "module": "Module-level comment: The cmd_prbs_gen is a PRBS generator functioning as a test pattern generator in FPGA's. It uses input control signals with seed inputs to generate PRBS of the set width (64, 32, or 20 bit). The implementation is done using a linear feedback shift register (lfsr_q) running on the clock input (clk_i). Conditions for updating PRBS are controlled by clk_en and prbs_seed_init. The pseudo-random sequences are then output through prbs_o. The code is modular, allowing emulation of different test scenarios based on PRBS_CMD for various FPGA families."
