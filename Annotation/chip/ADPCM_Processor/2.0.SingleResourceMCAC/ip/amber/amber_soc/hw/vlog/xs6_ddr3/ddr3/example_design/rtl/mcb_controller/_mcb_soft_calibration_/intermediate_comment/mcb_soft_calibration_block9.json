    "block_comment": "This block of code is involved in the configuration and control of an I/O DRAM Read Processing unit. It initiates a read command by setting the `IODRPCTRLR_CMD_VALID` signal high and assigning the maximum memory cell address to `IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR`. The `IODRPCTRLR_R_WB` flag is set to READ_MODE, indicating a read operation. The `Max_Value_Previous` is updated with the current `Max_Value`. Subsequent state transition is managed by the `IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N` signal. If this signal marks readiness (high), the state machine transitions to the `READ_MAX_VALUE` state; otherwise, it waits in the `WAIT10` state."
