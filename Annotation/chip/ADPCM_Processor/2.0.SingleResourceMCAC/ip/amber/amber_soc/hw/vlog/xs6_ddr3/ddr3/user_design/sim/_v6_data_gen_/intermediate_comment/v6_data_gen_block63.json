    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block controls the assignment of hexadecimal values to eight shift registers (SHIFT_0 through SHIFT_7) and a blanking variable (BLANK) based on the state of a data mode input (`data_mode_i`) and a reset input (`rst_i`). When `data_mode_i` equals `3'b101` or `3'b100` or when a reset is asserted, all shift registers are assigned a series of increasing power-of-two hexadecimal values starting from `8'h01` and the blanking variable is set to zero. In other conditions, negative logic is applied where every shift register is assigned a hexadecimal compliment of corresponding power-of-two value and the blanking variable set to `8'hff`."
