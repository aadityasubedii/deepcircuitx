    "block_comment": "This line specifies a combinatorial block that is sensitive to the rising edge of the dqs_in[10] signal. Whenever the value of the signal dqs_in[10] changes from '0' to '1', a posedge event occurs and the function dqs_pos_timing_check with an argument of 10 will be called. The function dqs_pos_timing_check could possibly be defining the timing check of a data qualification system's positive edge, within the larger RTL design."
