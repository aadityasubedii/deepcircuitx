Comment: 
This line of code is responsible for executing a bit shift operation on a shift register. Specifically, it assigns the 8th bit value of 'ShiftReg', a presumed 8-bit shift register, to 'ShiftedBit'. It's a direct assign operation that does not involve any complex computations or conditions.
