Comment: 
This block of code implements a synchronous reset mechanism for two separate input sets, ZIO and RZQ. The reset operation is carried out at the positive edge of the UI_CLK signal or if the RST signal is high. If either of these conditions is true, the inputs for ZIO (ZIO_IN_R1 and ZIO_IN_R2) and RZQ (RZQ_IN_R1 and RZQ_IN_R2) are reset to '0'. This mechanism ensures that if any faults occur in the system or during initialization, the ZIO and RZQ inputs return to a known baseline state.
