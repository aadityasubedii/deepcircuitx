Comment: 
This Verilog block performs data generation or selection based on input signals. When the `cmd_startC` signal is HIGH, it uses the `sel_w1gen_logic` signal to control the generation of `w1data`, segmenting on the `addr_i[4:3]` signal, and data_mode condition to select between `Data_Gen()` and `Data_GenW0()` functions. When `cmd_startC` signal is not HIGH and `MEM_BURST_LEN` equals 8, data bits are reshuffled on each of `NUM_DQ_PINS` segment of `w1data`. The block is conditioned to be executed on the rising edge of the input clock signal `clk_i` and it uses non-blocking assignments to avoid race conditions. The `#TCQ` identifiers indicate timing control statements.
