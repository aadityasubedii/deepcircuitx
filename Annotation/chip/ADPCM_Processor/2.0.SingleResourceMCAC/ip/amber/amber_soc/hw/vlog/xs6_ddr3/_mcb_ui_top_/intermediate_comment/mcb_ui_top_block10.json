    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is for instantiating the AXI MCB (Memory Control Block) module for the Spartan6 family of FPGAs. The AXI MCB functions as an AXI interface for the MCB, facilitating read and write operations supported by the AXI bus protocol. It is parameterized with the AXI ID, address, and data widths, read and write operation support, registered input enable configuration, burst support, MCB address and data widths, strict coherency support, and advanced peripheral bus (APB) enable. The AXI signals required for performing read and write transfers are included as inputs or outputs to the module. Apart from these, it also interfaces with the MCB via command, write, and read signals to facilitate memory operations. The design also contains a synchronous calibration complete signal indicating MCB's calibration sequence's completion."
