Module name: example_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level design for a DDR3 memory controller interface. It instantiates a memory controller wrapper (memc3_wrapper_inst) and a testbench top module (memc3_tb_top_inst) to simulate and test DDR3 memory operations. The module has input ports for system clock (c3_sys_clk) and reset (c3_sys_rst_i), output ports for various DDR3 SDRAM interface signals (mcb3_dram_*), and inout ports for bidirectional data and strobe signals. Internal signals include clock management signals (c3_clk0, c3_sysclk_2x), reset signals (c3_rst0, c3_async_rst), and numerous control and data signals for multiple read and write ports (c3_p0_
