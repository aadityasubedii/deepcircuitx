Module name: system. Module specification: The system module is a top-level design for an embedded processor with various peripherals and interfaces. It integrates a processor core (A25 or A23), memory interfaces (boot and main memory), UART interfaces, Ethernet MAC, interrupt controller, timer module, test module, and DDR3 memory interface for Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. The module has input ports for reset, clocks, UART, and Ethernet signals, and output ports for UART, Ethernet, DDR3 control, and LEDs. Internal signals include system clocks, reset, and various Wishbone bus signals for interconnecting components. The module is organized into several blocks: clock generation, processor core, Ethernet interface, memory interfaces, UART controllers, test module, timer module, interrupt controller, and a Wishbone bus arbiter. It uses a Wishbone bus architecture
