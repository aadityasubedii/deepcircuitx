Comment: 
This Verilog block of code is designed to perform a timing check triggered on the positive edge of the 31st bit of the `dqs_in` signal array. The `always @` construct acts as an event detection mechanism that gets triggered whenever the specified event, in this case, the positive-going transition of `dqs_in[30]` occurs. Once this trigger event is observed, the `dqs_neg_timing_check(30)` function is called to execute the desired timing check operation at the 31st bit position.
