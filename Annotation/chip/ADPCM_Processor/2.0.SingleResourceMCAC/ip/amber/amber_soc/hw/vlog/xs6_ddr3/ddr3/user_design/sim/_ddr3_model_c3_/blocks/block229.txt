The block of code serves as a function to calculate nominal Round-Trip Time (RTT) based on an input value. The function takes a 3-bit input and performs a switch-case logic operation to select a specific division of 'RZQ', a resistance value, as the output. The output differs based on the case that matches the input, giving different RTT nominal values. If no case matches, it defaults to zero, indicating an invalid or non-existing value.
