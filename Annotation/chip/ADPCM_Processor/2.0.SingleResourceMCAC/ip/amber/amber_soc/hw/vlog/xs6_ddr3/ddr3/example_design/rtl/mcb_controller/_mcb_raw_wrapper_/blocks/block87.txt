This block of Verilog RTL code is a self-refresh process controller for a system. Its function is to reset self-refresh entries to inactive LOW (0) when the system reset (`sys_rst`) is high at the rising edge of the UI clock (`ui_clk`). The code uses an always block to check each posedge of `ui_clk` signal; if the system reset (`sys_rst`) is high, it sets all the three 'self-refresh' registers to '0'. Otherwise, it shifts the value of 'self-refresh" entry from 'R1' to 'R2' and from 'R2' to 'R3'. By doing so, it implements a 3-stage pipeline for the self-refresh control signal.
