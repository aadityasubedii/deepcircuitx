    "block_comment": "The block of code is designed primarily to handle data width in a wishbone protocol. Depending on the data width (WB_DWIDTH), it segments or aggregates data appropriately. If WB_DWIDTH is 128, it indicates that the data is split into four 32-bit segments, and based on the address bits i_wb_adr[3:2], a specific segment of the input data (i_wb_dat) is selected as wb_wdata32. The wb_rdata32 is then assigned to the output data (o_wb_dat), repeating 4 times. If the data width is other than 128 bits, input data (i_wb_dat) is directly assigned to wb_wdata32 and wb_rdata32 is assigned to the output data directly."
