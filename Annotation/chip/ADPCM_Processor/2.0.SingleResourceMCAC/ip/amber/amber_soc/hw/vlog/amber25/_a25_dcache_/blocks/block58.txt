This block handles data write operations in a memory module, updating a register when a write condition is met. Upon each positive edge of the input clock signal (i_clk), it checks for either a write_hit or consecutive_write condition. If either condition is true, the block transfers the value from the data_wdata signal into the data_wdata_r register.
