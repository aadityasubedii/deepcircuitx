    "block_comment": "The block controls the start of reading from a Buffer Descriptor (BD) in a transmit operation. It triggers the BD read operation whenever there is a retry packet that hasn't been cleared from the previous transmission or a new status write request, but only if there is neither a current BD read operation ongoing (`BlockingTxBDRead` is low) nor the current BD is ready to be transmitted (`TxBDReady` is low)."
