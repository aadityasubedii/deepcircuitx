    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'eth_test' module emulates Ethernet transactions for testing an AMBER Processor. It enables packet creation, handling, transmission, and reception, and manages the MDIO interface. Inputs include data and control signals, while outputs carry the data to be transmitted. Internal signals and state machines coordinate the stages of execution. Memory arrays store packet data, and file handling operations are incorporated for packet loading and logging. Various blocks execute initialization, state management, CRC computation, MDIO transfers, and more."
