Comment: 
This block of Verilog code triggers a 'dq_timing_check' function whenever there is a change on the 61st entry of the 'dq_in' signal array. The implementation is carried out using an 'always' block, which behaves similar to an infinite loop in traditional software programming. Its operation is triggered solely based on changes to the chosen monitored variable, in this case, 'dq_in[60]'. The chosen function 'dq_timing_check(60)' is then invoked which might be implemented elsewhere to handle data timing check for the 61st entry in the 'dq_in' signal array.
