    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional generate statement in Verilog that works as an interface switch between UI Memory Controller Block (UI MCB) and an AXI interface based on the value of `C_S1_AXI_ENABLE`. If `C_S1_AXI_ENABLE` is 0, MCB interfaces are directly mapped to input signals. Otherwise, the AXI interface is enabled, addressing is masked and synchronized, and the `axi_mcb` and `axi_mcb_synch` modules are instantiated using designated parameters. This AXI interface provides access to the MCB storage block, managing communication protocols, data transactions, and error handling. The module `axi_mcb_synch` is used for synchronization purposes under AXI configuration."
