    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for clock-edge driven data transfer from one part of the system to another, specifically for the 10th bit from an address. The transfer happens whenever there's a positive edge on the input clock (i_clk). The always @ construct ensures that whenever there is a positive edge on the 'i_clk', the 10th bit of the 'i_address' gets stored in the 'address_9_r' variable."
