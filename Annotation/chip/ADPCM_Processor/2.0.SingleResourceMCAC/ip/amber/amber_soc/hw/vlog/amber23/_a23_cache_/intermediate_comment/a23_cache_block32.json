    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the cache_busy_stall signal based on the state of the cache and whether it's enabled. It leverages conditions that check the current state of the cache and if it's enabled. If the cache state is either CS_TURN_AROUND or CS_FILL1 and it's enabled, or if the cache state is CS_INIT irrespective of the 'enable' status, the cache_busy_stall signal is asserted."
