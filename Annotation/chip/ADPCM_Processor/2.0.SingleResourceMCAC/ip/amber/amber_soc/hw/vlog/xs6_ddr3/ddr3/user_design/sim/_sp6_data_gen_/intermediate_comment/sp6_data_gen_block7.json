    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous logic block that updates the `hdata` variable based on certain conditions. At the rising edge of the system clock (clk_i), if the reset (rst_i) is active, the `hdata` is reset to zero. If reset is not active and either `fifo_rdy_i` is TRUE with `user_burst_cnt` non-zero or `cmd_startC` is triggered, `hdata` is assigned a different specific hexadecimal value depending upon the value of `NUM_DQ_PINS`. This implies that the conditions help pick a specific pattern of data to be stored in `hdata` varying on the size of `NUM_DQ_PINS`."
