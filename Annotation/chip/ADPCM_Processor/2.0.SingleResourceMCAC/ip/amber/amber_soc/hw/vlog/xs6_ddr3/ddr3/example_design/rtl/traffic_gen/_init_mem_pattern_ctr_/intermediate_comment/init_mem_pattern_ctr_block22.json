    "block_comment": "The block is a clock-triggered logic that determines the value of the 'INC_COUNTS' based on the width of the data bus 'DWIDTH'. At each positive edge of the clock input 'clk_i', it checks the value of 'DWIDTH' and assigns a decimal constant to 'INC_COUNTS' according to the condition met: 'DWIDTH' being between 256 and 576 results in an 'INC_COUNTS' of 32, between 128 and 224 yields 16, equal to 64 or 96 gives 8, and equal to 32 sets 'INC_COUNTS' to 4."
