    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM memory device. It simulates memory operations, timing characteristics, and protocol adherence. The module processes input commands, manages internal states, performs read/write operations, and enforces timing constraints. It uses a combination of always blocks, tasks, and functions to handle clock edges, command decoding, data input/output, and timing checks. The module also includes features like initialization sequence, power-down modes, and on-die termination."
