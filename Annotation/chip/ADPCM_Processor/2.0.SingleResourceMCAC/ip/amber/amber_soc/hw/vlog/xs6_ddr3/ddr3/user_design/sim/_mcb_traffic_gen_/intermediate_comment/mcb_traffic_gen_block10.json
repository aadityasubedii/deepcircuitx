    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code controls the enable signal for command read operations in the memory controller block (MCB). In the code line, `assign cmd_rd_en = ~mcb_cmd_full_i & mcb_cmd_en_o;`, the enable signal `cmd_rd_en` is determined by the binary AND operation between the negation of the `mcb_cmd_full_i` signal and `mcb_cmd_en_o`. The `mcb_cmd_full_i` indicates if the command queue in the MCB is full or not; it's complemented to ensure read operations are only enabled if the command queue is not full. The `mcb_cmd_en_o` indicates if it's permitted to issue a new command to MCB externally. Consequently, `cmd_rd_en` will be high only if there is room in the command queue and if the external command issue is enabled."
