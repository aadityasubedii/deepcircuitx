This logic block is used for the assignment of the 10th bit of the 'Random' array. The implementation incorporates a conditional statement, determining whether the integer variable 'RetryCnt' is greater than nine. If this condition is true, the implementation assigns the 10th bit of the 'Random' array to the corresponding bit (10th bit) of the 'x[]' array. Otherwise, if this condition is false, it assigns the 10th bit to a binary zero, '1'b0'.
