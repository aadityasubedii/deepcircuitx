    "block_comment": "This block of code executes a function called 'dq_timing_check' whenever there is a change in the 48th bit of the 'dq_in' signal array. The function is specifically checking the timing aspects related to the 48th bit of 'dq_in' signal. The implementation leverages the 'always @' construct of Verilog, making this a sensitivity list based always block, meaning whenever the 48th bit of 'dq_in' (indexed as 47 due to 0-based indexing) has a change of state, the function 'dq_timing_check' with parameter '47' is triggered."
