    "block_comment": "The block constructs the command byte address for a 4 bit wide memory interface module based on the port, column, bank and row address scheme. Higher order bits are used for the row address, followed by bank and lower order bits pertain to column address. Depending on conditions such as width, order of memory addresses and configuration, address lines for various command, bank and column are identified. Further, addresses are assigned zero padding if they do not meet required width, ensuring a stable signal in memory interfaces by avoiding glitches due to undefined bits. This block is very important in scalable and modular memory systems as it correctly wires various areas in accordance to their address locations in memory."
