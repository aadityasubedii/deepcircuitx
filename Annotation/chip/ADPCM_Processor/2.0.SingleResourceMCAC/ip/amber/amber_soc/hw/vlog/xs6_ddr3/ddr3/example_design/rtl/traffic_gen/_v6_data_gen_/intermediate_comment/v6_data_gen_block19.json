    "block_comment": "This block of code handles memory write operations for a case when the burst length is 8 in a memory system. By checking the MEM_BURST_LEN condition, it controls the data allocation across the memory pins, specifically organizing data chunks according to the NUM_DQ_PINS defined. Each calculation slices the w1data vector into 4 sections according to the number of data pins and re-arranges the order of elements in each section. The use of the delay operator #TCQ ensures a proper timing sequence for these operations."
