    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code performs conditional signal assignments to the 'p4_mcb' commands depending on the active ports and their modes. If port 4 is enabled, it inspects the mode for port 4. In read mode, it assigns command attributes from the first enabled port (port 0, 1, 2, 3 or 5) in writing mode or retaining its initial values if none is enabled or in writing mode. In write mode, the command is directly mapped from port 4. Implementing this are conditional blocks, 'if-else' loops and 'assign' statements for signal assignments."
