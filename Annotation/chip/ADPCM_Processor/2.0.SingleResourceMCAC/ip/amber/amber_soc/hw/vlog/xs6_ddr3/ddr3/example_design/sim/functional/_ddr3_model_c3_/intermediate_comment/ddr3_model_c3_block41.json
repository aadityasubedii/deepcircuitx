    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code initiates a negative edge-triggered timing check on the dqs_in[24] signal. The `always` command is used to ensure that whenever the DQS input signal undergoes a negative edge transition, the dqs_pos_timing_check operation, specifically focused on the 24th indexed value of the DQS input signal, is invoked. This feature aids in verifying the correct timing or synchronization of signals in memory interfaces, particularly for the Date Strobe (DQS) signals."
