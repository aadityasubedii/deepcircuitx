    "block_comment": "This block of code signals the activation of the DQS receiver at the positive edge transition of the 6th DQS line (indexing from 0). The implementation does this by using an always block in Verilog that triggers on the positive edge of the `dqs_even[ 5]` signal. When such an event occurs, the function `dqs_even_receiver( 5)` is called."
