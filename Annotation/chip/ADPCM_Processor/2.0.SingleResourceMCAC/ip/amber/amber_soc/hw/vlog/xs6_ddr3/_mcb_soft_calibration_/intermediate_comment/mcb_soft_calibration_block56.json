    "block_comment": "This block manages a timer (WaitTimer) and a control signal (WarmEnough) based on different events in a self-refreshing system. Upon reset (RST), it initializes the WaitTimer to zero, and sets the control signal WarmEnough to high. When the system leaves the self-refresh state, it resets the timer and sets the control signal to low, indicating the system isn't warm enough. If the WaitTimer hits a value of 4, it retains the timer value and sets WarmEnough high, indicating the system is now warm enough. When WaitCountEnable is high, it increments the WaitTimer. In all other cases, it leaves the timer value unchanged."
