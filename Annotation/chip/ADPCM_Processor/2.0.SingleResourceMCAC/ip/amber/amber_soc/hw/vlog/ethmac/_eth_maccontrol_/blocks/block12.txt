Comment: 
This block manages a signal line, MuxedAbort, based on some conditions. On every positive clock edge of MTxClk or a positive edge of TxReset, the block evaluates the conditions and sets an abort signal. If a reset signal, TxReset, is detected, it sets MuxedAbort to 0 after time propagation delay (Tp). Similarly, if a start frame signal is detected through TxStartFrmIn, it forces MuxedAbort to 0 after delay Tp. Finally, if an abort signal from TxAbortIn is detected and it wasn't previously latched (shown by ~TxAbortInLatched) and data was used (TxUsedDataOutDetected), it sets the MuxedAbort to 1 after propagation delay (Tp), signifying an abort condition.
