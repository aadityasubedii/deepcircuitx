The block selects the next interrupt request signal in a prioritized manner. By using conditional assignment, this Verilog code snippet achieves its function. When the 'dabt_request' signal is active, it assigns '3’d1' to the 'next_interrupt'. If not, it checks for 'firq_request' and assigns '3’d2'. This process continues for 'irq_request', 'instruction_adex', 'instruction_iabt', 'und_request', and 'swi_request', each given a different 3-bit value. If none of the named interrupts are requested, it defaults to '3’d0'.
