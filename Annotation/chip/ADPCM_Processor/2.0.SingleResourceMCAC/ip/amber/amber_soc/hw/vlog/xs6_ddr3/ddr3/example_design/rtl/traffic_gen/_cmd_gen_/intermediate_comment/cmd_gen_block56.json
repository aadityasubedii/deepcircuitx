    "block_comment": "This code block is used to generate a specific type of block RAM (BRAM) when the variable `CMD_PATTERN` matches the string \"CGEN_BRAM\". It is based on the generate-if Verilog construct, used to create a conditional generation of design hierarchy, so the block represented by \"cv1\" will only be generated when the condition is met (i.e., `CMD_PATTERN` equals \"CGEN_BRAM\")."
