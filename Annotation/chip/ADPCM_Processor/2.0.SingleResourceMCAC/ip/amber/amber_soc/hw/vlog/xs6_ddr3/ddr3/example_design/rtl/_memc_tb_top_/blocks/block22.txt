This block of Verilog RTL code dynamically enables and reads data from various ports. It selects one of the data ports based on the value of C_PORT_ENABLE array. When C_PORT_ENABLE at a certain index is high, the code assigns the respective data and its valid signal from the selected port to cmp_data and cmp_data_valid. If the C_PORT_ENABLE for a specific port is not enabled, these signals will not be assigned. This way, the block ensures configurable port selection and data assignment.
