    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is centered around the management of a Memory Controller Block (MCB) with its read/write operations either directed by user logic or AXI. If the \"C_S4_AXI_ENABLE\" flag is set to 0, it uses user-defined signals to read and write data (P4_UI_MCB). The internal variables are assigned to their respective user-input values in this case. However, if the \"C_S4_AXI_ENABLE\" flag is not 0, it uses the AXI protocol to handle the read and write operations (P4_UI_AXI). Here, the addresses are masked and then fed to the MCB for AXI read/write operations. Moreover, it implements calibration synchronization for the MCB via \"mcb_ui_top_synch\". The AXI-based MCB component is instantiated with the properties of the MCB and AXI defined. The assignment and processing of signals for read/write operations are done based on AXI standards."
