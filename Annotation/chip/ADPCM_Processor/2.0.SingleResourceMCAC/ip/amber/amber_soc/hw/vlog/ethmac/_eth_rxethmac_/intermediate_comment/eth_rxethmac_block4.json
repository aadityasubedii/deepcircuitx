    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to reset or update two signals: 'RxStartFrm_d' and 'RxStartFrm', in response to either a rising clock edge or a reset signal. In terms of implementation, the block uses a synchronous always block that operates at the rising edge of 'MRxClk' clock signal or upon receiving a positive 'Reset' signal. If there is a reset, both 'RxStartFrm_d' and 'RxStartFrm' are cleared to zero, as indicated by '1'b0'. However, if the event is a rising clock edge, 'RxStartFrm_d' is updated with the value of 'GenerateRxStartFrm', and 'RxStartFrm' takes the delayed value of 'RxStartFrm_d'."
