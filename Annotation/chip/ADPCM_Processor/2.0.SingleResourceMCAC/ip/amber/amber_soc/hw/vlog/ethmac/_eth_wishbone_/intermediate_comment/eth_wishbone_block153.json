    "block_comment": "This block of code controls Read/Write operations of a section of RAM. The line `assign ram_ce = 1'b1;` enables the chip in every cycle. Write enable signal `ram_we` is asserted when a boundary descriptor (BD) write operation is active (indicated by `BDWrite` signal) and when write back enable signals `WbEn` and `WbEn_q` are both high. Alternatively, it's also set when either `TxStatusWrite` or `RxStatusWrite` signals are high. The output enable signal `ram_oe` is asserted under three different conditions. First, when `BDRead` and write back enable signals (`WbEn` and `WbEn_q`) coincide. Second, when transmit enable signals (`TxEn` and `TxEn_q`) coincide with either `TxBDRead` or `TxPointerRead`. Lastly, it's set when receive enable signals (`RxEn` and `RxEn_q`) are active and either `RxBDRead` or `RxPointerRead` are high."
