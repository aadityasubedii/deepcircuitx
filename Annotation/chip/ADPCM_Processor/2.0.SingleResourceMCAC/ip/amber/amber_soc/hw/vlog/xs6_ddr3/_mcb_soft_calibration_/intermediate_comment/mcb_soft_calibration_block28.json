    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the data written into the IODRPCTRLR and sets address in MCB_UIADDR with IOI_LDQS_CLK. It checks the status of MCB_RDY_BUSY_N and accordingly shifts states between LDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM and LDQS_CLK_N_TERM_WAIT. The MCB_CMD_VALID is set to 1. Different stages of this functionality are managed through the use of a state machine, where states are transitioned based on the condition of MCB_RDY_BUSY_N. It waits in the LDQS_CLK_N_TERM_WAIT state till MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is not active."
