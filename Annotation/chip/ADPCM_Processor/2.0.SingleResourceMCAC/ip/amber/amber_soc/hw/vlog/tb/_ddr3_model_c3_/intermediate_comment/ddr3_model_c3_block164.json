    "block_comment": "This block serves as a hardware check for the input address signal. Specifically, it triggers the function `cmd_addr_timing_check(7)` whenever there is a change in the least significant bit (`[0]`) of the `addr_in` input signal in an always block. This guarantees that the system consistently verifies the timing of the command address in synchronization with changes to the base address signal."
