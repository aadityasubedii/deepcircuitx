    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for assigning the value of \"cke_train_reg\" to \"cke_train\". This is implemented through the use of a continuous assignment statement \"assign\" which checks for any changes in the value of \"cke_train_reg\" and promptly assigns any new value to \"cke_train\". Consequently, this block can be understood as replicating the state of \"cke_train_reg\" in \"cke_train\"."
