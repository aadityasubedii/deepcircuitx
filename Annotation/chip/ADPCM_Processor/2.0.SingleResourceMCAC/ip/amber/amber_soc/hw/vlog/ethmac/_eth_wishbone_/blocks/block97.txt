This block of code handles the reset mechanism for a transmit logic system of a hardware design coded in Verilog. When a positive edge clock signal `MTxClk` or a reset signal `Reset` synchronously arrives, different actions are performed according to different conditions. If the reset signal is recieved, it sets the values of `TxAbort_q`, `TxRetry_q`, and `TxUsedData_q` to 0, effectively resetting them. Otherwise, in the event of a clock signal, the logic of the block assigns the current states of `TxAbort`, `TxRetry`, `TxUsedData` to `TxAbort_q`, `TxRetry_q`, `TxUsedData_q` respectively. Synchronous with the clock signal ensures the timing conformity.
