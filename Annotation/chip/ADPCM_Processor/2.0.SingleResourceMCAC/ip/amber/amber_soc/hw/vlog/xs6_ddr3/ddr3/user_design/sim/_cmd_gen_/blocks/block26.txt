Comment: 
This block of code controls the value of the register 'end_addr_r'. The value is updated on the rising edge of the input clock signal 'clk_i'. The new value is calculated as 'end_addr_i' (input) reduced by the product of 'DWIDTH/8' and 'fixed_bl_i' (also inputs), then incremented by 1. The update operation is executed after a delay specified by the '#TCQ' time constrictor queue.
