Comment: 
This block is responsible for handling Read/Write overrun situations for a receiver(Rx) buffer. An always block is used that operates on the positive edge of the Write Back(WB) clock or a Reset operation. When a reset is issued, RxOverrun is asynchronously set to 0. Within a normal clock cycle, if a write operation to the Rx status is detected, RxOverrun is cleared. In the absence of these conditions, if the Rx buffer is full during a Write operation, an overrun is set by asserting RxOverrun. This showcases checks and mitigations against data overruns in the cycle-based system.
