    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to generate Pseudo-Random Binary Sequences (PRBS). The implementation revolves around the 'cmd_prbs_gen' module that's instantiated twice, once for 'instr_prbs_gen_a' and once for 'instr_prbs_gen_b'. It takes in variables like clock signal, clock enable, seed initialization and seed value as inputs, generating the PRBS as output. `instr_prbs_gen_a` takes 15 least significant bits of `cmd_seed_i` while `instr_prbs_gen_b` takes bits from position 2 to 16 of the same seed for a different PRBS stream. The modules are active when the command pattern matches \"CGEN_PRBS\" or \"CGEN_ALL\"."
