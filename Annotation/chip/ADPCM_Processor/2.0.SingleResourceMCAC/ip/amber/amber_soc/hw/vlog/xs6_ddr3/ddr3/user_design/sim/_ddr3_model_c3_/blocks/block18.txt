This block of code implements a timing check logic in verilog. It uses the 'always' keyword which defines a block of code that will be executed constantly. The operation is based on a negative edge trigger of a signal contained in the 15th index (index 14) of the 'dqs_in' array. On the negative edge of this signal, the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' is called with 14 as the input argument.
