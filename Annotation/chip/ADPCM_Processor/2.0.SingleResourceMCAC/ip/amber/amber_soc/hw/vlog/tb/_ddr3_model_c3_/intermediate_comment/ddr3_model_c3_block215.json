    "block_comment": "This block of code defines specific parameters in a Verilog RTL design, setting the integer values for each. It defines `SAME_BANK` as `2'd0`, `DIFF_BANK` as `2'd1`, and `DIFF_GROUP` as `2'd2`. These defined constants help in differentiating between the operation types in the subsequent logic based on the banking and grouping differences in a memory subsystem, leading to a more readable and maintainable code."
