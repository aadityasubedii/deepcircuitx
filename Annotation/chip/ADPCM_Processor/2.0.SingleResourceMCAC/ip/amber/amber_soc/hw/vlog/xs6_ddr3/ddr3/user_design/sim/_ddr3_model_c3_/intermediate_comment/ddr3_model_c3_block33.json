    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a task for checking the timing of the negative data strobe (dqs_neg) in a DDR system. The process is triggered based on various conditions such as 'write_levelization', 'dqs_in_valid', and the 'dll_locked' status. Timing violations in the respective conditions are detected using multiple IF-ELSE constructs comparing current time ('$time') with various intervals defined by system parameters (TWLDQSEN, TDQSH, TDQSH, TDS), designed to uphold the integrity of the system's operation. Changes in the state of variables 'check_dq_tdipw', 'check_dm_tdipw', 'prev_dqs_in', 'tm_dqs' and 'tm_dqs_neg' are handled, modelling the dynamics of the dqs strobe. Errors are indicated by displaying custom error messages, providing insights about the transgression. Checks for 'tWLDQSEN', 'tDQSH', 'tDSH', 'tDS' violations are a part of the implementation, denoting the compliance with DDR timing rules."
