Module-level comment: The a25_coprocessor module is a co-processor for the ARM25 microprocessor, managing cache control and fault handling. It uses input signals to control/cache operations, handle faults, and perform required coprocessor operations. Cache control is achieved through internal signals and conditionally driven by input operations. Outputs are provided for reading data from the coprocessor and for cache control. Fault information is updated based on the input fault signals. In debugging mode, coprocessor operations are logged for analysis.
