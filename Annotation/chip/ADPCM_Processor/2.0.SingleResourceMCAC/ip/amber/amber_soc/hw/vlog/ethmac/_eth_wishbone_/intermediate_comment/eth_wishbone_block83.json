    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code functions to latch data for transmission, specifically operating as a synchronous transit-flop. It updates based on positive edges of the MTxClk signal or resets via the Reset signal. Upon receiving a Reset signal, the 32-bit TxDataLatched register is cleared. Else, if either 'TxStartFrm_sync2' is asserted and 'TxStartFrm' is not, or when 'TxUsedData' & 'Flop' are true with different 'TxByteCnt' setups (either being 2'h3 or 2'h0), 'TxDataLatched' takes the value of the 'TxData_wb' register."
