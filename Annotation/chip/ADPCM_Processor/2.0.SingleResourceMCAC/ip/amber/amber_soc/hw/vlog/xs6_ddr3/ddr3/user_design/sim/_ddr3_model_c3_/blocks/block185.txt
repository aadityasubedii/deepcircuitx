Comment: 
This block schedules the activation of the `dqs_odd_receiver` function based on the rising edge of `dqs_odd[ 6]`. The `always @` construct is monitoring the `dqs_odd[ 6]` signal. When a positive edge (transition from low to high) is detected on the element 6 of the `dqs_odd` array, the `dqs_odd_receiver(6)` function is triggered and executed.
