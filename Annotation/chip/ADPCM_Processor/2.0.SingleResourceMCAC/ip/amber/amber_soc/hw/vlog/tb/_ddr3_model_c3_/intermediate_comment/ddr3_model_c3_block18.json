    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to trigger a specific function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' upon a falling edge of the signal 'dqs_in[14]'. It uses an 'always' construct to continuously monitor for the negative edge of 'dqs_in[14]', signaling a switch from high to low. When this negative transition occurs in the signal, the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' is executed, with the signal index '14' passed as a parameter. This setup is principally used in clocked systems for synchronization and timing checks."
