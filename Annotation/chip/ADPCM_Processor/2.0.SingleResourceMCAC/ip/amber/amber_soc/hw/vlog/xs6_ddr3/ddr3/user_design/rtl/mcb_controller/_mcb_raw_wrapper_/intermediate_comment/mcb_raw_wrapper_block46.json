    "block_comment": "This block is a configuration condition control for a memory interface generator (MIG) with particular port settings (B64_B32_B32). It assigns various command signals to the MIG from port 0, such as enable, clock, memory address, bank address, column address, burst length, etc, when the port enable bit is set. The assignment of command burst length is interesting because it is provided with a condition on the corresponding instruction signal bit and burst length LSB."
