This block of code serves as a state control for a command-ready (cmd_rdyD) flag under certain conditions. Upon receiving a rising edge clock signal, it first checks if the reset signal (rst_i[0]) is set, and if true, sets the command-ready signal to 1 with a delay of #TCQ. If not, it then checks if the command start signal (cmd_startD) has been received and if the bl_i is equal to 1, the command-ready signal is again set to 1 with #TCQ delay. If bl_i is not equal to 1, the command-ready signal is made 0 with #TCQ delay. Finally, if neither reset nor command start signals are active, it checks if a user burst count equals 2 and the FIFO queue is not full, and if both conditions meet, it sets the command-ready signal to 1 with a delay of #TCQ.
