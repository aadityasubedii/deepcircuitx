    "block_comment": "This Verilog block performs asynchronous data reception. It triggers on the positive edge of either the `MRxClk` or `Reset` signals. In case of a reset, it initializes all outputs to their default values. Otherwise, it updates the `LatchedByte` with the combined lower 4 bits of the `MRxD` and the upper 4 bits from the previous `LatchedByte` value. The `DelayData` is updated with the least significant bit of the `StateData` signal. If the `GenerateRxValid` signal is high, `RxData_d` stores the `LatchedByte` value ANDed with the 'OR'd value of all `StateData` bits, otherwise, if `DelayData` is low, `RxData_d` is reset to zero. The `RxData` output is always updated with the current `RxData_d` value."
