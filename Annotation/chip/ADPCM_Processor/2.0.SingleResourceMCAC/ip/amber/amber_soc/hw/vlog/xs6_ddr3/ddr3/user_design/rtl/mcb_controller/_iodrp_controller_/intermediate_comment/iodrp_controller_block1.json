    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a state machine transition in a synchronous process for hardware design. The block is triggered on every positive edge of the DRP_CLK signal, presumably a clock signal. There's a reset condition that whenever a stop signal (sync_rst) is received, it resets the state machine to the READY state. Otherwise, state transitions to the value of nextstate, which is presumably determined elsewhere in the code."
