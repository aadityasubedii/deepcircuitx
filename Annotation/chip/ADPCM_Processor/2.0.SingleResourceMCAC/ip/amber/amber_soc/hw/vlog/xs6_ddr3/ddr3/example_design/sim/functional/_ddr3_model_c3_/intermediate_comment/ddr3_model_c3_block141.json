    "block_comment": "This block effectively performs a timing check on the 7th bit of the input data array 'dm_in'. It uses the event-driven always construct in Verilog, causing the 'dm_timing_check' function to be called every time the 7th bit of the 'dm_in' signal changes. This implementation ensures that any changes on the target bit can be promptly detected and handled."
