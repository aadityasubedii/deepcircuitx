    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code implements an arithmetic shift right (ASR) operation. The `asr_out` is computed based on various conditions, primarily checking the shift_amt and input's sign bit (i_in[31]). If the shift amount is zero, the output is determined by the sign bit and `i_carry_in`. However, if it is 1, 2, or 3, different bits of `i_in` are selected and filled with duplicates of the sign bit."
