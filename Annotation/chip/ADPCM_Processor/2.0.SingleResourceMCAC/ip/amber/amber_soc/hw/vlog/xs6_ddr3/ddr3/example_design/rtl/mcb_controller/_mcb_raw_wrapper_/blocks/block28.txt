Comment: 
This block of Verilog code implements an OSERDES2 (Output Serializer/Deserializer) module named 'ioi_cas_0'. This module helps in serialization of parallel data for transmission at a higher rate. It has been configured in single-ended output mode, functioning at defined data rates for OQ (output data Bus) and OT (output test data). Notably, it uses a data width of 2 and operates in master mode. Inputs to this module include the system clock(ioclk0), data to be serialized (cas_90), and a reset signal (int_sys_rst). The module outputs the serialized data at the 'OQ' port. Unused SHIFTOUT, SHIFTIN, clocks and test signal ports are tied to ground.
