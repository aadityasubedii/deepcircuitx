    "block_comment": "This block is used to execute an operation whenever there's a change in the 'we_n_in' signal. Specifically, it calls the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function with the input argument '3'. The sensitivity to 'we_n_in' means that this block responds to both rising and falling edges of 'we_n_in', triggering 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function whenever any edge is detected. This is usually done to ensure there are no timing conflicts when dealing with commands and addresses in memory-related operations."
