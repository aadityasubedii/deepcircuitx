This block defines an afifo (Asynchronous FIFO) used for data read, named rd_mdata_fifo. It is synchronized with clock clk_i, and it's reset using signal rst_i[0]. The data is written into the FIFO by applying data_valid_i signal on wr_en and data_i on wr_data. The reading of data is achieved by applying rd_mdata_en signal on rd_en, and the output is observed on rd_v6_mdata. The FIFO emptiness is flagged by rd_mdata_fifo_empty signal. The FIFO size is predefined to be 32 with a width defined by DWIDTH.
