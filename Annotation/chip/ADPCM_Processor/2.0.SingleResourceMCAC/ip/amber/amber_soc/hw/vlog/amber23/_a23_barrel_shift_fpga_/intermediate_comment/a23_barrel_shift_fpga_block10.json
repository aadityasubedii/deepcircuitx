    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is performing a bit slice operation. Specifically, it is taking a 32-bit slice from the 'rot_prod' variable, starting from the least significant bit (LSB) to the 31st bit, and assigning it to the variable 'p_l'. The '[31:0]' notation represents the bit range for the slice operation, indicating that all bits from the 0th to the 31st are included. This operation could be utilized in different digital designs, often used for shifting or rotating bits, extracting or masking individual bits, or sections of a larger data word."
