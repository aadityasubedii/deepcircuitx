    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for checking the timing of data strobe (dqs) signals upon their negative edge. The implementation employs an always block triggered on the negative edge of the 23rd bit of `dqs_in[]` array, which subsequently calls the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function for the same bit. The function's job is to ensure that the dqs signal transitions effectively and meets timing conditions."
