    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is for designing a synchronous reset logic for an interrupt mechanism. The operation of this block is contingent on the rising edge (posedge) of two signals - the RxClk or the Reset. When the Reset signal is active, it sets the ResetRxCIrq_sync1 signal to low, executing a synchronous reset. Otherwise, the ResetRxCIrq_sync1 signal takes the value of SetRxCIrq_sync2, effectively forwarding this signal synchronously with the RxClk. This is often used to reduce the risk of metastability and synchronization issues in digital circuits."
