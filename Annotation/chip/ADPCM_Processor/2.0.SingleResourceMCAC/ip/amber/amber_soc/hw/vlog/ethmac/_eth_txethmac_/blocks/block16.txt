Comment: 
This code block is responsible for managing the transmission process of the system. During each rising edge of the MTxClk or when a reset signal occurs, the block checks the Reset flag. If reset occurs, it immediately sets the TxDone flag to zero with a delay of Tp time units. During normal operation (i.e., no Reset), it inspects the TxStartFrm and StatusLatch flags. If a transmission start frame is signaled and StatusLatch is not, it resets the TxDone flag. If transmission start is completed, indicated by the StartTxDone flag, it sets TxDone to one with a Tp delay.
