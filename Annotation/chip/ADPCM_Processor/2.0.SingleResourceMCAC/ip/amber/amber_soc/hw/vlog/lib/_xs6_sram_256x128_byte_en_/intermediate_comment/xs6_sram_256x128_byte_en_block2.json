    "block_comment": "This block of code is a generator that instantiates four dual-port RAM modules. In each iteration of the loop, a RAMB8BWER instance is created with both data widths set to 36 and the mode defined as SDP (Simple Dual Port). These instances use a common clock signal and the write enable signal controls the operation mode. The address signals are formed by concatenating the input address with 5 bits of 0s. The write enable and data signals use slices of input signals ensuring that different portions of data are directed to different RAM instances. Additional control signals are set to constant logical low (0) as they might not be required in this context."
