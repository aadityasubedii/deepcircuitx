This block manages the conditions to set the flag for writing incoming data to the FIFO. It uses a combination of bitwise AND and OR operators on the control and status signals. The flag goes high when (1) a valid data is ready to be read, not the starting frame, within the reception window, and there is no byte count, (2) a valid pointer LSB is reset at the beginning of reception, or (3) the shifting operation will end soon and it's the last byte without any remaining byte count.
