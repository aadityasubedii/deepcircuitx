This block of code invokes a timing check on data queue input (dq_in) at the 61st bit. By using the always @ construct, the block ensures that the procedure dq_timing_check is triggered whenever there's a change in the value of dq_in[60]. Essentially, this is used to maintain data integrity, by constant monitoring for edge transitions at this specific bit of the dq_in.
