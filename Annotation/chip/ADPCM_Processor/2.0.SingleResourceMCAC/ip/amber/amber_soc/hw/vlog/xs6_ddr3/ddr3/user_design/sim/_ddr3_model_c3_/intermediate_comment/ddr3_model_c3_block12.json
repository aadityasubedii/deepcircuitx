    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for triggering a timing check whenever a positive edge is detected on the 21st bit of the 'dqs_in' signal. The hardware implementation is done using an 'always' block in Verilog which is sensitive to the positive transition of the selected bit in 'dqs_in'. As soon as the specified bit of the 'dqs_in' signal transitions from low to high, the procedure 'dqs_neg_timing_check' is called with '20' as an argument."
