    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for handling the interrupt request (irq) triggered by a transmission complete (txc) signal in a system. It operates synchronously with a clock (Clk) or a reset (Reset) signal. When a Reset signal is received, the irq_txc is cleared. If a SetTxCIrq signal is enabled, the irq_txc is set after a propagation delay defined by Tp. If there are valid interrupt source writes (indicated by the first bit of INT_SOURCE_Wr) and a specific DataIn condition (the sixth bit of DataIn is set), the irq_txc is cleared after a propagation delay Tp. This execution priority is ensured by cascading if-else statements."
