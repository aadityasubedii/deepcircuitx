    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a hardware module that generates serial data streams from parallel address lines. The for-loop is iterating through all address lines, creating an OSERDES2 (Output Serializer) instance for each one. It achieves the serialization by assigning the same address line bit to D1 and D2, while D3 and D4 are kept constant, which indicates that it operates in a 2-bit-wide data path. The operation of the individual OSERDES2 unit is controlled through the CLK0 signal (IOCLOCK0), the IOCE signal (PLL_CE_0), and the RST signal (int_sys_rst). All the other control signals of OSERDES2 are held constant at \"1'b0\" which is the low logic state."
