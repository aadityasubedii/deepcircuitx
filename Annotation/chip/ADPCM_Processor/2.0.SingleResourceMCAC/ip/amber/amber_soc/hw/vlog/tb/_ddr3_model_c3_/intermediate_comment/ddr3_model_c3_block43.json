    "block_comment": "This block initiates a negative-edge triggered DQS (Data-strobe signal) timing check. It uses the 'always' block to continuously monitor the 23rd bit (index 22) of the 'dqs_in' signal array. Whenever a transition from high to low (negative edge) occurs in this bit, it calls the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function with '22' as an argument, to check the timing constraints."
