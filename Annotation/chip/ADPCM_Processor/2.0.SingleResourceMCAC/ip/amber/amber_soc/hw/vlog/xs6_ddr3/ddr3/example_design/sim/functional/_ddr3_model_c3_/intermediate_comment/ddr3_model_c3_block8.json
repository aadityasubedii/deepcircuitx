    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for invoking the dqs_neg_timing_check function whenever there is a positive edge transition on the 25th bit of the dqs_in signal. The function is event-driven and specifically tied to the positive edge transition of the 25th bit of the dqs_in array, meaning it is executed whenever there is a shift from low to high on this specific bit. This block is integral in managing timing checks related to the DDR signaling, particularly for the function linked with the negative edge of the DQS signal."
