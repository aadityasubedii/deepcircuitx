    "block_comment": "The function 'floor' in the given Verilog RTL block is designed to return the largest integer less than or equal to a given number. This function takes in a 'real' type input 'number'. If the input 'number' is smaller than its integer conversion using the '$rtoi' system function, then that integer value minus one is assigned to 'floor', otherwise, 'floor' is directly assigned the input 'number'. The function thus leverages conditional statements and the '$rtoi' system function to achieve its purpose."
