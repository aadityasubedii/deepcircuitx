    "block_comment": "The block assigns a value to the output variable 'o_rn' based on the value of the input selection variable 'i_rn_sel'. The output is a chosen signal from 16 possible options (r0_out to r15_out_rn), with the selection based on the 4-bit value of the input. This is a multiplexer implementation using Verilog's ternary conditional operator ('?:'). Different 'rn_out's are selected as per the 4-bit binary equivalent from 'i_rn_sel' and output is assigned to 'o_rn'."
