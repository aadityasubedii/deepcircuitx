Comment: 
This block of code is basically assigning the signal MCB_SYSRST the value of the Pre_SYSRST signal. The assign keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignments which makes a variable take on the value of an expression continuously. In this instance, the MCB_SYSRST output is taking the value of the variable Pre_SYSRST.
