    "block_comment": "This block serves to select the type of clock input: either differential or single-ended. If C_INPUT_CLK_TYPE parameter is set to \"DIFFERENTIAL\", a differential input buffer (IBUFGDS) is instantiated, which accepts sys_clk_p (positive clock signal) and sys_clk_n (negative clock signal), and outputs to sys_clk_ibufg with the differential termination enabled. Alternatively, if C_INPUT_CLK_TYPE equals \"SINGLE_ENDED\", an IBUFG buffer is used to interface single-ended clock input (sys_clk) to sys_clk_ibufg. The 'generate' and 'endgenerate' keywords are used to enable conditional hardware generation depending on the parameter."
