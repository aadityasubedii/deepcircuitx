Comment: 
The block of code generates a clock signal inverse to the input clock signal. Whenever there is a positive edge in the input clock signal named 'ck_n_in', it triggers the code inside the block which effectively creates an inversion of the clock signal. This inversion is then assigned to 'diff_ck'. This code is useful when you need an inverted clock signal for processes triggered on opposite clock phases.
