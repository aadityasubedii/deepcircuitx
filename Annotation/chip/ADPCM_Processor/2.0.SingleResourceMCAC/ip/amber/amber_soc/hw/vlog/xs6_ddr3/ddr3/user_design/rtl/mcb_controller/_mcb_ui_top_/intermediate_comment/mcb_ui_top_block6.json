    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a conditional generate statement pertaining to memory controller synchronization and AXI interface management. If C_S5_AXI_ENABLE is not activated, the code block will assign a series of signals to the memory controller (MCB) inputs and inspect status from the MCB outputs. If C_S5_AXI_ENABLE is active, the code block supplements the similar base operation with enabling AXI interface by masking AXI addressing and employing 'mcb_ui_top_synch' for synchronization. Furthermore, a comprehensive AXI memory controller block 'axi_mcb' is instantiated for memory interaction with tailored configurations. The design details include signal assignments, conditional logic, instantiation, and synchronization which collaboratively achieve memory arbitration and transactions in different scenarios.\n"
