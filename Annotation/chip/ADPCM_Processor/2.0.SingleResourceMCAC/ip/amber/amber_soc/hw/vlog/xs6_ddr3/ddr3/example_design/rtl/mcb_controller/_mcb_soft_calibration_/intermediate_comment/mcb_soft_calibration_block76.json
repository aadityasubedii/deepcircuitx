    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for setting the reset condition (Rst_condition1) based on the value of the reset counter (RstCounter). Implementation-wise, it utilizes an active high clock signal with every positive edge (UI_CLK) to sample the value of the RstCounter. If RstCounter is greater than or equal to the maximum threshold (TZQINIT_MAXCNT), Rst_condition1 is set to 1 (True), otherwise, it is set to 0 (False)."
