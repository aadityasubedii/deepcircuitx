    "block_comment": "This block acts as a state controller for the ShiftEnded_rck signal, which determines the end of a shift operation. Upon a positive edge signal on either the Master Receiver Clock (MRxClk) or Reset, different activities occur. If the Reset signal is high, ShiftEnded_rck is set to low, effectively ending the shift process. If the receiver is not in abort mode (RxAbort is low), the request to write the receiver data to FIFO is set, and StartShiftWillEnd is anticipated, it sets ShiftEnded_rck to high, starting the shift. However, if a receiver aborts (RxAbort is high) or the conditions of ShiftEndedSync_c1 and ShiftEndedSync_c2 are met, ShiftEnded_rck is reset to low. This structure helps control the shift process based on key conditions."
