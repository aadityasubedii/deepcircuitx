This block of code is responsible for the initial setup of opening memory bank files in Verilog. It takes an input of the bank directory path via a command-line argument and defaults to "/tmp" if no directory is specified. The block then iterates over a predefined number of banks and opens the corresponding bank file for each one by calling the 'open_bank_file' function.
