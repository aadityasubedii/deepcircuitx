This block of code is used to control the MulticastOK signal in a receiving unit of a network protocol. If an active edge is detected on the Reset signal or the MRxClk (received clock), the code is executed. Under reset condition or at the end of frame reception (RxEndFrm) or when frame reception is aborted (RxAbort), the MulticastOK signal is set to zero after a propagation delay (Tp). However, if reception is successful with good CRC (CrcHashGood) and the received signal is a multicast, MulticastOK takes the value of HashBit, again after a time period of Tp.
