Comment: 
This line of code checks if the latched random value is equal to zero. It implements this functionality by assigning the boolean output of the comparison between `RandomLatched` and `10'h0` (Zero in hexadecimal notation) to `RandomEq0`. This comparator will return a high or '1' when `RandomLatched` is equal to zero, otherwise, it will return a low or '0'.
