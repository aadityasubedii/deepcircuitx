    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code outlines the control flow of a Data Rate Processing (DRP) work cycle. The cycle operates on a positive edge clock (DRP_CLK). When the machine enters the Address Phase (ADDR_PHASE), it activates the DRP_ADD and DRP_CS signals. The signal MCB_UIREAD is activated during the Data Phase only if the RD_NOT_WRITE_REG flag is high, implying an ongoing read operation. When the machine is in the READY state, DRP_BKST is tied to the USE_BROADCAST flag, enabling or disabling broadcast as required."
