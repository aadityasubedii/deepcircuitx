    "block_comment": "This block of code is implementing a counter with respect to UI_CLK's positive edge that is used in the dynamic calibration pre-start state. When the STATE signal is set to 'START_DYN_CAL_PRE', synchronous to each UI_CLK rising edge, the 'pre_sysrst_cnt' counter is incremented by 1. In any other state, the 'pre_sysrst_cnt' counter is reset to 0. This is probably part of a state machine managing system reset operations during dynamic calibration processes."
