Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for the assignment of values related to the third wishbone bus slave (s3). It achieves this by mapping the master's address, data, and selection signal directly to the respective s3 signals. The write enable, cycle and strobe signals for s3 are conditionally assigned based on whether the current selected slave is '3' (4'd3 in signed decimal notation). If the current slave is '3', these signals take the respective values from the master's signals; otherwise, they are set to '0' (1'd0).
