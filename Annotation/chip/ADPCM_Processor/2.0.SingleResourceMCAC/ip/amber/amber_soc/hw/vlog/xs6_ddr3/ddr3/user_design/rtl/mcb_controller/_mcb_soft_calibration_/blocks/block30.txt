Comment: 
This block of code describes a synchronous flip-flop logic under the trigger of positive edge of UI_CLK. The system state, 'DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL', is updated at each positive edge of UI_CLK and is set to be true when 'DQS_DELAY_INITIAL' is not zero OR the state machine is in 'DONE' state, AND it's ensured that the 'MCB_UODONECAL' calibration has been done. It would primarily serve to signal the completion of some software and hardware calibration tasks under specific conditions.
