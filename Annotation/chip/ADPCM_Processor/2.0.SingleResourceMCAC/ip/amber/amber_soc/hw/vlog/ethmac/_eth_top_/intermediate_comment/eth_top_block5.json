    "block_comment": "This block of code handles reset and pause request signals in a hardware design. Triggering on the positive edge of the main clock or reset, it assigns a default '0' to TPauseRq if a reset is detected, else it computes a logical AND between the synchronized request signal TxPauseRq_sync2 and the negation of TxPauseRq_sync3, assuring tasks pause when required.\n"
