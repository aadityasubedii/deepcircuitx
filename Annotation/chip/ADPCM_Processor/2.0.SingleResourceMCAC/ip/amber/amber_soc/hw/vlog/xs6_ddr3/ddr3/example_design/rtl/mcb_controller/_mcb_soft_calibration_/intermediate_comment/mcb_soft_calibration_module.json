    "module": "Module-level comment: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), handling I/O termination and DQS delay calibration. It uses a state machine to sequentially adjust termination resistances, configure DQS delays, and optimize signal integrity. The module iteratively refines calibration settings based on measured values, supports dynamic recalibration, and manages self-refresh operations. It interfaces with IODRP controllers and the MCB to apply calibration settings and respond to system conditions like resets and PLL lock status."
