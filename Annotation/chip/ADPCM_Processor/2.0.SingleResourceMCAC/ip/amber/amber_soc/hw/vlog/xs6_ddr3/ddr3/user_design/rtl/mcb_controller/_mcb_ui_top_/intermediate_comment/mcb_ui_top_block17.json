    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is primarily used for signal assignment for different operations. The block assigns input and output signals for command (cmd), write (wr) and read (rd) operations, controlling how different components communicate within the hardware. It assigns enable signals, clock signals, instruction data, block length, byte address for the cmd operation. In the case of wr operation, it assigns enable signals, clock signals, write masks, data, and status signals (full, empty, count, underrun, and error). For the rd operation, it assigns enable signals, clock signals, data, and status signals (full, empty, count, and overflow)."
