    "block_comment": "This block of code monitors the data line input (dq_in) at the 34th bit using an always block. When there's a change on this specific bit, it triggers the function \"dq_timing_check\" with the same bit index as an argument. The block provides a mechanism for data integrity check on a specific bit of the incoming data to ensure correct synchronization and timing."
