    "block_comment": "This block of code triggers a function called `dm_timing_check` whenever the 15th bit (index 14) of the `dm_in` bus changes. Specifically, it uses the always @() construct to monitor changes to `dm_in[14]`, and executes `dm_timing_check(14)` whenever such a change is detected."
