Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable cache for low-latency data access in a microarchitecture. It supports multiple ways, configurable cache lines, and words per line. The cache uses state machines to handle read, write, and flush operations. It implements set-associative caching with a pseudo-random replacement policy and exclusive access mode. The module interfaces with a Wishbone bus for memory transactions and supports burst reads for efficient data fetching. It includes separate tag and data RAMs for each way, along with control logic for cache hit detection and data selection.
