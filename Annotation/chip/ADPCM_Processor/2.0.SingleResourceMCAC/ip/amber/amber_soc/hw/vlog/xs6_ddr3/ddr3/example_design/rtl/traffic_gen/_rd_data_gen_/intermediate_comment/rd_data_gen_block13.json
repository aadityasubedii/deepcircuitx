    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the state of the variable 'next_count_is_one' based on specific conditions. The state of 'next_count_is_one' gets set to 1 when 'user_burst_cnt' equals 2 and 'data_rdy_i' (indicating data is ready) is true; otherwise, it sets 'next_count_is_one' to 0. This signaling mechanism is clock-driven, as changes are triggered on the positive edge of the input clock signal 'clk_i'."
