Comment: 
This block of code handles the incrementation of byte counts in a specific communication protocol receiving system. When a valid receiving signal (RxValid) is within the detection window (DetectionWindow), the byte count (ByteCntEq18) is not already at its maximum value (18), and either the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is not enabled (DlyCrcEn), or the CRC counter (DlyCrcCnt) is at least 4 (element 2 of DlyCrcCnt), the byte count increments (IncrementByteCnt).
