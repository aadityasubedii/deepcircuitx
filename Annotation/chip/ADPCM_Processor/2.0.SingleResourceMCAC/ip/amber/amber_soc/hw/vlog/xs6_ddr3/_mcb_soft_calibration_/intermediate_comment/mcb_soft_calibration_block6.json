    "block_comment": "This block of code controls a state machine and interfaces with a memory reading system. Firstly, it enables a counter and checks if a condition (count less than 38) is met. If so, the system state moves to 'WAIT9', otherwise it advances to 'READ_MAX_VALUE'. Then, in the 'READ_MAX_VALUE' state, it sets a valid command flag, assigns the max value to the memory cell address, and sets read mode. A backup of the 'Max_Value' is also maintained. Depending on the status of 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N', the system either remains in the same state or moves to 'WAIT10'."
