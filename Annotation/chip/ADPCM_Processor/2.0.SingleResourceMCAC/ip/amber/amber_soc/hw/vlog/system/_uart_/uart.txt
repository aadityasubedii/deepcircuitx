Module-level comment: This UART module implements a configurable serial communication interface with Wishbone bus compatibility. It supports both transmission and reception of data using FIFOs, handles flow control (CTS/RTS), and generates interrupts. The module uses separate state machines for TX and RX operations, implements configurable baud rates, and provides various control registers for UART configuration. It manages data buffering, timing, and error handling for reliable serial communication.
