The block triggers a timing check on the 51st bit of the 'dq_in' input signal array. This action (timing check) is performed whenever there are any changes in the 51st bit of the 'dq_in' array by calling the 'dq_timing_check' function with 50 as an argument. This process happens in an 'always' loop, making sure that every change in the state of the 51st bit invokes the timing check.
