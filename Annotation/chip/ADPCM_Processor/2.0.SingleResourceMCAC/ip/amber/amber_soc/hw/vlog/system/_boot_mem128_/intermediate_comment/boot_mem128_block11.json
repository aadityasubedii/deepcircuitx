    "block_comment": "This block is a state controller for initiating a read process in a synchronous system. On the rising edge of the input writeback clock (`i_wb_clk`), it checks if a new read sequence is being commanded via `start_read`. If so, it extends the signal `start_read_r` while pre-filling three bits with 0s. Conversely, if an acknowledgment signal `o_wb_ack` is received, it resets `start_read_r` to 0, indicating that the read operation is done. If neither condition is met, it simply shifts `start_read_r` to the left and appends `start_read`, effectively creating a delay line for the start_read signal."
