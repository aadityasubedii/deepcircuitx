    "block_comment": "This function locates a memory address within a previously used block of memory. The function takes an address as an input and initializes the return index as zero. It then loops over every cell in the memory block via its built-in for-loop, checking if the address of each memory cell (address[memory_index]) matches the input address. If a match is found, the function will return an index of 1 and terminate. If no match is found after checking all memory cells, the function ends and returns the initial index of 0, thereby indicating the lack of a match."
