    "block_comment": "The block of code controls data transmission based on two signals, MTxClk and Reset. It functions as a type of sequential logic, which updates on the positive edge of MTxClk or Reset. If the reset signal is received (high), it sets the TxUsedData to low with a delay specified by Tp. In all other cases (i.e., if Reset is not high), it transfers the value of StartData to TxUsedData with a Tp delay, effectively controlling data jamming in transmission based on the status of Reset and StartData signals."
