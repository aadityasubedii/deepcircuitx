    "block_comment": "The block of code, a task in Verilog RTL, sets the latency for read and write operations. It does this by checking if `al` is zero, and if so, setting `additive_latency` to zero; otherwise, `additive_latency` is set to the difference of `cas_latency` and `al`. After this condition check, the total read and write latencies are calculated by adding `additive_latency` to `cas_latency` and `cas_write_latency` respectively."
