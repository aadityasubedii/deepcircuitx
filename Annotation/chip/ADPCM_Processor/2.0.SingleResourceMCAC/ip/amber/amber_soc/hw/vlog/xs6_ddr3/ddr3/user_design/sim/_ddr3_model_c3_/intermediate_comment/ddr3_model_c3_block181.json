    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a flip-flop that triggers on the positive edge of the tenth element of the 'dqs_odd' array. When there is a positive edge detect in 'dqs_odd[10]', it calls the 'dqs_odd_receiver' function with '10' as an argument. This technique is typically used for sampling or memory operations where state needs to be stored or processed on specific timing conditions."
