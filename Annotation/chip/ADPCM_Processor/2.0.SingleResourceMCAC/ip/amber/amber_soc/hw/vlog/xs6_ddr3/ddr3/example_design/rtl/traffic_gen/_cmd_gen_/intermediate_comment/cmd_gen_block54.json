    "block_comment": "This block in Verilog RTL code serves as a conditional statement generator in compile time. Specifically, it checks if the command pattern is not equivalent to \"CGEN_BRAM\". If this condition is satisfied, the code block labelled 'cv2' is executed. The block uses the 'generate' keyword to enable compiler-time control flow, and the 'if' statement to set the condition for action of the encapsulated code block. The execution of the labeled code will depend entirely on the command pattern input during compile-time."
