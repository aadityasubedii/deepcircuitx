    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for monitoring a particular bit (11th bit) of the 'addr_in' bus and invoking the function 'cmd_addr_timing_check' whenever this specific bit changes its value. To implement this, an 'always' block in Verilog is used which provides a functionality similar to an event-driven interrupt system. Here, the event to be monitored is any logical change (either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) in the 11th bit of 'addr_in'. When such a change is detected, the function 'cmd_addr_timing_check' is called with an argument of '17'."
