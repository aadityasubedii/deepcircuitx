    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) addresses and chip selects, as well as setting the broadcast option. At every positive edge of the DRP clock, it sets the DRP address register and the DRP chip select register based on the current state of the finite state machine, indicating if it is in the address phase or data phase. Additionally, when the state machine is in the Ready state, the code sets the DRP broadcast option, which is determined by the `use_broadcast` variable."
