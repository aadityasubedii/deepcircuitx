    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for generating a range of boolean evaluation signals based on the current value of ByteCnt. These boolean values reflect whether ByteCnt equals specific numbers (from 0 to 7), is greater than 2, less than 7, or has reached its maximum value. The block operates by assigning the results of these comparisons to predicate variables such as ByteCntEq0, ByteCntEq1 etc., through ByteCntEq7, ByteCntGreat2, ByteCntSmall7, and ByteCntMax."
