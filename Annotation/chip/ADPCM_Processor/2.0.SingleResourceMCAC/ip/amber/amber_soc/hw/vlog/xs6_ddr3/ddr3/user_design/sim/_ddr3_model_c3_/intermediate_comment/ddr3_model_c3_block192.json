    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a task that manages the reception of data from a DQS (Data Strobe) line in a memory interface for odd numbered DQS lines. It employs the application of bit masks to extract and handle data bits from incoming data via a specific DQS line. The procedure deduces the specific bits from the `dq_in` input corresponding to the DQS line identified by `i` and proceeds with manipulating the `dq_in_neg` data according to the value of `dqs_odd[i]`. Additionally, `dm_in_neg[i]` value is determined based on the `tdqs_en` signal indicating whether or not the data mask is enabled."
