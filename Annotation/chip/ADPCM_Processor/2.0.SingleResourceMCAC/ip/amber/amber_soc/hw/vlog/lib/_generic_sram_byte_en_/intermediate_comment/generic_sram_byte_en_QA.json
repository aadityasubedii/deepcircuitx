It uses the specified DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH parameters, essentially representing the width of stored data and the number of addresses respectively. Features of this module include the ability to write to specific byte addresses if the write enable is high, controlled by the byte enable signal. It also reads data from a memory address and sets this as an output. However, when the write enable is activated, the output data is held to 0. The operation is all synchronized to the rising edge of the input clock signal i_clk."

All the operations are triggered at the rising edge of this clock signal.\n\n2. i_write_data (DATA_WIDTH wide): This is the data to be written into the memory. It comprises of DATA_WIDTH number of bits.\n\n3. i_write_enable: This is a signal to enable write operation. When this signal is high, data is written into the memory.\n\n4. i_address (ADDRESS_WIDTH wide): This is the address input to specify the location in memory where data is to be written or read from.\n\n5. i_byte_enable (DATA_WIDTH/8 wide): This signal allows enabling or disabling of individual bytes within the data to be written to memory. If the respective bit is set, that corresponding byte of the data is written to memory.\n\nOutput ports: \n\n1. o_read_data (DATA_WIDTH wide): This is the output of the module which reads out the data from a specified memory location. When a write operation is enabled, this output is maintained at zero.\n\nExplanation: The above input and output ports help in facilitating 'write' and 'read' operations from the emulated memory. Writing to the memory is conditioned by 'i_write_enable' and 'i_byte_enable' signals. The 'i_address' input decides where this data is to be written. Data is read from the memory location pointed by 'i_address' when 'i_write_enable' is not active, and provided to 'o_read_data' output."
