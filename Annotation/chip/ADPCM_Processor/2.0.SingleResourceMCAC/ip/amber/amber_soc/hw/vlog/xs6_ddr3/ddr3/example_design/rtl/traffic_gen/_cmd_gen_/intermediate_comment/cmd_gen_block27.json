    "block_comment": "The code block handles the updating of the 'end_addr_r' register at the positive edge of the input clock 'clk_i'. The 'end_addr_r' register is updated with the decreases from the 'end_addr_i' input by subtracting an offset generated by dividing 'DWIDTH' by 8 and multiplying the result with 'fixed_bl_i'. This is then incremented by 1, and the update occurs after the delay specified by 'TCQ'. This operation is important for setting up the correct address range for a data retrieval or manipulation task in the system."
