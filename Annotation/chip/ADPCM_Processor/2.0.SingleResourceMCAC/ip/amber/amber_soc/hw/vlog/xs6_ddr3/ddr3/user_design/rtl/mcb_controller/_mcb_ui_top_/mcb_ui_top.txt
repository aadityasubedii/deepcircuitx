Module-level comment: This module implements a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) supporting up to 6 configurable ports with AXI or native interfaces. It manages clock domains, arbitration, and interfaces with the lower-level memory controller. The module utilizes a BUFPLL_MCB for clock management, an mcb_raw_wrapper for core memory operations, and conditional instantiation of AXI interfaces for each port. It handles various memory types, configurations, and timing requirements, providing a flexible design for memory access in hardware systems.
