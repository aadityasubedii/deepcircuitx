    "block_comment": "This block is a clocked digital logic block responsible for managing the starting frame for transmission (TxStartFrm). The block is triggered on the rising edge of the MTxClk or Reset signals. On a Reset, it sets TxStartFrm to 0 with a delay specified by Tp. Otherwise, when TxStartFrm_sync2 is high, it sets TxStartFrm to 1, signifying the start of a new transmission frame. Finally, if neither Reset nor TxStartFrm_sync2 are active, it can reset TxStartFrm to 0, indicating the end of the frame under either retry conditions (TxRetry is high but wasn't in the previous cycle), or abort conditions (TxAbort is high but wasn't in the previous cycle)."
