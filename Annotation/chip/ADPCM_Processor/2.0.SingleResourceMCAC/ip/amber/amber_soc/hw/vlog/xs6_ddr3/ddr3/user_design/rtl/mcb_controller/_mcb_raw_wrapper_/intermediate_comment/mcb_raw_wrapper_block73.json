    "block_comment": "This block of code enforces the read-only nature of Port 5. It monitors the command input and configurations of Port 5 and triggers an error message if a write command is attempted when the port is configured for read-only operations. The conditional statement checks if the port configuration is \"R32\", signalling a read-only configuration, and whether a command enable is triggered. Additionally, the specific command instruction that constitutes a write operation is also checked. If these conditions are met, an error message is displayed and the program execution is forcibly halted."
