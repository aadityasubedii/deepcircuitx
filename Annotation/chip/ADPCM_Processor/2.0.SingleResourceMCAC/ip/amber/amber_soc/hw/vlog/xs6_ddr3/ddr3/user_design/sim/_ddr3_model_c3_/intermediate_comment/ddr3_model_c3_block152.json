    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to act as a timing control mechanism for command addresses. The block utilises the 13th bit of the address input for detecting changes and this triggers the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function with a delay parameter of 19. As this is placed within an 'always' block, it assures that each change in the significant bit of address leads to the function call, enabling fine control over the timing of commands based on the given address."
