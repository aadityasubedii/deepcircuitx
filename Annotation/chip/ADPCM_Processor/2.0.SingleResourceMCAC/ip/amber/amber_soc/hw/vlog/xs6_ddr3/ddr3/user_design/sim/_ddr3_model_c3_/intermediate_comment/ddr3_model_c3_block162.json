    "block_comment": "This block of code responds to changes on the third bit (from the right, starting at 0) of the \"addr_in\" input signal. The functionality of this Verilog RTL block is to invoke the \"cmd_addr_timing_check\" function whenever the specified bit of \"addr_in\" changes, passing '9' as an argument to the function. The specific logic for how this action is carried out is encapsulated within the \"cmd_addr_timing_check\" function, which is not defined within this block of code."
