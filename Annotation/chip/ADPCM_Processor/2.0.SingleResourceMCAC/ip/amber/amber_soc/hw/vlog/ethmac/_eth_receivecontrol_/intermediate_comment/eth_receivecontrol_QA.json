The main functionalities include checking the validity of received frames (AddressOK, TypeLengthOK and OpCodeOK) according to Ethernet protocols, detecting Pause control frames (ReceivedPauseFrmWAddr), and handling Pause-Time value defined for flow control (AssembledTimerValue, LatchedTimerValue, and PauseTimer). The Pause signal is updated based on system status. This module also maintains slots for Pause-Time and decrement Pause-Timer accordingly. It effectively controls the flow of incoming data and pauses transmission if required, as per Eth standards."
