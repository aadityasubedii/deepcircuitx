    "block_comment": "This block is a condition-based hardware generator, which activates if a certain type of memory, DDR2, is used in the design. The code uses Verilog's built-in 'generate' and 'if' controls for conditional compilation and instantiation during synthesis. The nomenclature 'gen_cketrain_a' indicates the label which can be cross-referred in the design hierarchy."
