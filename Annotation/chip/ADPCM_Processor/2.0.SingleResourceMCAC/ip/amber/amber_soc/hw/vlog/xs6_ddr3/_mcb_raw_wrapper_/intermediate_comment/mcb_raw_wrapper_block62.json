    "block_comment": "This block is an interface assignment for a command/configuration bus within a memory interface controller (MIG). When the Conditional compilation flag `C_PORT_ENABLE[5]` is high, the port 5 uses direct assign association between MIG and designating signals (like `p5_cmd_*`). It covers parameters such as clock, enable signal, row address, bank address, column address, instruction set and burst length. Otherwise, if `C_PORT_ENABLE[5]` is low, it assigns a disabled ('b0) to all the MIG signals, essentially turning off the bus interface for port 5."
