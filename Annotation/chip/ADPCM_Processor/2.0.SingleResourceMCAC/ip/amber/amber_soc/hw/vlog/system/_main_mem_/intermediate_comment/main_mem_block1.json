    "block_comment": "The block assigns the output wire `o_wb_ack` based on the AND operation of the `i_wb_stb` input and the OR operation of `start_write` and `start_read_d2` signals. This implies that `o_wb_ack` will be asserted when a wishbone strobe signal is active (indicating an ongoing read or write operation), and either a write operation has started, or a second delay read operation starts. The use of the logical AND and OR operations ensures the desired signal behaviors in different conditions."
