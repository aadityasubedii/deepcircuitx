The block handles read requests in a hardware design. It operates on a positive edge of the provided i_clk signal, updating internal states according to the status of start_read signal. Two pipelines stages, start_read_d1 and start_read_d2, are used to store the state of the start_read signal and delay it for synchronization. When a read start is detected (start_read_d1 is high), the block reads data from rd_data to wb_rdata128. The logic ensures proper sequence of operations with precise timing control.
