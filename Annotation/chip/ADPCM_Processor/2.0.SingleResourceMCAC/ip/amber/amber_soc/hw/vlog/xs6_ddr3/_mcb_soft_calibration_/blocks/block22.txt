Comment: 
This Verilog code block performs writing to memory cell operations with termination adjustment. The operations are carried out by assigning 'NTerm' to the 'IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR', setting the 'IODRPCTRLR_R_WB' in write mode, and initiating the 'IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA' with the adjusted termination value 'N_Term_s'. The addressed IOI is 'IOI_UDQS_CLK', and the 'MCB_CMD_VALID' signal is set high indicating that the command is valid. The state transitions to 'UDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM' if 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N' is true, else it shifts to the 'UDQS_CLK_N_TERM_WAIT' state, indicating the memory cell operation is in progress or in the wait state for next operation.
