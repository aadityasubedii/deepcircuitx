Module-level comment: The rd_data_gen module generates read data for SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6 digital systems, determined by a FAMILY parameter. It takes a set of inputs such as clock, reset signals, PRBS seed, data mode, command validity, fixed data, address, burst length, data readiness, etc., to generate outputs including command ready, last word, user burst count validity, data validity, and read data. The functionality is achieved through internal signals controlling the operations and instantiation of specific data generator modules. It uses clock-triggered processes for command handling, data transmission, and burst tracking.
