    "block_comment": "This code block handles read requests from a Wishbone bus to certain designated registers in an Amber processor design. On the rising edge of the clock signal, if a read request is observed, the block assigns the corresponding register data to the Wishbone data output lines based on the address given. This is implemented using a case statement where each case corresponds to the address of a different register. For example, if the address matches with `AMBER_TEST_STATUS`, `test_status_reg` value is assigned to `wb_rdata32`. If no match is found, a default hex value `32'haabbccdd` is set to `wb_rdata32`."
