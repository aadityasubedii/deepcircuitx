    "block_comment": "The block of code is a data latch for a receiver in a Verilog system. The data that is received (RxData) is stored in RxDataLatched1 in chunks of eight bits at a time, either on the beginning of the frame or during the window of receiving data, depending on certain conditions. The storing of data is dependent on the value of RxPointerLSB_rst or RxByteCnt, leading to various divisions of RxDataLatched1 being updated with RxData. If a reset signal is received, RxDataLatched1 is reset to 0 for allowing new data storage."
