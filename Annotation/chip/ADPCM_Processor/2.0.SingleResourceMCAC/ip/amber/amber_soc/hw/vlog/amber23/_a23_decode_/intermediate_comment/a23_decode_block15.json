    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles state-specific assignments for the SWAP_WRITE control state when an instruction is executed. It sets several variables like 'barrel_shift_data_sel_nxt', 'address_sel_nxt', 'write_data_wen_nxt', and 'data_access_exec_nxt'. Additionally, depending on the state of 'instruction[22]', 'byte_enable_sel_nxt' is conditionally assigned, and the 'pc_wen_nxt' value is reset when an instruction is executed. Finally, 'pre_fetch_instruction_wen' is unconditionally set to 1, indicating that the next instruction fetch command is allowed."
