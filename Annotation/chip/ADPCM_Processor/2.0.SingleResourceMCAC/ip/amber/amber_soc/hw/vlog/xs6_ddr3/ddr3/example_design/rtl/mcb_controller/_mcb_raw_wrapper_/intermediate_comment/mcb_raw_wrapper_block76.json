    "block_comment": "This block of code is a data integrity check for command inputs of port 4. It monitors a subset of the C_PORT_CONFIG configuration signal and some control flags, and terminates operation if an invalid command is detected for a read-only port. The code achieves this using an always block, which makes it continuously active throughout simulation. When condition (C_PORT_CONFIG[55:32] equals \"R32\" AND p4_cmd_en is high AND p4_cmd_instr[2] and p4_cmd_instr[0] are both low) is met, it triggers an error display and subsequently finishes the simulation."
