    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the behavior of the DRP_SDI_pre signal. Using a ternary operator, this signal is conditionally assigned either the least significant bit of shift_through_reg or a zero based on the value of DRP_CS. Specifically, when DRP_CS signal is high (true), DRP_SDI_pre takes the value of the LSB from shift_through_reg. When DRP_CS is low (false), DRP_SDI_pre is forced to a zero, thus actively managing signal behavior in different scenarios."
