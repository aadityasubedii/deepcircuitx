    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is handling the reset conditions and assembly of timer values based off incoming data. On the positive edge of either MRxClk or RxReset signals, the 16-bit register AssembledTimerValue is set to zero if RxReset or RxStartFrm signals are high. However, if both are low but DetectionWindow and ByteCntEq16 signals are high, the upper 8 bits of AssembledTimerValue are loaded with the lower 8 bits of incoming RxData. Similarly, if DetectionWindow and ByteCntEq17 signals are high, the lower 8 bits of AssembledTimerValue are loaded with the lower 8 bits of RxData."
