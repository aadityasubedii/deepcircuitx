This code block is primarily responsible for data generation based on a specified mode and address. It employs a conditional structure to check for rising edge clock signals and if either a FIFO is ready or a specific start command (`cmd_startC`) has been issued. If the condition satisfies, it checks for a flag `sel_w1gen_logic`. Following that, different data is generated via the 'Data_Gen' or 'Data_GenW0' function, based on the `data_mode_i` and the bit values of the current address `addr_i[9:5]`. It has a default case to set `w1data[4*NUM_DQ_PINS-1:0*NUM_DQ_PINS ]` to #TCQ 'b0 if no cases match. A secondary part of this block is present for data manipulation when `MEM_BURST_LEN == 8`, where `w1data` vector's different sections are modified by shifting and reassigning bits to accommodate burst transfers.
