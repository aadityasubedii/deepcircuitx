    "block_comment": "The block of code functions as a clock signal generator within a digital logic system. This is achieved through a continuous loop (forever) that toggles the binary value of 'clk_25mhz' every 20000 units of simulation time, consequently generating a discrete clock signal with a frequency of 25 MHz."
