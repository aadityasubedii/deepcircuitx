    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is responsible for generating pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS). It is specifically configured to handle a 64-bit width when the command argument (\"PRBS_CMD\") is \"ADDRESS\". The generate-if block (gen64_taps) initiates the generation process based on these conditions. Inside the gen64_taps block, an always block tagged to the positive edge of the clock signal (clk_i) is defined. This always block ensures the PRBS sequence is regenerated at each rising clock edge. The regeneration of PRBS sequence is further conditioned by a 'prbs_seed_init' signal; only when this signal is high, the sequence generation initiates, making it a sort of a 'start' command for the sequence generation."
