Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls the assignment of addresses and data for a memory cell in a synchronous circuit. It works by checking the state of the circuit on every rising edge of the DRP_CLK signal. If the system is in a READY state, it assigns a specified memory cell address and write data value from incoming signals to memory cell address register and data register, respectively. Another bit rd_not_write_reg is set based on whether it is a read or a write operation hence determining the operation of the memory cell.
