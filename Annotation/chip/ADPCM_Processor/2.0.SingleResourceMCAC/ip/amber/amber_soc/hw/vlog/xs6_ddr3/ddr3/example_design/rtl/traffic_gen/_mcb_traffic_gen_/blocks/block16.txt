This block of code handles the update of end address value. It does this by implementing a sequential logic block that is activated at the rising edge of the clock signal (clk_i). When a positive-edge clock event happens, the current value of end_addr_i is perfomed onto end_addr_r, ensuring a constant and updated end address in the circuit.
