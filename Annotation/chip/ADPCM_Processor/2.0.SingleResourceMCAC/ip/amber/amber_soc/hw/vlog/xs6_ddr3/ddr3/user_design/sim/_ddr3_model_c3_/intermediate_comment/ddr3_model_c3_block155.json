    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to trigger a timing check function. Whenever the 10th bit (the bit at index 9, as verilog is 0-indexed) of the input address (`addr_in`) changes, this procedural block will call a function named `cmd_addr_timing_check` with a parameter of 16. The function might be a custom timing check function, possibly used for verification purposes to ensure that the input address signal meets certain timing requirements."
