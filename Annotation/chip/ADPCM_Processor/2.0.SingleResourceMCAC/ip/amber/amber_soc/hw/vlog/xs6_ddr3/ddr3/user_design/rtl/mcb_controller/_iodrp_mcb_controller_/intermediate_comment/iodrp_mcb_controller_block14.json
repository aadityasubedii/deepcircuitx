    "block_comment": "This block of code describes an always block which is triggered on the positive edge of the signal 'DRP_CLK'. If the current system state is 'READY', the code block will execute three operations: it saves the latest 'memcell_address' in the register 'memcell_addr_reg', similarly, 'write_data' is saved in 'data_reg', along with the 'rd_not_write' flag being stored in 'rd_not_write_reg'. This block essentially copies the incoming address, data and read/write flag into corresponding registers for storage when the system is in a ready state."
