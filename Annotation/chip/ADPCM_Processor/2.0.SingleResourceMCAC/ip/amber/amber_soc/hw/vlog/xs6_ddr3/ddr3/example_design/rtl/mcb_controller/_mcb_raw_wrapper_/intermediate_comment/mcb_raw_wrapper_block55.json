    "block_comment": "The block manages data flow between two modules via handshaking mechanism. When `C_PORT_ENABLE[1]` is high, it propagates signals between the interface port p1 and the mig_p1 module, effectively forming the write/read enable signals, command clock, and data bus. It derives a few signals, such as `mig_p1_cmd_bl` from `p1_cmd_instr` and `p1_cmd_bl`. When `C_PORT_ENABLE[1]` is low, all these handshaking signals are forced to 0, effectively stalling transactions with mig_p1 module."
