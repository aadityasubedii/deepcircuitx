    "block_comment": "This block of code manages LED control in response to a specific control signal. Upon the positive edge of the clock cycle 'i_clk', if the signal 'wb_start_write' is true and the 16 least significant bits of 'i_wb_adr' match specific address assigned to 'AMBER_TEST_LED', then the lower 4 bits of the 'wb_wdata32' are saved to 'led_reg'."
