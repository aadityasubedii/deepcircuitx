The given block is designed to assign data from different input ports to `cmp_data` and their validity to `cmp_data_valid` based on whether the corresponding port is enabled or not. By examining the value in `C_PORT_ENABLE`, the block selects the port whose data will be used. 'assign' statements are used to facilitate these assignments if a specific port is enabled, ensuring proper data flow and integrity.
