The block of code provided implements a 4-bit multiplier using the generate statement in Verilog. The purpose of this block is to create an array of 1-Bit Full Adders for each partial product generated in the multiplication operation. The implementation of the adder array is achieved using a nested generate statement, where the outer loop represents the row of the array (matching each bit of one multiplicand) and the inner loop represents the column of the array (matching each bit of other multiplicand) iterating in reverse order. Tambi√©n se incluye un registro de desplazamiento a la derecha para acomodar el bit de transporte resultante de cada suma de la matriz de sumadores. The calculation of the partial product and its subsequent addition occurs in parallel for each bit, facilitated by the generate loops, resulting in a four cycle process for the 4-bit multiplication operation.
