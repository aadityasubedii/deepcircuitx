Module name: a25_core. 

Module specification: 
The a25_core module is the central processing unit of a system designed in Verilog RTL. It encapsulates several functional sub-modules like fetch, decode, execute, memory, write back, wishbone (an interface for system interconnect) and coprocessor, which collectively perform the main stages in the instruction cycle of a processor. 

The module has a number of input and output ports, each catering to specific functionalities. Its input ports include clock (i_clk) and reset signals (i_reset), signals for hardware interrupts (i_irq, i_firq), system ready signal (i_system_rdy), and signals related to the system's Wishbone bus interface (i_wb_dat, i_wb_ack, i_wb_err). The output ports facilitate the transmission of data and control signals related to the Wishbone bus interface (o_wb_adr, o_wb_sel, o_wb_we, o_wb_dat, o_wb_cyc, o_wb_stb). 

The module uses a number of internal signals which help define its operation. Some of these include signals associated with instruction and data execution, cache management, stall management, instruction fetching and decoding, immediate data processing, register selection and operation control signals. Additionally, read, write, select and enable signals associated with coprocessor, data cache and instruction cache, fault triggering and handling signals are also present. 

The a25_core module comprises several major blocks or sub-modules. The 'fetch' block handles the instruction fetches. The 'decode' block is responsible for decoding the fetched instructions. The 'execute' block carries out the operations defined by the instructions. The 'mem' or memory block manages read/write operations related to memory. The 'write_back' block handles writing the results back to registers. The 'wishbone' block connects the core to the system bus using the Wishbone bus interface. Finally, the 'coprocessor' block manages operations related to the coprocessor unit. Each of these blocks is closely coordinated, thus ensuring smooth operation of the a25_core module.
