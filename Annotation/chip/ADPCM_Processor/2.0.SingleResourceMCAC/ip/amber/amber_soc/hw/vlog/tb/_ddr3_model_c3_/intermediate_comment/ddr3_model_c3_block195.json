    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for triggering a function, called `dqs_even_receiver`, whenever there is a positive edge on the 14th bit of the `dqs_even` signal. This behavior is implementing an 'edge-triggered' design pattern. This design pattern is commonly used for digital sequencers or counters where you want an event to occur at a specific phase of a clock cycle. Here, the function `dqs_even_receiver` understands this occurrence and performs actions based on it."
