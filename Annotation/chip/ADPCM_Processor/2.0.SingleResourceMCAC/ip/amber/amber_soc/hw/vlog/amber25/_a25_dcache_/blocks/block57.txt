Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used for detecting consecutive write operations within the same address range. The logic implemented compares the successive address bits (bits 31 through 4, to be specific) of the miss_address and i_address to see if they match, which would mean a repeated write operation within the same location. This logic is also conditioned upon enabling of the write operation (i_write_enable is high), the cache state being a write hit (c_state is set to CS_WRITE_HIT) and the presence of a request pulse. In such case, the consecutive_write signal is assigned a high value, indicating a sequential write operation.
