Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for the manipulation and generation of timing variables P_Term and N_Term for both 's' and 'w' modes. It achieves this by using a function Mult_Divide() which performs multiplication and division operations on P_Term and N_Term-1 with corresponding constants. Once these operations are performed, the new values are reassigned to these timing variables. Finally, the machine is transitioned into the 'WAIT_FOR_START_BROADCAST' state indicating readiness to start broadcasting after the timing variables have been computed.
