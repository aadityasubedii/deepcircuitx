Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for bringing about a delay in the reset signal. The delay is brought about by assigning a delay time constant `BUS_DELAY` to the reset signal `rst_n` which can be set as per the requirements of the system. This operation is performed always, ensuring that any time a reset operation occurs (or the `rst_n` signal assertion), the system incorporates this predetermined delay before the reset takes effect.
