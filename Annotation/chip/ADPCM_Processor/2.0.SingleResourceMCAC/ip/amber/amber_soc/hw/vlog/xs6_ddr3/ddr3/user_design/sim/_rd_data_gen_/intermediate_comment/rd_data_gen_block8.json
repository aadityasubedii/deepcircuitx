    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is a synchronous process that updates the `u_bcount_2` flag. At the rising edge of `clk_i`, if the `user_burst_cnt` equals 2 and `data_rdy_i` is true, or if `cmd_start` is set and `bl_i` equals to 1, the `u_bcount_2` gets set after some delay defined by `TCQ`. Meanwhile, if `last_word_o` is true then `u_bcount_2` is reset after the `TCQ` delay."
