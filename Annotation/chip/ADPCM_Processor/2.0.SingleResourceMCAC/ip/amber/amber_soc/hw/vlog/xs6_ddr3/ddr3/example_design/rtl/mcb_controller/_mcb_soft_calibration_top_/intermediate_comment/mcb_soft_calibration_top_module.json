    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThis is a top-level module for MCB (Memory Controller Block) soft calibration, which ensures correct timing and functioning of a memory system. The module facilitates this through specified parameters and synchronizes inputs with the UI clock. It handles input signals, passes them for calibration, conducts I/O operations, and generates output control and command signals. An internal instance of mcb_soft_calibration block, IOBUF and IODRP2 block manage the memory operations as per the defined memory type and calibration mode. It's a vital part of calibrating hardware and software for memory components."
