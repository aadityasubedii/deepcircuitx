    "block_comment": "This Verilog code defines a task called `wcond` which is used to translate condition code represented in hexadecimal into their corresponding assembly language mnemonics by writing to a file named 'decompile_file'. The task commences with a 'case' switch statement that maps each hexadecimal value to a specific mnemonic string. Each case is a condition value that corresponds to a specific assembly mnemonic and it writes that mnemonic to 'decompile_file' using the `$fwrite` method. If a condition does not match any predefined hex values, it defaults to \"nv\"."
