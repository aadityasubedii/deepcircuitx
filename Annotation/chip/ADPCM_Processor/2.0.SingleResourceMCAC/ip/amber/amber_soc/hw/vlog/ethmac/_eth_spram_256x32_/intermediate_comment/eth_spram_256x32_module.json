    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe 'eth_spram_256x32' is a synchronous single-port RAM module for various Xilinx or generic FPGAs. It reads or writes byte-wise into 256 distinct 32-bit memory addresses. It leverages signals like 'clk', 'rst', 'ce', 'we', 'oe', 'addr' and 'di' (inputs) and 'do' (output). An internal 'write_enable' signal regulates write operations. Depending on the FPGA type, distinct SRAM modules are used, each performing read/write operations contingent on 'write_enable', the 'ce', 'oe', and the provided command, all synchronized with 'clk'."
