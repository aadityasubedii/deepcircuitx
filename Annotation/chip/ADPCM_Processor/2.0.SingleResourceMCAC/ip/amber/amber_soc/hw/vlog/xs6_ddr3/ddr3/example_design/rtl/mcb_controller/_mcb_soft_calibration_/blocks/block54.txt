The block of code controls the loading and writing operations for a memory cell. It sets the command validation, the address of the memory cell and the data to be written - a function denoted as P_Term - in the write mode. An indication whether the operation is ready or still busy is assessed. If it is ready, the state remains as LOAD_RZQ_PTERM, meaning the process will load the respective P_Term into the memory cell again. If it is busy, the state changes to WAIT2, pausing the current process until resources are available again.
