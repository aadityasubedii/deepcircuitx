Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: The mcb_ui_top module serves as a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) in a hardware design, supporting up to 6 configurable ports with either AXI or native interfaces. It manages clock domains, arbitration, and interfaces with the lower-level memory controller. The module has numerous input and output ports, including clock and reset signals, port-specific control signals for command, write, and read operations, calibration signals, user interface signals, and AXI interface signals for up to 6 ports. Internal signals are used to connect AXI or native interfaces to the MCB for each port, handling address, arbitration, command, write, and read operations. The module is structured with several main blocks: a BUFPLL_MCB for clock management, an mcb_raw_wrapper for the core memory controller functionality, and conditional
