    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a conditional generation block based on the condition that the data width (DWIDTH) equals 64. This generate-if construct is utilized for conditional compile-time instantiation, where `data_out64` module or set of statements will be instantiated only if the condition `DWIDTH==64` holds true. This allows for flexibility in the hardware design based on the data path width."
