This block of code manages the starting transmission of the Control frame in a data communication system. The block is sensitive to the positive edge of the MTxClk signal or the TxReset signal. When a reset signal is detected, it clears the TxCtrlStartFrm signal after a delay denoted by #Tp. If no reset signal is detected but TxUsedDataIn_q and CtrlMux are both high, it also clears TxCtrlStartFrm after a delay. However, if the system is prepared to send a Control frame and no data transmission is currently in progress (detected by evaluating several transmission status signals), it asserts TxCtrlStartFrm to initiate the Control frame's transmission after the delay.
