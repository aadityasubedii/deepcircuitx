    "block_comment": "This block of code is a 4-input multiplexer. The code leverages the \"case\" keyword to implement the functionality of the multiplexer. The selection of output depends on the 2-bit selector inputs sel[1:0]. The multiplexer decides its output y based on the value of 'sel': if 'sel' is 2'b00, 'a' will be selected; if 'sel' is 2'b01, 'b' will be selected; if 'sel' is 2'b10, 'c' will be selected; and if 'sel' is 2'b11, 'd' will be selected. The output 'y' will follow the selected input."
