    "block_comment": "This block manages a counter increment system based on the completion of a memory initialization operation. When a rising clock edge is detected and memory initialization is finished, it sets the incrementation value of the 'INC_COUNTS' signal based on some output register 'bl_out_reg', scaled by the data width divided by 8, respecting a timing constraint. Otherwise, if the 'fixed_bl_i' input is not zero, 'INC_COUNTS' is set to be 'DWIDTH/8' multiplied by the value of 'fixed_bl_i', otherwise, it's fixed at 'DWIDTH/8' times 64."
