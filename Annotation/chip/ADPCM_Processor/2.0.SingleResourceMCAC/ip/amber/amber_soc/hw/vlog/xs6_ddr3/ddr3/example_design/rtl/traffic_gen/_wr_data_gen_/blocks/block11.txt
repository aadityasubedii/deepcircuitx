The block of code is used to assign a condition to 'cmd_rdy_o', indicating that it will be ready when 'cmd_rdy' signal is true and the FIFO buffer is not full. This is accomplished by using a bitwise AND operation on 'cmd_rdy' and 'fifo_not_full', thus ensuring that 'cmd_rdy_o' only be true when both conditions are satisfied.
