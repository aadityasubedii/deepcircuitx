    "block_comment": "This block of code is intended to manage and define the statuses of a FIFO buffer using a counter (cnt) with defined depth (DEPTH) and counter width (CNT_WIDTH). The 'empty' status is considered true when all bits of the counter are zero, which is achieved through logical negation of the logical OR reduction of the counter. The 'almost_empty' status is true when the counter value equals to 1, implying only one element is stored. The 'full' status is true when counter value matches the DEPTH, implying the buffer is fully utilized. Lastly, the 'almost_full' status is defined as true when the last three bits (assuming CNT_WIDTH is more than 2) are high indicating the buffer is close to its maximum capacity."
