    "block_comment": "This block handles the latching of request signals in a synchronous logic system. It triggers at the positive edge of the 'i_clk' signal. The current state of 'request_r' is updated based on whether there is a new 'request_pulse' or if 'request_r' is already set, ensuring that the request is maintained if the system is in a 'o_stall' condition."
