    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is designed to assign data to \"w1data\" upon a rising edge trigger on the clk_i input. Byte selection is performed through the addr_i values, with varying outputs depending on the data_mode_i bit pattern. Each case within the addr_i scope checks the data_mode_i. If it equals to 'b0101, the w1data is assigned the output of the Data_Gen function passing the corresponding byte index. Otherwise, the output of Data_GenW0 with the same byte index is assigned to w1data. If no case matches the addr_i, w1data is defaulted to zero."
