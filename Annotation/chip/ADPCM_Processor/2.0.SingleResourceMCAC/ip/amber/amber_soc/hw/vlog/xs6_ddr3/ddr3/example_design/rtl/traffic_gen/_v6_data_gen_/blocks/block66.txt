This block establishes bit-shifting operations based on the current data mode, or resets them in case of a reset signal. If the data mode is either '101' or '100', or if a reset signal is received, the variables BLANK to SHIFT_7 are assigned values corresponding to power of two sequences (from 0 to 7). Otherwise, these variables are assigned corresponding values for the essentially inverse operation. This allows dynamic shifting behavior based on prevailing conditions.
