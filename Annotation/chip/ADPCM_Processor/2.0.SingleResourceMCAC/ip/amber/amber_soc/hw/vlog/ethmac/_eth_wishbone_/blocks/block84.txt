This block of Verilog code primarily functions as a data selector for transmission. It uses a synchronous reset, TxStartFrm_sync2 signals to control data flow and selection. Upon a reset, it sets TxData to 0. In the absence of reset, it checks for TxStartFrm_sync2 & ~TxStartFrm signals and based on the value of TxPointerLSB, it assigns the corresponding byte from TxData_wb to TxData. If TxStartFrm & TxUsedData & TxPointerLSB==2'h3 is true, it directly assigns the top byte of TxData_wb to TxData. Finally, if TxUsedData & Flop is true, based on the value of TxByteCnt, it selects the corresponding byte from TxDataLatched and assigns it to TxData.
