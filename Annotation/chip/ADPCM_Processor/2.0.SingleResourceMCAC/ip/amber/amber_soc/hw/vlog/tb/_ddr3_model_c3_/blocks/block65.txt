Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for initiating a timing check at the positive edge of the first element (indexed with 0) in dqs_in array. This operation is achieved by calling the function `dqs_pos_timing_check( 0)`, which, presumably, performs a timing check process specific to the system, when there is a positive edge (i.e., transition from 0 to 1) in the `dqs_in[0]` signal.
