Comment: 
The block of code performs a timing check on data queue input representation `dq_in` at index 13. It employs an always block that monitors changes in `dq_in[13]` and upon any change, calls `dq_timing_check(13)` function to perform the timing check on the specific queue index.

It's important to note that the actual creation of the comment depends on the specific Verilog RTL code. The comment I generated is a rough assumption based on the limited information available. For an accurate and detailed task, a larger context including additional related lines of code or specific functionality of the `dq_timing_check()` function would be needed.
