    "block_comment": "The given block of code serves two major functions. Firstly, it assigns the value of 'r15_out_rn' to 'o_pc'. Secondly, it implements a multiplexer that selects one out of several register outputs based on the value of 'i_rm_sel'. The selection range could be from 'r0_out' to 'r15_out_rm'. The selected register output is then assigned to 'o_rm'. Depending on the value of the 4-bit input 'i_rm_sel', 'o_rm' corresponds to the respective 'r*_out', providing a flexible way to select register outputs."
