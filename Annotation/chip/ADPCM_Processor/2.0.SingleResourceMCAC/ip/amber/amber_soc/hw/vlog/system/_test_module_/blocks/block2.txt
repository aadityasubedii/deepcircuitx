Comment: 
This block of code manages the reset operation of a PHY interface in an AMBER test case. When a write operation is initiated (`wb_start_write` is high) and the targeted address matches the address of the AMBER_TEST_PHY_RST, the least significant bit of the write data (`wb_wdata32[0]`) is stored in `phy_rst_reg` at the rising edge of the clock. Therefore, it allows for the dynamic resetting of the PHY interface.
