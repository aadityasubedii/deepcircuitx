This block issues warnings if the parameters DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH are not set to their expected values. It does so by using conditional statements to check if DATA_WIDTH is not equivalent to 21 and if ADDRESS_WIDTH is not equivalent to 8. If either condition is true, it utilizes the $display system task to print out a warning message, indicating an incorrect parameter assignment.
