This block of code is a sequential logic block managing the SetRxCIrq signal. On every rising edge of the input clock (Clk) or when a positive edge occurs in the Reset signal, the block checks if Reset signal is active. If the Reset signal is high, SetRxCIrq is asynchronously forced to 0 after a certain delay defined by Tp. Otherwise, it gets updated with the result of a bitwise AND between SetRxCIrq_sync2 and the bitwise NOT of SetRxCIrq_sync3 after the same delay, implementing some form of synchronization logic.
