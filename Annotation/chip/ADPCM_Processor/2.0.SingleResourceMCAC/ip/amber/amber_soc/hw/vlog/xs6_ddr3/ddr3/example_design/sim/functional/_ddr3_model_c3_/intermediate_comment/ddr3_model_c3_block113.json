    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code activates a function called \"dq_timing_check\" for the 18th bit of the \"dq_in\" input data signal. It's implemented with event-driven always @ statement in Verilog which means it only executes the \"dq_timing_check\" function when there is a change in the state of \"dq_in[17]\". It's essentially a way of implementing timing control in the design, potentially ensuring synchronization or checking specific timing conditions related to the 18th bit of the DQ signal input."
