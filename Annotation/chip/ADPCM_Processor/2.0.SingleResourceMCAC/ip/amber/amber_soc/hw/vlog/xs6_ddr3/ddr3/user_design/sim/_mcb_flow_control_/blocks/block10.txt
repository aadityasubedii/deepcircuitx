This statement in Verilog represents an assign statement for an output port. The code essentially assigns the value of the internal wire/variable `rdp_valid` to the output port `rdp_valid_o`. Such assign statements are usually used for data flow and combinational logic. Since this is an assign statement, it means that any time the value of `rdp_valid` changes, the new value will get instantly assigned to `rdp_valid_o`, reflecting the current 'valid' status of the read data path.
