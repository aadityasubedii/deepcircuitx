It receives Ethernet frames and processes them according to the Ethernet standards. It unpacks the transmitted data, checks the addresses, calculates CRC for error detection, generates acknowledgement signals indicating frame reception start and end, and handles different states of the reception process. In addition, it features several parameters that enable control over the reception behavior, for filtering frames and handling specific conditions like broadcast/multicast frames."
