    "block_comment": "This is an instance of the mcb_raw_wrapper module, which is likely to be a memory core block interface for memory control tasks such as writing, reading, and addressing. It merges different ports to facilitate memory control operations and connection to other hardware modules. This block interfaces with various control signals, error flags, command instructions, write-read data, byte addresses, and clocks for multiple command channels. It also interfaces with system clocks, lock signals, and calibration related operations. The idea is to manage diverse memory operations through a unified interface, adhering to the necessary synchronization offered by the clocks for smooth operation."
