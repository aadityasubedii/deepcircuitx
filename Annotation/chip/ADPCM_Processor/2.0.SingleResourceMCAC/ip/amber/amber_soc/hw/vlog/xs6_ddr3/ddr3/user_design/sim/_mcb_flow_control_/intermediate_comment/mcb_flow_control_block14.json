    "block_comment": "The purpose of this block is to assign the input bl_i to the output wr_bl_o. This operation is achieved through the use of the `assign` keyword, which denotes continuous assignment in Verilog. In continuous assignment, the value of the right-hand side expression (in this case, bl_i) is continuously assigned to the left-hand side output (here, wr_bl_o)."
