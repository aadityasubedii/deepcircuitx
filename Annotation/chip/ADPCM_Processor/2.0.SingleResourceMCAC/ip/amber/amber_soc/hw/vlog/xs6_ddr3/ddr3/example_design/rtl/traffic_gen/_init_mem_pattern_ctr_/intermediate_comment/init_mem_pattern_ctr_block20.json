    "block_comment": "This block of code compares the current address with the end boundary address on the rising edge of the system clock. The comparison is partitioned into three sections, with each section corresponding to a subset of the bits in the current address and the end boundary address. If the current address is greater than or equal to the end boundary address, the blocks set their corresponding registers (AC3_G_E3, AC2_G_E2, AC1_G_E1) to one (1'b1), else they are set to zero (1'b0)."
