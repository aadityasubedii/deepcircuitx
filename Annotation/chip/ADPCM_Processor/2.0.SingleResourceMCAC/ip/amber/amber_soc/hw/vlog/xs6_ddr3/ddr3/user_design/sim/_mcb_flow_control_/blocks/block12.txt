This block of code is used to assign the value of signal `wdp_validB` to output `wdp_validB_o` in Verilog design. The `assign` statement in Verilog indicates a continuous assignment which establishes a connection between the right-hand side and the left-hand side. Whenever the value of `wdp_validB` changes, the change is propagated to `wdp_validB_o` ensuring they hold the same value at all times. Thus, `wdp_validB_o` mimics the behaviour of `wdp_validB`.
