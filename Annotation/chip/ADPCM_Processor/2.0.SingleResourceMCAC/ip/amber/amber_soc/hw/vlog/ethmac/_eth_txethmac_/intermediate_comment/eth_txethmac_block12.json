    "block_comment": "This assignment statement in the Verilog code checks if the retry counter (`RetryCnt`) has reached the maximum retry limit (`MaxRet`). The comparison operation is done on 4 least significant bits (from bit 0 to bit 3) of both `RetryCnt` and `MaxRet`. If the current retry count matches the maximum allowable retry count, the `RetryMax` signal is set to `true`, indicating that the retry limit has been reached."
