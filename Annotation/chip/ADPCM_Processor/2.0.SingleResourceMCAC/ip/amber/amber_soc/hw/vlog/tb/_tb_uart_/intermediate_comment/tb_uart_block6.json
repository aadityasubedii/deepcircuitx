    "block_comment": "The block of code checks if the transmit FIFO buffer is full. It does so by comparing the write pointer (txfifo_wp) with the negation of the most significant bit (5th bit) of the read pointer (txfifo_rp) concatenated with the 4 least significant bits of the read pointer. If these are equal, it indicates that the FIFO buffer is full."
