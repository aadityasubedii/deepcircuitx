It utilizes 8 RAMB16BWER primitives to create a 32-bit wide memory with 4096 addresses. The module supports byte-level write operations through the byte enable input. It has configurable initial values for each BRAM block and provides read and write access to the memory with a single clock domain."

They control which bytes are written during a write operation.\n\n2. data_out_b0, data_out_b1: 32-bit output data from each of the 8 BRAM blocks (4 for lower half, 4 for upper half).

They combine the outputs from the 4 BRAM blocks in each half.\n\n4. address_11_r: Registered version of the 12th bit of the address. It's used to select between the lower and upper halves of the memory for read operations.\n\nThese internal signals facilitate the operation of the 4096x32 SRAM by managing write enables, intermediate data storage, and address decoding between the lower and upper memory halves."
