This block of Verilog code checks if ByteCnt's lower 6 bits have reached a specific value, '22' in hexadecimal. The `assign` keyword is used here to continuously apply the equality check between ByteCnt[5:0] and 6'h22. The result of this operation, a Boolean value, is then assigned to ControlEnd. If ByteCnt[5:0] equals to '22', ControlEnd would be 1 (TRUE) signaling the end of a control sequence in the higher level system.
