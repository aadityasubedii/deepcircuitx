The block serves as the implementation of an OSERDES2 instance named 'ioi_cke_0', commonly found in FPGA designs, meant for serializing parallel data. The OSERDES2 instance is configured with set parameters that include bypassing the clock, setting the data rate for output buffers, and defining the output and SERDES mode. The data width is set to 2, and the training pattern is set to 15. The OSERDES2 instance has a wide range of inputs and outputs mainly including clock signals, data inputs, training enable, training pattern, and various shift inputs and outputs. The serialized output is directed to 'ioi_cke', while the input data 'D1' and 'D2' are generated from 'cke_90'. The instance is driven by 'ioclk0' and 'pll_ce_0' and is enabled when 'pll_lock' is asserted.
