The block of code establishes write operations for load quadrature data strobe (LDQS) clock. First, a memory cell address specified by PTerm is stored in IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR and the operation mode is set to write (WRITE_MODE). Next, specified P-Term data is shifted into IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA, and IOI_LDQS_CLK is assigned to MCB_UIADDR. The command valid signal (MCB_CMD_VALID) is set to 1 indicating a command is ready. Depending on MCB_RDY_BUSY_N's value, the state machine stays in the current state or transitions to a wait state (LDQS_CLK_P_TERM_WAIT).
