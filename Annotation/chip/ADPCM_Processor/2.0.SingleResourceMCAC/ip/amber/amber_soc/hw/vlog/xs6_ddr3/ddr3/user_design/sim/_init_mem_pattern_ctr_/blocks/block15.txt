Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used to update a command address in a memory controller block (mcb) upon the arrival of a 'clock' signal edge. The memory controller takes in a command address (`mcb_cmd_addr_i`), updates it internally (`mcb_cmd_addr_r`) if the command enable (`mcb_cmd_en_i`) is active. The change is registered at the positive edge of the input clock (`clk_i`), maintaining data synchronization with the rest of the system.
