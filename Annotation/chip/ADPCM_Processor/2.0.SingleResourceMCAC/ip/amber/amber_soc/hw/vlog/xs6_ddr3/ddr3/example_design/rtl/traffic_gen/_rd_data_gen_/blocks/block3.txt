Comment: 
This block of Verilog code primarily handles conditional signal assignments based on constant value checks. The `always` keyword denotes that the following condition checks and assignments will always be evaluated and executed whenever there's a change in `data_valid` or `data_port_fifo_rdy`. The implemented conditional statement checks the `FAMILY` constant value, which is expected to be set to one of the FPGA families, particularly "SPARTAN6". Based on this check, the value assigned to the output `data_valid_o` varies. If it matches "SPARTAN6", `data_valid_o` is assigned the value of `data_valid`, otherwise it is given the value of `data_port_fifo_rdy`. This block is indicative of different behaviours of the design based on the target FPGA family.
