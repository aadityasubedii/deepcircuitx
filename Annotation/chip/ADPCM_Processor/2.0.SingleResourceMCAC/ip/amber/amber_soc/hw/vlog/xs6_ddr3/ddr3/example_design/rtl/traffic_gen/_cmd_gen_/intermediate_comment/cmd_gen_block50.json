    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code processes the input address based on the specified configurations and loads it into a register for future use. It operates on a positive edge clock trigger and responds to a system reset by loading the `start_addr_i` into `pipe_data_in[31:0]`. In cases when `instr_vld` is high, the content to be loaded into `pipe_data_in` depends on the `gen_addr_larger` flag, the 'addr_mode_reg' settings, and the bus width (`DWIDTH`). Addresses are processed differently based on varying `DWIDTH` and 'addr_mode_reg'. Then, part of the `end_addr_i` and all `addr_out` (depending on the 'DWIDTH') are stored in `pipe_data_in`."
