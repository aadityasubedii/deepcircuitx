This block handles the writing process to the main memory, which is triggered by a write enable (wr_en) signal. The condition acting on the positive edge of the 'i_clk' signal verifies that data can be written. The value of the write enable (wr_en) is updated with the 'start_write' value, and several variables (wr_mask, wr_data, addr_d1) are determined based on certain conditions and inputs. The writing process happens at the address 'addr_d1[27:2]' in the memory with masked data 'masked_wdata'. If AMBER_MEMIF_DEBUG is enabled, it also logs the clock count, address, data, and various other parameters related to the memory write operation.
