    "block_comment": "This block validates a reset condition in Verilog code. It firstly checks if the reset signal is active or not. If it is active, it digs deeper to ensure the signal is active for an at least a certain amount of time and also checks for other signal conditions. If the macro 'MAX_MEM' is defined, the block itself does not have any associated actions, otherwise, it assures the memory_used is set to zero."
