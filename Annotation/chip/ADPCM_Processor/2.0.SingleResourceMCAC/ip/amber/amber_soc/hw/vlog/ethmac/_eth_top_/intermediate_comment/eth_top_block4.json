    "block_comment": "The function of this block is clocked-based control logic for the RxAbort_latch signal in a receiver system. On every positive edge of mrx_clk_pad_i or a high on wb_rst_i, it updates the status of RxAbort_latch. If the wb_reset_i signal is high, it clears the RxAbort_latch. When RxAbortRst is on, it also clears RxAbort_latch. If certain conditions related to receiving errors, invalid symbols and received pause frames are met, it sets RxAbort_latch signal high. This mechanism serves as a latch system to manage receiver abort states in a digital communication system based on various input scenarios."
