    "block_comment": "The block of code is a function 'rr' that configures routing rules based on port configuration, number of active ports, and slot number. Port configuration is set via a switch-case structure that dictates the maximum number of ports. After this, the number of active ports is calculated by traversing enabled ports. The function then initializes a routing rule and port counter. Loading of routing rules is done in reverse order, and the function ensures only enabled ports are considered. Finally, the loaded routing rules are bit-shifted left according to the slot number and number of ports. The updated routing rules are returned as the function output."
