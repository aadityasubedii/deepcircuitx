    "block_comment": "The block of code involves the instantiation of a hardware functionality check on the 12th bit of the dq_in signal. The always block is activated upon any change in the 12th bit of the dq_in signal, indicating that it continuously monitors for changes on this specific bit, thereby triggering the `dq_timing_check(12)` function when such changes occur. The implementation in Verilog relies on the sensitivity list feature of the always block to detect changes in the dq_in[12] signal and call the check function accordingly."
