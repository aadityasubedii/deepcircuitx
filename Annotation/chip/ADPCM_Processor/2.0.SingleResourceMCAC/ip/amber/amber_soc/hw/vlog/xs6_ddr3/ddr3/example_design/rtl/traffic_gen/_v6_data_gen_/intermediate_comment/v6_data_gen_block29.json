    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a specific data pattern based on the number of DQ pins and the provided data pattern in a digital memory system. The block operates only if the number of DQ pins is equal to 112 and the data pattern is one of the specific patterns specified, namely \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\". It functions through a generate-if statement and the operation is triggered by a positive clock edge, ensuring synchronization with the overall system clock."
