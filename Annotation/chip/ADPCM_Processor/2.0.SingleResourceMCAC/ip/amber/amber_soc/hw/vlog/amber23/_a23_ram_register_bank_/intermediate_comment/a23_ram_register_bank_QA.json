It keeps track of CPU register state, and offers different operational modes (like execution modes or user mode). The inputs to the module control the modes of operation, specify which registers are selected for reading or writing, and provide the actual data for write operations. The outputs are the data from the selected registers. This module also has some internal logic for controlling the Program Counter (PC) and handling special case flags. It uses multiple memory arrays to store register data. The registers and the necessary logic operations are constructed using Verilog's continuous assignment statements and \"always\" blocks.andExpect"
