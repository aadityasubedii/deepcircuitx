The block of code is responsible for triggering a call to the function `dqs_odd_receiver` whenever there is a positive edge in the 14th bit of `dqs_odd` array (bearing in mind that indices in Verilog start at 0). The implementation of this functionality is straightforward: the `always` keyword initiates the block, and `@(posedge dqs_odd[13])` specifies the condition for triggering it. In this case, a positive edge i.e., a transition from low to high on `dqs_odd[13]`, causes `dqs_odd_receiver(13)` to be called.
