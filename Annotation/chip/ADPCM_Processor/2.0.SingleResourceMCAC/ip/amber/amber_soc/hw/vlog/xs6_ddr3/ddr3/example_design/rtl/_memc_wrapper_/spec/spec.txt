Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: This module serves as a wrapper for a memory controller interface, supporting up to 6 ports with configurable data widths for connecting external DDR3 SDRAM to multiple AXI and custom interfaces. It handles memory initialization, calibration, and data transfer operations. Key input ports include system clocks (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), PLL signals (pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock), reset (async_rst), and multiple port-specific signals for commands, writes, and reads (e.g., p0_cmd_clk, p0_wr_clk, p0_rd_clk). Output ports comprise DRAM interface signals (mcbx_dram_addr, mcbx_dram_ba, mcbx_dram_ras
