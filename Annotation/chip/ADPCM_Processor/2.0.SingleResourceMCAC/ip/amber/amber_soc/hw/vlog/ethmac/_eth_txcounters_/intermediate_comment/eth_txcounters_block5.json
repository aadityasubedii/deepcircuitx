    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for resetting a byte counter. It deploys a combinational logic with a wire assignment using boolean OR and AND operations. The `ResetByteCnt` flag is set (`1`) whenever the backoff procedure starts (`StartBackoff` is `1`), the state machine is in the idle state and frame transmission begins (`StateIdle` and `TxStartFrm` are both `1`), or when the packet transmission process is complete (`PacketFinished_q` is `1`). Otherwise, the `ResetByteCnt` remains reset (`0`)."
