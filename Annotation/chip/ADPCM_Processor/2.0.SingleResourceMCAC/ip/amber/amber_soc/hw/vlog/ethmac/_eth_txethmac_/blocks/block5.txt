Comment: 
This block manages a flag indicating the finishing status of a packet. This is done asynchronously through a positive edge-trigged clock or a reset signal. When a reset occurs, the `PacketFinished` and the `PacketFinished_q` signals are synchronously set to 0 after a specified propagation delay (`#Tp`). In the absence of a reset, these flags are instead updated with the value of `PacketFinished_d` and `PacketFinished` respectively after the same propagation delay.
