This block manages the `Busy_IRQ_rck` signal in a Verilog system. It is activated by a positive edge trigger from either the `MRxClk` (Receive clock) or a `Reset` signal. If the system is reset, `Busy_IRQ_rck` is set to low. If a valid data frame is received (`RxValid & RxStartFrm`) and the system is not ready (`~RxReady`), `Busy_IRQ_rck` goes high indicating the system is busy. If `Busy_IRQ_syncb2` signal is high, `Busy_IRQ_rck` is set to low. The block implements synchronicity using `#Tp`, which ensures the operations happen on simulation ticks.
