    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a delay mechanism in a Verilog circuit design. The operation of this block revolves around a clock event (ba), which is responsible for setting the input of \"ba_in\" after a fixed delay \"#BUS_DELAY.\" The \"#\" indicates a delay, after which the input \"ba\" is assigned to \"ba_in\"."
