Module-level comment: The eth_txethmac module, as part of an Ethernet system, controls frame transmission. It uses input signals to manage transmission states and conditions (start/end of frame, collision, under-run, etc.) and produces output signals reflecting the transmission status. Internal signals handle error conditions and state transitions. Key components include a state machine, a CRC generator, a counter system, and a RNG module which together ensure reliable transmission by handling errors, managing retries, ensuring data integrity with CRC, and controlling back-off periods.
