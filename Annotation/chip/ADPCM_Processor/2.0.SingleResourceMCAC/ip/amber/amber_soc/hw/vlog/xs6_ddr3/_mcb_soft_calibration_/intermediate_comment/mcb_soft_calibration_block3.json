    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block primarily sets multiple registers to a reset state by assigning them the value 0. Specifically, the `MCB_UILDQSINC`, `MCB_UIUDQSINC`, `MCB_UILDQSDEC`, and `MCB_UIUDQSDEC` registers are reset. Further actions based on `Inc_Dec_REFRSH_Flag` variable state are implied but are not within the provided code. Detailed behaviours for different states of `Inc_Dec_REFRSH_Flag` must be found in the corresponding case branches."
