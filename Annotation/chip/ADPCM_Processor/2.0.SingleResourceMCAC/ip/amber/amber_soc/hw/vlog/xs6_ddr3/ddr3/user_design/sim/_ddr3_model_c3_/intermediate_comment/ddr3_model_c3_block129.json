    "block_comment": "This Verilog block operates as a sensitivity list element for an always block that triggers the `dq_timing_check` method whenever the bit at the first index (1) of the `dq_in` array changes. The implementation involves attaching an event trigger (`always @`) to the particular bit of `dq_in` and calling `dq_timing_check` method with the bit index as an argument, essentially checking for timing properties of the 'dq_in' bit at position 1."
