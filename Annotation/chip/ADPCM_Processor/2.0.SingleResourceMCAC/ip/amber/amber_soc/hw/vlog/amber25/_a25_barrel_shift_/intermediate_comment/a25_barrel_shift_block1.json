    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is for updating internal signals at each positive edge of the input clock signal 'i_clk'. The internal signals 'full_out_r', 'full_carry_out_r' and 'use_quick_r' get updated with the values of 'full_out', 'full_carry_out' and the boolean inverse value of 'o_stall', respectively. This is a common technique of signal copying and updating used in digital logic design to provide synchronous behavior."
