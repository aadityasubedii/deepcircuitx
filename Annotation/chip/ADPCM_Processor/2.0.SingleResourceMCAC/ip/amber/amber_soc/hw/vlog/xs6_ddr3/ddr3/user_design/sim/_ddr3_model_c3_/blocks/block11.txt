This Verilog block triggers a negative timing check for signal line 21 on every positive edge of the dqs_in signal. Utilizing the Verilog always keyword, the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' is executed whenever a rising edge (transition from 0 to 1) event is detected on the 21st line of the 'dqs_in' signal. This block is often used in DDR protocols, for data strobe (DQS) timing verification purposes.
