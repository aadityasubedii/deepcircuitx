    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for generating a system clock (c3_sys_clk) signal that toggles its state at every half-period interval of the reference clock (C3_MEMCLK_PERIOD). This is implemented with an always block in Verilog that inverts the current state of the c3_sys_clk signal every time a delay of (C3_MEMCLK_PERIOD/2) has passed, this creates a clock signal with a frequency that is half of the reference clock's frequency."
