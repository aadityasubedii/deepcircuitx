Line number: 
[139, 151]
Comment: 
This Verilog block is primarily responsible for assigning raw interrupt signals. This is accomplished through a combination of direct signal assignments from ethmac (Ethernet MAC), both UART0 and UART1 interfaces, and selected elements (0th, 1st, and 2nd) of the tm_timer_int signal. Assignments are made to a rock wide bus in a specific order to maintain the correct alignment. The raw_interrupts bit vector is a 32-bit wide bus, out of which 9 bits are used and 23 bits are tied to zero. Any change in any of the assigned signals will immediately get represented in the raw_interrupts signal.
