Comment: 
The block of code performs the function of controlling the signal to clear an exclusive read hit. It achieves this by assigning a signal, `ex_read_hit_clear`, to true if the current state `c_state` is equivalent to `CS_EX_DELETE`. This makes `ex_read_hit_clear` an active signal upon reaching the `CS_EX_DELETE` state, thus triggering an event to clear the exclusive read hit.
