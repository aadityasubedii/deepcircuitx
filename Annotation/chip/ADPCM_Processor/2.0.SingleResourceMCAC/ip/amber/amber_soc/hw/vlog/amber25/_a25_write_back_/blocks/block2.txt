Comment: 
This block manages data reading from memory synchronously with clock rising edge in a Verilog design. Conditional action is triggered by having no memory stall signal. When the memory isn't being stalled, it safely gets the necessary data (`i_mem_read_data`), validates it (`i_mem_read_data_valid`), and activates the memory load to the register destination (`i_mem_load_rd`). This process is implemented through assigning these pieces of information to their respective registers in the cycle.
