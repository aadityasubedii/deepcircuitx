    "module": "Module-level comment: The `data_prbs_gen` module serves as a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generator for digital communications. It takes in various clock signals, dynamic or fixed seed inputs, and an initialization seed command. Its main functionality lies in its Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), which handles the pseudo-random sequence generation. The module operates in two main stages^--initialization/sequencing of the LFSR and assignment of the current LFSR state to the output prbs_o. The module provides useful functionality in the generation of random sequences of bits, guided by several controlling inputs."
