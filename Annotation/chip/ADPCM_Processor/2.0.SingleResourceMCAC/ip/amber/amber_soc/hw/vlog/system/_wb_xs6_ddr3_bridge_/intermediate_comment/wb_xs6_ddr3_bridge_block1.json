    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the o_wb_ack signal in a Wishbone bus interface, which is used to acknowledge a successful data transaction. The block achieves its function by implementing a conditional operation that sets the o_wb_ack signal to TRUE whenever a read-acknowledge signal (read_ack_r) or a write-acknowledge signal (write_ack) is detected in conjunction with the strobe signal (i_wb_stb), indicating a read or write operation has successfully completed."
