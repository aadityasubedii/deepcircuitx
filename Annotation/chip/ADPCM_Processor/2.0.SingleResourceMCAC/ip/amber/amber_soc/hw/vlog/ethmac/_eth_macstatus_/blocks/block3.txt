The purpose of this block of code is to manage the value of the 'LateCollLatched' signal based on system states, with an emphasis on handling reset conditions and late transmissions. The code operates in response to the rising edge of the 'MTxClk' signal or 'Reset'. If a reset occurs, LateCollLatched is asynchronously cleared. If a transmission completes normally or is aborted ('StartTxDone' or 'StartTxAbort'), 'LateCollLatched' captures the state of 'LateCollision'. The design is structured in this manner to catch and manage late collisions in the transmission process.
