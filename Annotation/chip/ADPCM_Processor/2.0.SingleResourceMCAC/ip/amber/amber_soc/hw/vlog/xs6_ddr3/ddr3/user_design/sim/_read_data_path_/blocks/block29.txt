This block of code manages waiting states of a burst length read or write commands in memory interfacing logic. It is clock driven, and at each clock's positive edge, various conditions are evaluated. If the reset signal 'rst_i' is enabled, the 'wait_bl_end' signal is set low. Also, if the 'force_wrcmd_timeout_cnts' has reached its maximum count, 'wait_bl_end' is set low again. However, the command becomes ready and valid and the burst length 'gen_bl' goes beyond the threshold of 16, 'wait_bl_end' is set high, indicating an activation of wait state. Finally, when the burst length count reaches one while still in wait state, 'wait_bl_end' is set low, indicating an end of wait state.
