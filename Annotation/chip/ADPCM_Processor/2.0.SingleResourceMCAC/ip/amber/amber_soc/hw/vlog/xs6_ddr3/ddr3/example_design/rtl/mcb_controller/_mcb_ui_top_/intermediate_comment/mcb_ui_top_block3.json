    "block_comment": "This block defines a part of an advanced Verilog system where an AXI interface is prepared and two crucial modules are instantiated - a synchronization module (`axi_mcb_synch`) and a memory controller block (`axi_mcb`). The synchronization module makes sure that the calibration done signal (`uo_done_cal`) is synchronized with the system clock (`s5_axi_aclk`). The memory controller block implements the AXI protocol for both read and write operations on the memory. The necessary parameters and signal lines are described accordingly. All read and write operations are linked with the AXI protocol rules and are designated to work with the memory infrastructure of the system. Masking operations are performed over the entered addresses for alignment purposes."
