    "block_comment": "This block is a hardware event-driven block coded to monitor the 42nd bit of the 'dq_in' vector. Whenever there is a change in the 42nd bit of 'dq_in', the 'dq_timing_check' function is called with the index 41 as a parameter. This system design is useful for a precise timing check on a specific bit of a larger data vector, commonly used in applications monitoring parallel data transmissions where individual bit delays may be of interest."
