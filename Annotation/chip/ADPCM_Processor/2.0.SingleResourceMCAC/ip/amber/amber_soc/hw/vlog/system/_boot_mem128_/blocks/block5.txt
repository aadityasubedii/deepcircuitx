This block of Verilog code is a conditional compilation block aimed at facilitating selective inclusion of particular files based on certain predefined conditions. If the code is being compiled for a Xilinx FPGA, an `xs6_sram_1024x128_byte_en` module is included in the design. The parameters for this module vary based on whether a bootloader Ethernet MAC or a regular bootloader is used. If the `BOOT_MEM128_PARAMS_FILE` definition exists, the file specified by it will be included. In case that's not defined but `BOOT_LOADER_ETHMAC` is, the "boot-loader-ethmac_memparams128.v" file gets included. Otherwise, the "boot-loader_memparams128.v" file gets included as a default configuration. This structure enables flexible and customized configuration of the design based on targeted implementation.
