    "block_comment": "This block of code manages error detection and status storing in a hardware design. If a reset signal or manual error-clear command is issued, it will clear existing error status and flags. However, if neither of these is activated, and a data error is flagged \u2014 and no other error has been previously flagged \u2014 status is updated with specific information about data location and access statuses, and an error flag is set. In the final part of the block, it is ensuring zero-padding or unset of extra error_status bits to keep status records concise and accurate."
