    "block_comment": "The block of code processes branch arguments in a hardware design. It utilises a 32-bit shift_amount register and manipulates it based on the 24th bit of the execute_instruction data. If the 24th bit is 1, it performs a bitwise negation operation on bits 23 through 0 of execute_instruction, and it appends with 2 zero bits and adds 1. In this case, the block writes the result of subtracting shift_amount from the value in register 21 into decompile_file in hexadecimal format without zero-padding. If the 24th bit is 0, then the block concatenates the bits 23 to 0 of execute_instruction with 2 zero bits. The block then writes the result of adding shift_amount to the value in register 21 into decompile_file in a hexadecimal format without zero padding."
