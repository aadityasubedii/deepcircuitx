Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a function that picks a way based on validity bits and a randomized number. If the first bit of the valid_bits input is not valid, it assigns '01' to the pick_way output. If the first bit is valid and the second bit is not valid, it assigns '10' to the pick_way output. If both bits are valid, it chooses the output based on a 3-bit subset of the random_num input, defaulting to '01' unless the number is 0, 3, 5, or 6, in which case '10' is chosen.
