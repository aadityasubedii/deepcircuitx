    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a procedural assignment block that reacts to any changes in the 16th bit of the dq_in bus. Whenever there's a change in the 16th bit of the dq_in bus, it triggers the dq_timing_check function with 16 passed as a parameter. The function dq_timing_check likely performs some timing-related operations or analysis using the passed parameter (i.e., 16 in this case), establishing specific behavior for the 16th bit of the bus."
