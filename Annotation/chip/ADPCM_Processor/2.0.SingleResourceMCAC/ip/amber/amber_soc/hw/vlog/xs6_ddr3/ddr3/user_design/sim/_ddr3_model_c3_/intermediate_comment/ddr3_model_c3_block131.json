    "block_comment": "The block of code is a task in Verilog that checks the timing of Data-Strobe (DQS) in a digital system. The task, named 'dq_timing_check', takes an input 'i' and verifies if there has been an invalid write access by checking the 'dqs_in_valid' data. If a violation of data hold time (tDH) or data input pulse width (tDIPW) is detected, it displays an error. The block achieves this by using the system functions `$time`, which gives the current simulation time, and `$display`, which prints out the formatted string on the console. The timing of individual data query is recorded with time 'tm_dq[i]' and reset at the end of each check. The block also resets the check flag 'check_dq_tdipw[i]'."
