It manages write and read transactions from the Wishbone interface and translates them into commands suitable for taking action upon DDR3 memory. In particular, the module maintains mechanisms for write buffer, error handling, write and read command formation, data reading, and data writing. Each of these mechanisms involves careful generation of control bits and the handling of data, ensuring that data written to or read from DDR3 memory respects the expected formats and protocols."
