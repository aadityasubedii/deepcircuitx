    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for assigning values to system clock and Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) signals. The system clock signal `sysclk_2x_bufpll_o` is set to be equal to `ioclk0`, and `sysclk_2x_180_bufpll_o` is set as `ioclk180`. On the other hand, the signals `pll_ce_0_bufpll_o` and `pll_ce_90_bufpll_o` are assigned the current state of `pll_ce_0_i` and `pll_ce_90_i` respectively."
