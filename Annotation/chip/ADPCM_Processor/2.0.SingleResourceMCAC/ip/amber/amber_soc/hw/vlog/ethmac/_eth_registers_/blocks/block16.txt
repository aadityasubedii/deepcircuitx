Comment: 
This block of code defines a synchronous dataset. The system waits for either a rising edge in the clock signal (Clk) or a sudden positive shift in the reset signal (Reset). If a Reset signal is captured, it sets the variable `SetRxCIrq_sync1` to zero with a propagation delay (`#Tp`). If no Reset signal is detected, `SetRxCIrq_sync1` is set to the value of `SetRxCIrq_rxclk` signal with the same delay.
