    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is utilized for the purpose of assigning the value of the least significant bit of the shift_through_reg register to the DRP_SDI signal. It accomplishes its function by using the 'assign' keyword followed by the designated signal (DRP_SDI), the assignment operator (=), and the indexed value from the register shift_through_reg[0].\n"
