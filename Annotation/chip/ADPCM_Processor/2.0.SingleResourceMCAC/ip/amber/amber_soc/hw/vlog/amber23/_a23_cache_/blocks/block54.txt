Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used to handle memory miss events in a cache memory system. When a write-back request(`o_wb_req`) is asserted at the positive edge of the clock, the current address(`i_address`) that resulted in a cache miss is saved in the `miss_address` register. This register might be used later to fetch the missed content from a larger but slower memory system, therefore handling the miss event effectively and guaranteeing coherency in the caching system.
