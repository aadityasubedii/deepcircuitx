Comment: 
The block is a single process that executes upon a positive edge trigger of the 15th (index 14) bit of the dqs_odd signal. This positive edge detection is implemented using the always @(posedge...) construct in Verilog. Once triggered, the block invokes the function `dqs_odd_receiver` with the value 14 as the argument, which presumably operates on the 15th bit of some data, perhaps related to data receiving or processing.
