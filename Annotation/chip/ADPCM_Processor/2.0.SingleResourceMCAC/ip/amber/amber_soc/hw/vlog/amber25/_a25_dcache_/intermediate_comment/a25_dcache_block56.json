    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs the function of updating the address of a write-back (wb) cache. This is achieved using sequential logic that responds to a rising edge clock signal i_clk. When a write-back cache request is made (o_wb_cached_req signal is high), the wb_address will be updated with the input address (i_address). Alternatively, when a ready signal for a write-back cache (i_wb_cached_ready) is high and the fill_state is true, the code will update the write-back address (wb_address) by preserving the top 28 bits of the existing address, incrementing the next two bits, and setting the lowest two bits to zero."
