Comment: 
This block of code handles interrupt signals in a synchronous design. On each rising edge of the clock, if the core is not being stalled, it takes an incoming interrupt signal and writes it into the 'interrupt_d1' register. If there are any non-zero interrupts present and the interrupt state is on, it proceeds to categorize the interrupt type and writes the type of interrupt as a string into the 'decompile_file'. Afterwards, according to the type of interrupt, it fetches a corresponding return address by calling the 'get_reg_val' function with different inputs, converting it into a printable string via the 'pcf' function, and writes the string into the 'decompile_file'.
