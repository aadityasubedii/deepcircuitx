Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls the signal `data_valid` for determining the validation of data. Whenever there's a clock edge, the signal `data_valid` is reset to '0' if the reset signal (`rst_i[0]`) is on. If the user burst count (`user_burst_cnt`) equals '1' and data port FIFO is ready (`data_port_fifo_rdy`), `data_valid` is set to '0' indicating no valid data. But, if the user burst count is greater or equal to '1' or a command start (`cmd_start`), `data_valid` is set to '1' indicating valid data.
