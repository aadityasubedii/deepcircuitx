Comment: 
The block assigns `fill_state` to the result of `c_state` equal to `CS_FILL3`. This assignment operation means that `fill_state` will be true when current state(`c_state`) is `CS_FILL3`, thus, indicating that the system is in a `CS_FILL3` state. It is essentially a way of tracking the current state of the hardware system.
