Read requests come with valid signal and address and burst length information. During operation, it ensures smooth data read operation while maintaining the order. This module can manage read requests from different sources and allows customization parameter like TCQ, FAMILY, MEM_BURST_LEN, ADDR_WIDTH, and BL_WIDTH based on the specific requirements. Details of read requests are stored in a FIFO using afifo module. It has also several control signals for better management of FIFO states, like readiness, emptiness or fullness. It calculates the number of free positions or slots left in the FIFO buffer for further storage. The control flow in the design takes care of system reset, FIFO read-write enablement conditions and wait states."
