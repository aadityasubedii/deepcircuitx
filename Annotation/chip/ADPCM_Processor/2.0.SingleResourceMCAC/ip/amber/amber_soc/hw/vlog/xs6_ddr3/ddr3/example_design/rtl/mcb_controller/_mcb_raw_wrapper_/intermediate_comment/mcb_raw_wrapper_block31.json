    "block_comment": "This block of code is a counter that increments its value for every positive edge of the clock signal. It utilizes a conditional control flow statement that operates based on the state of 'clear' and 'enable' signals. When 'clear' signal is high, the counter is instantaneously reset to a predefined value. If the 'clear' signal is low but the 'enable' signal is high, the counter value increments with each rising edge of the clock. If neither 'enable' nor 'clear' is high, the counter value remains unchanged."
