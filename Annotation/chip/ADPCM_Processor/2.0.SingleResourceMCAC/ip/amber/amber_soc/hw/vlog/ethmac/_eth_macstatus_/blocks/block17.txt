The given Verilog code block is used to assign a boolean signal `ReceivedPacketGood`, which indicates the status of received data packet, based on `LatchedCrcError`. The operation is carried out by performing a bitwise NOT operation on the `LatchedCrcError` signal, such that if there's a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error detected (`LatchedCrcError` = 1), `ReceivedPacketGood` will be set to `0` (not good packet), otherwise `ReceivedPacketGood` will be set to `1` (valid packet received).
