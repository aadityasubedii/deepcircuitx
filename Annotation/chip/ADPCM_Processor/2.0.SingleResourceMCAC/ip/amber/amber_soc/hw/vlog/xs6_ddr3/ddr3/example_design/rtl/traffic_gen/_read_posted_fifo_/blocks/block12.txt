This block is designed to manage the status of 'wait_done' signal, a flag that indicates completion of a waiting period. At each positive edge of the clock, if a reset signal is received, 'wait_done' is immediately set high (1). Conversely, if both 'cmd_rdy_o' signal, indicating command readiness, and 'cmd_valid_i' signal are true, 'wait_done' is set low (0). If the waiting count 'wait_cnt' hits zero, 'wait_done' is set high (1). Otherwise, 'wait_done' remains low (0). The delays '#TCQ' are inferred to model the reality of propagation delays.
