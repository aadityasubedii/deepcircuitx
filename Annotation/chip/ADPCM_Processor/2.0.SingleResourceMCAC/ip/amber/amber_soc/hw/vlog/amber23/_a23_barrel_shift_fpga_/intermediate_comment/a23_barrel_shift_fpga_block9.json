    "block_comment": "The block of code mainly performs rotating right (ROR), where data from a specific input point moves to the right side of the same point after shifting. Two bits of the 'ror_out' array are assigned values based on the conditions of 'i_shift_imm_zero' and 'shift_nzero'. Firstly, 'ror_out[0]' is decided based on 'i_shift_imm_zero': if it is true, 'i_carry_in' is considered, otherwise 'p_r[31]' is assigned. Similarly, for 'ror_out[1]', if 'i_shift_imm_zero' is true, 'i_in[0]' is considered, if it's false and 'shift_nzero' is true then it takes 'p_r[31]', else 'i_carry_in' is assigned to it."
