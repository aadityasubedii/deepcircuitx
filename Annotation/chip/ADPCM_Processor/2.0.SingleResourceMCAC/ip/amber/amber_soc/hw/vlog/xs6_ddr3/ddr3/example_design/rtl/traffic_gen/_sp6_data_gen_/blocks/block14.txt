Comment: 
This block is a signal assignment block for the variable 'w1data', resetting or changing its values based on certain conditions. On a positive edge of the clock, if a reset signal is set, 'w1data' is cleared. Else if either 'fifo_rdy_i' flag is active and 'user_burst_cnt' is not zero or 'cmd_startC' is active, its value is modified based on certain subconditions. These subconditions are based on the value of 'NUM_DQ_PINS', 'addr_i', 'data_mode_i' signal values or flag states. The 'w1data' value is either assigned from predefined shifts or through certain conditionally concatenated values. The block of code is written in structured style, coupled with succinct use of Verilog's concurrent capabilities and conditional constructs.
