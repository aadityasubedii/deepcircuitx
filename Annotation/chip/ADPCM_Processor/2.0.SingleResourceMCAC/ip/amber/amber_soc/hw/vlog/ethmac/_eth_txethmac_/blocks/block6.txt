Comment: 
This line of code is responsible for detecting when a packet transmission has completed or failed. The packet transmission is considered complete under any one of the following conditions: StartTxDone, TooBig, UnderRun, LateCollision, MaxCollisionOccured, or ExcessiveDeferOccured flags are set. These flags indicate various events, such as the completion of a Start Transmission command (StartTxDone), a packet exceeding the allowable size (TooBig), failure to provide data in time (UnderRun), occurrences of a late collision (LateCollision), reaching the maximum count of allowed collisions (MaxCollisionOccured), or excessive deferral of transmission (ExcessiveDeferOccured).
