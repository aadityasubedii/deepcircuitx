Comment: 
The block of code is centered around a flip-flop that is designed to monitor and react to whether a given condition designated 'empty' is active or inactive. This operation is synchronous with the system clock's positive edge, indicated by 'posedge clk_i'. The timescale it follows is defined by '#TCQ'. The value of 'empty' is assigned to 'empty_r' at each positive edge of the clock cycle.
