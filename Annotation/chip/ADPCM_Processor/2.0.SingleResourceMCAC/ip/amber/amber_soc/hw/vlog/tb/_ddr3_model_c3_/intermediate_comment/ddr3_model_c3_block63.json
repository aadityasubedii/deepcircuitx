    "block_comment": "This block of code checks for a positive edge timing on the 'dqs_in' of index 2. A dedicated subroutine 'dqs_pos_timing_check' is invoked every time a positive edge is detected on the third DQS (Data Quick Switch) line connoted by 'dqs_in[2]', providing live tracking of timing."
