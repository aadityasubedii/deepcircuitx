This block is a sequential process that is responsible for data generation based on the input address (addr_i) and data mode (data_mode_i). The output is a word of data (w1data), whose value is determined by applying the data generation functions Data_Gen and Data_GenW0 corresponding to input address and matching data mode. The case statement selects one of many possible executions based on addr_i. If no match is found, default clause is executed where zero is assigned to w1data. Data shift operation is performed when the value of MEM_BURST_LEN is 8. The block operates on the rising edge of the input clock (clk_i).
