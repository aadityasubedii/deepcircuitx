The block of code is utilized for performing address timing verification, specifically for checking the command-address signals of SDRAM memory chips. This is achieved by the 'always' keyword which ensures that the block of code responds to any changes in the 'cas_n_in' signal value. Function 'cmd_addr_timing_check()' is then called with an input argument of '2', setting a wait period for the desired timing verification.
