    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code essentially aids in managing command readiness within the application or hardware. It works by assigning the 'cmd_rdy_o' variable the value of a logical operation, specifically, when there is a positive edge on the clock ('clk_i'); the readiness of command is controlled by three conditions - the negation of the 'full' flag, the 'dfifo_has_enough_room' flag, and the 'wait_done' flag. The block, therefore, helps in checking and deciding the state of the command readiness based on whether there is enough room in the FIFO, whether the FIFO is full, and whether the waiting is completed, ensuring robust command management."
