    "block_comment": "This code block mainly initiates specific code sequences based on the condition of 'data_mode_i'. It essentially serves a multiplexer function with 'data_mode_i' as a selector. When 'data_mode_i' is 3'b101 or 3'b100, 'BLANK', 'SHIFT_0' to 'SHIFT_7' are assigned hexadecimal values from 0 to 80 respectively. The identical values are assigned when 'data_mode_i' is 3'b100. However, when 'data_mode_i' is 3'b110 or any other value, 'BLANK', 'SHIFT_0' to 'SHIFT_7' assume hexadecimal values from FF to 7F, respectively, reflecting a bit inversion from the previous values."
