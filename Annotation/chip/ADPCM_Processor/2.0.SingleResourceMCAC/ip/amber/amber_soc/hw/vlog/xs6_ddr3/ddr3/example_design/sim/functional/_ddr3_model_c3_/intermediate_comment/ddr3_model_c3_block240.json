    "block_comment": "This block manages the simulation of a delay for the write enable (we_n) signal to mimic real-world hardware conditions. The always block in Verilog is triggered by a change in the we_n signal, upon which it introduces a delay defined by BUS_DELAY before updating the signal we_n_in. This conveys a more realistic scenario where changes in the we_n signal aren't immediately reflected in the we_n_in signal due to inherent bus delays. The implication is that we_n_in follows we_n with a delay of BUS_DELAY units."
