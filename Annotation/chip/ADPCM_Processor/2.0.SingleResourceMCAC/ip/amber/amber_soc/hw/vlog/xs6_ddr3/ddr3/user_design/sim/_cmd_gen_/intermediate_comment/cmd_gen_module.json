    "module": "Module-level comment: This module generates memory commands (address, instruction, burst length) for a memory controller. It supports multiple address generation modes (BRAM, fixed, PRBS, sequential), instruction modes, and burst length modes. The module uses PRBS generators, counters, and multiplexers to create flexible command streams based on input parameters. It handles timing, read buffer management, and supports different FPGA families (Spartan-6 and Virtex-6). The module also includes features for refresh commands and address range checking to ensure proper memory access patterns."
