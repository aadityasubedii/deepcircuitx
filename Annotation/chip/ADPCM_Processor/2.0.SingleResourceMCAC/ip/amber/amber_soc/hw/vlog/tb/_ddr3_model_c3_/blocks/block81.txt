Comment: 
The block is intended to monitor changes in the 50th bit (index 49) of the `dq_in` signal and invoke the function `dq_timing_check()` whenever a change occurs. It is realized using an `always` statement for sensitivity to alterations in the 50th bit of `dq_in`, triggering `dq_timing_check()` function which potentially includes operations handling such changes.
