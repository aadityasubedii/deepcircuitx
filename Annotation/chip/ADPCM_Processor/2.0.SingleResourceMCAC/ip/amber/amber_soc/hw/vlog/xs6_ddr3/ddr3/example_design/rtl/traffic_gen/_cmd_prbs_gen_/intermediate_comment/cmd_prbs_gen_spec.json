These sequences are utilized in testing communication circuits. The PRBS generator is parameterized by the type of command (PRBS_CMD), the width of the Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS_WIDTH), the seed width (SEED_WIDTH), among other parameters. \n\nInput ports include clk_i (Clock Input) used to synchronize the operation of the module, prbs_seed_init that initiates PRBS generation, clk_en a clock enable signal for controlling the generator\u2019s operation, and prbs_seed_i, a seed input for the PRBS generator of size SEED_WIDTH. The output port, prbs_o, emits the generated PRBS for utilization in other modules for testing purposes. \n\nInternal signals within the module include prbs, a register that holds the generated PRBS, lfsr_q, a register forming the core of the PRBS generation and the wire signal, ZEROS of size ADDR_WIDTH, which is universally assigned a zero value. \n\nThe module is divided into three main generate-if blocks correlating to different PRBS_CMD conditions. For \"ADDRESS\" command and PRBS_WIDTH as 64, a 64-bit shift register is used, and for PRBS_WIDTH as 32, a 32-bit shift register is used. When the command is \"INSTR\" or \"BLEN\", a 20-bit shift register gets utilized. These registers are then used to generate or manipulate the PRBS. Additionally, there is a logb2 function responsible for the calculation of logarithm base 2 of an input integer - a function used within the 32-bit shift register generate block. The generated PRBS can then be used by other modules for testing communication circuits.",

These sequences are utilized in testing communication circuits. The PRBS generator is parameterized by the type of command (PRBS_CMD), the width of the Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS_WIDTH), the seed width (SEED_WIDTH), among other parameters. \n\nInput ports include clk_i (Clock Input) used to synchronize the operation of the module, prbs_seed_init that initiates PRBS generation, clk_en a clock enable signal for controlling the generator\u2019s operation, and prbs_seed_i, a seed input for the PRBS generator of size SEED_WIDTH. The output port, prbs_o, emits the generated PRBS for utilization in other modules for testing purposes. \n\nInternal signals within the module include prbs, a register that holds the generated PRBS, lfsr_q, a register forming the core of the PRBS generation and the wire signal, ZEROS of size ADDR_WIDTH, which is universally assigned a zero value. \n\nThe module is divided into three main generate-if blocks correlating to different PRBS_CMD conditions. For \"ADDRESS\" command and PRBS_WIDTH as 64, a 64-bit shift register is used, and for PRBS_WIDTH as 32, a 32-bit shift register is used. When the command is \"INSTR\" or \"BLEN\", a 20-bit shift register gets utilized. These registers are then used to generate or manipulate the PRBS. Additionally, there is a logb2 function responsible for the calculation of logarithm base 2 of an input integer - a function used within the 32-bit shift register generate block. The generated PRBS can then be used by other modules for testing communication circuits."
