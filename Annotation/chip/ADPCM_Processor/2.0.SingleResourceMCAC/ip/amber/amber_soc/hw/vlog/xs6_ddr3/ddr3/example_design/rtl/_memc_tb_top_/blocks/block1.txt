This code block is for command field mapping in different read and write modes for a multi-port memory controller. Based on the logic in this code block, when port 5 is enabled, it checks the mode of operation (either read "RD_MODE" or otherwise). If it's in the read mode, it checks which other port is enabled. Each command field of the enabled port (such as command enable, command instruction, command address, command block length, command write enable) is then assigned to the respective command field of port 5. If Port 5 is in write mode, the module simply assigns the p5_mcb signals to the identical p5_mcb signal.
