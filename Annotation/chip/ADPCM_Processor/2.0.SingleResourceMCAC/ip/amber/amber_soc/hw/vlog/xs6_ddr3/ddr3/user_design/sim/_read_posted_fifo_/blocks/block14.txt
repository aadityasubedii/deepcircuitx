Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles the readiness of commands. It uses a flip-flop that gets updated at every positive edge of the input clock. The command readiness (`cmd_rdy_o`) is determined by three conditions: the command queue is not full (`!full`), the downstream FIFO has enough room (`dfifo_has_enough_room`), and the waiting process is complete (`wait_done`). All conditions need to be true to make the command ready, indicated by high state of `cmd_rdy_o`.
