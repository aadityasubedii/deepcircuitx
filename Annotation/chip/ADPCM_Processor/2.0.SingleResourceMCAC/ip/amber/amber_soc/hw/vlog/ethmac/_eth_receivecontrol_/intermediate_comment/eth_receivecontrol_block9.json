    "block_comment": "The block checks if the PauseTimer has reached zero. This is done by performing a bitwise OR operation on all the bits in the PauseTimer (a 16-bit register ranging from PauseTimer[15] to PauseTimer[0]), then the result is inverted using a bitwise not operation. This results in a high (1) output for PauseTimerEq0 when all bits in PauseTimer are zero (indicating the timer has reached zero), and a low (0) output otherwise."
