    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for performing a timing check when there is a positive edge on the 14th bit of the 'dqs_in' signal. Using an always block triggered at the rising edge of 'dqs_in[13]', it calls the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function with '13' as the argument, which effectively checks the timing at this specific signal transition."
