    "block_comment": "This block manages the start of a transmission frame in a write buffer (WB). It is working synchronously with either the positive edge of the WB clock or a reset signal. If a reset signal is received, the transmission start frame (TxStartFrm_wb) is set to 0, resetting the operation. In the absence of a reset, if TxBDReady is high, no previous start occurred (StartOccured is low), and either the transmission buffer is full (TxBufferFull) or the transmission length is zero (TxLengthEq0), TxStartFrm_wb would be set to 1, initiating a transmission frame. Otherwise, if a start frame was previously synchronized (TxStartFrm_syncb2 is high), the block sets TxStartFrm_wb to 0 again."
