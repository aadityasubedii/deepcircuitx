    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs data generation for a memory system using the specific data generation functions, depending on the value of data_mode_i and the input address. On each rising edge of the clock signal, if the FIFO module is ready or the start command is triggered, it checks for the data generation selection logic. Depending on the selected logic, data generation function is selected based on 5 bits of the input address (addr_i). The case constructs select different data generation methods for different address ranges with a custom delay time (TCQ). If the data mode is 4'b0101, the data generation method Data_Gen(n) is used; else, Data_GenW0(n) method is used. 'n' stands for an integer in the range [0,23]. For addresses greater than 23 or not listed, a default value of 'b0 is assigned to w1data. An else clause is present for handling when MEM_BURST_LEN equals 8, which adjusts the values in w1data for different ranges."
