    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for providing clocking resources for a memory controller block (MCB) on a Spartan-6 FPGA. If the `C_MCB_USE_EXTERNAL_BUFPLL` bit is not set, an internal BUFPLL_MCB module is instantiated. This module divides the input clock by 2 and aligns the IO and system clocks. When the PLL is locked, both clock enable signals are generated from the PLL outputs. Conversely, if the flag is set, this means that an external BUFPLL is being used. In this case, the input clocks and clock enable signals are assigned directly, and the PLL lock signal is passed through directly."
