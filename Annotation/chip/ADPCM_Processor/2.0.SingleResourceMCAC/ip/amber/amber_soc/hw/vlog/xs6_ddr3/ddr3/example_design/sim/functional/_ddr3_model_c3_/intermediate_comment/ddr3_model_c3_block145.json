    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to monitor changes in signal `dm_in[2]` and reactively call the `dm_timing_check(2)` function. The `always @` statement defines a set of conditions, specifically the change of `dm_in[2]` signal, that trigger execution of procedural statements which in this case is the `dm_timing_check(2)` function. This structural block ensures proper timing control in the circuit by continuously monitoring and adjusting timing as per the digital signal variations in `dm_in[2]`."
