Comment: 
The block of code is a simulation check that alerts about any error conditions in the FIFO (First In, First Out) mechanism of data transfer. If the SIMULATION variable is set to "TRUE", the block instantiates the named block "cmd_check", which creates a FIFO transfer mechanism with error monitoring. This is achieved through the use of a register "fifo_error" to track any errors and two wires - "xfer_addr" to hold the transfer address, and "cmd_fifo_rd" to carry the read command for the FIFO. A "cmd_fifo_wr" output signal is also configured, which gets high if both "flow2cmd_rdy" and "cmd2flow_valid" are high, allowing the FIFO to be written.
