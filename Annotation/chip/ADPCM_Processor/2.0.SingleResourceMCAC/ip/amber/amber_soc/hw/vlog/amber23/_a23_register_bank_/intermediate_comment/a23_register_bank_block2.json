    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a multiplexer (MUX), which selects and forwards one input to the output based on the selection line. The selection of the input is made using the `i_rn_sel` selection line ranging from 0 to 14. Depending on this selection, one of the possible 16 input values (`r0_out` to `r15_out_rn`) are assigned to the output `o_rn`. This is achieved through a simple ternary operation for each potential input choice, allowing for a compact and easily read implementation."
