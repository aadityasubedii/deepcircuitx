    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the synchronization of the 'run_traffic' signal with system's clock. Every time there is a positive edge in the system clock, 'clk_i', the state of 'run_traffic' is captured and passed on to 'run_traffic_o'. This is essentially a one-cycle-register or flip-flop mechanism, acting as a synchronizer, ensuring the associated 'run_traffic' related operations align with the system clock cycle, preventing any timing-related issues or instabilities."
