    "block_comment": "This code block provides conditional hardware generation based on whether the AXI interface is enabled (C_S2_AXI_ENABLE). If the interface is not enabled (C_S2_AXI_ENABLE == 0), all internal and system-level signals are directly connected, allowing the passing of data and control signals. If the AXI interface is enabled, the code block first masks the address signals. Then, it synchronizes the 'calibration done' signal (uo_done_cal) to the clock (s2_axi_aclk) using the `mcb_ui_top_synch` module. Additionally, it interfaces to the 'axi_mcb' module with numerous AXI and custom signals expanded and connected to both the environment and internal signals, hence acting as the bridge between the AXI and the custom interface."
