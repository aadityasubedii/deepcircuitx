This block expands and shifts an 8-bit input data to a 9-bit output using custom rules. If each two consecutive bits from the input are '10', these bits are expanded to two '1's in the output; otherwise, they are expanded to a combination of the input's current bit and the previous bit in the output. The shift occurs from the least significant bit to the most significant bit, thus expanding the 8-bit input into a 9-bit output.
