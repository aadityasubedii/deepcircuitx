    "block_comment": "This block of code performs synchronous and asynchronous reset operations along with driving the input to the output on receiving a write signal. On every positively edged clock cycle or when Reset signal is high, seriatim conditions check for respective Reset or SyncReset to be high triggering asynchronous or synchronous reset of DataOut with RESET_VALUE. If neither reset conditions are met and the Write signal is high, data is transferred from DataIn to DataOut."
