The fetch module decodes and determines whether an incoming address should be served by the cache memory or Wishbone bus based on factors like whether the requested address is cacheable or not, if address validation is successful, the cache enable signal among others. When an address is valid and cacheable, the cache memory module is selected, otherwise, the Wishbone bus is selected. This module also handles stalls from both the system end and the Wishbone or cache memory interface. Read data returned to the processor is from the cache memory if it was selected or the Wishbone data if the latter was selected. The module includes a cache sub-module \"a23_cache\" and Wishbone interface \"a23_wishbone\" that the controller effectively manages."
