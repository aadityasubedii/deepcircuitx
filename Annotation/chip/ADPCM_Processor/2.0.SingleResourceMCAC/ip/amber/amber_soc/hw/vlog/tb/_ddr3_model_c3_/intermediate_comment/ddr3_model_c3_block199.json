    "block_comment": "This block initiates a receiver whenever there's a rising edge on the 10th bit of the 'dqs_even' signal. Specifically, the 'always @' construct is a procedural block in Verilog that gets triggered based on changes in its sensitivity list - 'posedge dqs_even[9]' in this case. When the 10th bit (noted as 9 because of 0 indexing) of 'dqs_even' signal has a positive edge change, it triggers the 'dqs_even_receiver' function for that bit."
