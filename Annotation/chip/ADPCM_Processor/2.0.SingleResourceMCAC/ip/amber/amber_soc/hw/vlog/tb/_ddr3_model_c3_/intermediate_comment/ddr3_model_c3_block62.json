    "block_comment": "This block of code executes a function \"dqs_pos_timing_check\" during every positive edge trigger of the third bit in the \"dqs_in\" array. The \"always @(posedge dqs_in[ 3])\" is a statement that informs the Verilog simulator that the function inside the \"always\" block executes whenever there is a positive edge change in the third bit of the \"dqs_in\" signal. It is commonly used in coding synchronous circuitry, where operations should only occur on a certain edge of a clock signal."
