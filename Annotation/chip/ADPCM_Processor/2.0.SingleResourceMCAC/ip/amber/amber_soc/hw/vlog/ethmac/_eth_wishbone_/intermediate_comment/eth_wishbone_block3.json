    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a synchronizer for a busy IRQ signal. This synchronizer works by steadily shifting the busy IRQ signal across three flip flops at each positive edge of the writeback clock through a non-blocking assignment mechanism (`<=`). This sequential shift is instrumental in mitigating metastability issues by adequately isolating a busy IRQ signal from one clock domain and presenting it to another. Hence, the busyness of the IRQ is safely signalled across clock domains."
