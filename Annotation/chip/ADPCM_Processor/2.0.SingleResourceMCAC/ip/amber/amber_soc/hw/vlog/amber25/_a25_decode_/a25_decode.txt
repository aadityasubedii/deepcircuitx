Module-level comment: This module decodes ARM instructions and generates control signals for an ARM processor core. It implements a state machine to handle various instruction types, including data processing, memory operations, branches, and interrupts. The decoder manages instruction execution, pipeline stages, and special cases like multiple register transfers. It processes input signals, decodes instructions, handles interrupts, and outputs control signals for ALU, register selection, memory access, and status updates.
