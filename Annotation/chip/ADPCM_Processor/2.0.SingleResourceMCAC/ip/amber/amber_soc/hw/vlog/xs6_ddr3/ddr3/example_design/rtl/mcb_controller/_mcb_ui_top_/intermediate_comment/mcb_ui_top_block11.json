    "block_comment": "The block of code is a conditionally activated section responsible for assignment of interface signals. When the `C_S4_AXI_ENABLE` is deasserted, this block assigns various control and data signals related to command, write, and read interfaces between the AXI interconnect and a memory controller block (MCB). This involves direct assignment of input signals such as command enable, instruction, byte address, etc. to their corresponding internal signals. Similarly, it assigns the status of command, write, and read operations such as full, empty, error to the respective output signals."
