Comment: 
This block is a conditional hardware assignment based on the value of a port-enable signal (C_PORT_ENABLE[0]). If C_PORT_ENABLE[0] is 1, several variables of the design begin to copy the values from corresponding terms on the right hand side, facilitating signal assignment and toggling between high and low state. If C_PORT_ENABLE[0] is 0, then all specified variables are set to zero, making them inactive or resetting them. The block has two major segments, both dealing with the assignment of a set of signals, but each branch of the conditional statement provides different behaviors depended on the value of C_PORT_ENABLE[0].
