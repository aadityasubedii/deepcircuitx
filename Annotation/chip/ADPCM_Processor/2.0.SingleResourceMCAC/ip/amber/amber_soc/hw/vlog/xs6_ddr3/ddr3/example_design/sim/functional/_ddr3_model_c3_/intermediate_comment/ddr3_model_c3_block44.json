    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for launching a timing check function whenever there is a negative edge detected on the 22nd bit of the input 'dqs_in'. It achieves this functionality by using the 'always' keyword in conjunction with the '@(negedge ..)' trigger, which together monitor for any negative transition in the specific bit of 'dqs_in'. Upon detecting such a transition, the code promptly calls the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function with an index '21'."
