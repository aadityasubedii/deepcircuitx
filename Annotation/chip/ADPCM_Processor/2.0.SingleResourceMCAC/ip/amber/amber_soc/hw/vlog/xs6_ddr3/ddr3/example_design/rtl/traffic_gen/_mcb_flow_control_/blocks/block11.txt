This line of code defines an assign statement in Verilog. Its purpose is to assign the value of the variable wdp_validC to wdp_validC_o. It's a simple mapping from one signal to another, which will be evaluated continuously or whenever there is a change in the value of wdp_validC. The code essentially creates a continuous assignment, allowing changes in the value of wdp_validC to immediately reflect in wdp_validC_o.
