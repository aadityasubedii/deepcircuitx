This code block is responsible for detecting and reporting cache access anomalies in a four-way cache system. It operates synchronously with the rising edge of the input clock. The code checks if the sum of the hits in all cache ways exceeds 1, indicating that there are hits in more than one cache way. In such a scenario, it flags an error through a testbench error message, and prominently displays the error message "Hit in more than one cache ways!".
