This Verilog code block is responsible for the generation of the Universal Double Data Rate (UDQS) IO Buffer which interfaces with the memory components. Depending upon the type of memory (DDR, MDDR, and certain types of DDR2) and the number of data pins (DQ pins), a specific type of IO buffer is generated. If the memory type is either DDR, MDDR, or DDR2 (with no DDR2 Different DQS enabled) and the number of DQ pins is 16, then the simple IOBUF is deployed. However, in other cases with 16 DQ pins, a more general IOBUFDS is implemented.
