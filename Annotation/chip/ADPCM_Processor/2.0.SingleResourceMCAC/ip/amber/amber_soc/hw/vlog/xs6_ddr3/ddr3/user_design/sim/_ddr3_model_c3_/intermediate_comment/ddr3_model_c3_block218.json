    "block_comment": "The function of the block is to erase specific memory banks. If MAX_MEM is defined, it iterates over the specified banks and if a bank is set for erasure, it closes the file associated with the bank and opens a new empty one. If MAX_MEM is not defined, instead of interacting with files, it operates directly on arrays 'address' and 'memory'. It iterates over the used memory, moving non-erased memory to the front of the arrays, then marks the leftover indices as undefined. The size of the used memory is updated to exclude the erased memory cells."
