    "block_comment": "This block is a instantiation of a multiplication module `a25_multiply`. It takes two inputs for multiplication from `rs` and `rm`, and then flags for operation and execution controls through `i_multiply_function` and `execute` inputs. The multiplication result is then passed out through `multiply_out` port, along with any flags via `multiply_flags`. The operation status can be monitored through `o_multiply_done`. The block works synchronously with the system clock `i_clk` and can be stalled using the `i_core_stall` signal."
