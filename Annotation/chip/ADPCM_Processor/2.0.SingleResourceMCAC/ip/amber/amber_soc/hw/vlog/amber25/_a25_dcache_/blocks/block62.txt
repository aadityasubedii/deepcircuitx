Comment: 
This Verilog RTL code describes a cache memory system's control state machine. The memory cache system is flushed when a high signal on `i_cache_flush` is detected, which initializes the state machine to `CS_INIT` phase, and on each subsequent clock cycle, all cache line addresses are iterated through until they've all been accessed. The state machine moves to several other states like `CS_IDLE`, `CS_FILL`, `CS_FILL_COMPLETE`, `CS_TURN_AROUND`, `CS_EX_DELETE`, `CS_WRITE_HIT`, `CS_WRITE_HIT_WAIT_WB`, and `CS_WRITE_MISS_WAIT_WB`, handling different scenarios such as read hits, read misses, write hits, and write misses, contingent on conditions such as read/write hit flags and cache ready flags. The `source_sel` variable allows different states to access or manipulate the cache data. Debug messages are displayed when the cache flush and cache deletion operations occur (only when `A25_CACHE_DEBUG` is defined).
