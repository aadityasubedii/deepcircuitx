    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to write data to a file. It accomplishes this by defining a task `write_to_file` with parameters `fd` (file descriptor), `index` (index for data placement in file), and `data` (the data to be written, in binary). The decimal value of `index` is multiplied by `RFF_CHUNK` to obtain the offset. File seeking is performed with `$fseek` using the file descriptor, offset, and origin positioned at the beginning. If not successful, an error message is displayed and execution is halted. The block also incorporates error handling for the data value `1'bz`. If this is encountered, it gets replaced with `1'bx`, if the data is `1'b0`, it gets replaced with `1'bz`. Finally, data is written to the file using the `$fwrite` system task."
