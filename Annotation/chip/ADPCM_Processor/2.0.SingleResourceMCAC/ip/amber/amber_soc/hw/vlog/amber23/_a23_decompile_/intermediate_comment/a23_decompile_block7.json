    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a task that writes a hexadecimal value to a given file, truncating leading zeros. It achieves this by examining the most significant nibble of the input number and, if it's zero, discarding it and examining the next most significant nibble. This process continues until a non-zero nibble is identified or all nibbles are examined. The resulting number (with truncated leading zeros) is then written to the specified file in hexadecimal format."
