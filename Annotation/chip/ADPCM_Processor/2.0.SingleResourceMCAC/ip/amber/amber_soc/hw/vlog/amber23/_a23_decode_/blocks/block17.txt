The block of code encapsulates two separate control states, MULT_PROC1 and MULT_PROC2, within a multiply processing unit. In the MULT_PROC1 state, the block initializes the pre_fetch_instruction_wen, indicating that the instruction has entered the fetch phase. Additionally, pc_wen_nxt is set to logically false, implying no writes may occur for the program counter. The multiply_function_nxt is set to the current output of the multiply function. Within the MULT_PROC2 state, writes to the program counter are again inhibited by setting pc_wen_nxt to false. The block also directs the address selector to use the third address line by assigning a value of 3 to the address_sel_nxt. The multiply_function_nxt maintains its assignment to the output of the multiply function.
