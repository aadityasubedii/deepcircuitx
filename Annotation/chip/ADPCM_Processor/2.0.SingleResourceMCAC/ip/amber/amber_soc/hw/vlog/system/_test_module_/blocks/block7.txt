This block of code is primarily responsible for writing data into the test_status_reg register. It specifically listens for the rising edge of the input clock signal (i_clk). If there's a request to start a write operation (wb_start_write is true) and the address specified (i_wb_adr[15:0]) is equal to AMBER_TEST_STATUS, then the 32-bit write-data (wb_wdata32) is stored in the register test_status_reg.
