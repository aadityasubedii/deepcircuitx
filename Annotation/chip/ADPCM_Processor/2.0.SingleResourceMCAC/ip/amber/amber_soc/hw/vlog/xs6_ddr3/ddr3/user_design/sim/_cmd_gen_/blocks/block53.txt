Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code defines a sequential logic that gets updated on positive edge of the clock input. The 'cmd_clk_en' signal is delayed by an amount '#TCQ' (presumably a timing control quantity definted elsewhere), and then assigned to the `cmd_vld` signal. The purpose of this block is to synchronize and potentially de-skew the 'cmd_clk_en' signal with respect to the clock signal 'clk_i'. The delay '#TCQ' is a tactical design choice to meet the timing constraints or to compensate for potential clock skew issues.
