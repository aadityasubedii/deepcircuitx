Comment: 
This block is designed to validate the UART transmission bit pulse count under specific requirements. It checks if TX_BITPULSE_COUNT multiplied by CLK_PERIOD is within the range of UART_BIT_PERIOD times 1.03 and times 0.97. If it doesn't fall within this range, it triggers an error message that displays the current UART transmission bit period, baud rate, baud bit period, and provides suggestions for the user to either reduce the baud rate or increase the system clock frequency for remediation.
