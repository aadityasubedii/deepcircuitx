This block captures instruction information at the positive edge of the clock signal, given there is no fetch stall. If the instruction type equals a memory transfer operation (MTRANS), or there is a write enabled on the 'saved_current_instruction', the block updates a set of 'saved instruction' variables from the next instructions. If a pre-fetch write is enabled, it also updates a different set of 'pre-fetch instruction' variables from read data and registry data. This operation helps in providing a memory-map and data integrity for instructions, which can be used in debugging or exception handling.
