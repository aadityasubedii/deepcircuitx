Comment: 
The block assigns values to three signals: `r_TxBDNum[7:0]`, `r_TxPauseTV[15:0]`, and `r_TxPauseRq`. This is done by directly binding each of these signals to corresponding portions of two output signals (`TX_BD_NUMOut` and `TXCTRLOut`). Specifically, the 8 least significant bits of `TX_BD_NUMOut` and the 16 least significant bits of `TXCTRLOut` are respectively mapped to `r_TxBDNum` and `r_TxPauseTV`. The 17th bit of `TXCTRLOut` is assigned to `r_TxPauseRq`.
