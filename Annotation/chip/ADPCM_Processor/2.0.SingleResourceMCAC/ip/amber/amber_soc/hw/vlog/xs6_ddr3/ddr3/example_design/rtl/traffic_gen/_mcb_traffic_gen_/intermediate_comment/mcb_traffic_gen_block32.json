    "block_comment": "The block of code is used for clocked data buffering. It responds to a positive edge of the input clock (clk_i) to store the current value of data_mode_i into three separate registers (data_mode_r_a, data_mode_r_b, and data_mode_r_c) with a delay equal to the specified clock quality time (#TCQ). This implementation facilitates data consistency under different processing stages in a digital system, ensuring that all three registers have an updated coherent value following the clock input."
