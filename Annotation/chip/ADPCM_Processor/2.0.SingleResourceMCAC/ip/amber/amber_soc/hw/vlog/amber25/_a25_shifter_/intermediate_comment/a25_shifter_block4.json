    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as an arithmetic shift right (ASR) operation with a certain shift amount. Depending on the specific shift amount, ranging from 0 to 31, bits of input are right-shifted accordingly, filling the left side with the sign bit. If 'i_shift_imm_zero' is set, the output is filled entirely with the sign bit of the input. If the shift amount falls outside the given range, the output is, similarly, filled entirely with the sign bit of the input."
