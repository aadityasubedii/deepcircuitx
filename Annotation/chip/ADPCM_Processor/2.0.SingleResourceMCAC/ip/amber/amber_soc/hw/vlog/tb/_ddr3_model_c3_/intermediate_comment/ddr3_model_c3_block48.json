    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates a timing check at the falling edge of the 18th bit of the 'dqs_in' signal. The 'always @' construct is used for describing a block of code which gets triggered at the specified sensitivity list, in this case, the negative edge of the 'dqs_in[17]' signal. The function 'dqs_pos_timing_check(17)' is called whenever this event is triggered, which suggests this block is used to monitor and perform timing checks on signal transitions."
