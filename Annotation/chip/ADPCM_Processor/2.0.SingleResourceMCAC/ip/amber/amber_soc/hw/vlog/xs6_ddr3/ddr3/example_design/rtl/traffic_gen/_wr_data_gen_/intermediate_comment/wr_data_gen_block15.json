    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to synchronize commands in a digital processing system. Based on the presence of an input clock signal (clk_i), it performs simultaneous checks on several command validity and readiness conditions using logical AND operations. Delay units (#TCQ) are incorporated to ensure sequential command execution corresponding to different subsystems identified by the labels C through F."
