    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for assigning data outputs based on the incoming address. When a particular `drp_ioi_addr` (IOI address) is encountered, a corresponding operation is carried out on `data_out`, and the result is stored in `data_out_mux`. This is primarily done through shifting (`<<1`) or direct assignment operation based on the specific address. Conditional compilation (`ifdef`) is also used to alter behavior based on the version (`DRP_v1_0_FIX`)."
