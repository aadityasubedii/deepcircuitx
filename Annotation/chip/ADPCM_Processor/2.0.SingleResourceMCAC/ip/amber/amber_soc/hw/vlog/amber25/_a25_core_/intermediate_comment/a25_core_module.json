    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_core module forms the primary processor for a system in Verilog RTL. Functionality of this module is subdivided into sub-modules like fetch, decode, execute, memory, write back, wishbone and coprocessor, each handling a separate stage in the processor's instruction cycle. It communicates via various input and output ports, with unique responsibilities like clock synchronisation, hardware interrupt handling, and interaction with the Wishbone system bus interface. Internal signals manage instruction processing, cache control, fault handling, registers, among others."
