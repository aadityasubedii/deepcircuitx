Module-level comment: This 'xs6_sram_256x21_line_en' module implements a 256x21 SRAM utilizing a Xilinx's single dual-port Block RAM (RAMB8BWER). Rendering synchronized read/write operations with 'i_clk', it uses 'i_address' for memory access and 'i_write_enable' for write control. The memory interfaces 'i_write_data' for input and 'o_read_data' for output. Internally, read data from RAM is split into 'read_data_lo' and 'read_data_hi' signals to form the required 21-bit wide output data. The module checks the correctness of DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH parameters and issues warnings if misplaced.
