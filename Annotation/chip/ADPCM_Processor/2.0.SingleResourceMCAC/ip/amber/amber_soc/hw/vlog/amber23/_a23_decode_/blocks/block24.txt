Comment: 
This block of code initiates a pre-fetch instruction operation. Initially, the pre_fetch_instruction_wen signal is set high to enable the operation. If the instruction execution condition, 'instruction_execute', is satisfied, the address_sel_nxt is set to 3, indicating the next address in the memory hierarchy to fetch the instruction and the program counter write enable (pc_wen_nxt) is set to 0, implying that no write operation will occur in the next clock cycle for the program counter.
