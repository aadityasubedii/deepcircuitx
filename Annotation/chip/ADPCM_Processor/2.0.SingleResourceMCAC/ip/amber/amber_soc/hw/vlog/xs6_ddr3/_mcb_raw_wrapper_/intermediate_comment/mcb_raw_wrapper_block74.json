    "block_comment": "This block is a safeguard mechanism, specifically an error checking block for system control. It checks whether certain conditions are met related to port configurations and command integrity when attempting to read from port 2 that is deemed as 'read-only'. If it detects an invalid command for port 2 under this specific 'read-only' configuration (C_PORT_CONFIG[119:96] == \"R32\"), it assigns a fatal error message to be displayed and terminates the system operation."
