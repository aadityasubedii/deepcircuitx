    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code denotes a DQS signal sampling mechanism. This operation is triggered on a positive edge of the 15th DQS odd signal. Specifically, the `always` statement introduces a procedural block that is invoked every time the specified event, in this case, the positive edge (`posedge`) of the 15th element in `dqs_odd` array, happens. The function `dqs_odd_receiver` is then called to handle the operation related to this element of the DQS odd signal."
