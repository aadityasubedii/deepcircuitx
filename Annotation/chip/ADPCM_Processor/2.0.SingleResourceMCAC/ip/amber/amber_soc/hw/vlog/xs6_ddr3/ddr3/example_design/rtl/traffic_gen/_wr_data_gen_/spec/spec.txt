Module name: wr_data_gen.

Module specification: The module 'wr_data_gen' is a data generator for handling write operations, specifically tailored for different families of FPGA technology, namely SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. It takes several inputs like clock, reset, control, and data signals besides various parameters such as family type, data width, and address width. The inputs include clk_i (clock signal), rst_i (reset signal), prbs_fseed_i (seed for pseudo-random sequence generator), data_mode_i (data mode selector), cmd_valid_i/cmd_validB_i/cmd_validC_i (command validity signals), fixed_data_i (fixed data for write operations), addr_i (address signal), bl_i (burst length), and data_rdy_i (data readiness indicator). The outputs include cmd_rdy_o (command readiness indicator), last_word_o (last word in write data burst readiness indicator), data_valid_o (data validity indicator), data_o (output data), and data_wr_end_o (end of write data indicator).

Internally, the module uses signals like data (write data), cmd_rdy to cmd_rdyF (command readiness signals), cmd_start to cmd_startF (command initiation signals), data_valid (data validity), user_burst_cnt (user-defined burst length counter), walk_cnt (binary counter), fifo_not_full (FIFO fullness check), w3data (32-bit register for computations), u_bcount_2 (checks if user burst count equals '2'), and last_word_t (checks readiness of last word in write operation). 

The Verilog code comprising the module has divided different stages of operation into separate blocks or sections handled by 'always' blocks and 'generate' blocks. They take care of operations such as initializing and controlling signals, checking conditions for different operations, performing write operation, generating data for SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 FPGA families separately based on the parameters. The module is highly clocked and registered, emphasizing its robustness for various operation scenarios in hardware applications.
