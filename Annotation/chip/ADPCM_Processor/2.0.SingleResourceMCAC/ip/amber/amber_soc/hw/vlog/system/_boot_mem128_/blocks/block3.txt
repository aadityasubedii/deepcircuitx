The block of code instantiates a memory unit from the user-defined module, u_mem. The memory module operates based on an input clock signal (i_wb_clk), a write enable signal (start_write), byte enable signal (byte_enable) to allow byte-level granularity, and an address input (address) to specify location within memory. It returns the value stored at the addressed location through the output signal (o_read_data). The data to be written to memory is provided by the i_write_data signal.
