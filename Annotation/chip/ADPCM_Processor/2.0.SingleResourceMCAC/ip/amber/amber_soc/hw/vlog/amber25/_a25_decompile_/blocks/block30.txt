This block defines a conditional logic statement for opcode comparison. It assigns the result of the comparison between the opcode and the four specific opcodes (CMP, CMN, TEQ, and TST) to the opcode_compare variable. This comparison uses bitwise OR operators to evaluate if the opcode matches any of the four given conditions.
