This block of code is a trigger for the DQS Odd Receiver on the rising edge of the 16th bit (index 15) of the DQS odd bus. In Verilog hardware description language, this specific implementation uses 'always @(posedge...)' to detect the instance when the DQS Odd Bus's 16th bit transitions from a low to high state (positive edge), and as a result, the DQS Odd Receiver function is called.
