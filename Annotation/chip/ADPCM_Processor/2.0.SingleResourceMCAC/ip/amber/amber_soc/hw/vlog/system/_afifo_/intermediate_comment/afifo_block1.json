    "block_comment": "This block is a function that converts 3-bit Gray code to binary. It takes a 3-bit input 'gray' and maps it to a binary equivalent through a case statement, which has each Gray code representation and its corresponding binary form. The conversion is direct and is based on hardcoded conversion rules. The output 'ungray8' is the 3-bit binary correspondence of the input Gray code."
