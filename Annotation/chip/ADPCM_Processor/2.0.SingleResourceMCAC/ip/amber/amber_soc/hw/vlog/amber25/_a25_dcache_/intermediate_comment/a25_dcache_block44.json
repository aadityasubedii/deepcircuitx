    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is used to manage data writes into cache memory. The block assigns data to be written into the memory in case of read miss or write hit scenarios. For read miss, the write data (read_miss_wdata) comes directly from the read data burst (wb_rdata_burst). In case of a write hit, the data word to be written (write_hit_wdata) is chosen based on the two least significant bits of the input address (i_address[3:2]). The selected data word is concatenated with appropriate portions of the hit read data (hit_rdata) depending on the specific address bits value. This ensures proper handling and updating of data in the cache memory system."
