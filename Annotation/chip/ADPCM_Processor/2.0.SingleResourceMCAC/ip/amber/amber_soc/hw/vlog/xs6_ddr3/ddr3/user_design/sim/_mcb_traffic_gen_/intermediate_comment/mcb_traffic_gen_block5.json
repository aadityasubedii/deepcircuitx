    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is used to initially set the signal `cmp_error` to zero. The `assign` statement is used in continuous assignments to drive the value of `cmp_error` with a constant logic level of '0'. The '1'b0' expression represents a single bit (1'b) with a value of zero (0). This block serves as a hardware mechanism to establish default values and ensure that the `cmp_error` signal is in a known state at the start, reducing potential for errors or glitches due to unknown states in the logic system."
