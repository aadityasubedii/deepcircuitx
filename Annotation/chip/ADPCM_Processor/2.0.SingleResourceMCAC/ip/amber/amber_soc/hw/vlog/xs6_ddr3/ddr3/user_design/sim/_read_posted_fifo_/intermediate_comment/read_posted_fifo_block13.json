    "block_comment": "This block is a counter implementation in Verilog, designed to handle timing coordination in a digital logic circuit. At every positive edge of input clock signal (clk_i), the counter wait_cnt either gets reset to 0 if reset input (rst_i) is active, or increments to binary value 10 if command ready and command valid signals (cmd_rdy_o, cmd_valid_i) are active. However, if the wait counter (wait_cnt) is currently greater than 0, it gets decremented by 1 every clock cycle. Piping command signals via a counter allows for controlled execution based on a given time delay."
