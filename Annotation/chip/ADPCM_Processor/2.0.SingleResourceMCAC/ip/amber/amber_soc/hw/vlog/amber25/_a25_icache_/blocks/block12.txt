Comment: 
This block selects the source based on a set of conditions and assigns it to the `xSOURCE_SEL` variable. The selection process is evaluated on a priority basis, with `source_sel[C_CORE]` as the top priority case and "UNKNOWN" as the default case. The mechanism follows a priority-encoder pattern where the first 'true' condition takes priority and controls the value of `xSOURCE_SEL`.
