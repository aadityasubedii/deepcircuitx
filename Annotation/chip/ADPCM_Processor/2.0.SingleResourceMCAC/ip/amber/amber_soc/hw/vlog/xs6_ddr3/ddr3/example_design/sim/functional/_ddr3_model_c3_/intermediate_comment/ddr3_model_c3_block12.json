    "block_comment": "This block uses an 'always' statement to assert a digital timing check on positive edge transitions of the 21st element of the dqs_in array. The function `dqs_neg_timing_check(20)` is implemented to handle negative timing issues for the DQS (Data strobe) signals. This check is performed whenever a positive edge transition occurs in the 21st element in `dqs_in` array, thereby ensuring the synchronous transmission of data signals."
