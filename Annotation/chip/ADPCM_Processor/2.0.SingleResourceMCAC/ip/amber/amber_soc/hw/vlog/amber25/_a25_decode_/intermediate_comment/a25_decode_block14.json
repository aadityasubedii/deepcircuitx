    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to determine and set the interrupt_mode based on the value of the next_interrupt. The block operates by comparing the next_interrupt to a set of predefined constant values (from 3'd2 to 3'd7 and 3'd1) and based on the obtained value, it assigns one of the interrupt modes (FIRQ, IRQ, SVC or USR) to interrupt_mode. The operation is implemented in a conditional statement structure (? :) where each condition and the respective assignment are defined as inline statements."
