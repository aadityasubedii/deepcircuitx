    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is used for condition checking during the pre-processing stage of RTL synthesis. The condition checks if the data width (DWIDTH) is either 64 or 128. If the condition satisfies, it initiates a labeled generate block named 'SHIFT_VALUE'. It is a part of conditional compilation, often used for accommodating different configurations or parameters within a design. The 'generate' statement allows flexibility in hardware generation based on compile-time constants."
