This block takes care of the timing check function during the falling edge of the input signal `dqs_in[1]`. Its implementation is achieved through the verilog `always @` construct, specifically on `negedge`, meaning the block of code within the construct will be executed when there is a negative edge (i.e., a transition from high to low) in the `dqs_in[1]` signal. The block then calls the function `dqs_neg_timing_check()` for timing verification using the input parameter `1`.
