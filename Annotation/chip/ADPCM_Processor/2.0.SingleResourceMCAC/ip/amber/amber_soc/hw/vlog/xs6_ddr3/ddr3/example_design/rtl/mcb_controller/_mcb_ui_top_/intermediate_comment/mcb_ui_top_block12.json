    "block_comment": "This block of code checks the condition of a flag `C_S4_AXI_ENABLE` to decide which segment of it to execute. If the flag is not set (i.e., 0), it simply assigns the values of different signals to their respective internal counterparts. If the flag is set (i.e., non-zero), it activates the memory controller blocks related to the AXI transaction. It first masks the address signals `s4_axi_araddr` and `s4_axi_awaddr` with `P_S4_AXI_ADDRMASK`. It then instantiates a synchronization module which keeps the calibration done signal (`uo_done_cal`) synchronized with the AXI clock. Finally, it instantiates the AXI memory controller block (`axi_mcb`) for this processor number (p4). The memory controller block is parameterized by multiple argument values that define its operation such as `C_S4_AXI_ID_WIDTH`, `C_S4_AXI_ADDR_WIDTH`, etc. All the signal or wires of this module correspond to different control and status signals of the AXI memory controller."
