    "block_comment": "This block assigns the signal `MasterAccessFinished` as the logical OR between `m_wb_ack_i` and `m_wb_err_i`. `MasterAccessFinished` is activated when either a successful acknowledgement signal (`m_wb_ack_i`) is received or an error signal (`m_wb_err_i`) is detected in the Wishbone bus master protocol, indicating the completion of data access by the master. The `assign` keyword is used for continuous assignment, meaning the output `MasterAccessFinished` will dynamically reflect changes in the inputs `m_wb_ack_i` and `m_wb_err_i`."
