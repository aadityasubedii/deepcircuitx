    "block_comment": "The block of code checks for certain conditions and generates specific data patterns accordingly. If the number of Data Query (DQ) pins is 104 and the data pattern matches specific types \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\", then it proceeds to generate a walking one pattern specific to this condition. This is achieved using conditional generate statement which enables a data pattern generation based on the conditions evaluated at compile-time."
