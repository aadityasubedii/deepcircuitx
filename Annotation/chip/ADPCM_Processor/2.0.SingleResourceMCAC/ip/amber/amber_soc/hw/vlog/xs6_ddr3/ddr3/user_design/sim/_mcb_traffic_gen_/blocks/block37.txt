This block is a conditional warning message for the Traffic Generator logic under certain memory conditions. If the memory burst length (MEM_BURST_LEN) is not equal to 4 or 8, it displays warning messages because the current Traffic Generator logic doesn't support On The Fly (OTF) Burst Mode or generates only BL8 traffic when the memory is set to OTF. This is implemented using an 'initial begin' block in Verilog, with the 'if' control statement to check the 'MEM_BURST_LEN' condition and '$display' system function to print the warning messages.
