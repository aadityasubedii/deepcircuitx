This block of code handles On-Die Termination (ODT) for DDR3 and DDR2 memory types. When either the static or dynamic write ODT for DDR3 or the static ODT for DDR2 is enabled (not set to "OFF"), an output buffer (OBUFT) is instantiated. The OBUFT, which has input 'ioi_odt', output 'mcbx_dram_odt', and tristate control 't_odt', electrically connects or disconnects the ODT.
