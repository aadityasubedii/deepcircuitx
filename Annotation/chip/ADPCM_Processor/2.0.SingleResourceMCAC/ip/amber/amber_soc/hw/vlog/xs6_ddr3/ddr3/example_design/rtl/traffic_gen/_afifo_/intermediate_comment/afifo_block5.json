    "block_comment": "The block of code functions as a write pointer for a data structure, typically a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) or a circular buffer, which updates on the rising edge of the read clock (rd_clk) signal. When a reset (rst) signal is detected, it sets the write pointer (wr_ptr) and write in Gray code (wr_gray) to zero. During normal operation (non-reset), if the write enable signal (wr_en) is active, it increments the write pointer on each clock cycle, effectively moving it to the next position in the buffer. Concurrently, the updated Gray code value for the write pointer is generated and stored in wr_gray when the 'wr_en' is high."
