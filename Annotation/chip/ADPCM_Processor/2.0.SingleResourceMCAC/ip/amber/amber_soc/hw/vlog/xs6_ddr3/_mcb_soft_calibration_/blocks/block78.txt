The block is a function named "Mult_Divide" that calculates a scaled version of an input signal. The scaling is performed by first multiplying the input by a specified factor, followed by a division operation. The multiplication is implemented using a repetitive addition algorithm encapsulated in a loop that adds the input to a "Result" register a "Mult" number of times. The division operation is performed by directly dividing the accumulated "Result" with the provided "Div" value. The final result is truncated to 8 bits before being returned by the function.
