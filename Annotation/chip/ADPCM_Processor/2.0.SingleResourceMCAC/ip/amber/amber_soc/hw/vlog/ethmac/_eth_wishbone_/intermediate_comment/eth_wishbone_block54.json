    "block_comment": "This block of code is a selector for received data bytes, based on a 2-bit least significant bits (LSB) pointer. It leverages a 2-bit 'case' structure to alter the value of the 4-bit RxByteSel variable based on the value of RxPointerLSB_rst[1:0]. In case RxPointerLSB_rst[1:0] is 2'h0, RxByteSel[3:0] is assigned the value 4'hf, when it's 2'h1, RxByteSel[3:0] is assigned the value 4'h7, when it's 2'h2, RxByteSel[3:0] becomes 4'h3 and finally when it's 2'h3, RxByteSel[3:0] is assigned the value 4'h1."
