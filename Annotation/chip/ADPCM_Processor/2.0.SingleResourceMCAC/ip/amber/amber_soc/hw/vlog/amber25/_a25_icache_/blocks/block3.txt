The block monitors the "data_hit_way" array for cache hits and raises an error if more than one way in the cache has been hit. It operates on every positive edge of the input clock. By summing the data_hit_way array elements and checking if the sum is greater than 1, it identifies multiple cache hits and generates an error message when this occurs.
