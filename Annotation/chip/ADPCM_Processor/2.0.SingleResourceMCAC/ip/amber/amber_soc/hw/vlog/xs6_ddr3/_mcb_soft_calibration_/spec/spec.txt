Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), handling input termination calibration, broadcasting calibration values, and dynamic DQS delay calibration. It uses a state machine to sequence through calibration steps, adjusting termination values and DQS delays. Key inputs include UI_CLK (clock), RST (reset), PLL_LOCK, and various MCB signals. Outputs include DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL, SELFREFRESH signals, and numerous MCB control signals. Internal signals include STATE (current state), P_Term and N_Term (termination values), DQS_DELAY (current DQS delay), and various counters and flags. The module is divided into sections for input termination calibration, DQS delay calibration, and self-refresh handling. It implements complex calibration algorithms,
