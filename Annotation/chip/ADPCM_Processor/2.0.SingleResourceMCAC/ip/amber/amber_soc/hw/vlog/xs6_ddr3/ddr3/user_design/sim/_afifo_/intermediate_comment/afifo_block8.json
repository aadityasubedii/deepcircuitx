    "block_comment": "This block implements a read pointer logic in a FIFO buffer control for Verilog with synchronous reset and read strobe. Upon a positive edge on the read clock (rd_clk), if the reset (rst) is activated, both the read pointer (rd_ptr) and grey code representation (rd_gray) are set to zero with a delay of TCQ time units. Another case is when read strobe (rd_strobe) is active, indicating readiness to read, the read pointer is incremented. The read pointer value is also updated to rd_ptr_tmp, and for the grey code representation, it is updated to the value of rd_gray_nxt."
