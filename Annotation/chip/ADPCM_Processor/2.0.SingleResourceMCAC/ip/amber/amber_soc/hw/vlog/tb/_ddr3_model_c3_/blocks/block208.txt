The block of code triggers a DQS (Data Strobe) event receiver upon the rising edge of a DQS event. This is achieved by including an 'always' statement that reacts to the positive edge ('posedge') of the 'dqs_even[0]' signal. When this condition is met, the 'dqs_even_receiver(0)' function gets initiated, signifying the reception of a DQS event.
