    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for data strobe (DQS) signal edge detection. Specifically, it triggers a positive edge check function named 'dqs_pos_timing_check' whenever there is a rising edge on the 6th bit of the 'dqs_in' signal line. This functionality is achieved through the 'always @' construct which is a procedural block that reacts on every positive edge of the specified signal."
