Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: This module serves as a wrapper for a memory controller (MCB) interface, providing a high-level interface for multiple memory ports (p0 to p5) and AXI interfaces (s0 to s5). It handles various memory-related operations, including command processing, read/write operations, and calibration, supporting different memory types (e.g., DDR3) and configurations. The module has numerous input and output ports for clock signals, control signals, data inputs/outputs, and memory interface signals. Key inputs include clock signals (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), reset (async_rst), and various port-specific signals for commands, data, and control. Outputs include memory interface signals (mcbx_dram_*), status indicators, and data outputs. Internal signals are used for user output data, command readiness, refresh flags
