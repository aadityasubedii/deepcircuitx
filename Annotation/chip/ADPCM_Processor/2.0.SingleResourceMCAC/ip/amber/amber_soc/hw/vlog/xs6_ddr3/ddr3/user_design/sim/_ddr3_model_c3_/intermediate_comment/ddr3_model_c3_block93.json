    "block_comment": "This block of code triggers a check on the input array dq_in at index 37 every time it changes. Specifically, it uses an always @ block, which implies that the procedure dq_timing_check(37) will be activated at every change in the value of dq_in[37]. This is important for ensuring the timeliness and correctness of the array index's updated value."
