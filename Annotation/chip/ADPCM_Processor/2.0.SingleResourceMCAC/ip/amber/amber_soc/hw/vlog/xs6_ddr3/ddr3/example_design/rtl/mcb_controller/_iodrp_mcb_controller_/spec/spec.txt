Module name: iodrp_mcb_controller. 

Module specification: The module "iodrp_mcb_controller" is designed to control a DRP (Dynamic Reconfiguration Port) interface for reading from and writing to memory cells, facilitating dynamic reconfiguration of a system. Inputs to the module include eight-bit addresses and data for the memory cells, read/write controls, command validity, broadcast usage, DRP I/O interface address, reset, and DRP clock signals. The module outputs the read data from memory cell(s), a ready/busy signal, control (CS) and address phase (ADD) signals for DRP, backing store operation signal (DRP_BKST), serial data input (SDI) for DRP, and read signal (MCB_UIREAD) when the system is in the data phase. 

Internally, the module employs several signals, including those for holding current and next states of the finite state machine (FSM), memory cell address, read/write data, and control signals. A bit counter is used for bit counting during certain phases of the FSM. It also includes data-out signals used for processing and multiplexing data, DRP command start pre-control (DRP_CS_pre) and extra_CS signals, and an AddressPhase signal indicating the system phase, amongst others. 

The Verilog code comprises several blocks: nested always block for handling the states and transitions of the FSM, block for expanding and shifting data, block for dynamically adjusting data output based on I/O address, block for shifting input data into registers, and block for updating read_data and AddressPhase signals. These blocks collectively coordinate the DRP interface's operations, facilitating reliable and efficient dynamic reconfiguration.
