    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for loading the read control data 'load_rd_c'. If the signal 'i_wb_read_data_valid' is raised, specifying data has been successfully read then it takes the 5th and 6th digits along with the last four digits of 'i_wb_load_rd' and assigns it to 'load_rd_c' else it retains the previous value 'load_rd_r'. This is achieved using conditional operators in an assign statement, which enables immediate evaluation and assignment for easy debugging."
