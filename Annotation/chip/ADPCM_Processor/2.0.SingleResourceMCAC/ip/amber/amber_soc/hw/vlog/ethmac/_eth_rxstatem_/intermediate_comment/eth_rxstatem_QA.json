Its operations are based on the conditions identified by the input signals which are possibly from other modules. For examples, if the incoming data signal is not detected (`MRxDV`), the machine is set to the idle state; upon detecting a specific Ethernet preamble, it moves from idle to preamble state; upon detecting the Start Frame Delimiter (SFD), it shifts from preamble state to SFD state. Consequently, the receiver machine sequentially passes through data0 and data1 states and possibly the drop state. Each of these states are driven by the specific conditions monitored in the Ethernet receiving function. It signifies that this module is an essential part of managing and coordinating the reception of Ethernet frames."

It becomes high when there's no valid incoming data (`MRxDV` low) and any previous state was either drop, preamble, SFD or any data state.\n2. `StartPreamble`: A wire signal used to check for the conditions to transition into preamble state.

It gets high when valid data is available and the machine is in `Data0` state and not at maximum frame size.\n6. `StartDrop`: A wire signal used to check for the conditions to transition into drop state.

They get updated based on the input and start signals at every clock edge. The delay element `#Tp` ensures there is a delay before the update happens for proper synchronization.
