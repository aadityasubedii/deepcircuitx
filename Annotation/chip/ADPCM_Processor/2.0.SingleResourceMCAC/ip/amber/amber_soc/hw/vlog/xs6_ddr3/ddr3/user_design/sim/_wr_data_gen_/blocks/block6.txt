This block of Verilog RTL code manages the condition of the command ready signal (cmd_rdyE) based on various inputs transitions. The signal cmd_rdyE is set to 1 instantly after a rising edge of clk_i is detected and if reset signal (rst_i[0]) is high. The cmd_rdyE signal can also be set to 1 when cmd_startE signal is high. If the bl_i signal is 1, cmd_rdyE will stay enabled. If not, cmd_rdyE will be disabled. Additionally, cmd_rdyE is set to 1 if user_burst_cnt equals 2 and the FIFO is not full, hinting to the burst operation mode of a FIFO.
