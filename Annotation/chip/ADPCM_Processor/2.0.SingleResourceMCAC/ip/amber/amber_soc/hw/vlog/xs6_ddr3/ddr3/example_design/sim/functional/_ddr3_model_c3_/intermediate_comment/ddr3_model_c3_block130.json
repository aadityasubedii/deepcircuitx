    "block_comment": "This block is a hardware event trigger that perpetually monitors the first bit of the `dq_in` bus. Each time there's a change in `dq_in[0]`, it triggers the `dq_timing_check` function with `0` as its argument, which may be designed to perform sampling or integrity checks specifically on this bit of the input data."
