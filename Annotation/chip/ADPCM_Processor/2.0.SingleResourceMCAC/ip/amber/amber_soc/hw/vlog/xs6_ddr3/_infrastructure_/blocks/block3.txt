Comment: 
This block of code governs the generation of a reset signal (rst_tmp) in the system. It utilizes Bitwise OR and NOT operations on system reset (sys_rst) and inverted phase-locked loop locked signal (syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked) to assure that reset occurs either during system reset or when the PLL is not locked.
