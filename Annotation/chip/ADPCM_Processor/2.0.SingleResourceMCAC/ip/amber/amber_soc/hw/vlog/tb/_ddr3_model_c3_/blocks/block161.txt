This block of code is a procedural block that gets triggered by any change in the 4th bit of the `addr_in` vector. The purpose of this block is to execute the function `cmd_addr_timing_check` with the argument `10` whenever there is a change in the 4th bit of the `addr_in` data. This function is often used as a part of modules that handle memory-related instructions or address data processing, ensuring the integrity of timing protocols.
