    "block_comment": "This block couples the execution stage with the instruction fetch stage in a pipelined CPU design. It uses a positive edge-triggered flip-flop to do this: at each clock cycle, if there is no fetch-stage pipeline stall (`!i_fetch_stall`), the `execute_valid` signal is updated to reflect the validity of the current instruction (`i_instruction_valid`)."
