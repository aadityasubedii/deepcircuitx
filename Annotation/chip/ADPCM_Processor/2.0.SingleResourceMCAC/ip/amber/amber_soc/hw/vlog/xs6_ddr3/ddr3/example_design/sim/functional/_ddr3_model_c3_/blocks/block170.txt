This block is primarily used for triggering a command address timing verification functionality whenever there's a change with the 'ras_n_in' signal. Specifically, the 'always @' statement in Verilog initiates the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function with an argument of '1' each time the 'ras_n_in' signal toggles, ensuring the timing requirements for command address operations are continuously monitored and complied with.
