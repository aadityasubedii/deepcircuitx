    "block_comment": "This code block generates I/O buffers for DRAM data pins. It iterates over a certain set of data pins, defined by C_NUM_DQ_PINS, and for each pin, it creates an instance of an Input-Output Buffer (IOBUF) with input data, output enable, output, and bidirectional ports connected to specific arrays. IO module mcbx_dram_dq, ioi_dq, t_dq, and in_pre_dq reference the pin being iterated over, creating a unique buffer for each pin."
