    "block_comment": "This block implements I/O interface logic for a 16-bit DDR memory controller. It instantiates IODRP2_MCB (I/O Dynamic Reconfiguration Port) modules for each data (DQ), data strobe (DQS), and data mask (DM) signal. The IODRP2_MCB modules handle input/output, delay, and serialization/deserialization for the memory interface signals. The implementation uses a master-slave configuration for paired signals, with delay values and other parameters customized for each signal. The block also includes logic for chaining the auxiliary serial data between IODRP2_MCB instances."
