    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for synchronization of the RxEnSync signal. Based on rising edge detection in either the mrx_clk_pad_i or the wb_rst_i signals, it performs a reset of RxEnSync when a wb_rst_i signal is detected or updates RxEnSync based on the negation of the mrxdv_pad_i signal. The change to RxEnSync takes place after a propagation delay of '#Tp', ensuring synchronization of the signal with the system clock or an explicit reset."
