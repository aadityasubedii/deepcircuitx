Comment: 
This block of code triggers a process in Verilog known as `dq_timing_check()`, specifically for the 16th bit (index 15 as Verilog is 0-indexed) of the `dq_in` vector, whenever that bit undergoes a change. Details of the `dq_timing_check()` function implementation are not provided in this block, but it presumably performs some form of timing check (such as setup time check, hold time check, etc.) on the specific bit of the `dq_in` signal.
