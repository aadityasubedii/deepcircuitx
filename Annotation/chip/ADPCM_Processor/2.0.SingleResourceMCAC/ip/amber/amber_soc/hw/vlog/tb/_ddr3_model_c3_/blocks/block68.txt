Comment: 
This block of code is a procedural block that invokes the function "dq_timing_check" for the 62nd bit of the bit vector "dq_in" whenever this bit changes. This happens asynchronously with respect to any clocking events. The function dq_timing_check presumably checks the timing properties of the data being captured on this line, though the specifics of this function are not given in this block.
