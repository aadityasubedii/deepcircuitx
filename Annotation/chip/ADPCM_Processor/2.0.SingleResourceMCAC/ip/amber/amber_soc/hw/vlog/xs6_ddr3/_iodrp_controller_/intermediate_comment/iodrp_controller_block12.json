    "block_comment": "The block of code is used for state decoding in a Finite State Machine (FSM). It takes the current 'state' of the FSM and translates it into an ASCII string representation for clarity or for further processing. The state decoding is implemented through an always block sensitive to changes in the 'state' variable. Inside it, a case statement is used that equates each string representation ('state_ascii') to the equated 'state' of the FSM. This provides a way of easily identifying the current state of the FSM."
