    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns a value to the `instruction_execute` signal based on the result of the `conditional_execute` function. This function takes in two inputs: the present value stored in `condition_r` and the 4 most significant bits of the `i_execute_status_bits`. This implementation implies the function makes a decision on whether to execute the instruction or not based on certain condition codes stored in the 4 most significant bits of the `i_execute_status_bits`."
