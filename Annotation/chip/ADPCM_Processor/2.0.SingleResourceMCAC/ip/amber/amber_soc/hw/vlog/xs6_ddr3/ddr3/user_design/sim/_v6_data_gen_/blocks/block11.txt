The block of code handles the situation when the memory burst length is 8. It shifts the w1data register groups based on the number of DQ pins and assigns them with a delay defined by TCQ. Each group of data is divided into two equal halves - the earlier half determined by the last 5 bits from the next higher group, while the later half contains the first four bits of the original group ensuring sequential continuity. This cyclic shift pattern allows proper distribution of data during higher burst lengths.
