The block of code is designed for a display function during the initial run. This function displays the memory file that the boot process utilizes, known as "BOOT_MEM128_PARAMS_FILE". This is achieved by invoking a $display function call during the initial stage of the operation, where, for debugging purposes, it outputs the string of memory file being used, thus providing more transparency to the process.
