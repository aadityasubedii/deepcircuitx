Comment: 
The code block conditionally defines an assignment for the signal `cke_train`. It declares a conditional construct that checks the value of `C_MEM_TYPE` and if it is not equal to "DDR2", then it assigns the binary value '0' to the signal `cke_train`. The block of code is named `gen_cketrain_b` and its function is to disable (set as 0) the clock enable signal for memory types other than DDR2.
