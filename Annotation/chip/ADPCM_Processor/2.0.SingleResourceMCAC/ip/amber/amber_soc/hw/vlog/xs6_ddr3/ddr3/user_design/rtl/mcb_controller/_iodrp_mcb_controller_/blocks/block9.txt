Comment: 
This block of code essentially manages the functionality of the shift_through_reg register, based on the conditions of sync_rst and load_shift_n. Specifically, during the positive edge of the DRP_CLK, if the synchronous reset (sync_rst) is active, the shift_through_reg register is set to zero; otherwise, the block will load data_out_mux into the register if load_shift_n is high. If load_shift_n is not high, the register performs a shift operation by introducing the DRP_SDO into the second bit of the register from the left and shifting other bits right up to the 7th bit.
