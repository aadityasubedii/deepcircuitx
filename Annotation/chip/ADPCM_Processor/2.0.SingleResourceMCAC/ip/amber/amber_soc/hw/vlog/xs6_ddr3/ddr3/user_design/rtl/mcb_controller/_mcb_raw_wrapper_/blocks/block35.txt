Comment: 
[Function of the block]. This Verilog block manages a two-stage, pipelined delay mechanism, which signals when a 200 microseconds interval has passed, based on a provided clock signal and a pre-processed 15-bit countdown value (wait_200us_counter). 

[Implementation details of the block]. The block gets activated at each rising edge of the ui_clk clock signal. It checks the 14th and 13th bits of wait_200us_counter. If both are set (meaning the interval has passed), it sets the wait_200us_done_r1 to '1'. If not, it resets the same to '0'. The second line, wait_200us_done_r2, captures the value of wait_200us_done_r1 in the next clock cycle, implementing a one-cycle delay before this change becomes visible on wait_200us_done_r2.
