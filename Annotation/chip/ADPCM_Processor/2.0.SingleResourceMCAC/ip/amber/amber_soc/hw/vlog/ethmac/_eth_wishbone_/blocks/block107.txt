This block of Verilog code is primarily responsible for assigning certain portions of the `TxStatus` variable to other variables. More specifically, the 14th bit of `TxStatus` is assigned to `TxIRQEn`, the 13th bit to `WrapTxStatusBit`, the 12th bit to `PerPacketPad`, and the 11th bit to `PerPacketCrcEn`. Each of these assignments enable different functionalities, likely related to transmission settings, with the individual bits each controlling a different aspect.
