    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to ensure that the correct commands are sent to port 2 based on the port configuration settings. The block achieves this via a conditional check that happens whenever there's a change in the state of the program. Specifically, it checks if port 2 is configured for read-only operations (\"R32\"), the command enable for port 2 is activated (p2_cmd_en = 1), and the instruction set does not include write operations (p2_cmd_instr[2] = 0 and p2_cmd_instr[0] = 0). If these conditions are met, the block triggers an error message and terminates the program execution to prevent potential write operations on the read-only port."
