    "block_comment": "This code block manages the update of certain register values in a cache system on a rising clock edge (i_clk). If a cache flush operation (i_cache_flush) occurs, it resets the read buffer validity (read_buf_valid_r), setting it to zero. Otherwise, if the write-back is ready (i_wb_ready) and the cache state (c_state) is in fill phase 3 (CS_FILL3), the block updates the read buffer's data (read_buf_data_r) with new data from the write-back read data, updates the read buffer's address (read_buf_addr_r) with the miss_address and finally sets the read buffer valid bit (read_buf_valid_r) to 1, indicating valid data in the read buffer."
