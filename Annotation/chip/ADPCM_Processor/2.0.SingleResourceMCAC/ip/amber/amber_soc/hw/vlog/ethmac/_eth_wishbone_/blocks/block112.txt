This block handles the state changes of the TxEndFrm_wb signal in response to certain conditions. Whenever there is a rising edge on the WB_CLK_I or Reset, the block is triggered. If Reset is high, TxEndFrm_wb is reset to 0 with a delay of Tp. If the transmission length is 0, the buffer is nearly empty, and the used data is transmitted, then TxEndFrm_wb is set to 1, again with a delay of Tp. If there is a retry pulse, done pulse, or abort pulse, TxEndFrm_wb gets reset to 0, also with a delay of Tp. The approach of using the #Tp signifies the delay and the sensitivity list allows for an edge triggered design strategy.
