This block of code is a state register in a Finite State Machine (FSM) implemented in Verilog. It works by changing the current state of the FSM in each positive edge of the DRP_CLK. If the synchronous reset (sync_rst) is high during a clock edge, state is reset to 'READY', otherwise the state is updated to 'nextstate', which is assumed to be calculated in another part of the code based on the current state and inputs.
