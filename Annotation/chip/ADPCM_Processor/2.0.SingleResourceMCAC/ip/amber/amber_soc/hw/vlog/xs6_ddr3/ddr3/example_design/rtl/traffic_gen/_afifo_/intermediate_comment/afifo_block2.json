    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for managing a memory buffer's write access. The \"full\" signal indicates whether the buffer is full or not. Upon every rising edge of the write clock (wr_clk), this block checks whether the reset (rst) signal is high. If it is, it sets the full signal to 0 (indicating the buffer is not full). If the reset signal is not high, it checks the buffer availability (buf_avail). If the buffer is unavailable or if write enable (wr_en) signal is high when there's only one slot left in the buffer, it sets the full signal to 1 (indicating the buffer is full). In any other case, it maintains the full signal as 0."
