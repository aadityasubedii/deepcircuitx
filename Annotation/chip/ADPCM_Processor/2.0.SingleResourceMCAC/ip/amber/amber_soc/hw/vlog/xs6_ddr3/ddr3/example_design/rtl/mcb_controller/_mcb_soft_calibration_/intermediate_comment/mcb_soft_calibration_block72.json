    "block_comment": "This block of code serves to manage the self-refresh mode and request and the lock situation of the PLL. At the positive edge of the UI Clock or upon a reset, the Verilog code block assigns initial zeros to the self-refresh mode (MCB), self-refresh request and PLL lock for phases one to three if a reset signal is asserted. If the reset signal is not asserted, the block propagates the current states of these variables into their delayed versions (R1, R2, R3), effectively creating a three-stage shift register pipeline."
