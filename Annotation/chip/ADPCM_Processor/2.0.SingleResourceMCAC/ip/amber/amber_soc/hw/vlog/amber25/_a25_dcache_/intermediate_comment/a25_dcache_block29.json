    "block_comment": "The provided block of Verilog code is designed for cache data hit detection in a specific way. It does this by assigning a Boolean value to the signal `data_hit_way[i]`. The value becomes true if and only if all the following conditions are satisfied: the most significant bit of `tag_rdata_way[i]` is ON, the lower address bits of `tag_rdata_way[i]` match with the specific bits of `i_address` and if the cache state (`c_state`) currently is in the idle (CS_IDLE) state."
