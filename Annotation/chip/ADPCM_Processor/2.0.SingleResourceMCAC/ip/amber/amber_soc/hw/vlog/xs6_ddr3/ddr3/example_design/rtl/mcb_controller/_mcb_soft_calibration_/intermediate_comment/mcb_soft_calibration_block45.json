    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a state machine waiting for a start command to broadcast in a memory controller board (MCB) system. To start with, variables `Pre_SYSRST` is cleared and `Active_IODRP` is set to the MCB port status. Once the start broadcast signal is received (`START_BROADCAST`) and the I/O read port control register is ready (`IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N`), the block scans for changes in the P-terminal and N-terminal resistance values (`P_Term` and `N_Term`). If there's a change in `P_Term` or a skip in terminal calibration (`SKIP_IN_TERM_CAL`), it moves to the `BROADCAST_PTERM` state while updating `P_Term_Prev`. If there's a change in `N_Term`, it updates `N_Term_Prev` and moves to `BROADCAST_NTERM` state. If no changes are found, it moves to the `OFF_RZQ_PTERM` state. If the start broadcast hasn't been received, it remains in the `WAIT_FOR_START_BROADCAST` state."
