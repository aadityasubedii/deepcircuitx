    "spec": "Module name: sim_tb_top. \n\nModule specification: The \"sim_tb_top\" module serves as a top-level simulation testbench for a DDR3 memory model, aimed at verifying the calibration and error handling of the memory interface signals. Being a testbench, it does not utilize any input or output ports, but generates all necessary signals internally and communicates with the module \"example_top\" (Design Under Test) using inter-module connections. \n\nInternal signals include the system clock (c3_sys_clk), system reset (c3_sys_rst, c3_sys_rst_i), DRAM interface signals like mcb3_dram_a, mcb3_dram_ba, mcb3_dram_ck, mcb3_dram_ck_n, mcb3_dram_dq, mcb3_dram_dqs, mcb3_dram_dqs_n, mcb3_dram_dm, mcb3_dram_ras_n, mcb3_dram_cas_n, mcb3_dram_we_n, mcb3_dram_cke, mcb3_dram_odt, mcb3_dram_reset_n, mcb3_dram_udqs, mcb3_dram_udqs_n, mcb3_dram_udm, and signals for calibration and error indication (calib_done, error), and impedance representation signal (rzq3). \n\nThe module is mainly structured into multiple sections that handle different tasks. It begins with the declaration and initialization of parameters and signals. Then, it generates system clock and system reset signals, resets the system initially, and provides the inverted reset signal based on the parameter C3_RST_ACT_LOW. Following this, there is the instantiation of the \u201cexample_top\u201d module with appropriate parameterization and connection of signals. The module also creates instances of 'ddr3_model_c3' depending upon the parameter C3_NUM_DQ_PINS. Lastly, it monitors the status of calibration and error signals. If the calibration finished successfully without any errors, it displays the message \"TEST PASSED\". If an error is detected, or if the calibration did not complete, the module reports a \"TEST FAILED\" message, specifying the cause of failure.",

Key parameters and architectural choices of the simulated DDR3 memory are defined in this module, such as address width, clock period, memory bank address width, and the number of DQ pins.

Instead, all necessary signals are generated within the module.\n\nOutput ports: None\nExplanation: Similarly, as a top-level testbench, it does not have output ports as it's not supposed to provide any signals to another module. The purpose of this module is to simulate and evaluate the behavior of the design under test, which in this case is the \"example_top\" module.

Instead, all necessary signals are generated within the module.\n\nOutput ports: None\nExplanation: Similarly, as a top-level testbench, it does not have output ports as it's not supposed to provide any signals to another module. The purpose of this module is to simulate and evaluate the behavior of the design under test, which in this case is the \"example_top\" module. The results are displayed via the $display system task rather than through an output port. \n\nInter-module wires: c3_sys_clk, c3_sys_rst_i, and different wires connected to the \u201cexample_top\u201d instance such as mcb3_dram_dq, mcb3_dram_a, mcb3_dram_ba, mcb3_dram_ras_n, mcb3_dram_cas_n, mcb3_dram_we_n, mcb3_dram_odt, mcb3_dram_cke, mcb3_dram_ck, mcb3_dram_ck_n, mcb3_dram_dqs, mcb3_dram_dqs_n, calib_done, error, mcb3_dram_udqs, mcb3_dram_udqs_n, mcb3_dram_udm, mcb3_dram_dm, mcb3_rzq, mcb3_dram_reset_n;\nExplanation: These are not actual input or output ports of the \u201csim_tb_top\u201d module but are signals that are used to interconnect the \u201csim_tb_top\u201d module with the \u201cexample_top\u201d module. The \u201csim_tb_top\u201d module generates and drives these signals to stimulate the DUT (Design Under Test) which is the \u201cexample_top\u201d.

Being a testbench, it does not utilize any input or output ports, but generates all necessary signals internally and communicates with the module \"example_top\" (Design Under Test) using inter-module connections. \n\nInternal signals include the system clock (c3_sys_clk), system reset (c3_sys_rst, c3_sys_rst_i), DRAM interface signals like mcb3_dram_a, mcb3_dram_ba, mcb3_dram_ck, mcb3_dram_ck_n, mcb3_dram_dq, mcb3_dram_dqs, mcb3_dram_dqs_n, mcb3_dram_dm, mcb3_dram_ras_n, mcb3_dram_cas_n, mcb3_dram_we_n, mcb3_dram_cke, mcb3_dram_odt, mcb3_dram_reset_n, mcb3_dram_udqs, mcb3_dram_udqs_n, mcb3_dram_udm, and signals for calibration and error indication (calib_done, error), and impedance representation signal (rzq3). \n\nThe module is mainly structured into multiple sections that handle different tasks. It begins with the declaration and initialization of parameters and signals. Then, it generates system clock and system reset signals, resets the system initially, and provides the inverted reset signal based on the parameter C3_RST_ACT_LOW. Following this, there is the instantiation of the \u201cexample_top\u201d module with appropriate parameterization and connection of signals. The module also creates instances of 'ddr3_model_c3' depending upon the parameter C3_NUM_DQ_PINS. Lastly, it monitors the status of calibration and error signals. If the calibration finished successfully without any errors, it displays the message \"TEST PASSED\". If an error is detected, or if the calibration did not complete, the module reports a \"TEST FAILED\" message, specifying the cause of failure."
