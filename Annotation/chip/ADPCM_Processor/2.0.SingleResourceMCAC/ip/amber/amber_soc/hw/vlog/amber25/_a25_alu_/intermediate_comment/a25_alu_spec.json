    "spec": "Module name: a25_alu\n\nModule specification: The 'a25_alu' module is an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for an A25 series chip that performs various arithmetic and bitwise operations on 32-bit inputs i_a_in and i_b_in based on the 9-bit function code input i_function. Inputs also include i_barrel_shift_carry and i_status_bits_carry for carry status in operations. Output o_out illustrates the 32-bit result of the operation, whereas o_flags carries flags related to sign, zero result, carry out, and overflow of the operation's result. \n\nInternally, this module has several signals, like a and b representing inputs after a swap operation as deemed by i_function, and b_not representing the bitwise NOT operation on b according to i_function. It further contains signals for the results of bitwise AND, OR, XOR operations as well as sign and zero extended results from b_not. Signals are also dedicated for carry in & out and overflow, sourced according to i_function using cin_sel and cout_sel. \n\nThe module follows a series of logic and arithmetic operations as it works, starting from swapping and NOT operations on inputs, deciding carry in and out, performing arithmetic (using appropriate FPGA hardware when available), and bitwise operations, extending results, up to the point where it determines the output based on i_function, and generates the result along with flags for sign, zero result, carry out and overflow. \n\nThis module is well-structured and meticulously architected to provide the necessary ALU operations for A25 chip, making the 'a25_alu' integral for arithmetic and logic functions.",

It receives input operands and function codes, performing various bitwise, arithmetic, and logical operations on the inputs according to the function code selected. The module computes addition and subtraction and performs a wide range of bit operations (AND, OR, XOR) and manipulations such as zero and sign extension. It handles carry in and carry out scenarios and also detects overflow conditions as part of its operation. It is designed to work with both Xilinx Spartan6 and Virtex6 FPGA architectures along with the general-purpose implementation, switching to a specific implementation depending on the `ifdefs. The output, along with flags signifying resultant sign, zero, carry out and overflow conditions, is then produced."

Inputs also include i_barrel_shift_carry and i_status_bits_carry for carry status in operations. Output o_out illustrates the 32-bit result of the operation, whereas o_flags carries flags related to sign, zero result, carry out, and overflow of the operation's result. \n\nInternally, this module has several signals, like a and b representing inputs after a swap operation as deemed by i_function, and b_not representing the bitwise NOT operation on b according to i_function. It further contains signals for the results of bitwise AND, OR, XOR operations as well as sign and zero extended results from b_not. Signals are also dedicated for carry in & out and overflow, sourced according to i_function using cin_sel and cout_sel. \n\nThe module follows a series of logic and arithmetic operations as it works, starting from swapping and NOT operations on inputs, deciding carry in and out, performing arithmetic (using appropriate FPGA hardware when available), and bitwise operations, extending results, up to the point where it determines the output based on i_function, and generates the result along with flags for sign, zero result, carry out and overflow. \n\nThis module is well-structured and meticulously architected to provide the necessary ALU operations for A25 chip, making the 'a25_alu' integral for arithmetic and logic functions."
