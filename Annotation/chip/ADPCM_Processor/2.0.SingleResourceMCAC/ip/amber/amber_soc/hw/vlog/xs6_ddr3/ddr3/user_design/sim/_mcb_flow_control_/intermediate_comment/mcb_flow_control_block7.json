    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the command registration process on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the push command is active, it captures the input commands ('cmd_i'), input address ('addr_i') and the burst length ('bl_i' - 1) in respective registers with a delay defined by '#TCQ'. The delay could be to synchronize with the clock or to emulate memory access timings."
