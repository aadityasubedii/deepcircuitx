    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code initializes two strings in the 'dqs_string' array. In the initial block, two strings \"DQS  \" and \"DQS_N\" are assigned to the 'dqs_string' array at indices 0 and 1 respectively. The purpose is typically to prepare for further use of these values in the rest of the code, which can refer to these initialized elements of the 'dqs_string' array.\n"
