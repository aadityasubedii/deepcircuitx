Comment: 
The block is a part of a larger system that handles transmission data and its state and is mainly responsible for managing the pulse count and pulse status of the transmitted bits. Specifically, if the bit pulse count matches certain transmission conditions and the transmission state is not in its second stop phase, it resets the bit pulse count and sets the bit pulse to 1; in other cases, it increments the bit pulse count and sets the bit pulse to 0. This regulation of bit pulse and count control is crucial to maintain the integrity of the transmission data. Moonlighting on the clock edge ensures the synchronous working of the system.
