    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily functions as a conditional data pattern generator with a data width of 128 (DWIDTH). It operates by checking if DWIDTH is set to 128 and if the DATA_PATTERN is set to either \"DGEN_WALKING0\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", or \"DGEN_ALL\". In the event that both conditions are fulfilled, the labeled block, WALKING_ONE_128_PATTERN, is executed."
