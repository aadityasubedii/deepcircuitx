    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a state machine that generates a force write command (force_wrcmd_gen) signal based on a set of conditions. The signal force_wrcmd_gen is reset to 0 at a positive edge of clock (clk_i) if the lowest bit of reset input (rst_i[0]) is high, or if another set of conditions like the end of a burst length (wait_bl_end toggling from high to low) is met, or a timeout scenario is encountered where force_wrcmd_timeout_cnts reaches its maximum value. Force_wrcmd_gen is set to 1 when the input command is valid and the burst length is greater than 16, or if it's waiting for a burst length to end. This code runs at every positive edge of the input clock, which means it updates force_wrcmd_gen concurrently with the update rate of clk_i."
