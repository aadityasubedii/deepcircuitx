This block of Verilog code conditionally generates a pattern based on the number of data query (DQ) pins and the specified data pattern. If the number of DQ pins is 96 and the data pattern is either "DGEN_NEIGHBOR", "DGEN_WALKING1", "DGEN_WALKING0", or "DGEN_ALL", then a walking pattern is generated and triggered at the positive edge of the input clock (clk_i).
