    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a value to `void_output` based on the logical combination of certain conditions. Specifically, `void_output` becomes true if `fetch_only_stall_r` and `fetch_only_stall` are both true, or if `fetch_only_stall_r` and `mem_read_data_valid_r` are both true. This implies that `void_output` signifies a situation where either a stall is happening in the fetch-only process, or the fetch-only process is stalled and memory read data is valid."
