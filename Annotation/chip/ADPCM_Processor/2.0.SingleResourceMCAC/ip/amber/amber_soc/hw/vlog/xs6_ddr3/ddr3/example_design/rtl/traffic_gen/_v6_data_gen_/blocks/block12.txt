The block is designed to generate data in a write-first mode based on different inputs and modes. On every positive edge of the given clock, it checks if the channel is ready or if there is a start signal. If so, it looks up the memory location indicated by the input address and the current data mode. Depending on the value of 6 MSB bits of input address and the data mode, it selects the appropriate data generating function and assigns the generated data to w1data. If none of the cases are matched then it assigns Zero to the w1data.
