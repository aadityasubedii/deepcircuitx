Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used to conditionally generate a block tagged as data_out128 when the data width (DWIDTH) equals 128. This conditional block generation is performed at elaboration time. The code inside this tagged block (not shown here) would typically be specialized for handling a 128-bit data path, allowing the design to be configurable based on the data width parameter DWIDTH. The construct allows flexibility for handling data paths of different widths in a efficient manner.
