    "block_comment": "The block of code enables a command only when two conditions are met. An AND logic operation is applied on the read form of the command enable (cmd_en_r) and the inverse of the command full input (i_cmd_full). If both cmd_en_r is true and i_cmd_full is false (not full), the output command enable (o_cmd_en) is activated, hence allowing the execution of a command."
