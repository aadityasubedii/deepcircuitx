This block of code manages the asynchronous reset or synchronous update of the 'SetTxCIrq' register based on the conditions of 'Reset', 'SetTxCIrq_sync2' and 'SetTxCIrq_sync3'. On a positive edge of 'Reset', the 'SetTxCIrq' register is reset to '0'. However, on a positive clock edge 'Clk', when 'Reset' is not asserted, it assigns the AND operation of 'SetTxCIrq_sync2' and the negation of 'SetTxCIrq_sync3' to 'SetTxCIrq', giving 'SetTxCIrq_sync3' priority to 'SetTxCIrq_sync2' if both are active at the same time.
