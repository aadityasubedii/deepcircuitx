    "block_comment": "The block of code performs an initial display operation on system boot. It displays a message, specifically, the memory file boot path, with a predefined macro 'BOOT_MEM32_PARAMS_FILE'. This initial statement is executed at simulation time 0 and will not be re-executed again, making it ideal for specific debug information or for operations that should be executed only once."
