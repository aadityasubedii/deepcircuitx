Comment: 
The given Verilog code block is used for data_out multiplexing based on the drp_ioi_addr. Various signals are considered, like IOI_DQ[0-15], IOI_UDQS_CLK, IOI_UDQS_PIN, IOI_LDQS_CLK, and IOI_LDQS_PIN and they are selectively assigned to data_out_mux keeping in view the DRP_v1_0_FIX directive. If the DRP_v1_0_FIX directive is defined, results take into consideration bit shifting operations for certain addresses; otherwise, data_out_mux gets directly assigned the value of data_out.
