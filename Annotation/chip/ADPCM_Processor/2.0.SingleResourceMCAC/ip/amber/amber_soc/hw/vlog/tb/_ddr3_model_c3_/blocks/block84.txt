This block of code is designed to trigger a function named `dq_timing_check` whenever there is a change detected at the 47th bit (considering bit-index starts from 0) of a signal `dq_in`. Specifically, using `always @` keyphrase setup an event-driven behavior that will call and pass the number 46 to `dq_timing_check` function only when there's an edge change (either positive or negative) on this particular bit of `dq_in` data bus.
