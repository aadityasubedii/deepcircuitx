    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages a write buffer usage counter. Synchronized to the positive edge of a clock signal, the block checks for simultaneous push and pop operations, maintaining the counter value in such cases. If there's only a push operation, it increments the counter, and if there's only a pop operation, it decrements the counter."
