This block of code is responsible for controlling the "normal_operation_window" signal in response to various system flags. On a positive edge of the clock, if the system reset is active, "normal_operation_window" is set high. When the system is entering or is in self-refresh mode, "normal_operation_window" is set low. If the system is neither entering nor in self-refresh mode, "normal_operation_window" signal is set high. If none of these conditions are met, the "normal_operation_window" retains its current value.
