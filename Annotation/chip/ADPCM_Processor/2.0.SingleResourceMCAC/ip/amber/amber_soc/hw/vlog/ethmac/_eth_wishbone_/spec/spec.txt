Module name: eth_wishbone. Module specification: The eth_wishbone module serves as a Wishbone interface for an Ethernet controller, managing communication between the Ethernet MAC and the Wishbone bus for both transmit and receive operations. It handles transmit and receive buffer descriptors, controls data flow, manages interrupts for Ethernet events, implements FIFO buffers, and synchronizes signals between clock domains. The module's key inputs include Wishbone bus signals (WB_CLK_I, WB_DAT_I, WB_ADR_I, WB_WE_I), Ethernet MAC interface signals (MTxClk, MRxClk, TxData, RxData), and various control and status signals. Outputs include Wishbone bus response signals (WB_DAT_O, WB_ACK_O), Ethernet frame control signals (TxStartF
