Module name: xs6_sram_256x21_line_en. 

Module specification: The 'xs6_sram_256x21_line_en' module implements a Xilinx's 6 input Synchronous Random Access Memory (SRAM) with a size of 256x21. It has parameters such as DATA_WIDTH, ADDRESS_WIDTH, and INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO to determine the specifications of the memory. The module uses a single dual-port Block RAM for read-write operations.

The input ports include 'i_clk' to provide a clock signal, 'i_write_data' to accept 21-bit wide data for writing into the memory, 'i_write_enable' to control the write operation, and 'i_address' to pass the address for data to be accessed in memory. The output port 'o_read_data' outputs the 21-bit wide data read from the memory.

Internally, the module uses signals 'read_data_lo' and 'read_data_hi' to hold portions of the data read from Block RAM. These signals are patched together to form the output data read from memory. An initial block is used to ensure that the DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH parameters are correctly set to 21 and 8 respectively, and displays a warning message if these values are not as expected. 

This module uses a RAMB8BWER instance that is configured with the correct parameters and connected to the required I/O signals. Reading and writing operations are performed synchronously with the rising edge of the clock signal.                                  
This module serves as a memory of size 256 rows of 21 bits wide data, providing fundamental read and write operations.
