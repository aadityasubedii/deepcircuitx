    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates a timing check function on the 10th bit of the 'dq_in' bit-vector whenever there is a change in its value. The 'always @' syntax specifies that whenever there is event change, or in this case, a value change in the 10th bit of 'dq_in' bit-vector, the 'dq_timing_check' function is triggered for this specific bit. The function 'dq_timing_check' possibly checks for any timing violations related to the 10th bit of the 'dq_in' bit-vector."
