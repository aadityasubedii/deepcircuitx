    "block_comment": "This block of verilog code serves as a conditional flag activator for an 'ex_read_hit'. Basically, it is used to detect read hits in an exclusive access environment. Implementation-wise, the block is straightforward with an assigned statement based on logical and bitwise operations. The ex_read_hit flag is activated if the system is in an exclusive access state, the write_enable signal is inactive, and there is an idle 'hit' captured i.e. ('exclusive_access' AND (NOT 'i_write_enable') AND 'idle_hit')."
