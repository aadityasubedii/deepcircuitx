Comment: 
This block of code controls the WAIT_SELFREFRESH_EXIT_DQS_CAL signal which is related to the Dynamic Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (DQS) calibration process in a system, possibly a memory controller. It operates on the rising edge of the User Interface clock (UI_CLK). If a reset condition (RST) is detected, the DQS calibration process is not ready yet, setting the signal to '0'. If not in self-refresh mode (SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE_R3) but was in the previous cycle (SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE_R2), the DQS calibration process is ready to start, setting the signal to '1'. However, if the DQS calibration process is already waiting and no longer in self-refresh mode and a dynamic calibration is required after self-refresh (PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH), the process is not ready anymore, setting the signal back to '0'.
