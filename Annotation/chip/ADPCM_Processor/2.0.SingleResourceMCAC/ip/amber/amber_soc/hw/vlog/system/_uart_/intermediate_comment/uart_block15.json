    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to detect the start condition in a serial communication. It checks if the 4th and 3rd bits (`rxd_d[4:3]`) of the data received (`rxd_d`) are '11' and the 1st and 0th bits (`rxd_d[1:0]`) are '00'. If this condition matches, it signifies the start of transmission, and the 'rx_start' signal is asserted. This is implemented using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog, which continuously checks the given condition."
