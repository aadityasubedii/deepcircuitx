The block is in a wait state for the memory controller block ready (MCB_RDY_BUSY_N) signal. While in the UDQS_WAIT2 state, if the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal is not received, the state remains in UDQS_WAIT2. If it receives the signal, it initializes DQS_DELAY and TARGET_DQS_DELAY with DQS_DELAY_INITIAL values, and transitions to the START_DYN_CAL state.
