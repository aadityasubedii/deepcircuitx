This block of code calls the function `dq_timing_check` whenever there is a change at index 61 of the `dq_in` array. Using the `always @` construct, the implementation sets up a sensitivity list, and thus the function `dq_timing_check(61)` is invoked whenever the value at index 61 of `dq_in` experiences a change.
