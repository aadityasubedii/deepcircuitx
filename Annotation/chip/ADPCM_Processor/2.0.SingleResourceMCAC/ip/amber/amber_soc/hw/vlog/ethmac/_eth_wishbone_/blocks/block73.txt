This block is designed to synchronize the signal `ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb3` from a slower domain to a faster MTxClk domain. It essentially prevents metastability in digital circuits that are part of asynchronous design or multi-clock design. It leverages a D Flip-Flop setup - captured at the rising edge of 'MTxClk' or 'Reset' signals. When the 'reset' signal is set, 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb3' is immediately set to zero. Otherwise, the block waits for a propagation delay of '#Tp', before assigning the second synchronizing flip flop, 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb2', to 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb3'. The propagation delay '#Tp' is critical in ensuring proper synchronization.
