    "block_comment": "The block of code generates a reset signal (non_violating_rst) when the reset condition (Rst_condition1) is true. The implementation uses an 'and' operation ('&') to ensure that the reset signal is only issued when both the reset (RST) and reset condition 1 are true. If either of these are not met, the reset signal will not go through."
