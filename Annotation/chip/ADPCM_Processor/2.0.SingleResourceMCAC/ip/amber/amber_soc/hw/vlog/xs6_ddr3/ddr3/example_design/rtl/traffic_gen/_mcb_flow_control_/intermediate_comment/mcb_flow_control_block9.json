    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the behavior of the 'wait_done' signal in a synchronous digital system. On every positive edge of the clock signal (clk_i), it checks the status of a reset signal (rst_i[8]), a push command signal (push_cmd_r), and a set of conditions relating to command readiness (cmd_rdy_o), command validity (cmd_valid_i) and the specific hardware family (FAMILY == \"SPARTAN6\"). If the reset signal or the push command is high, 'wait_done' signal is set to one after a certain delay (#TCQ). Meanwhile, if the conditions of command readiness, command validity, and specific hardware family are all met, 'wait_done' is set to zero, after the same delay.\n"
