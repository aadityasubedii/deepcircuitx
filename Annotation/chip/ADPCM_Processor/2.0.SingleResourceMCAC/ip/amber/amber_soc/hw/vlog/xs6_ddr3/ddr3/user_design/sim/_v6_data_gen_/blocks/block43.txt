The block of code is a conditional code generator specifically for a certain type of data patterns when the number of DQ pins is 56. It operates based on the rising edge of the input clock. The exercising patterns are "DGEN_NEIGHBOR", "DGEN_WALKING1", "DGEN_WALKING0" and "DGEN_ALL". When any of these data patterns are selected with 56 DQ pins, this block gets activated.
