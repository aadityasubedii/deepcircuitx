    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a timing check on the 12th bit (index 11) of the input data queue, `dq_in`. The check is triggered whenever there's a change in the data on the 12th bit, using edge-triggered sensitivity, as indicated by the `always @` statement. It achieves this functionality by calling the `dq_timing_check` function with `11` as the argument, referencing the bit of interest."
