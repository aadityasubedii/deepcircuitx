This block acts as a control block for the ready state of a Command FIFO in a digital design system. Upon a positive edge of the input clock, it checks the reset signal's 10th bit. If it's high, it sets the Command FIFO ready state to ready instantly. If the xfer_cmd command is high, it sets the Command FIFO to not ready. If none of these conditions are met, then it checks if the memory control block command is not full. If it's not full, the Command FIFO is set to ready again.
