    "block_comment": "This block of code is monitoring the signal at index 44 of the dq_in array in every single moment and calling the function dq_timing_check with an argument of 44 whenever there is a change in its value. The 'always' keyword means the process is perpetually ready to respond to changes in the mentioned signal. The function dq_timing_check is presumably designed to validate/diagnose timing of the specific dq_in signal segment being monitored."
