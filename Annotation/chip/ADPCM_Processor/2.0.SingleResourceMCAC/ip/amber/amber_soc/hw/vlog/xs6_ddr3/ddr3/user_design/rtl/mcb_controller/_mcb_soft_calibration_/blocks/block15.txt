Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is primarily responsible for implementing self-refresh and phase-locked loop (PLL) functionalities on positive edge of user interface clock or on reset. Upon receiving RST (reset) signal, the block disables 'Self-Refresh' and 'PLL Lock' by resetting three consecutive 'SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE', 'SELFREFRESH_REQ', and 'PLL_LOCK' flip-flops. In the absence of a reset signal, however, the block maintains a rolling history for these functionalities by updating their respective flip-flops with values from preceding cycle. This process ensures the cascading nature of these features, allowing the hardware to carry a brief history of states.
