It can issue different types of commands (like read, write, refresh) to memory, while maintaining a command queue to have optimal usage of memory operation cycles. It can handle situations when the command queue is full or there is a request for different types of operations. It uses a finite state machine (FSM) to handle different conditions and transitions for issuing commands to the memory controller. Additionally, the module output pins help in giving address and commands signals to the memory and other control signals like ready, valid, etc. to other modules interfacing with it."
