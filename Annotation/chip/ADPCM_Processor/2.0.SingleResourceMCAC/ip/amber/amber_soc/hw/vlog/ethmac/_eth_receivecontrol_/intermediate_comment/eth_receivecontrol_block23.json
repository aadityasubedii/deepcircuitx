    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is essentially performing an address verification check. It sequentially checks every byte of received data (RxData) and compares it with reserved multicast destination and the predefined MAC address in their respective order. If the byte matches either the reserved multicast or MAC address, a flag, AddressOK, is set high, only if the existing flag is high. This ensures not only the present byte but all past bytes have matched. If the received data does not match or a reset or a receive end condition is encountered, the flag, AddressOK, is reset low. The code works on the edge of a clock signal or a reset signal."
