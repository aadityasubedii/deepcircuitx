    "block_comment": "This block of code acts as a system control unit for user burst counter operations, dependent on an incoming clock signal. The code block resets the user burst counter when a system reset signal is detected. If a command start is received, it checks the bl_i input signal and sets the user burst counter accordingly. If bl_i is zero, the counter is set to a constant value, otherwise, it is set to the value of bl_i. If system FIFO is ready and user burst counter is not zero, the burst counter is decremented, else it is reset to zero."
