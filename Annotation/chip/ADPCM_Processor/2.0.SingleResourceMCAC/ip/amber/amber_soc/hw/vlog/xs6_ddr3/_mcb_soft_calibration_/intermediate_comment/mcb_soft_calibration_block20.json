    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code appears to manage the process of writing program termination (P_Term) data onto the UDQS_PIN. It employs a finite state machine to control the process. It begins by setting the IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA to P_Term_s and MCB_UIADDR to IOI_UDQS_PIN, then it designates MCB_CMD_VALID to 1. The subsequent state transitions depend on the status of MCB_RDY_BUSY_N. If MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is true, it will transition into \"UDQS_PIN_WRITE_P_TERM\" state. Otherwise, it will transition into \"UDQS_PIN_P_TERM_WAIT\" state. After that, if MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is not busy, the state will remain in \"UDQS_PIN_P_TERM_WAIT\". Once the MCB is no longer busy, it moves to the \"UDQS_PIN_WRITE_N_TERM\" state."
