    "block_comment": "This block of code operates as an instruction decoder for different modes of operation in a system, utilizing sequential logic and examining the instruction mode input. On every positive edge of the clock signal, it examines the `instr_mode_i` signal. Dependent on the value of the `instr_mode_i`, it assigns different values to the `instr_out` output signal, which carries out a delay defined by the `TCQ` constant. Case values from `0` to `5` decode different instructions based on system input signals, which include `bram_instr_i`, `fixed_instr_i`, `prbs_instr_a`, `prbs_instr_b`, and `refresh_prbs`. The `default` case assigns a default value to `instr_out` when the `instr_mode_i` does not match any defined cases."
