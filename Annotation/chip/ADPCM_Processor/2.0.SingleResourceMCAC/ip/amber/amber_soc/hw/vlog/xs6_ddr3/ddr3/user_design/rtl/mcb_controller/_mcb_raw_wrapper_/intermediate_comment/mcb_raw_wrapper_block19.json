    "block_comment": "This block functions as an instantiation of a 2-bit output serial data stream (OSERDES) module with its parameters explicitly defined. The module is implemented with the bypass GCLK FF option activated, specified data rates for output data/clocking, the output mode set to single-ended, and the SerDes mode set to master. Among its multiple connections, 'udm_oq' and 'udm_t' manage output data and tri-state control respectively. The clock source 'ioclk90' is used, and the module is reset via 'int_sys_rst'. Notably, only the first two data inputs 'dqpum' and 'dqnum' and tri-state control inputs 'dqIO_w_en_0' are used, with the remaining explicitly set to zero."
