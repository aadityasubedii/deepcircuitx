    "block_comment": "This block of code essentially functions to listen for and respond to a positive edge trigger of `dqs_even[ 4]`. Upon identifying such an event, the block calls `dqs_even_receiver( 4)` function to further respond to the triggered event. The block accomplishes its intended function using the `always` keyword in Verilog which facilitates the continuous monitoring of the `dqs_even[ 4]` signal and triggers the corresponding action whenever a positive edge is detected."
