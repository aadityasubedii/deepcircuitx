It manages the reading and writing statuses, address and data phase transitions, and other timing essential for communication between the system and the memory. Important signals such as 'rd_not_write', 'memcell_address', 'write_data' etc., show that the module handles both read and write operations to the memory. It also features a Finite State Machine (FSM) with states like 'READY', 'DECIDE', 'ADDR_PHASE', 'DATA_PHASE', etc., controlling and sequencing the operations. The module uses tasks, such as shift_n_expand to perform specific operations related to data processing, and interacts with DRP with signals like 'DRP_SDI', 'DRP_SDO', 'DRP_CLK', etc.\n"
