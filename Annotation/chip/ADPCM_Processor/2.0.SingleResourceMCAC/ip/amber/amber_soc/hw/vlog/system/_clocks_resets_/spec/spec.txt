Module name: `clocks_resets`. 

Module specification: The `clocks_resets` module is specifically designed for the management of clocks and resets in an FPGA based system. The input ports of this module are the board reset (`i_brd_rst`), the board clock negative (`i_brd_clk_n`),  board clock positive (`i_brd_clk_p`), and DDR calibration done signal (`i_ddr_calib_done`). These inputs play crucial roles in managing the system's power initiation process and synchronizing the system's operation with the underlying hardware clock infrastructure. Conversely, the output ports are the system reset (`o_sys_rst`), system clock (`o_sys_clk`) and a specialized 200 MHz clock (`o_clk_200`). These outputs direct the system's operational pace synchronously with other peripheral hardwares. The module utilizes several internal signals like `calib_done_33mhz`, `rst0`, `pll_locked`, `clkfbout_clkfbin`, `rst0_sync_r`, `ddr_calib_done_sync_r`, `rst_tmp`, `pll_clk`, `brd_clk_ibufg`, that are indispensable for providing a synchronization mechanism, managing clock signals, handling the phase-locked loop state, and facilitating accurate signal propagation within the module. This module contains various sections that handle clock generation, signal synchronization, and system resets. The way these sections work depends on the type of FPGA in use (XILINX SPARTAN6 FPGA, XILINX VIRTEX6 FPGA, or other FPGAs). It uses a behavior model to generate system clock signals if a XILINX FPGA is not in use. With this detailed orchestration of various sections in response to the FPGA configuration in the `clocks_resets` module, the system is capable of operating in a synchronized and streamlined fashion ensuring precise clock management and reset operations.
