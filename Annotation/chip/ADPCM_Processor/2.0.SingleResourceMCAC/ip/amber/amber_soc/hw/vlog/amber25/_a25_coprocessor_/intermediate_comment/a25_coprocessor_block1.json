    "block_comment": "It seems like you accidentally provided an incomplete code snippet. The \"`endif`\" you provided is generally associated with conditional compilation or synthesis in Verilog code, typically used alongside \"`ifdef`\" or \"`ifndef`\". However, without the rest of the code, it's impossible to accurately provide a comment.\n\nPlease provide a complete block of code so I would be able to generate a straightforward and useful top-level comment. Ideally, the code block should include inputs, outputs, internal logic, and, potentially, any sub-modules that could be instantiated. This will help me provide the most comprehensive comment."
