    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block is focused on handling address mapping and interfacing with an on-chip AXI/MCB bus. It does this through a number of operations and signalling. The block utilizes AXI protocol for interfacing, where the masters initiate read/write transactions by issuing addresses and the slaves respond to these requests. The block assigns new memory locations by applying a mask to the original AXI addresses. It also synchronizes the clock signals between the user external interface and the AXI interfaces. Lastly, it marks the end of calibration process using the signal \"calib_done_synch\"."
