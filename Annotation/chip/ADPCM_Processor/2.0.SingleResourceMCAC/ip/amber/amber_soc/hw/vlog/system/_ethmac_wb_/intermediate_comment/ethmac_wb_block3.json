    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block of code serves to map input signals to output signals directly. Specifically, it transfers the state of the input signals such as 'i_m_wb_ack', 'i_m_wb_err', 'i_m_wb_adr', 'i_m_wb_we', 'i_m_wb_cyc', and 'i_m_wb_stb' to their corresponding output signals \u2013 'o_m_wb_ack', 'o_m_wb_err', 'o_m_wb_adr', 'o_m_wb_we', 'o_m_wb_cyc', and 'o_m_wb_stb' without any modification. This is implemented using Verilog's assignment syntax where each output signal is assigned its corresponding input signal directly."
