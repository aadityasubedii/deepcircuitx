This block of Verilog code is designed to update the value of the 'end_boundary_addr' signal on the positive edge of the incoming clock signal. Utilizing an always block trigger, it calculates the new 'end_boundary_addr' value by subtracting the (datawidth divided by 8) from the defined end address and then adding 1. This modification potentially aligns the 'end_boundary_addr' to the last byte of the defined memory end address.
