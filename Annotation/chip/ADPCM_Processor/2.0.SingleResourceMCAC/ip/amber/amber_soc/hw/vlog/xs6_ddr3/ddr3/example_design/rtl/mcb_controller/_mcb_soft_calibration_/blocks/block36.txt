This block of code manages data write operations for a memory cell in a memory controller. It sets the address of the memory cell, specifies the write mode, and provides the data for writing. If the memory controller is ready, the state advances to 'LDQS_PIN_WRITE_N_TERM', allowing the write operation to go on. If not, the state moves to 'LDQS_PIN_N_TERM_WAIT', pausing the process until the controller becomes ready for the transaction.
