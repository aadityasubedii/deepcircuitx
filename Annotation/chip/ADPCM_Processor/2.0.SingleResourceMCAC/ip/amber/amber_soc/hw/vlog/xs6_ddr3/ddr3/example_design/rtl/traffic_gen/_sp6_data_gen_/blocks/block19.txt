Comment: 
This block primarily sets different binary values for a set of variables, Conditioned on the value of `data_mode_i`. If `data_mode_i` is '101' or '100', all the `SHIFT_x` variables are filled with increasing powers of 2 and `BLANK` is made zero, essentially a bitwise left SHIFT pattern. The same pattern is repeated if `data_mode_i` is '100', which appears to be redundant since this condition is already covered by the first branch. If `data_mode_i` is set to '110' or any other value, the `SHIFT_x` variables are assigned corresponding bitwise NOT values of powers of 2, and `BLANK` is set to 'ff'.
