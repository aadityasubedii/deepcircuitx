This block of code is used for choosing a way in an 8-way set associative cache. It uses a function `pick_way` to determine the next way to be used for cache allocation. The function `pick_way` takes as parameters `valid_bits_r`, which represents the current state of valid bits in the cache, and `random_num`, which provides a source of randomness for the way selection in order to avoid cache collision and ensure a uniform distribution of cache entries. The resulting `next_way` is used for the next cache allocation operation.
