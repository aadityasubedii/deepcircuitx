    "block_comment": "This block implements a delay module in a dynamic RAM (DRAM) system. The code specifically delays the \"ras_n\" signal by a predefined period defined by \"BUS_DELAY\". The incoming \"ras_n\" signal is passed through a delay line, and the result of that process \"ras_n_in\", is assigned to the delayed output. The delay event is triggered by any change to the \"ras_n\" signal."
