    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the number of valid bytes received in a data transfer. Specific actions are carried out based on different conditions. Initially, when the system is reset, the number of valid received bytes (`RxValidBytes`) is set to 1. During the reception of a valid start frame, the `RxValidBytes` is incremented based on the least significant bit of the `RxPointerLSB_rst`. If a valid byte is received but it is not the last byte nor the start of a frame, and the `RxEnableWindow` is true, `RxValidBytes` is incremented by one. All these operations are triggered by a rising edge on the master receive clock (`MRxClk`) or a system reset (`Reset`)."
