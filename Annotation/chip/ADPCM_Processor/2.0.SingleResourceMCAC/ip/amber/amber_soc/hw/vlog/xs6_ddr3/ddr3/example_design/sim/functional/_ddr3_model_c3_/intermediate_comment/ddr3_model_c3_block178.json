    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is used to trigger a receiver function on the rising edge of the dqs_odd signal at index 13. The always block defines that whenever there is a positive edge, i.e., a transition from 0 to 1, on the signal dqs_odd[13], the function 'dqs_odd_receiver' with argument 13 is called. This is a common way to interface with event-driven hardware in RTL code, where certain actions are triggered based on signal changes."
