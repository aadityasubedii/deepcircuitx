The block of code is responsible for updating the signal 'TxStartFrm_syncb1' based on whether a reset signal is received or due to a positive-edge clock (WB_CLK_I). If the system undergoes a reset, 'TxStartFrm_syncb1' is set to '0.' In the absence of a reset, 'TxStartFrm_syncb1' takes the value of 'TxStartFrm_sync2' on the positive edge of WB_CLK_I.
