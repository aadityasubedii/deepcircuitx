    "block_comment": "This block provides the interface for synchronous reset of the transmission process in a system. It operates on the rising edge of either 'WB_CLK_I' clock signal or 'Reset'. In the event of a 'Reset', the signal 'TxDoneSync1' is asynchronously set to logic '0' indicating no transmission activity. Otherwise, during normal operation, 'TxDoneSync1' echoes the 'TxDone' signal state, following the clock event."
