Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a sequential logic block primarily purposed for controlling the "TxAbortPacketBlocked" signal based on conditions of system clock "WB_CLK_I", reset command "Reset", and various transmission control signals "TxAbort_wb", "TxAbort_wb_q" and "TxAbortPacket". During the high phase of reset signal or an opposite status transition between "TxAbort_wb" and "TxAbort_wb_q", the "TxAbortPacketBlocked" signal is set to 0, effectively indicating a non-blocking state. However, when a packet abortion is signalled by "TxAbortPacket", "TxAbortPacketBlocked" is set to 1, representing a blocked signal. The propagation delay "#Tp" ensures that the output of this block incurs the defined delay time.
