Comment: 
This block of code triggers the function "dqs_neg_timing_check(27)" at the positive edge of the "dqs_in[27]" clock signal. Implementation-wise, "always @ (posedge dqs_in[27])" is a Verilog construct that indicates sensitivity to the rising edge of the signal "dqs_in" specifically at element 27. This is commonly used for synchronous operations, where changes occur in sync with the system clock.
