    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code block functions as a delay instrument. Specifically, it controls the delay of the 'ras_n' signal before it is passed as 'ras_n_in'. The block's operation is event-driven, as it unceasingly waits for a change in the 'ras_n' signal (rising edge or falling edge) to initiate the delay process. This delay operation, designated by '#BUS_DELAY', is a non-blocking assignment, allowing subsequent operations to proceed without waiting for this particular assignment to complete."
