Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code specifies a particular edge-triggered live timing check in the system. This check is triggered on the rising edge (indicated by the 'posedge') of the 26th signal in the dqs_in signal vector. The check is performed by the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' which is passed the integer 25 as its argument to indicate which specific signal in 'dqs_in' array the function should consider for this timing check.
