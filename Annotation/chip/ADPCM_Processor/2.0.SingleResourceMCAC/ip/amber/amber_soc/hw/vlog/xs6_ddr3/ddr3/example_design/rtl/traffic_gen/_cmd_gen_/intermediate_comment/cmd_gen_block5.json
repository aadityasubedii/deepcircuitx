    "block_comment": "This block performs a function of a register. Its main function is to store and output values based on the input condition. Upon a positive edge detection of the clk_i input, this block checks for the logical high of the 7th bit of the rst_i input. If the 7th bit of rst_i is high, this block assigns the input fixed_bl_i to the bl_out_reg with a delay defined by the constant TCQ. If the 7th bit of rst_i is not high but bl_out_vld (block output valid signal) is logical high, then this block assigns the bl_out value to the bl_out_reg with the same TCQ delay."
