It allows data to be written (i_write_data) into the array (mem) at an address (i_address) specified when the write enable signal (i_write_enable) is asserted. During the rising edge of the clock(i_clk), if the write enable is not asserted then the data present at the given address location is read onto the output 'o_read_data'. If 'INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO' is set to 1, the SRAM is initialized with all zeros. The 'DATA_WIDTH' parameter sets the bit-width of the data, and 'ADDRESS_WIDTH' sets the total number of addressable locations in the SRAM.\n"
