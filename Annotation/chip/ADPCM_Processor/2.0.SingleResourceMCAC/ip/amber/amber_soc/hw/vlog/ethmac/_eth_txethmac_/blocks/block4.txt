Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is designed to conditionally enable cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and populate the Data CRC. When the state of FCS is not true, the cyclic redundancy check is activated. Following that, depending upon whether the StateData is 0 or 1, specific bits from TxData are conditionally assigned to different indices of Data_Crc. If none of these conditions are met, the bit is assigned as 0.
