    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe a25_barrel_shift module performs shift operations (quick or full) on a 32-bit input. It takes various inputs like carry-in, shift amount, shift immediacy indicator, and function operation, and uses them to decide the type of shift operation. Internal signals store quick and full shift outputs along with registered versions for the full operation. The stall state is indicated for non-zero shift amounts when quick shift is in use. The module uses two instances of the 'a25_shifter' for operations, feeding decision signals to them and gathering outputs. The updated state is registered on every positive clock edge."
