This block of code functions to implement flip-flop-based pipeline registers. It allows data to move sequentially during the active (rising) clock edge, thus introducing a delay specified by `TCQ`. The block utilizes non-blocking assignments with delay controls to achieve this function. For successive clock cycles, it assigns `wait_bl_end`, `data_i`, and some stages of `rd_data_r` to other registers, crucial in controlling and managing data flow within the hardware system. The execution of these assignments at the end of each simulation time step prevents intra-assignment dependencies and race conditions for reliable sequential processing.
