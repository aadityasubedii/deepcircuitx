Module-level comment: This module, a23_barrel_shift, implements a barrel shifter using combinational logic. It features four different shift functions: logical shift left, right, arithmetic shift right, and rotate right for a 32-bit input. The shift amount and function type are determined by 8-bit and 2-bit input signals. The moduleâ€™s outputs include the 32-bit shifted result, and a carry-out signal. Internal signals represent intermediate outcomes for each type of operation. The output is selected based on the requested shift function, making the module highly adaptable.
