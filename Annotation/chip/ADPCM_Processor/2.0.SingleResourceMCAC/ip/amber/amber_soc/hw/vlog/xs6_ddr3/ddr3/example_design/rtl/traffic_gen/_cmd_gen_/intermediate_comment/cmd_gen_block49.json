    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is for conditional instantiation and configuration based on hardware family type. If the hardware family type matches 'VIRTEX6', it begins a named block 'pipe_in_v6'. The specific configuration or instantiation for 'VIRTEX6' is then defined inside this block. This block makes the entire design more flexible and adaptable to different hardware settings, adhering to a good design practice for hardware abstraction and portability."
