Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for instigating the dqs_odd_receiver function call whenever there is a positive edge detected on the 14th element of the dqs_odd array. The 'always' block in Verilog initiates an action, in this case the function call to 'dqs_odd_receiver', based on a triggering event or condition, which is the positive edge of dqs_odd[13] in this context.
