Comment: 
This block of Verilog code captures the most significant bit from a 12-bit address signal on the rising edges of a system clock. An 'always' block synchronous to the positive edge of the input clock (i_clk) is used, which contains an assignment to a register (address_11_r), indicating that the value of the input address (i_address) bit at index 11 will be stored in the register 'address_11_r' on every clock pulse.
