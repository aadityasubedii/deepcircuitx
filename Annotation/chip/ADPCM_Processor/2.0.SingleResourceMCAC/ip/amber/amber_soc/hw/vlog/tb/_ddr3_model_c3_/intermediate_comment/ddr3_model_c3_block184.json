    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code triggers a function conditionally, specifically upon a positive edge of the 7th index signal in the `dqs_odd` bus. The `always` keyword in Verilog is used to define a procedural block of code that gets executed whenever the conditions, specified within the parentheses `@()`, are satisfied. Here, it is used in combination with the `posedge` keyword that detects the positive edge (0 to 1 transition) of a signal. Therefore, whenever there's a positive edge in `dqs_odd[7]`, the procedure `dqs_odd_receiver(7)` is executed."
