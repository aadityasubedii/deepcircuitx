    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code represents an assignment operation, which conveys a continuous assignment statement. The function of this line is to effectively assign the value of `wdp_validC` to the output port `wdp_validC_o`. This operation takes place across every simulation time-step and ensures that the output signal `wdp_validC_o` always represents the current value of the wire `wdp_validC`."
