    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to implement flip-flops in a digital logic circuit, specifically, to store the state of various signals on the rising edge of the clock. The block is sensitive to the positive edge of the input clock (`clk_i`), and on every rising edge, it samples and holds the state of `data_rdy_i` and `cmd_valid_i` signals. It uses gate delays (`#TCQ`) to simulate the time taken in actual hardware execution. The sampled `data_rdy_i` is stored sequentially in `data_rdy_r1` and `data_rdy_r2`, implementing a two-stage pipeline. Similarly, `cmd_valid_i` is stored in `cmd_valid_r1` providing a single stage delay."
