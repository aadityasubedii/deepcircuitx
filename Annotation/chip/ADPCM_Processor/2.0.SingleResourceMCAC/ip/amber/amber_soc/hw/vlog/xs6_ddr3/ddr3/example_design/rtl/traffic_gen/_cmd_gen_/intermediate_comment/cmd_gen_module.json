    "module": "Module-level comment: This module generates memory commands (read, write, refresh) for memory interfaces, supporting various FPGA families and configurable parameters. It implements different addressing modes (fixed, sequential, PRBS) and burst lengths using counters, PRBS generators, and control logic. The module manages address generation, instruction selection, and burst length determination based on input configurations and internal states, outputting command signals for memory operations."
