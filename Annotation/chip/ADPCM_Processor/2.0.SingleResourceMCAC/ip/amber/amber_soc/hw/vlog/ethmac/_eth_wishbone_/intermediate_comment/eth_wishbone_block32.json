    "block_comment": "The block of code is designed for a functionality of synchronous reset and shifting in a digital circuit. If the Reset signal is active at the rising edge of WB_CLK_I, then the 'ShiftEndedSync1' will be reset i.e. it will hold a low state. However, if the Reset signal is not active, the 'ShiftEndedSync1' will take the value of 'ShiftEnded_rck', at the rising edge of WB_CLK_I. The time propagation delay is denoted by '#Tp' and is a design parameter that can be adjusted based on needs.\n"
