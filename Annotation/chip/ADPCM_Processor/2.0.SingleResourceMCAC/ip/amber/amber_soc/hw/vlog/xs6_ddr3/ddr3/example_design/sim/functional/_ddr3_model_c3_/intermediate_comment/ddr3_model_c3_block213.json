    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a task called `cmd_task` that handles various DDR memory commands and operations. Here's a summary of its function and implementation:\n\n[Function of the block]: The `cmd_task` processes DDR memory commands, including Load Mode Register, Refresh, Precharge, Activate, Write, Read, and ZQ operations. It manages the memory state, checks timing violations, and handles power-down and self-refresh modes.\n\n[Implementation details of the block]: The task uses a large case statement to handle different commands based on the input `cmd`. It performs timing checks, updates internal counters and flags, and manages memory bank states. The task also handles initialization sequences, checks for illegal operations, and manages power-down and self-refresh modes. It uses various internal registers and flags to track the memory state and timing information, and it outputs debug and error messages as needed."
