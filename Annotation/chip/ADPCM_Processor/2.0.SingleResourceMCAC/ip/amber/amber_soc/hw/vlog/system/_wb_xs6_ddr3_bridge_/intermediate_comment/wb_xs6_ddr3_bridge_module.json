    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' module serves as a bridge between a Wishbone interface and DDR3 memory. It uses the clock signal and various input signals to write to and read from DDR3 memory through signal assignments, clock-driven processes, and several conditional constructs. It buffers the data, manages transaction requests, and handles commands formation using internal signals and conditional logic. It acknowledges successful operations through output signals and employs generative blocks to support different data widths, ensuring seamless and robust data transfer between the interface and memory."
