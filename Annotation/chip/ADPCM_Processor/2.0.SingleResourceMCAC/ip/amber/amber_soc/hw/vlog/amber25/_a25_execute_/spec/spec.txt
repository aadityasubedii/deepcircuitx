Module name: a25_execute. Module specification: The a25_execute module is a critical component of an ARM processor implementation, responsible for executing instructions and managing the execution stage of the pipeline. It handles instruction decoding, ALU operations, register reads/writes, program counter updates, and status flag management. The module interfaces with various input signals including clock (i_clk), reset (i_reset), stall signals (i_core_stall, i_mem_stall), data from write-back stage (i_wb_read_data), and numerous control signals. It outputs signals such as execution stall (o_exec_stall), write data (o_write_data), address signals (o_iaddress, o_daddress), and status bits (o_status_bits). Internally, it utilizes signals for managing the ALU, barrel shifter, register bank, and multiplication operations. The module is
