Module-level comment: This module implements the register interface for an Ethernet controller. It manages read/write operations for various control and status registers, handles interrupt generation and synchronization, and provides configuration signals for other parts of the Ethernet controller. The module uses multiple sub-registers for different functionalities, implements clock domain crossing for interrupt handling, and includes logic for generating and clearing interrupts based on various events in the Ethernet controller.
