    "block_comment": "The block of code, `Data_Gen`, is a function that generates a sequence of binary data based on an input integer 'i'. It begins by defining a variable 'j' as half of the input integer 'i', then initialises all bits to zeros. Depending on the parity (odd or even) of 'i', it sets different bytes at evenly spaced positions at equidistant locations defined by 'j' and the constant `NUM_DQ_PINS`. If 'i' is odd, the function sets higher order bits at these positions; if 'i' is even, it sets lower order bits. The output size varies depending on the value of `NUM_DQ_PINS`, being `4*NUM_DQ_PINS` bits wide."
