This block generates data (w1data) based on the input address (addr_i) and data mode (data_mode_i). The data generation is done by calling functions Data_Gen and Data_GenW0 with arguments 0-35 based on the value of addr_i[11:6]. The data mode decides which function to use, with hexadecimal value '0101 calling Data_Gen and all other values calling Data_GenW0. The block is active at the positive edge of clk_i and when either fifo_rdy_i signal is high or cmd_startC is true. In case of an unexpected value of addr_i[11:6], the block defaults to set w1data to 0.
