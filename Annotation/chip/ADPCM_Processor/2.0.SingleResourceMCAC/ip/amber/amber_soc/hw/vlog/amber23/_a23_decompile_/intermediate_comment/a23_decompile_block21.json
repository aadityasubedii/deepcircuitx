    "block_comment": "The block carries out the reading of data by utilizing an address and signalling if the reading process has been aborted. The process is initiated by checking certain signals, and if they meet a specific condition, the read action is commenced. This includes capturing the address from get_32bit_signal(2) then writing the address to a decompile file. Subsequently, it fetches the data using get_32bit_signal(4) and writes this to the same file along with an 'aborted' signal, depending on the status of get_1bit_signal(2)."
