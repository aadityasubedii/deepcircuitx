This block manages the loading of the `hdata` register based on system readiness and data burst count or start command conditions. On the rising edge of the `clk_i` signal, the block resets the `hdata` to 0 when the reset flag `rst_i` is activated. Otherwise, depending on specific conditions indicated by `fifo_rdy_i` and `user_burst_cnt`, or the `cmd_startC` command, it will load `hdata` with different hex values considering the number of Data Query (`DQ`) pins set in the system. For 16, 8, or 4 DQ pins systems, the respective values loaded are `32'h0000_FFFF`, `32'h00FF_00FF`, and `32'h0F0F_0F0F`. The loaded data has a delay of `TCQ` to model propagation time.
