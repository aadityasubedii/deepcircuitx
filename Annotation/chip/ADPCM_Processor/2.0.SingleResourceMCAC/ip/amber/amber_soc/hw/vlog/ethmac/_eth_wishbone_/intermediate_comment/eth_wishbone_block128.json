    "block_comment": "This block sets the value of \"TxPointerLSB_rst\" based on different conditions. It responds to the rising edge of the WB_CLK_I signal or the Reset. If Reset is active, \"TxPointerLSB_rst\" is set to 0. If \"TxEn\" and \"TxEn_q\" are enabled and \"TxPointerRead\" is set to true it takes the 2 LSBs from \"ram_do\". If \"MasterWbTX\" is active and acknowledgment from master is received \"m_wb_ack_i\", then the \"TxPointerLSB_rst\" is set to 0."
