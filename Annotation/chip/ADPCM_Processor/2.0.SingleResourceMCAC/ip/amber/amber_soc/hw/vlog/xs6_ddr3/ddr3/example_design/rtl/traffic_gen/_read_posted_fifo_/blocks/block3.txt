Comment: 
This block is essentially a flip-flop for the 'empty' signal. It operates at the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk_i'. The 'empty' signal state is stored in 'empty_r' once the delay specified by 'TCQ' time units has passed after every positive edge of the 'clk_i'. This flip-flop-based design helps in synchronizing the 'empty' signal with the system clock, thus aligning its state changes with the clock's positive edge and providing control over the delay using 'TCQ'.
