This block of Verilog code serves the function of a synchronous reset design for a PauseTimer with two stages of synchronization. Upon detecting a positive edge of either the MTxClk signal or the TxReset signal, the code block will be executed. If the TxReset signal is high, the two synchronization stages PauseTimerEq0_sync1 and PauseTimerEq0_sync2 will instantly be set to binary 1 after a delay of Tp units. Alternatively, if the TxReset signal is not high, PauseTimerEq0_sync1 will be set to the value of PauseTimerEq0, while PauseTimerEq0_sync2 will be set to the value of PauseTimerEq0_sync1. Both assignments will also take effect after delays of Tp units. With this design, changes in the PauseTimer output can be safely captured and processed within two clock cycles.
