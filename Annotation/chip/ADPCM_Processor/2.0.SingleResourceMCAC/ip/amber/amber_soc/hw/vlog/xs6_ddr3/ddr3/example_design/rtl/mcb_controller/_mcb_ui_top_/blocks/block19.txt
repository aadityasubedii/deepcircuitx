The block is responsible for interfacing with AXI protocols by utilizing and setting up the axi_mcb hardware block. The P2_UI_AXI provides connection specifics, like enabling arbitration and setting the AXI addresses, and interfaces with the 'spartan6' axi_mcb module. The block identifies the AXI read and write addresses, interfaces with a synchronization block (mcb_ui_top_synch), synchronizes calibration completion (calib_done_synch), and sets all the necessary AXI signals for the axi_mcb module. The axi_mcb block is highly parameterizable, allowing for a variety of AXI configurations. All the inputs and outputs of the axi_mcb module are connected subsequently.
