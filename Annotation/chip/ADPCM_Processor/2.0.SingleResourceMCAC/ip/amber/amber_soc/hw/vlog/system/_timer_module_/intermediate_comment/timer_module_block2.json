    "block_comment": "This Verilog block monitors bus reading and writing activities, specifically related to timer modules in an Amber IC. Activated on a positive clock edge, it tracks if a write acknowledgement is received or a write operation starts, and then logs the data being read or written. It additionally decodes addresses to specify which timer module's register (like a timer's Load, Control, Value, or Clear register) has been accessed. If the address doesn't correspond to any known register, it logs it as an unknown Amber IC Register region and alerts an error."
