    "block_comment": "This block is a write data generator for various modes on a memory command start. Its design caters for different cases of data address inputs and data modes, ranging through different types of data generation functions. For each case, a comparison of data_mode_i to a predefined bit-vector decides the function to be assigned to w1data, which seems to be the write data. If the data_mode_i does not match the predefined bit-vector, then a different data generation function is called. In another case, if memory burst length is equal to 8, bit shifting operations are performed on w1data to generate new outputs. Overall, the block takes sequential inputs from a memory address and data mode, and then assigns the output of an appropriate function to w1data."
