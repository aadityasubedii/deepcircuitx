    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for triggering the `dq_timing_check` function whenever there is a change in the 24th bit of the `dq_in` signal. The `always @` condition is set to monitor the 24th bit of `dq_in`, and when any flip happens in this bit, the `dq_timing_check` function is invoked with `23` as an argument. This implementation allows for real-time monitoring and testing of the timing conditions for the specific bit in the `dq_in` signal array."
