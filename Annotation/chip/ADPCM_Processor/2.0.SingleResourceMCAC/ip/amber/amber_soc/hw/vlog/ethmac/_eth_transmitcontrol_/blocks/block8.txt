This block of code is responsible for generating the ResetByteCnt signal. This is achieved by assigning the bitwise OR of the TxReset signal, and the bitwise AND of the negation of TxCtrlStartFrm, and either the TxDoneIn or TxAbortIn signals. The ResetByteCnt signal can be activated when either the transmission is manually reset or when the transmission hasn't started but has either done or aborted.
