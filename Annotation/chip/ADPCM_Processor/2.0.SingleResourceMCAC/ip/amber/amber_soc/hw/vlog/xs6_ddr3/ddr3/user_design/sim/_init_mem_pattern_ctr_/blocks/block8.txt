Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code describes a state machine handle. The state machine is controlled by a rising edge clock (clk_i) and a reset (rst_i) signal. When a reset signal arrives (rst_i is true), the current state is reset to '00001'. Otherwise, the current state follows the nextState, which isn't directly defined in this code block and presumably determined elsewhere in the logic.
