    "block_comment": "The block is used for address assignment and synchronization in an AXI interface for memory controller block (MCB). It masks the input addresses using a defined mask, and synchronizes the calibration result. The block mainly consists of two modules. The `mcb_ui_top_synch` module takes clock signal and calibration done signal as inputs, and outputs a synchronized calibration done signal. The `axi_mcb` module interfaces with both the AXI bus and the MCB, signaling reads, writes, and other operations on the bus and MCB under different AXI protocol flags, and also utilizes the synchronized calibration done signal from the `mcb_ui_top_synch` module."
