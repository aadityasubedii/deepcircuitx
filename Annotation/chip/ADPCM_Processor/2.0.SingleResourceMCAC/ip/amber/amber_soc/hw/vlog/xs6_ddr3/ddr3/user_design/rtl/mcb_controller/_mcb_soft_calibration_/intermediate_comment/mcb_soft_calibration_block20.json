    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for resetting and counting utilizing UI_CLK and RST signals. At the raising edge of either UI_CLK or RST, if RST is true, both Block_Reset and RstCounter are set to zero. Otherwise, Block_Reset is held at '0' and RstCounter gets updated. If Pre_SYSRST is true, RstCounter is set to the value RST_CNT. If Pre_SYSRST is false and 'RstCounter' is less than 'TZQINIT_MAXCNT', 'Block_Reset' is set to '1' and RstCounter is incremented."
