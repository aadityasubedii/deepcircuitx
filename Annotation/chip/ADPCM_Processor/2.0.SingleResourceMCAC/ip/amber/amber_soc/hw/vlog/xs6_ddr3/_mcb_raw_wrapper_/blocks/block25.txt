This block is an instantiation of an OSERDES2 component that manages on-die termination (ODT) when the memory type is DDR2 or DDR3. The OSERDES2 component is configured based on predefined constants and is always enabled (OCE = 1'b1, TCE = 1'b1) with the reset signal driven by the internal system reset (RST). The input data (D1 and D2) are driven by odt_90, the clock signal is given by ioclk0, and the output goes to ioi_odt. All other data and shift inputs are zeroed, indicating no shift operation occurs. The OQ output is not buffered (BYPASS_GCLK_FF), and training mode is disabled (TRAIN = 1'b0). The clock enable signal for the PLL (IOCE) is driven by pll_ce_0.
