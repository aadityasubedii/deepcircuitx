Module name: eth_top. Module specification: The eth_top module is the top-level module for an Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) implementation. It integrates various sub-modules to handle Ethernet communication, including Wishbone interface for host communication, MII (Media Independent Interface) for physical layer communication, MAC control for handling flow control and pause frames, transmit and receive Ethernet frames, management interface (MIIM) for PHY configuration, register block for configuration and status, and buffer descriptors for frame data management. The module has numerous input and output ports for clock (wb_clk_i, mtx_clk_pad_i, mrx_clk_pad_i), reset (wb_rst_i), Wishbone interface (wb_dat_i, wb_dat_o, wb_adr_i, wb_sel_i, wb_we_i, wb_cyc_
