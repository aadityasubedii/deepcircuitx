    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for incrementing the variable 'N_Term' and transitioning the state of the design to 'LOAD_ZIO_NTERM'. The increment operation is done by taking the current value of 'N_Term' and adding one to it. Then, the state of the design is changed by assigning the state 'LOAD_ZIO_NTERM' to the state variable 'STATE'."
