Comment: 
This block dynamically generates hardware components based on the condition if the FPGA family is "VIRTEX6". The generate statement in Verilog enables conditional instantiation of hardware elements, here the instance INC_COUNTS_V is activated only for VIRTEX6 FPGA family. It's worth noting that without the rest of the code, not all details about this block's specific function and how it's implemented can be provided.
