Comment: 
The block of code generates a transmission done pulse, which is an indication of the completion of data transmission. Implementing this functionality, the block uses a wire assignment `TxDonePulse` which is assigned the value of the bitwise AND operation between the currently transmitted word `TxDone_wb` and the negated previously transmitted word `TxDone_wb_q`.
