    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronous reset mechanism, that uses sys_rst to reset the pll_locked signal and a clock signal (clk0_bufg) to update it. The implementation uses an always block that is sensitive to either a system reset or a positive edge of the clock signal. When system reset (sys_rst) is high, it sets the syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked signal to 0 (resets signal). If the system is not in reset, and the bufpll_mcb_locked signal is high, indicating that the phase-locked loop (PLL) has locked on to the input frequency, the syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked signal is set to 1."
