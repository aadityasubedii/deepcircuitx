This code block acts as a multiplexer (MUX) for selecting one of various stored values. Whenever the input signal 'i_rs_sel' changes, the selected output is updated and stored in the 'o_rd'. This value of 'i_rs_sel' (0 to 14) determines which register value is chosen as output. If no case matches 'i_rs_sel', it defaults to assigning 'r15_out_rm_nxt' to 'o_rd'.
