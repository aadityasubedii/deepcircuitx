This block of code is a register that maintains the "full" status of a buffer memory. It is activated on the rising edge of the write clock (wr_clk). If the reset input (rst) is high, the block resets the "full" status to 0. On the other hand, if the buffer availability (buf_avail) is either 0 or 1 while the write enable (wr_en) is high, it sets the "full" status to 1. In all other cases, the "full" status is reset to 0. The condition handling is synchronous with #TCQ delay to ensure the defined setup and hold times.
