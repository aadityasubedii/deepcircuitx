The block of code is a state transition logic in a Finite State Machine (FSM). It implements the functionality of waiting until a specific condition is met --i.e., the signal `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` becomes high (or '1'). In this phase, named `LDQS_WAIT1`, as long as `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` remains low (or '0'), the state does not change and stays at `LDQS_WAIT1`. However, once the `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` condition is satisfied, the state transitions to `LDQS_WRITE_NEG_INDELAY`.
