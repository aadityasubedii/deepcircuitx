    "block_comment": "The block of code is a digital logic design in Verilog that determines the status of the 'Busy_IRQ' signal. This is done using a bitwise AND operation between 'Busy_IRQ_sync2' and the bitwise negation of 'Busy_IRQ_sync3'. In essence, the 'Busy_IRQ' signal will be set to active (1) only when 'Busy_IRQ_sync2' is true (1), and 'Busy_IRQ_sync3' is false (0)."
