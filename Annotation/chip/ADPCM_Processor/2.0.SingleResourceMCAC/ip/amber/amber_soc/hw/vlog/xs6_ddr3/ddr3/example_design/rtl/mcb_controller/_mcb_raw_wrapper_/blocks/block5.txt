This block addresses the configuration of the I/O buffers of memory interface according to different types of memory used. Using "generate-if" Verilog construct, it determines the memory type (DDR, MDDR, DDR2 etc.) based on the "C_MEM_TYPE" parameter. If the memory type is either DDR or MDDR, or it's DDR2 without a differential DQ signal enabled, it instantiates an IOBUF (bidirectional single ended I/O buffer) named 'iob_dqs', connecting memory, input, tri-state controls and pre-driver. Otherwise, it instantiates a IOBUFDS (I/O buffer for differential signal) 'iob_dqs', additionally connecting it with the negation of memory data strobe. This setup ensures appropriate signal handling for both single-ended and differential-signalling memory types.
