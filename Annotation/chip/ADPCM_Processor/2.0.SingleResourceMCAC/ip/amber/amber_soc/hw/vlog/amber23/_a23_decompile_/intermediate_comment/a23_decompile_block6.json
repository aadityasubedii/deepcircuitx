    "block_comment": "This function reads the value of a specific register within the U_REGISTER_BANK module. The register to be read is specified by the 'regnum' input which can range from 0 to 21. Through a case statement, depending on the value of the 'regnum' input, the function returns the value of the corresponding register. If 'regnum' is 0, for instance, the current value of \"r0_out\" register would be returned, or if 'regnum' is 15, it would return the value of \"r15_out_rm\" register, and so on. This is how the function is designed to enable register read operations."
