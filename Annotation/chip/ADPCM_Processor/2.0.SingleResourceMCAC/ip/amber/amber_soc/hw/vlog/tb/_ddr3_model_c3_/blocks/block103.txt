Comment: 
This block of code triggers a function named `dq_timing_check` whenever there is a change in the 28th bit of the `dq_in` input data. This function is particularly designed to handle timing checks for the relevant bit. This statement is designed as a sensitivity list such that every time there is an alteration in the value of `dq_in[27]`, the `dq_timing_check(27)` function is automatically invoked.
