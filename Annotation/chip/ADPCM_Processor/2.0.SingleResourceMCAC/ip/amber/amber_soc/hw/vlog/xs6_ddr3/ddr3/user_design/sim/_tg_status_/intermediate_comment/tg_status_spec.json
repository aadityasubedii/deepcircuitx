    "spec": "Module name: tg_status. \nModule specification: The tg_status module is a status tracking unit designed specifically for a test generator. It monitors various inputs related to data errors and memory controller buffer statuses, and upon detecting a data error, it sets an error status detailing the error's address, Burst_Length (BL), compared and read data and the statuses of the command, write, and read buffers in the memory controller. The module uses inputs such as clk_i for clock signal, rst_i for reset, manual_clear_error for manual error clearance, data_error_i, cmp_data_i, rd_data_i, cmp_addr_i, cmp_bl_i for data error and related details, and mcb_cmd_full_i, mcb_wr_full_i, mcb_rd_empty_i for memory controller buffer statuses. Outputs include error_status with detailed error information and error as an error flag. The module uses internal signals like data_error_r, which is a registered version of the data error input, and error_set, a signal that is set when a data error is detected. These signals play a key role in error detection and status updating processes. The module's operations are divided into different blocks; the first block stores the previous state of the data error, while the second block handles the error detection, status updating, and error clearance.",
