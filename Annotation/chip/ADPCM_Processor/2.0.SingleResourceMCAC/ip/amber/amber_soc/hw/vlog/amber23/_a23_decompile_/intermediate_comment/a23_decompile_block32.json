    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for the execution of certain operations based on instruction evaluations. It uses bitwise operations to assess and assign specific bits of the execute_instruction data. The 'no_shift' operation checks if the bits from 4th to 11th of the 'execute_instruction' data are all zeros. The 'mtrans_itype' takes the 23rd and 24th bits of the same instruction. The block also compares 'opcode' with the given operators (CMP, CMN, TEQ, TST) and assigns the result to the 'opcode_compare'."
