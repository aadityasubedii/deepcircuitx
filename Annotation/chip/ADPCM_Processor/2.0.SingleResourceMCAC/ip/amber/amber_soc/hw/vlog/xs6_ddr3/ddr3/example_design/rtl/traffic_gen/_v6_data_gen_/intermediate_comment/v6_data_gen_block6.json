    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to configure the data generation pattern, specifically when the `DATA_PATTERN` value is \"DGEN_ADDR\" or \"DGEN_ALL\". This is achieved through a conditional check within the generated statement. The 'generate' clause is used to create configuration-based RTL that allows a specific piece of hardware logic to be activated or deactivated based on the condition specified. In this case, it checks if `DATA_PATTERN` is equal to either \"DGEN_ADDR\" or \"DGEN_ALL\", if so, it begins a block labelled `ADDRESS_PATTERN`."
