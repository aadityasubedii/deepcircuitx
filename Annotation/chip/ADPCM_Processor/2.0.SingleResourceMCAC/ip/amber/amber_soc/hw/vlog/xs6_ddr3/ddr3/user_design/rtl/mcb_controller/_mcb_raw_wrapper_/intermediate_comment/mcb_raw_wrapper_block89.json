    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to set local parameters for a memory module, specifically for DDR3 and DDR2 memory and mobile traffic controller functionality. The `C_MEM_DDR3_ADD_LATENCY` variable is set to \"OFF\", indicating that the additional latency feature for the DDR3 memory is deactivated. The `C_MEM_DDR2_ADD_LATENCY` parameter is set to 0 which means that there is no additional latency for the DDR2 memory. Lastly, the `C_MEM_MOBILE_TC_SR` variable, which could potentially relate to a self-refresh functionality in a mobile traffic controller, is also set to 0, pointing that this feature is switched off."
