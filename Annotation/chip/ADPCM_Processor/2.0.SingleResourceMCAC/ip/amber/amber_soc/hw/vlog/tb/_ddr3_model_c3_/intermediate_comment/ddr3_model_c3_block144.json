    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is assigned the function of running a data management timing check when the third index (dm_in[3]) changes in its value. This is achieved with the 'always' statement that constantly monitors the dm_in[3] signal. Once there's a change in the value of dm_in[3], it triggers the dm_timing_check function, passing '3' as an argument to perform a timing validation at the corresponding index."
