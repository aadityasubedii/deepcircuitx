    "block_comment": "This block of code contains a always block that triggers on the negative edge of the array element 'dqs_in[11]' in Verilog. This routine invokes a procedural call to 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function with '11' as the argument whenever there is a change from high to low in the 11th bit of the 'dqs_in' array, allowing the digital system to perform specific operations associated with negative edge timing checks."
