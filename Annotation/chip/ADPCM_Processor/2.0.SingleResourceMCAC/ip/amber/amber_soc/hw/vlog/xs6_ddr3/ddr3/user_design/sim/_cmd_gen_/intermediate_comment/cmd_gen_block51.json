    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block schedules the validity of a specific command based on the rising edge of the input clock. When a positive edge of the input clock 'clk_i' is detected, the command validity 'cmd_vld' gets updated post a specified time clock queue delay '#TCQ'. The command validity is governed by the disjunction of 'cmd_clk_en' (clock enable for the command) and the combination of 'mode_load_pulse' & 'first_load_pulse'. Here the logic operation '&' is a bitwise AND operation, while '|' is a bitwise OR operation."
