Module-level comment: This is the a23_wishbone module, an interface for Wishbone standard that manages read, write, and cache requests. It contains both input controls (like `i_clk`, `i_select`) and outputs (like `o_stall`, `o_wb_adr`). It operates with a state machine (`wishbone_st`), handling different states and request transitions. Specific operations like read, write, and cache are controlled by requests signals e.g., `core_read_request`, `cache_write_request`. The code maintains write buffer signal registers (`wbuf_addr_r`, `wbuf_sel_r`, `wbuf_busy_r`) for proper write operations.
