Comment: 
The block handles the inputs and conditions under the control state and status bits mode during the active clock cycle when there is no core stall. It's implemented using condition checks and data assignments within an always block. The 'irq' and 'firq' values are directly assigned from the corresponding inputs. The 'dabt_reg' is set to zero when 'control_state' equals 'INT_WAIT1' and 'status_bits_mode_r' equals 'SVC'; otherwise, it takes the logical OR of current 'dabt_reg' and input 'i_dabt'. Furthermore, the 'dabt_reg' value is stored in 'dabt_reg_d1' at the end.
