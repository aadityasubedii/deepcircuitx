    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the address mode registration of BRAM in specific situations. It responds to the positive edge of the input clock. If the input reset at the 4th bit is high, depending on the command pattern, it sets the address mode register to either 3'b000 or 3'b011 with an annotated delay '#TCQ'. If the reset bit is low and a mode load pulse occurs, the value of the input address mode is registered to the address mode register, again with an applied delay '#TCQ'."
