    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the timing control for a memory interface training sequence, specifically via the `cke_train_reg` register. Upon system reset, the training register is forcibly set to zero. However, in the absence of a system reset, it is toggled based on the completion of a predetermined waiting period represented by the `wait_200us_done_r1` and `wait_200us_done_r2` flags. When the waiting period has concluded (captured by a high state on `wait_200us_done_r1` and a low state on `wait_200us_done_r2`), the training register is set to high, effectively enabling the training sequence. Conversely, when the Up/Output stage of the training sequence is complete as denoted by `uo_done_cal`, it is reset to zero, indicating the training sequence has completed."
