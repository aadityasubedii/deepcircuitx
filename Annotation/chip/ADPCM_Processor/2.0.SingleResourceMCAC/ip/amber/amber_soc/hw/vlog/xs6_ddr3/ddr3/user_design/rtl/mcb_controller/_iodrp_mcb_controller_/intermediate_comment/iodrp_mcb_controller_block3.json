    "block_comment": "This block controls the value assigned to the DRP_SDI signal. It uses three control signals: rd_not_write_reg, DRP_CS, and DRP_ADD. If rd_not_write_reg AND DRP_CS are HIGH, and DRP_ADD is LOW, the signal DRP_SDI is assigned the value of DRP_SDO. If the condition is not met, the previous value of DRP_SDI (DRP_SDI_pre) is maintained. This scheme is a way to selectively update the value of DRP_SDI based on certain control conditions.\n"
