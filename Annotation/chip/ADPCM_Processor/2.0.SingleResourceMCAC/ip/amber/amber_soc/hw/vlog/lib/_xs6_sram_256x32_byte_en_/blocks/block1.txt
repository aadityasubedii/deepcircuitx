This block of Verilog code checks the integrity of the data and address widths. It tests to make sure DATA_WIDTH is set to 32 and ADDRESS_WIDTH is set to 8. If these conditions are not met, it triggers a warning message indicating the incorrect parameters of DATA_WIDTH or ADDRESS_WIDTH. This is accomplished using the initial block to run the checks at the start, and the $display function to output the warning messages.
