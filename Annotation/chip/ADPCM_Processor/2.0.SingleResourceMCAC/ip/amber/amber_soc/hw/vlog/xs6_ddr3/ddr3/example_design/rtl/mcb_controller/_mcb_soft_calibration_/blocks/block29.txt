Comment: 
The code block is a section of a finite state machine (FSM) managing termination resistors associated with data strobe signal pins in a memory controller. If "MCB_RDY_BUSY_N" signal is not ready, which could be due to memory controller not ready or busy, the FSM stays in the current "UDQS_PIN_P_TERM_WAIT" state. Else, it transitions to the "UDQS_PIN_WRITE_N_TERM" state where termination resistors for write operations are set up.
