Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: The memc_wrapper module is a memory controller (MCB) interface wrapper that provides multiple ports (up to 6) for accessing memory, supporting both standard and AXI interfaces. It handles various memory types (e.g., DDR3) and includes parameters for configuring memory timings, sizes, and other characteristics. The module has numerous input ports for clock signals, reset, PLL control, memory interface commands, write data, and read control signals. Output ports include memory control signals to the DRAM, status signals for calibration and self-refresh mode, and status/data signals for each of the memory interfaces. Internal signals facilitate data transfer, manage timing, and provide status information within the module. The code is structured with parameter declarations, port declarations, and instantiation of the mcb_ui_top module, which implements the core memory controller functionality. The wrapper encapsulates this core functionality
