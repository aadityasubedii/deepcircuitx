    "block_comment": "This block updates the write pointer in response to a rising clock edge signal. It converts the binary number of the write pointer to an 8-bit gray code and assigns it to `wr_pointer_d1`. On the next rising clock edge, it transfers the value of `wr_pointer_d1` to `wr_pointer_d2`, effectively creating a two-stage latch system for updating the write pointer in gray code format."
