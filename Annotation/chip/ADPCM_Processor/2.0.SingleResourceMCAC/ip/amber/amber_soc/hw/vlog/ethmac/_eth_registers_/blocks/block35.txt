This block assigns certain bits of the `MODEROut` output to different control signals. Each bit of `MODEROut` corresponds to a control signal, i.e., bits 16, 15, 14, ...down to 2 are each assigned directly to `r_RecSmall`, `r_Pad`, `r_HugEn`, ..., etc. The last two assignments, `r_TxEn` and `r_RxEn`, are not only assigned to bits 1 and 0 of `MODEROut` respectively, but also have some extra logic with `TX_BD_NUMOut` included to determine their final value. Specifically, `r_TxEn` is high only when `MODEROut[1]` and `TX_BD_NUMOut` are both high, and `r_RxEn` is high only when `MODEROut[0]` is high and `TX_BD_NUMOut` is less than a hex value of 80.
