This block is a data generation logic module handling different memory modes and addresses. When a clock edge is detected and either the FIFO is ready or the command 'cmd_startC' is initiated, it checks the 'sel_w1gen_logic' flag. If 'true', it decides the data generation mechanism 'Data_Gen' or 'Data_GenW0' to use based on input 'data_mode_i' (4'b0101 signals for 'Data_Gen'), and invokes it with the taken 5 bits of 'addr_i' as argument. Depending on the encoded address, w1data is populated. The same is done for addresses from 0 to 21. If address does not fall in any of these, the bytes are cleared to 0. In the case of an 8-length memory burst, w1data is shifted and concatenation is done to produce the final data.
