    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is for a flip-flop control logic. The flip-flop is sensitive to the positive edge of the MTxClk or TxReset signals. If the TxReset signal is active (high), the flip-flop is reset, and the output TxUsedDataIn_q becomes zero after a delay period (#Tp). If the TxReset signal is not active and there is a positive edge on the MTxClk, the current value of TxUsedDataIn is passed to the output TxUsedDataIn_q after the same delay period (#Tp)."
