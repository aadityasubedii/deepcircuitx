Comment: 
This block assigns a value to the signal `ex_read_cache_busy`. This signal indicates if the cache is busy exclusively reading data. It is determined by a logical AND operation on `exclusive_access` (another signal that tells us an exclusive access has been made to the cache) and the logical NOT operation on `i_write_enable` (a signal that permits writing into the cache). Further, the cache's current state `c_state` should not be idle (`CS_IDLE`). Hence, the signal essentially captures when an exclusive read access is underway in the cache, blocking other concurrent accesses.
