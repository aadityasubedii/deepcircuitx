    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the output from the function mode_name to the variable xMODE, with status_bits_mode_r passed as an argument to the function. The operation of this line is contingent on how the mode_name function is implemented, the contents of the status_bits_mode_r variable at runtime and the timing of the clock cycles during simulation. The function mode_name appears to translate a given mode status into a certain mode, possibly functioning as a decoder or mapper."
