Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles the synchronization of a command validation signal. Within the design, it functions by setting the `cmd_vld` signal on the rising edge of a clock signal `clk_i`. The block uses non-blocking assignments and introduces delay defined by the constant `#TCQ` to mimic clock domain crossings for `cmd_clk_en`, making it suitable for synchronous designs.
