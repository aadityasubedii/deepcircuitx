    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns data to the 'o_copro_read_data' register based on the input 'i_copro_crn'. The conditionals particularly check for a clock 'i_clk' edge and a 'i_core_stall' signal. If 'i_core_stall' is false, a 'case' control structure inspecting 'i_copro_crn' is implemented to select the value to be posted to 'o_copro_read_data'. Different sections of memory are accessed and signals are delivered pursuant to the value of 'i_copro_crn'. In the absence of predefined cases, 'o_copro_read_data' defaults to '32'd0'."
