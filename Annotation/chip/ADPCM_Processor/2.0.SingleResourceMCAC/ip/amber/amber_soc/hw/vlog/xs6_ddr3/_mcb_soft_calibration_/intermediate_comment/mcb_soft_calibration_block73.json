    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is set up to respond to the reset (RST) signal. Whenever the reset signal is triggered, the code will set the value of the CKE_Train variable to logical zero. The block achieves its function through the use of an \"always\" control-flow statement, which provides functionality similar to a loop in general-purpose programming languages, continuously checking for changes in the condition (RST in this case)."
