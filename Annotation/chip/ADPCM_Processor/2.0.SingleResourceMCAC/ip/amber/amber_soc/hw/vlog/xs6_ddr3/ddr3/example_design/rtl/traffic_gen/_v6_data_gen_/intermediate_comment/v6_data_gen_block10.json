    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code represents the implementation of a pipelined multiplier. This multiplier is coming as a series of blocks that ranging from 0 to PIPED-STAGES, where each block represents an individual stage of the pipeline. Inside each stage, the logic of multiplication is handled by the `mult` module which takes two inputs `a` and `b` and multiplies them together to produce an output `c`. The flow of control across these stages is administered by a set of n flip-flops which managing the asynchronous transfer of multiplied results to the next stage. The depth of pipeline is defined at the generating stage by the `generate`...`endgenerate` loops, where the value of PIPED-STAGES dynamically defines the total number of flip-flop stages. This design enables the hardware to perform multiplication operations more efficiently by partitioning the operation into a set of sequential stages, each of which can be executed independently."
