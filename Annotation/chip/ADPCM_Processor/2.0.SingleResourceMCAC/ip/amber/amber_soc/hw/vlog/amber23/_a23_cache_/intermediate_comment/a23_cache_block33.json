    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is used to assign the value of the `read_miss` signal to the `read_stall` signal. It implements a decoder mechanism where if a read operation misses, the stall signal is asserted, which can be used to pause the pipeline or reorder commands at a higher level to manage dependencies and prevent hazards."
