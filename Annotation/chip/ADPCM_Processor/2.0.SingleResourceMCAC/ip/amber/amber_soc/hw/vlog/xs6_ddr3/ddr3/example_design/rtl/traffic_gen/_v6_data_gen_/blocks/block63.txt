This Verilog function `Data_GenW0` generates a 4*NUM_DQ_PINS bit wide data pattern based on the input integer 'i'. The function first assigns every bit in `Data_GenW0` to 1, then uses the condition if 'i' is odd or even to update certain byte lanes in the `Data_GenW0`. If 'i' is odd, bytes within `Data_GenW0` at positions calculated as `NUM_DQ_PINS*j*8` for j = 0 to 3 are updated with pattern `8'b11101111`, `8'b11011111`, `8'b10111111`, `8'b01111111`. On the contrary, for even 'i', these bytes are updated with pattern `8'b11111110`, `8'b11111101`, `8'b11111011`, `8'b11110111`. Here 'j' is half of the input integer 'i'.
