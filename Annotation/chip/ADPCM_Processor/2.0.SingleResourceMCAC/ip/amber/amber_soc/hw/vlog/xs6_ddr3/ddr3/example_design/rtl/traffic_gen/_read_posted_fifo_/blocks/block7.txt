The code block is a control logic for the count of data read requests in a Verilog RTL design. The counter is reset to zero on a system reset (signaled by rst_i). On each positive edge of the clock (clk_i), if the cmd_en_i signal is enabled and the least significant bit of cmd_sent register is high (indicating a data read request). The counter (rd_data_counts_asked) then increments by the result of current bl_sent value plus one with a delay of #TCQ time units. The delayed increment is implemented using non-blocking assignments in order to avoid race conditions.
