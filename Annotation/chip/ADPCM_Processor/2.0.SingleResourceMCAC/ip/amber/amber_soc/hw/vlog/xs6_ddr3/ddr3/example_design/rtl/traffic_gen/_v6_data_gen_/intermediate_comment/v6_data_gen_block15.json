    "block_comment": "This block handles the case when the memory burst length is equal to 8 for a memory write operation. It manages the data transfer process by segmenting the w1data vector into four sections related to the number of data pins and then shifting each section by four bits position, with a delay equivalent to the clock quality (TCQ). The shifting operation is realized through the use of concat operation and delay control, which rearrange the elements present in each data segment of the w1data vector."
