    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is designed to handle errors in a data stream, be it manually cleared or auto reset upon errors detected. Upon each rising edge of the clock, the code checks the reset input 'rst_i[1]' or manual clear error flag. If either is active, it resets the error_byte register and the data_error signal. If reset is not issued, the error_byte register captures the current error byte and the data_error signal indicates whether there was an error by performing a bitwise OR operation on the error_byte register. Additionally, if an error is detected, it also prints an error message displaying the expected and received data at the current time."
