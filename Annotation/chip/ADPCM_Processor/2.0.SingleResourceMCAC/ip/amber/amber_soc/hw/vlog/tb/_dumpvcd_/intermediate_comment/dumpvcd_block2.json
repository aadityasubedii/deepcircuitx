    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the initialization and display of variables for debugging purposes in a Verilog testbench. At the start, it displays a message indicating the range of value dumping, which is determined by the logic module's start and length macro variables. It then begins a variety dump, starting with the clock count, followed by execution-related variables including write enable, exclusive, write data, base addresses, program counter, and register bank. Furthermore, fetch, cache, decode, wishbone, and Amber are also included in the dump. Thereafter, if Amber A25 core is defined, the memory and d-cache related variables are dumped. The block ends with triggering a dumpoff function, stopping dumping requests until either $dumpon or $dumpall is executed."
