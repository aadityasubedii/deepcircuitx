    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThis Verilog module, mcb_flow_control, acts as a finite state machine (FSM), cycling through different operations (read, write, and refresh commands) for a memory controller. It uses input signals to control the flow and switches between different operational states, regulating input-output commands, addresses, and other operational details. Its core functionality is implemented through specific blocks of code that handle states like READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT and REFRESH_ST. It uses internal signals for effective command management and validation while ensuring synchronization using clock and reset inputs."
