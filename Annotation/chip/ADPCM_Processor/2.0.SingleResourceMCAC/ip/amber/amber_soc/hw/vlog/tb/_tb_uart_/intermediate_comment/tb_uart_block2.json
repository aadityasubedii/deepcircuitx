    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for managing the write pointer of a UART transmission FIFO (txfifo_wp). If the reset condition is met, the write pointer is reset to zero. In non-loopback mode, if transmission data is ready and the FIFO isn't full, the code inserts the transmission data (txd) into the FIFO and increments the write pointer. If the FIFO is full under the same conditions, an overflow warning is generated. In loopback mode, when the receiver state machine is in a particular state and a start bit is identified, the received byte (rx_byte) is inserted into the FIFO with the write pointer incremented thereafter."
