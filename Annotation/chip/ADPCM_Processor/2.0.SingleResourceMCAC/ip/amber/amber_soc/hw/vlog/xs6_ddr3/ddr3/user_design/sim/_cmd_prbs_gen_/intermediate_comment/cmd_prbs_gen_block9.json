    "block_comment": "Unfortunately, the provided Verilog code seems to resume from a `generate` statement which doesn't seem to be included. It is necessary to see the portion an actual code segment which uses a `generate` construct to produce conditional structures or repeating structures based on parameters, etc. Without that information, it is difficult to provide you with a meaningful comment for this ending statement `endgenerate`. Could you please provide the complete block of code?"
