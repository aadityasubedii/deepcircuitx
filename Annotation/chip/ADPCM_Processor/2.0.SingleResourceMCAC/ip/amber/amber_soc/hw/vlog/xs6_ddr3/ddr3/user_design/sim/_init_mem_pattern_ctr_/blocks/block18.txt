Comment: 
The code block specifies logic rules for assigning value to the `FIXED_BL_VALUE` wire, based on the condition of `FAMILY` and `MEM_BURST_LEN` variables. It uses a multi-conditional ternary operator, which performs different calculations depending on the values of `FAMILY` and `MEM_BURST_LEN`. If `FAMILY` equals "VIRTEX6" and `MEM_BURST_LEN` equals either 8 or 0, `FIXED_BL_VALUE` is assigned a value of 2. If `FAMILY` equals "VIRTEX6" and `MEM_BURST_LEN` equals 4, `FIXED_BL_VALUE` is given a value of 1. Otherwise, `FIXED_BL_VALUE` is determined by the variable `FIXEDBL`.
