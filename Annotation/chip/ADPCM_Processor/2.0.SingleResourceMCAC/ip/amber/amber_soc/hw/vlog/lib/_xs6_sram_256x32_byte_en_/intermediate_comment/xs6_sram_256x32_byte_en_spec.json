    "spec": "Module name: xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en. \n\nModule specification: The xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en is a Verilog module that simulates a 256x32 byte-enabled Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) using the Block RAM primitive (RAMB8BWER) from the Xilinx design suite. It performs write and read operations based on signals synchronized with an input clock `i_clk`.\n\nIt has five input ports - `i_clk`, `i_write_data`, `i_write_enable`, `i_address`, and `i_byte_enable`. Here, `i_clk` is a clock signal for synchronization. `i_write_data` takes DATA_WIDTH from the source for writing operation, and this signal is controlled by write_enable signal `i_write_enable`. `i_address` specifies the destination address for read and write operations. `i_byte_enable` gives byte level control over write operations by allowing each byte to be individually written to.\n\nThe output port `o_read_data` presents the data read from SRAM when `i_write_enable` signal is low.\n\nInternally, the module uses a few signals like `nc31`, `nc32`, `nc33`, `nc22`, and `wea`. The signals `nc31` to `nc22` are possibly unused and may be remnants from a previous design or placeholders for potential future upgrades. The `wea` signal is employed as a byte-write enable for the Block RAM.\n\nThe code is comprised of a block that executes the read-write operations, and an initial block that checks if DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH conform to the module's requirements (32 and 8 respectively). Any discrepancy in these inputs will trigger a warning message. It assures efficient memory operations by using a bitwise AND between the global write-enable signal and individual byte enable signals for the Block RAM.",

With byte enable, finer control over write operations is facilitated. The input `i_byte_enable[3:0]` allows control over each byte of the 32-bit data such that each byte can be individually enabled/disabled for write. The parameters `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDRESS_WIDTH` set the width of the data and address bus. The SRAM is facilitated by using a Block RAM primitive `RAMB8BWER` in the Xilinx design suite. This module takes care of writing data (`i_write_data`) to the specified address (`i_address`) when write is enabled (`i_write_enable`). It also reads out data (`o_read_data`) from the specified address. The module also includes an initial block which checks the consistency of user-defined input parameters against the module's requirements."
