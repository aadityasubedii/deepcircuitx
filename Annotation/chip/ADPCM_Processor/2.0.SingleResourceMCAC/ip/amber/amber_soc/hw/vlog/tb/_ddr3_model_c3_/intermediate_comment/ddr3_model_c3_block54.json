    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to perform a timing check on the 12th DQS (Data Queue Strobe) signal line whenever a positive edge is detected. It achieves this function by utilizing an always block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the 12th DQS signal line. Once triggered, it calls the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function with the index 11 (Verilog uses 0-indexing) to perform the timing check on the specific DQS signal line. This implementation ensures that each signal line has its timing checked independently whenever a positive edge is detected on it."
