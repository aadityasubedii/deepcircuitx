    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module generates various data patterns for hardware testing, including fixed data, walking ones/zeros, sequential addresses, PRBS, and hammer patterns. It uses multiple internal registers and shift operations to create these patterns based on the selected data mode. The module supports different data widths and DQ pin configurations, with pattern generation controlled by input signals and internal counters. Output data is selected based on the current mode and configuration parameters.\n*/"
