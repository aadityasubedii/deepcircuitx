    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns the internal signal `mcb_wr_full_i` to the output `mcb_wr_full`. This simple operation essentially routes the internally generated signal `mcb_wr_full_i` to the outer environment through `mcb_wr_full`. This code can be used to inform the outside logic or higher level modules whether a memory controller buffer (MCB) write operation is full or not, assuming `mcb_wr_full_` is a flag indicating this condition. The functionality is achieved by direct assignment in continuous assignment statement form (`assign`)."
