This is an addressable register control block that configures the I/O Driver Control Register for non-terminating operation. It sets the 'Active_IODRP' to 'ZIO' and 'IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR' to 'NTerm' while setting the 'IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA' to 8 zeroes and 'IODRPCTRLR_R_WB' to 'WRITE_MODE' to write the configurations. The condition inside checks the 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' signal, if it is true, the block will keep the current 'STATE' as 'OFF_ZIO_NTERM', while if false, it will change the 'STATE' to 'WAIT8'.
