    "block_comment": "The line of Verilog code is an assignment statement that determines the boolean condition for the 'SetInvalidSymbol'. This is achieved by logically ANDing the values of 'MRxDV', 'MRxErr' and a comparison result between the 4-bit lower nibble of 'MRxD' and hexadecimal 'e'. The 'SetInvalidSymbol' signal becomes high when there is received data ('MRxDV' is high) and there is an error in the received data ('MRxErr' is high) and the lower four bits of the received data ('MRxD[3:0]') equals to hexadecimal 'e'."
