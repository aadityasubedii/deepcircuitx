    "block_comment": "This block initializes a first-in, first-out (FIFO) memory buffer, specifically an asynchronous FIFO, to hold commands. The buffer operates on a 38-bit data bus, supports 16 command entries, uses an asynchronous design, and requires a cycle time constant specified by 'TCQ'. Its read and write operations are managed by independent clocks 'clk_i'. Reset 'rst_ra[0]' is responsible for restarting the FIFO. Write-enable signal 'cmd_fifo_wr' and the data line '{cmd2flow_bl,cmd2flow_addr}' are used to write data into the buffer, and read-enable signal 'cmd_fifo_rd' and data output line '{xfer_cmd_bl,xfer_addr}' are used for reading. Flags 'cmd_fifo_full' and 'cmd_fifo_empty' indicate whether the BUF is full or empty, respectively."
