This block of code defines an Ethernet FIFO transmit buffer that can hold depth-size data with `ETH_TX_FIFO_DATA_WIDTH` bits per unit. It accommodates the channel interface towards the WISHBONE (WB) system employing control signals such as write (when MasterWbTX and m_wb_ack_i are active) and read (when ReadTxDataFromFifo_wb is active and TxBufferEmpty is not). Additionally, it includes status signals such as full, almost full, almost empty, and empty to monitor its operational state. TxFifoClear signal is used to reset the buffer. Furthermore, the block provides a current buffer fill level through the `txfifo_cnt` port.
