This block of code assigns input addresses and burst length to their respective output variables in a Read/Write memory system. Particularly, the 'wr_addr_o' and 'rd_addr_o' are assigned the same input address 'addr_i', indicating that both read and write operations are performed at the same location. Furthermore, the 'rd_bl_o' is assigned the input 'bl_i', which signifies the burst length for the read operation.
