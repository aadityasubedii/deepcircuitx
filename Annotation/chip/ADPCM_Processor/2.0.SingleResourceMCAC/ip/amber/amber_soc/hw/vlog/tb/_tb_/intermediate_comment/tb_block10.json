    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the loading of a boot memory from a predefined file for a non-Xilinx FPGA environment. It opens the desired boot memory file and reads each line in the file while counting them. If the file cannot be opened, it displays an error message and terminates the operation. For lines which do not start with a comment sign (//), it examines the first character for a format check. Any discrepancy leads to a format error and triggers an error message. Once it ensures line's legitimacy, it extracts the memory address and data, then converts them into 32-bit entities. These entities are inserted into the boot memory, and debug displays are generated if debug mode is on. After reading all lines, it displays the count of processed lines. Lastly, it sets a timeout value, specifies a core string depending on the system's core, displays information about the core, and opens a log file."
