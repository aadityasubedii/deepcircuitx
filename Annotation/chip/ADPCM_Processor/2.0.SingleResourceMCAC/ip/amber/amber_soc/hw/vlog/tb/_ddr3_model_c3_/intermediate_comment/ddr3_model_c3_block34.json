    "block_comment": "This block of code is in charge of executing the function `dqs_pos_timing_check(31)` during the negative edge of the signal `dqs_in[31]`. Essentially, this procedural block hinges upon an event-based procedure which assures the system's correctness by timing checks on the 32nd bit of the `dqs_in` signal, only when there is a transition from high (1) to low (0), i.e., the negative edge."
