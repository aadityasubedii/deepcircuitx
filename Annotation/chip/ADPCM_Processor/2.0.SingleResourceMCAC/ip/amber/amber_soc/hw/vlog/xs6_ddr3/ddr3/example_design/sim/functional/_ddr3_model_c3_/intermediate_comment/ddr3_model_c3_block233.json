    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to maintain a one clock cycle delay. It achieves this by assigning the value of the input clock signal `ck_in` to the `diff_ck` output on the positive edge of the `ck_in` signal. The `always` control flow is used to constantly monitor changes in the clock signal."
