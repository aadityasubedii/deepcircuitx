    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for maintaining the Write FIFO status in a memory controller block (MCB). It checks the FIFO count and resets or sets the FIFO write status flags accordingly. At every positive edge of the input clock (clk_i), if the reset signal (rst_ra[0]) is set, the write FIFO status flag (mcb_wr_full_r1) is reset. If the FIFO count (mcb_wr_fifo_counts) is greater than or equal to 63 (showing the FIFO is nearly full), both write FIFO status flags (mcb_wr_full_r1 and mcb_wr_full_r2) are set; otherwise, they are reset. The delay denoted by '#TCQ' allows changes to be propagated through the circuit with correct timing."
