This block of code implements a timing check function specifically designed for a data line at the 36th index. The line uses an 'always' keyword, which sets a condition to monitor the 36th index of the `dq_in` data line constantly. Whenever any changes are detected at the specified index, `dq_timing_check` function is triggered with '36' as its argument reflecting the index being monitored.
