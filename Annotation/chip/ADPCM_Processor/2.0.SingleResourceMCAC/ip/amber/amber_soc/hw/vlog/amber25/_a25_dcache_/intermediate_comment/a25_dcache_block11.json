    "block_comment": "The block of code is tasked with assigning a string description to the current state of a finite state machine (Function of the block). It achieves this by comparing the machine's current state, c_state, to predefined constant states, each carrying an associated string descriptor. The operation is implemented with a cascading ternary operator that sequentially checks each possible state and assigns the corresponding string. If c_state matches none of the defined states, it is assigned the string \"UNKNOWN\" (Implementation details of the block)."
