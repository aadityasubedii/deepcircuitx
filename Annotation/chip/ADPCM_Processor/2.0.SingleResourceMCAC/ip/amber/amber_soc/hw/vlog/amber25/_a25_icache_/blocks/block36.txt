The block of code is used to control the activation of a certain feature or operation in a digital system. It makes use of a logical AND operation (indicated by '&&') to generate an 'enable' signal. The 'enable' signal is active only when both 'i_select' and 'i_cache_enable' are high. Thus, both these signals need to be true for the 'enable' signal to be true, offering a level of control over the activation of the feature or operation the 'enable' is connected to in the larger digital system.
