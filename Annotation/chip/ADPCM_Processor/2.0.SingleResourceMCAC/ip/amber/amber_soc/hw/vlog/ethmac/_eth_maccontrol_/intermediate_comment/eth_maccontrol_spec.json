    "spec": "Module name: eth_maccontrol. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe eth_maccontrol module is a part of an Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) system, responsible primarily for managing control data flow during the transmission and reception of data. It interfaces with other components, including the transmit and receive control modules `eth_transmitcontrol` and `eth_receivecontrol`, performing latching and muxing operations for transmission data, handling pause and control frame functionalities. \n\nA number of input and output ports enable these operations. Input ports include clocks MTxClk and MRxClk, reset inputs TxReset and RxReset, pause request input TPauseRq, data and control inputs for transmission and reception operations, transmit and receive flow control signals TxFlow and RxFlow, MAC address input MAC, and others. These collectively control and steer the data flow and control signals in the MAC system. Output ports include data output for transmission TxDataOut, control signals regarding transmission status, padding and CRC operation indicators, control frame-related outputs, and a pause timer set signal SetPauseTimer. \n\nInternal signals used within the module help manage and coordinate its operations. These include signals to detect transmission status such as TxUsedDataOutDetected, latched versions of abort and done signals like TxAbortInLatched and TxDoneInLatched, and control signals like Pause, TxCtrlStartFrm, ControlData, CtrlMux, SendingCtrlFrm, and BlockTxDone. These signals operate collectively to lend control over data flow and processing within the module.\n\nThe Verilog RTL code for the module is organized in blocks, primarily including always blocks to manage state change of internal signals with respect to clock or reset signals, and assign blocks for declaring logic of output ports and internal signals. Two instances of other functional modules, `eth_receivecontrol` and `eth_transmitcontrol`, are also integrated within this module to carry out respective control functionalities.\n\nThe eth_maccontrol module forms an integral component of MAC operations by effectively managing control data flow and handling various control and state signals for transmission and reception processes.",

                    "text": "Module name: eth_maccontrol. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe eth_maccontrol module is a part of an Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) system, responsible primarily for managing control data flow during the transmission and reception of data. It interfaces with other components, including the transmit and receive control modules `eth_transmitcontrol` and `eth_receivecontrol`, performing latching and muxing operations for transmission data, handling pause and control frame functionalities. \n\nA number of input and output ports enable these operations. Input ports include clocks MTxClk and MRxClk, reset inputs TxReset and RxReset, pause request input TPauseRq, data and control inputs for transmission and reception operations, transmit and receive flow control signals TxFlow and RxFlow, MAC address input MAC, and others. These collectively control and steer the data flow and control signals in the MAC system. Output ports include data output for transmission TxDataOut, control signals regarding transmission status, padding and CRC operation indicators, control frame-related outputs, and a pause timer set signal SetPauseTimer. \n\nInternal signals used within the module help manage and coordinate its operations. These include signals to detect transmission status such as TxUsedDataOutDetected, latched versions of abort and done signals like TxAbortInLatched and TxDoneInLatched, and control signals like Pause, TxCtrlStartFrm, ControlData, CtrlMux, SendingCtrlFrm, and BlockTxDone. These signals operate collectively to lend control over data flow and processing within the module.\n\nThe Verilog RTL code for the module is organized in blocks, primarily including always blocks to manage state change of internal signals with respect to clock or reset signals, and assign blocks for declaring logic of output ports and internal signals. Two instances of other functional modules, `eth_receivecontrol` and `eth_transmitcontrol`, are also integrated within this module to carry out respective control functionalities.\n\nThe eth_maccontrol module forms an integral component of MAC operations by effectively managing control data flow and handling various control and state signals for transmission and reception processes."
