Comment: 
The function of the block is to manage the reset of the LSB of the RX Pointer register upon different conditions. On the implementation side, the code block gets called on the rising edge of either the WB Clock input (WB_CLK_I) or a Reset signal. If a Reset signal occurs, the LSB of the RX Pointer register is reset to 0. Similarly, if the 'MasterWbRX' and 'm_wb_ack_i' signals are both high, the LSB of the RX Pointer is reset. In contrast, if signals 'RxEn', 'RxEn_q' and 'RxPointerRead' are concurrently true, the LSB of the RX Pointer is loaded with the values present in the 2 LSB bits of 'ram_do'.
