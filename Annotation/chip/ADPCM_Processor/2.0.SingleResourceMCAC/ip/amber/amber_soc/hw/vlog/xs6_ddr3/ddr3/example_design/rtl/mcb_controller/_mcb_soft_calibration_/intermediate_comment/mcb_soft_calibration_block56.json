    "block_comment": "This block of code, labeled LOAD_RZQ_NTERM, controls the data entry for N-terminal resistance. It sets the I/O data register pointer (IODRP) to RZQ, validates the command to write to IODRP, sets the memory cell address to NTerm, and prepares data to be written (N_Term). The block of code then sets the mode to write. If the IODRP controller is ready for operation, the state remains at LOAD_RZQ_NTERM, otherwise, it transitions to the WAIT1 state. This block of code mainly controls the IODRP settings and the entry of N-terminal resistance data."
