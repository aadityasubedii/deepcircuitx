This block of code controls the synchronization of writing received data to a FIFO buffer. The synchronization is clocked on positive edge of WB_CLK_I or a positive edge reset. If the system goes into reset, the write process to the FIFO is halted immediately. Outside of the reset condition, the system checks the 'WriteRxDataToFifo' flag. If this flag is set, the data is written into the FIFO, otherwise, the write process is stalled to maintain input data integrity.
