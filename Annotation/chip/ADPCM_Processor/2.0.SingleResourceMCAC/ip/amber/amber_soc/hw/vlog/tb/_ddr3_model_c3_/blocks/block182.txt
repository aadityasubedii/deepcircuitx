The block of code performs the function of a positive edge detector for the 10th bit of the `dqs_odd` bus in a digital system. This is achieved with the use of an `always` construct which triggers effectively at the rising edge of the 10th bit of the `dqs_odd` bus. When the block detects the positive edge, it calls the function `dqs_odd_receiver` with '9' as an argument.
