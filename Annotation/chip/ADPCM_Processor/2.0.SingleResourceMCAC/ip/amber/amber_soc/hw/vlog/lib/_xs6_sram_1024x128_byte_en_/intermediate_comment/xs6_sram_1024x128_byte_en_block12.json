    "block_comment": "This block of code is configuring a dual-port RAM block (RAMB16BWER), commonly used in FPGA designs. The block works with 36-bit data widths for both of its ports. The block enables synchronous reset (\"SYNC\"), with priority given to Clock Enable (CE). Write operations are configured to be \"Write First\" for A and B interfaces. It doesn't use external initialization files, instead it assigns memory initialization values by setting the 'INIT_xx' parameters to the respective pre-defined 'SRAM0_INIT_xx' values. The reset values for both ports A and B are set to zero, defined by 'SRVAL_A' and 'SRVAL_B'."
