    "block_comment": "This block manages the mode of self-refresh in a memory controller within a certain clock cycle. By monitoring the user interface clock (UI_CLK), it sets the SELFREFRESH_MODE to low upon reset (RST) for initialization. It sets SELFREFRESH_MODE to high if SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE_R2 is active, indicating that the memory controller needs to be in self-refresh mode. When the system temperature reaches an optimal level (WarmEnough), the block switches off the self-refresh mode to conserve power."
