    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for receiving data on the 10th channel of the `dqs_odd` array. The mechanism of its operation is based on triggering on the positive edge of the 10th signal of `dqs_odd`. Upon this triggering, the `dqs_odd_receiver(9)` function is called, carrying out the necessary operations associated with receiving data on this 10th channel."
