    "block_comment": "This block of code compares read and expected data for error detection. It operates on rising edge of input clock (clk_i). If the compare data enable (cmp_data_en) signal is ON, it slices read data (rd_data_r) and compare data (cmp_data_r), down to half data width (DWIDTH/2) for lower and upper halves separately, and compares them. If any errors are discovered, data error flag (data_error) signals get set with a certain delay (#TCQ). An error message is displayed if data_error is asserted showcasing the expected and received data along with the time of occurrence. If cmp_data_en is OFF, data error flags stay at 0 irrespectively, keeping the code safe from unknown data errors."
