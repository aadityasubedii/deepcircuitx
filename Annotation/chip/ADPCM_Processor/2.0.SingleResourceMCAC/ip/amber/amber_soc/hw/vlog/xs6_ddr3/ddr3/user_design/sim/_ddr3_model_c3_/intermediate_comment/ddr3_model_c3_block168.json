    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for implementing a timing check on command addresses whenever there's a change in the input signal named 'we_n_in'. It achieves this by calling the function 'cmd_addr_timing_check' with the parameter of '3' whenever 'we_n_in' changes state. This function likely takes the parameter '3' to mean some kind of timing constraint or specification for the check."
