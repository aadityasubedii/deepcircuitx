Module-level comment: The iodrp_mcb_controller module implements a DRP controller for memory blocks, orchestrating read/write operations and phasing transitions. It uses input signals to capture command validity, addresses, and data, while output signals indicate read data, readiness, and DRP interface states. Internal registers hold temporary address and data, and drive operations with an FSM. Key tasks perform data shifting and expansion, while sequential logic in always blocks manage data flow and state transitions. Features like selectable broadcast mode and user-induced read commands are also supported.
