    "block_comment": "The block of code designates that the \"end_addr_reached\" signal turns high when certain conditions are met based on the system configuration. Implementation-wise, upon every positive edge of the clock signal, the block checks whether both the \"upper_end_matched\" and \"lower_end_matched\" signals are high. Additionally, it checks for specific FPGA family types (\"SPARTAN6\", \"VIRTEX6\") and data width (DWIDTH) settings (32, 64, or 128 bits). If these conditions are met, the \"end_addr_reached\" signal is set to '1', else it remains at '0'."
