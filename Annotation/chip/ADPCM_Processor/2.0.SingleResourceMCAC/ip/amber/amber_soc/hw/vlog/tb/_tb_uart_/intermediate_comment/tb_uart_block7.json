    "block_comment": "This block checks if a transmit FIFO buffer is empty. It does this by comparing the write pointer (txfifo_wp) and the read pointer (txfifo_rp) of the transmit FIFO. If they are equal, the FIFO is empty and the resultant 'txfifo_empty' signal is set to high denoting an empty buffer; otherwise, the signal indicates that the FIFO is not empty."
