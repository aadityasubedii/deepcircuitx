    "block_comment": "This block assigns specific state names to the `xAS_STATE` parameter depending on the current state of the `wishbone_st` parameter. It makes use of conditional operations in Verilog for this purpose. If `wishbone_st` is in `WB_IDLE` state, `xAS_STATE` will be assigned \"WB_IDLE\". Similarly, for `WB_BURST1`, `WB_BURST2`, `WB_BURST3`, and `WB_WAIT_ACK` states, respective string state names will be assigned to `xAS_STATE`. If `wishbone_st` doesn't match any of these states, \"UNKNOWN\" will be assigned. This is a high-level reflection of the system's state-machine, depicting the active operating state."
