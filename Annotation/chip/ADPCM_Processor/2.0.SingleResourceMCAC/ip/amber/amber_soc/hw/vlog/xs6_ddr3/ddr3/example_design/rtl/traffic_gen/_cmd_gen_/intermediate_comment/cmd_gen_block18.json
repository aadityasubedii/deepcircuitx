    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for generating a fixed address based on the command pattern and the data width (DWIDTH). The implementation is an if-else conditional statement inside a generate loop. If command pattern matches either \"CGEN_FIXED\" or \"CGEN_ALL\", fixed address is generated by concatenating the input `fixed_addr_i` with specific bit values. Depending upon the data width, different bits of `fixed_addr_i` are fetched and zero bits are appended to the LSBs. For example, if DWIDTH is 32, bits 31:2 of `fixed_addr_i` are concatenated with 2'b0. This pattern repeats for different ranges of DWITH values."
