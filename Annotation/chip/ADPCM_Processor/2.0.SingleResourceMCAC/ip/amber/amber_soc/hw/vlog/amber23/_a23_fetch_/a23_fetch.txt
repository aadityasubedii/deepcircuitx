Module-level comment: The a23_fetch module controls operations between cache memory and the Wishbone bus. It decides where to read/write data based on cacheability, validity of the address, cache enable signal, and other factors. It uses internal selection signals (sel_cache, sel_wb) driven by these factors and stall signals (cache_stall, wb_stall) to track the busyness of the cache/Wishbone bus, managing data read/write accordingly. It handles different operational modes, byte-wise operations, cache control, and system readiness. Two sub-modules, a23_cache and a23_wishbone, encapsulate cache and Wishbone operations respectively.
