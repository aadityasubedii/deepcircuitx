    "module": "Module-level comment: The a23_barrel_shift_fpga module is designed to perform various types of barrel shift operations: LSL, LSR, ASR, and ROR. Inputs dictate the 32-bit data, operation type, shift amount, and carry in status. The module generates corresponding output data and carry out status. Internally, it uses various signals and masks to carry out these operations while routers direct data flow. Conditions based on inputs modify the behavior of shifts. The module implements bitwise operations, loops, conditionals, and functions wrapped and bit_swap to achieve this functionality. It is a highly configurable design adaptable to various shifting needs."
