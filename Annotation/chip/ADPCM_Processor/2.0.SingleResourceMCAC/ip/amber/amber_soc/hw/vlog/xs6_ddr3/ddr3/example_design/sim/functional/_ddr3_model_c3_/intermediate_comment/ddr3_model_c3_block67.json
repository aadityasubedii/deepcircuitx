    "block_comment": "This block of code calls a function `dq_timing_check` whenever there is a change in the 64th bit of `dq_in` variable. Specifically, in Verilog, it employs the `always @` system task, which creates a sensitivity list containing signal `dq_in[63]`. Every time there is a transition in the state of `dq_in[63]`, the `dq_timing_check` function is executed with the input parameter set to `63`. It enables the program to closely monitor the most significant bit (64th bit) of the variable `dq_in` and perform timing checks accordingly."
