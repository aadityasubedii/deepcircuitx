    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for the interface between the AXI memory controller block (MCB) and the system. By using two instances of the `mcb_ui_top_synch` and `axi_mcb` modules, it ensures synchronization and memory operations. `mcb_ui_top_synch` receives an 'uo_done_cal' input signal and provides a 'calib_done_synch' output signal upon completion of synchronization, using a clock signal 's5_axi_aclk'. `axi_mcb`, configured for a Spartan-6 device, deals with memory transactions. It accepts AXI-based read/write requests and other signals such as address, data, IDs, and returns the response status and data. The block also interfaces with MCB-specific signals for memory commands and write operations."
