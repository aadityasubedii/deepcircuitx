    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a synchronous logic that is updated either on the positive edge of the 'MTxClk' clock signal or when a 'Reset' is initiated. On a reset, the signal 'MTxEn' is de-asserted after a delay of '#Tp' units. Otherwise, 'MTxEn' is assigned based on the logical-OR operation between 'StatePreamble', any bit 'StateData', 'StatePAD', 'StateFCS', and 'StateJam' signals after a delay of '#Tp' units."
