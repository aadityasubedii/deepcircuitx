    "block_comment": "This block of code instantiates an OBUFT (Output Buffer with Three-state control) for the RAS signal associated with the memory controller block. It uses the OBUFT primitive iob_ras to facilitate the driving of the mcbx_dram_ras_n signal. The .O represents the output, the .I represents the data input, and the .T represents the output enable. The instance iob_ras drives the output mcbx_dram_ras_n, takes the input from ioi_ras, and is controlled by t_ras."
