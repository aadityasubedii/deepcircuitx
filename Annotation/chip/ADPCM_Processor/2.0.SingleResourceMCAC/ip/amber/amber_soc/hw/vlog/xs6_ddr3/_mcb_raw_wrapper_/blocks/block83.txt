The block manages the system's self refresh functionality flags across multiple clock cycles. It performs this by detecting rising edges on the user interface clock. On system reset, it clears the self refresh enter flip-flops. If not in reset, it advances the state of self refresh transition over the next three consecutive rising edges of the user interface clock, creating a pipeline functionality.
