This task 'wshift' handles selecting the type of shift operation and printing shift instruction with its constant operand, if there is. First, it checks whether the shift operation is not a logical left shift (LSL) or if the shift immediate is not zero. If either of these conditions holds true, a case operation interprets the shift operation type encoded in bits 6:5 of the 'execute_instruction', choosing between logical left shift (LSL), logical right shift (LSR), arithmetic right shift (ASR), or rotate right (RRX/ROR); and then writes that to a file. If the operation is rotate right selection and the 'shift_imm' is not zero, it specifies 'ROR' not 'RRX'. After that, unless the operation chosen is rotate right (RRX/ROR) with zero operand, the task also prints the constant shift amount.
