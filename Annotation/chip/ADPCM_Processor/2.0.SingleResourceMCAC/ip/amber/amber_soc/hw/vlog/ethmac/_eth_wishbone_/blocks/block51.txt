Comment: 
This block of code covers the control of the "LastByteIn" signal in an asynchronous communication receiver. Upon each rising edge of the MRxClk or Reset signals, the "LastByteIn" signal is managed based on the state of internal control signals. When Reset is high, "LastByteIn" is immediately cleared. Else, if the shift operation is ending (as indicated by "ShiftWillEnd"); the receiver byte counter, "RxByteCnt", is a value where all bits are active; or an abort command, "RxAbort", is signaled, "LastByteIn" is cleared. Finally, when all the conditions 'data reception validation ("RxValid"), receiver readiness ("RxReady"), data frame end identifier ("RxEndFrm"), and enable reception window ("RxEnableWindow") are active', and "RxByteCnt" doesn't have all bits active, "LastByteIn" is activated, implying successful receipt of the final data byte in the that window.
