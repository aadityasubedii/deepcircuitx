    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for triggering a negative edge detection function, called `dqs_neg_timing_check`, whenever there's a falling edge in the `dqs_in[0]` signal. By using the keyword `always` and the sensitivity list `@(negedge dqs_in[0])`, the code efficiently checks for a 1-to-0 transition in the `dqs_in[0]` signal and executes the function `dqs_neg_timing_check(0)` when this occurs.\n"
