Comment: 
This block of code is functionally a byte counter in a serial communication system. It resets or increments the counter 'ByteCnt' based on certain conditions. The counter is set to zero during a system reset (RxReset) or a manual byte count reset (ResetByteCnt). Alternatively, the ByteCnt is set to increment by one, executed on each positive edge of the master clock 'MRxClk' when the condition 'IncrementByteCnt' is enabled. The delay before reset or increment operation is observed using '#Tp', making it synchronous design.
