The function of the block is to perform synchronous reset. This block regulates the synchronization of the RxStatusWriteLatched signals. When reset, both `RxStatusWriteLatched_sync1` and `RxStatusWriteLatched_sync2` are set to false. Alternatively, if not reset, `RxStatusWriteLatched_sync1` acquires the value of `RxStatusWriteLatched` and `RxStatusWriteLatched_sync2` takes the previously acquired value of `RxStatusWriteLatched_sync1`, thereby ensuring consistency. This process results in a one clock cycle delay.
