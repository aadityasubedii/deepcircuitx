The module is responsible for setting up the system configuration, including system clock, memory addressing, and real-time interaction with various hardware peripherals. The module also manages initializing and loading data into primary (boot) and secondary (main) memory if such files are defined. It also sets up various test modules and handles test outcomes, including printing register values, and test results. Further, it is responsible for managing system resets. This appears to be a fairly complete system-level test environment primarily targeted for a FPGA such as Xilinx Virtex or Spartan."
