    "block_comment": "This block of code is a write operation function on data words. It employs a technique called byte masking to selectively write to specific parts of the data word based on the value of `i_byte_enable`. If `i_byte_enable` equals a certain binary value, it will concatenate the `i_write_data` and `o_read_data` in a certain way. Particularly, only the bytes for which the corresponding bit in `i_byte_enable` is set are updated from `i_write_data`, while the rest are preserved from `o_read_data`. In case the `i_byte_enable` doesn't match with the predefined values, the entire 32-bits of `i_write_data` are assigned to `write_data_word` as is."
