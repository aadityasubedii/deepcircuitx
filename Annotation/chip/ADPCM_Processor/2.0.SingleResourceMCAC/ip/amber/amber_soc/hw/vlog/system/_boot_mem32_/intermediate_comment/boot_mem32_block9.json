    "block_comment": "The given block of code controls the state of the 'start_read_r' register in a synchronous manner with respect to the rising edge of the 'i_wb_clk' clock signal. This 'start_read_r' is used to initiate the read operations. The code dictates that upon receiving a 'start_read' signal, a 4-bit shift register is filled in with 3 leading zeroes followed by a 'start_read'. Conversely, if an 'o_wb_ack' acknowledge signal is received, the 'start_read_r' register is set back to a 4-bit zero. Otherwise, it performs a shift-left operation with the last bit being filled with the next 'start_read' signal."
