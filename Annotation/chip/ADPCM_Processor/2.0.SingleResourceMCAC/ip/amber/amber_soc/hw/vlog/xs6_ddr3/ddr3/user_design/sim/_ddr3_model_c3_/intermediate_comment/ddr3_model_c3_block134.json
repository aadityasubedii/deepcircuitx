    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code instantiates a sensitivity event on the change of the 14th bit (index 13) of the input data multiplexer (dm_in). Whenever the 14th bit of dm_in changes, the function 'dm_timing_check' with the parameter 13 is invoked, ensuring appropriate action is taken after this change."
