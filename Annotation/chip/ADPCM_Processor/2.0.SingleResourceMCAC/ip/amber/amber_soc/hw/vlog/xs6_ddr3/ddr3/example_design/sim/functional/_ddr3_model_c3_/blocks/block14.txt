This is a clocked always block that handles the timing check for negative edge of the DQS signal on the 18th bit. Whenever the positive edge of the dqs_in signal on bit 18 is detected, the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function for the 18th bit is triggered. This function checks if the data has been read or written at the correct time, ensuring the data integrity during signal transmission.
