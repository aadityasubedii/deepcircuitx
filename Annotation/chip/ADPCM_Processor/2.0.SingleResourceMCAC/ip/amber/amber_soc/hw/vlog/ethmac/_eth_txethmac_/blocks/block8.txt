Comment: 
This Verilog block is primarily responsible for dealing with reset conditions and error detection. When a positive edge of either MTxClk or Reset is detected, it activates. If the system is undergoing a reset, it ensures that the MTxErr signal is de-asserted after a delay of Tp units. If the system is not in a reset condition, then MTxErr is set if a 'TooBig' or 'UnderRun' error condition has been detected, again after a Tp unit delay.
