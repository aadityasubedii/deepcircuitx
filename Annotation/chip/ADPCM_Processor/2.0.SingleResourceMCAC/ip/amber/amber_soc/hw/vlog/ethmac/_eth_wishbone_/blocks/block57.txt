Comment: 
The block handles a read pointer (RxPointerRead) for a receiver module in a synchronous system. At every rising edge of the system clock (WB_CLK_I) or a reset event, the read pointer is set to '0' upon reset or if both RxEn & RxEn_q signals are high. Alternatively, the pointer is set to '1' when the StartRxPointerRead command is active. The '#Tp' delay models the propagation delay of the circuit.
