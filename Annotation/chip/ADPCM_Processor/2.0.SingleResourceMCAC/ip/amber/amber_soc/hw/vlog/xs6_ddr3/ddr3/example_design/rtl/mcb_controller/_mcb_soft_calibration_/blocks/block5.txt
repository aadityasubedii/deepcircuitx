This block of Verilog code is used to increment a delay if certain conditions are met. It operates through a case statement which responds based on the value of the Inc_Dec_REFRSH_Flag. In general, this block transitions the state to START_DYN_CAL and keeps certain flags like MCB_UILDQSINC, MCB_UIUDQSINC, MCB_UILDQSDEC, and MCB_UIUDQSDEC deactivated. If the Inc_Dec_REFRSH_Flag is at '101', it increments the 'counter_inc' and activates the MCB_UILDQSINC and MCB_UIUDQSINC flags when the 'DQS_DELAY' is less than the upper limit and 'counter_inc' is equal to or greater than 4. For '100', it merely keeps the state at 'INCREMENT' if the delay is less than the upper limit.
