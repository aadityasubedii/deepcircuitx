    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is used to monitor timing violations for On-Die Termination (ODT). It watches for tIH (input hold time) and tIPW (input pulse width) timing violations. It does this by continuously examining the signal 'odt_in'. If the system is not in reset, ODT is enabled, and the system is not in self-refresh mode, the block checks if the time since 'tm_ck_pos' is less than TIH or the time since 'tm_odt' is less than TIPW. If either of these violations occurs, the block generates an error message. This block also updates 'tm_odt' with the current time at the end of every input event."
