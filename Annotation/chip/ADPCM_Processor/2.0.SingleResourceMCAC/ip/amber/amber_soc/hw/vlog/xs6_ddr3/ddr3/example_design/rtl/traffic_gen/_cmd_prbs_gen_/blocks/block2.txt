Comment: 
The block generates a pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) from a linear feedback shift register's (LFSR) output. It selectively concatenates bits from the LFSR state (`lfsr_q`) and the zero bitstring (`ZEROS`), with bits [SEED_WIDTH -1:7] taken from `ZEROS` and bits [6:1] taken from `lfsr_q`.
