Comment: 
This block of Verilog code represents a synchronous flip-flop circuit block which is sensitive to the positive edge of WB_CLK_I clock signal and Reset signal. If the Reset signal is high, the flip-flop is reset and the `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync3` output is set to 0. Otherwise, it takes the value of `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync2` with a delay of Tp. In essence the design exhibits synchronous reset behaviour and the register value is fetched from `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync2`.
