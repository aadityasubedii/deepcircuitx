    "block_comment": "This code block implements configuration and condition controls for a memory interface generator (MIG) with several data and control signals. If the settings for C_PORT_CONFIG match \"B32\" and \"R32\" and if the port is enabled (C_PORT_ENABLE[2] is 1), the MIG port 2 associated signals (like 'mig_p2_rd_data', 'mig_p2_overflow', etc.) are assigned with corresponding 'p2_rd' signals. If the port is not enabled, all these signals are forcefully assigned to zero. The write permissions and related signals for MIG port 2 are always assigned to zero, indicating no write operations are permitted under this configuration."
