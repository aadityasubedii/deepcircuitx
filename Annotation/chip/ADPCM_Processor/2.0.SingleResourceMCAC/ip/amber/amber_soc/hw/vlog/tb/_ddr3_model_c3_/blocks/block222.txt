The function 'get_index' checks if an input address is used in the memory. If found, it returns '1', otherwise it returns '0'. Initially 'get_index' is set to '0'. Then it iterates over all used memory addresses. If a match is found, 'get_index' is assigned '1', the loop is terminated prematurely using the 'disable' keyword.
