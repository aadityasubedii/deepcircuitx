Comment: 
This block is in charge of managing the transmission pointer (TxPointerMSB) in a write buffer system. The block responds to a rising edge clock signal or a system reset, thus ensuring synchronization. When a reset signal is encountered, the transmission pointer is initialized to zero. If the transmission enable signal is active and the block is not currently reading from the transmission pointer, then the data output from the RAM is assigned to the transmission pointer. Alternatively, if the signal to increment the transmission pointer is active and the signal to prevent incrementing is not active, the system increments the transmission pointer, helping in queue management.
