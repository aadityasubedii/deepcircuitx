    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the control signals associated with transmit interrupts in a Verilog UART model. At each rising edge of the system clock, it checks conditions to set 'tx_interrupt' signal. Initially, it checks if 'wb_start_write' is high and an address equals a specific UART ICR value, then it clears the 'tx_interrupt' signal. If 'wb_start_write' isn't high and 'fifo_enable' is active, 'tx_interrupt' is set when the transmit FIFO is half or less than half full and a certain UART control register bit is high. If 'fifo_enable' isn't active, 'tx_interrupt' is set when the transmit FIFO is empty and the given UART control register bit is high.\n"
