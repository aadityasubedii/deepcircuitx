    "block_comment": "This block of code in the Verilog hardware description language handles the command readiness signal (`cmd_rdyF`) in a synchronous system, i.e., upon each positive edge of the clock signal (`clk_i`). In case of a reset signal (`rst_i[0]`), the readiness signal is set high after a delay of `#TCQ`. If the command start flag (`cmd_startF`) is high and the `bl_i` signal is 1, the readiness signal is also set to high with the same delay. In any other conditions except when the user burst count (`user_burst_cnt`) is 2 and the FIFO is not full, the readiness signal is pulled low with the `#TCQ` delay. Finally, if `user_burst_cnt` equals 2 and the FIFO is indeed not full, the readiness signal is set to high."
