This block of code generates or alters a data word (w1data) depending on the input conditions. It responds to a clock edge and either fifo_rdy_i or cmd_startC must be true. Initially, if cmd_startC is true and if sel_w1gen_logic is true it inspects the fields 8:5 of addr_i. Depending on the specific value of these fields, it either calls Data_Gen or Data_GenW0 with the value of the fields as parameter provided that data_mode_i is 4'b0101. If data_mode_i is not 4'b0101 then only Data_GenW0 is called. If the value field does not match any case then w1data assigned with zeroes. If cmd_startC is not true but MEM_BURST_LEN is 8, it calculates w1data based on shifting and merging the existing values of w1data.
