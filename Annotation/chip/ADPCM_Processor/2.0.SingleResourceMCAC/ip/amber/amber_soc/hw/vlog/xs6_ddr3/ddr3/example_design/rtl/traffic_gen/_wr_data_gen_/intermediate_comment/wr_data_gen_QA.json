This is implemented separately for different families of FPGA technology i.e. SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. The module handles various conditions like if the mentioned family is SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6, managing commands and write data accordingly. The module checks the fullness of the FIFO (First In, First Out) queue using 'fifo_not_full' signals. Moreover, the 'wr_data_gen' module governs the write operations by managing the burst counts and ensuring the readiness of the command line, besides managing the data validities. It invokes the respective data generator ('sp6_data_gen' or 'v6_data_gen') based on the FPGA family mentioned in the parameters."
