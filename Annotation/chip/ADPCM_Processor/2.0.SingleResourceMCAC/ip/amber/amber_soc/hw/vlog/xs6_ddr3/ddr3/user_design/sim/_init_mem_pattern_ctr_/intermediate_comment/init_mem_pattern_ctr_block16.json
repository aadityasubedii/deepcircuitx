    "block_comment": "This block handles boundary checks for a given address. Specifically, this block is designed to compare the lower 8 bits of the `current_address` to the `end_boundary_addr`. The comparison occurs at every rising edge of the input clock signal (`clk_i`). If the lower 8 bits of the `current_address` is greater than or equal to `end_boundary_addr`, the flag `lower_end_matched` is set to 1 (true). If the condition is not met, `lower_end_matched` is set to 0 (false)."
