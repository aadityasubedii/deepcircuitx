    "block_comment": "This block handles the end conditions for a transmitting operation in a hardware design. On every positive edge of MtxClk or a reset condition, it sets the TxEndFrm flag which indicates the end of transmission. It considers several scenarios - the reset condition resets the TxEndFrm to false; If Flop is true and.TxEndFrm, TxAbort, or TxRetry_q is true, it also resets TxEndFrm. However, if Flop is true and it's the last word of the transmission, it checks the number of valid latched bytes (TxValidBytesLatched). According to the byte counter (TxByteCnt), it sets TxEndFrm to true when it reaches the last valid byte. If none of these conditions are met, it sets TxEndFrm to false."
