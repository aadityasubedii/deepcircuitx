    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the output wire 'o_wb_err' a constant value of 0. Implemented with an assign statement, this block suggests that under normal conditions, there are no errors ('o_wb_err' = 0) in the Wishbone interface. The '1'd0' literal confirms that 'o_wb_err' is a 1-bit wide signal."
