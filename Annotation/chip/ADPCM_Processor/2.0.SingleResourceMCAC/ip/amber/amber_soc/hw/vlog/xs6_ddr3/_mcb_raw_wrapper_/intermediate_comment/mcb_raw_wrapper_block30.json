    "block_comment": "This code block functions as a clock divider, meant to divide the frequency of an incoming clock signal by a factor of 10. It's implemented using a simple binary counter that increments on each clock cycle. When the counter reaches the count of 10, it resets to zero and toggles an output signal, creating an effective clock signal that is only a tenth the frequency of the original."
