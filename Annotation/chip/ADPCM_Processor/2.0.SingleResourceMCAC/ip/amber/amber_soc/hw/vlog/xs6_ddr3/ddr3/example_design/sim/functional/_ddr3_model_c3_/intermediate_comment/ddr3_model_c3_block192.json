    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a task `dqs_odd_receiver` that handles the reception of DQS signal in a DDR interface with odd interval. The task accepts a 4-bit integer input `i` and uses it to compute a bitmask. If the `i`-th bit of `dqs_odd` is set, the task then performs selective data masking based on the `tdqs_en` flag. If `tdqs_en` is high, it sets the `i`-th bit of `dm_in_neg` to zero otherwise it assigns `dm_in[i]` to `dm_in_neg[i]`. Finally, it updates `dq_in_neg` by performing bitwise-and with the generated `bit_mask` and `dq_in` and combining it with the bitwise-and of `dq_in_neg` and the bitwise-not of `bit_mask`."
