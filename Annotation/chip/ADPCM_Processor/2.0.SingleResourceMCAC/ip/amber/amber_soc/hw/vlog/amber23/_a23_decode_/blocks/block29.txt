Comment: 
This module determines the next interrupt status for a processor. It uses a priority-based system to decide, prioritizing 'dabt_request' over 'firq_request' over 'irq_request' and so on. The result is then mapped to a 3-bit value from 1 to 7 with 'dabt_request' as the highest and 'swi_request' as the lowest priority; if none of the conditions are true, it defaults to a value of 0 for no interrupt.
