    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block manages data pushing and popping for a receive First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue associated with UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) communication. The FIFO queue is signaled to pop when a Wishbone 'read' operation starts and the targeted address matches the AMBER_UART_DR. Data is allowed to push into the FIFO only when it is not full, denoted by 'rx_fifo_push_not_full'. Similarly, the FIFO can be popped when it isn't empty, indicated by 'rx_fifo_pop_not_empty'. The status 'rx_fifo_half_or_more' indicates if the FIFO contains half or more than its total capacity of data."
