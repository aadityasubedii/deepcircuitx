    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to generate a reset signal specifically for the DDR3 memory type. The generation is conditionally based on the `C_MEM_TYPE` parameter. If this parameter equals \"DDR3\", an `OBUFT` (Output Buffer with 3-state control) instance named `iob_rst` is created. This instance directs the `ioi_rst` input to the `mcbx_dram_ddr3_rst` output through a tri-state buffer controlled by `t_rst`. This implementation detail ensures the reset signal is properly managed and applied to the DDR3 memory component."
