    "block_comment": "This block functions as a conditional logging unit for a jump operation in a Verilog synthesis processing unit. The Verilog block is triggered at the positive edge of i_clk. The block writes a detailed log of a jump operation when there is no fetch stall, and an instruction is being executed that is not an interrupt or undefined software interrupt and involves a non-zero execute address. It creates the log by writing critical information to a file named 'decompile_file'. This information includes the clock count, initial and destination addresses of the jump, and values of the first two registers (r0 and r1). It's designed to give insight into operations at moments when the program counter selection is non-zero and the program counter write-enable is active."
