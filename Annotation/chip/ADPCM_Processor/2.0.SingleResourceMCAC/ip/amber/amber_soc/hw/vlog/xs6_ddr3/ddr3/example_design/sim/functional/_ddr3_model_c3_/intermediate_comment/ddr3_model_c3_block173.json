    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code monitors signal transitions with respect to specific timing constraints. If a signal transition happens before the defined time interval (either `tIH` or `tIPW`), an error message is displayed. This is achieved by continuously monitoring `odt_in` for event changes. When `rst_n_in && odt_en && !in_self_refresh` is logically true, the timing from the last clock positive edge (`tm_ck_pos`) and the last ODT signal (`tm_odt`) is calculated. If the time elapsed since these events is less than `tIH` or `tIPW` respectively, an error is logged indicating a violation of the timing constraints."
