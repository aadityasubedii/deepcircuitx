The block is a register that responds to either a rising clock edge (WB_CLK_I) or a reset signal (Reset). On reset conditions, the block sets the TxDone_wb signal to 0 with a propagation delay (Tp), essentially initializing this signal. In the case of a clock edge, the block updates TxDone_wb signal value with the value of TxDoneSync1 signal after a delay of Tp. The purpose of this block is to synchronize the TxDone_wb signal with the system clock and provide a mechanism to reset the signal.
