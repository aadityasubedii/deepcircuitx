    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code defines a function 'get_rtt_wr' that determines the division result between a predefined Impedance (RZQ) value and the 3-bit input 'rtt' with the least significant being hard-coded as '0'. The function works by concatenating its 3-bit 'rtt' input with a least significant hard-coded bit of '0', then dividing the Impedance value by this resulting bit pattern."
