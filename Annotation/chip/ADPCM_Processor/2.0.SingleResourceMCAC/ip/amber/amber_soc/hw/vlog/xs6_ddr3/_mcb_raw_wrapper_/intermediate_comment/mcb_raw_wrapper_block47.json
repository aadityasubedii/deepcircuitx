    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for initialization. It sets various registers and signals related to the command and data interfaces to a memory controller (MIG) and processor interfaces to the low (0) state. Specifically, it controls command execution, arbitration enablement, address, block length, fullness, and error state of command queues, data write operations including data and mask, read operations including data, counter, overflow, error state and fullness of read queue. Additionally, it designated some signals for enabling and clock signals for processor interfaces and memory controller. The assignment to 'b0 resets or nullifies these signals in preparation for further operations."
