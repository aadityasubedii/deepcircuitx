    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially responsible for implementing a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) based pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) generator. To achieve this, the `always` function is triggered whenever there's an event or change in `lfsr_q[32:1]`. Consequently, the resultant PRBS bit sequence gets assigned to the `prbs` variable from the 32nd to the 1st bit of `lfsr_q[32:1]`. This produces a pseudo-random sequence determined by the changing states of `lfsr_q[32:1]`."
