    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the readiness status of a command, denoted by 'cmd_rdyB'. On each positive edge of the input clock signal 'clk_i', the code checks for certain conditions and updates 'cmd_rdyB' accordingly. If the first bit of the input reset signal 'rst_i' is high, 'cmd_rdyB' is set to 1. If 'cmd_startB' is true and the block length 'bl_i' is 1, 'cmd_rdyB' is also set to 1, otherwise, it's set to zero. Finally, 'cmd_rdyB' is also set to 1 if the user burst count 'user_burst_cnt' is 2 and the FIFO is not full, denoted by 'fifo_not_full'."
