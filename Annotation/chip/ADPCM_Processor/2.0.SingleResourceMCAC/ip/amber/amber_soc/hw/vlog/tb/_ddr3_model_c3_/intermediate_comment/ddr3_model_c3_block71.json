    "block_comment": "The block triggers a timing check for data queue (dq) input bit [59] whenever there's a change in its state. The 'always @' construct in Verilog schedules the execution of an event or block of code, in this case the 'dq_timing_check' function, which is executed whenever the dq_in[59] bit changes. The '(59)' argument specifies the bit index for which this particular timing check is validated."
