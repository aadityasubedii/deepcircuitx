This block of code is responsible for calculating the available buffer size in a FIFO (First In, First Out) memory design. Within the block, `buf_avail` is assigned a value that deducts the current write pointer `wr_ptr` from the sum of `rd_capture_ptr` and `FIFO_DEPTH`, where `rd_capture_ptr` is the read capture pointer, and `FIFO_DEPTH` signifies the maximum depth or size of the FIFO buffer. This calculation essentially indicates how much space is left in the FIFO buffer by accounting for the portion already filled (tracked by write pointer) from the total size.
