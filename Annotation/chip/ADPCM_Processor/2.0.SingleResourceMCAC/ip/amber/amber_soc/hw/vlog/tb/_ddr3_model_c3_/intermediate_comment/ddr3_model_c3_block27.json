    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is designed to perform a timing check on a specific signal. It utilizes a locally defined function, `dqs_neg_timing_check()`, which is executed whenever there's a negative edge detected on the 6th bit of the `dqs_in` signal. Thus, the purpose of this block is to continuously monitor the 6th bit of this signal and call the timing check function whenever a falling edge event occurs."
