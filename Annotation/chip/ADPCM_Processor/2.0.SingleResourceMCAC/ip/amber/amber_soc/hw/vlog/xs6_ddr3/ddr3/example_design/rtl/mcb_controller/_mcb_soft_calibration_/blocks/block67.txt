Comment: 
This block of code controls the `WaitCountEnable` signal in a synchronous operation upon the rising edge of `UI_CLK`. The block sets `WaitCountEnable` to zero when a reset (`RST`) is detected or when the property of self-refresh (`SELFREFRESH_REQ_R1`) is enabled and not in a ready state (`~SELFREFRESH_REQ_R2`). The block enables `WaitCountEnable` to start the dynamic calibration (`PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH_R1`) only when `PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH` is zero. In other cases, the current state of `WaitCountEnable` is retained.
