    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for interfacing with the 6th slave in a Wishbone communication protocol. The code assigns the master's address, data, and selection lines to the 6th slave's corresponding lines. The write enable, cycle, and strobe signals for the 6th slave are controlled by checks against the 'current_slave' variable. If the 'current_slave' is set to 4'd6, which uniquely identifies the 6th slave, then the signals are copied from the master; otherwise, they are set to logic low."
