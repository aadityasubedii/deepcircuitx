Module name: afifo 

Module specification: The 'afifo' is an Asynchronous First In, First Out (FIFO) memory buffer module, based on Verilog RTL codes, with writing and reading operations designed to occur at different clock frequencies. Parameters for data width, FIFO depth, and clock delay can be set by the user using the DSIZE, FIFO_DEPTH, and TCQ parameters respectively. The module has a variety of input and output ports. Inputs include the write clock (wr_clk), reset (rst), write enable (wr_en), write data (wr_data) and the read enable (rd_en) and read clock (rd_clk) signals. The outputs include read data (rd_data), and full, empty, and almost full flags. The FIFO buffer is implemented as a memory array (mem), with several other internal signals handling read/write operations, storing temporary data, and converting binary and gray addressing. The code itself is structured into several blocks which handle processes such as read/write synchronization, data writing, data reading, address generation, and status management operations. The 'afifo' module is specifically designed to handle asynchronous data flow in systems with differing input and output data rates.
