Comment: 
This block of Verilog code defines a hardware behaviour that triggers on the positive edge of either the WB_CLK_I signal or the Reset signal. In synchronous digital design, this is an essential part of controlling the timing and sequence of operations. The triggering action of the block is performed when there's a transition from a low to high voltage (positive edge) on either the WB_CLK_I or Reset inputs. This behaviour ensures that the logic inside this block only gets processed on these conditions, adding an important timing and initialisation control element to the digital design.
