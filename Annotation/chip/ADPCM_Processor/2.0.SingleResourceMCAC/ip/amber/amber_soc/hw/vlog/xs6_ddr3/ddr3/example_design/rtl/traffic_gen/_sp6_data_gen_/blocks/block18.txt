Comment: 
The provided Verilog module block is responsible for assigning specific 32-bit values to the SHIFTB registers based on the input data mode (data_mode_i). In each clock cycle, the block checks the value of data_mode_i. If data_mode_i equals 3'b101, 32-bit values with alternate bits high starting from the second least significant bit are assigned to the shift blocks. If data_mode_i equals 3'b100, each shift block receives a 32-bit value where only a single bit is high, with each shift block having the high bit in a successive order starting from the least significant bit. For all the other values of data_mode_i, negative values with alternating bits low starting from the second least significant bit are assigned to the shift blocks.
