    "block_comment": "The block mainly facilitates assignments and conditions for memory interface generator (MIG) operations. It firstly assigns a set of operations linking command status (`mig_p0_cmd_empty` and `mig_p0_cmd_full`) with memory buffer statuses (`p0_cmd_empty` and `p0_cmd_full`). The next part of the block is conditional based on the status of `C_PORT_ENABLE[1]`. If enabled, several operations regarding an arbitration process (`mig_p1_arb_en`), clock signal (`mig_p1_cmd_clk`), enabling signal (`mig_p1_cmd_en`), as well row address (`mig_p1_cmd_ra`) and bank address (`mig_p1_cmd_ba`) are linked to corresponding modules' outputs. These assignments effectively configure MIG operations based on specific system states."
