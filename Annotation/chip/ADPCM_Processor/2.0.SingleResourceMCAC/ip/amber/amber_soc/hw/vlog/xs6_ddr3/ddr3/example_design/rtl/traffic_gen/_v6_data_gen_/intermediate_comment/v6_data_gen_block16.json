    "block_comment": "This block handles the generation of data based on the input address and data mode. It operates on rising edges of the clock signal and triggers when either the FIFO is ready or command \"startC\" is initiated. If the command \"startC\" is issued and the \"sel_w1gen_logic\" is true, it checks for specific address ranges, and depending on the \"data_mode_i\", it assigns the output \"w1data\" using either the \"Data_Gen\" or the \"Data_GenW0\" function. The address ranges are specific indices ranging from 0 to 33 and also include groups of two indices ranging from 35 to 63 which are processed the same way. In case of unprovided addresses, it assigns a zero value to \"w1data\"."
