    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code assigns a boolean value to the variable `m_wb_access_finished`, indicating whether a write-back access operation has finished. The value of `m_wb_access_finished` will be true (`1`) if either module 1 (`m1`) or module 2 (`m2`) has completed the write-back (`wb`) process without error (`_ack_o`) or with an error (`_err_o`). If neither of these conditions are met, `m_wb_access_finished` will be false (`0`). Thus, this logic operation serves as a status check for the completion of write-back operations."
