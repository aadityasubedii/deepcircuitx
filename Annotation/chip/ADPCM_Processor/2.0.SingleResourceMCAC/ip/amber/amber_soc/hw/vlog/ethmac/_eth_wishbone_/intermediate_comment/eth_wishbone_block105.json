    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the generation of temporary buffer descriptor addresses for transmit and receive operations. For transmitting, it takes the conjunction of the transmission status write indicator and the negation of the wrap transmit status bit, sign extending this across the upper 7 bits of the resulting temporary transmit buffer descriptor address (`TempTxBDAddress[7:1]`). This is then logically ANDed with the incremented transmit buffer descriptor address (`TxBDAddress + 1'b1`). For receiving, the block generates a temporary receive buffer descriptor address (`TempRxBDAddress[7:1]`) based on the state of the wrap receive status bit. If `WrapRxStatusBit` is asserted, the result is the receive buffer descriptor number with the upper 7 bits asserted (`r_TxBDNum[6:0]`), else the increment of the current receive buffer descriptor address is used."
