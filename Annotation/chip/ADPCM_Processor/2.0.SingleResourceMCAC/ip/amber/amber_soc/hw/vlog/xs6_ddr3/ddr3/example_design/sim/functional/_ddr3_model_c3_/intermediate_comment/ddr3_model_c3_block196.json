    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is implementing a DQS (Data Strobe Signal) receiver function for DDR memory interfaces. The function is triggered always at the positive edge (rising edge) of the 12th DQS event signal. The implementation is quite straightforward, with the receiver function being called for the 12th event of the 'dqs_even' signal array whenever there is a positive edge in the signal, which usually corresponds to a certain bit value of the data being transmitted or received."
