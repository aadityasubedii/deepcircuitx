    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is primarily responsible for controlling the operation of a self-refresh request for memory control blocks (MCB). The block functions by waiting for a positive edge on the user interface clock before examining certain conditions to either set or clear the request flag. If a reset is detected, the request is immediately cleared. However, if a phase-locked loop lock (PLL_LOCK_R2) is obtained and no self-refresh request (SELFREFRESH_REQ_R3) is found, the request is cleared again. Conversely, if the system enters a dynamic calibration start state (START_DYN_CAL) and a self-refresh request is present, the request flag will be set."
