    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block invokes a timing check for the 57th bit of the dq_in signal array. It uses an `always` block that is sensitive to any changes in the dq_in[56] value. Whenever a change is observed on this 56th index (57th bit in 0-based index), the `dq_timing_check` function is triggered passing the bit position as a parameter. Hence, it ensures the signal integrity and timing compliance of this specific bit on the `dq_in` signal array."
