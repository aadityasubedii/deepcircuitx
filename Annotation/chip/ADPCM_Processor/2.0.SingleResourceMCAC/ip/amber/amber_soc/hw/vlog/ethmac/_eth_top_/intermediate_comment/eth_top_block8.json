    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the reset and update of the `WillSendControlFrame_sync3` signal. The state of `WillSendControlFrame_sync3` is set to 0 whenever there is a positive edge of `wb_rst_i` signifying a reset. Otherwise, every time there is a positive edge of the `wb_clk_i`, the value of `WillSendControlFrame_sync3` is updated to the previous (`#Tp` delay) state of `WillSendControlFrame_sync2`, assuring that the update is synchronous with the system clock."
