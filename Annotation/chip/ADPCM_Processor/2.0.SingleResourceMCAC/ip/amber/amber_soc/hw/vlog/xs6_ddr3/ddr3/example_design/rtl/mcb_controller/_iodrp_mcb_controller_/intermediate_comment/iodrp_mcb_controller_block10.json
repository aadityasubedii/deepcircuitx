    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is a multiplexer design that selects and assigns the data output. Depending on the value of 'addr_data_sel_n' signal. If 'addr_data_sel_n' is true, the output 'data_out' is assigned the lower bits of 'memcell_addr_reg' with a '0' MSB. Conversely, if 'addr_data_sel_n' is false, the lower bits from 'data_reg' are assigned to 'data_out' with '0' as the MSB. The purpose of appending a bit '0' is offering sign extension in case of signed arithmetic.\n"
