    "block_comment": "This block manages the conditions to reset `ReceivedPauseFrmWAddr` in response to `MRxClk` or `RxReset` signals. In case of `RxReset` or `ReceiveEnd` being high, it resets `ReceivedPauseFrmWAddr` after a delay (`#Tp`). However, if `ByteCntEq16`, `TypeLengthOK`, `OpCodeOK`, and `AddressOK` are all verified, `ReceivedPauseFrmWAddr` is set high after the same delay."
