    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the read data count. It functions under the positive edge of the input clock. If the 'dcount_rst' is asserted, it sets the 'rd_data_counts' to zero, effectively resetting the count. Otherwise, if the 'mcb_rd_en_o' is asserted, it increments 'rd_data_counts' by the factor of the data width per 8 bits, indicating that data was read."
