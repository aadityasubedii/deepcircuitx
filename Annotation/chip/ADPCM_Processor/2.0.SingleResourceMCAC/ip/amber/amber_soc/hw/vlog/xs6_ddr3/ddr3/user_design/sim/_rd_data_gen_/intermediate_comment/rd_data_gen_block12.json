    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog declares a register named `user_bl_cnt_is_1`. This register is generally used to store binary values, usually indicating the state of something in the system. Its value can be manipulated in sequential logic, while the register maintains its value until another clock cycle. However, without further context of the surrounding code it is challenging to pinpoint the specific purpose or usage of this register in the overall module or system."
