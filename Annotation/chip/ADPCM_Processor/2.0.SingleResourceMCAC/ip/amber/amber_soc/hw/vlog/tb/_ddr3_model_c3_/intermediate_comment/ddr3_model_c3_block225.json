    "block_comment": "The function open_bank_file attempts to open a file corresponding to a bank. It takes an integer bank as an argument, and creates a filename string by appending the bank number to the directory path \"tmp_model_dir\". It then tries to open the file with write and read permissions. If the file couldn't be opened, it displays an error message and terminates the program; if it does open, a success message is displayed (if DEBUG is true), and the file descriptor is returned."
