    "block_comment": "This piece of code initiates a transmission operation. The 'StartShiftWillEnd' signal is activated under a couple of conditions - when the last byte is being processed ('LastByteIn'), or when the receiving data is valid ('RxValid'), the frame ends ('RxEndFrm'), all bits of the receiving byte count are high due to bitwise AND operation ('&RxByteCnt') and the receive operation is within a permissible time or window('RxEnableWindow')."
