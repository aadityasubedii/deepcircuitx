With byte enable, finer control over write operations is facilitated. The input `i_byte_enable[3:0]` allows control over each byte of the 32-bit data such that each byte can be individually enabled/disabled for write. The parameters `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDRESS_WIDTH` set the width of the data and address bus. The SRAM is facilitated by using a Block RAM primitive `RAMB8BWER` in the Xilinx design suite. This module takes care of writing data (`i_write_data`) to the specified address (`i_address`) when write is enabled (`i_write_enable`). It also reads out data (`o_read_data`) from the specified address. The module also includes an initial block which checks the consistency of user-defined input parameters against the module's requirements."

It takes the bitwise AND between the global write-enable signal (`i_write_enable`) for each bit, and the individual byte enable signals(`i_byte_enable[3:0]`). Hence, a byte is only written to if both the global write enable and the individual byte enable for that byte are high. This allows for byte-wise write enable to the memory block."
