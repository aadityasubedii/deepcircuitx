Comment: 
This block of Verilog code represents the instantiation of an output buffer with tri-state control (OBUFT) named "iob_we." It is used for controlling the 'write enable' signal of a memory controller block dram (mcbx_dram_we_n). The data input 'I' to this OBUFT is sourced from signal 'ioi_we', and the tri-state control input 'T' of this module is driven by the signal 't_we'. When 't_we' is high, the buffer drives 'mcbx_dram_we_n' as per 'ioi_we', and when 't_we' is low, it leaves 'mcbx_dram_we_n' in a high impedance state.
