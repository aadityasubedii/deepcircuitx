This block of code is a trigger event handler that latches the 'MRxErr' error condition for a data receiver at appropriate states. It is triggered on the positive edge of 'MRxClk' or 'Reset' signals. If 'Reset' is high, 'LatchedMRxErr' is reset to 0. Otherwise, if the receiver is either in the 'Preamble', 'SFD', any 'Data' state or the 'Idle' state (while not transmitting), and 'MRxErr' and 'MRxDV' are high, 'LatchedMRxErr' is set to 1, indicating an error. In all other cases, 'LatchedMRxErr' is reset to 0.
