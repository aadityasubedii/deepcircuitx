    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for asynchronous reset and synchronization of transmission pause signals. The block works with the leading edge of either mtx_clk_pad_i or wb_rst_i signals. When a reset (wb_rst_i) signal is received, it sets the TxPauseRq_sync1, TxPauseRq_sync2, and TxPauseRq_sync3 signals to their default low (0) states. If not in a reset state, it updates TxPauseRq_sync1, TxPauseRq_sync2, and TxPauseRq_sync3 sequentially based on the values of r_TxPauseRq & r_TxFlow, TxPauseRq_sync1, and TxPauseRq_sync2 respectively."
