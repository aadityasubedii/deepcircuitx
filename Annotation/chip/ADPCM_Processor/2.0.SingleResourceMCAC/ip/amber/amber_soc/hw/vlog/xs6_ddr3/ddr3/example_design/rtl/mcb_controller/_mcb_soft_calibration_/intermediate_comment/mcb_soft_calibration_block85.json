    "block_comment": "The block of code is a counter that is used for introducing a delay of approximately 200 microseconds (\u00b5s). When reset is called (RST), the `WAIT_200us_COUNTER` is either set to `16'h7FF0` if the system is in simulation mode (`C_SIMULATION == \"TRUE\"`) or reset to zero. After reset, the counter starts incrementing by 1 at each positive edge of `UI_CLK` until it reaches maximum (when the 16th bit is 1), where it stays stable until the next reset."
