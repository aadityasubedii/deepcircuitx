    "block_comment": "The given Verilog RTL block conditionally generates a specific data pattern if certain conditions are met. The block is activated when the data width is set to 32 and one of three data patterns - \"DGEN_WALKING0\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\" or \"DGEN_ALL\" is selected. This configuration enables a flexible testing framework that can simulate various data conditions based on different walking pattern algorithms.\n"
