    "block_comment": "This block represents a state machine that's responsible for switching between different states based on certain conditions. If the 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' signal is not set (i.e., it's false), the state is held at the 'WAIT8' state. Otherwise, it checks the 'First_In_Term_Done' signal. If this signal is set, then the next state is set as 'START_DYN_CAL', otherwise, it transitions to the 'WRITE_CALIBRATE' state. These transitions determine the process flow of dynamic calibration or writing calibration in the larger system design."
