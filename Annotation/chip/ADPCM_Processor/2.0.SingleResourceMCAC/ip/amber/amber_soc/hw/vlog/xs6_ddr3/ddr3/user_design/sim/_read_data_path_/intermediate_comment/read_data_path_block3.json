    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of the `cumlative_dq_lane_error_reg` to `cumlative_dq_lane_error_r`. This copying of values from the `cumlative_dq_lane_error_reg` register to `cumlative_dq_lane_error_r` is performed on every positive edge of the clock. This forms a part of the error tracking or correction mechanism in the overall design where the cumulative error of the data-queue lane is recorded."
