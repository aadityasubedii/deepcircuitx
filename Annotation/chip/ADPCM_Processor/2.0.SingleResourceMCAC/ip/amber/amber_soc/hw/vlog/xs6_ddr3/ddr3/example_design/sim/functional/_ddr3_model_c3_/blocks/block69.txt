This block of code invokes a timing check for the 62nd element of the 'dq_in' array. In Verilog coding, the 'always @' construct means the block of code following it is executed whenever there is a change in the signal mentioned after the '@'. In this case, every time there is a change in 'dq_in[61]', the 'dq_timing_check(61)' function is called to perform a timing check for this specific element of the array.
