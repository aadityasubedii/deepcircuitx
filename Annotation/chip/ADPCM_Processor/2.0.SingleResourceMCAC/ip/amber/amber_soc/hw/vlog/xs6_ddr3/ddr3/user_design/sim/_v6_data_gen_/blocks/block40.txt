Comment: 
This block is a data pattern generator for a 64-pin data quality (DQ) system using different data patterns. Given certain conditions on the number of DQ pins and the selected data pattern, the block executes the correlated data pattern. The chosen patterns could be NEIGHBOR, WALKING1, WALKING0, or ALL. The methodology employed in this block uses conditional (if) statement within the generate construct to check the number of pins and pattern. The selected pattern is always updated at the positive edge of clock input, ensuring synchronous operation.
