This block of code functions as a display module in a larger DDR3-based memory system. It's role is to print out the memory address and data whenever a write or read action takes place. On the rising edge of 'i_clk' (the system clock), if 'start_write' is high, the block displays the memory write action which includes the address ('i_i_wb_adr'), data blocks 'i_mwdata' and byte enables 'i_mwben'. Similarly, if the 'i_rd_empty' flag is low, indicating data is available to read, the block prints out the read action details which are the memory address and data blocks 'i_rd_data'. The decoding of the data and byte enables into 4 and 16 chunks respectively aids in precise data handling.
