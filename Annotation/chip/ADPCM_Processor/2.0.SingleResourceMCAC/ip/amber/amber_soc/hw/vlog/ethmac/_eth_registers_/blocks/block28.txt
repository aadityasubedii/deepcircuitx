This block of code assigns data from the 16-bit MIITX_DATAOut signal to the 16-bit r_CtrlData signal. This is a simple assignment operation in Verilog where the value of MIITX_DATAOut is transmitted to r_CtrlData, which can be used in subsequent portions of the design. This process is synchronous to the circuit clock.
