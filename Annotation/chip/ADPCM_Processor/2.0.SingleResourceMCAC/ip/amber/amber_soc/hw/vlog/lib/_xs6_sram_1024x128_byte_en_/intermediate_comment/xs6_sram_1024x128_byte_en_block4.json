    "block_comment": "This block of code is implementing a block RAM with inferred write-first memory functionality. The width of data input and output ports is defined as 36-bit for both memories A and B, but the read actions are only enabled for memory A. Clock signals are only linked to memory A, suggesting a single-port operation. The configuration does not enable any reset or register functionalities. For addressing, a 9-bit i_address input gets concatenated with fixed zeros to make up the 14-bit ADDRA input field. The operation of this memory functions under the control of the write enable signals 'wea_b1', and it uses the 'i_write_data' array for the data inputs and 'read_data_b1' array for the data outputs."
