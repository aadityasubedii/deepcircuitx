This block of code serves as an initial check for parameter values in a Verilog module. Specifically, it checks if DATA_WIDTH is set to 128 and ADDRESS_WIDTH is set to 8. If these conditions are not met, it displays warnings indicating incorrect parameter values. The block uses an initial condition and a switch-case statement to implement these checks. It aims to ensure conformity to expected parameter settings and is crucial for proper functioning of the entire module. This check is intended to be executed once when the simulation begins.
