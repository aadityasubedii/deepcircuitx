    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the interface for various types of DDR memory. It only activates the interface when the memory type is DDR, DDR2, or DDR3 and the parameter SKIP_IN_TERM_CAL is not set. It uses two modules, IOBUF and IODRP2, for data transference. IOBUF handles the basic I/O buffer tasks, while IODRP2 takes in more specific instructions and data. For example, IOBUF_ZIO manages the bidirectional data flow with the help of four wires, ZIO_IN, ZIO_Pin, ZIO_OUT, and ZIO_TOUT. IODRP2_ZIO further manages more detailed operations and synchronizes with UI clock."
