    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the enabling and instruction determination for memory command operations in a DDR3 memory module. At every positive edge of the input clock (`i_clk`), the code first generates the command byte address (`o_cmd_byte_addr`) by concatenating the `wb_adr_d1` address's range from 29 to 4 bits with a 4-bit zero vector. Following this, the memory operation command enable (`o_cmd_en`) is high only if the DDR3 memory is not busy and either a Write (`start_write_d1`) or a Read (`start_read_d1`) operation starts. The command instruction (`o_cmd_instr`) is determined via a ternary operation \u2013 if a Write operation has started, it regards it as 3'b0; otherwise, it's 3'b1, denoting a Read operation.\n"
