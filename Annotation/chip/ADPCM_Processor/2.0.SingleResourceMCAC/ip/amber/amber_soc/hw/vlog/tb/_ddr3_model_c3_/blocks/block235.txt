Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for implementing a delay in the signal propagation to the `odt_in` output. The `always` keyword in Verilog creates a procedural block that executes whenever there is a change in the `odt` input. This change then triggers the assignment of the `odt` value to `odt_in` after a predefined delay, denoted by `BUS_DELAY`. This delay is used for synchronizing signals in digital circuits, usually to match processing rates or to observe signals clearly in simulations.
