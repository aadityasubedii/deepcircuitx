    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a timing check in response to changes to the 12th bit of the \"dq_in\" register. It uses the \"always @\" construct in Verilog to execute the \"dq_timing_check\" function whenever the 12th bit of the \"dq_in\" register changes, allowing for reactiveness to real-time changes and efficient monitoring of timing violations."
