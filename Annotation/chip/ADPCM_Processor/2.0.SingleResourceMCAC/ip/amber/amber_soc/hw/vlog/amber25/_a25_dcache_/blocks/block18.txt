Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is employed to select a way out of three options. The function 'pick_way' is called with its parameters being 'valid_bits_r' and 'random_num', respectively. The selection is made based on the value of 'random_num', where the function will output the chosen direction to the variable 'next_way'. This forms a part of the routing algorithm enabling navigation through a three-way junction in the system.
