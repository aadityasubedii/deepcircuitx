Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a flip-flop that either resets when a specific condition is met or updates values on the rising edge of a clock signal. If the second bit of input `rst_i` or `manual_clear_error` is high, the block resets registers `dq_lane_error_r1`, `dq_lane_error_r2`, `data_valid_r`, and `cumlative_dq_lane_error_reg` to 0. If these conditions are not met, the block instead, updates `data_valid_r`, `dq_lane_error_r1` and `cumlative_dq_lane_error_reg` with new incoming values on every rising edge of `clk_i`. The `#TCQ` before the assignments represent a delay event control indicating a delay of TCQ simulation time units before execution of the assignments.
