    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a timing check operation on the 63rd bit of the input array `dq_in`. The operation is triggered whenever there is a change in value of the 63rd bit, as indicated by the `always @` trigger. This trigger executes the `dq_timing_check` function with '62' as the index argument, which could potentially be used to specify which bit of the `dq_in` array is being checked or processed."
