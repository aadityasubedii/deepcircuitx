It can be parameterized for different data widths, depths, and clock delays. The parameters in the afifo module including DSIZE, FIFO_DEPTH, and ASIZE allow you to set the width of the data, depth of the FIFO, and address size respectively. The FIFO buffer itself is implemented as an array (mem) of registers. The almost_full and full flags will trigger when the FIFO is almost full or full, respectively."

The write operation can only occur when wr_en signal is high and similarly, rd_en signal high allows the read operation to occur. The wr_data is the data that is being written into the buffer and rd_data gets the data that is being read from the FIFO. Full, empty and almost_full signals provide status of the FIFO. When the 'full' signal is high, it indicates that the FIFO is fully packed and cannot accept any more data. The 'empty' signal being high means there are no data left to read in the FIFO, and 'almost_full' high signifies that the FIFO buffer is almost full but not yet completely packed."
