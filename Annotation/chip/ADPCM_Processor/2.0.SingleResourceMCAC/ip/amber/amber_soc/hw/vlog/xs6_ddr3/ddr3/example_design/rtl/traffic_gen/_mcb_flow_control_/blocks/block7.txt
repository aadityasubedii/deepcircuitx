This Verilog block is a command register that stores command, address and burst length upon receiving a push command. On every rising edge of the clock signal (clk_i), if a push command (push_cmd) is received, the block will store the incoming command (cmd_i), address (addr_i), and burst length (bl_i - 1, subtracting 1 to account for zero-indexing) into corresponding registers, with #TCQ as the delay, representing a specific time to ensure the command is correctly handled.
