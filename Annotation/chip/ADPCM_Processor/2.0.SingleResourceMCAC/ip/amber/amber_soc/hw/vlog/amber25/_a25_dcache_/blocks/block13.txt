Comment: 
This function selects an 'unoccupied' way from an input set of valid bits. It employs a sequential evaluation mechanism where each valid bit, from 0 to 7, is individually verified. If a bit is not occupied (equals '0'), the function outputs a corresponding value, where each valid bit location corresponds to a unique binary representation of '1' in a position from LSB to MSB. In absence of an unoccupied bit or if all bits are occupied (each equals '1'), the function determines the output based on an input random number, mapping it to a pre-determined binary value.
