This block manages the latching of received data in a communication protocol. Upon detection of rising edge of MRxClk or Reset signals, the block performs a set of operations. It cleanly resets the latched received data to zero during the system reset. Furthermore, this block ensures that data is captured and latched correctly from a FIFO and accommodates different data sizes. This latching operation involves shifting the currently seen data and appending the newly received data utilizing the valid byte count to update the latch in case of complete shift cycle. Thus, it ensures seamless data latching for varying byte size, catering to different system scenarios.
