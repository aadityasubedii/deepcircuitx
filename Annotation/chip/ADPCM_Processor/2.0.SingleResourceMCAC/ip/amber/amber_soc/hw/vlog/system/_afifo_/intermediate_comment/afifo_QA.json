This module receives data through the \"i_data\" input signal when \"i_push\" is active and not full. The data is stored in the FIFO memory and is outputted through \"o_data\" when \"i_pop\" is active and it is not empty. \"o_full\" and \"o_empty\" are flags that indicate the full and empty status of the FIFO buffer, which guide when data can be written and read. The pointers for writing and reading operations are implemented using Gray code to prevent synchronization issues when crossing clock domains. A pair of functions (\"gray8\" and \"ungray8\") is used to convert normal binary numbers to Gray code and vice versa."
