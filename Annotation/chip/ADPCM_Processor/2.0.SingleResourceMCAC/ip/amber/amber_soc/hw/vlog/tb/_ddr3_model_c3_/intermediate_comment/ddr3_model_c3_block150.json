    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for triggering a timing check whenever the 15th bit of the address signal (addr_in[14]) changes. It achieves this through the use of an 'always' statement that monitors the specific bit for any alterations. Upon detection of a change, the code invokes a function called 'cmd_addr_timing_check', passing '21' as an argument, which may correspond to a specific timing protocol or checking interval."
