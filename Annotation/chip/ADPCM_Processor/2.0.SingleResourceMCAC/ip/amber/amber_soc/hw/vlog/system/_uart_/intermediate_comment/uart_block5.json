    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily handles warning messages for UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) FIFO (First In First Out) buffer overflow and underflow conditions. It utilizes a clock-sensitive logic block that checks for specific FIFO conditions at every positive edge of the input clock 'i_clk'. It raises a warning message when there is an attempt to pop an item from the RX FIFO when it is empty (underflow), and when there is an attempt to push an item into the RX FIFO when it is full (overflow). Similarly, it raises a warning message when there is an attempt to push data into the TX FIFO when it is full (overflow), providing the first byte of the data in the warning message."
