    "block_comment": "This block enables the data valid flag. If a rising clock edge is detected, the block checks the second bit of the reset input, and if it's active, the data valid flag is reset to 0. However, if a start command is detected, the data valid flag is set to 1. If neither condition is met, the flag is set to 0 when the FIFO is not full and the user burst count is less or equal to 1. This provides control over the validation of data based on different conditions and input signals."
