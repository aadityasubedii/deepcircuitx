The block of code handles conditions related to a write operation in a system. Upon receiving a high signal on either the clock 'Clk' or the reset line 'Reset', the code checks the status of the 'Reset' line. If 'Reset' is high, it signifies that the operation needs to be halted; hence, 'InProgress' and 'WriteOp' are set to 0 after Tp delay, indicating that no operation is underway. If 'Reset' is low, and memory controller enable 'MdcEn' is high, it implies a new operation is starting. It further checks 'StartOp'; if high, and if no ongoing operation 'InProgress' is false, 'WriteOp' is set to WriteDataOp and 'InProgress' signifies an operation in progress. If 'StartOp' is low and 'EndOp' high, it signifies the end of an operation, hence 'InProgress' and 'WriteOp' are set to 0 post Tp delay.
