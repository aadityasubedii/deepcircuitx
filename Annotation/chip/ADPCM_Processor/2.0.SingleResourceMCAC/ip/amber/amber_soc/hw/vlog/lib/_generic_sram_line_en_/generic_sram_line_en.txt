Module-level comment: The 'generic_sram_line_en' module implements a generic synchronous SRAM with line enables. It supports writing data ('i_write_data') to a specified address ('i_address') upon assertion of 'i_write_enable' signal, and reading data at the positive clock edge ('i_clk'). The implementation leverages an internal memory table 'mem' with size and data width defined by parameters ADDRESS_WIDTH and DATA_WIDTH respectively. Option to initialize 'mem' with zeros through parameter INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO is also available. The reading/writing operations are controlled by a single synchronous block gated by 'i_clk'.
