    "block_comment": "This block of code invokes the function 'dq_timing_check' whenever there is a change in the signal 'dq_in[36]'. It uses 'always @' construct to monitor changes in the specific bit of 'dq_in' array, bit 36, and on any change, it calls the 'dq_timing_check' function with '36' as an argument."
