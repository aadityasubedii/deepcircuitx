Comment: 
This block manages the initialization steps of dynamic calibration and pre-system reset operations. It primarily sets control signals for the Memory Controller Block (MCB). The 'LastPass_DynCal' signal is set as 'IN_TERM_PASS', the 'MCB_UICMDEN' signal is off indicating no command should be enabled, and both 'MCB_UIDONECAL' and 'Pre_SYSRST' are set indicating that calibration is done and system reset is requested. For the state machine transitions, if the current mode is not 'CALIBRATION', the state transitions to 'START_DYN_CAL'. Alternatively, if pre-system reset minimum pulse width condition is met, it transitions to 'WAIT_FOR_UODONE'.
