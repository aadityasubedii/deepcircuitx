Comment: 
This block of code represents a synchronous reset design pattern in a Verilog module. It syncs an input signal (`i_ddr_calib_done`) to an internal signal (`ddr_calib_done_sync_r`) and also provides the functionality to reset the sync register to a zero state. The block is triggered on every positive edge of the system clock (`o_sys_clk`) or the temporary reset (`rst_tmp`). The presence of a reset signal (`rst_tmp`) sets all respective bits of `ddr_calib_done_sync_r` to '0'. In absence of a reset signal, the least significant bit of `ddr_calib_done_sync_r` is assigned the value of `i_ddr_calib_done` and other bits get the value of successive bits in `ddr_calib_done_sync_r`. The size of `ddr_calib_done_sync_r` is determined by `RST_SYNC_NUM`.
