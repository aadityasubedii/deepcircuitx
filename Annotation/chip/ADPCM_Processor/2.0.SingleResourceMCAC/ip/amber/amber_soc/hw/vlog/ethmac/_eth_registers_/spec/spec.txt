Module name: eth_registers. Module specification: The eth_registers module implements the register interface for an Ethernet controller. It handles reading and writing of various control and status registers, such as MODER (Mode Register), INT_SOURCE (Interrupt Source), IPGT (Inter-Packet Gap Time), MAC addresses, and others. The module has numerous input ports, including DataIn (32-bit input data), Address (8-bit register address), Rw (Read/Write control), Cs (Chip select), Clk (system clock), Reset, and various control signals. Output ports include DataOut (32-bit output data), numerous configuration signals (e.g., r_RecSmall, r_Pad, r_HugEn), and interrupt output (int_o). Internal signals are used for register selection, data storage, and interrupt handling. The module is divided into several sections: register definition and selection,
