Comment: 
This Verilog block dynamically enables a bidirectional buffer based on the preset configuration parameter. If the configuration parameter C_NUM_DQ_PINS equals 16, an instance of OBUFT bidirectional buffer named iob_udm is created. The buffer's input, tristate control and output are connected to ioi_udm, t_udm, and mcbx_dram_udm signals respectively, providing control over data transfer direction.
