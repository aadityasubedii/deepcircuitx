    "block_comment": "This block of code is for managing cache read operations in a parameterized multiway associative cache system. It assigns the read data value depending on which cache way got a hit. This selection process is controlled by the `WAYS` parameter which determines the number of ways present in the system. Utilizing Verilog conditional (ternary) operator, it assigns `hit_rdata` the corresponding `data_rdata_way` if a hit occurs in a particular way (`data_hit_way`). If no hit occurs in any way, `hit_rdata` is set to a default value."
