Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL describes a delay-locked loop for data sampling that is triggered on every positive edge of the "dqs_in[9]" signal. The detection of the positive edge of the array element "dqs_in[9]" triggers the "dqs_pos_timing_check(9)" method, which takes in the signal line index (9 in this case) and may be responsible for setting up appropriate parameters related to sampling timing of this specific dqs-line.
