Comment: 
This block of code launches a function `dq_timing_check` whenever there is a change in the 47th bit of the `dq_in` array. The function `dq_timing_check` checks the timing of the data that is being interpretted by the bit number in the `dq_in` array provided as its parameter. The block uses an always block for event-controlled actions which makes it sensitive to any changes in `dq_in[46]`, causing it to consistently monitor this specific bit.
