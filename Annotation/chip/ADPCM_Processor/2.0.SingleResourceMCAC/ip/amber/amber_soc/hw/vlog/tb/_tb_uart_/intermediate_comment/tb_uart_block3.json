    "block_comment": "The block is a serial transmission bit counter in a UART communication system. On the falling edge of the uart reset signal, or at every rising edge of the UART clock signal, it resets the transmit bit count to zero. However, as long as the reset signal is not active and the transmit bit count is not equal to nine, the count iterates by incrementing one on every clock cycle, rolling over to zero after reaching nine."
