    "block_comment": "This block of code is performing a dynamic change monitoring and subsequent timing check on a particular data signal. Specifically, the block reacts to any change in the 4th bit (index 3, zero-based) of data signal 'dm_in'. Upon change detection, it invokes the procedure 'dm_timing_check' with 3 as the input argument. This is achieved through usage of 'always @' which is a sensitivity list implying that the logic should recompute whenever the specified variable changes. This is a common practice in design of asynchronous systems."
