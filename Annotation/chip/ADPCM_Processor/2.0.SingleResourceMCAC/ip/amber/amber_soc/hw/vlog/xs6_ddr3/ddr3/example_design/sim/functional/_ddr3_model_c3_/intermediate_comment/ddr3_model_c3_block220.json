    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to write data to a specified memory location in a memory system, with consideration for overflow errors. The function is implemented by first creating an address from the provided bank, row, and column identifiers. The address is divided by `BL_MAX` to normalize it for memory use. In the case of memory overflow, an error message is displayed indicating the exact time and location of the overflow. The address and data are then written to the memory if there's an available space, else an overflow error would be thrown, and the system stopped if the `STOP_ON_ERROR` flag is set."
