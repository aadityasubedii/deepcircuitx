Module name: cmd_gen. Module specification: The cmd_gen module generates memory commands for a memory controller, producing address, instruction, and burst length signals based on various input parameters and modes. It supports different address generation modes (BRAM, fixed, PRBS, sequential), instruction modes, and burst length modes. The module has inputs for clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), traffic control (run_traffic_i), read buffer availability (rd_buff_avail_i), address range (start_addr_i, end_addr_i), seeds for PRBS generation (cmd_seed_i, data_seed_i), mode selection (addr_mode_i, data_mode_i, instr_mode_i, bl_mode_i), and fixed values (fixed_bl_i, fixed_instr_i, fixed_addr_i). Outputs include generated address (addr_
