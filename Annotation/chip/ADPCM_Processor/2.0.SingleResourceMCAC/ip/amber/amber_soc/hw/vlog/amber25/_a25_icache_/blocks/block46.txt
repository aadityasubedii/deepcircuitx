Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is a simple register implementation. On every rising edge of the clock signal (`i_clk`), the content of the control/address line (`address_c`) is stored in the register (`address_r`). This is achieved by the simple assignment in a posedge i_clk always block, which is equivalent to edge-triggered behavior in digital logic.
