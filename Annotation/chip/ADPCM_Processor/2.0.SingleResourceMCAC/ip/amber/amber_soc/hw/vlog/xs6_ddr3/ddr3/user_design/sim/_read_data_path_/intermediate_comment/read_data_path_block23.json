    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a value to the rd_mdata variable based on specific conditions that relate to different FPGA families and the memory burst length. The value is dependent on the FPGA family and the memory burst length. If the FPGA family is SPARTAN6, the rd_data_r3 value is assigned to rd_mdata. If the FPGA family is VIRTEX6 and the memory burst length is 4, then rd_v6_mdata_r2 is assigned to rd_mdata. In all other cases, rd_data_r is the default value assigned to rd_mdata."
