Comment: 
This block of code generates an internal system reset signal. It uses an OR bitwise operation on sys_rst and the inverted value of gated_pll_lock to assign a value to int_sys_rst. The output int_sys_rst will be high if the system reset sys_rst is high or if the PLL is not locked, indicated by a low or '0' state of gated_pll_lock.
