Comment: 
The block operates a set of control signals that work on the conditional evaluation of a primary signal i_core_stall. The signals update based on the negation of the i_core_stall signal. Signals daddress_update, exec_load_rd_update, privileged_update, exclusive_update, write_enable_update, write_data_update, and byte_enable_update are asserted when processing is not stalled. Additionally, exec_load_rd_update, exclusive_update, write_data_update, and byte_enable_update require executing and other conditions like i_write_data_wen. iaddress_update, however, changes either when pc_dmem_wen is asserted or when there's no stall and no conflict.
