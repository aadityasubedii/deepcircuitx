    "block_comment": "This block monitors for error conditions in Wishbone transactions. It specifically checks s1_wb_err_i and s2_wb_err_i signals upon a positive edge of wb_clk_i. If an error signal is true and a cycle is ongoing (indicated by s1_wb_cyc_o and s2_wb_cyc_o respectively), it displays an error message along with the current time, important transaction parameters (like operation address, data, selector, and write enable status), then halts the operation."
