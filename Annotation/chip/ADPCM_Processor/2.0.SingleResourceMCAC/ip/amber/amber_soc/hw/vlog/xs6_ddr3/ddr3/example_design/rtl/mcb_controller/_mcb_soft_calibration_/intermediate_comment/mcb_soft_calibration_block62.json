    "block_comment": "The block of code serves as a six-bit counter in Verilog. Triggered on the positive edge of `UI_CLK`, it can be reset or incremented based on control signals. If the `RST_reg` control signal is true, the counter `count` is reset to `6'd0`. If not, and the `counter_en` control signal is active, the `count` is then incremented by `1'b1`. If neither is true, the `count` is reset to `6'd0`."
