    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to manage the registration of data and addresses into memory on rising edges of `DRP_CLK`. When the state machine is in the `READY` state, it assigns the incoming `memcell_address` to the `memcell_addr_reg` register, `write_data` to the `data_reg` register, and the signal `rd_not_write` to the `rd_not_write_reg` register. This implementation is a typical register setup in a memory-based design. This block of code assures that data and address registers hold the most recent values when the state machine enters the `READY` state, and the `rd_not_write` signal determines whether to read or write that data."
