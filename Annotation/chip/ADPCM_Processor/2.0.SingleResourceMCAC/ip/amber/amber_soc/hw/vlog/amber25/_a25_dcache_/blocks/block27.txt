Comment: 
The block of code handles state transitions in an idle state and updates valid_bits_r at the positive edge of the clock. If the current state is idle (CS_IDLE), it concatenates the most significant bit of `tag_rdata_way[1]` and `tag_rdata_way[0]` (assuming a tag width larger than one), and assigns this value to `valid_bits_r`.
