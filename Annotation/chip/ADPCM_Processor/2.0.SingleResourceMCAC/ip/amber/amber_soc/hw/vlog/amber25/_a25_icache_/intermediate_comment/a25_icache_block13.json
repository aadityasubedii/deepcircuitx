    "block_comment": "This block is a Verilog function implementation to determine the way based on given valid bits and a random number. The function iterates through the valid bits, which are used as flags. It progresses from bit 0 to bit 7, and for the first bit found to be '0', it assigns a respective binary value to the 'pick_way'. If all bits are set (1), it uses the random number to pick the way. The cases for random numbers are handled in the sequence from 3'b000 to 3'b110, with each case returning a specific binary value for 'pick_way'. The default case returns the binary representation for the second way."
