    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for indicating a `read_miss` condition in a caching system. The `read_miss` is signaled when three conditions are met simultaneously: the system is enabled (i.e., `enable` is true), the system is not set for writing (`i_write_enable` is false), and neither a cache hit (`hit` is false) nor a write-back buffer read hit (`wb_read_buf_hit` is false) occurs. The block employs a simple distributed logical operation design to evaluate these conditions."
