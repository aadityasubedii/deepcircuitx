    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the push operation for a receive (Rx) FIFO queue in a serial communication interface. The push operation is activated when the receiving line (rxd_state) is at the STOP state and no more bits are expected to be received (rx_bit_pulse_count is zero). This implies that an entire data word has been received, necessitating the move to the FIFO. The code uses the 'assign' keyword to continuously monitor the conditions and update the 'rx_fifo_push' signal accordingly."
