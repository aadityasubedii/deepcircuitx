    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the update of the available buffer count in a data link system. Running synchronously with the positive edge clock (clk_i), the module calculates the available buffer count by subtracting the difference of requested and received read data counts from the total buffer count (64), and assigns the result to the register buf_avail_r after a time delay defined by TCQ."
