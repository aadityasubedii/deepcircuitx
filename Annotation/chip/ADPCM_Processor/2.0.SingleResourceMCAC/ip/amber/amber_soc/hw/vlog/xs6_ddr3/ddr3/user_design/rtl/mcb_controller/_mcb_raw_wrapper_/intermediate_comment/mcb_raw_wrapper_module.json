    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper for interfacing with various DDR memory types. It manages the physical interface between FPGA and memory, handling data read/write operations, address management, and command issuing. The wrapper supports multiple port configurations, different memory widths, and memory-specific signals. It utilizes IODRP2_MCB blocks for I/O delay calibration, OSERDES2 blocks for data serialization, and various IOBUF/OBUFT components for signal interfacing. The module also includes logic for self-refresh operations, calibration, and dynamic reconfiguration."
