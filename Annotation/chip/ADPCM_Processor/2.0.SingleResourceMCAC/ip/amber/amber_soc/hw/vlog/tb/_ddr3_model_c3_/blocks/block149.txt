Comment: 
This block is an event-driven procedural block that triggers on changes to the most significant bit (bit 15) of the address input (`addr_in`). The implementation uses an `always` block, standard in Verilog RTL to describe behaviour sensitive to signal changes. Upon the change of state on `addr_in[15]`, it calls the function `cmd_addr_timing_check` with a parameter of 22. The function call infers that it possibly carries out a timing analysis for command and address signals in the system, considering '22' may refer to a specific timing constraint or specification- these details would be understood based on the deeper context of the code.
