    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for creating a synchronization point named 'calib_done_synch'. The code uses the module 'mcb_ui_top_synch' to perform synchronization, where 'C_SYNCH_WIDTH' parameter has been set to 1, indicating it is a single-bit synchronization. The input to this synchronization process comes from wire 'uo_done_cal' while the output of the synchronization gets wired to 'calib_done_synch' under the clock cycle 's4_axi_aclk'."
