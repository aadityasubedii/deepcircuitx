    "block_comment": "This block of code introduces a conditional construct in Verilog RTL design. If the parameter or define SYNC equals to 1, the block labeled 'RDSYNC' is executed. The 'generate' keyword in Verilog is used to create \n\ninstances of modules conditionally or unconditionally in a loop. This block of code appears to be a part of a larger design because it creates instances based on the parameter value. Still, the detailed functionality of 'RDSYNC' is not provided in this block."
