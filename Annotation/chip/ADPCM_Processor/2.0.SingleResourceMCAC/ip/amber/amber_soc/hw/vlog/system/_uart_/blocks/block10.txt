This block acts as a write buffer acknowledgment signal generator. The signal, wb_read_ack, is activated (assigned as true) when three conditions are met: i_wb_stb is asserted, i_wb_we is not asserted (hence it's an operation of read, not write), and o_wb_ack is asserted. This assignment will suffice when all of these mentioned conditions are true simultaneously.
