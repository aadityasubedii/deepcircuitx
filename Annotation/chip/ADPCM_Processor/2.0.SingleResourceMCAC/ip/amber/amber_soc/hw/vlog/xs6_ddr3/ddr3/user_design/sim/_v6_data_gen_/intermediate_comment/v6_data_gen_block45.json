    "block_comment": "This block of code dynamically generates a specific data pattern if certain conditions are met at runtime. The \"generate-if\" construct, endemic to Verilog language, is used to dictate that if the number of DQ pins is 48 and if the data pattern is either \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\" or \"DGEN_ALL\", a specific pattern (identified by the \"WALKING_ONE_48_PATTERN\" tag) is produced. This operation only occurs on the positive edge of the input clock signal, ensuring precise timing context for synchronous logic."
