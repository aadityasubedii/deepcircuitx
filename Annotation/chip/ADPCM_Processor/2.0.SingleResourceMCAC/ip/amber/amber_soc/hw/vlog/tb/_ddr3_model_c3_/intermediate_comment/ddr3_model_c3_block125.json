    "block_comment": "This block of code listens for changes to the 6th bit of the `dq_in` signal array and triggers the `dq_timing_check` function with the value of 5. This is implemented with the `always` keyword, which creates a procedural block that gets triggered whenever there is a change in the listed signals/deps in the `@()` part. In this case, the code block invokes the `dq_timing_check` function passing the hardcoded integral value 5 as an argument, whenever `dq_in[5]` changes its state.\n"
