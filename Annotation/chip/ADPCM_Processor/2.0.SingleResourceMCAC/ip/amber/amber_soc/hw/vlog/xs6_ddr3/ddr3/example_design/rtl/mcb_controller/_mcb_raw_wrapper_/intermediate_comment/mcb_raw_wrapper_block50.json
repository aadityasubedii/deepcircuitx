    "block_comment": "This Verilog logic block primarily handles the selection and mapping of read/write accesses, error checking, and signalling for a memory interface. It first checks the user interface mode, if it's AXI, the read-enable signal 'mig_p1_rd_en' simply follows 'p0_rd_en'. Otherwise, it becomes active only when 'p0_rd_en' signals and not empty. P0's various statuses such as write/read counts, availability, and errors are assigned from the MIG P1 values with the additional possibility of having errors from MIG P0. Alternatively, when the condition is not met, the block enters a reset state where all relevant signals are turned off, i.e., assigned to 'b0. This ensures orderly control and error management for memory operations."
