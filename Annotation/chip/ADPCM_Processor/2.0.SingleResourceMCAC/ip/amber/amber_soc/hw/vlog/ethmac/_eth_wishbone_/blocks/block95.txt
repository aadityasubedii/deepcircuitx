Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the packet transmission aborting sequence. In the case of a reset event, or when certain conditions are met regarding the data transmission status, the TxAbortPacket signal is set to 1, which signifies aborting the current packet transmission. Namely, these conditions include the non-engagement of the transmission burst mode, or the master write back transmission signaling that access is finished, or there isn't a blockage on the abort packet command. If these conditions are not met, the TxAbortPacket is reset to 0, thus continuing the transmission. The signal assignments are time-proportional according to the predefined parameter `Tp`.
