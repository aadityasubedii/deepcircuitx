This block of code implements a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generator depending on the command pattern provided. Specific functionality is enabled when the CMD_PATTERN is either 'CGEN_PRBS' or 'CGEN_ALL'. The PRBS generator is parametrically instantiated with certain operational parameters like the timing, family, command, address width, seed width, and PRBS width. The generator is clocked by 'clk_i' and 'cmd_clk_en'. The initialization of the PRBS seed is controlled by 'load_seed_i'. The current PRBS seed value is inputted through 'cmd_seed_i[16:2]'. The generated PRBS is output through 'prbs_bl'.
