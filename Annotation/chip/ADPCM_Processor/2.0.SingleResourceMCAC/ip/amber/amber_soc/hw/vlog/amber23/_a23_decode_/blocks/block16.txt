Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles two control states: MULT_STORE and MULT_ACCUMU. During the MULT_STORE state, it sets the register write selection and multiply function, and configures the register bank write selection based on itype (MULT condition). It also sets the status bits selection and write enable flag, given a particular condition on the instruction set (20th bit is true). In the MULT_ACCUMU state, it sets the multiply function, disables write enable flag for the program counter and sets address selection.
