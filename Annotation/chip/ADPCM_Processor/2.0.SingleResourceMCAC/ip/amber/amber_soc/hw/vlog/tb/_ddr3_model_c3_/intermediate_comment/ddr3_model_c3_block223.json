    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily functions to write data into a file. It uses an input file descriptor along with the input index and data to define the specific portion of the file to be modified. This is implemented through the use of an fseek system function to seek to the desired offset in the file, as computed by multiplying the index by the size of the 'chunk'. Furthermore, the data to be written is manipulated such that if certain conditions are met, specific parts of the data are converted to a different binary state. Following this, the fwrite system function is used to write the data to the file at the computed offset."
