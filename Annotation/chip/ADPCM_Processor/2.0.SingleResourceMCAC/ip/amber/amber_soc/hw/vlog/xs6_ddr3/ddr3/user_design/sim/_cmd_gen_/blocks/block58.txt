Comment: 
This block of Verilog code creates a synchronous digital logic circuit triggered by the rising edge of an input clock signal (clk_i). The primary function is to generate a short pulse (run_traffic_pulse) whenever there's a rising edge of run_traffic_i. This is achieved by employing a register (run_traffic_r) that's updated at every rising edge of clk_i with the current state of run_traffic_i, and a conditional logic block where run_traffic_pulse is set high if there's a transition from low to high in run_traffic_i, else it's set low. The propagation delay for assignments is determined by #TCQ.
