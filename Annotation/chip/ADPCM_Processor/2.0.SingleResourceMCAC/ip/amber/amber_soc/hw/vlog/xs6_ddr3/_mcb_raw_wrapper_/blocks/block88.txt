This block of Verilog RTL code defines local parameters for memory configurations. These parameters consist of additional latency for DDR3 and DDR2 memory systems and the temperature compensated self-refresh (TC_SR) for mobile memory systems. The parameters are set as constants, where the DDR3 additional latency is turned off, and the DDR2 additional latency and mobile TC_SR are set to 0, meaning they are not being used in this context. These parameters are crucial to customize the memory controller for different types of memory systems.
