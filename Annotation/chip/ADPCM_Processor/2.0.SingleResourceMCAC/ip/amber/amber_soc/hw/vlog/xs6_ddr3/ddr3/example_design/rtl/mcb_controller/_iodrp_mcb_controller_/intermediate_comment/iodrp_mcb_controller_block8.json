    "block_comment": "The block manages a bit counter for specific states in a Digital Reconfigurable Port (DRP) operation. Upon a positive edge trigger of DRP_CLK, if the current 'state' is either in the ADDRESS phase or DATA phase and if not under reset(sync_rst), it increments the 'bit_cnt'. Otherwise, it resets 'bit_cnt' to zero."
