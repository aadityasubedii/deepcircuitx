    "block_comment": "This Verilog block controls an internal flag, `dfifo_has_enough_room`, that indicates if the Data FIFO buffer has enough room. The flag becomes high (`1`) when the buffer available (`buf_avail_r`) meets or exceeds the threshold of '62'. The block achieves this functionality by using a flip-flop that is positive-edge-triggered (occurs at the rising edge of the clock signal). Hence, the flag's condition is checked and updated at every positive clock edge. The block also introduces a one clock cycle delay version of `dfifo_has_enough_room` using variable `dfifo_has_enough_room_d1`."
