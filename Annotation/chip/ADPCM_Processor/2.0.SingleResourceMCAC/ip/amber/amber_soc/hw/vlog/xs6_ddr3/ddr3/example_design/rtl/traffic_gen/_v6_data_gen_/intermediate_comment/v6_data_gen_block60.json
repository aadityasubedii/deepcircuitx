    "block_comment": "This block is designed to manage data generation and arrangement depending on certain conditions. It generates data based on the signals fifo_rdy_i, cmd_startC, data_mode_i, addr_i, and sel_w1gen_logic, and the constant MEM_BURST_LEN. If conditions are met, the block will generate data using either the Data_Gen or Data_Gen_W0 function, depending on the data_mode_i signal. The block also checks addr_i[3], using the result to decide the correct method for generating data and assigns to w1data field with some delay denoted by #TCQ. For the case when the MEM_BURST_LEN is 8, it arranges data generated to different sections of w1data. It processes in blocks of NUM_DQ_PINS, manipulating subsets of the w1data variable depending on the constant MEM_BURST_LEN."
