    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the operation of the 'force_wrcmd_gen' signal depending on certain conditions. It's a synchronous block triggered at the positive edge of the 'clk_i' signal. If 'rst_i[0]' is high, then the 'force_wrcmd_gen' is forcefully held at logic 0 after a delay of 'TCQ' time units. Additionally, if 'buf_avail_r' equals 63, 'force_wrcmd_gen' is also held at logic 0 after 'TCQ' delay. If these conditions are not met and if 'instr_vld_dly1' is valid and a certain condition about 'pipe_data_in' is satisfied, then 'force_wrcmd_gen' is held at 1 after 'TCQ' delay."
