    "block_comment": "This block checks if the memory type is DDR2 (Double Data Rate 2). It uses a Verilog generate construct to conditionally instantiate parts of the design. If the condition is true, a new block labelled \"gen_cketrain_a\" is generated. This construct dynamically decides what hardware should exist at synthesis time. Thus, if the memory type defined is \"DDR2\", the block allows for certain DDR2-specific operations."
