    "block_comment": "This block essentially manages the address update in a data processing module. On each clock's positive edge, it selectively updates 'adata', the address, based on certain conditions. If the 'cmd_startD' condition is true, 'adata' is directly assigned the input address 'addr_i'. However, if a set of conditions - 'fifo_rdy_i' being ready, 'data_rdy_i' also being ready and 'user_burst_cnt' being more than 1, are true, 'adata' is updated by adding increments of 16, 8 or 4 to the existing 'adata' depending on whether the data width(DWIDTH) is 128, 64 or none of these. These increments tailor address updating to differing data widths."
