    "block_comment": "The function `get_1bit_signal` is used to select and output one of four 1-bit signals based on the 3-bit input `num`. The function performs this by leveraging a case statement. If `num` is `3'd0`, the function outputs `U_FETCH.i_write_enable`. If `num` is `3'd1`, it outputs `U_AMBER.fetch_stall`. If `num` is `3'd2`, it outputs `1'd0`. Lastly, if `num` is `3'd3`, it outputs `U_FETCH.i_data_access`. This function essentially acts as a 1-bit signal multiplexer using `num` to select the output.\n"
