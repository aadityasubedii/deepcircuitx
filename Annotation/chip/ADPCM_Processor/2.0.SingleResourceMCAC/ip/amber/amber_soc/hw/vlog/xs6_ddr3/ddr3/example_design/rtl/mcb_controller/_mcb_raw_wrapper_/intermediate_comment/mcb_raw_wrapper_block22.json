    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a 2-bit output serializer (OSERDES2). The serializer converts parallel data to serial data for transmission, specifically set in Master mode with a single-ended output. The desired data rates for output (OQ & OT) are set by constants C_OSERDES2_DATA_RATE_OQ and C_OSERDES2_DATA_RATE_OT. The clock signal (CLK0) is supplied by ioclk0 and the output enable (OCE) is controlled by the PLL lock (pll_lock). Constant inputs of '0' or '1' determine the serialized output."
