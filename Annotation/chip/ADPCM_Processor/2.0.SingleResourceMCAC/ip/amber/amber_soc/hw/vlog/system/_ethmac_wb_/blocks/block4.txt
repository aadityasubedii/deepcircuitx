This block performs conditional assignment to the variables o_m_wb_rdat, o_m_wb_sel, and o_m_wb_wdat depending on the value of WB_DWIDTH and the 2 least significant bits of i_m_wb_adr. If WB_DWIDTH equals 128, it applies specific endian transformations to different 32-bit segments of the input data i_m_wb_rdat, i_m_wb_sel and i_m_wb_wdat according to the indexed bits i_m_wb_adr[3:2]. If WB_DWIDTH is not 128, it applies the endian transformations to the entire 32-bit i_m_wb_rdat, i_m_wb_sel, and i_m_wb_wdat directly. This allows it to handle different data widths and endianness configurations.
