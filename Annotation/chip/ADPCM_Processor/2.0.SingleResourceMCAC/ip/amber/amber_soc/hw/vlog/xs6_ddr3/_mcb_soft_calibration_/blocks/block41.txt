This block of code dictates the control flow for a specific state called 'WAIT3' in a finite state machine (FSM). This piece of conditional logic checks if the 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' flag is not active. If it is not active, the machine remains in the 'WAIT3' state. However, if the 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' condition is fulfilled, i.e. it becomes active, the system transitions to the 'LOAD_ZIO_NTERM' state.
