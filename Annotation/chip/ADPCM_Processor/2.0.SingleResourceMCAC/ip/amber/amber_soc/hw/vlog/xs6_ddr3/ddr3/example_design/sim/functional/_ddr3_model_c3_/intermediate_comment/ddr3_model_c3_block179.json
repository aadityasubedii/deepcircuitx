    "block_comment": "This block of code instantiates an edge-sensitive trigger on the 13th bit of the `dqs_odd` signal. Whenever a positive edge (transition from 0 to 1) is detected on this bit, the `dqs_odd_receiver` function/module is invoked with the argument 12. The functionality of the block is dependent on the specifics of the `dqs_odd_receiver` function."
