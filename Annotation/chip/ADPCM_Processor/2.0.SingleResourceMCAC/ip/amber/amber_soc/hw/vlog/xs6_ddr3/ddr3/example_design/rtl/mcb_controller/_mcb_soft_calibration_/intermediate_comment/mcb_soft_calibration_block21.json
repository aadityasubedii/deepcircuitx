    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for setting up the memory write operation with a positive edge input delay (PosEdgeInDly). It initiates a write mode (WRITE_MODE) in the memory cell addressed by IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR and sets the write data to an initial delay value defined by DQS_DELAY_INITIAL. After this, it assigns the UI Address (UIADDR) to the IOI_LDQS_CLK and sets the command valid (CMD_VALID) signal to true. The system state transition is controlled by the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal. If MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is high, the system remains in the current state, otherwise it transitions to LDQS_WAIT1 state."
