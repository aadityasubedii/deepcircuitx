    "block_comment": "The function `get_rtt_wr` calculates the RTT_WR value by dividing the external resistor value with the RTT. The implementation combines the two bit RTT input into a three bit number by adding a zero at the least significant position, and then uses this three bit number as the denominator for a division operation with the defined RZQ value to compute the output."
