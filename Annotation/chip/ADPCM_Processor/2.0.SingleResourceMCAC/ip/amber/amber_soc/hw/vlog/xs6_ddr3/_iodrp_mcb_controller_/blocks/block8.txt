Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is for a counter that increments on every positive edge of the DRP_CLK clock signal, provided the system is neither in the ADDR_PHASE nor in the DATA_PHASE state and the sync_rst signal is not asserted. The counter is implemented as a 3-bit register named 'bit_cnt'. When the system is either in the ADDR_PHASE or DATA_PHASE and the sync_rst signal is not asserted, 'bit_cnt' register increments its value by 1 on positive edges of DRP_CLK. However, if the system is not in the ADDR_PHASE or DATA_PHASE state, or if the sync_rst signal is asserted, this register will be cleared.
