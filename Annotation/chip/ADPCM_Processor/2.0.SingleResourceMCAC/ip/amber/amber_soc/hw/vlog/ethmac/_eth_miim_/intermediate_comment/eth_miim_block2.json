    "block_comment": "This Ethernet shift register block, `eth_shiftreg`, primarily functions as an intermediary for processing and transferring Ethernet data. The implementation leverages a few key signals such as clock (`Clk`), reset (`Reset`), MDI (`Mdi`), FIAD (`Fiad`), RGAD (`Rgad`), control data (`CtrlData`), write operation (`WriteOp`), byte select (`ByteSelect`), and latch byte (`LatchByte`). By manipulating these inputs, the `eth_shiftreg` can successfully transmit `ShiftedBit`. This block also handles exception situations through a `LinkFail` signal and provides status updates via `Prsd` signal."
