    "block_comment": "This block of code is aimed at assigning default values to the system flags and moving the state of the system to 'DONE' or 'START' under different conditions. The 'DONE' sub-block turn off system reset and memory control block User Interface command enable, while pointing the state to 'DONE'. On the other hand, the 'default' sub-block sets more comprehensive default values to a wider range of system control and memory control flags, reseting data and address values and disabling additional features like backstore utilization. The state in 'default' condition is directed back to 'START'."
