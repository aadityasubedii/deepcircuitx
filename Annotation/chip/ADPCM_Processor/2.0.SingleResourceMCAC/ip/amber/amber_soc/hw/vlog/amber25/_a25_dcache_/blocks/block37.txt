Comment: 
The block of code is executing the function of determining if the system is idle and a write operation has been hit or not. Firstly, the first line uses a bitwise reduction OR on the `data_hit_way` to output a single bit value `idle_hit` which is true when at least one bit in `data_hit_way` is high, indicating that the system is idle. Then, the second line generates the `write_hit` signal which is true when `request_hold`, `i_write_enable` and `idle_hit` are all high, indicating that a write request is on hold, writing is enabled, and the system is idle.
