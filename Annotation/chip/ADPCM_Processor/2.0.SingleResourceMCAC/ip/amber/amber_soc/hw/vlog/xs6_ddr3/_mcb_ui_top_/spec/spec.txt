Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level wrapper for a memory controller block (MCB) with user interface (UI) functionality. It integrates various components including AXI interfaces, arbitration logic, and a raw MCB wrapper. The module supports up to 6 ports that can be configured as either native MCB interfaces or AXI interfaces. It handles clock management, address translation, and data flow between the user interfaces and the memory controller. Input ports include clock signals, reset, calibration controls, user interface commands, port-specific signals for native MCB interfaces, and AXI interface signals. Output ports provide buffered clock and control signals, memory interface signals to connect to the DRAM, user output signals for calibration and status, port-specific signals for native MCB interfaces, and AXI interface response signals. Internal signals are used to connect the native MCB interface or A
