    "block_comment": "This block is used for generating a specific data pattern in a 64-bit wide data path under certain conditions. The conditions are determined by 'DWIDTH' and 'DATA_PATTERN' parameters. When 'DWIDTH' is set to 64 and the 'DATA_PATTERN' is either 'DGEN_HAMMER' or 'DGEN_ALL', it triggers this block. The block is clocked on the positive edge of global clock 'clk_i', ensuring synchronous operation."
