This block of code serves the purpose of updating the `end_addr_range` signal on the rising edge of the clock signal `clk_i`. The updating mechanism is such that it assigns a delayed (`#TCQ` time units delay) bitwise operation result to `end_addr_range`. The result calculation involves subtracting the product of `DWIDTH/8` and `bl_out_reg` from the input `end_addr_i` (considering only 16 least significant bits) and adding one.
