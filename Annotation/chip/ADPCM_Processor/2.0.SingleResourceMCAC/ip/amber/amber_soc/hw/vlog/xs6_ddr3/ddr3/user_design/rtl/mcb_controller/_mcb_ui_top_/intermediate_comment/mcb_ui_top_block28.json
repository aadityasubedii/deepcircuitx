    "block_comment": "This function, named 'blso', manipulates a given input bit-vector 'a' to produce a result bit-vector. The function accepts an 18-bit input, a 'shift' value, and a 'width' parameter. It first computes a working width and a shifted value. It then initializes the result to a zero bit-vector. In a loop, the input vector 'a' is effectively cycled around based on the shift value with the width constraint and the corresponding value from 'a' is placed into the respective index in the output vector. Finally, the result vector 'blso' is returned."
