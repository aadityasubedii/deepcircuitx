    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code performs a mapping function from a 16-bit input instruction to a 4-bit output (mtrans_reg2). The mapping is based on the position of the first '1' in the instruction from the least significant bit (LSB). The output is a 4-bit value ranging from '0' to 'e', each corresponding to the position detection. If no '1' is detected, the default output is 'f'. The casez statement, with '?' as a wildcard and bitwise negation of mtrans_reg2_mask, provides the necessary conditional branching for this implementation."
