It handles both memory write and read operations. The module features an interface that connects to a device operating on Wishbone protocol (a standard bus protocol widely used in embedded systems). It uses wires and registers to handle read and write data, including byte selection. In the case of XILINX FPGA and XILINX SPARTAN6 FPGA, it includes respective boot file parameters based on defined directives. AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG is a directive used for debug mode, introducing a jitter effect on read and write starting processes. Based on the configuration, this module calls either generic_sram_byte_en or xs6_sram_1024x128_byte_en for memory access operations. This module also controls acknowledgements and error signalling for Wishbone operations, and supports debug operations."
