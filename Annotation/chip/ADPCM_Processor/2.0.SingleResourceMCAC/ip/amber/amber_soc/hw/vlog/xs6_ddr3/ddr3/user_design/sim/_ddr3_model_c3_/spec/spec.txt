Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module implements a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM memory device. It simulates the functionality and timing characteristics of a DDR3 memory, including command decoding, address handling, read/write operations, and various timing checks. The module has input ports for clock (ck, ck_n), control signals (cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank inputs (ba, addr), data inputs/outputs (dq, dqs, dqs_n), and other control signals (rst_n, dm_tdqs, odt). It has one output port (tdqs_n) for termination data strobe. Internally, the module uses numerous signals to track timing parameters, operation modes, and memory states. These include clock timing variables, latency counters, bank status registers
