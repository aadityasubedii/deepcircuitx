    "block_comment": "This block of code invokes a check for positive timing of the 28th element in the `dqs_in` array, which is a data quick-switch (DQS) signal, upon every falling edge of it (usually read command). It does so through the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function that is assumed to take an integer input, representing the index of the DQS signal to perform the check on, in an asynchronous manner."
