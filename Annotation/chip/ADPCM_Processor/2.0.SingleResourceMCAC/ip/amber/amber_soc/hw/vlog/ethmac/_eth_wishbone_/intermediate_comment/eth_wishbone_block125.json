    "block_comment": "This block controls the ReadTxDataFromMemory signal. It resets the signal when the system or a reset signal is detected. If conditions such as zero transmission length, transmission abort or retry pulses occur, it sets the signal to low. When a SetReadTxDataFromMemory condition occurs, it sets the ReadTxDataFromMemory signal high with a delay defined by #Tp."
