    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"iodrp_mcb_controller\" module controls a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) interface for dynamic system reconfiguration. It manages read/write operations for memory cells, controlled by input parameters. This module employs a Finite State Machine (FSM) with several states for managing different tasks. Key engineering mechanisms such as bit counting, data shifting and expanding, memory address and data holding, and control signal generation are at the heart of its implementation. It provides multiple output signals, essential for proper DRP control and data return. Furthermore, this module supports broadcasting for multiple cell operations simultaneously."
