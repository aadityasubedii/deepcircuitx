    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to control a variable called DetectionWindow, which seems be part of a larger system, possibly a signal detection or processing system. In terms of its operation, the block toggles the DetectionWindow upon certain conditions: Whenever there is a positive edge of RxReset, the DetectionWindow is set to 1 with a delay of Tp time units. When the ByteCntEq18 condition is met (which could likely indicate a complete byte has been received), DetectionWindow is immediately set to 0. Finally, when the ReceiveEnd condition becomes true, DetectionWindow is set to 1 again, suggesting the end of a receive cycle."
