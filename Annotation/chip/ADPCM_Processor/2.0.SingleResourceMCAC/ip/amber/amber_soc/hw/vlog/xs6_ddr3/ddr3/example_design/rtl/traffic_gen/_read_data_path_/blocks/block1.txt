Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code is performing a wire assignment operation. Specifically, it directs the state of the `data_error` variable to the `data_error_o` output port. Wire assignment in Verilog RTL codes is a continuous process, ensuring that any change in the source (right side - `data_error`) directly impacts the target (left side - `data_error_o`). Consequently, `data_error_o` reflects the latest state of `data_error` at all times.
