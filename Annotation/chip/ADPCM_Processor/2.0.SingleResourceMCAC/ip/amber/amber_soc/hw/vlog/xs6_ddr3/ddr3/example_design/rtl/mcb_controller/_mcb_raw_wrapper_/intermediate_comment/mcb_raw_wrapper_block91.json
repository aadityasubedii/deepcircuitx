    "block_comment": "This block manages the state of a 'normal operation window' in the program's system memory interfaces. It resets the 'normal operation window' to TRUE when a system reset is triggered. If the system enters 'self-refresh' mode at any point, it sets the 'normal operation window' to FALSE, suggesting that normal operations are halted during self-refresh. If the 'self-refresh' mode is deactivated, it resets the normal operation window to TRUE, enabling the resumption of normal operations. If none of the conditions are met, the value of 'normal_operation_window' remains unchanged."
