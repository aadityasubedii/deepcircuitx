Comment: 
This block enables a control signal whenever two conditions are met. First, the user burst count ('user_burst_cnt') equals two, indicating a burst of two data requests from the user. The second condition is that the data port FIFO is ready ('data_port_fifo_rdy' is true), and the family is either "SPARTAN6" or "VIRTEX6". The block operates on the positive edge of clk_i. When these conditions are satisfied, the 'user_bl_cnt_is_1' signal is set to high with a delay equal to TCQ; otherwise, it is set to low, also with a delay equal to TCQ.
