This block is basically a synchronous memory unit with read and write capabilities. When a rising edge is detected on the clock signal (i_clk), the block starts its operations. It first reads data from the memory location denoted by i_address. If write is enabled (i_write_enable), the block updates the memory content at the address i_address with the input data (i_write_data). If writing is not enabled, it fills the read data register (o_read_data) with zeroes. This makes it essentially a multiplexer that chooses between zero-filled and the memory content based on the write enable signal.
