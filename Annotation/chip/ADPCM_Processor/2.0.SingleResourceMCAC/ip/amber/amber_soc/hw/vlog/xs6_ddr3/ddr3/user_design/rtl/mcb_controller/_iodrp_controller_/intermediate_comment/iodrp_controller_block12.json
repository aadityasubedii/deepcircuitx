    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for mapping the current state to a corresponding ASCII string to facilitate readability and debug. This is done with a switch-case construct that checks the current state and assigns the state_ascii variable with the required ASCII representation of that state. For instance, when the state is in the 'READY' mode, it assigns the string \"READY\" to the state_ascii variable, and so on for each case."
