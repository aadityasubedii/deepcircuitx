    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the seventh bit of the 'Random' register based on the condition of 'RetryCnt'. It uses a ternary conditional operation to check if 'RetryCnt' is greater than 6. If 'RetryCnt' is greater than 6, the seventh bit of 'Random' is assigned the same value as the seventh bit of 'x'. If 'RetryCnt' is not greater than 6, the seventh bit of 'Random' is assigned a value of 0."
