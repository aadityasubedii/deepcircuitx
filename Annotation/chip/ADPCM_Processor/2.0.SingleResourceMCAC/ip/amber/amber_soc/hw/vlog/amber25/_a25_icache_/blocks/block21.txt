This block is a function that selects and returns a way (referred to as 'pick_way') from the valid bits supplied as an input. If the first bit of 'valid_bits' is 0, 'pick_way' is set to '2'b01'. If the first bit is not 0 but the second is, 'pick_way' is set to '2'b10'. If neither are 0, 'pick_way' is determined based on the value of 'random_num[3:1]' with certain values mapping to '2'b10' and all others to '2'b01'.
