    "block_comment": "This block of verilog code dynamically generates I/O buffers for interfacing data pins to the Memory Controller Block (MCB) in a memory subsystem. It uses Verilog's generate construct to create `C_NUM_DQ_PINS` instances of an `IOBUF` module, which is a built-in buffer module. Each instance is associated with a unique data pin so the exact number of instances corresponds with the constant `C_NUM_DQ_PINS`. The input and output signals, defined as `ioi_dq` and `in_pre_dq`, as well as the tristate control signal `t_dq`, are all indexed respectively to match each data pin."
