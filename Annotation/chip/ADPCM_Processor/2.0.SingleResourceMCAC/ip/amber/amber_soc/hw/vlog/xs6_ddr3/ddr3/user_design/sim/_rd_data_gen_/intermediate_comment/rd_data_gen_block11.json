    "block_comment": "This block is used to control the user burst count in specific FPGA families (Spartan6 and Virtex6). The user burst count is set to 1 when certain conditions are met: the user burst count equals 2, the data port FIFO is ready ('data_port_fifo_rdy'), and the FPGA family is either Spartan6 or Virtex6. If these conditions are not met, the user burst count is set to 0. This logic is implemented using an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock, and an if-else statement to check the defined conditions and set the user burst count accordingly."
