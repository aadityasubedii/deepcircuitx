    "block_comment": "The block assigns a Boolean value to the signal `cmp_data_valid` based on the FPGA family and memory burst length. If the family is \"SPARTAN6\", `cmp_data_valid` is assigned the value of `cmp_data_en`. In case of \"VIRTEX6\" with a memory burst length of 4, it takes the value of `v6_data_cmp_valid`, and in all other cases, it defaults to the value of `data_valid_i`."
