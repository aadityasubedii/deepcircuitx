    "block_comment": "This block of code serves to initialize an array named 'cmd_addr_string' with strings representing control and address signals for a memory interface system. The initialization is done during the initial stage of system simulation. This array will later be used to debug or validate the functionality of the memory subsystem, because it gives a readable name to address and control signals. The strings include labels for chip select, row address strobe, column address strobe, write enable, bank addresses and multiple address lines."
