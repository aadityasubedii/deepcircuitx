    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is used for assigning the signal or variable 'conflict' to the output 'o_conflict'. Essentially, this means that 'o_conflict' is configured to reflect the current state of 'conflict'. This assignment is continually updated as 'conflict' changes due to other parts of the system, thereby ensuring 'o_conflict' always mirrors the status of 'conflict'. The assignment operation is implemented by simply associating 'conflict' with 'o_conflict' using the Verilog `assign` keyword."
