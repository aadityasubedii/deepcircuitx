    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to implement a control structure for a process that signals when it is done waiting. The block works by using a sequence of conditional statements under a clock cycle to determine the value of 'wait_done'. The value of 'wait_done' goes high when reset is called or if the wait count reaches zero. However, when there's a valid command and the command is ready, or neither of the conditions is true, 'wait_done' goes low. The time-constant #TCQ ensures that the changes in 'wait_done' signal propagate after a certain delay which mimics hardware behavior."
