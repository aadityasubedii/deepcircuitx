Module-level comment: The iodrp_mcb_controller is a memory management module that handles reading from and writing to specified memory addresses in an IO routing system. It uses input signals to manage operations like data broadcasting, command validation, and indicating read or write operations. The module uses internal signals and registries for maintaining state changes and bit positions during memory access. It leverages tasks for handling incoming serialized data and control structures for transitioning between various states like READY, DECIDE, DATA_PHASE, etc. The module provides output signals to control data reading, address write enable, and serialized data input to the DRP.
