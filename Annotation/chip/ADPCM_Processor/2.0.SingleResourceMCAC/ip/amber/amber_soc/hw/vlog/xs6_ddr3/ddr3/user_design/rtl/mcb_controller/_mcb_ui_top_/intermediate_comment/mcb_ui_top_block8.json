    "block_comment": "This code block primarily performs the orchestrating of memory operations for a Spartan6 family device via neaby AXI interface. It initializes two modules, `mcb_ui_top_synch` and `axi_mcb`. The `mcb_ui_top_synch` module synchronizes the 'done' signal of memory calibration with the AXI clock. It monitors the 'uo_done_cal' signal, if this signal is active it will make the 'calib_done_synch' signal active in the next clock cycle. The 'axi_mcb' module manages reads and writes from and to the MCB of a Spartan6 device. It contains parameters to set up the AXI properties and behaviour accordingly. It interfaces with the AXI bus directly, managing the address, data and the arbiter between read and write operations on the MCB. It also handles memory errors, buffers and size configurations."
