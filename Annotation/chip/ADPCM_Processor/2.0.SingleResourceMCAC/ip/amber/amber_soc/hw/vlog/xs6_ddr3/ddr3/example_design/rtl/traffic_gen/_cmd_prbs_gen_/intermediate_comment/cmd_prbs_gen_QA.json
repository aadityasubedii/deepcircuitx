It is parameterized by command type (PRBS_CMD), pseudo-random binary sequence width (PRBS_WIDTH), seed width (SEED_WIDTH), and others. Depending on the command (\"ADDRESS\", \"INSTR\", \"BLEN\"), different kinds of pseudo-random binary sequences are generated. Operation is mainly implemented in three generate-if blocks, and they correspond to different PRBS_CMD condition checks. For \"INSTR\" and \"BLEN\", 20-bit shift register is used, while for \"ADDRESS\", either 32-bit or 64-bit shift register is used.-"

The clk_i is used to synchronize the operation, prbs_seed_init is used to start the operation and load the initial seed, clk_en allows or pauses the computation, and prbs_seed_i provides the initial seed for the PRBS generator.\n\nOutput ports:\n\n1. prbs_o: This is the output of the pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS).
