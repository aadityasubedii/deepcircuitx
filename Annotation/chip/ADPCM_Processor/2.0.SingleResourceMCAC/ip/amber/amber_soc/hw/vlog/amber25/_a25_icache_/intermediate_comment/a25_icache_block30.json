    "block_comment": "This block of code is a conditional generation block in a Verilog program, implementing a construct based on the value of WAYS. If the 'WAYS' variable holds the value 2, the block inside `:valid_bits_2ways` gets activated. This block aims to dynamically modify the hardware design based on the parameter 'WAYS', which controls the number of ways in a set-associative cache, in this case being two. It provides flexibility in hardware design, optimizing the use of resources based on the needs of the application."
