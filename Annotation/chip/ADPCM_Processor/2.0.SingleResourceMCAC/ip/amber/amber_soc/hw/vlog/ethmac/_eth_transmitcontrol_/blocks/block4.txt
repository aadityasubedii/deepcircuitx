Comment: 
This block controls a Byte Counter in a system, with the gating dictated by the system clock (MTxClk) or reset signal (TxReset). The counter's value is set to zero upon reception of a reset signal, either `TxReset` or `ResetByteCnt`. The counter value increments by 2 when `IncrementByteCntBy2` and `EnableCnt` are both active, otherwise, increments by 1 if `IncrementByteCnt` and `EnableCnt` are active. The updating of the counter is synchronous to the rising edge of the system clock or system reset.
