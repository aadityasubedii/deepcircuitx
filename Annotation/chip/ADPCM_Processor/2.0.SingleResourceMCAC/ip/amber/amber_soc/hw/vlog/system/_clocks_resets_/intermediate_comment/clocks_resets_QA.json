It has inputs for board reset (`i_brd_rst`), board clock negative (`i_brd_clk_n`), board clock positive (`i_brd_clk_p`), and DDR calibration done (`i_ddr_calib_done`). It generates output for system reset (`o_sys_rst`), system clock (`o_sys_clk`), and 200 MHz clock (`o_clk_200`). \nThe system reset is asserted when either reset signal `rst0` is high or `calib_done_33mhz` is low. \nThe clocks are generated based on various factors such as the PLL lock state and are adjusted based on specific FPGA devices like XILINX SPARTAN6 FPGA or XILINX VIRTEX6 FPGA. \nThe module uses a synchronization mechanism to handle input and system reset signals with the system clock.\nIn cases where a XILINX FPGA is not being used, it uses a behavioral model to generate system clock signals."

It's part of a differential clock input, providing an inverted clock signal.\n3. `i_brd_clk_p`: This is the board clock positive signal.
