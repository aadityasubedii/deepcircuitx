    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code performs error checking in a cache system with multiple ways. It runs at each positive edge of clock (`i_clk`), ensuring the data hits in the cache are not in more than one way at a time. If there are simultaneous hits in more than one way (`data_hit_way[0] + data_hit_way[1] > 4'd1`), it reports an error via the testbench (`TB_ERROR_MESSAGE`) and provides a display message (\"Hit in more than one cache ways!\")."
