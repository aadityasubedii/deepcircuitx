Comment: 
This function calculates the absolute value of a real number. It takes a real number as input, and if the number is less than zero, multiplies it by -1.0 to turn it into a positive number. If the number is already positive (i.e., greater than or equal to zero), it simply returns the input as it is. This function leverages Verilog's control-flow statement 'if' for determining the return value.
