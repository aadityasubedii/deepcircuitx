    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a synchronous error checking and reporting mechanism in a digital design. Detailed storage and update of error data occurs on the rising edge of the clock signal. If either there's a reset signal or an error needs to be cleared manually, the error data byte `error_byte_r1` and the `data_error` signal are reset to zero. Otherwise, the 'error_byte_r1' is updated to the current error byte and 'data_error' is set as the logical OR of the current 'error_byte_r1'. If an error is detected, denoted by 'data_error' being high, a diagnostic message is displayed showing the expected data, received data and the time of occurrence."
