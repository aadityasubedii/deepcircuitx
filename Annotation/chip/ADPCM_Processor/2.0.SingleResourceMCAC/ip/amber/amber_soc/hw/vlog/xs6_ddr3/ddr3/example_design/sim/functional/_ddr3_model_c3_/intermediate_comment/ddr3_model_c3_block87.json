    "block_comment": "This block of code is tasked with the function of monitoring changes in the input data line (dq_in[43]) and triggering a timing check whenever there's a change. The `always @` construct allows the procedure to be sensitive to the changes in dq_in[43] and the procedure `dq_timing_check(43)` is called with an argument of 43 to perform the timing check for the specific input data line."
