    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block triggers an action on the rising edge of the dqs_odd[2] signal. The function of the block is to call the `dqs_odd_receiver` procedure with input '2' whenever there is a positive edge on the `dqs_odd[2]` signal. This behaviour is implemented using the `always @` construct which sets up an event-triggered behaviour in hardware, where the event specified is the rising edge (`posedge`) of the `dqs_odd[2]` signal."
