This code block is a flip-flop type of register that updates based on the rising edge of the clock input (clk_i). The register, named user_bl_cnt_not_1, is triggered when given two specific conditions: when the input data is valid (data_valid_i) and user block count equals one (user_bl_cnt_is_1). When these conditions are met, the register is set to 1 following a delay specified by the TCQ constant; otherwise, the register is reset to 0. The use of TCQ delay enables the flip-flop to adhere to setup and hold times, ensuring proper synchronization.
