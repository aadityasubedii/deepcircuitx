    "spec": "Module name: a25_coprocessor.\n\nModule specification: The a25_coprocessor module serves the function of a co-processor for the ARM25 microprocessor, managing cache properties and fault information. This module takes in a variety of input signals, including an input clock signal (i_clk), reset signal (i_reset), coprocessor operation stalls (i_core_stall), opcode, control register numbers and types of operations (i_copro_opcode1, i_copro_opcode2, i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, i_copro_num, i_copro_operation), write data to the coprocessor (i_copro_write_data) and fault information (i_fault, i_fault_status, i_fault_address). The module outputs data read from the coprocessor (o_copro_read_data), cache enabling signal (o_cache_enable), cache flush signal (o_cache_flush) and cacheable address area (o_cacheable_area).\n\nInternally, the module utilizes multiple signals to operate, such as cache_control, cacheable_area, updateable_area, disruptive_area, fault_status and fault_address to control and monitor various aspects of caching and fault management. Additionally, it generates signals for cache flushing and manages debugging operations.\n\nThe module's code can be divided into different sections delineated by their functionality. First, it initializes cache properties and fault information signals. Next, it controls cache properties based on the input operation codes. Then, it deals with fault occurrences. The module also responds with the corresponding output according to the type of read operation. Lastly, during debug mode, it logs reads and writes to the co-processor for all control registers. In conclusion, the a25_coprocessor manages the caching systems and fault information, providing an interface for operations and debug logs for the ARM25 microprocessor system.",

This module takes in a variety of input signals, including an input clock signal (i_clk), reset signal (i_reset), coprocessor operation stalls (i_core_stall), opcode, control register numbers and types of operations (i_copro_opcode1, i_copro_opcode2, i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, i_copro_num, i_copro_operation), write data to the coprocessor (i_copro_write_data) and fault information (i_fault, i_fault_status, i_fault_address). The module outputs data read from the coprocessor (o_copro_read_data), cache enabling signal (o_cache_enable), cache flush signal (o_cache_flush) and cacheable address area (o_cacheable_area).\n\nInternally, the module utilizes multiple signals to operate, such as cache_control, cacheable_area, updateable_area, disruptive_area, fault_status and fault_address to control and monitor various aspects of caching and fault management. Additionally, it generates signals for cache flushing and manages debugging operations.\n\nThe module's code can be divided into different sections delineated by their functionality. First, it initializes cache properties and fault information signals. Next, it controls cache properties based on the input operation codes. Then, it deals with fault occurrences. The module also responds with the corresponding output according to the type of read operation. Lastly, during debug mode, it logs reads and writes to the co-processor for all control registers. In conclusion, the a25_coprocessor manages the caching systems and fault information, providing an interface for operations and debug logs for the ARM25 microprocessor system."
