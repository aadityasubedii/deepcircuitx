    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the transition of a state machine. The state machine remains in a WAIT4 state as long as the IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N flag stays low, indicating an ongoing process. If the process is finished (i.e., IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N is high), and either ZIO_IN is low or N_Term equals the binary value of 1111111, it transitions to a new state. If the flag PNSKEW is high, it moves to the SKEW state; otherwise, it transitions to WAIT_FOR_START_BROADCAST. If none of these conditions are met, it moves to the INC_NTERM state."
