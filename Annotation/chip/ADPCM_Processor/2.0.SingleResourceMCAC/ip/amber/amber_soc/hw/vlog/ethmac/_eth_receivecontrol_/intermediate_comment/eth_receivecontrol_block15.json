    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code block controls the resetting of a byte counter. The \"assign\" keyword is employed to set the variable \"ResetByteCnt\" to the value of \"RxEndFrm\". When the variable \"RxEndFrm\" is high, this indicates the end of a frame in the received data, triggering the \"ResetByteCnt\" to reset or initialize the byte count to prepare for counting the bytes of the next data frame."
