    "block_comment": "The block assigns a value to the `und_request` signal based on certain conditions related to the `type` and `instruction` variables. More specifically, `und_request` is set to 1 when `type` is either CODTRANS or COREGOP, or when `type` is CORTRANS and the upper nibble of `instruction` is not equal to 15 (in decimal). Using `assign` clause with multiple conditions, this block forms a part of an asynchronous logic in the design."
