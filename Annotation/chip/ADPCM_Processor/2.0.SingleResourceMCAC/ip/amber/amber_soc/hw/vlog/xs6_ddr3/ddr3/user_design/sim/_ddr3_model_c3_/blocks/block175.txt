This block of code monitors for system reset events and generates error messages when the width of the reset pulse violates specified boundaries. It constantly watches for rising edges of the reset signal 'rst_n_in'. If the system $time is greater than 100000 time units, it checks if the time since the last reset (tm_rst_n) plus 100000 time units is greater than the current $time. If it is, the block generates an error message displaying the module instance, the current time, and the extent of the violation (calculated as tm_rst_n + 100000 - $time). The block finally updates 'tm_rst_n' with the current $time, denoting the time of the reset.
