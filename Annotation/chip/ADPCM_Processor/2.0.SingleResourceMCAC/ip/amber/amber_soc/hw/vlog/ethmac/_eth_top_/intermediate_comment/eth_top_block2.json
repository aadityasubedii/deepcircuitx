    "block_comment": "This block mainly acts as a synchronous reset for certain signals named `RxAbortRst_sync1` and `RxAbortRst`. Precisely, the block gets triggered at the rising edge of signal `mrx_clk_pad_i` or `wb_rst_i`. When `wb_rst_i` asserts, the signals `RxAbortRst_sync1` and `RxAbortRst` are synchronously reset. Otherwise, `RxAbortRst_sync1` is updated with the input `RxAbort_wb`, and `RxAbortRst` is updated with the value of `RxAbortRst_sync1`."
