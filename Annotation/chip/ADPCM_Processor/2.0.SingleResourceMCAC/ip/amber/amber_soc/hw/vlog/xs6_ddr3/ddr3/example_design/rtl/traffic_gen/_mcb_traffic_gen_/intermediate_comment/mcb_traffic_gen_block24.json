    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the 'dcount_rst' signal. Its function depends on the logical OR operation between the 'counts_rst' signal and the first bit of the 'rst_ra' array. It is used to reset the counter ('dcount') whenever either 'counts_rst' or the first bit of 'rst_ra' is high. Thus, it provides an additional condition to reset the counter on top of any existing conditions. This way, it enhances the control of the counter's reset mechanism in the larger design."
