    "block_comment": "The block generates word (w1data) based on command start condition and data mode. On every positive clock edge, if fifo_rdy_i is asserted or cmd_startC is enabled, it checks if the sel_w1gen_logic flag is set. If the flag is on, it uses a case switch to generate different words based on addr_i[9:5] value and data_mode value. In specific, if data_mode_i equals 4'b0101, the Verilog code invokes the Data_Gen subroutine to create data, else it calls Data_GenW0. It provides a mechanism to generate custom word data under different conditions."
