    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for the instantiation of a DDR3 memory model for a memory controller block (MCB3). The implementation uses a condition check on the number of Data-Query (DQ) pins, specifically whether they are 16. If 16 pins are present, the memory model has additional tdqs signals, which are used for the Write Leveling operation in DDR3. Thus, in case of 16 DQ pins, these extra signals are assigned, while in other cases, the model is instantiated without these signals."
