Module name: sp6_data_gen. Module specification: The sp6_data_gen module is designed to generate various data patterns for hardware testing purposes. It supports multiple data generation modes including fixed data, walking ones and zeros, sequential addresses, pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS), and hammer patterns. The module accepts inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), data mode selection (data_mode_i), PRBS seed (prbs_fseed_i), and various control signals (cmd_startA to cmd_startE, fifo_rdy_i). It outputs the generated data through data_o. Internal signals include pattern-specific data registers (prbs_data, adata, hdata, ndata, w1data), counters (walk_cnt), and shift registers (SHIFT_0 to SHIFT_7, SHIFTB_0 to SHIFT
