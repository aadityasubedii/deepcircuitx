    "block_comment": "This block of code runs a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) that generates pseudo-random binary sequences for signal processing and communication applications. Upon the positive edge of the clock signal (clk_i), the code checks whether certain conditions are met. If the PRBS seed is initialized, no eye test is to be conducted, or a reset signal is received, the LFSR is seeded with a 32-bit word formed by summing an input seed, a feature seed and a fixed value. Otherwise, if the LFSR is enabled, the feedback register shifts its content while simultaneously updating its content with bitwise XOR operations. The clever use of shift operations and XOR feedback loops enables the LFSR to create pseudo-random sequences."
