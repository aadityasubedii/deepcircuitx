Comment: 
The block sets the latency values for read and write operations in the system. It checks if a specified latency 'al' is 0. If true, it sets the additive latency to 0. Otherwise, it deducts 'al' from the CAS latency to set the new additive latency. The read latency is then updated by adding the CAS latency to the additive latency, while the write latency is updated by adding the CAS write latency to the additive latency.
