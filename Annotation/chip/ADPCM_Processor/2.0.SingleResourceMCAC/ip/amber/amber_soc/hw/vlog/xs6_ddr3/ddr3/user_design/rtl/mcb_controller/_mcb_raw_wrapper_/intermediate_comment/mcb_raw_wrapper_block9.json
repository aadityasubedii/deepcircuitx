    "block_comment": "The block of code defines an output buffer (`OBUFT`) which facilitates the transition of `we` signal from the FPGA core to the IO Pad. It has three ports: a data input (`I`), an output port (`O`), and an output enable port (`T`). Specifically, this block maps the internal `we` signal (`ioi_we`) onto the external bidirectional `we` signal (`mcbx_dram_we_n`), depending on the enable signal (`t_we`)."
