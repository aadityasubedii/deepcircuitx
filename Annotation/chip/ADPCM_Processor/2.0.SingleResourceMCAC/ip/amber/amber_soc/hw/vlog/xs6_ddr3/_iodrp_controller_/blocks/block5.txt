This block handles the state update of the address phase in a DRP (Dynamic Reconfiguration Port) which takes place on the positive edge of the DRP clock. When the system reset (`sync_rst`) is active, the address phase is set to false. Otherwise, if we're currently in the address phase, it continues unless the state equals `ALMOST_READY`. In the case when not in the address phase, it transitions to the address phase if the current state equals `ADDR_PHASE` and the `bit_cnt` equals 7 (3'b111 in binary).
