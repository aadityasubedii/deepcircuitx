    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for the assignment of output data. Implementation-wise, it operates as a multiplexer, selecting between the `memcell_addr_reg` variable and the `data_reg` variable as the input source to `data_out`. This controlled selection is dependent on the condition of `addr_data_sel_n`: when it is true, the code assigns the `memcell_addr_reg` value to the output, dropping the most significant bit and adding a zero bit at the end, and when it's false, it assigns `data_reg`, also with a zero bit appended at the end."
