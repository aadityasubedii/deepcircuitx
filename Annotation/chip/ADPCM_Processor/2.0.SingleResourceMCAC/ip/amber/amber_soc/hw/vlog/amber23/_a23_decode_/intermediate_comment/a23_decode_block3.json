    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a string literal representation to the variable `xCONTROL_STATE` based on the current value of `control_state`. It uses a cascading chain of ternary operations (? :), which is a shorthand if-else, to check for specific state values and assign corresponding strings. If the `control_state` equals to any predefined state (like `RST_WAIT1`, `RST_WAIT2`, `INT_WAIT1`, etc.), it assigns the corresponding string to the `xCONTROL_STATE`, otherwise default string `\"UNKNOWN \"` is returned. This operation helps in visibly understanding the current state of control during simulation or debugging."
