    "spec": "Module name: boot_mem128. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe boot_mem128 is a Verilog module designed to handle bootstrap memory of size 128. It facilitates both memory read and write operations, interfacing with devices operating using the Wishbone protocol, a prevalent standard bus protocol widely used in embedded systems. \n\nThis module has several inputs that include the clock signal ('i_wb_clk'), the address for the Wishbone interface ('i_wb_adr'), the byte selector ('i_wb_sel'), the write enable input signal ('i_wb_we'), the input data for memory write operations ('i_wb_dat'), and two other control signals ensuring data integrity - 'i_wb_cyc' and 'i_wb_stb'. \n\nThe module outputs data read from memory operation through 'o_wb_dat', provides acknowledgment about successful read or write operation via 'o_wb_ack', and indicates any potential interfacing error with the 'o_wb_err' signal. \n\nInternally, the module uses signals like 'start_write', 'start_read', 'read_data', 'write_data', 'byte_enable', and 'address' to assist in memory operations. In debug mode, the optional 'jitter_r' and customized 'start_read_r' signals are used to introduce jitter effects and hold the status of read operations, respectively. \n\nWithin the code, separate blocks are defined based on the presence of 'AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG' and 'XILINX_FPGA' flags. These blocks help in creating a more dynamic module that can behave differently based on the defined directives. 'AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG' introduces a jitter effect to the operations, and 'XILINX_FPGA' calls a different module for memory access operations. The inclusion of different boot file parameters based on the presence of 'XILINX_FPGA' and 'XILINX_SPARTAN6_FPGA' directives adds another level of customization. \n\nIn conclusion, the boot_mem128 module is a flexible and customizable Verilog module designed for managing bootstrap memory operations in systems primarily using the Wishbone protocol.",

It facilitates both memory read and write operations, interfacing with devices operating using the Wishbone protocol, a prevalent standard bus protocol widely used in embedded systems. \n\nThis module has several inputs that include the clock signal ('i_wb_clk'), the address for the Wishbone interface ('i_wb_adr'), the byte selector ('i_wb_sel'), the write enable input signal ('i_wb_we'), the input data for memory write operations ('i_wb_dat'), and two other control signals ensuring data integrity - 'i_wb_cyc' and 'i_wb_stb'. \n\nThe module outputs data read from memory operation through 'o_wb_dat', provides acknowledgment about successful read or write operation via 'o_wb_ack', and indicates any potential interfacing error with the 'o_wb_err' signal. \n\nInternally, the module uses signals like 'start_write', 'start_read', 'read_data', 'write_data', 'byte_enable', and 'address' to assist in memory operations. In debug mode, the optional 'jitter_r' and customized 'start_read_r' signals are used to introduce jitter effects and hold the status of read operations, respectively. \n\nWithin the code, separate blocks are defined based on the presence of 'AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG' and 'XILINX_FPGA' flags. These blocks help in creating a more dynamic module that can behave differently based on the defined directives. 'AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG' introduces a jitter effect to the operations, and 'XILINX_FPGA' calls a different module for memory access operations. The inclusion of different boot file parameters based on the presence of 'XILINX_FPGA' and 'XILINX_SPARTAN6_FPGA' directives adds another level of customization. \n\nIn conclusion, the boot_mem128 module is a flexible and customizable Verilog module designed for managing bootstrap memory operations in systems primarily using the Wishbone protocol."
