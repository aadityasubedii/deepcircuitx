    "block_comment": "This block of code enables negative timing checks on data strobe signals at every positive edge of the 26th bit of the dqs_in signal. This is implemented using the 'always' keyword in Verilog to continuously monitor changes to the 26th bit of the dqs_in signal array. When a positive edge is detected, the function dqs_neg_timing_check is called with 25 as a parameter to perform the timing check on the signal."
