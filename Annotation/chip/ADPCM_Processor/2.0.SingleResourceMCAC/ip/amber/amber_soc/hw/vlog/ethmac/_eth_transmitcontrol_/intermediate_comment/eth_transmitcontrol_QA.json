It regulates transmission flow, aborting and completing transmission, and interacts with the MAC layer. It also includes the functionality of control frame creation, where the frame data include MAC address and pause time value, and the ability to delay the transmission. It generates signals that indicate the start and end of the control frame, whether a control frame is being sent, and whether a control frame is anticipated to be sent. Additionally, it secures that the 'done' signal for the overall transmission is blocked while a control frame is being transmitted."
