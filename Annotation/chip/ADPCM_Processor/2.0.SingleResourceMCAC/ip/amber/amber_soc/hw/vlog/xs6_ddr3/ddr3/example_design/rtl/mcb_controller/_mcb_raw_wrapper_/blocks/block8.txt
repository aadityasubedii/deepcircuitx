This block's function is to generate a reset for DDR3 memory type when the constant "C_MEM_TYPE" is equivalent to "DDR3". The implementation is through the instantiation of an output buffer (OBUFT) named `iob_rst`. The output signal mapped to DDR3 reset is denoted `mcbx_dram_ddr3_rst`, the input signal is `ioi_rst`, and the tristate control port is marked by `t_rst`.
