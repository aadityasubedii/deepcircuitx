Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for updating the command bit length (mcb_cmd_bl_r) on the rising edge of input clock (clk_i). When enable input (mcb_cmd_en_i) is high, the code updates the command bit length to be equal to the input command bit length (mcb_cmd_bl_i). This process is synchronous to the clock signal, meaning that any changes in mcb_cmd_bl_i will not take effect until the next positive clock transition if mcb_cmd_en_i is asserted.
