Comment: 
The block is a function that retrieves and returns the output value of a specified register from the "U_REGISTER_BANK" based on the input register number (regnum). It employs a case statement to map the input register number to its corresponding register. If the input is '0', it returns the output value of register 'r0'. If the input is '1', it returns the output value of register 'r1', and so forth. For special case where register number is 16 to 20, specific service registers are returned, and for register number 21, output of register 15 (r15_out_rn) is returned from "U_REGISTER_BANK".
