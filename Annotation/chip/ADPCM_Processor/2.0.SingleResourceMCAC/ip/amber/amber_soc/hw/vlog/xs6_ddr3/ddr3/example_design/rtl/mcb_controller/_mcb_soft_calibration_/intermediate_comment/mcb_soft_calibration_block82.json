    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block functions as a conditional structure within a generate statement that gets conditionally synthesized based on the value of the C_MEM_TYPE parameter. The implementation checks if the C_MEM_TYPE parameter is not equal to \"DDR2\" through the use of the \"!=\" operator. If this condition is true, an unnamed block of code labeled as 'gen_cketrain_b' is instantiated and synthesized. Please note that 'gen_cketrain_b' contains additional code (not shown here) which will further define the functionality of this block when the condition is met."
