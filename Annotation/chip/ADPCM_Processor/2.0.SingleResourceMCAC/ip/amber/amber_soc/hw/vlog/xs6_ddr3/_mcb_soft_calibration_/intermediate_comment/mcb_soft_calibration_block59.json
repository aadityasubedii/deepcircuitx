    "block_comment": "This block serves as a control unit for a WaitCountEnable signal. It triggers the signal's state based on certain conditions and the rising edge of the UI_CLK. On system reset, it sets the signal to 0. If a self-refresh request is in its second not active phase and first active phase, the signal is also set to 0. Alternatively, if start dynamic calibration after self-refresh is currently not requested but was previously requested, the signal is set to 1. If none of these conditions are met, the state of the signal remains unaltered."
