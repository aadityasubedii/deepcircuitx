    "block_comment": "This block handles system reset preparation during dynamic calibration cycles in a synchronous design. On each rising edge of UI_CLK, it checks if the current state equals to START_DYN_CAL_PRE. If the condition check passes, the pre_sysrst counter is incremented by one. Otherwise, the counter is reset to zero."
