Comment: 
The given block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for assigning the appropriate value to the `data_wdata` signal based on the current state and condition values. It leverages conditional ternary operators to decide the value of `data_wdata`. In the case where there is a write hit and the cache is idle (`c_state == CS_IDLE`), it assigns `write_hit_wdata` to `data_wdata`. When a consecutive write is happening, it instead assigns `consecutive_write_wdata` to `data_wdata`. In all other cases, `read_miss_wdata` is assigned to `data_wdata`.
