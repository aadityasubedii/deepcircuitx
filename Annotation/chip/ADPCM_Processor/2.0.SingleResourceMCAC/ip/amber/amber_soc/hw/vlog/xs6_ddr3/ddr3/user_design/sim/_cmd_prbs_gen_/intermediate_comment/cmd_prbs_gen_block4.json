    "block_comment": "This block of code sets up a conditionally activating block of code in a Verilog Hardware Description Language model (gen20_taps) when the PRBS_CMD variable matches either \"INSTR\" or \"BLEN\". The specific operation of this block is predicated on a positive edge clock signal (posedge clk_i), which initiates this block to take action. When this positive clock edge occurs and the PRBS_CMD has the specified value, the operations nested within this block will execute."
