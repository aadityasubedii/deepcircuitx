    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for meticulous timing checks of the data stream, 'dq_in' at the 3rd bit position. It is implemented using an \"always\" block in Verilog which is conditionally triggered whenever there is a change in the 3rd bit (index 3) of the 'dq_in' data stream - this event (a change in the bit) prompts a call to the function 'dq_timing_check' with '3' passed as an argument."
