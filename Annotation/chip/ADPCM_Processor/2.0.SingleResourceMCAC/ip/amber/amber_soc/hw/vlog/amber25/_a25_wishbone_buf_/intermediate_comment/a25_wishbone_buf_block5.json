    "block_comment": "This block of code is handling a write buffer operation, mediated by a clock signal (`i_clk`). On every rising edge of the clock, if a `push` signal is asserted, the block writes input data, address, byte enable signal, and write-enable signal into respective arrays. These are all indexed by the current write pointer `wbuf_wp_r`, which is subsequently toggled (`!wbuf_wp_r`) at the end of each operation. The byte enable input (`i_be`) is determined conditionally on whether a write operation (`i_write`) is in progress, with `i_be` used if so, and a hexadecimal value of 'ffff' as the default otherwise."
