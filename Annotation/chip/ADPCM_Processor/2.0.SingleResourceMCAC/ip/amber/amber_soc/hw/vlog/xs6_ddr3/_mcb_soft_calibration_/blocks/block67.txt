Comment: 
The block of code functions as an asynchronous reset and synchronous control for the `RST_reg` register. In the event of a positive edge on `UI_CLK` or `non_violating_rst`, it determines the value that will be loaded into `RST_reg`. If `non_violating_rst` is true, or `WAIT_200us_COUNTER[15]` is not set, `RST_reg` is set to 1, effectively triggering a reset. Otherwise, the value of `rst_tmp` is loaded into `RST_reg`. This dual method reset control allows for more flexibility and safety in the design's reset strategy.
