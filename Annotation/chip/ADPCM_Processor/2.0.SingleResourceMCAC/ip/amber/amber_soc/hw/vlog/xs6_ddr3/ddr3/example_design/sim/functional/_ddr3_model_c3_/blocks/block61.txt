This block of code runs a timing check on DQS (Data Strobe) signal. Whenever there's a positive edge in the DQS signal, indexed at 4, the function `dqs_pos_timing_check( 4)` is executed. This function is likely to take necessary actions based on the timing measurement of DQS for evaluating the data integrity and reliability.
