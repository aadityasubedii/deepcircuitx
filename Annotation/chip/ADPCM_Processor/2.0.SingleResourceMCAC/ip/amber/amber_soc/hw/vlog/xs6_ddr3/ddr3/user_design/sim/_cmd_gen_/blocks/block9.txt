Comment: 
This block selectively assigns input instructions to an output variable depending on a mode signal. On every positive edge of the clock, the block checks the value of the instruction mode signal, `instr_mode_i`, and depending on its value, assigns a corresponding instruction from the different input signals to the output signal `instr_out`. The various source signals used for assignments are 'bram_instr_i', 'fixed_instr_i', a manipulation of 'prbs_instr_a' and 'prbs_instr_b', and 'refresh_prbs'. The delay constant `#TCQ` is used to model setup and hold times for the assignment. A default condition is provided for unhandled instruction modes, defaulting to a manipulated 'prbs_instr_a'.
