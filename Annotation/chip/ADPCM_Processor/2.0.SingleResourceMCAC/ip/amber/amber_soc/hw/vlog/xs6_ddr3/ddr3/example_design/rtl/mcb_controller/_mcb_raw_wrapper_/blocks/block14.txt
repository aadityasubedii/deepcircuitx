This block of code is for generation of output buffering functionality for memory addressing in DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory). Each bit of the address input (ioi_addr) is passed through an instance of the OBUFT (Output Buffer) module which acts as a non-inverting buffer. The output is driven to the mcbx_dram_addr with the same bit position. It iterates over the width of the memory address (C_MEM_ADDR_WIDTH) and for each bit, it creates a separate instance of the buffer. This facilitates interfacing the core logic with the external DRAM module by ensuring higher drive strength for the address lines.
