    "block_comment": "This block of code is utilized for invoking the `cmd_addr_timing_check` function whenever there's a change in the 16th bit of the input address (`addr_in[15]`). The function `cmd_addr_timing_check` is passed the constant value 22, which could be some timing or delay parameter. The function may use this constant to analyze or manipulate the input signal, possibly for ensuring proper synchronization or timing integrity."
