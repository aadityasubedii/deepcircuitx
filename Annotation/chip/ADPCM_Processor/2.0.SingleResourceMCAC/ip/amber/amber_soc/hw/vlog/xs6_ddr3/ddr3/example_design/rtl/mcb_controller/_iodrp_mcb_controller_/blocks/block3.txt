Comment: 
This logic block in Verilog code assigns a value to the DRP_SDI register based on certain conditions. If the read operation (rd_not_write_reg) is active, the chip-select signal (DRP_CS) is high and the address bit (DRP_ADD) is low, the value of DRP_SDO is assigned to DRP_SDI. If these conditions are not met, the previous value (DRP_SDI_pre) is assigned to DRP_SDI. This control statement implements a kind of multiplexer functionality to choose the input for the DRP_SDI register based on various control signals.
