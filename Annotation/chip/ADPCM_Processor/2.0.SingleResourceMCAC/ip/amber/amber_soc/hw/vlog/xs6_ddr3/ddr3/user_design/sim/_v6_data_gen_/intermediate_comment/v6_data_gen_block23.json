    "block_comment": "The block sets conditions for a walking one data pattern setup for devices with 120 Data Query (DQ) pins. These conditions are predicated on the value of the `NUM_DQ_PINS` and `DATA_PATTERN`. The implementation achieves its functions mainly through a series of specific conditional checks: checking if the `NUM_DQ_PINS` equals to 120 and `DATA_PATTERN` equals to \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\". These conditions collectively form a more complex nested conditional setup to implement the walking one data pattern."
