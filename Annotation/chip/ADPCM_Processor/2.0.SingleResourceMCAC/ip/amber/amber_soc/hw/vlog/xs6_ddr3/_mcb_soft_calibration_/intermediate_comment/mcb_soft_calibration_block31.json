    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the readiness of the MCB module and its refresh flag. If the MCB module is busy, the state remains in the WAIT6 cycle. If the module is ready and the first input termination has been completed, the code then checks the MCB refresh flag. If the refresh flag is set, the code updates the DRP and changes the state to OFF_RZQ_PTERM. If the flag is not set, the state remains in WAIT6."
