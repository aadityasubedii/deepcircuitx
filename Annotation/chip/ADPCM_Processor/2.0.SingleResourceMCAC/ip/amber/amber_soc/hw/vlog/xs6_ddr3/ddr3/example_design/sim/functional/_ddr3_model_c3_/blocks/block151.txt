This block of code implements an always block that is sensitive to the 14th bit of the `addr_in` signal and invokes the `cmd_addr_timing_check(20)` function whenever changes occur in this bit. The purpose is to call this function to further execute verification of command address timing when there's an edge transition in the specified bit from the `addr_in` input signal.
