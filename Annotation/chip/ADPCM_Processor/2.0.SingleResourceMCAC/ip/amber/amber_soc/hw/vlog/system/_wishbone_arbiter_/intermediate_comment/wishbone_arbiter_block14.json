    "block_comment": "This block decides which Wishbone master (Master1 or Master0) to listen to by setting the various Wishbone signals (adr, sel, wdat, we, cyc, stb) based on the 'current_master' signal. The implementation employs ternary operators where, if 'current_master' is true then signals from Master1 are assigned and if 'current_master' is false then signals from Master0 are assigned."
