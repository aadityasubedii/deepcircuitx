It encapsulates various functional sub-modules such as fetch, decode, execute, memory, write back, wishbone (an interface for system interconnect) and coprocessor, which collectively implement the main stages in the instruction cycle of a processor. Inputs include clock, reset, interrupts, ready signals and datalines; outputs encompass various signals and lines for interaction with other components. The core processes incoming data and instructions, fetches and decodes instructions, executes algorithms and communicates with associated memory and the coprocessor unit. It interfaces with an external system bus through the wishbone module."
