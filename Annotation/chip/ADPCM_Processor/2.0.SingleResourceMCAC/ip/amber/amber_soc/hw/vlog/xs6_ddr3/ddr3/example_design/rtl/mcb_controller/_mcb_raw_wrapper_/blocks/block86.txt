Comment: 
The block of Verilog code manages the signals related to self-refresh request in a soft calibration circuit. When a reset signal (sys_rst) is received at the positive edge of ui_clk, it resets the soft_cal_selfrefresh_req signal to 0. Alternatively, if there's an incoming command to enter self-refresh mode (self_refresh_enter_r3), the soft_cal_selfrefresh_req signal is set to 1. If the command is not present and the phase-locked loop (pll_lock) is stable, the signal gets reset back to 0. If none of these conditions are present, the output retains its existing status.
