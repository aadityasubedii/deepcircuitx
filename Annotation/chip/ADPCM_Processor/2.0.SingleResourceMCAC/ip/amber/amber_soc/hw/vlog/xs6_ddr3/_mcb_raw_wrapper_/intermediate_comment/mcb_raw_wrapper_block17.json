    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for generating serial data output streams for each data quantization (DQ) pin. It uses the Xilinx 'OSERDES2' primitive to convert parallel data to a serial output stream. A loop is established using the 'generate' and 'for' constructs to create an 'OSERDES2' instance for each DQ pin. The parameters of the 'OSERDES2' primitive are configured appropriately, including the data rates, output mode, and data width. Specific pins such as OQ, TQ, D1 and D2 are mapped to arrays related to the DQ pins, while other signals are set to logical 0 or 1 as needed. The blocks use a 90\u00b0 clock (ioclk90) and an internal system reset (int_sys_rst). Lastly, an enable signal (dqIO_w_en_0) and a training signal (ioi_drp_train) are included in the block."
