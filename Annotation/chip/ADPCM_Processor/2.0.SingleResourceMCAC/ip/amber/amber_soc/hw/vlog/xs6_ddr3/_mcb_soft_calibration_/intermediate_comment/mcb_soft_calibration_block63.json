    "block_comment": "This block controls the SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ signal based on specific conditions. It operates on the rising edge of the UI_CLK. When a reset signal (RST) is detected, it forces the SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ signal to 0. The block also sets SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ to 0 if PLL_LOCK_R2 is high and SELFREFRESH_REQ_R3 is low. If the system is in the START_DYN_CAL state and SELFREFRESH_REQ_R3 is high, it sets the SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ signal to 1."
