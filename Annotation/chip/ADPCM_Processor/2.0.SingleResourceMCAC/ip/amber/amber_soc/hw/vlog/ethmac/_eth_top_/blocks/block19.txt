This block of code defines the instantiation of an Ethernet MAC Transmitter, eth_txethmac. The transmitter's functionalities are controlled by various input signals like Reset, CarrierSense, Collision and others. It also has output signals to indicate the status of transmission like TxUnderRun, TxEndFrm, and MTxErr. Besides, it handles parameters for network configuration such as CrcEn, MaxRet, and IPGT for flow control. The control flow is defined by signals connected to the device entity's inputs and outputs, which represent operations like frame transmission, collision detection, underrun condition and others. The network behavior is defined by parameters which manage frame length, CRC capability, backoff algorithm and collision retry count.
