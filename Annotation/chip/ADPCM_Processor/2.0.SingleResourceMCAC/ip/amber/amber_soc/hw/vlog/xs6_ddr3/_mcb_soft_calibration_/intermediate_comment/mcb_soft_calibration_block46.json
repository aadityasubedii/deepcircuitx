    "block_comment": "The block triggers a write operation to an I/O Delay Reference Plane Control Register (IODRPCTRLR). To start the operation, it sets the CMD_VALID signal to high, identifies the register's memory cell via MEMCELL_ADDR signal getting assigned the PTerm value, and stores the write data. The specific write data is formed by concatenating two '0' bits with the P_Term. The operation mode is set as WRITE_MODE by the R_WB signal. The block then either transitions the state machine to LOAD_RZQ_PTERM or WAIT2, based on the IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N signal's state."
