    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog RTL code appears to handle the configuration of memory interfaces (Ports 0 and 1) for different user interface modes (\"AXI\") and port configurations (\"B64_B64\", \"B128\"). It manages various elements such as the arbitration enable signals, read/write clocks, enable signals, data and error handling for these ports. The assignments usually depend on conditions set by user interface mode and port enable values. When a port is set to 'B64_B64', it's split into two parts sharing the same clock but with their data paths. If 'B128' is chosen, the data path is 128 bits and is split in four parts. If the port enable value is 0, all signals are set to their default values."
