    "block_comment": "The block of code implements a synchronization mechanism for calibration completion signals. A module named \"mcb_ui_top_synch\" is instantiated with a parameter, C_SYNCH_WIDTH, set to 1, indicating it's a single bit synchronization. This module takes the calibration completion signal 'uo_done_cal' as input, and after synchronization, it outputs 'calib_done_synch'. The synchronization is clocked by 's4_axi_aclk'."
