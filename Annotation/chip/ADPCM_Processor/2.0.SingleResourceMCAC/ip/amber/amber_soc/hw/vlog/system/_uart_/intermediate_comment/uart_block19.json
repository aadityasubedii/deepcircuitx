    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to control the Request to Send (RTS) signal for a UART interface. Its function is to negate the state of the reception enable (rxen) signal and assign it to the output signal for the UART's RTS line (o_uart_rts_n). This is achieved using the assign keyword to continuously update the output state of o_uart_rts_n with the negated (~) state of rxen. Therefore, RTS is low (active state) when reception is enabled and vice versa."
