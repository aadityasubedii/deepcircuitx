Comment: 
This block of code defines the operation of a UART transmission unit, controlling the state and behaviour of the transmission sequence. It operates synchronously with the UART clock, and an active-low reset signal resets all the variables. The control flow depends on a state machine with three states: idle (0), transmitting (1), and ending transmission (2). In the idle state, if a start condition is present and the transmission FIFO is not empty, it grabs a byte from the FIFO and moves to the transmitting state. In the transmitting state, it sends the bits of the byte serially. If it finishes transmitting all bits, it moves to the ending transmission state, where it resets the transmission state to idle, preparing for the next byte.
