    "block_comment": "This block is used to set up the broadcasting of termination parameters to memory cells. It works by assigning the termination parameter address and write data values, and by enabling the Write mode, MCB command validity, and MCB back store usage. The MCB UIDRPUPDATE value is also inverted based on whether or not it's the first termination done. Following that, depending on the status of MCB_RDY_BUSY_N, the state will continue at BROADCAST_NTERM or proceed to WAIT6."
