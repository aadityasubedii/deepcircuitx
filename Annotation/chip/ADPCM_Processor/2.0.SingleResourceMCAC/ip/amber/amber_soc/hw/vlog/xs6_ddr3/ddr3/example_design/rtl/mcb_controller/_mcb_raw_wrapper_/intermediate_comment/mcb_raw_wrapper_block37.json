    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for implementing a delay function, specifically a mechanism to wait for 200 microseconds. The mechanism involves the use of a 15-bit binary counter, 'wait_200us_counter'. When the counter reaches a specific value, denoted by the 14th and 13th bit being high (both '1'), a flag named 'wait_200us_done_r1' is set to '1'. Otherwise, the flag is kept at '0'. Also, the value of 'wait_200us_done_r1' is always transferred to 'wait_200us_done_r2' at the rising edge of the 'ui_clk' clock pulse."
