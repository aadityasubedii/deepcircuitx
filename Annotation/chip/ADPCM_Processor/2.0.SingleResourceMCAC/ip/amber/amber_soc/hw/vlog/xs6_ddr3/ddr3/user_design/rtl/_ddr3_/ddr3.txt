Module-level comment: 
/* 
This module implements a DDR3 memory controller interface. It instantiates 
infrastructure and memory controller wrapper submodules to handle DDR3 SDRAM 
operations. The module provides multiple configurable command, write, and read 
ports (p0-p5) for interfacing with DDR3 memory. It manages clock generation, 
reset control, and PLL operations, and handles memory calibration and various 
DDR3 interface signals. The module is highly parameterized to allow flexible 
configuration of timing, port settings, and memory characteristics.
