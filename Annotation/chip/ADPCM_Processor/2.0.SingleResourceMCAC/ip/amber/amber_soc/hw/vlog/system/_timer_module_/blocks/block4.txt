Comment: 
This block of code manages a trio of timers (timer0, timer1, and timer2) in a system, marking and controlling the clock cycles and increments for the timers. It responds to 'write' signals to update the timer control registers, load registers, or clear interrupts. The code monitors the status of each timer; if the timer's value reaches zero, it checks whether the control registry bit [6] (auto-reload) is set. If it's set, the timer value reloads with the preset load registry value, otherwise, it reverts to its max value (24'hffffff). For decrement operations, it uses the control register [3:2] bits to select the decrement rate. If an unknown prescale value is encountered, an error message is generated. Additionally, it features interrupt clearing by setting timer interrupt registers to zero on receiving a 'write' command, or setting them to '1' when the timer value hits zero.
