Instantiating a DDR3 controller and memory model\n3. Setting up test parameters and signals\n4. Running a test sequence with error checking\n5. Monitoring calibration and initialization processes\n6. Logging test results (pass/fail)\nThe testbench uses internal signals to connect components and verify correct operation of the DDR3 controller.\n*/"
