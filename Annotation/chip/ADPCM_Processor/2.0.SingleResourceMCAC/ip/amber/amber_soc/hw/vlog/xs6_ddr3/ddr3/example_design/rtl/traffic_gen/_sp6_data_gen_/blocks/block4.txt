The block of code is a conditional logic trigger predicated upon the string content of DATA_PATTERN variable. If DATA_PATTERN matches either "DGEN_ADDR" or "DGEN_ALL", the code block labeled as ADDRESS_PATTERN gets executed. This piece of code is part of a generate construct used for creating configurable designs or datapaths in RTL design.
