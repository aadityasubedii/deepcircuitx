    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'infrastructure' module handles clock signals, reset operations, and generates internal clocks in a FPGA design. It uses FPGA primitives like IBUFGDS, IBUFG, and PLL_ADV for clock signal conditioning and multiplication/division. It also provides synchronous and asynchronous reset operations. Different types of clock signals and PLL lock status are managed using internal signals. The module allows conditional instantiation of either a differential or single-ended input clock signal. The PLL block generates various clock signals with different frequencies and phases. The synchronous and asynchronous resets are also generated based on PLL lock status."
