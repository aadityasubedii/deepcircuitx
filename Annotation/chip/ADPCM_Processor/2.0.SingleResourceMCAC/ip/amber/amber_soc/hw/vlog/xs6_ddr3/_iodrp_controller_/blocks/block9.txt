This block of code is a multiplexer for selecting between memory cell address and data output. Depending upon the state of the selector signal 'addr_data_sel_n', which serves as the multiplexer control signal, either the value from 'memcell_addr_reg' (address register) or 'data_reg' (data register) is routed to 'data_out_mux'. When 'addr_data_sel_n' is high, data from the memory cell address register is selected; otherwise, data from the data register is selected.
