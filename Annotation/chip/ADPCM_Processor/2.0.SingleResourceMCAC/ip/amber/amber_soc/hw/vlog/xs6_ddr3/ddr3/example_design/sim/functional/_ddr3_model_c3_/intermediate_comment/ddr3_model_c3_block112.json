    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block triggers a function `dq_timing_check` every time there is a change in the 18th bit of the `dq_in` input. To achieve this, it employs an always block `@(dq_in[18])` which serves as an edge-triggered event control mechanism. Whenever there is a change in the state of the `dq_in[18]`, regardless of it being a rising edge or falling edge, the call to function `dq_timing_check(18)` is made. This specific bit might be critical in the scheme of the entire design, and its change of state might require specific actions to be performed for appropriate functioning of the hardware."
