    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code controls the internal read path data validity signal, `rdpath_data_valid_i`. If the targeted FPGA family is VIRTEX6 and the memory burst length (`MEM_BLEN`) is 4, it sets `rdpath_data_valid_i` to be logically high one clock cycle before the `rd_mdata_fifo` read FIFO buffer is full (`rd_mdata_afull_set`). This stops the read operation when the read FIFO is full, allowing for burst reads. For other FPGA families or burst lengths, it just checks that the memory controller's read buffer isn't empty (`!mcb_rd_empty`)."
