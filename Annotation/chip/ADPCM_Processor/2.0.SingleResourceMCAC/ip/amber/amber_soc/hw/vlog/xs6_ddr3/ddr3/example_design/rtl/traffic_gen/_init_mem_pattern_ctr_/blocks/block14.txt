This block of code is responsible for capturing and holding the memory controller command bus length (mcb_cmd_bl) value synchronously with the clock (clk_i). It uses a rising edge-sensitive always block to update the cmd_bl_r register only when command enable (mcb_cmd_en_i) input signal is high during a clock posedge transition.
