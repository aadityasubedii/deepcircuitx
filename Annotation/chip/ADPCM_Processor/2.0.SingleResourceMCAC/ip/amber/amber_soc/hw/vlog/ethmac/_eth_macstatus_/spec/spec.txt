Module name: eth_macstatus. 

Module specification: The eth_macstatus module is designed to monitor and manage the status of an Ethernet communication transaction in a Media Access Control (MAC) subsystem. This module latches and manages various flag signals, counters, and states associated with the MAC controller, specifically for Ethernet reception (Rx) and transmission (Tx) sides. Its primary role is to assure high quality and reliable data transmission by tracking and managing different aspects of the Ethernet communication like CRC errors, frame lengths, receiver/transmitter states, collision states, and retry count.

The input ports of the module include various clock signals, error indicators, state signals, counters, indicators of the transmitting and receiving status among others. Some of the important ones are the MRxClk (the clock for the receiving side), Reset (Signal to reset the module), MRxDV (Receive data valid signal), RxByteCnt (input counter representing the received byte count), and MTxClk (Clock for the transmitting side).

The output ports are more focused on the transmission statuses and error conditions. These include ReceivedLengthOK, ReceivedPacketGood (signals that depict the quality of received packet), ReceiveEnd (signal indicating the end of reception), RetryCntLatched (the latched version of RetryCnt), InvalidSymbol (indicator for incorrect symbol received), and others.

Internally, the module operates with a set of signals like ReceiveEnd, LatchedMRxErr, LatchedCrcError, LoadRxStatus, InvalidSymbol, RetryCntLatched, RetryLimit, and so on. These signals either hold the values of certain conditions or states, or direct the module to take action based on different conditions.

The code can be broken down into different sections based on behavioral and sequential logic, clocked by both the Rx and Tx sides. These sections range from resetting and latching error signals, setting conditions for received packet quality, managing carrier sense during transmission, to managing collision during reception. Overall, it offers a robust set of features for accurate status tracking and reporting associated with Ethernet reception and transmission.
