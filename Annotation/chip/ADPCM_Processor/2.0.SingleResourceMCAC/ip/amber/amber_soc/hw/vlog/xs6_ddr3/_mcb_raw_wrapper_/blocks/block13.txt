This block is responsible for generating output buffer for memory address in a digital system. It does this by looping through each bit of an input memory address, and creating an instance of the output buffer module `OBUFT` for it. The `OBUFT` is a commonly used component in Verilog for output driving with 3-state control, where `.I` is the input, `.T` is the output enable control, and `.O` is the driven output. Here, `ioi_addr` is the input address, `t_addr` functions as the control signal and `mcbx_dram_addr` captures the output. This design pattern is often used to drive the same address bus from multiple sources/interfaces, as it allows the address lines to be effectively connected and disconnected.
