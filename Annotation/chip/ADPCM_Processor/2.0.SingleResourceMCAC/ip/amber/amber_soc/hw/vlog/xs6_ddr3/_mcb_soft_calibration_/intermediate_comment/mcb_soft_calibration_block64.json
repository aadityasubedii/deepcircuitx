    "block_comment": "The block of code essentially manages the state of a multi-stage synchronous self-refresh and phase-locked loop (PLL) lock system for a memory controller block (MCB). The logic becomes active at positive edge of UI clock or a reset. On a reset signal, it sets all stages of SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE, SELFREFRESH_REQ, and PLL_LOCK signals to zero, effectively resetting the system. Otherwise, it shifts the respective system's signals down each stage, creating a three-stage delay pipeline for SELFREFRESH, and a two-stage delay pipeline for PLL_LOCK signals."
