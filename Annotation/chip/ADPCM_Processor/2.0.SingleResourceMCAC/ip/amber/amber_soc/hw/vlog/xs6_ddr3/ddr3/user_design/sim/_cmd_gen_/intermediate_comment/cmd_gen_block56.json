    "block_comment": "This block's primary function is to set the status of various control signals in synchronization with the positive edge of the clock. It employs delay modeling with a time constant queue (#TCQ) in order to ensure the signals' statuses are updated at the right time. The control signals' states are updated based on logical conditions involving other control signals like cmd_clk_en, mode_load_pulse, first_load_pulse, and bl_out_clk_en."
