    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code dictates the synchronization of a shift operation's end signal, 'ShiftEndedSync3'. The code is triggered at the positive edge of a write-back clock signal, 'WB_CLK_I', or upon a reset signal. When a reset signal is received, the shift ended sync signal, 'ShiftEndedSync3' is set to 0. When both 'ShiftEndedSync1' is true and 'ShiftEndedSync2' is false, 'ShiftEndedSync3' is set to 1 high, indicating a successful synchronization. If a shift operation ends unsynchronized, indicated by 'ShiftEnded' being true, 'ShiftEndedSync3' is reset to 0 low."
