    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe `a23_coprocessor` module is responsible for managing cache-related operations through opcode signals. Input ports receive clock signals, operation types, data, fault info, while output ports manifest module read data, cache status and control data. Internal signals control cache areas, faults, and operations. Main tasks include handling of fault conditions, cache control, and debugging with read/write data visibility."
