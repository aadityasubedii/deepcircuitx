    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a part of a `generate-if` construct, used to select different architectures at synthesis time. The block's function is to assign value to the signal `next_way` based on the `pick_way` function output in a dual-way configuration, as specified by the condition `WAYS == 2`. `pick_way` is a function which uses `valid_bits_r` and `random_num` as inputs."
