    "block_comment": "This block of code is a part of a synchronous system, performing the function of a flip-flop that latches the `start_read` signal value at the positive edge of the `i_wb_clk` clock signal. It is implemented using an `always` block in Verilog, which runs whenever there's a rising edge in the clock cycle. A positive edge-triggered flip-flop design is used in the block so that the value of `start_read` is stored in `start_read_r` at each 'tick' of the clock cycle, further following an edge-triggered methodology."
