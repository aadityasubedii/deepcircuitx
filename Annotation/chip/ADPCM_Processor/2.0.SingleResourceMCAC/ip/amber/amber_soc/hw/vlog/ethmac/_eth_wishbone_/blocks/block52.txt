Comment: 
This block of code defines the status of a write operation in a receiver data path of a serial communication interface. The write operation's status, referred to as 'RxStatusWrite', is the bitwise AND operation between 'ShiftEnded', 'RxEn', and 'RxEn_q'. The operation occurs only when a shift operation ends ('ShiftEnded' is high), the receiver is enabled ('RxEn' is high), and the condition of the receiver-enabling in the previous clock cycle ('RxEn_q' is high).
