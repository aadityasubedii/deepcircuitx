    "block_comment": "This block is for updating various signals on the rising edge of the clock. These signals are only updated when there's an update flag present for each signal. If an update flag such as 'daddress_update' or 'exec_load_rd_update' is active, then the corresponding value from the '_nxt' signal is taken. Otherwise, the signal retains its current value. This allows selective updating of registers, with the relevant new values stored in '_nxt' signal ready for the update. This ensures synchronization and correct timing in the system as it only allows updates at the correct clock cycle."
