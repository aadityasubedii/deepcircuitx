This block of Verilog code is tied to a specific bit of the dq_in signal and executes whenever this bit changes values. It calls the function dq_timing_check with parameter 33. The function dq_timing_check is likely to perform a variety of timing checks on bit 33 of the dq_in data queue. The register dq_in (data queue input) seems to be a multi bit wide signal, as the code refers to its 33rd bit specifically. By using 'always @', the function dq_timing_check will continuously monitor the bit 33 of dq_in and is executed on any change of state.
