    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for signaling when a state machine is in the `READY` state. This is achieved by using a conditional assignment, where `rdy_busy_n` is assigned a boolean value depending on whether the current state (`state`) of the state machine matches `READY`. If `state` equals `READY`, `rdy_busy_n` returned as true, signaling that the system is ready."
