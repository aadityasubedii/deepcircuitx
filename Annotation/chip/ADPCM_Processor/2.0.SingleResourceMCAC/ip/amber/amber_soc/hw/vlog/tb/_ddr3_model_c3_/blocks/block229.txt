This block is a function that retrieves the nominal round trip time (rtt) based on input. The function, get_rtt_nom, takes a 3-bit input, `rtt`, evaluates it using a case statement to select corresponding output value. The function assigns the global constant `RZQ` divided by a specific number (4, 2, 6, 12, 8 respectively) as the function's output for different rtt input values (1 to 5), if the `rtt` input is not within the range 1 to 5, the function will return a default output of 0.
