    "block_comment": "This Verilog block operates as a control module for adjusting delay within some system constraints. The Verilog block employs conditional matching to execute various controls, such as decreasing delay and setting states, based on the `Inc_Dec_REFRSH_Flag` value and the `DQS_DELAY` value. If `DQS_DELAY` is not '00', then depending on the flag, it increases a `counter_dec`, sets a `STATE` to decrement, or starts a dynamic calibration process. In one case, when the delay is above a certain lower limit and a counter is equal to or above '04', `MCB_UILDQSDEC` and `MCB_UIUDQSDEC` are set to '1', and `DQS_DELAY` is decreased. The block overall manages delay within a system in correlation with other state change processes.\n"
