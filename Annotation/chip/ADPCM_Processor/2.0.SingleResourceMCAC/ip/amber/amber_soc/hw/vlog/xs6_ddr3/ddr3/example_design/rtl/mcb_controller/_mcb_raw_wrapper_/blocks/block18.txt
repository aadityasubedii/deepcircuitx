Comment: 
This block of code generates C_NUM_DQ_PINS number of OSERDES2 components to serialize the data before sending it out. For each iteration the code generates an OSERDES2 instance with certain predefined specifications such as bypassing the global clock flip flop, setting up certain data rates, choosing output and SERDES mode, and assigning specific data width and training pattern. For each OSERDES2 instance, the output (OQ), true output (TQ), clock signals(CLK0, CLK1, CLKDIV) along with reset (RST), data input (D1, D2, D3, D4), shift inputs(SHIFTIN1, SHIFTIN2, SHIFTIN3, SHIFTIN4), true data inputs(T1, T2, T3, T4), clock enable signals(CE, TCE) and a training signal(TRAIN) are correctly wired and recon[figured.
