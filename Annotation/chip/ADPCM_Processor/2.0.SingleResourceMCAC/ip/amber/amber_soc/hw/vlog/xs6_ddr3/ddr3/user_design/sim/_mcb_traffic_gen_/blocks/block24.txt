Comment: 
This block is responsible for updating the write data counts in a synchronous manner. It resets the count when a reset signal (`dcount_rst`) is high, or incrementally updates the count when the write enable (`mcb_wr_en`) signal is high. The increment size depends on the data width (`DWIDTH`), where the count increments by `DWIDTH/8` units. The update process is triggered on each positive edge of the clock signal (`clk_i`).
