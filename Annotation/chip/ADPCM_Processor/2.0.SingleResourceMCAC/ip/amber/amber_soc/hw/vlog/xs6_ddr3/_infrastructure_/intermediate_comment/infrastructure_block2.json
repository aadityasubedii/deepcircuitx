    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronous logic design that generates a reset signal with clean clock-domain crossing. It is implemented with a reset synchronization technique using a shift register. The 'always' block triggers at every rising edge of the qualified clock signal or the reset signal. If the reset signal is asserted, it overrides the shift register with all '1's, thus maintaining the reset. Else, the register content is continuously shifted to the left, essentially de-asserting the reset signal progressively across the circuit."
