    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to handle memory write operations, specifically to encode write enable signals and data. On each clock event, if there's no full command detected, a write request is made based on the combination of `write_request` or `write_buf_r`. Depending on the lower two bits of `wb_adr`, different write mask patterns are generated using bit manipulations to control which parts of the memory need to be written. The coded data is then filled into `o_wr_data` by repeating the `wb_dat` value four times."
