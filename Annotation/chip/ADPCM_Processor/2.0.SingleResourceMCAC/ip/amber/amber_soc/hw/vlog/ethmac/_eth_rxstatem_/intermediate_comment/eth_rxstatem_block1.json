    "block_comment": "This block simply assigns the concatenation of the values `StateData1` and `StateData0` to the two least significant bits of `StateData`. It's implemented using the assign keyword for continuous assignment and the concatenation operator `{}` to combine `StateData1` and `StateData0` together into a 2-bit binary number."
