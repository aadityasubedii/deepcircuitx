    "block_comment": "The block works as a combination of a shift register and expander. It takes in an 8-bit data and outputs a 9-bit data. The main functionality includes shifting the input bit-string by one position towards right while adding an additional bit in each iteration. However, this additional bit is not just appended plainly, it follows an interesting logic - if the considered two bits are '10', then it appends '11', otherwise it takes one bit from the input data and one bit from the already shifted data. This task is implemented using if-else conditions within recursive blocks."
