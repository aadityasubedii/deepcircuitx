    "block_comment": "The block is a state machine handling type length checking in a receiver module. At each positive edge of the receiver clock or reset signal, transitions are determined by conditional statements. When reset, 'TypeLengthOK' is set to 0. During the detection window, if 'ByteCntEq12', it checks if the most significant byte of received data matches with 'TypeLength', and if 'ByteCntEq13', it checks if the least significant byte of 'RxData' matches 'TypeLength' and previous 'TypeLengthOK' state. When 'ReceiveEnd' is detected, 'TypeLengthOK' is reset."
