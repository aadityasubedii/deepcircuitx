Comment: 
This block of code is a serial data shift register for receiving UART data. On every rising edge of the input clock signal 'i_clk', it takes the incoming serial data line 'i_uart_rxd' and appends to the least significant bit of the 5-bit register 'rxd_d', while the remaining bits are filled by shifting the existing ones towards the most significant bit.
