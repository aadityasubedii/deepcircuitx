    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing a register update, specifically the run_traffic_reg register. This update operation happens at the positive edge of the clock signal, following a delay equal to TCQ. The new value for the run_traffic_reg comes from the input run_traffic_i. This means the functionality of this block mainly deals with synchronous register update alongside the clk_i signal, ensuring delay-bound, correct timing for data transitions."
