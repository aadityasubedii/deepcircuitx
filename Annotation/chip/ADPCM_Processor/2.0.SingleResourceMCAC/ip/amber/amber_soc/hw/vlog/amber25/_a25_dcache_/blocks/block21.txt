This block of code defines read data paths for a cache memory structure. The cache is configurable to have either 2, 3, 4, or 8 ways. Depending on the way configuration, the block assigns `hit_rdata`, read data from the hit line, from the corresponding data way if there is a cache hit in that way. If none of the ways causes a cache hit, the assigned value is a vector with all bits set to 1.
