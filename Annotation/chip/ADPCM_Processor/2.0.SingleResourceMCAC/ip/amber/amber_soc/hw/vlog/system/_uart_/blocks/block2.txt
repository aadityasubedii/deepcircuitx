This block defines the state machine of a receiver (RXD) in data communication. It specifically assigns human-readable state names to the numerical state values of the receiver state machine. Implemented as a series of ternary (conditional) operators, it checks the current state of the `rxd_state` variable and maps it to the corresponding string description. If the `rxd_state` is not found in the given map, it defaults to "UNKNOWN".
