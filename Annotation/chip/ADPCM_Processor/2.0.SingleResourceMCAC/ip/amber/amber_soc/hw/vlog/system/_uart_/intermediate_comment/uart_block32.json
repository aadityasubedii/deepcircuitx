    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for generating the o_wb_ack signal. It specifically assigns the o_wb_ack signal to be true when the i_wb_stb is active (high) and either wb_start_write or wb_start_read_d1 is active (high). This effectively makes the o_wb_ack signal an acknowledgment for write or read requests."
