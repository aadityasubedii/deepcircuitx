    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code block represents the instantiation of a \"BUFGCE\" (Buffer with Clock Enable) module for clock management, denoted as \"U_BUFG_CLK1\". The BUFGCE is used to distribute clock signals across the entire FPGA with a minimal skew. Essentially, this block provides clock signal buffering and gating. It inputs a clock signal (mcb_drp_clk_bufg_in), checks for a 'locked' clock-enable signal, and if the lock is authenticated, propagates the buffered clock signal (mcb_drp_clk) to the next stage of the design."
