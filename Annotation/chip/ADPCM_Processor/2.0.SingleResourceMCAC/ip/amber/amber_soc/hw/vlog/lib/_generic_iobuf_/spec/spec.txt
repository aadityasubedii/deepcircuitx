Module name: generic_iobuf. 

Module specification: The generic_iobuf module represents a typical input-output buffer (IOBUF) with bidirectional signals. The core functionality of this module is to allow signals to go in or out, facilitating communications between the internal logic of a device and its external interface pins. It contains two input ports, 'I' and 'T', where 'I' is the input signal to the module and 'T' acts as a control signal to determine the behavior of the bidirectional 'IO' pin. One output port, 'O', is present in the module, reflecting the current state of the 'IO' pin. There's also an 'IO' port, functioning as both an input and an output pin based on the status of 'T'. If 'T' is high (1), 'IO' is in the high impedance state (Z) and if 'T' is low (0), 'IO' mirrors the value of 'I'. Internally, the module does not define or use any other signals apart from the designated input/output ports. The Verilog code consists of digital assignments interconnecting 'I', 'T', 'O', and 'IO' to implement the desired IOBUF behavior.
