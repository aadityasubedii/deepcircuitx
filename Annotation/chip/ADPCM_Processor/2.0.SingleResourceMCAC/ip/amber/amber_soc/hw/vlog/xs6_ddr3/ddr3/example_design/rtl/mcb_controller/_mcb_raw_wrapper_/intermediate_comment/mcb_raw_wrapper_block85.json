    "block_comment": "This block manages address mapping for memory commands in a multi-port memory interface. The block's function is to generate row address (ra), bank address (ba), and column address (ca) signals for up to six memory ports (p0 to p5) based on the input byte addresses. The implementation details vary depending on the memory configuration parameters such as the number of DQ pins (C_NUM_DQ_PINS), memory address order (C_MEM_ADDR_ORDER), and port configuration (C_PORT_CONFIG). The block uses conditional assignments to handle different bit widths for address, bank, and column fields, accommodating various memory sizes and organizations. It also includes zero-padding for cases where the configured width is less than the maximum supported width."
