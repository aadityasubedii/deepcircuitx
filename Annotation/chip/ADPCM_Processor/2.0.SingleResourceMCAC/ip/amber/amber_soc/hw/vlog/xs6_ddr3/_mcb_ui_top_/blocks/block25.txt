The block is a set of connection instructions for an FPGA's memory controller. If C_S0_AXI_ENABLE signal is absent, all output signals of the memory controller top-level module are assigned to corresponding input signals, effectively just routing signals without any processing. If C_S0_AXI_ENABLE signal is active, it instantiates an AXI interface for the memory controller. The module 'axi_mcb' is configured with various parameters and connects to the AXI protocol signals. Furthermore, it also instantiates a synchronizer module to handle the calibration signal. This allows the memory controller block to interact with other AXI-based modules.
