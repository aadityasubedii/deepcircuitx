    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to conditionally generate a specific data pattern. If the data width (DWIDTH) is set to 64 and the data pattern (DATA_PATTERN) is either \"DGEN_WALKING0\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", or \"DGEN_ALL\", a unique pattern named \"WALKING_ONE_64_PATTERN\" will be generated. The implementation features the use of a conditional (if) statement within a generate structure, providing greater flexibility in pattern generation based on the defined conditions."
