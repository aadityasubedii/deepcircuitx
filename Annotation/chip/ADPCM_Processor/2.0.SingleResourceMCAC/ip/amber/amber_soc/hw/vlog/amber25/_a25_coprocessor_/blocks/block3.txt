Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for sample management at positive clock edge without stalling the core. It works as follows: whenever there is a positive (rising) edge in the input clock `i_clk` and there is no core stall (`i_core_stall` is low), it will sample the current `i_copro_operation` and feed it into `copro_operation_d1`, and similarly, it performs the same action for `i_copro_crn` and `copro_crn_d1`. This process is synchronous with the rising edge of the clock and highly timing-precise.
