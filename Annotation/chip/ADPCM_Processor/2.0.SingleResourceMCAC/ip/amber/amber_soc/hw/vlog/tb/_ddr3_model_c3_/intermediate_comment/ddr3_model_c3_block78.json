    "block_comment": "The block of code initiates a timing check on a specific bit, bit 52, of the input data (dq_in[]) anytime there's a change in its state. This operation is achieved by calling the 'dq_timing_check' function with bit 52 of dq_in[] as the argument inside an 'always' block, causing the function to run each time that bit value changes."
