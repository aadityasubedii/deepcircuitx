The block of code assigns a constant low (0) value to the output wire `o_wb_err`. This is done using the `assign` keyword in Verilog, typically used to define combinational logic wherein the output is continuously driven by the assigned value or expression. In this case, `o_wb_err` is always driven by the value '0', indicating that it is used to signal a lack of error in the (wishbone) WB interface's operation.
