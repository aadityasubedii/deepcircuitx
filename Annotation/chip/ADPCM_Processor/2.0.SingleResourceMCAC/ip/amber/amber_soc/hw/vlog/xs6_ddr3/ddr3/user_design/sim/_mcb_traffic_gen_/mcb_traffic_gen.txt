Module-level comment: 
/* This module generates memory read/write traffic for MCB testing.
   It uses parameterized design for flexibility across different FPGA devices.
   The module generates commands and data patterns based on input modes and seeds,
   manages data flow through FIFOs, implements error checking, and provides
   status outputs. It includes separate paths for read and write operations,
   with configurable burst lengths and address modes. */
