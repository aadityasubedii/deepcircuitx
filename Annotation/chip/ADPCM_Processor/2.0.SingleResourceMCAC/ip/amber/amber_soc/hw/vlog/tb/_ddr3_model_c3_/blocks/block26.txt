The function of this block is to trigger a timing check during the falling edge of the dqs_in signal at index 6. This timing check is done by invoking the dqs_neg_timing_check function with 6 as an argument whenever a negedge (negative or falling edge) is detected on the dqs_in signal at the 6th bit position.
