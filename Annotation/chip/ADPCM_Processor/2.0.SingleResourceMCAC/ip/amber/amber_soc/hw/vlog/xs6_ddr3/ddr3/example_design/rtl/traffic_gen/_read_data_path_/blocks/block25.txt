Comment: 
This block of code handles data reading in Verilog. Specifically, it assigns the value of the internal read data signal (rd_mdata) to the output read data signal (rd_mdata_o). The `assign` keyword is used here to create a continuous assignment statement, so whenever rd_mdata changes, it will immediately propagate to rd_mdata_o. This mechanism creates a mirror or pass-through connection for read data from the internal system to the output for further processes or interfaces.
