    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a rising edge DQS receiver for DDR SDRAM memory interface. The event is triggered by the positive edge of dqs_odd[15] signal. The always @ keyword marks the block as sensitive to the specified event, and when that event occurs, it executes the dqs_odd_receiver(15) function to handle the received data. For implementation details, it employs a simple synchronous design pattern typical in Verilog RTL codes."
