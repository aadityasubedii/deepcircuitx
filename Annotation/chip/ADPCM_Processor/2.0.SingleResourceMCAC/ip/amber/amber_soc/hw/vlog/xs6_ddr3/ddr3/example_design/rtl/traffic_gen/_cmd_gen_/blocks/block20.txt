This block of Verilog RTL code manages the counts of memory address and the status of its initialization on a system with a reset and clock cycle control. During a positive edge of the clock signal, the block checks for a reset signal, setting the counter to a starting address and disabling completion flag, else it checks if certain conditions regarding address boundaries are met like `cmd_clk_en_r` or `mode_load_pulse_r1` signals and if `addr_counts_next_r` is greater or equals to `end_addr_i`, it resets the counter to start. If `addr_counts` is less than `end_addr_r`, it increments the counter. After reaching end address, it marks `mem_init_done` as high signifying memory initialization completion.
