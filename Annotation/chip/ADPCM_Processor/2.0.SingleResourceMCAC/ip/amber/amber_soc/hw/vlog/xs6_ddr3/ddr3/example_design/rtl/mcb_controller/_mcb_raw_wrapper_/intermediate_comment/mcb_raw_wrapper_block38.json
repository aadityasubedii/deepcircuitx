    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code initiates a simulation process. It starts by setting 'wait_200us_counter' to the hexadecimal value 'FFFF', essentially resetting the counter. Additionally, it prints a message to the console specifying that a 200 microsecond wait time, typically necessary before the Clock Enable (CKE) goes active, is being ignored for the simulation. This is most likely done to expedite the simulation process by skipping this delay."
