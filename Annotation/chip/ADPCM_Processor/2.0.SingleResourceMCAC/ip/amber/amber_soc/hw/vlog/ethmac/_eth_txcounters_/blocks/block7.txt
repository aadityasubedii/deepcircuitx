Comment: 
The block checks for an exceeding defer count and assigns it to the variables `ExcessiveDeferCnt` and `ExcessiveDefer`. It does this by comparing the 14-bit subset of `NibCnt` with hexadecimal number '17b7', and assigns the logical equality of `(NibCnt[13:0] == 16'h17b7)` to `ExcessiveDeferCnt`. The block then assigns the logical 'AND' of `(NibCnt[13:0] == 16'h17b7)` and the bit-wise negation of `ExDfrEn` to `ExcessiveDefer`.
