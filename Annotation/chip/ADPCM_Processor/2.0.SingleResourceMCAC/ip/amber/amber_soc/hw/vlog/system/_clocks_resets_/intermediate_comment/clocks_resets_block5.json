    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for clock period calculation. Initially, at the positive edge of 'i_brd_clk_p', the current simulation time is assigned to the 'brd_temp' variable. Then, at the next positive edge of 'i_brd_clk_p', the period is calculated by subtracting 'brd_temp' from the current time, giving the 'brd_clk_period'. The 'pll_clk_period' is then calculated as one fourth of the 'brd_clk_period'."
