    "block_comment": "This block functions as a multiplexer for choosing which of the 16 r_out signals to output. The relationship between the selection signal, i_rds_sel, and the selected output signal, o_rs, is determined by a combinational logic and switch-statement style case block. The case block associates each value of the 4-bit i_rds_sel signal (ranging from 0 to 14) to a corresponding r_out signal (r0_out to r14_rds), and defaults to r15_out_rn for any other i_rds_sel value."
