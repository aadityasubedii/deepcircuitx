This block of code performs an initialization sequence for a given set of mode registers in a Verilog simulation environment. It primarily uses the `cmd_task` procedure inside a conditional DEBUG statement to display a timestamped output message and issue a series of commands to set up the mode registers. Firstly, a 'NO OPERATION' command is sent to prep the system. Then, a ZQ command with an immediate operand of '0x400' performs an impedance calibration. This is followed by an upload of the values of the mode registers, starting from 'mode_reg3' and ending with 'mode_reg0' OR'ed with '0x100'. Finally, another 'NO OPERATION' command is issued to finalize the setup. The purpose of the initialization task is to prepare the system for future operations.
