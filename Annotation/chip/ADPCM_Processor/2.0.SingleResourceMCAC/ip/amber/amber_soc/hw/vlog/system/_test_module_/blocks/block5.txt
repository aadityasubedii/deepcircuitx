Comment: 
This block of code manages a counter, specifically tracking clock cycles. It functions through a register (cycles_reg) that increments itself by one (1'd1) every time there is a positive edge in the clock signal (i_clk). This implementation is typical in systems where monitoring the number of elapsed clock cycles is necessary, such as for performance evaluation or timing control.
