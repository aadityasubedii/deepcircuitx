This block represents a task in Verilog RTL that displays the status of registers related to an Amber Core. The task employs the `$display` function to print the status of various aspects of the system. It commences by displaying a border string for clarity. Then it exhibits the current status mode ("< User, FIRQ, IRQ, SVC") based on `U_EXECUTE.status_bits_mode` using a case construct. Afterwards, it presents the values of the register bank variables `r0` to `r14` in hexadecimal format for straightforward checking. The unique part is that from `r8` to `r14`, it also displays the different mode values (like `r8_firq`, `r13_svc`, etc.). The program displays the program counter 'PC' (`r15`) and states the status bits, including the mode name. Finally, it concludes with a border string.
