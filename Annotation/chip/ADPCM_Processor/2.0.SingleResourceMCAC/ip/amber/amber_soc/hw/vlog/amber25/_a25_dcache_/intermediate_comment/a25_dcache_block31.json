    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for enabling a write operation to a specified way in a cache memory. It achieves this by performing a logical AND operation between the 'tag_wenable' signal and the result of a logical OR operation involving 'select_way' at index 'i' and the known constant 'source_sel[C_INIT]'. Thus, a write operation is enabled if 'tag_wenable' signal is asserted and either the way 'i' is selected or the initialization value of 'source_sel' is true."
