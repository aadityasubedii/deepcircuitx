The top-level module receives signals from various inputs and passes them to the 'mcb_soft_calibration' module to update memory controller statuses and transmit corresponding output values. \n\nThere are also flip-flops for signal processing, IO buffers, and input/output delay reduction circuits to ensure correct timing parameters.
