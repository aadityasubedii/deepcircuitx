    "block_comment": "This block of code acts as a sensitivity list for the dq_timing_check function, activating it whenever there's a change on the 26th index of the dq_in input signal. Within the RTL Verilog code, an always block monitors the dq_in[26] bit and triggers the dq_timing_check function with the argument '26' whenever this specific bit changes its value."
