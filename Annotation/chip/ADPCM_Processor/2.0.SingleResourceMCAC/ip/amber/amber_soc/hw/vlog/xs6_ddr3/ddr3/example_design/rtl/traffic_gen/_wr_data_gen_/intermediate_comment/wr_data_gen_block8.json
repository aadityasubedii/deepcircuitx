    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to set the `cmd_rdyC` signal based on the provided conditions. The signal `cmd_rdyC` becomes ready on the rising edges of the clock (`clk_i`) when either a reset (`rst_i[0]`) has been triggered, a command start (`cmd_startC`) has been initiated (assuming `bl_i` is equal to 1), or when the user burst count (`user_burst_cnt`) is equal to 2 and the FIFO is not full (`fifo_not_full`). It employs edge-triggered logic, relying on the signal states at each clock edge to drive the `cmd_rdyC` signal."
