This block handles the synchronous updates to the hdata variable using the clock signal. If the reset signal is high, the hdata bitstring is cleared. Otherwise, if the FIFO is ready and either the burst count isn't zero or the command start is high, the hdata bitstring is filled with a specific pattern that depends on the NUM_DQ_PINS parameter. If it is 16, every 16th bit is filled with '1'; if 8, every 8th bit is filled with '1'; and if 4, every 4th bit is filled with '1'.
