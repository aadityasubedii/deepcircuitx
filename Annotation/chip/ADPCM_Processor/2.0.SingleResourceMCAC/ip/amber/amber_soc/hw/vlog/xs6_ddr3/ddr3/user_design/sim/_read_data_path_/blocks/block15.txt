This code block is responsible for comparing reading data with expected data and signaling an error if they don't match. On every positive edge of the input clock, it checks whether comparison is enabled (`cmp_data_en`). If it is, the block compares the lower (`l_data_error`) and upper (`u_data_error`) halves of the read data (`rd_data_r`) with the corresponding halves of the comparison data (`cmp_data_r`). If there's a mismatch, an error flag is raised. If the comparison is not enabled, it defaults the error flags to 0. The overall `data_error` is an OR between the lower and upper data errors. If an error is detected, it displays an error message with the expected and received data at that time instance. The `#TCQ` conveys that there's a delay but the exact duration is defined elsewhere in the code.
