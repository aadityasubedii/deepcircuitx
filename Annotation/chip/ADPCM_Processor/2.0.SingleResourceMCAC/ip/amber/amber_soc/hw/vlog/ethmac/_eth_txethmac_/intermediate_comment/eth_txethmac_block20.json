    "block_comment": "This block implements a stop excessive deferral mechanism in a media access controller. Upon the leading edge of MTxClk or Reset, if a reset condition is detected, it clears the StopExcessiveDeferOccured flag. If there's no reset condition but a transmission start frame (TxStartFrm) is detected, the flag is cleared. However, if an excessive deferral occured during transmission, the flag is set. This process leverages event-driven procedural assignments for flag control."
