Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) in a Xilinx FPGA design, supporting up to 6 ports configurable as native MCB or AXI interfaces. It manages clock distribution, arbitration between ports, and interfaces with external memory. The module has numerous input and output ports, including clock signals (sysclk_2x, pll_ce_0), reset (sys_rst), command and data signals for up to 6 ports (p0_cmd_clk to p5_rd_error), memory interface signals (mcbx_dram_addr, mcbx_dram_ba), and AXI interface signals for up to 6 slave interfaces (s0_axi_aclk to s5_axi_rready). Internal signals include buffered versions of
