Comment: 
This block of code handles the generation of a write command (`force_wrcmd_gen`) in a memory controller under different conditions. On each positive edge of the clock (`clk_i`), the block checks if the reset signal (`rst_i[0]`) is high, in which case it sets `force_wrcmd_gen` to 0. It then checks conditions: when the end of a burst length is not being waited on or when the force write command timeout counter (`force_wrcmd_timeout_cnts`) reaches its maximum value, `force_wrcmd_gen` is again set to 0. Finally, if a valid command is received with a burst length greater than 16, or it is presently waiting on the end of a burst length event, it sets `force_wrcmd_gen` to 1. The `#TCQ` represents a delay element with a timing period equal to TCQ.
