The block of code assigns a default '0' value to the wire 'o_wb_err'. This is achieved by using the 'assign' Verilog keyword which specifies a continuous assignment. The 1'd0 notation implies that the value is a 1-bit value of 0. As such, this line indicates that the o_wb_err wire is by default, set to 0.
