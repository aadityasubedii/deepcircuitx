    "block_comment": "This block is configuring a RAMB16BWER block, a specific type of RAM (Random Access Memory) block in Verilog. The parameters control the behaviour and structure of the RAM block. Data width of both address lines A and B are set to 36 bits. It sets the register option for the output of the RAM blocks to zero, meaning the data output is not registered. The block also sets options for reset and initialization of the RAM blocks, where EN_RSTRAM_A and EN_RSTRAM_B are set to \"FALSE\" indicating that the RAM outputs won't reset during global resets. SRVAL_A is set to 0, which is the value output by RAMA after a synchronous reset. The INITPx parameters are used to preset the initial contents of memory, all set to 0 in this case. Similarly, the INIT_xx parameters are used to load initial data into the memory cells, each representing an initial value for a separate memory cell."
