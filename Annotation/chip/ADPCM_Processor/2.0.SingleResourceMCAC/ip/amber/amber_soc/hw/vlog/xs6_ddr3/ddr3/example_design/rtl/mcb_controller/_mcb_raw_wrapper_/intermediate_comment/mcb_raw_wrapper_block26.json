    "block_comment": "This block generates the Output Off-Chip Driver (ODT) for DDR2 and DDR3 memory types, conditionally instanced based on the defined memory type. It utilizes the OSERDES2 FPGA primitive to serialize data inputs [D1, D2] using the clock (ioclk0) and control signals. The serial data output, OQ, is sent to the 'ioi_odt' line. The module also uses the 'int_sys_rst' as a reset signal. Data input parameters like data rate, output mode, and width are designed to be easily configurable through the use of defined constants at the beginning of the instantiation."
