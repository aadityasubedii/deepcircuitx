    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a hardware sensitive always block that reacts to changes in the sixth element of the `dq_in` input array. It accomplishes this by invoking the `dq_timing_check` function with the index '6' as an argument whenever a change on `dq_in[6]` is detected, subsequently executing any logic defined in the `dq_timing_check` function."
