    "block_comment": "This Verilog code is a typical synchronous design block, responsible for managing multiple signal enable flags like WriteBack (WbEn), Transmit (TxEn), and Receive (RxEn). The changes in these signals are synced with the leading edge of the 'WB_CLK_I' signal. These signals are reset to '0' upon a reset signal, and otherwise, they are updated from the corresponding non-register variables."
