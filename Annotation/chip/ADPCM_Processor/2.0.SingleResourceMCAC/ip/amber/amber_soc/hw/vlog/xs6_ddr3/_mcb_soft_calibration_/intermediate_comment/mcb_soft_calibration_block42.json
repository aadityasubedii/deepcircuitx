    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially configuring an I/O Double Data Rate (DDR) memory controller. The code first assigns signal values for different control signals for the I/O DDR memory controller. The 'Active_IODRP' is assigned the signal from 'ZIO' and 'IODRPCTRLR_CMD_VALID' is set HIGH indicating a valid command for the controller. 'IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR' and 'IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA' are assigned address and data for the memory cell. The 'IODRPCTRLR_R_WB' is set to WRITE_MODE, implying that a write operation is intended. Following these assignments, the block checks the status of the I/O DDR memory controller in 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N'. If controller is ready, it transitions the system state to 'LOAD_ZIO_PTERM', otherwise it transitions to 'WAIT3'."
