    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'ethmac_wb' module serves as an interface manager between master-slave Wishbone bus systems, ensuring proper data flow. It's parameterized by data width and select-line width. There are two main blocks, catering to either a 32-bit or 128-bit bus system, controlled by the WB_DWIDTH input. It receives inputs for read, write, address, and control operations and conditionally assigns output signals. The module carries out endian-based operations for data handling, but does not create extra internal signals. The operation is conducted via direct assignments based on conditions within generate-if-else blocks."
