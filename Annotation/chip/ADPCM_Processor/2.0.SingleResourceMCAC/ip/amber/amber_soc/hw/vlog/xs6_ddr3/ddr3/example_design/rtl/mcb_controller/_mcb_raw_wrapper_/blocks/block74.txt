Comment: 
This block of code identifies and reports invalid commands for a read-only port. It achieves this by continuously monitoring the status of `C_PORT_CONFIG`, `p5_cmd_en`, and `p5_cmd_instr` signals. Whenever `C_PORT_CONFIG` is set to "R32", `p5_cmd_en` is enabled, and both the third and first bits of `p5_cmd_instr` are '0', a conditional test passes, and the system throws an error message indicating an invalid command for read-only port 5, after which the simulation ends.
