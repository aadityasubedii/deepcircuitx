    "block_comment": "This block is designed for conditionally generating logic based on the specified FPGA family. In particular, it checks if the design is intended for the VIRTEX6 family of FPGA devices. If so, a logic block labeled INC_COUNTS_V will be begun. This conditional compilation style allows designers to tailor their code to the specific features and configurations of targeted FPGA hardware, enabling performance optimizations and resource efficiencies."
