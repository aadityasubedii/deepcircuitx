The block controls a synchronized reset process for a Receiver IRQ in a digital system. Initiated at either a positive edge of the Receiver Clock (RxClk) or a positive edge of the Reset, it uses a two-stage synchronization mechanism for ResetRxCIrq_sync2. If the Reset is high, the synchronous reset forces the ResetRxCIrq_sync2 signal to a binary '0'. Otherwise, the ResetRxCIrq_sync2 signal obtained value from ResetRxCIrq_sync1 with a time delay specified by Tp. This structure helps prevent metastability that could occur with asynchronous signals.
