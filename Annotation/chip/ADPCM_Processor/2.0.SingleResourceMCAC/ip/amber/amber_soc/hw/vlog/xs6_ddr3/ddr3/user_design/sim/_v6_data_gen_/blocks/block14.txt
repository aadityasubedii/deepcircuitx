Comment: 
This block is primarily designed for data generation with different modes, subjected to various selection conditions. Upon the positive edge of the input clock, and when either the input fifo flag is ready or the start command is detected, the block generates data based on the selected data mode and address input. It uses a case decision-tree to determine the output data (`w1data`), primarily based on the bits 6 to 11 of the input address (`addr_i`). The selection of data generation function, `Data_Gen` or `Data_GenW0`, depends on the `data_mode_i`. If it is '0101', `Data_Gen` is chosen; otherwise, `Data_GenW0` is chosen. If the burst length of the memory is 8, a reassignment of `w1data` incorporating shifting and concatenation operations takes place. If no matching conditions are found, `w1data` is reset to zero.
