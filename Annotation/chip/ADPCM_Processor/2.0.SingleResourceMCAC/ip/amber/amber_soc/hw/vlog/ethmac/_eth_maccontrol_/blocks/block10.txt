The block assigns a value to `TxDoneOut`, which indicates the completion of a transmission operation. Depending on the state of `CtrlMux`, the implementation utilizes ternary logic operation to make a choice between two different scenarios, both aggressively checking that transmission has not freshly started (`~TxStartFrmIn`) and no block transmission is done (`~BlockTxDone`). If `CtrlMux` is high, `MuxedDone` is considered, otherwise `TxDoneIn` is checked. This demonstrates adaptivity based on control context.
