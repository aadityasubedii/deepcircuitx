    "block_comment": "The Verilog block of code is being utilized as a conditional block generator to create specific logic based on the input parameters 'NUM_DQ_PINS' and 'DATA_PATTERN'. If the number of DQ pins is 8 and the pattern of data matches any of the mentioned (\"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", \"DGEN_ALL\"), a specific logic associated with the tag 'WALKING_ONE_8_PATTERN' will be generated. This design will create the necessary DQ pattern which can be further used for data handling or data manipulation based on the selection of pins and data pattern."
