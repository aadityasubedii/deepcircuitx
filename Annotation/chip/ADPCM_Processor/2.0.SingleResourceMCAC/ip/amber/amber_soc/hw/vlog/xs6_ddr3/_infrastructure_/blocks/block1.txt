Comment: 
This line is generating a reset signal for the module. Specifically, it pulls out the final element (or 'most significant bit') from `rst0_sync_r`, a presumably larger synchronization list/array, and assigns it to `rst0`. This is typically done to ensure reset signal stability, as resets can often be transitioning continuously. In this case, by using the last element of `rst0_sync_r`, it allows for a fixed stage of synchronizing the reset signal to the local clock domain.
