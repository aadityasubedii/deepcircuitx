    "block_comment": "This block declares two wire arrays, dq_oq and dq_tq, used for Data-Quantum output and toggle operations respectively. The arrays are both defined from C_NUM_DQ_PINS-1 (a predefined constant indicating the total number of Data-Quantum pins) down to 0, meaning each array will have elements indexed from 0 to (C_NUM_DQ_PINS-1), inclusive."
