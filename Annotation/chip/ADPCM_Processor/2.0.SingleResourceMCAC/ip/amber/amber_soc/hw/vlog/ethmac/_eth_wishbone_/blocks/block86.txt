This block of code is responsible for managing the state of the 'LastWord' signal within a larger system, potentially a data transmission system. The state of 'LastWord' resets to 0 on a rising edge of the 'Reset' signal. Meanwhile, if 'TxEndFrm', 'TxAbort', 'TxRetry' signals are true concurrently with 'Flop', or if 'TxUsedData' & 'Flop' are true when 'TxByteCnt' equals 3, 'LastWord' also resets to 0. But in the last case, if 'TxEndFrm_wb' is true, then 'LastWord' takes the value of 'TxEndFrm_wb'. This functionality is achieved with the use of a sequential always block, edge detector events, and conditional if statements.
