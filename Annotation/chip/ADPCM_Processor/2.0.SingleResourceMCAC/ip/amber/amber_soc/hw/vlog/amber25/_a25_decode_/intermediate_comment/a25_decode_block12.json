    "block_comment": "The line of code is assigning a new value to the signal `firq_not_user_mode_nxt` based on a conditional statement. The check is to determine whether the value of `status_bits_mode_nxt` equals to `FIRQ`. If the condition is true, `firq_not_user_mode_nxt` becomes true (or 1 in binary terms). This line of code is commonly used in interrupt handling where FIRQ stands for Fast Interrupt Request, and it helps the processor know if a fast interrupt request is in progress."
