This block of code handles the latching operation for transmit valid bytes, synchronized with the write-back clock or a system reset event. The first initial block at reset sets the latch 'TxValidBytesLatched' to zero. The next block handles the scenario where new valid bytes are received but aren't latched. In this case, 'TxValidBytesLatched' is set to 'TxValidBytes'. The last section resets 'TxValidBytesLatched' when a retry, done, or abort pulse is observed indicating the end of operation or an error condition.
