    "block_comment": "This block of code simply tackles clock jobbing in a DDR interface. It checks for the positive edge of the Data Strobe (dqs_in[12]) signal and then calls the function `dqs_pos_timing_check` with the constant `12` as the input argument. The function here is possibly used for the timing check, adjusting the data capture based on the timing of the DQS signal."
