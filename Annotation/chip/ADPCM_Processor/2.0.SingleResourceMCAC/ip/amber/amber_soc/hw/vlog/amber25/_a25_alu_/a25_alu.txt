Module-level comment: The 'a25_alu' module is an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performing arithmetic and bitwise operations on 32-bit input operands based on a 9-bit function code. Swapping and NOT operation on inputs, deciding carry in/out, and performing arithmetic using dedicated FPGA hardware define the initial operations. It further achieves its output by performing bitwise operations, sign/zero extension, and selecting output based on function code. Status flags for each result are also generated.
