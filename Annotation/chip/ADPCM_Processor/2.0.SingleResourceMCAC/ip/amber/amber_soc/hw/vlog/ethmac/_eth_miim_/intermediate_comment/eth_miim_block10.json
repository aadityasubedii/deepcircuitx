    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a signal `StartOp` that gets activated upon the execution of three operations: `WriteDataOp`, `ReadStatusOp`, or `ScanStatusOp`. The keyword `assign` is used to establish that `StartOp` will take on the logical OR value of the three operations. When any one of these operations is executed or is in progress (in other words, when its value is 'high' or 1), `StartOp` is set to be active/high; otherwise, it remains low. This operation is implemented using the bitwise OR operator (`|`), which combines the status of the three operations to set the `StartOp` signal. This setup enables a check for the execution of either the write data, read status, or scan status operation in a single variable."
