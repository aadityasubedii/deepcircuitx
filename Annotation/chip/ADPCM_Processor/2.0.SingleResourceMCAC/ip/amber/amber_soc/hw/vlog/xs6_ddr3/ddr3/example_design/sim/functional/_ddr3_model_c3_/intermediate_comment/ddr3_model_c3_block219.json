    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a memory read operation in a Verilog system. Depending on the predefined parameter `MAX_MEM`, it packages the bank, row, and column inputs into a unified address (divided by `BL_MAX` for block management) and retrieves or reads the respective data from memory. If `MAX_MEM` is defined, it ignores bank addressing and only uses row and column for address generation. If `MAX_MEM` is not defined, it uses bank addressing along with row and column. If the address is found in memory, the data at the address is output. Otherwise, it outputs an undefined (`1'bx`) block of data."
