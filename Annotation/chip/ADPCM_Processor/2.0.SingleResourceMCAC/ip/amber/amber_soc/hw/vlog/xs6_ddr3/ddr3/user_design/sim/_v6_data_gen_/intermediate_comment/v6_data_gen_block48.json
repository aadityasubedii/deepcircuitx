    "block_comment": "This block of code is an conditional logic generation block that operates under specific parameters. If the total number of Data Query (DQ) pins is equal to 40 and the Data Pattern matches any of \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\", this module gets activated. The logic associated with this block is triggered on the positive edge of an input clock signal, denoted as 'clk_i', promoting a synchronous design."
