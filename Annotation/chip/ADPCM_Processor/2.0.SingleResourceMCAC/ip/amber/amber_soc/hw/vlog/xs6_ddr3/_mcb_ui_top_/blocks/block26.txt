The function of this block is to instantiate the mcb_raw_wrapper module, which acts as an interface between the system and the memory controller block (MCB). The interface controls the read and write operations over the memory using input signals like sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, p0_cmd_en, p0_cmd_instr, and more, also provides output signals like status, p0_cmd_empty, p1_cmd_empty, etc. It handles read and write requests, timing control signals (clock and reset), data signals and address for multiple ports (p0-p5). These ports allow simultaneous data access and provide complete control over operations such as writing data with applicable masks, reading data, controlling error scenarios for each port. It also manages communication and memory operations for DDR memory with signals like mcbx_dram_addr, mcbx_dram_clk etc.
