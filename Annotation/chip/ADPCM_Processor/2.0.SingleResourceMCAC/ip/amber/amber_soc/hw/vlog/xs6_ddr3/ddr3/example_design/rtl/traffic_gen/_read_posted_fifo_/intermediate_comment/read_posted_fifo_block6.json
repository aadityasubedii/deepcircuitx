    "block_comment": "This block of code maintains a count of valid data received. Using a rising-edge triggered always block, it listens for a high reset (rst_i) or valid data signal (data_valid_i). When reset is high, the count (rd_data_received_counts) is reset to zero. Otherwise, if the data_valid_i signal is high, the count is incremented."
