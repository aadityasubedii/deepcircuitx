This block generates a two-stage synchronizer for the Busy_IRQ signal. The synchronizer is clocked by the MRxClk signal. This is done by sequentially passing the Busy_IRQ_sync2 signal through two flip-flops, Busy_IRQ_syncb1 and Busy_IRQ_syncb2, thus reducing the chance of metastability in the signal passed to the following logic stage. The propagation delay, denoted by '#Tp', is applied during each flip-flop stage.
