This block primarily provides functionality to control memory type DDR3 using an output serializer (OSERDES2). When C_MEM_TYPE is selected as DDR3, OSERDES2's parameters (e.g., data rate, output mode, etc.) are configured with predefined constants, with a data width set as 2. The core functionality includes taking 'rst_90' as input data (D1, D2) and clock 'ioclk0'; shifting output 'ioi_rst', I/O Clock Enable 'pll_ce_0' and Output Clock Enable 'pll_lock'; and handling system reset with 'int_sys_rst'. Other inputs like CLK1, CLKDIV and SHIFTINx are tied to 0 while TCE is tied to 1, likely implying fixed mode functionality.
