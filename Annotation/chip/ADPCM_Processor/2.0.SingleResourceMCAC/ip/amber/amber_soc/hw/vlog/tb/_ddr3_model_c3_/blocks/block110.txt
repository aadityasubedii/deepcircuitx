Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is an invocation of `dq_timing_check` function whenever there is a change in the 21st bit (`[20]`) of `dq_in`. The always block is an important procedural block in Verilog that behaves much like a software program, because it provides designers with a powerful way to model any kind of digital behavior. In this case, it continuously monitors the signal `dq_in[20]` and invokes the `dq_timing_check(20)` function whenever changes in the signal are detected.
