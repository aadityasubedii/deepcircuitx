    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is the P5 User Interface section of an AXI controller interface. It performs operations related to assigning address registers and interconnecting AXI and the MCB module. The inputs `s5_axi_araddr` & `s5_axi_awaddr` are masked with `P_S5_AXI_ADDRMASK` to generate the internal signals. A synchronization module `mcb_ui_top_synch` is instantiated for synchronizing calibration operation, with `uo_done_cal` as its input. Then, an AXI MCB (Memory Controller Block) module `axi_mcb` is instantiated for managing data operations including data read, write & address processing with various AXI and MCB interface signals as inputs. Within this wide range of signals, each contributes towards successful AXI MCB operations, like address, data, synchronization, and control information handling."
