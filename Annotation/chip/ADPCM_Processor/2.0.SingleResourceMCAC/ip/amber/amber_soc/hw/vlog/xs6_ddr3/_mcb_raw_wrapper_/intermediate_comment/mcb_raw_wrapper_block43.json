    "block_comment": "This block of code represents the instantiation of a Memory Controller Block (MCB) in Verilog that communicates with external memory chips using parameters for different types of DDR memory (DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and Mobile DDR) and various operational timings for different memory access operations. The MCB operates with a variable number of command ports for managing memory accesses generated by different logic modules, therefore it supports arbitration between them. Numerous parameters are used to configure the memory's properties, including the type, width, burst length, addressing order etc. The MCB also accepts signals to control the calibration process and to monitor its status. Moreover, the MCB handles refreshing of memory cells periodically by controlling the self-refresh mode of the DDR memory, the entry and exit to which are indicated by the SELFREFRESHMODE and SELFREFRESHENTER signals. Lastly, signals ending with 'CLK' denote the separate clocks associated with different ports."
