This block generates PRBS (Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence) addresses used in command patterns. When the command pattern is either "CGEN_PRBS" or "CGEN_ALL", the 'cmd_prbs_gen' module is instantiated. It uses parameters like timing control, family, address and data widths, seed width, and mask positions. The inputs to this module include the clock and enable signals, the PRBS seed initialization control signal, and the seed input. The module output is the generated PRBS address.
