    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to create a pipeline of register elements that implement a delay mechanism for the \"cmp_data\" signal, running on a rising edge clock \"clk_i\". Once the rising edge of the clock signal triggers, the data contained in \"cmp_data\" is passed along this chain of registers, each representing a delay stage whose delay value is represented by \"#TCQ\". Thus, the \"cmp_data\" signal gets delayed consecutively and its value is stored in \"cmp_data_r\", \"cmp_data_r2\", \"cmp_data_r3\", and \"cmp_data_r4\" respectively."
