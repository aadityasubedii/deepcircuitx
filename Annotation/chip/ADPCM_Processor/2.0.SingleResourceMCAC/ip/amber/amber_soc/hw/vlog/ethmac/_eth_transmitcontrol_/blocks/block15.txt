This block of Verilog code manages the control signal (CtrlMux) for a transmit operation. It responds to either a positive edge clock pulse (MTxClk) or transmission reset (TxReset) event. When a TxReset event occurs, CtrlMux is immediately set to 0, effectively resetting the ongoing transmission. However, if a control frame needs to be sent and the TxUsedDataOut is not set, CtrlMux is set to 1, meaning a control message will be transmitted. Lastly, if transmission is done (TxDoneIn is true), CtrlMux is reinitialized to 0, indicating the end of transmission. The propagation delay (Tp) is considered for all signal assignments in this block.
