    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a debugging aid, operating under a specific condition during a positive clock edge. The code checks if the sum of the \"data_hit_way\" arrays (presumably indicating a data hit in various cache ways) is larger than 1. If this condition is met, it triggers an error message saying \"Hit in more than one cache ways!\" which then gets displayed. This would point to an unusual, potentially erroneous, situation of finding the same data in more than one cache ways."
