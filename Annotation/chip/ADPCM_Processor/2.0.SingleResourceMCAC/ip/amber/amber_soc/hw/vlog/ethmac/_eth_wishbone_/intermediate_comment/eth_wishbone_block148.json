    "block_comment": "This block of code is assigning the logical OR result of `TxDonePulse`, `TxAbortPulse`, and `TxRetryPulse` to `ResetTxBDReady`. This means that `ResetTxBDReady` will be set to True (1) if any of the following signals are True: `TxDonePulse`, `TxAbortPulse`, or `TxRetryPulse`. It essentially serves as a reset signal for the transmitter block descriptor (BD), signifying that the current transmission is complete, aborted, or needs to be retried."
