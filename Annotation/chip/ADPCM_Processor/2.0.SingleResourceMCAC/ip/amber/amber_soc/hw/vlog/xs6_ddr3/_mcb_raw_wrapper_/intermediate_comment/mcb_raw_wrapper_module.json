    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper for various DDR memory types. It manages multiple memory ports, handles address mapping, and controls data read/write operations. The module uses IODRP2 components for signal calibration and IOB instantiations for physical memory interface. It supports different port configurations and data widths, providing a flexible interface between user logic and memory controller. The implementation includes clock management, reset control, and calibration logic to ensure proper memory operations and timing."
