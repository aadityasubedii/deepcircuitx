    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for managing the states of the 'EndBusy' and 'EndBusy_d' flags relative to the system clock ('Clk') or Reset signal. The block is implemented using always block triggered at the positive edge of 'Clk' or 'Reset'. Upon receiving a 'Reset' signal, both 'EndBusy' and 'EndBusy_d' are synchronously reset to zero. Otherwise, 'EndBusy' follows the value of 'EndBusy_d' and 'EndBusy_d' is assigned the inversion of 'InProgress_q2' ANDed with 'InProgress_q3', effectively indicating a job has finished when both these flags are low."
