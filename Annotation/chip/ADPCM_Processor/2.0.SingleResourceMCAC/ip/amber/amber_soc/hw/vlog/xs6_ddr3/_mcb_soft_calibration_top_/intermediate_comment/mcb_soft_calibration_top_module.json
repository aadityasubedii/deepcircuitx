    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, 'mcb_soft_calibration_top', serves as a top-level manager for memory controller block (MCB) calibration. It uses parameters and input signals to control calibration strategy and MCB operations. Internally, several signals facilitate synchronization, data handling and buffering, inter-module communication, and calibration processes. The module interfaces with 'mcb_soft_calibration' and 'IOBUF' modules and optionally generates additional IOBUF and IODRP2 modules for ZIO, based on the defined parameters. Its outputs represent various MCB-related signals and calibration statuses. The specific functionality and interaction heavily rely on application context and underlying module specifics."
