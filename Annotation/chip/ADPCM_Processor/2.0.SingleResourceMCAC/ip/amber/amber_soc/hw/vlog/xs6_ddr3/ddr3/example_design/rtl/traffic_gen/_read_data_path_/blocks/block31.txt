This block of Verilog code is responsible for managing the force write command timeout counter. The block is triggered at the positive edge of the input clock. If the system is reset, or if a specific condition dealing with 'wait_bl_end' is met, the counter is reset. However, if 'force_writecmd_gen' is true, the counter is incremented. This block essentially ensures that the counter only increases under certain conditions and is reset under certain other conditions, providing control over the timeout behavior.
