    "module": "Module-level comment: The eth_txstatem module is an Ethernet transmission state machine handling transmission processes and issues like collision and under-runs. The module uses various input status signals representing transmission conditions to control the flow and transition across multiple states like IPG, Preamble, Data Transmission, Padding, Jamming, backed by well-defined boolean logic. It uses output and internal signals to indicate the current state and manage state transitions, achieving efficient and reliable Ethernet transmission."
