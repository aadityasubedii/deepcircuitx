    "block_comment": "This block of code dictates the conditions for initiating the transmission of a packet in a digital communication system. The module utilizes a synchronous design along with various flag signals such as 'TxDone_wb', 'tx_burst_en', and 'MasterWbTX' to facilitate packet transmission. The 'always' block triggers at the rising edge of the 'WB_CLK_I' clock signal or a system 'Reset'. On a 'Reset', the 'TxDonePacket' signal is set to '0'. Otherwise, if the predefined conditions are met (which account for single or continuous packet transmission modes and ensuring the master has completed its operations), 'TxDonePacket' is set to '1', meaning the packet is ready for transmission. In other scenarios, 'TxDonePacket' is cleared to '0'."
