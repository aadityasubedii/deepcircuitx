The block of code performs state transitions and sets the necessary parameters for memory cell address, read/write mode, and data to be written in the Write_P state. In this state, the memory cell to be written is determined by the PTerm, the write mode is set, and the write data is formed from P_Term_w. When this state ends, depending on the conditions not visible in this snippet, it either transitions to LDQS_PIN_N_TERM_WAIT or UDQS_CLK_WRITE_P_TERM state. The actual execution of writing into the memory cell does not occur in this block, but it prepares all the necessary parameters and conditions for the forthcoming operation.
