    "block_comment": "The block of code essentially updates the variable `ByteCntDelayed` with the sum of `ByteCnt` and the hexadecimal number `0x4`. The action is implemented through an `assign` statement, a continuous assignment in Verilog, which means the value of `ByteCntDelayed` will consistently represent the current value of `ByteCnt` plus `0x4`, even as `ByteCnt` changes."
