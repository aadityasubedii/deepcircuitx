It is sourced from the PLL. \n\n4. mcb_drp_clk_bufg_in: This is the input to the clock buffer for the mcb_drp_clk clock. This is also sourced from PLL.\n\n5. clkfbout_clkfbin: This is the feedback signal for the PLL. It is used to adjust the PLL's output based on actual operating conditions.\n\n6. locked: This indicates that the PLL has achieved lock and is generating the correct clock frequencies.\n\n7. rst0_sync_r: This is a vector that holds the status of the reset signal synced to clk0 for several past periods. \n\n8. rst_tmp: This is a temporary internal signal used to generate a synchronous reset signal 'rst0'. \n\n9. powerup_pll_locked: It is a signal that is set when the PLL reaches a locked state after the system reset is deasserted during bootup.\n\n10. syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked: It is a signal that is set when the PLL reaches a locked state after the clk0 reset is deasserted during bootup.\n\n11. sys_rst: This is the internal system reset signal which factors in the active level of the reset (active high or low).\n\n12. bufpll_mcb_locked: This is a signal that indicates the locking status of the MCB PLL.\n\n13. sys_clk_ibufg: This is the output signal from the input clock buffer, which is used when the clock signal needs to be distributed across the FPGA in a fan-out manner. This signal would either take the differential input clock or the single-ended input clock based on the parameter configuration."

                    "text": "Module name: infrastructure.\nModule specification: The 'infrastructure' is a Verilog RTL module designed for a clocking infrastructure and a reset synchronization circuit in a digital system. It takes as inputs system clock (sys_clk, sys_clk_p, sys_clk_n) and reset (sys_rst_i) signals and generates multiple clock (clk0, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90) and reset (rst0, async_rst) signals. It features a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) that aids in the generation of various clock frequencies, and a synchronization mechanism to align the reset signals with the clocks, eliminating potential metastability issues.\n\nThe module relies on internal signals like clk_2x_0, clk_2x_180 (for doubled and 180 degrees phase-shifted clock), sys_rst (internal system reset), locked (PLL's status), rst0_sync_r (reset signal vector synced with clk0), powerup_pll_locked (shutdown signal for PLL), and sys_clk_ibufg (output from input clock buffer) among others, to execute its functionalities.\n\nThe code is organized into several blocks. The 'generate' block determines the application of either differential or single-ended system clock. The PLL instantiation initializes the parameters and generates multiple clock frequencies. Buffers are applied to clock signals for reducing skew and effective fan-out across the FPGA. The 'always' blocks deal with the synchronization of reset signals with the clk0 and mcb_drp_clk. Finally, a BUFPLL_MCB block that provides clock and strobe signals to the Multi Controller Buses (MCB) in the Xilinx FPGA is used.\n"
