    "block_comment": "This block represents the instantiation of an Output Buffer (OBUFT) in Verilog. Its main function is to drive the external Memory Controller Block (MCB) clock enable signal (mcbx_dram_cke) based on the internal clock enable (ioi_cke) signal and the control signal (t_cke). The OBUFT uses the input control signal (t_cke) to either pass the internal clock enable signal (ioi_cke) to the output if it's high, or it isolates the output (tri-states) when the control signal (t_cke) is low."
