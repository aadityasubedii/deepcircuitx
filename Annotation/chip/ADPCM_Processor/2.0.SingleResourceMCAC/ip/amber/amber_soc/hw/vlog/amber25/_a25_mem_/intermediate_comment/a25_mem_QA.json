It processes memory requests (both reading and writing) from the CPU, deciding whether the requests can be serviced from the cache or if an external memory access is necessary. It also includes functionality to handle requests for specific byte blocks, address validity checks, and support for the format in which data is returned to the CPU. Furthermore, the module contains mechanisms to help manage memory stalls (i.e., when memory can't service a request immediately) and cache flushing. It also determines whether the addressed data is cacheable. The module uses an underlying cache unit (a25_dcache)."
