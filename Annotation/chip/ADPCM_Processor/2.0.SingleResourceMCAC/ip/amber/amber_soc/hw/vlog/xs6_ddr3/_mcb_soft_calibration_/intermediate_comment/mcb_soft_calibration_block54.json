    "block_comment": "This block assigns the boolean value of `Inc_Flag` based on a comparison operation. It checks if the `TARGET_DQS_DELAY` is greater than `DQS_DELAY`. The `Inc_Flag` is set to True if `TARGET_DQS_DELAY` is greater; otherwise, it's set to False. This flag might be used to indicate when a certain delay target is surpassed."
