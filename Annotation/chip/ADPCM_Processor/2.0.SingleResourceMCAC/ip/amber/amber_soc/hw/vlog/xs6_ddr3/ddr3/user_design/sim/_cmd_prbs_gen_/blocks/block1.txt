This block of code is meant for assignment in Verilog. It assigns the value of the signal `prbs` to the output `prbs_o`. This is a straightforward assignment statement, where `prbs_o` will now hold the exact same value as `prbs`. The assignment action is completed on every positive edge of the clock signal, ensuring synchronization.
