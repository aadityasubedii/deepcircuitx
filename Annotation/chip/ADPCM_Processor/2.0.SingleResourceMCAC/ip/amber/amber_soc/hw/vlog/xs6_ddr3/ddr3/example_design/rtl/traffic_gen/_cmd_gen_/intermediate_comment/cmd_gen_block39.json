    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for updating the `addr_mode_reg` register based on certain conditions. The code block listens for the rising edge of `clk_i` clock signal. If the 4th index of the `rst_i` reset signal is on, then it checks whether the `CMD_PATTERN` is set to \"CGEN_BRAM\". If it is, the `addr_mode_reg` is set to a binary value of \"000\" after a delay specified by `TCQ`. Otherwise, it is set to \"011\". If the `rst_i` reset signal is not activated, but `mode_load_pulse` is asserted, then it directly takes the value from the `addr_mode_i` input signal after the same `TCQ` delay."
