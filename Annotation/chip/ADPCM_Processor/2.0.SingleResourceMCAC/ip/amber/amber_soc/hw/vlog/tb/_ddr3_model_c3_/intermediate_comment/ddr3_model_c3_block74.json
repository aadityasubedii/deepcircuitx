    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is functioned to call the `dq_timing_check` function whenever there's a change in the 57th bit of the `dq_in` input signal. The achieved function is done by utilizing the `always @` block to monitor the 57th bit of `dq_in` (as represented by `dq_in[56]` since indexing starts from zero) and subsequently invoking the `dq_timing_check` function with '56' as its argument whenever a change is detected."
