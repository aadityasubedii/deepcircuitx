    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns the value of 'cmp_data_o' based on the type of FAMILY. If the FAMILY is equal to \"SPARTAN6\", 'cmp_data_o' takes the value of 'cmp_data_r3'. If the FAMILY is not \"SPARTAN6\", 'cmp_data_o' takes the value of 'cmp_data_r2'. The purpose of this statement is to implement a type of multiplexing operation, conditional on the FAMILY type."
