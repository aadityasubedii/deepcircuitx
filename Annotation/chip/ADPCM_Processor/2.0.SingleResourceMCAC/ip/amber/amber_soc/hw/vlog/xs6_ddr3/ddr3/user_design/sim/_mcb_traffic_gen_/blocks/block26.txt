Comment: 
This line of code is responsible for assigning a specific fragment of the input from the "bram_cmd_i" command to the input of "bram_bl_i". It achieves this by using the assign keyword, specific to Verilog RTL, which transfers the information from the bits 33th to 38th of "bram_cmd_i" and assigns it into the first six bits of "bram_bl_i".
