    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code allows the control of Command interface signals when the third port mode is enabled. If the Enable Port 3 bit (C_PORT_ENABLE[2]) is set, this block assigns signal values coming from the modules interfacing to the MIG controller. These signals include arbitration enable, command signal clock, control enable, rank, bank, column address, instruction and burst length. Otherwise, if the Enable Port 3 is not set, the command signals are set to 0."
