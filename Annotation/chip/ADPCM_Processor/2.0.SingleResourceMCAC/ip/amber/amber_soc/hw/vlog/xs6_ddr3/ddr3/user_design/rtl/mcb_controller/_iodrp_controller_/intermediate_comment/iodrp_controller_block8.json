    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code effectively represents a shift register. At every positive edge of the clock (DRP_CLK), it checks if a synchronous reset (sync_rst) has been signaled\u2014if so, it resets the shift_through_reg register to an 8-bit zero. Otherwise, if the load_shift_n command is true, it loads the data from the output multiplexer (data_out_mux) into the shift register. If not, it performs a left shift operation by concatenating the DRP_SDO bit and the top 7 bits of the current shift_through_reg, essentially shifting out the last bit."
