    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a boolean AND operation on two inputs: 'upper_end_matched' and 'lower_end_matched'. The result of this operation, captured by the boolean variable 'tst_matched', is true only when both 'upper_end_matched' and 'lower_end_matched' are true. The 'assign' keyword is used to define this continuous assignment which is then immediately evaluated."
