This block triggers a timing check function every time there's a negative edge transition in the second bit of the `dqs_in` input array. It utilizes an `always` block that listens to negative edge triggering and invokes the function `dqs_neg_timing_check` with an argument of `1`, providing a detailed control of specific data queue signals.
