    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is essentially a Multi-Cycle Synchronous Reset Flip-Flop (SRFF) that handles the state of the 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync3' signal. On a positive edge either from 'MTxClk' (main transmission clock) or 'Reset', the block of code updates the signal 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync3'. If a reset condition is detected, it asserts 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync3' to logic low, effectively clearing or resetting it. If the reset is not active, it keeps the status of the 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync3' signal, effectively latching its previous state from 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync2' in sync with the clock. This latch operation makes it useful in a synchronous digital system where data integrity and synchronization are paramount. The '#Tp' allows the designer to control the period for which the signal transition occurs."
