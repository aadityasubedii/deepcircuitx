Comment: 
The block manages a signal flag depending on a certain user-count condition and data readiness. Upon each rising edge of the system clock (`clk_i`), it examines if `user_burst_cnt` is equal to 2 and if the `data_rdy_i` signal is on. If these conditions are fulfilled, the signal `next_count_is_one` is set to one with a delay defined by `#TCQ` after this positive edge clocking instance. Otherwise, `next_count_is_one` is set to zero again with the same delay.
