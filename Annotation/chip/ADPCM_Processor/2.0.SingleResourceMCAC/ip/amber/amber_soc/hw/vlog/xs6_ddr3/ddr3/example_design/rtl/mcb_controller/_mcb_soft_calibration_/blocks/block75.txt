Comment: 
The given block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the reset signal. It is triggered at the positive edge of the UI_CLK signal or non-violating_rst signal. In the event of non_violating_rst or when the 16th bit of the WAIT_200us_COUNTER is not set, the RST_reg is set to high (1'b1). Otherwise, the RST_reg takes on the value of rst_tmp. This block ensures that the reset functionality is taken care of appropriately depending on the state of the non_violating_rst signal and WAIT_200us_COUNTER.
