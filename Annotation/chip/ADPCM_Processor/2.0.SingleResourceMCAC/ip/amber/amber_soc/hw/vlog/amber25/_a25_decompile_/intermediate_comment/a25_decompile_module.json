    "module": "Module-level comment: This module decompiles ARM processor instructions for debugging and analysis. It takes instruction execution signals, decodes various instruction types, formats them with arguments, and writes human-readable disassembly to a file. The module handles different instruction formats, interrupt logging, and jump tracing, providing a detailed execution trace of the processor. It uses combinational logic for instruction decoding and sequential logic for writing to the output file on each clock cycle."
