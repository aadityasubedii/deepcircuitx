    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is set up to trigger the 'dm_timing_check' function whenever there's a change in the 12th bit of the 'dm_in' input array. The block detects an event-triggered on the rise or fall of the given bit and calls the function 'dm_timing_check' with an argument of '11'. This implementation works as an edge-triggered function call which is especially useful in detecting changes and acting upon them in real-time systems and digital circuitry."
