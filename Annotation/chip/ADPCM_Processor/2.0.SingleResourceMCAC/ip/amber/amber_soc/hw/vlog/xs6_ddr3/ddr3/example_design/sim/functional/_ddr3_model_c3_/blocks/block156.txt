Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog initiates a command address timing check whenever a change is observed in the ninth bit of the address input. Specifically, the procedure `cmd_addr_timing_check()` is triggered with a delay of `15` units upon any change - either a transition from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 - in the bit at position `8` of the address input (`addr_in`). The procedure `cmd_addr_timing_check()` is expected to perform a timing check related to the command address, mainly for debugging or production-line testing purposes.
