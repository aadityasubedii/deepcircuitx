    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'Infrastructure' module manages multiple clocks for use in FPGA implementations by creating, dividing, phase-shifting, and distributing clocks. It accomplishes this with a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), clock buffers, and a differential clock scheme via the IBUFGDS block. It also generates reset signals and uses various registers and conditional logic for synchronization. Internal signals monitor state changes and external parameters customize the module's functions, making 'Infrastructure' versatile for many system requirements."
