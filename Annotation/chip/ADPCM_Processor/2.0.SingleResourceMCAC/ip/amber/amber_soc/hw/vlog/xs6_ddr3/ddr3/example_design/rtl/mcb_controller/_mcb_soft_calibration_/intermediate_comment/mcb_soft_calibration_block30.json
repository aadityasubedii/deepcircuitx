    "block_comment": "This block writes the P-Termination values to the UDQS PIN. The block sets the memory cell address to PTerm and the read/write value to write mode. It then writes a composite value, which includes a 2-bit value and a P_Term_s value, into the IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA register. The MCB_UIADDR register is set to the UDQS_PIN memory location, while MCB_CMD_VALID is set to 1 indicating that the command is valid. If MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is true, the state remains in UDQS_PIN_WRITE_P_TERM, otherwise the state transitions to UDQS_PIN_P_TERM_WAIT."
