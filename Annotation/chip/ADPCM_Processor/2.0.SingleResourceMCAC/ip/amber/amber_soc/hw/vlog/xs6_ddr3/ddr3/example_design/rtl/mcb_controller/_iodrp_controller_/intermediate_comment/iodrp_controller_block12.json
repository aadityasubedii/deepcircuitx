The block uses an always block that triggers at any change in the 'state' variable, combined with a case statement mapping each state (READY, DECIDE, ADDR_PHASE, ADDR_TO_DATA_GAP, ADDR_TO_DATA_GAP2, ADDR_TO_DATA_GAP3, DATA_PHASE, ALMOST_READY) to the assignment of the corresponding ASCII string value to 'state_ascii'."
