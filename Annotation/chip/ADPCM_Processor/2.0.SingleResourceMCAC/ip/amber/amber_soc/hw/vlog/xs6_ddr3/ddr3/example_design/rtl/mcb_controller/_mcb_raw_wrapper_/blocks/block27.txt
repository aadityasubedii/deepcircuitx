Comment: 
This block of code defines an Octal Serializer/Deserializer 2 (OSERDES2) with specific instantiation parameters, meant for outputting serialized data. The block achieves this by accepting inputs of control signals and data, and outputting the serialized data, with its behaviour defined by the instanced parameters. The data rate, operating mode, width, and pattern used for training are all defined. The input clocks are controlled by `CLK0`, `CLK1` and `CLKDIV`, ensuring precise timing for operations. The module also interfaces with the PLL Clock Enable (`IOCE`) and the Lock Detect (`OCE`) signals, and data bits `D1` & `D2`. Unused signals are grounded.
