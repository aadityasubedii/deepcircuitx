    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for invoking `dq_timing_check` function whenever there's a change in the 40th bit of `dq_in` signal. The code is using an always block which triggers on any event related to `dq_in[39]`. It therefore ensures that `dq_timing_check(39)` is called to check or possibly alter timing properties associated with the 40th bit of the `dq_in` input signal."
