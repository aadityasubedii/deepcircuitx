Comment: 
This block serves as a synchronous reset for setting the Transmit Control Interrupt (SetTxCIrq) in Verilog code. When the system clock ('Clk') has a positive edge signal or a reset ('Reset') signal arises, the if-else statement executes. If a reset condition is detected, 'SetTxCIrq_sync2' is delayed by propagation delay ('Tp') time units and is subsequently set to zero. Otherwise, it carries the value of the preceding network stage ('SetTxCIrq_sync1') with a delay of 'Tp' time units.
