    "block_comment": "This block carries out the generation of a signal to indicate end of a frame in a receiver data path. The signal `GenerateRxEndFrm` is assigned a logical function that depends on the current `StateData[0]`, the negation of `MRxDV`, and two other conditions. If `StateData[0]` is true (active), the `GenerateRxEndFrm` signal will be activated either when `MRxDV` is not set (which means that the reception of data is not valid) and `ByteCntGreat2` or when `ByteCntMaxFrame` is valid. The conditions `ByteCntGreat2` and `ByteCntMaxFrame` seem to be checks related to received data's byte count. Thus, this block serves an important role in the data reception and frame ending process by setting specific conditions based on the state and received byte count."
