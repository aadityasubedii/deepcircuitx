Comment: 
This block of code is dedicated to controlling I/O drive and read points (IODRP) under different active states. Dependent on the active state of  IODRP defined by 'Active_IODRP', different configurations are implemented. If 'Active_IODRP' is 'RZQ', 'IODRP_CS' is output to 'RZQ_IODRP_CS', and 'RZQ_IODRP_SDO' is output to 'IODRP_SDO'. If 'Active_IODRP' is 'ZIO', the roles of 'RZQ_IODRP_CS' and 'ZIO_IODRP_CS' are interchangeably used with 'ZIO_IODRP_SDO' delivered to 'IODRP_SDO'. For 'MCB_PORT' or any undefined states, 'RZQ_IODRP_CS', 'ZIO_IODRP_CS', and 'IODRP_SDO' are all set to zero.
