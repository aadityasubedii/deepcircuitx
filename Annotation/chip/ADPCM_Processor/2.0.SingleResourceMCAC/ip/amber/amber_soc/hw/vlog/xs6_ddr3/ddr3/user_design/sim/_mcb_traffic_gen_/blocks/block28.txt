Comment: 
This block assigns a 32-bit address for a Block RAM (BRAM), extracting the address value from the `bram_cmd_i` signal. The implementation uses a concatenation operation where it appends 2'b00 to the lower bit places of `bram_cmd_i[29:0]` in order to form the final 32-bit BRAM address (`bram_addr_i`). This is consistent with addressing schemes where the last 2 bits are discarded, and only upper 30 bits are used.
