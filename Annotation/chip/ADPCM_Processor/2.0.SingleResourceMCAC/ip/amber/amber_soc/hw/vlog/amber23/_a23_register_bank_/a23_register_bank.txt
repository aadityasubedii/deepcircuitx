Module-Level Comment: The a23_register_bank module serves as a register bank in a processor, providing storage for data values used in processor operations. It differentiates handling of registers based on execution modes (user, supervisor, IRQ, FIRQ). It uses input signals to control operations (like write enables, mode controls) and internal signals to represent the physical and banked registers. The module updates register values synchronously with the clock signal. Outputs include source/destination register content and program counter, available for further computation in the processor.
