    "block_comment": "The block generates an output buffer for UDM (unmask data mask) for external DRAM memory interface with 16 data quality (DQ) pins. When the number of DQ pins is specified as 16, an instance 'iob_udm' of the OBUFT (output buffer tri-state) module is created, which connects the internal signal 'ioi_udm' to the output 'mcbx_dram_udm' through a tri-state buffer. The tri-state buffer is controlled by the 't_udm' signal."
