Comment: 
The block of code handles the assignment of the 'bl_mode_sel' based on different conditions. If a reset input ('rst_i') is provided or if the value of 'FAMILY' is "VIRTEX6", then 'bl_mode_sel' is assigned the value of 'FIXED_BL_MODE' or 'PRBS_BL_MODE' respectively. However, if neither of these conditions is met and if the 'vio_modify_enable' value is '1', then 'bl_mode_sel' is assigned the 'vio_bl_mode_value'. The assignment is performed at every positive edge of the clock signal.
