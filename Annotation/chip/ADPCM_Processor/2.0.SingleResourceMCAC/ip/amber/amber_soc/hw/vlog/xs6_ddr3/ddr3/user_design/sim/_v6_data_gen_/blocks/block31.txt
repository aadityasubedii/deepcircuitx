Comment: 
This Verilog code block is a data generator controlled by the clock signal 'clk_i'. Upon the rising edge of 'clk_i', if 'fifo_rdy_i' active or the command 'cmd_startC' received, the block generates data (w1data) based on address inputs and data mode. The data is generated through a selection of data generation functions 'Data_Gen' and 'Data_GenW0', depending on the bitwise value of 'data_mode_i'. Each sub-block under the case statement corresponds to different address inputs obtained by slicing 'addr_i', they perform the same data-generation operations respectively. An exception defaults to zero if the address is not a certain range. Moreover, if the memory burst length (MEM_BURST_LEN) is 8, the block performs a specific shift operation on w1data at certain intervals defined by the total number of DQ pins (NUM_DQ_PINS).
