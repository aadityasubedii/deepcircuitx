This block of code implements a counter for the command timeout function in a system syncronized to a positive edge clock signal. If the input reset signal's least significant bit is high or if the wait_bl_end signal transitions from high to low, the counter is reset to zero. Otherwise, if the force_wrcmd_gen signal is high, the current counter value is incremented.
