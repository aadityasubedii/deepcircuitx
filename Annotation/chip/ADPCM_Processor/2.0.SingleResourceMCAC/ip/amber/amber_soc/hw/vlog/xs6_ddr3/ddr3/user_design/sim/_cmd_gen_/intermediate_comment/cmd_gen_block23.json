    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code designates a flip-flop to register a mode loading signal. The flip-flop's output changes only on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk_i). The registered signal, 'mode_load_pulse', is delayed by a timing control quantity (TCQ) and then assigned to 'mode_load_pulse_r1'. This allows loading modes at a specific point in the clock cycle, ensuring synchronization and timing integrity of the system."
