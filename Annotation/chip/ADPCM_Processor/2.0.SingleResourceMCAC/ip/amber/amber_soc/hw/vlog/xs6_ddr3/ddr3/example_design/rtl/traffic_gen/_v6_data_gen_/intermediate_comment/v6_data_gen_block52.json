    "block_comment": "The block of code is a conditional data pattern generator for a system with 40 data query (DQ) pins. If the system has exactly 40 DQ pins and the data pattern is either \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\", it will enter this block of operation during the positive edge of the input clock signal. This is implemented using an \"always\" block which executes at the positive edge of the clock, encapsulated within a \"generate\" block that conditionally generates appropriate Verilog code based on the number of DQ pins and the specified data pattern."
