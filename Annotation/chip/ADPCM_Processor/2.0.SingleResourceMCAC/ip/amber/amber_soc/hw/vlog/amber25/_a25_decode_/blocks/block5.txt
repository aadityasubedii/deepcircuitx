Comment: 
This block of code is used to generate a `dabt` signal. It utilises a logical OR operation to combine the current value of the `dabt_reg` signal and the current value of the `i_dabt` signal. If either or both of these signals are asserted (`1`), the `dabt` signal is also asserted, otherwise (`0`), `dabt` is deasserted.
