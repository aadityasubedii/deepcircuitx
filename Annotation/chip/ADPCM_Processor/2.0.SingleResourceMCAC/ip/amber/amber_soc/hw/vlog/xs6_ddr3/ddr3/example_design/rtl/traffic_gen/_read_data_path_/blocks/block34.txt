Comment: 
This block is involved in the sequential capturing of input data and an internal signal at rising edges of an input clock. It uses delay models ('#TCQ') for timing control. On every positive edge of 'clk_i', it captures the status of 'wait_bl_end' into 'wait_bl_end_r1' and the current input data 'data_i' into 'rd_data_r'. Then, it introduces delay, cycling the captured data through the variables 'rd_data_r2', 'rd_data_r3', and 'rd_data_r4' in subsequent clock cycles.
