    "block_comment": "This line of code checks for a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) error. The function of this block is to verify the integrity of the data by comparing the current CRC value, indicated by 'Crc[31:0]', with the fixed predefined constant value '32'hC704DD7B'. If the current CRC doesn't match the predefined value, a CRC error, referred to as 'CrcError', is flaggled, indicating potential data corruption."
