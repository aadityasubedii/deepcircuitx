    "block_comment": "This Verilog task is a procedure (`mtrans_args`) that prints details of a specific machine instruction execution steps to a file (`decompile_file`). It iterates through all 16 steps of the instruction (`execute_instruction`), including warming up registers and indicating steps where more actions to come. A special case is handled for the instruction, when its 22:20 bits are '100', it writes '^' to the file. It also writes special characters like '!', '{', '}', and ',' in the file to denote specific execution states."
