Module-level comment: This module implements a 1024x128-bit SRAM with byte-level write enable functionality. It uses 8 RAMB16BWER primitives to create two memory banks, each with 512 words of 128 bits. The module supports separate read and write operations, with selective byte writing. It uses the most significant address bit to select between banks and provides initialization parameters for each RAM block.
