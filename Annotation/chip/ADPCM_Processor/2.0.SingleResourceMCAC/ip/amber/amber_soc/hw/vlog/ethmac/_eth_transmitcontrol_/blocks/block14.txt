This block of code performs the task of managing the transmission of a control frame in a communication system. Specifically, it uses a synchronous reset 'TxReset' and positive edge-triggered clock 'MTxClk' to control the signals. If 'TxReset' is high, it will reset the status of 'SendingCtrlFrm' to 0. If 'WillSendControlFrame' and 'TxCtrlStartFrm' are high indicating that a control frame needs to be sent, 'SendingCtrlFrm' is set to 1. If 'TxDoneIn' is high, meaning the transmission is completed, 'SendingCtrlFrm' is reset to 0. The control signals are updated on either a positive edge of the clock or if the reset signal is active.
