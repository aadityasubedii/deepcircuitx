    "block_comment": "This block of code monitors the reset signal in a Verilog-based hardware design. If the time duration between the assertion of the reset signal exceeds 100,000 units, an error message is displayed with specific details about the violation. This operation is triggered at the positive edge of the reset signal and the time of assertion is stored in 'tm_rst_n' to be used for subsequent calculations."
