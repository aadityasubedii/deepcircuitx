    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a value to the signal `Inc_Flag` based on a comparison between `TARGET_DQS_DELAY` and `DQS_DELAY`. It essentially acts as a condition checker where the `Inc_Flag` is set to high if `TARGET_DQS_DELAY` is greater than `DQS_DELAY`. This kind of implementation could be useful to trigger future operations or events based on the value of `Inc_Flag`, for instance, incrementing `DQS_DELAY` when `Inc_Flag` is high."
