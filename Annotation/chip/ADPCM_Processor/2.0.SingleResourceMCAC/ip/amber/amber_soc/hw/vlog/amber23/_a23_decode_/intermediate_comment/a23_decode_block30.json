    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a value to the signal `und_request` based on the value of `itype` and the 4-bit field from `instruction[11:8]`. It checks whether the `itype` equals `CODTRANS` or `COREGOP` or if `itype` equals `CORTRANS` but `instruction[11:8]` field does not equal to decimal 15. In such cases, a true or '1' value is assigned to `und_request`. Otherwise, it outputs a false or '0' value."
