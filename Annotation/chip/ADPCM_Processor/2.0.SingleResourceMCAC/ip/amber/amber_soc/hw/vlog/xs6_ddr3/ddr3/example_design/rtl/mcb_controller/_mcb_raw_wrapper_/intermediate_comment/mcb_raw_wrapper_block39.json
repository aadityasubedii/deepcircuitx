    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a counter that resets every 200 microseconds. It either increments at every positive edge of the ui_clk signal or resets upon the positive edge of the int_sys_rst signal. If the int_sys_rst is high, the counter is reset to zero. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by one each time until the 16th bit of wait_200us_counter is flipped, indicating that the counter has reached the 200 microsecond limit, at which point the counter is held constant until a reset occurs."
