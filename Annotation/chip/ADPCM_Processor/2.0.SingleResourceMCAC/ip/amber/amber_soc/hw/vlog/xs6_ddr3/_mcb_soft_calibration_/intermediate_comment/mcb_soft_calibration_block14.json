    "block_comment": "The block of code initializes the dynamic calibration process and conditions the system into different states based on various conditions. Initially, this block sets the `LastPass_DynCal` to a default pass, disables the `MCB_UICMDEN`, sets the `MCB_UIDONECAL` and `Pre_SYSRST` to high indicating that calibration is completed and a reset is required. If the calibration mode is not equal to CALIBRATION, it switches the state to `START_DYN_CAL`. However, if the system reset pulse width is verified(ok), it updates the state to `WAIT_FOR_UODONE` meaning the system is waiting for further commands."
