    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for clock enabling and training in the system. Embedded within are two sequential logic circuits working under positive edges of 'ui_clk' and 'int_sys_rst', alongside combinational logic circuits to control and monitor the state of these circuits. If the system reset 'int_sys_rst' is activated, it sets 'cke_train_reg' to '0'. Otherwise, it checks for the status of 'wait_200us_done_r1' and its previous state, and if true, 'cke_train_reg' is set to '1'. If 'uo_done_cal' condition is true, 'cke_train_reg' is reset to '0'. The 'cke_train' is assigned the state of 'cke_train_reg'."
