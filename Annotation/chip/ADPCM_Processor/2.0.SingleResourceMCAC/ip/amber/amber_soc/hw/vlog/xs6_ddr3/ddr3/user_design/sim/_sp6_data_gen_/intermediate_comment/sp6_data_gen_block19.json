    "block_comment": "This block represents a conditional statement within a generate construct in Verilog. The conditional expression checks if either DWIDTH is 64 or 128. The mechanism achieves its function by employing a generation scheme. The subsequent logic block labeled as SHIFT_VALUE will be generated if DWIDTH is 64 or 128. As it is wrapped by generate and endgenerate keywords, it enables conditional compilation of code blocks based on parameters or preprocessor macros."
