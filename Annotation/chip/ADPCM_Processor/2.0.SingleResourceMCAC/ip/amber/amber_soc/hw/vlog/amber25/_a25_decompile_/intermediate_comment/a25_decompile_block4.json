    "block_comment": "This block of code is a function in Verilog that fetches certain 1-bit signals based on the input variable. Depending on the 3-bit input 'num', the function routes to different signals from various modules and returns the specific 1-bit signal. These signals are used to control or indicate certain statuses in system like write enable for U_EXECUTE module or memory stall for U_AMBER module, data address valid for U_EXECUTE module, etc."
