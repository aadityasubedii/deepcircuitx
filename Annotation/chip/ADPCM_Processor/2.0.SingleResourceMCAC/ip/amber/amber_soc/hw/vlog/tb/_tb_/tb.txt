Module-level comment: The 'tb' module represents a test bench for the Amber-based CPU system, DDR3 memory, and hardware peripherals like Ethernet and UART on FPGAs. It manages system setup, timing ('clk_*', 'sysrst'), data loading in memory, and real-time interaction with hardware. Various system states are controlled via registers and wires, while different dedicated components instantiated handle specific tasks. The communication protocols, memory control, and debugging tools enable the comprehensive testing and monitoring of the system.
