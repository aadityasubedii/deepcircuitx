    "block_comment": "This block of code cycles through the Digital Quadrature Signal at each positive edge of the 24th element of the dqs_in array. It achieves this by making use of a timing check function, \u2018dqs_neg_timing_check\u2019, for each positive edge transition of the 24th index (23 in zero-based index) of the Digital Quadrature Signals array 'dqs_in'. It invokes the \u2018dqs_neg_timing_check\u2019 function with '23' as an argument whenever a positive edge transition is detected."
