    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for generating a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS). It works by continuously assigning the current value of the `lfsr_q` signal (from the first bit up to the `PRBS_WIDTH` bit) to the `prbs` signal whenever there is any change in the `lfsr_q` signal. The `always` block is sensitive to the mentioned bits of `lfsr_q`, ensuring that the PRBS changes whenever these specific bits of `lfsr_q` change."
