    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code updates three registers: data_mode_rr_a, data_mode_rr_b, and data_mode_rr_c, synchronously with the rising edge of input clock, clk_i. The assignment to these registers is delayed by the amount of time specified by TCQ. This implementation can be done by using non-blocking assignments of Verilog that allows multiple assignments to be made at the same time. The data_mode_i input signal is fetched simultaneously into the three registers."
