    "block_comment": "This block of code handles interrupt signals in a digital system. When the i_fetch_stall is low on the rising clock edge, the current interrupt type (i_interrupt) gets stored into the interrupt_d1 register. The block then checks if any interrupt is active and the system is in the interrupt state. If conditions are met, it logs the type of interrupt and its corresponding return address to the decompile_file. Different interrupt types are differentiated by using a case statement, allowing the system to handle various interrupt types properly like \"data abort\", \"firq\", \"irq\", etc. For each interrupt type, it retrieves the corresponding return address from registers 16 through 20, based on the interrupt type, and logs the hexadecimal value into the decompile_file."
