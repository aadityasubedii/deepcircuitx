    "block_comment": "This Verilog code is responsible for state management in a process. It transitions between states based on the evaluation of certain conditions. If the 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' signal is not asserted (i.e., is '0'), the system remains in the current 'WAIT8' state. If 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' is asserted (i.e., is '1'), then it checks another condition 'First_In_Term_Done'. If 'First_In_Term_Done' is true, it transitions to the 'START_DYN_CAL' state; if not, it transitions to the 'WRITE_CALIBRATE' state."
