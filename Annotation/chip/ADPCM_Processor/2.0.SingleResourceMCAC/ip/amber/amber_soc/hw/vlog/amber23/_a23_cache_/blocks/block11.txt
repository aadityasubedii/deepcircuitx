Comment: 
The block performs the function of multiplexing between different source selectors using conditional (ternary) operators. 5 source selectors are given as 'C_CORE', 'C_INIT', 'C_FILL', 'C_INVA', and an unknown state 'UNKNOWN'. The selected source, in turn, is decided based on the conditions, `source_sel[C_CORE]`, `source_sel[C_INIT]`, `source_sel[C_FILL]`, `source_sel[C_INVA]`, with the top priority given to 'C_CORE', and then 'C_INIT', and so on, with 'UNKNOWN' serving as the default when all conditions are false.
