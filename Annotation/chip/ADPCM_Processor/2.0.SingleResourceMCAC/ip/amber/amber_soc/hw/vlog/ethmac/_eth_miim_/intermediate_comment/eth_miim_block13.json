    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for creating a logic condition to initiate a data write operation. It uses the bitwise AND operation along with bitwise NOT operation on two single-bit signals, 'WCtrlDataStart_q1' and 'WCtrlDataStart_q2', within the Verilog RTL code. When 'WCtrlDataStart_q1' is true and 'WCtrlDataStart_q2' is false, this block triggers a 'WriteDataOp'. This technique is commonly used in pipelining stages, especially in handling control signals for reading and writing operations."
