    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code controls a data write operation's end condition. On every positive edge of the input clock, it checks if certain conditions are met. Specifically, it checks if the user burst count equals 2, or if a command has started, the bl_i variable equals 1, and the FAMILY is set to \"VIRTEX6\". If any of these conditions are met and the fifo (First In, First Out) is not full, it will set the data_wr_end_o to high (1), after a delay of TCQ. Otherwise, it sets data_wr_end_o immediately low (0) after a delay of TCQ."
