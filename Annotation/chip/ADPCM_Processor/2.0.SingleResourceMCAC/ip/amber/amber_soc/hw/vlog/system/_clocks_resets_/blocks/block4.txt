Comment: 
This block generates a simulated clock signal with a period defined by `pll_clk_period`. This is done by switching the value of `pll_clk_beh` between high (1) and low (0) states at intervals defined by half the `pll_clk_period`, effectively creating a pulse of full clock period equivalent to `pll_clk_period`. The operation is triggered at the positive edge of the signal `i_brd_clk_p`.
