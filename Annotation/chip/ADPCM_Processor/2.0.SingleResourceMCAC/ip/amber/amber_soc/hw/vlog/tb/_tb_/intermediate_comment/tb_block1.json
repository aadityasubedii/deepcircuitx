    "block_comment": "The function 'insert_32_into_128' injects a 32-bit word into a 128-bit word at specified positions. Based on the value of 'pos', the 2-bit selector, the 32-bit word 'word32' is inserted into the 128-bit word 'word128'. For pos=0, 'word32' is added at the lower end; for pos=1 and pos=2, 'word32' is placed in the middle; and for pos=3, 'word32' is set at the higher end. Inside the function, a case construction helps achieve this insertion."
