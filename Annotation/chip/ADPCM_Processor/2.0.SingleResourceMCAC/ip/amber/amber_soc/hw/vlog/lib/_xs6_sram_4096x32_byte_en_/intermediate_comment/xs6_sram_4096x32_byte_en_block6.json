    "block_comment": "This block is a RAM module that writes and reads a data chunk, as specified by 'i_write_data', from/to a specified address. It is controlled by enabling signals and manipulated using block statements as desired. The 'u_sram2' instance uses one clock signal 'i_clk' and address 'i_address' as inputs. Writing to the SRAM is controlled using 'wea_b0' signal to identify write-enable scenario. Reading from the SRAM is performed by providing address lines through 'i_address'. The output is taken from the 'data_out_b0' signal suggesting it is the container for the accessed data. The rest of the control/signals are kept idle suggesting this instance is operating in a write and single port mode."
