Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code responds to the falling edge of the third DQS input signal.  The always @ statement indicates that this block is sensitive to changes in dqs_in[2]. When a negative edge (falling edge) is detected, it calls the dqs_neg_timing_check(2) function, which checks the timing of the falling edge.
