Comment: 
The block assigns the value of `TxAbortOut`, which essentially decides on when a transmission abort is initiated. This is implemented through a conditional selection determined by `CtrlMux`. If `CtrlMux` is true, `TxAbortOut` is assigned the value resulting from the bitwise AND operation of the negation of `TxStartFrmIn`, the negation of `BlockTxDone`, and `MuxedAbort`. Otherwise, if `CtrlMux` is false, `TxAbortOut` is assigned the value resulting from the bitwise AND operation of the negation of `TxStartFrmIn`, the negation of `BlockTxDone`, and `TxAbortIn`.
