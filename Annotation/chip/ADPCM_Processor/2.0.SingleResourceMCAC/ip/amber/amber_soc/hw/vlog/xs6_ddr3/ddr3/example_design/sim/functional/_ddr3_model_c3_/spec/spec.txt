Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module represents a DDR3 SDRAM memory model, simulating the behavior of a DDR3 memory device including timing checks, command processing, and data read/write operations. The module has input ports for clock (ck, ck_n), control signals (cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank inputs (ba, addr), and data-related signals (dm_tdqs, dq, dqs, dqs_n, odt). It has an output port for tdqs_n and inout ports for bidirectional data transfer. Internally, it uses numerous signals to track timing parameters, state information, and implement various features of DDR3 SDRAM. The module is organized into several blocks, including initialization sequence handling, command decoding and execution, read/write operations
