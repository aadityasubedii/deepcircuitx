    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code manages command operations in different states (READY, REFRESH_ST, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT) of an interface handling data transfer and manipulation. The implementation uses a finite state machine approach, handling each state with specific commands and transitions based on various conditions. For instance, in the READY state, depending on the conditions `rdp_rdy_i`, `cmd_rd` and `cmd_fifo_rdy` or alternatives, either the READ, WRITE or REFRESH_ST operation is carried out, and corresponding flags (`push_cmd`, `xfer_cmd` etc.) are configured to control the data path. The machine stays in its current state or moves to a new state in every cycle, depending on the conditions inside each state block, hence effectively controlling the execution flow based on the state of data and command signals."
