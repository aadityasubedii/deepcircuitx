    "block_comment": "This block performs reset signals debouncing. It uses a clock edge-triggered always block to latch into registers (rst_ra and rst_rb) a 10 bit vector, created by repeating the input reset signal (rst_i), at the rising edge of the input clock signal (clk_i). The #TCQ delay element is used to model propagation delay, simulating the physical delay that'd be induced by hardware."
