This block of code manages the bridge between an external interface and internal registers of an interface module when the AXI interface is not enabled. It simply assigns the values from external interface signals to internal signals. The external arrays such as ```p2_arb_en```, ```p2_cmd_clk```, etc., are being assigned directly to the equivalent internal signals (designated by the ```_i``` suffix). These signals deal with enabling/disabling certain interfaces, setting command instructions, managing read/write operations, indicating error states, etc. This block is critical for maintaining the operational flow of the interface module when the AXI interface is disabled.
