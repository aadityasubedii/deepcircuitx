Comment: 
This block of code manages the lock signal (`syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked`) of a phase-locked loop (PLL) in a synchronous system. The `sys_rst` input is checked at every rising edge of the `clk0_bufg` system clock or whenever a system reset is signaled. If a system reset is triggered (`sys_rst` is high), the block resets the PLL's lock signal (`syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked`) to 0. In contrast, if the buffer PLL (`bufpll_mcb_locked`) is locked, the block sets the PLL's lock signal to 1.
