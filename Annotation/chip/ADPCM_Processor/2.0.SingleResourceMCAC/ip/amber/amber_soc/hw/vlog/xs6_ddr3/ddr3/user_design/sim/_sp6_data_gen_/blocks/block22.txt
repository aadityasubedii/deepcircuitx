Comment: 
The block performs data selection based on the value of `data_mode_i` input. There are several different data sources like `adata`, `hdata`, `ndata`, `w1data`, `fixed_data_i` and `prbs_data` which are used to assign the value of `data`. These sources are selected based on the value of `data_mode_i`. If a specific binary value of `data_mode_i` matches one of the cases, then `data` becomes the corresponding listed value. Also, in case of no match, `data` is defaulted to zero.
