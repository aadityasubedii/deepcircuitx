    "block_comment": "This block enables the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) functionality. It uses a logical OR operation ('|') to assign the CrcEnOut variable. If either the CrcEnIn input signal or the SendingCtrlFrm control signal is activated (has a value of 1), it'll trigger CrcEnOut, enabling the CRC functionality."
