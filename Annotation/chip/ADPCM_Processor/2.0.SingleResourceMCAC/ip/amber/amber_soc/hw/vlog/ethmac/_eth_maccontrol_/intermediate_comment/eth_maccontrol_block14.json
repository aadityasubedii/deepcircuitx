    "block_comment": "This block is a flip-flop for detection of transmitted used data output signal. It is sensitive to the positive edge of the multi-transmitter clock and reset sequence. Whenever a reset or transmission completion (either in the form of an abort or successful operation) is detected, the boolean flag 'TxUsedDataOutDetected' is set to 0 after a propagation delay 'Tp'. However, when used output data is transmitted, the flag is set to 1 after same delay, thus it serves as a signal for transmitted used data."
