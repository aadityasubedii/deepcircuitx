Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code activates a timing check function for command address whenever there's a change in the second-least-significant bit of the input address variable. The always @(addr_in[ 1]) statement enables event-driven behavior, causing the cmd_addr_timing_check( 8) routine to be invoked every time the specific bit of addr_in flips value. The function cmd_addr_timing_check( 8) performs the actual timing check, where '8' presumably refers to a timing constraint threshold or a specific address line to be monitored.
