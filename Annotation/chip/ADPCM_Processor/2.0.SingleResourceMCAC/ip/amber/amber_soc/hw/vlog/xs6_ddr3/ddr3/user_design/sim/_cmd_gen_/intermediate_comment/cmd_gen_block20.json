    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating the command clock enable signal on the rising edge of the input clock. Specifically, it implements a flip-flop that on each rising edge of `clk_i` captures the state of `cmd_clk_en` after a delay specified by `#TCQ`, and assigns it to `cmd_clk_en_r`. The purpose is to synchronize the `cmd_clk_en` signal to the clock domain determined by `clk_i` with a specific delay, often used to meet setup and hold times."
