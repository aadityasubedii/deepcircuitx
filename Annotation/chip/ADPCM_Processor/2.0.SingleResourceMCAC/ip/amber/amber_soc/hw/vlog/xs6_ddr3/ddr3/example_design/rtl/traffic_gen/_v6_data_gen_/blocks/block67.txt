This block of code is a part of a three-stage pipeline design in a digital system. On every positive edge of the clock signal (`clk_i`), this block captures the input `data_mode_i` into three register stages in sequence, namely `data_mode_rr_a`, `data_mode_rr_b`, `data_mode_rr_c`. The delay `#TCQ` represents the clock-to-q delay for the pipeline stages.
