This block of code initializes a string array, `cmd_addr_string`, with names that correspond to various command and address lines of a memory chip. At the onset of simulation or reset, the initial block assigns these constant strings to respective indices of `cmd_addr_string`. These include names of various memory control signals like Chip Select (CS_N), Row Address Strobe (RAS_N), Column Address Strobe (CAS_N), Write Enable (WE_N) and Bank Address (BA), followed by other address lines. This string array is likely utilized later in the code to provide descriptive identifiers for these signals during debug or testbench output logging.
