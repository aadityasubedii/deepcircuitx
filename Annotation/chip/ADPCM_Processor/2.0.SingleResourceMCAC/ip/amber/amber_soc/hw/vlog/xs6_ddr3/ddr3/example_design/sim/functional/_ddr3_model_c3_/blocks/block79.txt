This block of Verilog code is responsible for triggering a function whenever there is a change in the specific bit (bit 51) of the dq_in signal. To accomplish this, it uses an 'always' block that responds to changes in the dq_in[51] bit by calling the function dq_timing_check with the bit number as an argument.
