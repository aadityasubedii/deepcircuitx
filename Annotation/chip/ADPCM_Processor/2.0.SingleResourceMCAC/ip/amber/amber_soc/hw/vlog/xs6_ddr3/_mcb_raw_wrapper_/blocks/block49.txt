This block configures the memory interface generator with B64_B32_B32 configuration and manages read and write operations based on certain conditions. For the enabled port, it assigns command signals, clocking signals, status signals, and data signals to interface with the memory. If the user interface mode is "AXI", unimpeded write and read accesses are allowed; otherwise, the block checks whether the write/read buffers are full/empty to avoid overflow/underflow. It also combines two 32-bit read data into a 64-bit data for the read data bus and divides the 64-bit write data to two 32-bit data for the write data bus. The block also handles error and underflow conditions in write operations.
