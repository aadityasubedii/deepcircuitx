    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog RTL code is used to manage data readiness signals. Specifically, it outputs a data readiness signal (`data_rdy_o`) based on the value of an internal data state variable (`data_rdy`). This internal variable itself is set according to the assertion of the two signals (`cmp_valid` and `data_valid_i`), which likely represent the validity of a comparison operation and the existence of valid input data, respectively. The use of the bitwise AND operator (&) suggests that for the data to be considered ready (`data_rdy` to be `1`), both input data needs to be valid and the comparison operation has to be successful."
