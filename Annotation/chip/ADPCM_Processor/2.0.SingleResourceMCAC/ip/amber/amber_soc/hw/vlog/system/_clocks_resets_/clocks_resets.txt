Module-level comment: The `clocks_resets` module manages system clocks and resets primarily in an FPGA setup. It takes in board reset, board clock negative, board clock positive, and DDR calibration done signals. It outputs system reset, system clock, and a specialized 200 MHz clock. Functionality is achieved with various internal signals for synchronization and phase-locked loop state management. The module structure adapts to different FPGA types, employing a behavioural model for non-XILINX FPGAs. The module ensures synchronized and streamlined system operation.
