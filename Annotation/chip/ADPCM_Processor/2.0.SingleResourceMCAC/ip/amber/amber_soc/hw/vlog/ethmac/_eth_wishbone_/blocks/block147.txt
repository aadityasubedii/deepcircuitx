Comment: 
This block of code implements a controller for the Ready signal of a transmit buffer descriptor in an Ethernet MAC subsystem. On a rising edge of the write buffer clock or a system reset, the controller behaves differently. If the system reset is asserted, it clears the Ready signal. On the other hand, if both 'TxEn' and 'TxEn_q' signals are active, and the read of transmit buffer descriptor is enabled ('TxBDRead'), then it assigns the Ready signal based on the condition whether 16th through 31st bit of 'ram_do' data is greater than 4 and the state of the 15th bit of 'ram_do'. If 'ResetTxBDReady' is set, it again clears the Ready signal.
