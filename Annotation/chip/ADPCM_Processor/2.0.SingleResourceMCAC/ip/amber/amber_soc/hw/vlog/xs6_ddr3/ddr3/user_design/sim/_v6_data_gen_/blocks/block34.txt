The block generates a specific data pattern for 88 Data Query (DQ) Pins. The conditions for data pattern generation are identified based on the value of NUM_DQ_PINS and the string matched in DATA_PATTERN. If NUM_DQ_PINS is 88 and DATA_PATTERN is either "DGEN_NEIGHBOR", "DGEN_WALKING1", "DGEN_WALKING0" or "DGEN_ALL", the conditional block titled WALKING_ONE_88_PATTERN is triggered. The contained always block then generates the desired pattern on the positive edge of the input clock.
