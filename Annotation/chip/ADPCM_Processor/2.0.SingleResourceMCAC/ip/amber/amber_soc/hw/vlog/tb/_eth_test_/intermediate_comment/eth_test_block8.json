    "block_comment": "This Verilog block controls the enable signal based on the current state of the system. If the system is currently not in the `CRC0` state, the enable signal is turned on. The block achieves this by using the `assign` keyword to immediately set the `enable` variable equal to the result of the comparison `state_r != CRC0`. As a result of this operation, the enable signal will be active during all states except `CRC0`."
