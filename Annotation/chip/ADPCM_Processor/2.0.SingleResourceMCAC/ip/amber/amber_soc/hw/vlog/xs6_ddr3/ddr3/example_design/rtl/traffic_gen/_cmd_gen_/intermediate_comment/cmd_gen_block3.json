    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to monitor the output burst length (bl_out) in a Virtex6 family FPGA design. It checks if the bl_out is greater than 2 and whether the FPGA belongs to the 'VIRTEX6' family. If both conditions are met, it displays an error message and halts the simulation execution."
