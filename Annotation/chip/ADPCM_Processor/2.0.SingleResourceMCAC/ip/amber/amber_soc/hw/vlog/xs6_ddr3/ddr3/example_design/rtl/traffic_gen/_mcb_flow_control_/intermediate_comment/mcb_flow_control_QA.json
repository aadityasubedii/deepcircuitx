It designates the next state according to the current state, whether the input signals are ready or not, and the commands given. It uses a finite state machine approach to switch between states such as \"READY\", \"READ\", \"WRITE\", \"CMD_WAIT\", and \"REFRESH_ST\". The module uses registers to temporarily hold the command, address, and burst length information, before providing it as an output. It also has the ability to handle different commands like read, write, refresh or others.\n"
