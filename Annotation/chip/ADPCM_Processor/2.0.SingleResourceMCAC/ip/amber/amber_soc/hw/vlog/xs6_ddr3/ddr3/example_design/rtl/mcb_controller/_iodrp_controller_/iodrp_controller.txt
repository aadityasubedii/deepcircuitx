Module-level comment: The 'iodrp_controller' module manages an IO Distributed RAM-Programmable (DRP) by handling Read/Write operations to the memory cells and governing states via a Finite State Machine (FSM). It employs inputs for data, instructions, and synchronization, with internal signals assisting in state transitions, bit shifting, and debugging. Outputs communicate operational state, data read, and broadcast usage. This system assures efficient memory cell management and seamless state transitions, encapsulating a nifty state-machine controller design.
