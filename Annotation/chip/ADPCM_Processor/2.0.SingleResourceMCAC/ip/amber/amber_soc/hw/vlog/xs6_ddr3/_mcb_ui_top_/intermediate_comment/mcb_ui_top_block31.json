    "block_comment": "The block of code implements a function that converts the arbitration slot of ports based on the provided port configuration. It starts by setting a mapping corresponding to the port configuration through a case statement. It then counts the number of enabled ports by iterating over the port_status bits. Based on the number of active ports, it alters the arb_slot value selectively. For the active ports, the arbitrary slot value is transformed according to the port map. For the inactive ports, it assigns a default value of 3'b111 to the arbitrary slot."
