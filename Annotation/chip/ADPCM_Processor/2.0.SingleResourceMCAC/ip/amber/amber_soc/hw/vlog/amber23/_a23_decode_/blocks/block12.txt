This block of code handles status bits' next-state assignment under specific control states in a state machine. When the control state equals to "INT_WAIT1", the current state information denoted by 'status_bits_mode_r' is kept constant and assigned to the next state indicator 'status_bits_mode_nxt' preserving the status for upcoming operations. The code is straightforward and implements a conditional next state decision based on the present state of control.
