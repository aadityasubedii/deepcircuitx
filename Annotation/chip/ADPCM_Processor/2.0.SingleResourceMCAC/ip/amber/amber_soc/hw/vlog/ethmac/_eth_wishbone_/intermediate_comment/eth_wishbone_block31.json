    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for synchronizing the signal 'ShiftEndedSync'. The synchronization happens based on either a positive edge of the Wishbone clock 'WB_CLK_I' or a positive edge of 'Reset'. If 'Reset' is high, 'ShiftEndedSync2' is immediately set to '0'. Elsewhere, the value of 'ShiftEndedSync2' is updated with the value of 'ShiftEndedSync1' after a specified propagation delay ('Tp')."
