    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of an internal system reset signal (`c3_sys_rst_i`). It performs in two ways depending on the condition of constant `C3_RST_ACT_LOW`. If this constant is true, `c3_sys_rst_i` takes the value of `c3_sys_rst`, otherwise, it takes the inverted value of `c3_sys_rst`."
