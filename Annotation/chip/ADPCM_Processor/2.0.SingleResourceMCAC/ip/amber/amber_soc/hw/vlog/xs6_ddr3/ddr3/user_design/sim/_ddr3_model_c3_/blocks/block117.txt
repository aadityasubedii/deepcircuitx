This block triggers a timing check function for the 14th bit in the `dq_in` array whenever there's a change in its value. It is implemented using an 'always' block in Verilog that monitors changes in the target bit, and when a change is detected, it calls the 'dq_timing_check' function with '13' as the argument, indicating it's checking the timing for the 14th bit (as indexing starts from 0).
