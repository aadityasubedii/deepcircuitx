This block of code manages state transitions in the design. Depending on a certain condition, the system state changes either to a waiting state (specifically, LDQS_CLK_P_TERM_WAIT), or it transitions to another state, LDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM. Thus, the block controls the design's state machine by updating the current state based on specific conditions.
