    "block_comment": "The provided block of code is responsible for managing the address phase of a DRP (Dynamically Reconfigurable Processor) operation. On every positive edge of the DRP clock, it checks for a synchronous reset signal. If the reset is active, it resets the AddressPhase variable to false. When the reset is not active, the block decides the state of the AddressPhase based on its existing state, the state of the process, and a bit counter. If the AddressPhase is true, it stays true unless the process is almost ready to proceed to its next phase. If the AddressPhase is false, it turns true when the process transitions into the address phase and the bit counter reaches its maximum value."
