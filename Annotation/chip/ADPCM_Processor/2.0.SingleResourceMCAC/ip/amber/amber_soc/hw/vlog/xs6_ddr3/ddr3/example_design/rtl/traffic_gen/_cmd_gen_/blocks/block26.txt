The block of code performs decision-making based on address comparison with an end address. It compares the most significant byte, the second most significant byte, and the third most significant byte of 'addr_out' with corresponding bytes of 'end_addr_r'. If 'addr_out' is larger or equal to 'end_addr_r' for a given byte, it sets the respective 'AC' flag to 1 with a delay defined by 'TCQ', otherwise, it sets the respective 'AC' flag to 0.
