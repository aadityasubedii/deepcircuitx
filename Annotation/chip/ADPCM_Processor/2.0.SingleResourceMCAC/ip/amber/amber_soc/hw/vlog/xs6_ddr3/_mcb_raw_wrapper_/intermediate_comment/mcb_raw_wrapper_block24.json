    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code configures an OSERDES2 block for operation as a 2:1 serializer. It sets various properties of the OSERDES2 like the clock bypass, data rates, output mode, and SERDES mode. Defined in the instantiation are multiple clock, data, and control signals. The functionality of the block is achieved by input clocks ioclk0 and internal system reset (int_sys_rst). Data inputs D1 and D2 are handling ras_90 signal. The outputs are ioi_ras and t_ras, which respectively correspond to the serialized data output OQ and 3-state output TQ. Unused pins are tied off to '0' or '1' as appropriate. The I/O clock enable (IOCE) is connected to pll_ce_0, while the output clock enable (OCE) is permanently enabled with '1'."
