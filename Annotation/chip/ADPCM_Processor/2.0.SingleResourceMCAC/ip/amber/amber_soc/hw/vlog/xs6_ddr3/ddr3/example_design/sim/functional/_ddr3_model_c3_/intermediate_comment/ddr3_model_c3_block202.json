    "block_comment": "This block of code is to manage the data reception based on the rising edge of the dqs_even signal. Specifically, the block defines the behavior of data reception on the 6th pin of the dqs_even signal. It uses an \"always\" block which acts on the positive edge of the dqs_even[6], ensuring that the 'dqs_even_receiver' function is called upon each rising edge of the dqs_even[6]. This supports consistently updated data reception, managed through the 'dqs_even_receiver' function."
