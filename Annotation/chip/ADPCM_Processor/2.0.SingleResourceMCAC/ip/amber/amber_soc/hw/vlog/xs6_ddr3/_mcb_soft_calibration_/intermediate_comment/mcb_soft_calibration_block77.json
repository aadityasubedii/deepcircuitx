    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is essentially a counter timer that provides a 200us delay. It operates by incrementing a count on every positive edge of the user interface (UI) clock, unless a reset (RST) is issued. Upon a reset, the initial counter value is set based on the simulation state. If in simulation, it is given a large starting value (7FF0 in hexadecimal), presumably to speed up simulation time, otherwise it starts from zero. As long as the most significant bit (15th bit) of the counter is not set, the counter continues to increment, effectively creating the 200us delay."
