    "block_comment": "The block is designed for handling Co-Processor (Co-Pro) read and write operations in a system with cache control. Asynchronously on a positive edge clock trigger, and with no fetch stall condition, the block categorizes operations into writes and reads. For write operations, specific actions are performed based on the i_copro_crn values, outputting debug messages based on the related operation like flush cache, cache control, and others. Similarly, for read operations, based on the copro_crn_d1 values, it performs read from specific register operations and provides debug messages consequently. The registers include the ID Register, Cache control, and Fault Status Register, among others."
