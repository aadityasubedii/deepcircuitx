Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls multiple signal assignments in a synchronous DRP_CLK clock domain. On each positive edge of the DRP_CLK clock signal, several registers are updated. `DRP_ADD` and `DRP_CS` are set depending on whether the next state is `ADDR_PHASE` or `DATA_PHASE`. `MCB_UIREAD` is updated to the logical AND of the next state being `DATA_PHASE` and `rd_not_write_reg` being true. Finally, if the current state is `READY`, `DRP_BKST` is set to the value of `use_broadcast`. The block thus implements a part of a Finite State Machine (FSM) helping to organize different phases of address and data transmission.
