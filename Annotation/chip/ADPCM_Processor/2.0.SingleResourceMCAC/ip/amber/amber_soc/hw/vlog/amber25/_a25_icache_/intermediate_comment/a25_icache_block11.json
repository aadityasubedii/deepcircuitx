    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning appropriate state names to the variable `xC_STATE` based on the current state of `c_state`. It employs a chain of ternary operators to simultaneously check the multiple potential states of `c_state` and assign the corresponding state string to `xC_STATE`. If `c_state` doesn't match any of the given enums, it defaults to \"UNKNOWN\". This assignment ensures a human-readable form of the current state for potential debugging or reporting purposes."
