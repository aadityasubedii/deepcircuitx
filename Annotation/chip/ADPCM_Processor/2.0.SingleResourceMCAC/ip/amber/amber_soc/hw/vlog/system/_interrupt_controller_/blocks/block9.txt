This block of code is responsible for a synchronous update of the 'wb_start_read' signal. The operation happens at the positive edge of 'i_clk', meaning whenever 'i_clk' changes from a low signal level ('0') to a high signal level ('1'). The 'wb_start_read' signal is stored in 'wb_start_read_d1' until the next positive edge of 'i_clk' comes around. Utilizing this delay model, the circuit guarantees the stability of 'wb_start_read' signal for a clocking period.
