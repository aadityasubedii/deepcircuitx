    "block_comment": "This block assigns values to variables governing control and command if Port 4 is enabled (C_PORT_ENABLE[4] == 1'b1). Specifically, variables covering arbiter enable, command clock, command enable, row and bank address, column address, command instruction, block length, and the read and write statuses of the fourth command all receive values from a set of defined command variables. When Port 4 is not enabled, these variables are all assigned to zero, indicating functionality is disabled."
