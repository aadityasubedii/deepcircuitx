    "block_comment": "The code block assigns values to two output variables, `o_pc` and `o_rm`, based on the internal register values. `o_pc` is directly assigned from the value of `r15_out_rn`. The value of `o_rm` is determined by a multiple-selection case structure. The input selector `i_rm_sel` is used to choose which internal register (`r0_out` through `r15_out_rm`) output should be assigned to `o_rm`. This block effectively implements a register file read operation, allowing selective reading of a set of internal registers."
