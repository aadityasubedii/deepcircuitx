    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a timing check function on the 20th bit of the data input `dq_in`. The function `dq_timing_check` is triggered on any change in the 20th bit (`dq_in[19]`) of the `dq_in` data array. To manage the timing and carry state changes of this specific bit in the full pipeline, Verilog's sensitivity list construct (`always @`) is used."
