    "block_comment": "This function generates register addresses based on the mode and selection inputs. By executing a casez statement on the mode and sel inputs, the function flexibly assigns specs to the 5-bit reg_addr output. Each case statement handles a unique combination of mode and selection values, and produces different address alignment configurations for the register."
