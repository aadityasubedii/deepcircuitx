Comment: 
The block assigns an intermediate hash value based on the result of a hash function. This selection between hash values is dependent on the 6th bit of the `CrcHash` value. If the 6th bit of `CrcHash` is 1, `IntHash` is assigned the value of `HASH1`; otherwise, it is assigned the value of `HASH0`.
