    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for event-driven signal receiving in synchronous digital design. The always block is executed whenever a positive edge event occurs on the 'dqs_odd[ 1]' signal, calling the 'dqs_odd_receiver' function with an input of '1'. As a typical use of the always block, this operation facilitates real-time response to signal changes, ensuring that the 'dqs_odd_receiver' function is applied precisely when signal 'dqs_odd[ 1]' undergoes a positive edge transition."
