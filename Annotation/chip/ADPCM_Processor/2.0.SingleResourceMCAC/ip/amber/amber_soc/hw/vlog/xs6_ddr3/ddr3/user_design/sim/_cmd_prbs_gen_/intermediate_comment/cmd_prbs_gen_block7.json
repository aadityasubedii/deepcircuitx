    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is purposed for conditional instantiation based on command and width in data generation process. The generate statement combined with the \"if\" condition are utilized for compile-time configuration, specifically when the command (\"PRBS_CMD\") is \"ADDRESS\" and the data width (\"PRBS_WIDTH\") is 32. This block starts an unnamed, labeled generate block (\"gen32_taps\") under these conditions."
