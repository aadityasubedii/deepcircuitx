Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for updating the WriteRxDataToFifoSync2 signal based on a rising edge of WB_CLK_I or a rising edge of Reset. The block conditionally updates WriteRxDataToFifoSync2 depending on the state of Reset: if Reset is high, WriteRxDataToFifoSync2 is set to zero, otherwise, it takes the value of WriteRxDataToFifoSync1. This is achieved using a clock or reset-triggered always block, introducing a delay 'Tp' to mimic the propagation delay present in practical hardware setups.
