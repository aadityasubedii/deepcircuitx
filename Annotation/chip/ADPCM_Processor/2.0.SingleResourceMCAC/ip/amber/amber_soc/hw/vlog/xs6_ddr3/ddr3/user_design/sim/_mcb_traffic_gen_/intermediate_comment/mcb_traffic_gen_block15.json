    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the `cmd_full` signal the value of `mcb_cmd_full_i`. It acts as a conduit, relaying the status of the Memory Controller Buffer (MCB). The status indicates whether the MCB command queue is full. When `mcb_cmd_full_i` returns true, it implies the MCB command queue has no room for more commands."
