Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code assigns the value of `addr_counts` to `seq_addr`. This statement essentially means that the sequential circuit's address is determined by the count value in `addr_counts`. The assignment operation is achieved using the `assign` keyword, which declares a continuous assignment that constantly applies the value of the right-hand expression `addr_counts` to the left-hand net `seq_addr`. This operation assures that every change in `addr_counts` is instantaneously reflected in `seq_addr`.
