It determines the current state of the memory cell and alters it based on the command inputs received. The module also provides shift-through registers, command validation, and load shifting operations to manage the memory cell state. Additionally, this module appears to handle data exchanges between different phases, such as the address phase and the data phase, and provides several local parameters for different states. The main operation of the module is regulated by a Finite State Machine (FSM)."

DRP_CLK: This is the clock input for the DRP Controller.\n\n8. DRP_SDO: The serial output data from the memory cell, after reading.\n\nOutput Ports:\n\n1. read_data [7:0]: This port outputs the data read from the addressed memory cell.\n\n2. rdy_busy_n: The Ready/Busy indicator, high when the controller is ready to accept a new command, and low when it is busy.\n\n3. DRP_CS: The Chip Select signal. When high, the memory cell is selected and ready for operations.\n\n4. DRP_SDI: The Serial Data In which gets the bits to be written to the memory cell.\n\n5. DRP_ADD: This is an Address Phase flag. When high, it indicates that controller is in the address phase.\n\n6. DRP_BKST: It gets high when the broadcast is used, i.e., when the same data needs to be written to several memory cells."
