    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is primarily used to decode the execution type of an instruction fetched from `execute_instruction`. The behavior achieved is through use of a conditional concatenation and comparison operation (using `assign` keyword). The operand `execute_instruction`'s different bits are sliced, concatenated and then matched against specific bit-patterns. Depending on the matching pattern, the output `itype` is assigned a specific execution type such as `SWAP`, `MULT`, `REGOP`, `TRANS`, `MTRANS`, `BRANCH`, `CODTRANS`, `COREGOP`, `CORTRANS`, and `SWI`."
