    "block_comment": "This block handles resetting and mode selection in a Verilog system. On a positive edge of the clock input, if a reset signal is detected, two variables `data_mode_sel` and `addr_mode_sel` are assigned with predefined constants: `DATA_MODE` and `2'b11`, effectively setting them to certain modes. If a reset signal is not detected but a modify enable signal `vio_modify_enable` is active, these same variables are assigned with corresponding varying values from `syn1_vio_data_mode_value[2:0]` and `vio_addr_mode_value`. Thus, the block configures mode selection based on the reset and modify enable signals."
