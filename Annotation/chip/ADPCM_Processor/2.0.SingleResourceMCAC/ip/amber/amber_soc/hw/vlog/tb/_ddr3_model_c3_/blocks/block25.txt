Comment: 
This block of code triggers a negative-edge timing check for the 8th (index 7) bit of the "`dqs_in`" signal. The implementation is an 'always' block that is sensitive to the falling edge of bit 7 of signal "`dqs_in`" (expressed as "`negedge dqs_in[ 7]`") which upon detection, calls the function "`dqs_neg_timing_check`" with parameter '7' (which probably corresponds to the bit position of 7).
