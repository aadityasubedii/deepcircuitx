    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles conditional toggling of the `RxEn_needed` signal based on various input conditions, with sensitivity to both positive edge of `WB_CLK_I` and `Reset`. Upon a reset signal, `RxEn_needed` is set to 0. In the absence of a reset signal, when `RxReady` is not asserted and `r_RxEn`, `WbEn` are asserted but `WbEn_q` is not, `RxEn_needed` is set to 1 indicating initiation of receive-enablement. However, when `RxPointerRead`, `RxEn` and `RxEn_q` are all asserted, `RxEn_needed` is reset to 0 indicating an end to or halt of receive-enablement."
