    "block_comment": "This block of code defines an instantiation of an OSERDES2 module named ioi_we_0, and it is used for serializing parallel data into a more compact high-speed output. This block routes the parallel data we_90 into the data lines D1 and D2 of the serializer, then uses the ioclk0 clock signal to control the rate of serialization. The serialization rate and output mode are determined by the constants C_OSERDES2_DATA_RATE_OQ, C_OSERDES2_DATA_RATE_OT, and C_OSERDES2_OUTPUT_MODE_SE used in the parameterization of the module. The serialized data is outputted on the ioi_we port and t_we port. This block also allows for manual control of reset, creation enable, and data rate through the int_sys_rst, pll_ce_0, and the selectively parameterization respectively."
