    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for handling the states of two masters (M1 and M2) in relation to two slaves (S1 and S2) using the Wishbone standard. At system reset, all control and data signals for both slaves and both operational flags are cleared. During regular cycles, based on the states of both masters, various signals are set or reset to control data transfer. These states include whether a master is idle, making a request, or has finished access. If a request is underway, it checks which slave is addressed and issues the necessary controls for data transfer. Furthermore, it heals system undefined addresses by displaying appropriate error messages. At the end of a master's access, signals are retracted for a clean exit."
