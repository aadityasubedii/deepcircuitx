This Verilog code block defines a function named `Mult_Divide` which performs the operation of repeated addition (multiplication) followed by division on an 8-bit input. Initially, the 16-bit `Result` register is set to zero. An 8-bit `Mult` parameter dictates the number of times the loop, that adds the `Input` value to `Result`, will execute. This effectively multiplies the `Input` value by `Mult`. Once the loop finishes, the `Result` is divided by the 8-bit `Div` value. The final result, which is also the return value of this function, is the least significant 8-bits of the `Result` register.
