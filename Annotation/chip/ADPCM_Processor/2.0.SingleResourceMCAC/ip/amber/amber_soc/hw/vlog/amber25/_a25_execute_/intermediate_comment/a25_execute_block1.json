    "block_comment": "The block defines two wire variables, 'xCONDITION' and 'xMODE', and assigns string values to them based on certain conditions. xCONDITION represents different possible conditions, and its value is assigned based on the input 'i_condition'. On the other hand, xMODE represents different operational modes, assigned depending on the 'status_bits_mode'. Both use a conditional operator (?:) to select an assignment. If none of the conditions match, xCONDITION defaults to \"NV \" and xMODE to \"XXX\"."
