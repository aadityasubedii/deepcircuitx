    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code involves two states, namely DONE and default, in a state machine. In the DONE state, the Pre_SYSRST and MCB_UICMDEN are both reset to zero, and the STATE variable is set to DONE. In the default case, the MCB_UICMDEN and Pre_SYSRST are reset while MCB_UIDONECAL is set to one."
