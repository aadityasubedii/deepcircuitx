    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog RTL code functions as a flip-flop, where it captures the state of the 'ck_in' input on the rising edge and assigns it to 'diff_ck'. The implementation uses an always statement with 'posedge ck_in' condition, meaning it responds to every positive edge or upward transition of the 'ck_in' clock signal, which is a common technique in edge-triggered flip-flops. Hence, the state of 'ck_in' at each rising edge is held in 'diff_ck'."
