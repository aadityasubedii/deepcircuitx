Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for capturing the 'mode_load_pulse' signal at the rising edge of the clock (clk_i). The capture of the signal is delayed by the value of the time constant #TCQ, representing a fundamental timing delay. As the code is executed at every rising edge of the clock, it allows the design to sync with the clock and also introduces a delay before the signal 'mode_load_pulse' is assigned to 'mode_load_pulse_r1'.
