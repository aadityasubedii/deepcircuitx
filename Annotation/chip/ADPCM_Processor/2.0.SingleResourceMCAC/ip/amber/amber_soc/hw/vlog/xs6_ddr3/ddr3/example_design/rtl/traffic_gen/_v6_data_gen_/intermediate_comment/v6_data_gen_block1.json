    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS). The code utilizes a data pattern generator (module data_prbs_gen) to achieve this, which is instantiated only if the DATA_PATTERN is either \"DGEN_PRBS\" or \"DGEN_ALL\". The PRBS generator is parameterized with a width of 32 for both PRBS and SEED, and also utilizes the EYE_TEST parameter. Inputs include clock, reset, clock enable, first initialization seed for PRBS, initialization command, and subsequent PRBS seeds that are constructed from selected indices of input address. The output of this block is the generated PRBS data."
