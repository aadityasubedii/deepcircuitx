    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements an active-low, edge-triggered timing check on the 25th bit of the \"dqs_in\" input array. Whenever a falling edge (transition from high to low) is detected on \"dqs_in[24]\", the function \"dqs_pos_timing_check\" is called with the argument \"24\"."
