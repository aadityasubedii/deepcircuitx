Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for synchronizing the input signal 'data_mode_i' with the clock signal 'clk_i' and storing it in three different registers ('data_mode_r_a', 'data_mode_r_b', 'data_mode_r_c'). During the clock's rising edge, the new values of 'data_mode_i' are loaded into these registers with an intended delay specified by 'TCQ', ensuring that any changes in data_mode_i are accurately captured and transferred to these registers.
