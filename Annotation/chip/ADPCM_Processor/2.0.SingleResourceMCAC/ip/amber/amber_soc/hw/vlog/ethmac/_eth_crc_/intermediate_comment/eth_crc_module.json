    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe eth_crc module calculates a 32-bit CRC checksum, primarily for Ethernet frame error detection. It accepts a 4-bit input data, clock, reset, enable, and initialize signals. Output includes the computed CRC and CRC error flag. Computation is enabled/disabled by the enable signal, and the CRC register is set/reset by reset/initialize signals. Intermediate CRCs are calculated based on data and current CRC using XOR operations and assigned to internal wire CrcNext which is latched to the Crc register on clock edges unless reset/initialize is asserted. The final CRC is then compared with a predefined value to detect errors."
