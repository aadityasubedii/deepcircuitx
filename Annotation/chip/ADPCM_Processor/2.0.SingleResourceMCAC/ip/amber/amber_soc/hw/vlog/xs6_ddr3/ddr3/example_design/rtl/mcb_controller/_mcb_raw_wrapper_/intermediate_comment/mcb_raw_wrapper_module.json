    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper for DDR memory interfaces, supporting various memory types and configurations. It handles I/O and control signals for memory operations, utilizing IODRP2 for delay/calibration, OSERDES2 for output serialization, and IOBUF/OBUFT for physical I/O connections. The module manages multiple user ports, performs clock/reset management, and implements data path control and calibration, providing a flexible interface between user logic and DDR memory."
