    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a bistable latch which controls the state of BlockingTxBDRead under certain conditions. When there's a positive edge on WB_CLK_I or Reset, the code is triggered. If Reset is high, BlockingTxBDRead is set to 0. If this condition isn't met but StartTxBDRead is high, it sets BlockingTxBDRead to 1. Lastly, if neither Reset is high nor StartTxBDRead are high and TxBDReady is low, BlockingTxBDRead is set to 0. The '#Tp' indicates a delay in propagation."
