Comment: 
This block of code performs the task of swapping arguments in a register. It completes its function by first warming up the "reg_d" register, followed by writing a comma to the "decompile_file". It then warms up the "reg_m" register and writes another comma and an opening square bracket to the file. Finally, it warms up the "reg_n" register and writes a closing square bracket to the file. This series of operations make sure all registers are properly warmed up before they are operated upon and each operation is logged into "decompile_file" for debugging or audit purposes.
