    "block_comment": "The block controls the data_valid signal based on different conditions. When a positive edge of the clock signal is detected, it resets the data_valid signal if the 2nd bit of the reset input (rst_i[1]) is set. If not, it checks whether the command start (cmd_start) is true. If cmd_start is true, it sets the data_valid signal. If cmd_start is not true, it checks if the FIFO is not full and user_burst_cnt is less than or equals to 1. If this condition is met, it clears the data_valid signal. The TCQ delay models a flip-flop's clock to Q delay."
