    "block_comment": "This block of code is for a clock edge sensitive operation, specifically to the rising edge of signal `dqs_even[3]`. This operation calls the `dqs_even_receiver` function with the argument `3` whenever there's a positive edge in the `dqs_even[3]` signal. This mechanism ensures the stability and synchronization in the design, by reacting to signal changes only on specific clock edges."
