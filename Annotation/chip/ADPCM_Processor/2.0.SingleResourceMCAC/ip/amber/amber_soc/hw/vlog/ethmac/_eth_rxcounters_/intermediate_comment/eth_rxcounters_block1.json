    "block_comment": "The code block represents a synchronous counter, specifically designed for Delayed Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC) operation. On the rising edge of the `MRxClk` or `Reset`, if `Reset` is high, the 4-bit `DlyCrcCnt` counter gets cleared. Otherwise, if the `DlyCrcCnt` equals 9, it also gets reset to 0. If `DlyCrcEn` is enabled and `StateSFD` is true, the counter increments by only 1, else it's incremented only if `DlyCrcEn` is true and any bit of the current count is high. This implementation ensures counter increments happen only under specific conditions related to CRC operation."
