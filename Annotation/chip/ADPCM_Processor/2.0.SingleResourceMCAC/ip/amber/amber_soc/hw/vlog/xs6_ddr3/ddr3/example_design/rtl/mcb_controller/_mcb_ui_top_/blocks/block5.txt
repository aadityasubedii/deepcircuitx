This block of code is responsible for the control path of a user interface memory controller block (MCB) when the S5_AXI_ENABLE signal is inactive. The control signals for read, write, and command paths are conditionally assigned from their corresponding instances. Specifically, the block assigns the state of input/output signals for the command path, write path, and read path via direct signal assignments, governing the communication and operation flow in the MCB. Signals for enabling arbiters, clocks, operational enable, instruction byte address, data, status of buffers, and error signals are all assigned to help manage the interaction with the memory module.
