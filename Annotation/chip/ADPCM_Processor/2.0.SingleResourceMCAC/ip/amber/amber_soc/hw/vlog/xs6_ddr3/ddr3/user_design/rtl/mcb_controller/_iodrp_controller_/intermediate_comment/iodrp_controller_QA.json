It takes an address, a write data, and control signals as its inputs, and communicates with a possibly external memory or register. It implements a finite state machine (FSM) encoded in one-hot to navigate different states such as address phase, data phase, and a couple of intermediate waiting phases. This is typically used for serial access to a data object. The data to be read or written is sent out or received serially bit by bit with the aid of a clock signal. It also handles command validation, synchronous reset, and uses broadcasting if necessary."
