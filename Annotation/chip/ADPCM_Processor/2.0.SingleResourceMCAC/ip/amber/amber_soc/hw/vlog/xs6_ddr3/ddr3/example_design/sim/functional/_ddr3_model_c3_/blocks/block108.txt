The block of code is a testbench procedure in Verilog, which executes the function `dq_timing_check` whenever the 23rd bit of the `dq_in` data bus changes. The function `dq_timing_check` takes the index of the bit it should check, in this case, 22, and performs a timing check on the corresponding bit of the `dq_in` data bus.
