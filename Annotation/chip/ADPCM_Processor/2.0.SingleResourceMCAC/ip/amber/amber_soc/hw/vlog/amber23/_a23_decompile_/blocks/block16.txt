Comment: 
This Verilog task handles branch argument calculations for some form of an instruction execution. The task operates on a 32-bit shift amount, conditionally assigning it a value based on the 24 most significant bits (MSB) of the 'execute_instruction'. If the 24th MSB is set, it negates the 24 MSB of 'execute_instruction' and pads the least significant bits (LSB) with zeros. If unset, it simply uses the MSB value and pads the LSB with zeros. Depending on the same condition mentioned earlier, it either subtracts or adds the shifted amount from a fetched value from some register (presumably 'register 21') and writes the result to the 'decompile_file' file after converting it to hexadecimal.
