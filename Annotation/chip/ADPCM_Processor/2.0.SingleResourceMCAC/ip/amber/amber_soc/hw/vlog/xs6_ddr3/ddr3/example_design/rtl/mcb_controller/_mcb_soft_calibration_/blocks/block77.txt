The block handles system reset and the initialization stage of a related hardware component. The block is triggered on the rising edge of UI_CLK or RST. On RST, it deactivates any ongoing reset and clears the counter. Otherwise, it deactivates block reset and, if Pre_SYSRST is high, a user-defined counter value RST_CNT is loaded. If Pre_SYSRST is low, it checks RstCounter against a defined max limit. If less, it activates Block_Reset and increments the counter, aiding in achieving a time-defined sequential reset functionality.
