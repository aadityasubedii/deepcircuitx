This block conditionally sets interface signals for a module based on the AXI interface standard when C_S5_AXI_ENABLE is not asserted. The block directly assigns input signals to internal signals and internal signals to output signals for various functions like commanding, read and write activities. The assignments include enabling signals, clock signals, command details such as address, instruction and block length, status flags for checking the read/write queue status (empty, full) and details about data in read/write queues (read data, write data and mask, counter, error and underrun/overflow indications).
