This block operates mainly as a left shift logic (LSL) mask selector. Depending on the value of `lsl_selector`, it sets the `lsl_mask` accordingly. If `lsl_selector` matches `7'b1??` pattern, `lsl_mask` is assigned `33'h_1_0000_0000`; for `7'b01?`, it's `33'h_0_0000_0000`. Specific values such as `7'b001` and `7'b000` set `lsl_mask` to `{ 1'h_1, low_mask, 16'h_0000}` and `{17'h_1_ffff, low_mask}` respectively. The masked values represent different shift operations for subsequent data processing.
