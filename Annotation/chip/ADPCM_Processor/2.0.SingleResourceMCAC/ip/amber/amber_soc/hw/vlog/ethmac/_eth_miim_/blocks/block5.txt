Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles byte selection based on specific conditions. It uses bitwise operations and condition checking to decide on the value of each byte. First, the ByteSelect[0] checks if a process is in progress and if current bit is either at the start or midpoint depending on the status of NoPre flag. The ByteSelect[1] is assigned when the process is in progress and the BitCounter equals to 40 in decimal. ByteSelect[2] and ByteSelect[3] checks not only the process status and bit position (BitCounter equals to 48 and 56 respectively) but also if a write operation is underway.
