This block of code implements a simple delay model in a digital design. The block works by continuously monitoring the changes in the `cke` input signal. Whenever there's a change in the `cke` input, it assigns this new value to the `cke_in` after a delay defined by `BUS_DELAY`. This functionality emulates real-world physical delay experienced on bus lines in hardware systems.
