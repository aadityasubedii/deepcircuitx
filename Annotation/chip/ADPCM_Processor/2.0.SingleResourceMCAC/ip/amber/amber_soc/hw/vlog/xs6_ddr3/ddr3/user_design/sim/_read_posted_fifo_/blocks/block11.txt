This block of code handles the verification of available room in a FIFO data buffer. It operates with a clock signal, which indicates when the logic should check the capacity of the FIFO buffer. If the available room in the buffer is greater than or equal to `62`, then a signal `dfifo_has_enough_room` is set to `true`. This signal assures that enough room is available in the buffer. The signal `dfifo_has_enough_room_d1` is delayed for one clock cycle (`#TCQ`), forming a pipelining mechanism to secure the operation's proper functioning under system clock.
