    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block of code is used to initialize the system clock signal 'c3_sys_clk'. It sets the 'c3_sys_clk' to low (0) at the start of the simulation. It essentially defines the initial state of the clock signal to be low, and it is typically used in testbenches to initialize conditions before entering the main test sequence."
