Comment: 
The block of code takes care of executing the `dqs_even_receiver` function every time there's a positive edge detected on `dqs_even[14]`. This behaviour is accomplished by the `always` keyword, which in conjunction with the `@(posedge ...)` event control statement, forms a sensitivity list indicating the block should react to positive edge changes on `dqs_even[14]`.
