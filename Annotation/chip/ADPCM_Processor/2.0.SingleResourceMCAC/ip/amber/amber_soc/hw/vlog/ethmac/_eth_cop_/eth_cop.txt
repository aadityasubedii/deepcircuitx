Module-level Comment: The 'eth_cop' module manages data transactions between two master and two slave devices. It receives inputs like data, address, and control signals from the masters, processes them, and routes to the target slave. It also returns data and acknowledgement signals to the masters. Internally, the module uses flags to mark transactions in progress and intermediate variables to hold transaction data. Control logic defined in 'always' blocks handle the different transaction scenarios. Error conditions are checked and reported with debug information. The module essentially acts as an efficient arbitrator to ensure safe and reliable data transactions.
