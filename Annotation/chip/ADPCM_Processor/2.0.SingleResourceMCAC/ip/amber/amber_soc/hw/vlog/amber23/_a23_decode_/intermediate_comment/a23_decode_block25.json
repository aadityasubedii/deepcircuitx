    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the interrupt service routine (ISR) of an instruction execution flow if an interrupt doesn't match a specified type. The block is activated when both instruction_valid and interrupt flags are set and next_interrupt is not equal to 3'd6. When triggered, the current instruction is saved, and depending on the interrupt type (3'd4 or others), the component that is to be written to next (reg_write_sel_nxt) is chosen. Next, reg_bank_wsel_nxt, address_sel_nxt, and pc_sel_nxt are set to predefined values reflecting the interrupt handler's path. Further, mode bits are set as interrupt_mode and an irq masked flag is set. Finally, if the interrupt type matches 3'd2, an firq masked flag is also set."
