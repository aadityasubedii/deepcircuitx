    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a data generator, specifically for handling data mode operations and memory address selections. On a positive edge of the clock signal, if the 'fifo_rdy_i' signal is active or if a start command ('cmd_startC') is initiated, a selection process is engaged. Based on the specific address range (given by 'addr_i[7:3]'), different data processing operations are performed. If the data mode ('data_mode_i') is '4'b0101', data is generated via the 'Data_Gen' function with the address range as the argument. However, if the data mode is anything else, data is generated with the 'Data_GenW0' function. The generated data is then stored in 'w1data'. If an address range is not defined, 'w1data' is set to 0."
