Module name: a23_decompile. Module specification: This module is a decompiler for an ARM processor (likely Amber 23) designed for debugging and analysis purposes. It takes various inputs related to instruction execution and interrupt handling, and generates human-readable output describing the executed instructions and system events. The module has 11 input ports, including clock (i_clk), instruction-related signals (i_instruction, i_instruction_valid, i_instruction_undefined, i_instruction_execute, i_instruction_address), interrupt signals (i_interrupt, i_interrupt_state), and program counter signals (i_pc_sel, i_pc_wen). It has no output ports, instead writing execution information to a file. Internally, the module uses numerous signals for instruction decoding, including immediate values, register identifiers, opcodes, and instruction types. The module is structured into several main blocks: instruction decoding,
