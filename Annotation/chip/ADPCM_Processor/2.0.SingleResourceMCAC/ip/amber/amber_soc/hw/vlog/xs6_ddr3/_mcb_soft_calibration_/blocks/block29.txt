This block of Verilog RTL functions as a sequence controller for a memory controller buffer (MCB). It waits for the MCB to be ready before transitioning to the next state. This block achieves its function through conditional evaluation based on the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal. If the MCB is not ready, the state remains as LDQS_CLK_P_TERM_WAIT. When the MCB is ready, it transitions to the LDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM state, writing NTerm to the memory cell address and setting the operation mode to WRITE_MODE.
