    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs a ceiling, rounding up operation on a real number input. The implementation utilizes a condition check to test if the real number is greater than its integer representation, achieved through the \"$rtoi\" system function. If this test is true, it means the real number has decimal places; hence, it will increment the integer representation by 1 to round it up. If the test is false, the function simply returns the input number, indicating there was no need for rounding up as the number is already an integer."
