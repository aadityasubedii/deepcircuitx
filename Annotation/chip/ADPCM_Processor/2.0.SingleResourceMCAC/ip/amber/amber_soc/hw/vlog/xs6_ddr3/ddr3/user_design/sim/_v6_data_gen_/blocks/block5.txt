This block of code determines how to update `acounts` based upon the number of Data Queue(Pins) `NUM_DQ_PINS` and some other factors. If `cmd_startD` is true, `acounts` is immediately set to the input address `addr_i`. If `fifo_rdy_i` and `data_rdy_i` are true, and `MEM_BURST_LEN` is 8, the code updates `acounts` according to the value of `NUM_DQ_PINS`. The larger `NUM_DQ_PINS` is, the more `acounts` increments, changing in steps at `NUM_DQ_PINS`= 8, 16, 24, 32, 64 and 128. Changes to `acounts` are delayed by `#TCQ`.
