This block of code is responsible for handling the system clock input depending on its type (differential or single-ended). If the clock input is differential, which involves positive and negative signals, an IBUFGDS (Input Buffer for Differential Signals) module instance is created to handle the input. Differential termination is enabled using the DIFF_TERM parameter for the module. On the other hand, if the clock input type is single-ended, an IBUFG (Input Buffer) instance is created to handle the clock signal. In both cases, the clock signal is then buffered and outputted for use by other components.
