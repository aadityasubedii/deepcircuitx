This Verilog RTL block is responsible for generation of a Gray code representation for a given binary rd_ptr. The rd_ptr addresses are converted into Gray codes by using bitwise XOR operation in a sequential manner, where each bit n of rd_ptr is XORed with the next bit n+1, and the result is stored in respective bit n of rd_gray_nxt. The most significant bit of rd_gray_nxt is identical to that of rd_ptr. Thus, this block facilitates conversion of standard binary address code into Gray code to maintain unit-distance code during transitions.
