The block provided concerns a segment of a state machine that writes N termination data to a specific pin. Specifically, it sets the memory cell address to NTerm, the read/write bit to WRITE_MODE, and loads the write data with the N_Term_w value while asserting the command valid signal. The target is the I/O UDQS pin. Depending on the Ready/Busy signal status, the state machine either remains in the current state (UDQS_PIN_WRITE_N_TERM) or moves to the wait state (UDQS_PIN_N_TERM_WAIT).
