    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is an assignment operation where 'rst_tmp' gets a Boolean value. The functional purpose of this block is to control the reset condition of a specific system or subsystem based on the status of the PLL lock and self-refresh mode. The implementation uses logical conjunction ('&&') and logical negation ('~') operators. If the PLL (Phase Locked Loop) is not locked (represented by the negation of 'PLL_LOCK_R2') and the system is not in self-refresh mode (represented by the negation of 'SELFREFRESH_MODE'), then 'rst_tmp' will be TRUE (1), indicating a reset condition. Otherwise, 'rst_tmp' will be FALSE (0), meaning the system continues without a reset."
