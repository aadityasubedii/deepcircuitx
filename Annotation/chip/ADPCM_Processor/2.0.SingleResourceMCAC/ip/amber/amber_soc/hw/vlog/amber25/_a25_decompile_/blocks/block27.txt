This block is responsible for assigning an operation type (itype) based on the given execution instruction pattern. The execution instruction decoded specifies the operation as per the defined patterns using Verilog's conditional operator. Specifically, this block decodes the operation type as 'SWAP' if the instruction's specific bits (27:23, 21:20, 11:4) match the pattern '00010', '00', '00001001'. Otherwise, it checks for other similar patterns for different operations like 'MULT', 'REGOP', 'TRANS', 'MTRANS', 'BRANCH', 'CODTRANS', 'COREGOP', 'CORTRANS', and defaults to 'SWI' if no defined patterns match.
