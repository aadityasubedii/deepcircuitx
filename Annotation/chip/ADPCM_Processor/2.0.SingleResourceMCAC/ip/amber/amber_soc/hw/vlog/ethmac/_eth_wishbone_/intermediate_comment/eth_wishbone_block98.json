    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a transition detector for a transmit abort signal. It produces a pulse (TxAbortPulse) whenever TxAbort_wb signal transitions from low to high. This is achieved by logically AND'ing the current value of TxAbort_wb with the logical negation of its previous state, denoted by TxAbort_wb_q."
