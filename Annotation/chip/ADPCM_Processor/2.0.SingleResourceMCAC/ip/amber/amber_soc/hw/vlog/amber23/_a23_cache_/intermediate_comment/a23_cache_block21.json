    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating the valid bits of a cache memory and is activated on the rising edge of the clock signal when the cache state is in idle. To achieve this function, it concatenates the most significant bit (`TAG_WIDTH-1`) from each `tag_rdata_way` to generate the `valid_bits_r` register value. The `tag_rdata_way` data is likely representative of cache tags from different ways in a set-associative cache."
