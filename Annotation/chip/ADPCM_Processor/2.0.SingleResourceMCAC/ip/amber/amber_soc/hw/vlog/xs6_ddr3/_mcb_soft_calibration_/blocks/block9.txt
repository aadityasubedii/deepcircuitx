This block is responsible for controlling the shift in state based on the condition of the signal MCB_RDY_BUSY_N, managing the memory cell address assignment, and subsequently executing the negative edge delay. If the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal is high, it switches the state to UDQS_WRITE_POS_INDELAY; otherwise, it remains in the UDQS_WAIT1 state. In the state UDQS_WAIT1, if MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is low, it sustains the current state but switches to UDQS_WRITE_NEG_INDELAY otherwise. When transitioning to UDQS_WRITE_NEG_INDELAY, the block assigns a negative edge delay to the memory cell address via the variable NegEdgeInDly.
