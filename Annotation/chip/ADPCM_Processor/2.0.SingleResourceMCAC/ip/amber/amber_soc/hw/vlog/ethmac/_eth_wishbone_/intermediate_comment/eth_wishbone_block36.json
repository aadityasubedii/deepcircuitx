    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages a register, `SyncRxStartFrm_q`, that responds to the positive edge of `WB_CLK_I` (Write Back Clock signal) or a positive edge of `Reset`. Upon the arrival of a `Reset` signal, the register is asynchronously cleared by setting `SyncRxStartFrm_q` to zero. If a `Reset` signal is not detected, this block will capture the value of `SyncRxStartFrm` into `SyncRxStartFrm_q` at the rising edge of the `WB_CLK_I` signal."
