    "block_comment": "This block of code is employed for selecting the array index or 'way' for a cache memory system in a multi-way set associative cache design, in the case of an 8-way set. The function `pick_way()` takes two arguments - a register array `valid_bits_r` which maintains the validity of each 'way' in the cache and a random number `random_num`. The function selects and assigns the next 'way' or index (`next_way`) for cache access based on an input register array and random number."
