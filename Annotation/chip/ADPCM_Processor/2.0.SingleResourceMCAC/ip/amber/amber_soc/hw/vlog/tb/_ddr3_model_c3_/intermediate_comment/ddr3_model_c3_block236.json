    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for monitoring changes in 'dqs' or 'dqs_n' signals and delaying the incoming 'dqs' signals. It accomplishes this by using an always block triggered by either 'dqs' or 'dqs_n'. It then assigns 'dqs_in' to a 16-bit left-shifted version of 'dqs_n', bitwise OR-ed with 'dqs', after waiting for a period defined by '#BUS_DELAY'."
