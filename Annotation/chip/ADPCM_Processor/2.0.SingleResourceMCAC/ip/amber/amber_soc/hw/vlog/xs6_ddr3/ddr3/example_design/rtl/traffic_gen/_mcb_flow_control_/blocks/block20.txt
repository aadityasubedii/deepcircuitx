This block of code manages the update of signal readiness statuses on a clock's rising edge. It involves two commands `cmd_rdy_o` and `tst_cmd_rdy_o`, who's readiness states are updated with a time delay denoted by `#TCQ` following the input command readiness state `cmd_rdy` on every positive edge of the clock input `clk_i`.
