Comment: 
This block of code assigns a value to `current_slave` based on the address `master_adr`. It uses the conditional operator `? :` to select a value from one of eight possible slaves (`in_ethmac`, `in_boot_mem`, `in_main_mem`, `in_uart0`, `in_uart1`, `in_test`, `in_tm`, `in_ic`), each returning a 4-bit constant if the address matches. If no match is found, a default value of `4'd2` is assigned.
