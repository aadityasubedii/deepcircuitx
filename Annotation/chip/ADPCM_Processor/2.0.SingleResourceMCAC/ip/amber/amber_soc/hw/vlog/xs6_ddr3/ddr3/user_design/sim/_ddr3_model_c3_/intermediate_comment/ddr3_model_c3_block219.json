    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to set the latency values for read and write operations based on the additive latency (al) and predefined latencies (cas_latency and cas_write_latency). The implementation kicks off by checking if 'al' equals zero. When 'al' is indeed zero, no additional latency is considered. Otherwise, a calculated latency, which is the difference between 'cas_latency' and 'al', is used as the additive latency. Subsequently, the read and write latencies are calculated by adding the newly computed 'additive_latency' to 'cas_latency' and 'cas_write_latency' respectively."
