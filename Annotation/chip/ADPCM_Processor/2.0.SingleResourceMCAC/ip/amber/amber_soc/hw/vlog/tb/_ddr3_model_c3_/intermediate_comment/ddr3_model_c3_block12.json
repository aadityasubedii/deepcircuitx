    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions to constantly monitor the positive edge of the 21st element of the 'dqs_in' signal array. The signal change on the positive edge of 'dqs_in[20]' triggers the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function with the parameter '20'. The purpose of this always block is to enhance the timing check performance for signal 'dqs_in[20]' through the method mentioned above.\n"
