Comment: 
This block of code acts as a delay element for a clock enable signal 'cke' in a synchronous digital system. The module leverages the 'always' block and executes whenever there's any change in 'cke', effectively buffering the 'cke' signal with a delay specified by 'BUS_DELAY' parameter. The delayed value is then assigned to 'cke_in' signal which is a delayed version of the original 'cke' signal.
