    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a clock counter. When the system clock 'sys_clk' experiences a positive edge (i.e., transitions from low to high), the counter 'clk_count' increments by one. The `U_SYSTEM.sys_clk` is presumably a global clock signal used in the system, and `clk_count` is a signal used to keep track of the number of clock cycles that have occurred since the counter was last set or reset. The increment is performed using unary addition which is faster and more optimized for hardware implementations."
