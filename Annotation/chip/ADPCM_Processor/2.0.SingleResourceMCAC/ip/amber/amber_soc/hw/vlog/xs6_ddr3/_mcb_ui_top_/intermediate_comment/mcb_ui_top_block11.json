    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a synchronization signal for calibration completion in an AXI memory controller interface. It uses an instantiated module 'mcb_ui_top_synch' to achieve this synchronization. The module has a single bit width and takes the `s3_axi_aclk` as the clock signal. The input for the module is `uo_done_cal` which is an unsynchronized signal indicating the calibration completion. The output from the module is `calib_done_synch`, which is the synchronized version of the calibration completion signal."
