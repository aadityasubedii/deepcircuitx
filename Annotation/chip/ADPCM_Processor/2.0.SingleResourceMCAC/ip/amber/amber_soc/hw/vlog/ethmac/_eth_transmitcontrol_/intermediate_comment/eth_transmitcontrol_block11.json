    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the timing for control signals in a hardware design. Specifically, it regulates the control end signal (`ControlEnd`) and a transmission control start frame signal (`TxCtrlStartFrm`). The block is sensitive to the positive edge of the `MTxClk` signal, indicating that updates occur at each rising edge of this master transmit clock. Using the delay parameter `#Tp`, this code ensures that `ControlEnd_q` and `TxCtrlStartFrm_q` sequentially follow `ControlEnd` and `TxCtrlStartFrm` respectively after a duration equivalent to `#Tp`."
