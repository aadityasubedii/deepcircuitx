This block sets the FIXED_BL_VALUE based on the FAMILY and MEM_BURST_LEN variables. Utilizing conditional assignment, the block first examines whether FAMILY equals "VIRTEX6", and if MEM_BURST_LEN equals 8 or 0, setting FIXED_BL_VALUE to 2 if so. If not, for the same FAMILY value, it checks if MEM_BURST_LEN equals 4 and assigns value 1. In all the remaining cases, it assigns the existing value of FIXEDBL.
