Comment: 
The block of code enables a running traffic signal when there is a positive edge in the clock cycle. The system uses a flip-flop driven by input 'clk_i', which monitors the clock signal's positive edge. On every positive edge of 'clk_i', the previous value of 'run_traffic' gets latched to 'run_traffic_o', making it available to downstream logic until the next clock edge.
