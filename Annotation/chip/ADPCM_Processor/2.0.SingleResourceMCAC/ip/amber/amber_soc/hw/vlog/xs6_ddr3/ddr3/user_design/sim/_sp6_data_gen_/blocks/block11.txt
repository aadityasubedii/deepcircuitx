The block manages data loading into the 'w1data' based on different conditions. It primarily detects the rising edges of a clock signal to trigger the process. When a reset signal 'rst_i' is activated or certain conditions are fulfilled (i.e., 'fifo_rdy_i' and 'user_burst_cnt' are not zero or 'cmd_startC' is activated), it executes data assigning operations. If 'NUM_DQ_PINS' equals 16, 'w1data' receives particular values based on the fifth bit of 'addr_i'. This method separates 'w1data' into multiple groups, each receiving different bits from predefined constants like 'SHIFTB_0', 'SHIFTB_1', and so forth, or rearranging its bit order based on the data mode. If 'NUM_DQ_PINS' equals 8, 'w1data' sets bits based on the data mode or maintains its current value. In other cases, 'w1data' takes hex values directly, also based on the data mode.
