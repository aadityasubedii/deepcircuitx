    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is implementing XOR function. It's looping over every bit from two provided data inputs 'hdata' and 'w1data', and performing a bitwise XOR operation between corresponding bits. The result of each XOR operation is then stored in the same bit position within the output 'ndata'. This is done for all bits from 0 to DWIDTH-1."
