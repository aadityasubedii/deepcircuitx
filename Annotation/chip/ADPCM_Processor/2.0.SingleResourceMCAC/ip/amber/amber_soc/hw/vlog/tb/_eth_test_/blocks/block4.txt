Comment: 
The block of code acts as a finite state machine (FSM) for handling memory data operations. It operates on a positive edge of `mdc_i` input. Based on the current state (`md_state_r`), it either initializes counting (`MD_IDLE` state), transitions to start states (`MD_START0` and `MD_START1`), chooses read or write operation (`MD_READ0`, `MD_WRITE0`), builds physical and register addresses (`MD_PHYADDR`, `MD_REGADDR`), switches to turn states based on operation type (`MD_TURN0`, `MD_TURN1`), reads or writes data block (`MD_RDATA`, `MD_WDATA`), and updates memory operation in write transfer (`MD_WXFR`). In each state, the block tests certain input conditions (`md_io` or `md_op_r`) and modifies internal parameters (`md_count_r`,`md_state_r`,`md_op_r`,`md_phy_addr_r`,`md_reg_addr_r`,`md_rdata_r`,`md_wdata_r`). Each particular action depends on the current state of the FSM.
