    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for the implementation of memory controller soft calibration when a specific configuration variable, `C_CALIB_SOFT_IP`, is set to True. The module `mcb_soft_calibration_top` facilitates the calibration process, which includes a variety of operations such as Inferential termination calibration, dynamic calibration, and memory type selection, defined via the top module parameters. A myriad of inputs and outputs governs these operations, such as the user interface clock (`UI_CLK`), reset (`RST`), IO clock (`IOCLK`). Self-refresh requirements, MCB selection, user interface control, etc. are also managed within this block. The resultant module is conditionally compiled, which provides flexibility depending on the application-specific settings."
