    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the 'tag_wdata'. It uses a conditional operator to select between two values. If 'source_sel[C_FILL]' is true, 'tag_wdata' takes the value created by concatenating '1'd1' and bits of 'miss_address' from index 31 to 'TAG_ADDR32_LSB'. If 'source_sel[C_FILL]' is false, it assigns 'tag_wdata' to a value comprising of all zeros of width 'TAG_WIDTH'."
