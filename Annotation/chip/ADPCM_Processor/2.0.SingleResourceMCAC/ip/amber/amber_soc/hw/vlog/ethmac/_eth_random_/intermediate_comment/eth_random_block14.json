    "block_comment": "This one-line block in Verilog is used to calculate the feedback value for a linear-feedback shift register or similar logic modules. It does this by performing an XOR operation on the 3rd and 10th elements of the x array, and then returning the bitwise NOT result. This kind of operation is typically found in pseudo-random number generators or cyclic redundancy checks."
