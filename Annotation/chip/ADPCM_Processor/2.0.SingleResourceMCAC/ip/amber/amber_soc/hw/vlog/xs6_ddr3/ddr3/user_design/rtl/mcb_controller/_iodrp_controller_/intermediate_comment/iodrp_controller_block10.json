    "block_comment": "The block of code signals if the system is ready for operation. It specifically defines `rdy_busy_n` which reflects the operational state of the system. The signal gets assigned a boolean value based on the condition in the parentheses. If the current `state` of the system is `READY`, `rdy_busy_n` will be true, indicating that the system is not busy and ready for operation."
