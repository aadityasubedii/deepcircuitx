    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the initialization of a Memory Controller Block (MCB). On the positive edge of the input clock signal (clk_i), the value of the MCB initialization done signal (mcb_init_done_i) is transferred to the first MCB done register (mcb_init_done_reg1), and the value from this register is then handed over to the second MCB done register (mcb_init_done_reg)."
