    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog describes the configuration of a register, possibly a piece of a dual-port or single-port memory. The inputs and outputs for the register are defined. Constants are used for most of the control inputs, implying a steady state for the configurations like register enables, reset, clock signal for port B, write enables, etc. The address for port A is set by the input 'i_address' concatenated with 5 zeros, the write data comes from another signal 'i_write_data'. The write enable and read data signals for Port A are sliced from larger buses. There is no operation yet defined for ports B and any output data ports."
