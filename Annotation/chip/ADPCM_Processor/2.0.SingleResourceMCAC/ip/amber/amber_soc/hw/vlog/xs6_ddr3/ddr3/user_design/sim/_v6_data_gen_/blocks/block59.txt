This block is a conditional toggle switch that updates the 'sel_w1gen_logic' variable based on the state of the 'data_mode_rr_c'. It triggers on the rising edge of the input clock. It examines the 3 least significant bits of the 'data_mode_rr_c' variable, and if these bits equal to '101', '100', or '110', it sets 'sel_w1gen_logic' to '1' with a delay defined by the constant TCQ. Otherwise, 'sel_w1gen_logic' is set to '0' with the same delay.
