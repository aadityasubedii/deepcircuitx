This block manages transitions for the `TxPointerRead` variable in a transmitter control system. It operates synchronously to the `WB_CLK_I` clock signal or a high `Reset` signal. On reception of a positive edge of `Reset`, it sets `TxPointerRead` to zero. If reset isn't triggered and `StartTxPointerRead` is enabled, it sets `TxPointerRead` to one. If none of the previous conditions are met but `TxEn_q` is enabled, it again resets `TxPointerRead` to zero. This prioritization ensures controlled access to the `TxPointerRead` signal in different system states.
