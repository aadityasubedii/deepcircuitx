    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for writing data into a specific position in a 128-bit register based on the given address bits. This is achieved using Verilog's conditional ternary operator. The write data is selected based on the 2-bit values of the 4th and 3rd bits of the incoming address: if these are zero, the lower 32 bits are updated; for a value of one, the lower 64 bits are updated; for a value of two, the lower 96 bits are updated. If the 2-bit value does not match any of the defined conditions, the entire 128-bit register is updated with the incoming write data."
