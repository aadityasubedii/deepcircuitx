    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for receiving data through a Data Strobe (DQS) line when the 14th DQS edge is on the positive end. This is implemented using a sensitivity list that triggers the `dqs_even_receiver` function whenever there's a positive edge on the 14th DQS line (dqs_even[13]). The function call handles the receiving process. This simple yet effective mechanism ensures the controller stays in sync with the data flow."
