Comment: 
This block of code is primarily tasked with managing data input/output and memory control in a Verilog design. In terms of implementation, it first sets the write mode and associate data to appropriate registers, then sets the internal address for data transfer. The subsequent control flow ensures smooth transition between states based on the readiness of the Memory Control Block (MCB). If the MCB is ready, the system moves to writing mode; else, the system remains in a wait state.
