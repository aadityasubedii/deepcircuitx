Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for updating the LatchedTxLength variable based on several conditions. The block is sensitive to the rising edge of WB_CLK_I (Wallace Tree Multiplication Clock Input) or a positive edge Reset. If a Reset signal is detected, the 16-bit LatchedTxLength value is reset to zero, ensuring that the system is returned to its initial state. On the other hand, if the conditions of TxEn (Transmission Enable), TxEn_q (Transmission Enable queue), and TxBDRead (Transmission Buffer Descriptor Read) are met, the upper half (bits 31:16) of the ram_do (Random Access Memory Data Out) is latched to LatchedTxLength, capturing the length of the transmission data.
