    "block_comment": "The block of code performs a read buffer hit check. It uses bitwise-and operation to check whether the read buffer is currently valid (`read_buf_valid_r`) and if the upper 28 bits of the input address (`i_address[31:4]`) are equal to the stored read buffer address (`read_buf_addr_r[31:4]`). If both conditions are met, the result would be true, indicating a hit in the read buffer."
