Comment: 
This block resets or modifies dynamic synthesis tool protocol interface value. When a reset signal is raised, the data mode value and address mode value are set to predefined constants. If no reset signal is raised, but modification is enabled, the values are replaced with new data that comes from `vio_data_mode_value` and `vio_addr_mode_value`.
