    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs a multiplexer operation to determine the output data. By using a conditional operator, the block checks the value of 'addr_data_sel_n' signal. If 'addr_data_sel_n' is high, 'memcell_addr_reg', the content of a memory cell address register, is selected as the output data 'data_out_mux'. Otherwise, when 'addr_data_sel_n' is low, 'data_reg', the contents of a general-purpose data register, is selected to be 'data_out_mux'. The multiplexer operation is implemented using a conditional (ternary) operator in Verilog."
