    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code primarily functions as a positive-edge triggered flip-flop with an output state controlled by the `i_cmd_full` signal. When the `i_cmd_full` signal is deasserted or low, this flip-flop enables write requests, computes the write mask, and assigns write data. The `wr_en_r` signal gets the value of `write_request`, which can be utilized as an indicator for enabling write operations. The `o_wr_mask` signal is being set to the inverse of `wb_sel`, which can be interpreted as a mechanism to select which bits in a wider data bus to write to. Finally, the `o_wr_data` signal is loading the value of `wb_dat`, representing the actual data to be written."
