    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns input and output signals between different modules related to command, write, and read operations in a processor. Internally, it uses `assign` statements to bind various control and data signals to their respective internal signals. Specifically, it handles the enable signals, clock signals, command instructions, block lengths, and byte addresses. It also handles the status of command queues i.e whether they are empty or full. Similarly, for write operations, it manages write enable signal, mask, data, and the status of the write operation (including full, empty, and error flags). On read operation side, it controls read enable, clock, data, count, and the status flags (full, empty, and overflow)."
