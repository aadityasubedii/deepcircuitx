    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for receiving data strobes (dqs) at every positive edge of the 10th dqs_even signal. It operates by triggering the 'dqs_even_receiver' function whenever there's a positive edge on the 10th 'dqs_even' signal, implying a synchronous design where data is sampled or captured on the rising edge of the strobe signal."
