    "block_comment": "The provided block of code is a checking mechanism for a cache operation in a Verilog designed system. It triggers at the rising edge of a clock signal (i_clk) and checks whether the total of the values of data_hit_way[0] and data_hit_way[1] exceeds 1. If it does, an error message is printed displaying \"Hit in more than one cache ways!\" which indicates an inconsistency in the cache operation as a data block should not hit more than one cache way. This block ensures the correct mapping between data and cache ways."
