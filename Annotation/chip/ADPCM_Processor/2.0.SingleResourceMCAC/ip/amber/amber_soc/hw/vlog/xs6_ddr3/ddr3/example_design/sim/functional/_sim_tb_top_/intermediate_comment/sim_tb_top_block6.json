    "block_comment": "This line of code is assigning the signal 'c3_sys_clk' to 'c3_sys_clk_p'. Essentially, it is creating a replica of 'c3_sys_clk' signal named 'c3_sys_clk_p'. This could be done for a number of reasons such as providing another reference to the 'c3_sys_clk' signal or for creating a delayed version of it. The keyword 'assign' in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements. Here in the given statement, it means that any changes made to 'c3_sys_clk' will immediately reflect in 'c3_sys_clk_p'."
