    "block_comment": "The block generates an interrupt output using different interrupt requests and their respective interrupt masks. Each individual interrupt request (irq_txb, irq_txe, irq_rxb, irq_rxe, irq_busy, irq_txc, irq_rxc) is bitwise ANDed with their corresponding mask within the INT_MASKOut bit vector. The results are then combined using the bitwise OR operator to generate the final interrupt output (int_o)."
