    "block_comment": "This block of code denotes the initial configuration of a Block RAM (BRAM) in the Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA family using the block RAM primitive RAMB16BWER. The BRAM is initialized with predefined values (SRAM0_INIT_0 to SRAM0_INIT_63). The data width for both its input (dataA) and output (dataB) is set to 9 bits. The write mode policy is set to \"READ_FIRST\", which means the memory content is first read, updated and then written back. The parameters for \"DOA_REG\" and \"DOB_REG\" set to 0 signifies the outputs are not delayed by a clock cycle. The SRAM values ('SRVAL_A' and 'SRVAL_B') are set to zero, and the block is configured to not support synchronous reconfiguration ('EN_RSTRAM_A' and 'EN_RSTRAM_B' are \"FALSE\")."
