Module-level comment: The eth_rxethmac module is designed for receiving and processing Ethernet frames. Functionality includes frame reception, address checking, CRC computation, frame count, and handling various reception states. Inputs include clock signals, data, control signals, MAC address, and several control parameters. Outputs include received data, validity signals, frame count, CRC errors, and state indicators. Internally, the module contains several signal lines to control data flow and condition checks. It encapsulates blocks for state control, counters, address checks, and CRC calculations. Overall, it provides controlled, efficient reception and processing of Ethernet MAC frames.
