    "block_comment": "This block generates a continuous assignment of a wire named `cumlative_dq_lane_error_r` with the value of a register named `cumlative_dq_lane_error_reg`. This operation happens in real-time without a need for a clock signal. With this operation, `cumlative_dq_lane_error_r` replication of the `cumlative_dq_lane_error_reg` register gets ensured, echoing its current value throughout the duration of the simulation or hardware function. Thus, the block forms an interconnection linkage in the hardware design."
