    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the Reset and Abort conditions for a receiver operation in a data transfer protocol. It is triggered by either a rising edge of the MRxClk signal or a high state of the Reset signal. When the Reset is high, it forces RxAbort signal to a '0' ignoring anything else. If Reset isn't high, the code checks for abnormal receiver states characterized by invalid address (RxAddressInvalid), a byte count equal to 7 (ByteCntEq7) and enabled check (RxCheckEn). When these conditions meet, RxAbort is set to 1, otherwise, it remains at 0."
