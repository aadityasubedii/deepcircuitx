    "block_comment": "This line of code defines a continuous assignment for the wire 'buf_filled'. It calculates the difference between two pointers 'wr_capture_ptr' and 'rd_ptr'. The function of this block is to monitor the status of a buffer in a memory structure by displaying the amount of data it currently holds. This is achieved by subtracting the read pointer 'rd_ptr' from the write capture pointer 'wr_capture_ptr', which would result in the number of filled slots in the buffer."
