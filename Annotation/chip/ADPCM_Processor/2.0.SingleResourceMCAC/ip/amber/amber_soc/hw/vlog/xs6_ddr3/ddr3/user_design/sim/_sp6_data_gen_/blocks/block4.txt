Comment: 
This block of code performs a bitwise XOR operation between two inputs, 'hdata' and 'w1data'. The operation is done across all bits of the input signals, up to the 'DWIDTH - 1'. This is achieved through the use of a 'for' loop which iteratively XORs each corresponding bit of the input signals and stores the result in 'ndata'. The computation is triggered whenever either 'w1data' or 'hdata' changes their values.
