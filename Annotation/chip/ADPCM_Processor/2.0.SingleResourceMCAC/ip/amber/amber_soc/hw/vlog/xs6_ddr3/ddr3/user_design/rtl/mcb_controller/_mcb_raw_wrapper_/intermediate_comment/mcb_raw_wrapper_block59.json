    "block_comment": "This block of code functionally handles the memory interface signals for read operations in a specific operating mode, and defensively zeroes the signals otherwise. If the condition before this block is true, memory read signals like 'mig_p4_clk', 'mig_p4_rd_data', and 'mig_p4_en' are assigned values from their corresponding processer read signals ('p4_rd_clk', 'p4_rd_data', 'p4_rd_en' and others). If the condition is not met, these same signals are assigned a 'b0 value, essentially resetting them. Remaining signals related to write operations are also defensively set to 'b0."
