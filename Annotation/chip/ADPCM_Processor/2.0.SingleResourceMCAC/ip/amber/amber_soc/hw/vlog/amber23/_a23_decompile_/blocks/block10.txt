Comment: 
The 'wshift' task generates a shift operation based on the contents of the 'execute_instruction' and 'shift_imm' variables. The task checks the values of 'execute_instruction[6:5]' and 'shift_imm' to determine which shift operation to perform. It uses a case statement to match 'execute_instruction[6:5]' to its corresponding shift operation and writes the operation type to a 'decompile_file' along with the 'shift_imm' value. It handles special scenarios when 'execute_instruction[6:5]' equals 'LSL' or '2’d3' and 'shift_imm' equals '5’d0'.
