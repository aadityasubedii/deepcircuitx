    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for handling the operation of the Dynamically Reconfigurable Port (DRP) based on the current machine state. It is triggered on the positive edge of the DRP_CLK signal. When the machine state (`nextstate`) is in the address phase (ADDR_PHASE), it sets the DRP address (DRP_ADD) and chip select (DRP_CS) signals. Additionally, it sets the DRP_CS signal during the data phase (DATA_PHASE). When the machine state (`state`) is ready (READY), it uses a broadcast flag to set the DRP broadcast signal (DRP_BKST)."
