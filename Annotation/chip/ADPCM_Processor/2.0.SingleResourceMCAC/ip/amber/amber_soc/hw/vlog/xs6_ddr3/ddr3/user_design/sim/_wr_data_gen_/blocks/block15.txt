Comment: 
This Verilog code block is responsible for triggering multiple command starts based on the status of various command valid and ready signals. Upon every rising clock edge (posedge clk_i), each of the command start signals (cmd_start, cmd_startB, cmd_startC, etc.) is assigned the logical AND of corresponding command valid and ready signals, with a delay defined by the constant #TCQ. This implementation enables the start of different commands when they are both valid and ready, staggered by the delay #TCQ, ensuring synchronization with the clock
