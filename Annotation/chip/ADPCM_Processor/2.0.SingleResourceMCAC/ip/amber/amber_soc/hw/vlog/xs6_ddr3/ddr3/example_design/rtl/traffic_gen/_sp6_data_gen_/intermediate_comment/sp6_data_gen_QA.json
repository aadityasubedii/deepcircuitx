These patterns include fixed data, walking ones and zeros, sequential addresses, pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS), and a hammer pattern. The data generation can be configured for different data widths (DWIDTH) and different numbers of Data Query (DQ) pins. The generated data can be selected using a data mode input and it is outputted through the data_o signal. It features dynamic control and mode selection using various inputs like data_rdy_i, fifo_rdy_i, cmd_startA to cmd_startE."
