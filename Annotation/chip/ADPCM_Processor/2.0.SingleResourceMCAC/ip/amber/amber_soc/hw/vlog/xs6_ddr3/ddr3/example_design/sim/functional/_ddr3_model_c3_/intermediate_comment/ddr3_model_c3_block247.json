    "block_comment": "This block of code handles reset signal delay. It specifies that upon any changes to the 'reset_n' signal, a delay defined by 'BUS_DELAY' will be introduced before the updated signal is assigned to 'rst_n_in'. This is done using the non-blocking assignment operator ('<=') which schedules the update of 'rst_n_in' at the end of the current simulation time step."
