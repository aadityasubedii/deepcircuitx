Comment: 
This block is a modulo counter that indicates whether a reset condition has been met or not. The block operates at positive edges of the user interface clock (UI_CLK), and it performs a comparison between the value of the counter `RstCounter` and a predetermined maximum value `TZQINIT_MAXCNT`. If the `RstCounter` value equals or exceeds the threshold `TZQINIT_MAXCNT`, then the reset condition `Rst_condition1` is set to true (`1'b1`). Alternatively, if the `RstCounter` is still below the threshold, the `Rst_condition1` remains false (`1'b0`).
