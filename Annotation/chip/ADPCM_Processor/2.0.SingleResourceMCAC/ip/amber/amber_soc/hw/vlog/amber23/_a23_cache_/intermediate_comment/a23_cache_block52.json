    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for managing cache hits in a system that supports exclusive access. It primarily functions by resetting the cache hit result and associated way when the `ex_read_hit_clear` signal is high. However, if there's a read hit (`ex_read_hit` is high), a debug message is printed to indicate the memory address hit. The cache hit result `ex_read_hit_r` is set and the corresponding way is updated. If the cache state is in \"fill complete\" phase and there is an existing read hit, no particular action is performed; the if condition merely checks the system's state and recent read hit existence."
