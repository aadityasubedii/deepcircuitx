    "block_comment": "This block involves the computation of 'mtrans_num_registers', which is determined by the instruction's binary values. It specifically adds up the lower 16 bits, treating each bit as a separate four-bit number. The bits from instruction[15] to instruction[0] contribute to this computation, each padded with four '0's before addition. Hence, the 'mtrans_num_registers' totalizes the count of set bits in the lower 16 bits of the 'instruction'."
