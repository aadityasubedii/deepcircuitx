Module name: sim_tb_top. 

Module specification: The "sim_tb_top" module serves as a top-level simulation testbench for a DDR3 memory model, aimed at verifying the calibration and error handling of the memory interface signals. Being a testbench, it does not utilize any input or output ports, but generates all necessary signals internally and communicates with the module "example_top" (Design Under Test) using inter-module connections. 

Internal signals include the system clock (c3_sys_clk), system reset (c3_sys_rst, c3_sys_rst_i), DRAM interface signals like mcb3_dram_a, mcb3_dram_ba, mcb3_dram_ck, mcb3_dram_ck_n, mcb3_dram_dq, mcb3_dram_dqs, mcb3_dram_dqs_n, mcb3_dram_dm, mcb3_dram_ras_n, mcb3_dram_cas_n, mcb3_dram_we_n, mcb3_dram_cke, mcb3_dram_odt, mcb3_dram_reset_n, mcb3_dram_udqs, mcb3_dram_udqs_n, mcb3_dram_udm, and signals for calibration and error indication (calib_done, error), and impedance representation signal (rzq3). 

The module is mainly structured into multiple sections that handle different tasks. It begins with the declaration and initialization of parameters and signals. Then, it generates system clock and system reset signals, resets the system initially, and provides the inverted reset signal based on the parameter C3_RST_ACT_LOW. Following this, there is the instantiation of the “example_top” module with appropriate parameterization and connection of signals. The module also creates instances of 'ddr3_model_c3' depending upon the parameter C3_NUM_DQ_PINS. Lastly, it monitors the status of calibration and error signals. If the calibration finished successfully without any errors, it displays the message "TEST PASSED". If an error is detected, or if the calibration did not complete, the module reports a "TEST FAILED" message, specifying the cause of failure.
