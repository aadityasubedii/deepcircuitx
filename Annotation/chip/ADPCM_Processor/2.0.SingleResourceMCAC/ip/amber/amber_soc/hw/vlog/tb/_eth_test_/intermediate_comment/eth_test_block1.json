    "block_comment": "The function 'rmem' is designed to read data from two different memories based on the 'tx' signal. Specifically, if 'tx' is set, it selects and reads data from the 'mem' array at address 'addr+3'. If 'tx' is not set, it selects and reads data from 'rxm' array at the 'addr' index. Thus, it provides flexible memory management based on the 'tx' control signal."
