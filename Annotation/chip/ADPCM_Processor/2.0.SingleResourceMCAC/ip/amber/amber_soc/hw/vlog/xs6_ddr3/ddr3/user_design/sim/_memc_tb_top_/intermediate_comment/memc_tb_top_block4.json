    "block_comment": "This code block sets up the command field mapping when port 2 is enabled. If port 2 is set to read mode, it then assigns values from ports (0, 1, 3, 4, or 5) to variable instances of port 2, assuming those respective ports are enabled or match a particular mode. If no qualifying port is enabled, values are assigned from port 2 to port 2. When port 2 is not in read mode, all instances of port 2 variables are directly assigned from port 2."
