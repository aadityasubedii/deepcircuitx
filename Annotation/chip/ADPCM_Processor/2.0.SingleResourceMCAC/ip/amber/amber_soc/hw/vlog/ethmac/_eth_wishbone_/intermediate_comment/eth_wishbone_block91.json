    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the condition when there is a retry of transmission in a network interface. It works based on the event-driven programming paradigm and changes the value of `TxRetryPacket_NotCleared`. At a positive edge of signal `WB_CLK_I` or positive edge of `Reset`, the code block is executed. At reset, `TxRetryPacket_NotCleared` is initialized to zero. Then, if `StartTxBDRead` signal is high, `TxRetryPacket_NotCleared` is also set to zero. Finally, the block monitors for a retry condition (`TxRetry_wb` high) alongside various control signals, and the signal `TxRetryPacket_NotCleared` is set to 1 if the conditions are met indicating the presence of a transmission retry which hasn't been cleared."
