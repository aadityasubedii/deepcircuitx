It includes parameters such as clock period, reset active level, input clock type, and division factor for clocks. It takes system clock and reset signals as input and generates various clock signals and reset signals as output. The module also includes checks for differential and single-ended clock inputs and instantiates a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) that can create various clock signals like 2X, inverted 2X, and divided clocks. It further ensures the reset signals are synchronized to avoid any metastability issues. The output of the module includes various clock signals, reset signals, and a signal indicating if the PLL is locked."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: \n1. sys_clk_p: This is the positive phase of the differential input clock signal.\n2. sys_clk_n: This represents the negative phase of the differential input clock signal.\n3. sys_clk: This is the system clock, used when the input clock type is not differential.\n4. sys_rst_i: This represents the input system reset signal.\n\nExplanation: The differential clock signals (sys_clk_p and sys_clk_n) are primarily used when we want to reduce the influences of common-mode noise. For the system that is not utilizing differential clocking, the sys_clk will be used. The sys_rst_i signal is taken as an input to the module to perform synchronous reset operations on the entire system.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. clk0, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90: These are different clock signals generated by the module where clk0 is the divided clock out, sysclk_2x and sysclk_2x_180 are 2x and inverted 2x clock signals, mcb_drp_clk is a divided clock used for memory controller, pll_ce_0 and pll_ce_90 are phase-separated clocks for serdes modules.\n2. rst0: This is a reset signal synchronized with the clk0 clock signal.\n3. async_rst: This is the asynchronous reset signal.\n4. pll_lock: This indicates whether the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) is locked or not.\n\nExplanation: These output ports deliver multiple clock signals which are used elsewhere in the system for various synchronous operations. 'rst0' is a synchronous reset signal that ensures safe reset of the system and 'async_rst' is an asynchronous reset signal that can reset the system immediately irrespective of the clock. The pll_lock signal is an indicator of the stability and functional readiness of the PLL."
