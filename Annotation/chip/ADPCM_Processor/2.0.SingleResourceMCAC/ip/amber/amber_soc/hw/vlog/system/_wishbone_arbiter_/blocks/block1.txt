Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for outputting write-back data and acknowledging or handling errors during the process. It transmits the data read from the master to the write-back data output. If the current master is valid (non-zero), it also allows the acknowledging process and the error detection process to work, otherwise, these processes would output a default value of zero.
