This block of code defines a state flipping mechanism for variable `ReceiveEnd` driven by the module's clock `MRxClk` or a reset signal. When a hardware reset signal (`Reset`) is detected, the variable `ReceiveEnd` is asynchronously forced to a low state, representing that a receiving operation is not finished, with a delay of `Tp`. In normal operation (no reset), on each positive edge of the incoming clock (`MRxClk`), the `ReceiveEnd`'s state is updated based on `LoadRxStatus` with a delay of `Tp`, which could be indicating whether a receiving operation has reached its end-status or not.
