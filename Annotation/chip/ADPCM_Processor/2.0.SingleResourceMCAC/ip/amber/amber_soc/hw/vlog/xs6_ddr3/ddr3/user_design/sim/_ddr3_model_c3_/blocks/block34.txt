This block of code performs a timing check whenever a negative edge occurs on the dqs_in[31] signal. The implementation is done through a hardware event-driven procedure always@ which is sensitive to the falling edge (negative edge) of the signal dqs_in[31], typically, this is associated with data read/write operations relative to a memory interface DLL (Data Link Layer). Upon every negative edge detected, function dqs_pos_timing_check is invoked with the parameter '31'.
