Module name: a25_dcache. Module specification: The a25_dcache module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting customizable cache lines, words per line, and associativity. It manages read and write operations, cache misses and hits, and implements a write-back policy with features like cache flushing and exclusive access handling. The module interfaces with the processor core and external memory system through input ports for clock, requests, data, addresses, and control signals, and output ports for read data, stall signals, and memory requests. Internal signals manage cache state, data selection, hit detection, and replacement policies. The module is structured with sections for cache initialization, state machine control, tag and data memory management, hit detection logic, and data selection based on cache ways. It includes logic for handling exclusive accesses, write operations, and cache line replacement using a random policy. The design incorporates error checking for multiple cache way hits and supports
