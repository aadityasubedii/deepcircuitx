The block of code serves to model a delay line for an input address (addr). It is implemented using a non-blocking assignment statement within an 'always' block that is triggered upon any changes to the address input. The delay amount is defined by the constant 'BUS_DELAY'. The resultant delayed address is then placed on the 'addr_in' line.
