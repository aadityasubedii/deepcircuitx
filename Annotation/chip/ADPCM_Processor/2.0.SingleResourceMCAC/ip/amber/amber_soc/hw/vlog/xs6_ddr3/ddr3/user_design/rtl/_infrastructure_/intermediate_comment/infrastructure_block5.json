    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for handling the reset and lock mechanisms related to a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) within a digital system. The system incorporates an 'always' block which is triggered at the rising edge of the `clk0_bufg` or the system reset `sys_rst`. If system reset occurs, the `syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked` variable is reset to 0 indicating the power up process for the PLL is not locked. However, if the `bufpll_mcb_locked` signal is high, `syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked` signal is set to 1 meaning the system PLL is locked during the power up."
