    "module": "Module-level comment: The a23_multiply module executes 32-bit multiplication and, based on control signal `i_function`, optionally accumulates the result. Inputs indicate multiplicands and control states, outputs deliver result, zero/negative indicators and operation completion flag. Booth-style multiplication is implemented using internal signals including 34-bit counterparts of a multiplicand, counters to track operation steps, and accumulators configured for FPGA board-specific adders or generic ones. Functionality is mainly governed through `always` blocks conditioned on various stages represented by count values, actualizing updates on the positive clock edge."
