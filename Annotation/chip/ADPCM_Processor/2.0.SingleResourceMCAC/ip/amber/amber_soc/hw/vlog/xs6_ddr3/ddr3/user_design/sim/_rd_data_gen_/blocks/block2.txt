This block is a data generator for the Spartan6 family of Xilinx FPGAs. It conditionally instantiates (generate, if statements) `sp6_data_gen` module when the `FAMILY` is `"SPARTAN6"`. This module is parameterized with values for transfer characteristics, address width, data width, data pattern, and other properties (passed as arguments starting with "."). The block takes clock, reset, read-ready, seed, mode of data, multiple start commands, fixed data, address, and FIFO ready signals as inputs and provides generated data as an output signal.
