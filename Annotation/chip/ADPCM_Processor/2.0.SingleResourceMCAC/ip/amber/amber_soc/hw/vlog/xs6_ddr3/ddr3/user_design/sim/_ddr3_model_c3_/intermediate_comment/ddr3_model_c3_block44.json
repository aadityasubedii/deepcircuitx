    "block_comment": "This block is designed to monitor the falling edge (negative edge) of signal 'dqs_in' at index [21] and call the function 'dqs_pos_timing_check' when it happens. The function dqs_pos_timing_check is invoked with the argument 21, implying that the function uses this argument to perform some operations related to timing checks, possibly some form of synchronization or event triggering based on the timing of the falling edge of the 'dqs_in[21]'."
