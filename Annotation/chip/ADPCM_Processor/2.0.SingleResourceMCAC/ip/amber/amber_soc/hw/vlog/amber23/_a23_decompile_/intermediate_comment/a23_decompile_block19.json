    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a task in Verilog, named `w_mtrans_type`, utilized for writing certain strings to a file referred by `decompile_file`, based on the value of `mtrans_itype`. The implementation uses a `case` structure within the task. Depending on the hexadecimal value of `mtrans_itype`, different strings- 'da', 'ia', 'db', 'ib', or 'xx' (by default), are written to the designated file."
