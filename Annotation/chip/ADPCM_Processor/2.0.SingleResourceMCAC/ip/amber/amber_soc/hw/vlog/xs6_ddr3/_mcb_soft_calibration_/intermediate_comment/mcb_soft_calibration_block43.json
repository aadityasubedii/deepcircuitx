    "block_comment": "This block of code carries out a division operation and manages state transitions. The function 'Mult_Divide' takes three arguments; the first argument is the previous \"P_Term\" value subtracted by 1, the second and third parameters are \"MULT\" and \"DIV\". The result of this division operation is then stored back in \"P_Term\". After that, the state of the module is set to \"LOAD_ZIO_PTERM\"."
