    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for controlling the transmission retry in a hardware system when a transmission isn't successful. As an implementation detail, the block includes a flip-flop that is set and reset according to certain conditions. Specifically, the retry is reset at the positive edge of either the master transmit clock or a reset signal. When transmission starts and there is no previous status latch, the transmission retry is reset. On the other hand, if the system signals a transmission retry, the retry signal is set."
