    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles interrupt and exception requests in a computing system. It checks for the presence of Fast Interrupt Request (FIRQ), Interrupt Request (IRQ), Software Interrupt (SWI) and Data Abort (DABT) flags and associates them with the respective request. FIRQ and IRQ requests are conditionally assigned based on the corresponding flags and the inverted bits 26 and 27 of the execute_status register. SWI request is assigned when an SWI type is detected, while the DABT request is directly assigned from the dabt_reg register."
