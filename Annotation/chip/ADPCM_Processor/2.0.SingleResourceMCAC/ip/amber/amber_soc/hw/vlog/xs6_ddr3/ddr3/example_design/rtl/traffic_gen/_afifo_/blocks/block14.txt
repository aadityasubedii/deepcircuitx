The block of code assigns the 'wr_ptr' output to the 'wr_addr' input. This is a simple assignment operation in Verilog which is used to ensure 'wr_addr' directly reflects the current state of 'wr_ptr'. The 'assign' statement is continuously active, meaning 'wr_addr' will dynamically change to match 'wr_ptr' whenever 'wr_ptr' changes.
