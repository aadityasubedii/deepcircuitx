    "block_comment": "The block of code generates error mapping and cumulative error tracking for data quality lanes. This is achieved using a for loop that iterates over the DQ_ERROR_WIDTH range. In each iteration, an error mapping for the current index is generated by logically OR-ing the corresponding error byte and its displacements. Additionally, a cumulative error at the current index is calculated by logically OR-ing the corresponding previous cumulative error and the current data quality lane error."
