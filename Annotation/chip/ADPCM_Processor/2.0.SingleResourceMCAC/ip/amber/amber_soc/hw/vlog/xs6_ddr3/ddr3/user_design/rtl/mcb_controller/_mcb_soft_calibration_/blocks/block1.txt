This block of code is a complex hardware state machine, implemented in the Verilog language, that handles multiple memory controller signals for dynamic calibration of the Data-Strobe Signal (DQS) delay by controlling its increment and decrement. It primarily operates synchronously with respect to the User Interface clock (UI_CLK). The machine has very many states for assigning and manipulating a range of memory controller signals, intercommunicating with other blocks of the design as necessary. These include reading and writing data, setting up and waiting for commands, analysing maximum value conditions, incrementing or decrementing DQS delay and maintaining the state of calibration through a combination of conditional and sequential logic.
