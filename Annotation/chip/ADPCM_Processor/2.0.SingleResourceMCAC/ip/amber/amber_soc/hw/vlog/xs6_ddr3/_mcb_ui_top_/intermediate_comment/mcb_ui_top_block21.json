    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to synchronize the input of the module by using the 'uo_done_cal' signal. The '.synch_in' directive indicates that the 'uo_done_cal' signal is being used as a synchronizer, helping to ensure that the logic in the module operates coherently in line with the timing of the 'uo_done_cal' signal. The signal 'uo_done_cal' would typically track when a certain operation or calculator within the system finishes an operation, and thus would help the overall logic or system to be aware of the status or the progress, and allow for correct synchronization."
