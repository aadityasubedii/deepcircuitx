    "block_comment": "The block of code implements a data pattern generator for Pseudorandom Binary Sequences (PRBS). The generator is specified by `data_prbs_gen` with a width of 32 for both PRBS and seed, and it is governed by the `EYE_TEST` condition. The generator is clocked by `clk_i` and reset by `rst_i`. The enable signal is `data_clk_en`, and the seed is taken from input `prbs_fseed_i` when the signal `cmd_startE` is high. The seed can also be updated from certain parts of `m_addr_i`. Generated PRBS data is passed through `prbs_data`."
