    "block_comment": "This block of code represents an output buffer (`OBUFT`) for a memory controller block command (named `mcbx_dram_cas_n`). This output buffer (`OBUFT`) is instantiated as `iob_cas`, and it facilitates interfacing between the internal circuits and the corresponding output pin while maintaining output impedance. The '.O' specifies the output, '.I' specifies the input signal, and '.T' refers to the tristate control. Here, 'ioi_cas' is fed as input and directed to the command output signal 'mcbx_dram_cas_n', controlled by the 't_cas' tristate control."
