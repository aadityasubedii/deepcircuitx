    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for generating a read strobe signal (rd_strobe). The 'assign' statement in Verilog is used to create combinational logic, with the signal on the left (rd_strobe) getting assigned the value of the expression on the right. In this case, the read strobe is enabled (rd_en is high) and the system is not empty (!empty). When both these conditions are true, rd_strobe signal goes high, indicating a valid read operation can take place. This ensures data is only read when 'rd_en' is high and the system isn't empty."
