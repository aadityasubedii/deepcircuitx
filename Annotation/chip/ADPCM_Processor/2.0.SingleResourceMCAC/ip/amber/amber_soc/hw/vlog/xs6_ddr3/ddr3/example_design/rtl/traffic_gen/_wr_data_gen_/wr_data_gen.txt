Module-level comment: The 'wr_data_gen' module is a data generator primarily for handling write operations for SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 FPGA families. The module processes inputs such as clock, reset, pseudo-random sequence seed, command validation, data mode, address, burst length, and data readiness signals. It outputs command readiness, last word in burst, data validity, data, and end of write data signals. Internally, it maintains signals for write data, command readiness and initiation, burst count, FIFO fullness check, and last word readiness. The operations are organized into 'always' and 'generate' blocks for different functional scenarios, controlled via parameters. It separately invokes SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 data generators based on FPGA family parameter.
