Comment: 
This block of code defines the conditions by which the 'ex_read_hit' signal is assigned in the cache memory subsystem. The 'ex_read_hit' gets high if there is an exclusive read operation, indicated by 'exclusive_access', and no concurrent write operation, indicated by 'i_write_enable', alongside a hit in the cache ('hit') or a hit in the read buffer of the write-back mechanism ('wb_read_buf_hit').
