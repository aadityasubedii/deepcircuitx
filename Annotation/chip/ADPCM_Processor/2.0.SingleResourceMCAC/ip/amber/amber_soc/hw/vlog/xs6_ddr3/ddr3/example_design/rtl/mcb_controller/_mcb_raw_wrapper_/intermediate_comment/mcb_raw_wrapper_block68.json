    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a control structure that assigns data to the various memory interface (MIG) controller ports based on the condition if the port triggers are enabled. If the control port (C_PORT_ENABLE[5]) is logic high ('1'), the inputs to the command module ports are assigned their respective values, activating the respective operations like the command clock, command enabling, row, bank, column addresses, and others. On the contrary, if this control port is not triggered or logic low ('0'), the input signals to the command unit are all set to logic zero ('0'), which essentially keeps the MIG controller ports inactive or disabled."
