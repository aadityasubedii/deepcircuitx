The output ports encompass o_uart_txd and o_uart_rts_n, through which it respectively outputs the transmitted data and signals a request to send for flow control on the receiver side. \n\nInternally, the tb_uart module utilizes a variety of signals that manage the timing and control aspects of the UART protocol, including those handling clock and reset, state variables for the control of UART transmission and reception, the functionality to write the received data into a FIFO buffer and read from it, counter for the received and transmitted bits, and edge detectors for the start of incoming data. \n\nDifferent blocks of the module perform a series of functions such as initializations, managing UART transmission and reception flow control including start of a bit and byte, overflowing, looping back and warnings of UART FIFO overflow and state transitions. \n\nThe entirety of these operations creates the synchronized and managed environment of UART transmission and reception, providing the module with its extensive communication capabilities via UART."
