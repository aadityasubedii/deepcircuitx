Comment: 
This block governs the state transitions in a synchronous system. Upon every positive edge of the DRP_CLK signal, the current state is updated. If a synchronous reset (sync_rst) is prompted, the state is forced back to the 'READY' state. Else, the state transitions as directed by 'nextstate'.
