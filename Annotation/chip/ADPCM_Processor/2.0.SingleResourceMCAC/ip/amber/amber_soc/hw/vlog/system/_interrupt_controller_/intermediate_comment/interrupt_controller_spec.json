    "spec": "Module name: interrupt_controller. \n\nModule Specification: \n\nThe `interrupt_controller` is a Verilog module designed to handle various types of interrupts within a system. This module manages the enabling and disabling of interrupt requests (IRQs) and fast interrupt requests (FIRQs), along with setting and clearing of software interrupts. It interfaces with components like UARTs, Ethernet MAC, and timers by adopting the Wishbone Bus protocol for data read and write operations. It also provides support for debugging, enabling tracing of register access.\n\nThe input ports include i_clk (system clock input), i_wb_adr (Wishbone Bus address input signal), i_wb_sel (Wishbone Bus select signal), i_wb_we (Wishbone Bus write enable signal),i_wb_dat (Wishbone Bus data input), i_wb_cyc (Wishbone Bus cycle signal), i_wb_stb (Wishbone Bus strobe input signal), i_uart0_int, i_uart1_int (interrupt inputs from UART0 and UART1), i_ethmac_int (interrupt input from Ethernet MAC), i_test_reg_irq, i_test_reg_firq (test inputs for the IRQ and FIRQ), i_tm_timer_int (interrupts from timers). \n\nThe output ports include o_wb_dat (Wishbone Bus data output), o_wb_ack (Wishbone Bus acknowledge signal), o_wb_err (Wishbone Bus error signal), o_irq (interrupt request signal), o_firq (fast interrupt request signal).\n\nInternally, the module uses an enable register to control interrupt source, two registers to hold the status of software interrupts, a wire to collect raw interrupt signals, several wires to hold interrupt signals after being masked, registers for storing data related to read operations, and wires to carry data for writing into a register. \n\nThe module operation can be mainly divided into two blocks. One block is for handling data read and write operations, and the other block is for interrupt handling. The first block includes signals and conditions for detecting and executing read and write operations. It includes a mechanism to generate acknowledge and error signals based on the operations performed. The second block is for interrupt handling where interrupt signals are collected, masked or unmasked, and then the interrupt request signals are generated. Further, test registers are in place for debugging purposes.\n",

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals:\n\n1. irq0_enable_reg, firq0_enable_reg, irq1_enable_reg, firq1_enable_reg: These internal signals are registers which control whether or not an individual interrupt source contributes to the aggregated interrupt signal. An interrupt source is enabled when its corresponding bit in enable register is set.\n\n2. softint_0_reg, softint_1_reg: These registers hold the status of software interrupts.\n\n3. raw_interrupts: This is a wire which collects and maps the raw interrupt signals from all the interrupt sources.\n\n4. irq0_interrupts, firq0_interrupts, irq1_interrupts, firq1_interrupts: These wires contain the interrupt signals after being masked with the enable register. The bits of the raw interrupt signals align with the corresponding bits in the interrupt enable register.\n\n5. irq_0, firq_0, irq_1, firq_1: These wires OR together the respective IRQ and FIRQ signals and special test register signals to generate the output IRQ and FIRQ signals.\n\n6. wb_rdata32: This register stores the data to be returned to the CPU on a bus read operation.\n\n7. wb_start_write, wb_start_read: These wires detect if a read or write operation is intended.\n\n8. wb_start_read_d1: This is a one clock delayed version of the wb_start_read signal.\n\n9. wb_wdata32: This wire holds the data to be written to the write data register.\n\nExplanation:\n \n1. An internal enable register allows each interrupt source to be enabled or disabled individually. This is especially useful in debug scenarios or when problems with certain devices occur.\n\n2. Software interrupts are stored in internal registers and can be used to control or divert the program flow.\n\n3. The raw_interrupts wire collects all the individual interrupt signals and maps them to individual bits of this 32-bit vector. \n\n4. These are the masked version of the corresponding raw interrupt signals. Internal enable registers are used to mask the raw interrupts.\n\n5. These wires generate the output IRQ and FIRQ signals by aggregating the signals from multiple sources.\n\n6. The data to be returned to the CPU during a read operation is stored in an internal register.\n\n7. These wires detect whether a read or write operation is intended, based on the input control signals from the CPU.\n\n8. This wire makes sure there are no conflicts between read and write operations by delaying the read operation signal.\n\n9. Data to be written into a register is held in this wire. This data comes from the input port of the module."

It also provides support for debugging, enabling tracing of register access.\n\nThe input ports include i_clk (system clock input), i_wb_adr (Wishbone Bus address input signal), i_wb_sel (Wishbone Bus select signal), i_wb_we (Wishbone Bus write enable signal),i_wb_dat (Wishbone Bus data input), i_wb_cyc (Wishbone Bus cycle signal), i_wb_stb (Wishbone Bus strobe input signal), i_uart0_int, i_uart1_int (interrupt inputs from UART0 and UART1), i_ethmac_int (interrupt input from Ethernet MAC), i_test_reg_irq, i_test_reg_firq (test inputs for the IRQ and FIRQ), i_tm_timer_int (interrupts from timers). \n\nThe output ports include o_wb_dat (Wishbone Bus data output), o_wb_ack (Wishbone Bus acknowledge signal), o_wb_err (Wishbone Bus error signal), o_irq (interrupt request signal), o_firq (fast interrupt request signal).\n\nInternally, the module uses an enable register to control interrupt source, two registers to hold the status of software interrupts, a wire to collect raw interrupt signals, several wires to hold interrupt signals after being masked, registers for storing data related to read operations, and wires to carry data for writing into a register. \n\nThe module operation can be mainly divided into two blocks. One block is for handling data read and write operations, and the other block is for interrupt handling. The first block includes signals and conditions for detecting and executing read and write operations. It includes a mechanism to generate acknowledge and error signals based on the operations performed. The second block is for interrupt handling where interrupt signals are collected, masked or unmasked, and then the interrupt request signals are generated. Further, test registers are in place for debugging purposes.\n"

An interrupt source is enabled when its corresponding bit in enable register is set.\n\n2. softint_0_reg, softint_1_reg: These registers hold the status of software interrupts.\n\n3. raw_interrupts: This is a wire which collects and maps the raw interrupt signals from all the interrupt sources.\n\n4. irq0_interrupts, firq0_interrupts, irq1_interrupts, firq1_interrupts: These wires contain the interrupt signals after being masked with the enable register. The bits of the raw interrupt signals align with the corresponding bits in the interrupt enable register.\n\n5. irq_0, firq_0, irq_1, firq_1: These wires OR together the respective IRQ and FIRQ signals and special test register signals to generate the output IRQ and FIRQ signals.\n\n6. wb_rdata32: This register stores the data to be returned to the CPU on a bus read operation.\n\n7. wb_start_write, wb_start_read: These wires detect if a read or write operation is intended.\n\n8. wb_start_read_d1: This is a one clock delayed version of the wb_start_read signal.\n\n9. wb_wdata32: This wire holds the data to be written to the write data register.\n\nExplanation:\n \n1. An internal enable register allows each interrupt source to be enabled or disabled individually. This is especially useful in debug scenarios or when problems with certain devices occur.\n\n2. Software interrupts are stored in internal registers and can be used to control or divert the program flow.\n\n3. The raw_interrupts wire collects all the individual interrupt signals and maps them to individual bits of this 32-bit vector. \n\n4. These are the masked version of the corresponding raw interrupt signals. Internal enable registers are used to mask the raw interrupts.\n\n5. These wires generate the output IRQ and FIRQ signals by aggregating the signals from multiple sources.\n\n6. The data to be returned to the CPU during a read operation is stored in an internal register.\n\n7. These wires detect whether a read or write operation is intended, based on the input control signals from the CPU.\n\n8. This wire makes sure there are no conflicts between read and write operations by delaying the read operation signal.\n\n9. Data to be written into a register is held in this wire. This data comes from the input port of the module."

It interfaces with components like UARTs, Ethernet MAC, and timers by adopting the Wishbone Bus protocol for data read and write operations. It also provides support for debugging, enabling tracing of register access.\n\nThe input ports include i_clk (system clock input), i_wb_adr (Wishbone Bus address input signal), i_wb_sel (Wishbone Bus select signal), i_wb_we (Wishbone Bus write enable signal),i_wb_dat (Wishbone Bus data input), i_wb_cyc (Wishbone Bus cycle signal), i_wb_stb (Wishbone Bus strobe input signal), i_uart0_int, i_uart1_int (interrupt inputs from UART0 and UART1), i_ethmac_int (interrupt input from Ethernet MAC), i_test_reg_irq, i_test_reg_firq (test inputs for the IRQ and FIRQ), i_tm_timer_int (interrupts from timers). \n\nThe output ports include o_wb_dat (Wishbone Bus data output), o_wb_ack (Wishbone Bus acknowledge signal), o_wb_err (Wishbone Bus error signal), o_irq (interrupt request signal), o_firq (fast interrupt request signal).\n\nInternally, the module uses an enable register to control interrupt source, two registers to hold the status of software interrupts, a wire to collect raw interrupt signals, several wires to hold interrupt signals after being masked, registers for storing data related to read operations, and wires to carry data for writing into a register. \n\nThe module operation can be mainly divided into two blocks. One block is for handling data read and write operations, and the other block is for interrupt handling. The first block includes signals and conditions for detecting and executing read and write operations. It includes a mechanism to generate acknowledge and error signals based on the operations performed. The second block is for interrupt handling where interrupt signals are collected, masked or unmasked, and then the interrupt request signals are generated. Further, test registers are in place for debugging purposes.\n"
