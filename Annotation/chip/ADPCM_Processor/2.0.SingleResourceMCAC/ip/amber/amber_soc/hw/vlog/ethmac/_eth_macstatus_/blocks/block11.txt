Comment: 
This Verilog block triggers at the positive edge of the MRxClk or Reset signals and primarily manages the flag 'InvalidSymbol'. When a reset occurs, the 'InvalidSymbol' flag is immediately cleared. If the 'LoadRxStatus' flag is active and 'SetInvalidSymbol' inactive, then 'InvalidSymbol' will also be cleared. However, if the 'SetInvalidSymbol' flag is activated, then 'InvalidSymbol' is set.
