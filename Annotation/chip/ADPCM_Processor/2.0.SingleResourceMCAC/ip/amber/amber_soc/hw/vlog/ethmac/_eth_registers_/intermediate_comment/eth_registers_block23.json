    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a synchronous reset mechanism for the `SetTxCIrq_sync1` signal. Triggered by either a positive clock edge (`Clk`) or a positive reset edge (`Reset`), it prioritizes the reset signal. If the `Reset` signal is at a positive edge, the `SetTxCIrq_sync1` signal is set to '0'. Alternatively, if there is a positive clock edge and `Reset` is not active, the `SetTxCIrq_sync1` signal follows the value of the `SetTxCIrq_txclk` signal."
