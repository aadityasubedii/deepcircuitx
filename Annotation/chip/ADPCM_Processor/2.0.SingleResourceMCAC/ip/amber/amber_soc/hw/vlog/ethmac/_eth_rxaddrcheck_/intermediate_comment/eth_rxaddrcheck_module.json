    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'eth_rxaddrcheck' module verifies the destination MAC addresses of incoming Ethernet frames. It sorts received frames into Unicast, Multicast or Broadcast types, and sets respective flags. Utilizing inputs such as data, control signals, hash outputs, and timing signals, the module performs checks and adjustments based on multiple conditions and uses a comprehensive set of internal signals for processing and validation. In cases of invalid frames, it triggers aborts or address miss signals. Its design involves immediate assignments, combinational and sequential logic responding to the clock or reset signal edges, and updating of output and internal signals. The module's implementation contributes significantly to validating frame address and type in an Ethernet receiver design.\n"
