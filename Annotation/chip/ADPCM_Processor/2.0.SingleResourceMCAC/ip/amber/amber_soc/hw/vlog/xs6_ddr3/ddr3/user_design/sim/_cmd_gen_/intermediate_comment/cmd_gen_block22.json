    "block_comment": "This block of code is tasked with calculating and updating the end address of a memory block on the positive edge of a clock signal. It leverages a delay-based system, parameterized by the 'TCQ', to manage the timing between successive address updates. Particularly, the block performs a subtraction operation on 'end_addr_i' (input end address) reduced by product of 'DWIDTH/8' and 'bl_out_reg', and then increments the resulting number by 1."
