    "block_comment": "The block of code serves as a reset function for the Verilog module. It is always active and sensitive to the `rst_n` (negative active reset) signal. When `rst_n` changes state, the code causes a delay due to parameter `BUS_DELAY` and then assigns the delayed value to the signal `rst_n_in`. The delay represents the propagation time needed for changes to travel along the bus."
