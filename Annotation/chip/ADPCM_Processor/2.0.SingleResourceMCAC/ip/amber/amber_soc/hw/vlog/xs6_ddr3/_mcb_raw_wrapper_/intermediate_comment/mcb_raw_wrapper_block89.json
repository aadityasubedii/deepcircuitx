    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a function `cdiv` in Verilog, which performs a ceiling division operation. It takes two integers as input arguments, the dividend and the divisor, and returns the result of the division operation rounded up to the nearest integer. It employs a simple mathematical formula: the floor division result (num/div) plus one if there's a remainder (num%div is greater than 0) or zero if there's no remainder. This function can be utilized where standard division would apply but the result needs to be an integer rather than a fraction."
