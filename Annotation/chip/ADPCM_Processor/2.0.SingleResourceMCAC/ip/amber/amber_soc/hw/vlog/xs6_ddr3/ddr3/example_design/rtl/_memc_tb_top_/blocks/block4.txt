This block is designed to manage command field mapping for a data port ("P2") in a memory controller. Depending on the port mode (read or write) and which other ports are enabled, it selectively maps the command fields (enable signal, instruction, address, byte lane, write-enable signal) of P2 to those of another port. If port 2 is enabled and in read mode, it checks which of the other ports (from P0 to P5) are not only enabled but preferably favoring ports in write mode. The implemented code prioritizes the mapping to write-mode ports (P3, P4, P5) before resorting to the read-mode ports (P0, P1, P2). In write mode or if none of the other ports are enabled, the port maps the command fields to itself.
