Module name: sp6_data_gen. Module specification: The sp6_data_gen module is designed to generate various data patterns for testing purposes in Verilog hardware designs. It supports walking, hammer, address, and pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) data patterns, with adjustable bit-width (DWIDTH) and pattern selection via input parameters. The module has several input ports including clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), data mode (data_mode_i), start commands (cmd_startA-E), and various data inputs. The primary output is data_o, which contains the generated data pattern. Internal signals such as prbs_data, adata, hdata, ndata, and w1data are used to store different data patterns. The module is divided into several blocks, including pattern generation logic for different data types (walking, hammer, address, PRBS), output selection based on data
