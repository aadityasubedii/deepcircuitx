    "block_comment": "This block of code performs the function of generating a mask from a value called \"mtrans_reg1\". It achieves its function by implementing a bitwise shift operation. Specifically, it assigns the \"mtrans_reg2_mask\" register with the result of shifting '1' to the left by the number of places indicated by the value of \"mtrans_reg1\". By this way, a mask of 1's is created starting from the lowermost bit to the dictated position."
