    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block manages the propagation delay for the input clock signal in a hardware design. It's a simple delay mechanism where the value of the 'ck' signal, presumably a clock signal, is assigned to the 'ck_in' signal after a delay of 'BUS_DELAY' time units. This block utilises non-blocking assignments ('<=') to ensure that changes in the 'ck' signal don't immediately affect 'ck_in', thus simulating the real-world propagation delay of electronic signals in hardware circuits."
