    "block_comment": "This code block is a state machine that manages data transmission with different states including IDLE, WAIT, POLL, PREA, PREB, TX_0, TX_1 and CRC0. In the IDLE state, it resets key variables and if a specific bit is set, it increments a counter to shift to the POLL state. In the POLL state, it reads data from a file and checks if the data differs from the previous packet. If so, it transitions to the PREA state, writes an acknowledgment into a file, and prepares for transmission by setting initial transmission conditions. Following this, it sequentially enters the PREB, TX_0, and TX_1 states to transmit data. If all packets are transmitted, it transitions to the CRC0 state to transmit a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) value, then returns to the POLL state. In case of no updated data, it simply transitions back to the WAIT state to wait for new packets."
