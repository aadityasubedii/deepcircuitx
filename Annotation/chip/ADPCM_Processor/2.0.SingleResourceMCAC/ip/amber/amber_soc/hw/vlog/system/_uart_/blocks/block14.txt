Comment: 
This Verilog RTL code section is a state machine handling UART reception. It synchronously reads serial data bits through i_uart_rxd whenever the rx_bit_pulse_count hits RX_BITPULSE_COUNT at the positive edge of i_clk. States (RXD_IDLE to RXD_STOP) define the process, transitioning sequentially when certain conditions are met. When a data byte is successfully read, the state machine toggles back to the idle state, ready to read the next byte if FIFO is not full. A restart signal restart_rx_bit_count is used to signal the start of counting a new bit pulse.
