    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is used to trigger the procedure `dq_timing_check` whenever there is a change in bit number 26 of the `dq_in` bus. This is achieved by using the `always@` construct in Verilog, which creates a sensitivity list that triggers a code block whenever a change is detected on the signal within the parenthesis. When the 26th bit of `dq_in` changes, the `dq_timing_check` procedure specific to the 26th line is then activated."
