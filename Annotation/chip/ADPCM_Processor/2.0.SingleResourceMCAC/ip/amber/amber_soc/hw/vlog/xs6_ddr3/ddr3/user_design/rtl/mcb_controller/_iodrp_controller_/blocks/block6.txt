This block of code is an always block that is triggered by a rising edge of the DRP_CLK signal. The main function of the block is to reset or update the value of the variable read_data based on certain conditions. If the sync_rst signal is high, the read_data variable is reset to 8'h00. If the block is not in reset, the code checks if the current state equals ALMOST_READY. If this condition is satisfied, the value of read_data is updated to the value of shift_through_reg.
