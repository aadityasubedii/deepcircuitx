    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'a25_register_bank' module serves as a register bank designed for a processing core, managing register read/write operations, handling different modes and interrupts and stall conditions due to core or memory operations. The logic is primarily implemented using registers, internal signals, and a clock-edge-triggered always block. Inputs primarily direct the operation and the mode, while outputs provide register values and program counter. Internal signals help modularize the operations by holding control settings, decoded mode signals, write-enable lines, and transferred data. The functionality is distributed between assigning signals, a clock-edge conditional block, and final output assignments."
