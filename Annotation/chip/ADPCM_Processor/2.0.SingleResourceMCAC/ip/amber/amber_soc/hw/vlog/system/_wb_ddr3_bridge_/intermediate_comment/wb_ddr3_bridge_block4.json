    "block_comment": "This Verilog block defines a set of output signals based on the input signals with a sequence generated at every rising edge of the input clock (i_clk). Write enable signal (o_wr_en) is directly assigned the state of start_write. Write mask (o_wr_mask) assignment varies based on the type of system being used (XILINX_VIRTEX6_FPGA or others) and uses the address signal (i_wb_adr) to generate different possible masks. In XILINX_VIRTEX6_FPGA system, mask is checked for i_wb_adr[2] == 2'b2 and generates appropriate mask bits while in other systems 4 combinations are checked for i_wb_adr[3:2]. The write data signal(o_wr_data) is repeated four times of the incoming bus data(i_wb_dat)."
