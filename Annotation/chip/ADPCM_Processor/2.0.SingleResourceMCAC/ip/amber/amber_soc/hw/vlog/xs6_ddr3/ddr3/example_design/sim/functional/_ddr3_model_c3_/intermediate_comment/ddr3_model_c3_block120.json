    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is meant to monitor and call a function whenever a specific data element changes. It is implemented by listening for any changes in the 11th data bit in the dq_in data queue. Whenever the state of dq_in[10] changes, the \"dq_timing_check(10)\" function is triggered. This structure is designed to continuously check the timing of the specific data bit and react accordingly whenever it changes."
