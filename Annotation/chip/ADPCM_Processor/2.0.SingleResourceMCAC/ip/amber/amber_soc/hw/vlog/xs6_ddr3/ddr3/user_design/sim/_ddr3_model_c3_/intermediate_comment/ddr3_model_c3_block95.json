    "block_comment": "This block of code activates a timing check function whenever there's a change in the 36th bit (index [35]) of the input data stream (dq_in). It achieves functionality by passing the bit's index (35 in this case) to the `dq_timing_check` function, which presumably analyzes the data bit's timing characteristics for validation or diagnostic purposes."
