    "block_comment": "This block of code is a portion of a larger block that handles multiple branching decisions. In this specific instance, it executes when WAYS equals 4. The function of the block is to assign the value obtained from 'pick_way' function to 'next_way'. The 'pick_way' function takes 'valid_bits_r' and 'random_num' as input parameters. The implementation details involve utilizing a conditional (else if) statement to control the logic path based on the value of WAYS. When WAYS equals 4, it uses a function called 'pick_way' to select the 'next_way'. This function uses a random number and 'valid_bits_r' to make the selection, inferring variability in the selection process."
