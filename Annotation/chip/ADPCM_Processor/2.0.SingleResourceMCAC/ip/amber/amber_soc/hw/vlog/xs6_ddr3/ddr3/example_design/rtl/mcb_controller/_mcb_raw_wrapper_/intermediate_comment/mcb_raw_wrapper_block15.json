    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code configures several Memory Controller Block I/O delay modules (IODRP2_MCB) for DDR memory interface, which feature both master and slave components. Each module is designed with the SERDES (Serializer/ Deserializer) Mode, delay value, data rate, and tap delay as parameters. IODRP2_MCB instances handle different data and control channels of the DDR interface, such as data bits (dq), data strobe signal (dqs), and mask bits (udm and ldm). They receive inputs from and send outputs to different parts of the system including delay control, preprocessed input data, and input/output clock signals. Data signals are explicitly assigned to module instances based on their predefined designated roles in the memory interface.```"
