Comment: 
The DECREMENT block primarily handles state transitions and signal updates in a memory control mechanism. The block transitions the STATE variable to START_DYN_CAL, indicating a dynamic calibration is about to start. It also sets MCB_UILDQSINC, MCB_UIUDQSINC, MCB_UILDQSDEC, and MCB_UIUDQSDEC to false, which may be connected to the operation of Dynamic Quiescent Signal (DQS) in the memory command interface. The DECREMENT block is conditioned on DQS_DELAY not being zero, implying this operation only occurs when there's a non-zero delay on the DQS line.
