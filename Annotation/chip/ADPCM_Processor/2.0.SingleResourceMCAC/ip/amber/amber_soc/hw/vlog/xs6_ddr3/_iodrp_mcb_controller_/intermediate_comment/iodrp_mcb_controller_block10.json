    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for selecting the output data. It operates as a multiplexer, where 'addr_data_sel_n' is the select line. If 'addr_data_sel_n' is high, the 7 least significant bits of 'memcell_addr_reg' are selected and prefixed with a '0', resulting in an 8-bit value appearing at 'data_out'. If it's low, the 7 least significant bits of 'data_reg' are selected and prefixed with a '0', which then forms the 8-bit 'data_out' value. The code primarily handles the selection between address-data and regular data, through the usage of conditional statement."
