    "block_comment": "This Verilog block manages the control data transmission based on a clock signal or a reset condition. On receiving a positive edge clock signal (MTxClk) or a reset signal (TxReset), the block is activated. If the reset condition is true, it sets the 8-bit ControlData to zero after a propagation delay (Tp). Otherwise, if the least significant bit of ByteCnt is not set, it maps the selected 8 bits from MuxedCtrlData to ControlData, also after a delay period defined by Tp."
