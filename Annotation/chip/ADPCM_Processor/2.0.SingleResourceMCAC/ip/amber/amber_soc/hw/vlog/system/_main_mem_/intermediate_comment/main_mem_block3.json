    "block_comment": "This block of code performs data read operation over the successive clock cycles. It latches start_read signal for two clock cycles using start_read_d1 and start_read_d2. During the first delay cycle (start_read_d1), the block determines which 32 bits out of the 128 bits (rd_data[127:0]) to be read based on the last two bits of addr_d1 and assigns it to wb_rdata32."
