    "block_comment": "This block implements a First In, First Out (FIFO) buffer for data transmission. In case the `fifo_enable` signal is active, the buffer performs different actions based on the states of `tx_fifo_push_not_full` and `tx_fifo_pop_not_empty`. If the buffer isn't full, it accepts new data (from `wb_wdata32`), increments the Write Pointer (`tx_fifo_wp`), and updates FIFO count. In case data is available in the buffer (not empty), it updates Read Pointer (`tx_fifo_rp`) and adjusts the FIFO count. However, when `fifo_enable` is off, it effectively disables the FIFO operations by resetting pointers and the count, and directly handles data using the flags."
