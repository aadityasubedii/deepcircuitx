The block of code inspects the state change in the 30th bit of the dq_in signal array, and invokes the function dq_timing_check whenever a state change occurs. The function dq_timing_check takes the index of the bit in the signal array (in this case, bit 29) as an argument, executing logic whose specifics are unknown without further context of the code. The always @ construct is a sensitivity list in Verilog, implying that the internal operations of the block are initiated when a change is detected at the stated condition, here being the 30th bit of dq_in.
