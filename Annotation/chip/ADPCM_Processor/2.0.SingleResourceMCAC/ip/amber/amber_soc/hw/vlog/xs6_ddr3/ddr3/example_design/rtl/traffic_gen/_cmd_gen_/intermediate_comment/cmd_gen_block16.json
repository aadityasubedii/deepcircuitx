    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for assigning a value to the 'bram_rdy_o' signal. The value that 'bram_rdy_o' gets is determined by a complex logical expression that is a result of bitwise AND & OR operations among various signals such as 'run_traffic_i', 'cmd_clk_en', 'bram_valid_i', and 'mode_load_pulse'. It basically indicates when there's traffic running, the command clock is enabled, the BRAM (Block RAM) is valid, or when there's a mode load pulse signal."
