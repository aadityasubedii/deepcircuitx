This block of code involves the handling of data transfers when the memory burst length is 8 in a memory read/write operation. It specifically conducts the necessary shifts to align the write data (w1data) depending upon the number of data pins (NUM_DQ_PINS). The data from the w1data variables is divided into four segments, which are updated separately using non-blocking assignments. Each segment of data is shifted using a concatenation operation that moves bits. This operation is implemented under a delay of TCQ time units, ensuring that the operations are conducted in correct sequential manner specified by the memory interface timing constraints.
