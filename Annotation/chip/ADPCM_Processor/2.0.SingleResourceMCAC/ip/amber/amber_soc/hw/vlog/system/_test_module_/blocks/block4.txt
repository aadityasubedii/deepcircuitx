Comment: 
This block of code manages the control of memory based on certain conditions. When the positive edge of the input clock ('i_clk') is detected, it checks if the write-back has started ('wb_start_write') and if the input write-back address ('i_wb_adr') is equal to the `AMBER_TEST_MEM_CTRL`. If these conditions are met, it updates the memory control register ('mem_ctrl_reg') with the LSB of the write-back data ('wb_wdata32[0]').
