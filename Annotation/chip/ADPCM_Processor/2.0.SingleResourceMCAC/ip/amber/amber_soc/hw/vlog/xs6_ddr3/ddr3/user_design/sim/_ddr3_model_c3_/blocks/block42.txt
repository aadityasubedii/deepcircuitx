Comment: 
This block of Verilog code triggers the `dqs_pos_timing_check(23)` function every time there's a negative edge detected in the 24th bit of dqs_in signal. Functionally, this ensures that the data transfer is happening at the correct timing because DQS signal is used for ensuring timing synchronization in memory interfaces. The function call `dqs_pos_timing_check(23)` which is called in this 'always' block might be responsible for the timing check operation by possibly checking the input value's timing with respect to the system clock.
