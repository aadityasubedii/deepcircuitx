    "block_comment": "This block represents a flip-flop that is triggered by the rising edge of signal `dqs_even[12]`. The flip-flop calls the `dqs_even_receiver` function for the 13th (indexed from zero) bit of `dqs_even` upon a positive edge, serving as a receiver of the data queuing system for this bit."
