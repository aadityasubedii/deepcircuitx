    "block_comment": "This block of code handles synchronizing a clock enable signal to a clock cycle in a hardware model. On each positive edge of the input clock (clk_i), the code assigns the value of the variable 'cmd_clk_en' to 'cmd_clk_en_r' after a delay defined by 'TCQ'. This takes place in an 'always' block, meaning the assignment will be performed at every rising edge of the clock cycle, ensuring synchronous operation. The 'TCQ' delays implementation allows modeling of propagation delay changes."
