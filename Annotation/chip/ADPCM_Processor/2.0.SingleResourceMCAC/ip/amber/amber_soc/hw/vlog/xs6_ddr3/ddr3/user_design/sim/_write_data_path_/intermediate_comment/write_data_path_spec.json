    "spec": "Module name: write_data_path. \n\nModule specification: The 'write_data_path' module is primarily designed to handle setup and operations for write-data functionality in FPGA, particularly for memory operations. The module uses parameters such as memory address width, data width, test patterns etc., and defines inputs & outputs for clock signals, command validation, data readiness, and data validity confirmation. It uses an instance of \"wr_data_gen\" module likely responsible for the actual data generation to be written in memory. \n\nThe module has various input ports: 'clk_i' for clock input, 'rst_i[9:0]' for reset signal, 'cmd_valid_i', 'cmd_validB_i', and 'cmd_validC_i' for command validation inputs, 'prbs_fseed_i[31:0]' likely an input seed for pseudorandom binary sequence generation, 'data_mode_i[3:0]' to select data operation mode, 'fixed_data_i[DWIDTH-1:0]' input for fixed data, 'addr_i[31:0]' which is memory address input, and 'bl_i[5:0]' which is block length input. The module has various output ports: 'cmd_rdy_o' which a command-ready output signal, 'data_valid_o' indicating data validity, 'last_word_wr_o' possibly indicating last word written, 'data_o[DWIDTH-1:0]' output of the data, 'data_mask_o[(DWIDTH/8) - 1:0]' data mask output, and 'data_wr_end_o' likely indicating the completion of a data write operation.\n\nInternal signals in the module include 'data_valid' likely holding the validity of data, and 'cmd_rdy' holding the readiness of the command. These signals can determine the status of the ongoing commands or operations.\n\nDifferent blocks include the parameter and port definitions, assign blocks for passing signals between logic and a module instantiation 'wr_data_gen'. The assign blocks are used to manipulate the data and pass information, while 'wr_data_gen' is used for actual data generation. The overview provided by previous explanations makes this module configurable, flexible for different operating conditions, and efficient for data write operations in memory. It's easily integrable into larger systems due to its clear input/output ports and internally managed operations.",

                    "text": "Module name: write_data_path. \n\nModule specification: The 'write_data_path' module is primarily designed to handle setup and operations for write-data functionality in FPGA, particularly for memory operations. The module uses parameters such as memory address width, data width, test patterns etc., and defines inputs & outputs for clock signals, command validation, data readiness, and data validity confirmation. It uses an instance of \"wr_data_gen\" module likely responsible for the actual data generation to be written in memory. \n\nThe module has various input ports: 'clk_i' for clock input, 'rst_i[9:0]' for reset signal, 'cmd_valid_i', 'cmd_validB_i', and 'cmd_validC_i' for command validation inputs, 'prbs_fseed_i[31:0]' likely an input seed for pseudorandom binary sequence generation, 'data_mode_i[3:0]' to select data operation mode, 'fixed_data_i[DWIDTH-1:0]' input for fixed data, 'addr_i[31:0]' which is memory address input, and 'bl_i[5:0]' which is block length input. The module has various output ports: 'cmd_rdy_o' which a command-ready output signal, 'data_valid_o' indicating data validity, 'last_word_wr_o' possibly indicating last word written, 'data_o[DWIDTH-1:0]' output of the data, 'data_mask_o[(DWIDTH/8) - 1:0]' data mask output, and 'data_wr_end_o' likely indicating the completion of a data write operation.\n\nInternal signals in the module include 'data_valid' likely holding the validity of data, and 'cmd_rdy' holding the readiness of the command. These signals can determine the status of the ongoing commands or operations.\n\nDifferent blocks include the parameter and port definitions, assign blocks for passing signals between logic and a module instantiation 'wr_data_gen'. The assign blocks are used to manipulate the data and pass information, while 'wr_data_gen' is used for actual data generation. The overview provided by previous explanations makes this module configurable, flexible for different operating conditions, and efficient for data write operations in memory. It's easily integrable into larger systems due to its clear input/output ports and internally managed operations."
