    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code represents a continuous assignment statement which is used to drive the `rd_bl_o` output signal with the value of `bl_i` input signal. This statement provides a direct link between these two signals, implying that any changes to the `bl_i` will be instantly reflected to the `rd_bl_o`. This is typically used when there's no need for any processing or logic operations between these two signals."
