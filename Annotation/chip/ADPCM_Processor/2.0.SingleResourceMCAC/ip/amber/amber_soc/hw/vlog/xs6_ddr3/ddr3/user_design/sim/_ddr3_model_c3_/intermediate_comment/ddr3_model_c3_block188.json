    "block_comment": "The code block listens for a positive edge signal on the 4th element of the 'dqs_odd' array to activate a receiver. When a positive edge is encountered in the 'dqs_odd' bit at the 3rd index (Verilog indexes start from 0), the 'dqs_odd_receiver' function with the argument 3 is called. Signal edges are a crucial concept in Verilog RTL and are used in clocking, flip-flops, and other synchronization applications."
