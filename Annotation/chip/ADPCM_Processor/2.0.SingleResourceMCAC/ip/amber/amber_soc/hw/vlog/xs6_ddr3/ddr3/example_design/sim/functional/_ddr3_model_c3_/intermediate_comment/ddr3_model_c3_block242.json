    "block_comment": "This block of code is a delay system for the signal \"ras_n\". It performs its function by using the Verilog non-blocking assignment operator (<=) to apply the \"BUS_DELAY\" time delay to the \"ras_n\" signal. Consequently, the \"ras_n\" signal will be delayed and reassigned to the \"ras_n_in\" variable whenever there is a change in the \"ras_n\" signal."
