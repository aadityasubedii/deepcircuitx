This block of code performs a positive edge timing check on the data strobe signal (dqs_in). The function is invoked whenever there is a positive edge transition (posedge) on the second bit (index 1) of the dqs_in array. It handles this event by calling the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function with '1' as an input argument, ensuring that the data strobe signal events are properly monitored and managed.
