    "block_comment": "The block governs the registers initialization and update in a typical synchronous digital design. When a reset is triggered (either high-level or low-level based on the system), all the involved registers are reset to their initial states, ensuring a known functionality starting point. If no reset is defined and the MdcEn is active, the registers are updated based on an entity governed timing parameter (Tp), with most of them basically implementing shift registers behavior for a sequential logic flow control and providing a latching mechanism for bytes."
