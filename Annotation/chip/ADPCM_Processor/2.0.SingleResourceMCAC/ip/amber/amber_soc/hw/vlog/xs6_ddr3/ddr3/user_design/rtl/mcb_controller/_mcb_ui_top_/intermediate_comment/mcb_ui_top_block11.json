    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code functions as a configuration manager when the S3_AXI_ENABLE setting is deactivated. It forwards the signals from interface pins to internal net identifiers, maintaining a continuity of information flow within the system. This block ensures that the enable, clock, and data signals for different commands (command, write, read) are appropriately distributed in the system for the third peripheral (p3). This is performed by assigning the input interface signals to the corresponding module internal signals. Conditions such as errors, data overflows or underflows, full or empty signals are also managed via similar mappings. This block does not perform any manipulations on the signal data but serves as a routing unit in an inactive AXI mode."
