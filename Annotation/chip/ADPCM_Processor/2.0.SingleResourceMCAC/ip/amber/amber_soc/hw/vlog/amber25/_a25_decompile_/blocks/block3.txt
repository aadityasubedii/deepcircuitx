The function "get_4bit_signal" retrieves a specific 4-bit signal based on an input 3-bit number. It employs a case operation to decide which 4-bit signal to return. If the input number is '0', it retrieves the 'o_byte_enable' signal from 'U_EXECUTE' macro. If the input is '1', it retrieves the 'mem_load_rd_r' signal recorded in 'U_WB' macro.
