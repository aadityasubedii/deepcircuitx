    "block_comment": "This block of code executes a function named 'dq_timing_check' whenever there is a change in the 31st bit (index 30) of the 'dq_in' input signal. The function, 'dq_timing_check', presumably runs some sort of time-related check or validation, with '30' passed as a parameter to specify the particular bit of 'dq_in' that has been altered. The 'always @' clause denotes the sensitivity list which triggers the function call, in this case, only changes at the 31st bit of 'dq_in' will invoke the 'dq_timing_check' function."
