Comment: 
This block of code is a multiplexer operation in Verilog. The operation selects one out of many inputs and forwards the selected input into a single line. The choice of the selected input is governed by a 'selector', `i_rds_sel` in this context. If, for instance, the selector has the binary value 0 (4'd0), `o_rd` will take the value of `r0_out`. Similarly, the outputs from `r0_out` to `r14_rds` are selected based on the selector's value, and if it doesn't match any predefined value, the default output `r15_out_rm_nxt` is selected.
