Parameters such as cache lines, cache words per line, and ways can be adjusted as required. The cache operates on an input clock signal and has provisions for handling core stalls, cache flushing, and read misses. It interfaces with a memory system through write-back requests (o_wb_req), reading write-back data (i_wb_read_data) and checking if write-back operation is ready (i_wb_ready). The core functioning is regulated mainly through a state machine with states like C_INIT, C_FILL, and CS_TURN_AROUND, among others, each handling different scenarios. The code also includes specific parts for different FPGA targets (like XILINX_SPARTAN6_FPGA), seamlessly integrating SRAM for tag and data storage. Debug, error messages, and FPGA specific configurations are handled through compiler directives."
