The block of code is performing a simple function assignment operation in Verilog, which is used for continuously assigning values from an input signal 'rdp_valid' to an output signal 'rdp_valid_o'. The operation will keep the output signal 'rdp_valid_o' updated with the same value as the 'rdp_valid' input signal at all times, effectively creating a direct functional link between them. This is a commonly used method in digital logic design to enforce real-time signal synchronization.
