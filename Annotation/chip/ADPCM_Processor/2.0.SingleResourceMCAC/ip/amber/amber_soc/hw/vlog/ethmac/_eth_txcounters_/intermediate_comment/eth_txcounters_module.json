    "module": "Module-level comment: The eth_txcounters module is a crucial part of an Ethernet transmitter design, responsible for counting bytes, nibbles, and monitoring various transmission states. Input states and controls govern the counters and the output signals reflect the counting results and status reports. The module leverages internal signals to increment, reset the counters, assert conditions for various states, and manage the delay of CRC cycle. It is designed with sections for counter management, deferral count, setting conditions for transmission states, and CRC delay. Accurate frame tracking is achieved through the combination of these functionalities."
