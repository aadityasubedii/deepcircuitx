    "block_comment": "This block primarily controls the modes and settings of data and address, and BRAM (Block Random Access Memory). It uses a combination of clock signal edge and conditional checks for modifying settings. When the clock signal rises (positive edge), the output modes for data and address are set. It also checks if 'syn1_vio_addr_mode_value' is 0 and 'vio_modify_enable' is high. If these conditions are met, it enables BRAM mode, otherwise it disables it."
