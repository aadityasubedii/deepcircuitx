This block of Verilog RTL code primarily handles the debugging messages for read and write operations to different registers in the Co-Processor 15. In case of positive edge clock cycle and absence of core stall, it enables write (operation code 2) to different registers (1 to 5) with by displaying a debug message with the write data. Similarly, it enables read (operation code 1) from different registers (0, 2 to 7) of the same Co-processor, displaying a debug message with the read data.
