The block of code is responsible for assigning the write-enable signal for a specific cache way. It handles this by issuing the signal when two conditions are satisfied: i) a cache fill is triggered and the selected way matches the corresponding way, or ii) a write hit occurs, the data hit is in the way, and the cache state is in idle mode.
