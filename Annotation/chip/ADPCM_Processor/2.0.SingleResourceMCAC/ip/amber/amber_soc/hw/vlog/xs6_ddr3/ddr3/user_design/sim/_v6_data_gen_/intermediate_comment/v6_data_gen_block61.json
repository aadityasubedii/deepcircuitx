    "block_comment": "The function \"Data_Gen\" generates data for a specific position within a fourfold larger dataset depending on the input integer 'i'. If 'i' is even, it sets four different 8-bit values (which increments in power of 2 from 00000001 to 00001000) into four different parts of \"Data_Gen\". If 'i' is odd, it puts the similar 8-bit values into four different parts but shifted 4 positions to left (from 00010000 to 10000000). The destination of these values within \"Data_Gen\" vector depends on the quotient of 'i' divided by 2 which is represented by 'j'. This way, the function provides a mechanism for dynamically inserting data at various positions."
