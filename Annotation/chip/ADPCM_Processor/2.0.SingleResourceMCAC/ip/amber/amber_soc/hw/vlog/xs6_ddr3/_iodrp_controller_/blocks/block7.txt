Comment: 
This block of code acts as a bit counter. The counter increases every positive transition of the DRP_CLK signal if the system is either in the ADDR_PHASE or DATA_PHASE and if there's no system reset. However, if the system is in any other state or if a synchronous reset is initiated, the bit counter is reset to zero.
