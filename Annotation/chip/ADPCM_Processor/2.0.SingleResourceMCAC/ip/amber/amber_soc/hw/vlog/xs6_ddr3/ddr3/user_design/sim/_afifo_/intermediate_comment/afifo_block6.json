    "block_comment": "This block implements an asynchronous reset and status check for a buffer. On every positive edge of the read clock (rd_clk), it checks whether a reset (rst) is active or if the buffer (buf_filled) is empty or can be read (via rd_strobe). If the reset is active or the buffer conditions are met, the 'empty' flag is set to high after a time delay defined by TCQ; otherwise, it's set to low, indicating the buffer has data and isn't being read or reset."
