    "block_comment": "The block controls the signal 'TxBDRead', which is likely associated with a transmit buffer descriptor read operation. It uses a clock signal (WB_CLK_I) or a reset signal to initialize: during a reset or when the StartTxBDRead is high, TxBDRead is set high; conversely, when the transmission buffer descriptor becomes ready (TxBDReady), TxBDRead is set to low, presumably indicating that a read operation is no longer needed. The signal transitions are edge-triggered, either at the rising edge of the clock signal or when a reset occurs."
