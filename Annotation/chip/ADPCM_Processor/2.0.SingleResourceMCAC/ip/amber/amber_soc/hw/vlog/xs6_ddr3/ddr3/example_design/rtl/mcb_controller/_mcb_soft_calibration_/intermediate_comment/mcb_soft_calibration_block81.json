    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for a resetting operation. In particular, it sets the signal `CKE_Train` to low (0) whenever the reset (RST) condition is triggered. This is done to ensure a known and predictable state for the `CKE_Train` signal during reset scenarios, which could be vital for the correct function of the larger system. As the reset condition is detected through the always block, the `CKE_Train` signal is promptly cleared."
