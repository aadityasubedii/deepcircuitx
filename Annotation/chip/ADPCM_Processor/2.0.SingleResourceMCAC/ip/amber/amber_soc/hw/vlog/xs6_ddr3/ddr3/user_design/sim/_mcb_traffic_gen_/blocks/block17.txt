Comment: 
This block updates the end address register on the positive edge of the input clock. It is implemented with an always block that is sensitive to the rising edge (`posedge`) of `clk_i`, which means that every time `clk_i` goes from low to high, the contents of `end_addr_i` are copied into `end_addr_r`.
