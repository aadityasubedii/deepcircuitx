This block of code monitors for a rising edge in the 31st bit of 'dqs_in' signal, representing a positive clock edge detection. Whenever a rising edge is detected on this bit, the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function is triggered with the 31st index. The always block implementation ensures the timing check is continuously monitored and the function is immediately invoked on every detected rising edge.
