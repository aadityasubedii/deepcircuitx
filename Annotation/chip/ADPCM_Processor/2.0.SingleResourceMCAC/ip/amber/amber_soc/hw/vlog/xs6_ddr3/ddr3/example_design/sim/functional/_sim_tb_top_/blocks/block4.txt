This block of code handles a basic system reset operation for a certain application in a Verilog design. Initially, it sets the `c3_sys_rst` signal to a low or '0' state, indicating no reset condition. After a delay of '#20000' time units (which are dependent on the `timescale directive of the module), it then sets the `c3_sys_rst` signal high or '1', thus performing a system-level reset.
