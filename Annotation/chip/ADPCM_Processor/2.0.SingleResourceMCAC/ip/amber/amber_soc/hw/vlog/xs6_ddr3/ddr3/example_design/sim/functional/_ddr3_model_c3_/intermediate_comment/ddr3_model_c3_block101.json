    "block_comment": "This block executes a timing check function with respect to any changes in dq_in[29]. As soon as the 30th bit (with index 29, as in Verilog indexes start from zero) of the dq_in input vector changes, the dq_timing_check function is immediately invoked with the argument of 29, potentially to validate or rectify the timing characteristic of this particular bit."
