    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code defines a wire `core_stall` which indicates if there is any stall in the core. The wire `core_stall` is `high(1)` or `true` when there is a stall in either fetch (`o_fetch_stall`), memory (`i_mem_stall`), execution (`i_exec_stall`), or due to some conflict (`i_conflict`). The operator `||` represents a logical OR operation, implementing a combinational logic that sets `core_stall` to `high` if any of the input conditions trigger a stall.\n"
