Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog can be summarized as follows: "This block performs synchronous reset and latches a retry count value at the positive edge of a master transmission clock, or when a reset signal is received. If the reset signal is high, it sets the latched retry count to zero. Otherwise, when the transmission start-done signal or transmission abort signal is high, it updates the latched retry count with the current retry count."
