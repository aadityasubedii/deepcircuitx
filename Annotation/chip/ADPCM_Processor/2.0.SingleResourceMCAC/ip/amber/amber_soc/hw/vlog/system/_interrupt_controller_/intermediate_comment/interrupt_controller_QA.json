It allows for the enabling and disabling of interrupt requests (IRQs) and fast interrupt requests (FIRQs), as well as the setting and clearing of software interrupts. It interacts with different system components like UARTs, Ethernet MAC, and timers. It supports the Wishbone Bus protocol for its operations including read and write functionalities. Additionally, the module provides support for debugging, allowing the tracing of register access."
