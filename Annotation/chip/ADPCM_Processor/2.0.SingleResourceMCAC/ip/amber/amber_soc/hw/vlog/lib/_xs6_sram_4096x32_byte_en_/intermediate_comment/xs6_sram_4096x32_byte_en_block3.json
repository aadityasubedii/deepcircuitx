    "block_comment": "The block initially designs a memory unit (u_sram4) with no read or write enable, and it's constantly enabled with no reset. The clock is given by i_clk and it writes 8 bits (i_write_data[31:24]) of data into a location specified by a 14-bit address (i_address[10:0], 3'd0). RAMB16BWER block configures a dual-port Block RAM named u_sram5, where several initialization parameters are passed along with other parameters defining data width, reset type, collision checks and target device. The initialization constants appear to be zero (uninitialized), with memory reset operating synchronously with clock, write operating on a read-first basis, and the target being a Spartan6 FPGA device."
