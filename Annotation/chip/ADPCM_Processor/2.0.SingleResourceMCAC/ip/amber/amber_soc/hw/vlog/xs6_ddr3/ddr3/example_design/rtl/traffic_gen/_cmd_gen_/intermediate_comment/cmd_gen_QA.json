It generates memory commands (read, write, refresh) with various addressing modes (fixed, sequential, PRBS) and burst lengths. The module supports different FPGA families (Spartan-6 and Virtex-6) and can be configured for different data widths and memory burst lengths. It includes features like PRBS generation for addresses and instructions, support for different command patterns, and management of read/write buffer availability. The module also handles timing and synchronization of command generation based on input signals and internal counters."
