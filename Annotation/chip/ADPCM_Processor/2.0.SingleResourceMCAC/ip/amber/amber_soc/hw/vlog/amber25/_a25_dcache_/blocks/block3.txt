This block's function is to serve as a debugging error checker for a cache system. Specifically, it checks that data is not simultaneously hit in more than one cache way. In terms of its implementation, it sums the hit signal for each cache way (0-7), and upon every rising edge of the clock, it checks if this sum is greater than 1. If the condition is met, it signifies an error and triggers an TB_ERROR_MESSAGE macro and displays an error message stating "Hit in more than one cache ways!".
