This block enables the functionality and signal assignment related to AXI data transactions based on a configurable setting. If the C_S1_AXI_ENABLE variable is not set, it directly maps the prefixed input signals to their interface counterparts. If enabled, it handles the signal assignments, including address masking for AXI interface, and initiates the instances of both `mcb_ui_top_synch` and `axi_mcb` modules. This also includes connection for each AXI transaction signals, control signals, command and data signals, and error management. Moreover, it manually synchronizes the `calib_done` signal from `mcb_ui_top_synch` module to `axi_mcb` using `axi_mcb_synch`.
