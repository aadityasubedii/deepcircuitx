This block of Verilog code defines an OSERDES2 instance, which is a serializer block for a DDR3 interface. It takes parallel input data, serializes it, and outputs it as high-speed serial data. The configuration is defined by various parameters passed at instantiation including platform-specific parameters and operating modes. The internal system reset (`int_sys_rst`) serves as the reset signal, while `ioclk0` is used as the clock signal. The Data Inputs (`D1`, `D2`) are reset signals that are delayed by 90 degrees (`rst_90`). Other pins of the block are either provided default constant value or left disconnected. This block is generated only if the `C_MEM_TYPE` is equal to "DDR3".
