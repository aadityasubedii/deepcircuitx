The module takes in inputs i_a and i_b with an optional subtraction flag (i_sub) and carry-in (i_cin), then performs either addition or subtraction based on the i_sub flag. The result of the operation is reflected in the output o_sum and the carry-out is reflected in o_co. If the subtract flag is true, subtraction operation takes place otherwise addition does. The WIDTH parameter is configurable, allowing the designer to feed different bit-sized inputs."

Its bit-size is determined by the parameter WIDTH.\n2. i_b [WIDTH-1:0]: This is the second input operand for the addition or subtraction operation. Its bit-size is determined by the parameter WIDTH.\n3. i_cin: This is the input carry which is used for carry-in operations in arithmetic calculations.\n4. i_sub: This is a control signal. If it's set to 1, the operation performed will be subtraction (i_a - i_b), otherwise, it will be an addition operation (i_a + i_b).\n\nOutput ports:\n1. o_sum [WIDTH-1:0]: This is the result of the addition or subtraction operation. Its bit-size is determined by the parameter WIDTH.\n2. o_co: This is the output carry signal. If an addition operation results in a carry or a subtraction operation requires a borrow, this output will be set to 1, otherwise it will be 0. \n\nExplanation:\nThe inputs i_a and i_b are the operands for the arithmetic operations executed by the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) block. The input i_cin is used for carry-in operations that are required in complex arithmetic operations.
