    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a multiplexer for error signals coming from different slave interfaces in a bus system. Based on the value of 'current_slave', it assigns 'master_err' to be the respective error signal from the slave interface the master is currently communicating with. This error signal signifies whether an error has occurred in the communication with the respective slave ('i_sX_wb_err'). If the 'current_slave' index exceeds valid range (4'd0 to 4'd7), default error signal from 'slave 2' is forwarded ('i_s2_wb_err')."
