This block of code is responsible for initializing and updating the RetryLimit register. At every positive edge of MTxClk or Reset, the code checks if a reset condition is true, in which case it sets the RetryLimit register to 0 with some propagation delay denoted by Tp. If a reset is not happening but a transmission has started, marked by either StartTxDone or StartTxAbort being true, it sets RetryLimit to the value of MaxCollisionOccured again with a delay of Tp. The propagation delay ensures synchronous update of the RetryLimit.
