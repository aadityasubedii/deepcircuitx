Comment: 
This block manages states and control signals related to reading from and writing to a cache memory. The `write_state` indicates the different states during which write operations could be performed, and these states apparently relate to cache hit, miss, and idle conditions. `write_stall` and `read_stall` are control signals that are used to hold the write and read operations in certain scenarios, typically when the write or read operations are not ready or the request needs to be held. Conversely, `cache_busy_stall` is a signal that indicates the cache is busy in various states, including turn-around, initial, fill complete, or during a write hit for non-consecutive writes. Generated stalling conditions seem critical in managing pipeline flow and avoiding conflicts.
