    "block_comment": "This block of code loads the input mode to a buffer register on the rising edge of the input clock signal. The block's operation is primarily controlled by the 'mode_load_pulse' signal. When this signal is high, the current input 'bl_mode_i' is loaded into the 'bl_mode_reg' register after a period specified by 'TCQ' to ensure synchronization. In addition, the block also performs double flipping of the 'mode_load_i' input signal with the usage of two sequential registers ('mode_load_d1' and 'mode_load_d2'), aiming to reduce signal noise and distortion."
