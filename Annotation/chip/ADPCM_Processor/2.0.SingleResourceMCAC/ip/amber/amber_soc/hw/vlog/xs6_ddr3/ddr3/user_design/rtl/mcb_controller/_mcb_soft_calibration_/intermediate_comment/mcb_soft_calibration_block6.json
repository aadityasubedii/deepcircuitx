    "block_comment": "The block is performing a conditional operation or comparison between two values, specifically `TARGET_DQS_DELAY` and `DQS_DELAY`. The block assigns the result of this comparison - true or false - to a signal or variable called `Dec_Flag`. If `TARGET_DQS_DELAY` is less than `DQS_DELAY`, `Dec_Flag` will be set to true; otherwise, `Dec_Flag` will be set to false. This conditional assigning of Boolean values could be used in controlling certain later operations or behaviors based on `Dec_Flag`."
