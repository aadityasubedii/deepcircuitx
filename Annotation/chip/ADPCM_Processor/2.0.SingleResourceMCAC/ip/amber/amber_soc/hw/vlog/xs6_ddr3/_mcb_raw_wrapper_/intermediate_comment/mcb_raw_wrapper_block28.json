    "block_comment": "The block of code generates a series of OSERDES2 (Output Serializer/Deserializer) blocks for transforming parallel data (Bank Address) into serial format for each bit of the C_MEM_BANKADDR_WIDTH. This is done through a generate loop in Verilog. The OSERDES block converts two bits of parallel data (D1 and D2, supplied from the ba_90 vector) into serial data. The serial data is clocked out at a rate defined by C_OSERDES2_DATA_RATE_OQ. The conversion operation is synchronized with the signal ioclk0. The reset, clock-enable and other controls are provided from predefined signals. The output of the serializer 'ioi_ba' is connected to the 'ioi_ba' bit array. A key aspect of this implementation is its dynamic generation of OSERDES blocks, which aids in achieving efficient synthesis results for varying memory configurations."
