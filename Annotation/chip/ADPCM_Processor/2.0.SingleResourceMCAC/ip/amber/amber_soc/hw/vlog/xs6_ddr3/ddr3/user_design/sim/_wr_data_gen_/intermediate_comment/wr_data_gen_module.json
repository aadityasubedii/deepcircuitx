    "module": "Module-level comment: This 'wr_data_gen' module generates write data for FPGA devices. It is a parameterized module adaptable for SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 FPGA families. It accepts several inputs like clock, reset, commands, address, burst length etc. and provides outputs including command readiness, last word processing status, write operation completion, data validity and output data. Internal execution is mediated via numerous signals and registers. The module invokes \"sp6_data_gen\" or \"v6_data_gen\" sub-modules based on the specified FPGA family to generate respective data. Its primary function is to ensure dynamic and efficient data handling within FPGA systems."
