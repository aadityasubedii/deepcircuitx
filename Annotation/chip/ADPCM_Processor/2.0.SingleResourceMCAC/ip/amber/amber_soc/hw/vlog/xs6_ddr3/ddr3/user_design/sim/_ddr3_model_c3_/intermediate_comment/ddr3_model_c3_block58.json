    "block_comment": "This statement creates a sensitive/hardware triggering event where at every positive edge of the dqs_in[7] data bit is detected, the function dqs_pos_timing_check(7) is called. It works as a clocking event mechanism to check the data input stream for the proper timing and synchronization. This function ensures that the design complies with the setup and hold-time specifications of the DDR protocol at high speed transfers, improving data sampling accuracy."
