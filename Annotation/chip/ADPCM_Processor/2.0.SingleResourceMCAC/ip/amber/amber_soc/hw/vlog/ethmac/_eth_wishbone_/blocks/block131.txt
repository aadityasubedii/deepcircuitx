This block of code is responsible for creating a boolean condition that determines if the transmission length is less than 4. It accomplishes this by using the 'assign' keyword of Verilog to define 'TxLengthLt4' as a continuous assignment statement that will be updated anytime 'TxLength' changes. The '<' operator compares 'TxLength' to 4 and produces a boolean output, which is then assigned to 'TxLengthLt4'.
