    "block_comment": "This block of code is a delay model for a write enable signal in a memory subsystem. It leverages signal propagation delay concept in Verilog. Whenever there's a change in `we_n`, the write enable signal, the modification is delayed by `BUS_DELAY` time units before being reflected on `we_n_in`, the write enable internal signal to the memory system. This emulates the real-world data bus delay between the memory controller and the memory itself."
