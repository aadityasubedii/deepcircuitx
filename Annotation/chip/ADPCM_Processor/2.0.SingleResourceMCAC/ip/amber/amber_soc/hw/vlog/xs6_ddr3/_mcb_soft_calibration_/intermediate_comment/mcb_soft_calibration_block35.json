    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a part of a finite-state machine (FSM) in Verilog, transitioning to the 'WAIT_FOR_START_BROADCAST' state under a specific set of inputs or conditions. This transition generally indicates that the system is set to a state where it is waiting to begin a broadcast operation. The specific triggers for this state transition are defined within the context not given in this provided code snippet. The `<=` operator is a non-blocking assignment in Verilog used for sequential logic, specifically here for updating the STATE variable."
