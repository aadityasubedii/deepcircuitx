    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a delay functionality using the `always` procedural block in Verilog. Primarily, it introduces a delay equivalent to `BUS_DELAY` to the `cas_n` signal and assigns the delayed value to `cas_n_in`. The delay is incorporated using the `#` operator in the non-blocking assignment. This ensures that signals on buses, which usually have propagation delays, are modeled accurately in the digital system."
