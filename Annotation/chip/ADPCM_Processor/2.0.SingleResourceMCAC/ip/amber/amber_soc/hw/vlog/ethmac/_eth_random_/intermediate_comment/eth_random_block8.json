    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns a value to the 6th bit of the 'Random' vector. It does this by using a conditional (ternary) operator which checks if 'RetryCnt' is greater than 5. If 'RetryCnt' is greater than 5, the 6th bit of 'Random' is assigned the value of the 6th bit of 'x'; otherwise, it is assigned a value of '0'."
