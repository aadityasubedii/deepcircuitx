    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is responsible for identifying violations in timing constraints for the Clock Enable (CKE) input signal. It achieves this through various conditional checks including the reset signal (rst_n_in), input hold time (TIH) and pulse width of input (TIPW). The checks are implemented using '$time' internal function for the simulation time and '$display' function for violation warnings. Errors are displayed when the CKE violates these timing constraints which can be crucial for synchronous digital circuit operation."
