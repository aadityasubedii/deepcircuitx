    "block_comment": "The block serves as a state machine control component in a Verilog RTL design, specifically managing transitions between states based on conditions. It operates by staying in the WAIT2 state if the `IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N` signal is not active, indicating that the system is not ready. However, when the system is ready, the state transitions to either the MULTIPLY_DIVIDE state or the INC_PTERM state. It switches to the former if either the `RZQ_IN` signal is active or the `P_term` value equals binary '111111', otherwise, it transitions to the latter state."
