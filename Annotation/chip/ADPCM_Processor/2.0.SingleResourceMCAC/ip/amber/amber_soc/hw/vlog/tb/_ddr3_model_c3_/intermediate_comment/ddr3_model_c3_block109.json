    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code initiates a data integrity check on a specific bit of a data queue. Whenever any change occurs on the 22nd bit (indexed as 21) of the data queue `dq_in`, this block triggers the `dq_timing_check` function for that bit to ensure its correct timing sequence."
