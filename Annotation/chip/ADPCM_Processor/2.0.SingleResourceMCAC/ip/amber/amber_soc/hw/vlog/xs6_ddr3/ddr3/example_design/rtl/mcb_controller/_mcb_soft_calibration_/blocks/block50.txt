This block of Verilog code is used for configuring the IODRP (I/O data retention programming) operation. The Active_IODRP signal is assigned to ZIO. A valid command is asserted by setting IODRPCTRLR_CMD_VALID to high, followed by providing the memory cell address and writing data through IODRPCTRLR_MEM_CELL_ADDR and IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA assignments respectively. The write mode is chosen by assigning WRITE_MODE to IODRPCTRLR_R_WB. The operation runs only when the IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N condition is true, ensuring that the operation won't start if the controller is busy.
