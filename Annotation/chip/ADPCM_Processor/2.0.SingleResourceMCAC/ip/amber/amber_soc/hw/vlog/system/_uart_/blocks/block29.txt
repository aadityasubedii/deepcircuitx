This block of Verilog code is for managing a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Rx (Receive) queue. Under a high-speed system clock, if FIFO is enabled, the block ensures that new incoming bytes (rx_byte) are added into Rx FIFO (rx_fifo) through write pointer (rx_fifo_wp) if there's still room (rx_fifo_push_not_full); bytes are also removed—using read pointer (rx_fifo_rp)—when data is ready (rx_fifo_pop_not_empty). It maintains FIFO count (rx_fifo_count) based on write and read activities. FIFO full and empty statuses are continuously updated, and an arrival timer (rx_int_timer) is incremented to signal the arrival of new data. However, when FIFO is disabled, the block directly assigns rx_byte to rx_fifo[0], and it alternates full and empty flags when there's a push or pop respectively.
