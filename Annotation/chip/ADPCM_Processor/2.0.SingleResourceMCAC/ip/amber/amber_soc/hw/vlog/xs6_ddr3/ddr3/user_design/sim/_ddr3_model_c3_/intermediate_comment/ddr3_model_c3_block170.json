    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to trigger an event whenever there is a change in the 'ras_n_in' signal. The function 'cmd_addr_timing_check' is called with the argument 1 every time a change occurs in the 'ras_n_in' signal. This procedure tends to ensure the timing checks for command address are carried out whenever the specified conditions are met, providing a mechanism to control the execution sequence in the logic design."
