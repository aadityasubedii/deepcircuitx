This block handles the assignment of interface signals for read, write, and command operations when AXI enable signal (C_S0_AXI_ENABLE) is disabled. It maps inputs to outputs or vice versa for the designated signals which are crucial for handling read, write, and command operationsâ€” involving clock, enable signals, instruction, block lengths, byte address, data, masks, queue statuses (i.e., empty, full), error cases, underflow or overflow situations, and counter values. The assigned values are typically used in other modules or parts of the hardware design for corresponding operations and conditions management.
