    "block_comment": "This code block selects the next way for a 2-way associative cache. If the number of ways (WAYS) is set to 2, a function named 'pick_way' is employed. 'pick_way' takes in valid bits from register ('valid_bits_r') and a generated random number ('random_num') as arguments. The result of this function is then assigned to the 'next_way', indicating the subsequent way to use for cache operations."
