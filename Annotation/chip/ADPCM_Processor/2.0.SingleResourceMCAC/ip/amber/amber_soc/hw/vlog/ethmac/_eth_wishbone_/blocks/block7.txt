This block controls the behaviors of the TxE_IRQ signal, which is likely related to transmission error interrupt requests. At the positive edge of the WB_CLK_I signal or when Reset is high, TxE_IRQ can be altered. Specifically, if reset is active, it sets the TxE_IRQ signal to low. If not reset and both TxStatusWrite and TxIRQEn are high, TxE_IRQ takes the value of TxError. In all other cases, TxE_IRQ is set to low. This block is mainly used for error interrupt control in the data transmission process.
