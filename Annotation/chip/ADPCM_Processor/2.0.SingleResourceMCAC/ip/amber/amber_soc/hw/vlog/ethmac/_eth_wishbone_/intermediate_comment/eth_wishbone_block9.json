    "block_comment": "The block of code is a synchronous reset mechanism for the Wishbone interface clock or the external reset. It implements a two-stage synchronization chain for the 'RxStatusWriteLatched' signal to mitigate potential metastability caused by asynchronous domain crossing. On the triggered rising edge of 'WB_CLK_I' or 'Reset', if 'Reset' is asserted, the code initializes the synchronization chain 'RxStatusWriteLatched_syncb1' and 'RxStatusWriteLatched_syncb2' to zero. Otherwise, the chain stages are updated sequentially, for synchronizing 'RxStatusWriteLatched' signal to the local clock domain."
