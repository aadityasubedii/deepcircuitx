Module name: v6_data_gen. Module specification: The v6_data_gen module is a versatile data generator for memory testing and simulation purposes. It generates various data patterns including address-based, PRBS (pseudo-random binary sequence), walking 1/0, neighbor, and fixed patterns. The module takes inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), data mode (data_mode_i), address (addr_i), and control signals (cmd_startA-E), and outputs generated data (data_o). It supports different data widths and burst lengths, making it adaptable for various memory configurations. Internally, it uses signals like prbs_data, acounts, adata, hdata, ndata, and w1data to generate and manipulate different data patterns. The module is divided into several blocks, including pattern generation logic for different modes (e.g., PRBS,
