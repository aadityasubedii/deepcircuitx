This block is designed for verifying the reception of a Unicast frame in an Ethernet MAC. When a frame is received, the block compares the MAC destination address of the frame with the MAC of the device. If the MAC addresses match and no reception errors occur (RxAbort), or if it's the end of the frame (RxEndFrm), the UnicastOK signal is set. This comparison is done on the rising edge of the MRxClk or reset signals, where the Reset action sets UnicastOK to 0, while the RxCheckEn flag and ByteCntEqX enable the comparison of parts of RxData with MAC.
