    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code ensures the effective control of the Receive (Rx) Enable Window based on certain inputs. The function occurs at the positive edge of the MRxClk clock signal or when a reset signal is triggered. If the reset condition is true, the RxEnableWindow is disabled (0). If a 'frame start' signal (RxStartFrm) is detected, RxEnableWindow is enabled (1). Conversely, if a 'frame end' signal (RxEndFrm) or an 'abort' command (RxAbort) is detected, the RxEnableWindow is again disabled. The execution of these actions depends on the transitive propagation delay (Tp)."
