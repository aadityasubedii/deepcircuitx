Explanation: This module implements a register bank for a processing core (presumably from the ARM25 family given the naming convention). It is responsible for register read and write operations, handles mode changes and interrupts, and manages stall conditions from the core and memory operations. The register bank consists of user registers and banked registers for various modes of operation, including supervisor mode, interrupt mode, and fast interrupt mode. The module also consists of write enable lines for individual registers and program counter update logic."
