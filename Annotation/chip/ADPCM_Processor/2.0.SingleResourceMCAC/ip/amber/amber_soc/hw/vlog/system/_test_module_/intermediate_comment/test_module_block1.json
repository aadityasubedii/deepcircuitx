    "block_comment": "This block of code updates the UART control and TXD registers using the Wishbone bus interface. When a write request is received (`wb_start_write`) and the address matches the UART control register (`i_wb_adr[15:0] == AMBER_TEST_UART_CONTROL`), the control register (`tb_uart_control_reg`) is updated with the low 2 bits of the 32-bit write data (`wb_wdata32[1:0]`). Similarly, when another write request is directed at the UART TXD register (`i_wb_adr[15:0] == AMBER_TEST_UART_TXD`), the TXD register (`tb_uart_txd_reg`) is updated with the low 8 bits of the write data (`wb_wdata32[7:0]`) and the state of the `tb_uart_push` signal is flipped."
