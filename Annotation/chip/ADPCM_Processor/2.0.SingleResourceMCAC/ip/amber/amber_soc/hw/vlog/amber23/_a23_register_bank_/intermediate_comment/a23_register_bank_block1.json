    "block_comment": "I apologize for the confusion, however, the provided input does not contain any Verilog code except for the `endmodule` keyword indicating the end of a module. To provide an accurate summary of a block of Verilog code, I would need a complete module or logic block with inputs, outputs, and procedural descriptions. Could you please provide a complete Verilog code that I can summarize?"
