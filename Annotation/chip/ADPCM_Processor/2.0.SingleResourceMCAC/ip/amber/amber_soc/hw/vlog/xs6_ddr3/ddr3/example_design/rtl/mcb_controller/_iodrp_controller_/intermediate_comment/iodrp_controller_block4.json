    "block_comment": "This block handles DRP (Dynamic Reconfiguration Port) signals timing. It's triggered by the positive edge of the DRP_CLK signal, meaning actions within this block are carried out on each rising moment of the DRP_CLK. Specific DRP signals (DRP_ADD, DRP_CS and DRP_BKST) are manipulated depending on the current state of the system. The DRP_ADD and DRP_CS signals are modified during the ADDR_PHASE and DATA_PHASE respectively. In the READY state, it determines whether to use broadcast, setting the DRP_BKST to the value of use_broadcast."
