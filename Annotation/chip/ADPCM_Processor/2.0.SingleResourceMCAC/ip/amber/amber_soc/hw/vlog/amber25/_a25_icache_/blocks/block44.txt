This block stores the write-back (WB) address for a specific condition. It checks in each clock cycle, if the WB request 'o_wb_req' is active, then it captures the current 'i_address'. Otherwise, if both the 'i_wb_ready' and 'fill_state' are true, it then increments the bits from 2 to 3 of the current 'wb_address' and appends '2'd0' to the lower end, maintaining the rest of the WB address same.
