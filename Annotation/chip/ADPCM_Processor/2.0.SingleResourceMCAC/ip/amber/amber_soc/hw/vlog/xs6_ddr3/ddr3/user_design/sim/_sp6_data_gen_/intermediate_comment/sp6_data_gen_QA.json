This includes walking, hammer, address, and pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) data patterns, amongst others. The specific data pattern and bit-width (DWIDTH) can be adjusted via input parameters. Inputs and outputs are also parameterized, giving the module flexibility. Control signals such as start commands, reset, and clock are also factored in.

The module's functionality depends on this clock.\n2. rst_i: This is the reset signal input to the module. If true, it resets the state of the module.\n3. prbs_fseed_i: This is the initial seed value for the pseudo-random binary sequence data pattern.\n4. data_mode_i and data_rdy_i: Data mode controls the type of data pattern to be generated.\n5. cmd_startA-E: This series of command signals are used to control the start of different operations within the module (although from the code it seems only cmd_startC and cmd_startE are used).\n6. fixed_data_i: This input serves as the data basis when creating fixed data patterns.\n7. addr_i: This is input address for address-based data patterns.\n8. user_burst_cnt: This input controls the number of burst operations to execute.\n9. fifo_rdy_i: This input signal specifies whether the FIFO (First In, First Out) queue is ready.\n\nOutput ports:\n1. data_o: This is the output data from the module. Depending on the parameters and input signals given to the module, this will contain one of several possible data patterns (set by data_mode_i). This is an output since it is the final result after processing the inputs according to the specified pattern.\n\nExplanation: All input ports play different roles in determining the behavior of the data generation - they control the type of data pattern, set the initial conditions for that pattern, and trigger different actions (like resetting or starting data processing). The output port data_o provides the result of these operations."
