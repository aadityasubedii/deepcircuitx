    "block_comment": "The provided block of Verilog code defines a task named `fwrite_hex_drop_zeros` that writes a hexadecimal number to a file while dropping leading zeros. This task takes a 32-bit file descriptor and a 32-bit hexadecimal number as input parameters. If the high-order nibble (4 bits) of the number is not zero, it writes the entire number. Otherwise, it checks the next lower nibble. This process of checking continues, decrementing the range of bits to be checked and to be written by 4 (a nibble) until a non-zero nibble is encountered. Eventually, the task writes the hexadecimal number to the file without leading zeros."
