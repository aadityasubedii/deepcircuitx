This block of code is responsible for ensuring that the signal 'dm_in[14]' follows the required timing conditions. It does so by calling the `dm_timing_check` procedure every time there is a change in the state of `dm_in[14]`. The argument passed to the procedure indicates the index of the signal being monitored, in this case, 14th index of the 'dm_in' array.
