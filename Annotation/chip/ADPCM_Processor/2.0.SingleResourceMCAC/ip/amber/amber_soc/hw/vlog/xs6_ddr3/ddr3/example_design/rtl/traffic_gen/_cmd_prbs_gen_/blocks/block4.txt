Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is part of a generate-conditional statement which essentially is a PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) generator control block. This block is only activated when `PRBS_CMD` is equal to "INSTR" or "BLEN". It uses an edge-triggered always block, meaning that the actions inside this block are executed whenever there is a rising edge in the `clk_i` signal.
