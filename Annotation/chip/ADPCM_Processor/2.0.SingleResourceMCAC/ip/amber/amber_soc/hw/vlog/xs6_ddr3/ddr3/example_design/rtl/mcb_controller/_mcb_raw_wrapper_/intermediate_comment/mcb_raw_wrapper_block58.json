    "block_comment": "This block sets up the control and data signals for a 32-bit read-only port with index 5. It first assigns default low ('b0) to various signals associated with the port. If the 5th port is enabled and configured for 32-bit read operation (R32, specified via the C_PORT_CONFIG array), it maps the MIG (Memory Interface Generator) signals with corresponding port signals. The MIG provides FIFO control signals like enable, overflow, full, empty and count signals, which are involved in managing memory traffic to the read port. Furthermore, it also assigns data signals from MIG to the port for reading data."
