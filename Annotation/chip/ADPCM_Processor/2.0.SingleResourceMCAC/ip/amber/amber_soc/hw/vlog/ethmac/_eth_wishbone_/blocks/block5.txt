Comment: 
This block represents an interrupt service routine for dealing with RX errors in a data communication system. The routine gets triggered on a positive edge of the Write Back Clock (WB_CLK_I) or when the Reset signal is high. On a reset event, the interrupt request (RxE_IRQ) is cleared. During operation, if a RX status is being written (RxStatusWrite) and interrupts are enabled (RxIRQEn) and either no pause frame was received or a frame was received during a 'pass all' condition and the RX flow wasn't interrupted (i.e., no RX flow control), an error flag (RxError) is raised. Otherwise, the interrupt request is cleared.
