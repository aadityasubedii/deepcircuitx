Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for instantiating either a 32-bit or a 128-bit boot memory module based on the value of the Wishbone data width (WB_DWIDTH). Depending on the WB_DWIDTH, it selects between two separate implementations of boot memory: boot_mem32 for 32 bits and boot_mem128 for 128 bits. Each instantiation ties the necessary input-output pins like the system clock sys_clk, Wishbone address, select, write enable, read/write data, cycle, strobe signals, and the acknowledgment and error signals for the respective Wishbone bus. These signals are then used to facilitate the read and write operations in the boot memory module.
