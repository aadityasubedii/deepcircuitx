Module-level comment: This module generates various data patterns (walking, hammer, address, PRBS) for testing purposes. It uses parameterized inputs to select the pattern type and bit-width. The module implements pattern-specific generation logic, including counters for walking patterns, fixed patterns for hammer, address incrementing, and a PRBS generator. Output data is selected based on the input data mode and processed according to the chosen pattern, providing flexible test data generation for different hardware design scenarios.
