This block of code represents a state in a finite state machine (FSM). Specifically, it manages flow control under the state 'UDQS_WAIT1', awaiting signals from a memory controller block (MCB). If 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N' remains deasserted, which signifies the MCB is busy, the FSM stays in the current 'UDQS_WAIT1' state. However, if 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N' is asserted, indicating the MCB is ready and not busy, the FSM transitions to the 'UDQS_WRITE_NEG_INDELAY' state.
