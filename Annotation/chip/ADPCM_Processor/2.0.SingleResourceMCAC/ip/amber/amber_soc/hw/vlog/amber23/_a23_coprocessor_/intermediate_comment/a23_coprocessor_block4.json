    "block_comment": "This block of code handles data latch under certain conditions in a synchronous design. On the rising edge of the input clock signal (`i_clk`), if the input fetch stall signal (`i_fetch_stall`) is not asserted, the input data related to co-processor operation (`i_copro_operation`) and register number (`i_copro_crn`) are latched into one-stage delay elements (`copro_operation_d1` and `copro_crn_d1` respectively). The latched data can then be used in the subsequent clock cycle."
