Module-level comment: 
/*
This module (memc_wrapper) provides a wrapper for a memory controller (MCB) interface, 
supporting up to 6 ports for memory access with both standard and AXI interfaces. 
It configures and manages memory operations for various types (e.g., DDR3), 
handling timing, calibration, and data transfer. The module instantiates mcb_ui_top 
to implement core memory controller functionality, while providing a standardized 
interface for system components to interact with the memory subsystem.
