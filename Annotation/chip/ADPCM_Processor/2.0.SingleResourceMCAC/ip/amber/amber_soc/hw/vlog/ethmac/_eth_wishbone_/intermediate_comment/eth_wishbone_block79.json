    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for managing the transmission byte count (TxByteCnt) in a communication interface module. It resets TxByteCnt with the rising edge of Reset or alters its value based on the signals like TxAbort_q, TxRetry_q, TxStartFrm, TxUsedData, and TxPointerLSB. When reset or specific abort/retry conditions are detected, the count resets. At the start of a frame, if there is no used data, TxPointerLSB defines the initial count as 1, 2, or 3. For used data and a high \u2018Flop' signal, the count increments."
