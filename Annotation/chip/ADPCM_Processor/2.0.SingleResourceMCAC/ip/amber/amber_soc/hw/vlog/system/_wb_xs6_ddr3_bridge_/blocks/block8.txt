Comment: 
This block is responsible for controlling the write enable signal `o_wr_en` for a particular system or device. It does this by logically ANDing the delayed write enable signal `wr_en_r` with the logical negation of the `i_cmd_full` input signal. By this, the write operation is only enabled when there is a write request (`wr_en_r` is true) and the command queue is not full (`i_cmd_full` is false).
