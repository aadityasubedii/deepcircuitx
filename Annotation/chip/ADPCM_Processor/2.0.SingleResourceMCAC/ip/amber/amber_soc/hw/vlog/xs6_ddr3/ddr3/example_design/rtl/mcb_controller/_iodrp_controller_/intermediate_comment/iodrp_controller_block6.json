    "block_comment": "This block operates on the rising edge of DRP_CLK. It ensures if there is a synchronous reset, it sets the `read_data` variable to 8 low-valued bits ('h00). If there isn't a reset, it checks the `state` to see if it equals `ALMOST_READY`, if so, the `read_data` is replaced with the content from `shift_through_reg`. The block essentially reads and updates the `read_data` variable based on the system's state and `shift_through_reg`."
