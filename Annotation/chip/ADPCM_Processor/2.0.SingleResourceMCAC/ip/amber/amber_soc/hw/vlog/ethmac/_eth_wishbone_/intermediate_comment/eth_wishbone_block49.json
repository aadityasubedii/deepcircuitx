    "block_comment": "This Verilog code is a sequential logic block responsible for managing the signal 'ShiftWillEnd'. The block responds to a rising edge of either the MRxClk clock signal or the Reset signal. If the Reset signal or the condition (ShiftEnded_rck | RxAbort) is true, 'ShiftWillEnd' is asynchronously set to 0 with a delay specified by 'Tp'. If the 'StartShiftWillEnd' condition is true, 'ShiftWillEnd' is asynchronously set to 1 after a 'Tp' delay. Thus, based on certain conditions, this block controls the state of 'ShiftWillEnd'."
