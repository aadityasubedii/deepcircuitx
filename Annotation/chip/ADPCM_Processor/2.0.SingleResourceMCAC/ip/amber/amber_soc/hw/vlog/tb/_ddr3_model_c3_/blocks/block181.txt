This block is a single-line Verilog RTL code that triggers an action at the rising edge of the signal 'dqs_odd[10]'. Specifically, when the 10th bit of the 'dqs_odd' signal transitions from low to high, the function 'dqs_odd_receiver' is called with '10' as an argument. The 'always @ (posedge ...)' construct is a common Verilog idiom for defining actions that should occur on the rising edge of a clock signal, and in this case, it is being used to implement the real-time reception of data on the 'dqs_odd' signal.
