Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code declares two wire variables, `xTXD_STATE` and `xRXD_STATE`. They are defined to hold multiple bytes of information, 10 bytes and 14 bytes respectively. Each byte consists of 8 bits, hence the bit widths of the wires are multiples of 8. The bit indexing is such that the MSB corresponds to the highest bit position (either `10*8-1` or `14*8-1`), which is typical in Verilog. `xTXD_STATE` is used for transmitting data whereas `xRXD_STATE` is used for receiving data, as denoted by TX and RX in their names respectively. 

This kind of coding style is commonly used for communication protocols where you have TX and RX data paths, which work independently but often concurrently.
