Module-level comment: 
/**
 * This module implements a 4096x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using 8 RAMB16BWER primitives
 * on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. It provides a 32-bit wide memory with 4096 addresses, supporting byte-level 
 * write operations. The module uses a single clock domain for both read and write operations, with 
 * configurable initial values for each BRAM block. It splits the memory into lower and upper halves,
 * each managed by 4 BRAM blocks, to achieve the desired capacity and byte-write capability.
