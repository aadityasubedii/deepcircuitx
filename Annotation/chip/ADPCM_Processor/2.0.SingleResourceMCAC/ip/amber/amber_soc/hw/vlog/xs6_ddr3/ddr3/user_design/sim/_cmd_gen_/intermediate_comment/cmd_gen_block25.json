    "block_comment": "This block of code is implementing a comparison operation to detect if the current address has reached or passed the end address. The code compares the upper byte of the address output with the upper byte of the end address, then sets the corresponding output bit if the current address has reached or exceeded the end address. This pattern is repeated three times for three different byte locations of the address (31:24, 23:16, 15:8). The output bits \"AC3_G_E3\", \"AC2_G_E2\", and \"AC1_G_E1\" are asynchronously set active high when the condition is true, using a delay defined by \"TCQ\"."
