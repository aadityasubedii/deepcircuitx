    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a counter that increments on each positive edge of the DRP_CLK signal. The counter is only incremented when the 'state' is either in the ADDR_PHASE or DATA_PHASE and the 'sync_rst' is not active. If these conditions are not met, the counter 'bit_cnt' is reset."
