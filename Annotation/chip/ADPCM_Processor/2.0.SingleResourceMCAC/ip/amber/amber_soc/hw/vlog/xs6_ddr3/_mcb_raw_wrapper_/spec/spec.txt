Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: The mcb_raw_wrapper module is a Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface wrapper designed to handle various DDR memory types (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, LPDDR). It provides a configurable interface between user logic and the memory controller, supporting different port configurations, data widths, and memory parameters. The module includes numerous input ports for clocks, control signals, commands, and data for up to six memory ports, as well as output ports for status signals, data, and memory interface connections. Key internal signals include clock and reset management, calibration signals, and data path controls. The module is structured with several main sections: port configuration logic, address mapping, data read/write operations, and IOB (Input/Output Block) instantiations for interfacing with physical memory. It incorporates IODRP2 (I/O Digital Rec
