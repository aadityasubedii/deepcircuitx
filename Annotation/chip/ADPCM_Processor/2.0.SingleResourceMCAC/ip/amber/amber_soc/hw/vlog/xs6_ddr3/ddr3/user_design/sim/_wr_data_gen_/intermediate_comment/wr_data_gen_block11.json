    "block_comment": "The block performs a logical AND operation on two signals 'cmd_rdy' and 'fifo_not_full'. It assigns the output of this operation to the signal 'cmd_rdy_o'. The purpose of this block is to indicate that the system/command is ready to accept new data when it is not full to prevent overflow issues. The implementation accomplishes this by using a logical AND operation to ensure both conditions ('cmd_rdy' & 'fifo_not_full') are met."
