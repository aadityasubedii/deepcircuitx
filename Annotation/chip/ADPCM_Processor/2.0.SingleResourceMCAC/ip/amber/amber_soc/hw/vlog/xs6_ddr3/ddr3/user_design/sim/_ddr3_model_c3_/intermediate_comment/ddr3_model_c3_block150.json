    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a check on the timing of the command address. Specifically, it is an always block in Verilog which executes the `cmd_addr_timing_check()` function whenever there is a change in the 15th bit (bit index 14) of the `addr_in` signal (which seems to be an address input signal). This function takes an integer parameter `21`, which probably corresponds to a specific check or configuration within the function. The purpose of this block is to monitor changes in the specific part of the address signal and perform necessary timing checks."
