This block of code is responsible for memory management in a Verilog hardware design. It enables memory operations via the Wishbone protocol with a specific data width (WB_DWIDTH) and select width (WB_SWIDTH). The module `main_mem` manages these operations, wherein various signals are used for handling memory access. Signals `s_wb_adr` and `s_wb_sel` are input to the memory for addressing and selecting data. `s_wb_we` is utilized to enable write operations. The module handles data input and output with `s_wb_dat_w` and `s_wb_dat_r` respectively. Signals `s_wb_cyc` and `s_wb_stb` control the memory transaction cycle, while `s_wb_ack` and `s_wb_err` provide feedback on the transaction.
