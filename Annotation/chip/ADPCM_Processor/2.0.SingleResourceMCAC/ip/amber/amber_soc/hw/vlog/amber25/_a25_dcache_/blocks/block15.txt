The function "pick_way" serves to select a 'way' based on input validity bits and a random number. It prioritizes the selection of the least valid bit first. If all are valid, a random number is used to pick the way. It compares each bit of the valid_bits input to 0, starting from bit 0 to bit 3. If the bit is 0, the corresponding bit in the pick_way output is set to 1. If all bits are valid (1's), a case statement is used to select the way based on the binary selection of the random_num input.
