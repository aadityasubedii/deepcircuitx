Comment: 
The block represents a flip-flop element which records and manages data validity and detected errors in a data quantum (DQ) lane of a digital circuit. On each clock (clk_i) positive edge, it resets DQ error flags and the data validity flag if either the reset input (rst_i[1]) or a manual error clear signal is activated. During normal operation (neither reset nor clear are active), it records recent DQ lane error (dq_lane_error) and data validity (data_valid_i) statuses, while accumulatively registering DQ lane errors. Signals are delayed by a time constant (TCQ) to ensure synchronous operation within the digital system. The block specifically works with timing and error management in data processing circuits.
