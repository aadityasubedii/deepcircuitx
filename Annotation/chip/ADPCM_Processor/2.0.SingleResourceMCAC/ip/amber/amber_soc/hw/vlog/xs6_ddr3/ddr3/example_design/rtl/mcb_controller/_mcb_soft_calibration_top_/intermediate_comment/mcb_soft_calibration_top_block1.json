    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional memory type generator associated with DDR (Double Data Rate) types. It creates input-output buffers (IOBUF) and Input/Output Digitally Controlled Impedance input buffers (IODRP2) when the memory type is DDR, DDR2, or DDR3 and the skip input termination calibration flag (SKIP_IN_TERM_CAL) is set to 0. IOBUF takes care of bi-directional data flow with a control signal while IODRP2 buffers are designed for digital impedance control, enabling precise control of drive strength and impedance. It allows the user to alter the drive strength and impedance of the IOs dynamically. The model synchronizes these operations with UI and IO clocks and uses a range of input, output and control signals."
