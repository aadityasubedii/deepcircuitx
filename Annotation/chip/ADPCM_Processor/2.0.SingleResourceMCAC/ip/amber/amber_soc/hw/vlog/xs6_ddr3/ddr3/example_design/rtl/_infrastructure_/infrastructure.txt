Module-level comment: The 'infrastructure' module provides a clocking mechanism and synchronized reset infrastructure for a digital system. It uses differential/single-ended system clocks and reset signal as inputs to generate various clock frequencies and reset signals. The module leverages a Phase-locked Loop (PLL) and clock buffers (BUFG, BUFGCE) to generate and distribute several clock signals with minimal skew. It synchronizes reset signals to relevant clocks to prevent metastability. A Multi-Controller Bus (MCB) buffer facilitates strobe and clock signals to the FPGA as well.
