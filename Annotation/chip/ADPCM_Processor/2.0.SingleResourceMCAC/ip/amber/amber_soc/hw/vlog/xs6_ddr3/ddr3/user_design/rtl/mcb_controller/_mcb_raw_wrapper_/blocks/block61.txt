This block is responsible for two main functionalities, reading and writing with some conditions. When C_PORT_CONFIG[183:160] is "B32" and C_PORT_CONFIG[87:64] "R32", and C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is asserted, the block facilitates read operations by assigning the value of different mig_p3 related signals to corresponding p3_rd signals. If C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is not asserted, the relevant p3_rd signals and mig_p3 signals are set to 0. On the other hand, if C_PORT_CONFIG[183:160] is "B32" and C_PORT_CONFIG[55:32] "W32" and C_PORT_ENABLE[4] is asserted, it allows write operations by assigning values of p4_wr signals to mig_p4 signals and others. If the condition is not matched, relevant signals are assigned to 'b0.
