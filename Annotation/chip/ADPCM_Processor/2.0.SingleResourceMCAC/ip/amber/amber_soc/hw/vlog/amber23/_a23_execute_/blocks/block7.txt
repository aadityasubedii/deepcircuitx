Comment: 
This block of code represents a barrel shifter module that performs shift operations in RTL designs. The module is a multi bit parallel shift register, implemented with the help of `a23_barrel_shift` or `a23_barrel_shift_fpga` instances based on conditions. It receives input parameters from external sources which include data input `i_in`, shift amount `i_shift_amount`, carry-in data `i_carry_in`, zero-shift indicator `i_shift_imm_zero`, and shift function `i_function`. These input signals determine the shift operation performed. The results of the shift operation and the carry out value are provided as `o_out` and `o_carry_out`, respectively.
