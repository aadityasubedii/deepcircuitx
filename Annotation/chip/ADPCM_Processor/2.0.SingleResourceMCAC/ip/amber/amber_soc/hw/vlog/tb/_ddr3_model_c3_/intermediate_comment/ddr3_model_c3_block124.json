    "block_comment": "This block of code uses a hardware event-driven approach for timing check in Verilog. The always block in Verilog reacts to changes on the signal `dq_in[6]`. When the 7th element in the `dq_in` array changes (remember, indexing in Verilog starts from 0, so index 6 refers to the seventh position), the function `dq_timing_check(6)` is triggered for execution. The purpose of this block is to provide a responsive mechanism for timing check whenever there is a change in the specific signal. It narrates the functional behaviour of the `dq_in[6]` bit of the input array with regards to the timing checks."
