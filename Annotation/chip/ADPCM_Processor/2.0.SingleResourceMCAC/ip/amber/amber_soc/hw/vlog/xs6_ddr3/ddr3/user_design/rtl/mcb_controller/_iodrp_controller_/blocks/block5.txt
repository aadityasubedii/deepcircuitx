Comment: 
This block of code controls the address phase of a certain process in a synchronous digital system. The control flow is driven by a positive clock edge. If a system reset (`sync_rst`) occurs, the address phase is reset to 0. Absent a reset, the address phase's behavior depends on its current value and the states of two other variables: `state` and `bit_cnt`. If `AddressPhase` is high, it will remain high until the system enters an 'ALMOST_READY' state. If `AddressPhase` is low, it will go high if the system is in the 'ADDR_PHASE' state and `bit_cnt` equals 7 (binary '111').
