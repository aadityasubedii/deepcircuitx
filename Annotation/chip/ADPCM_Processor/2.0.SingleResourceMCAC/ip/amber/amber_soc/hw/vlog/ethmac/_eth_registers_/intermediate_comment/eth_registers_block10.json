    "block_comment": "The block of code is dedicated to managing the reset condition in a synchronous digital system. It ensures that a reset of the RxCIrq signal occurs only in synchrony with the rising edge of the 'RxClk' clock signal or a positive edge reset. The block operates sequentially, when a reset is signalled it sets 'ResetRxCIrq_sync3' to '0', else on the following clock edges, 'ResetRxCIrq_sync3' adopts the value of 'ResetRxCIrq_sync2'. The delay '#Tp' grid ensures that the assignment is nonblocking, which allows the system to handle other processes concurrently."
