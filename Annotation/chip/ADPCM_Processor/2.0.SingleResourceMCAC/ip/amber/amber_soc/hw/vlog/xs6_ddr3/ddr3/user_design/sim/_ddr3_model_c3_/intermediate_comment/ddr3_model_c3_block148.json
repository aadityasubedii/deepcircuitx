    "block_comment": "The block of code is a task in Verilog of checking the data transfer timing. This task checks for potential timing violations on data mask (DM) signals in a DDR transmission protocol. If a violation is observed, an error message is printed. It decides this by examining the time difference between the current time and the time of the last data strobe (DQS) signal, if this is less than the hold time (TDH), a tDH violation is identified. Additionally, it performs a check on DM based on a single flag (check_dm_tdipw[i]) to find tDIPW violations, by checking if the time since the last DM bit was set is less than TDIPW. Post these checks, the mask flag is reset and the time of last DM is updated."
