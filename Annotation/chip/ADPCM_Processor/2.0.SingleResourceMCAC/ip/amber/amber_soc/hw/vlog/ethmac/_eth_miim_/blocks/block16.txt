This block performs the function of a control module in a Verilog digital system where it handles write control and read status signals upon positive edge of the clock cycle or whenever a reset is triggered. Upon a reset, it clears 'WCtrlDataStart', 'WCtrlDataStart_q', and 'RStatStart'. If 'EndBusy' is asserted, 'WCtrlDataStart' and 'RStatStart' are cleared. In other cases, the block sets 'WCtrlDataStart' and 'RStatStart', if there are pending write control data and read status respectively, by checking 'WCtrlData_q2' and 'RStat_q2'. Lastly, it latches the 'WCtrlDataStart' signal value into 'WCtrlDataStart_q' for future use.
