    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling data writing into a FIFO buffer. The process occurs at the positive edge of the clock cycle and primarily handles two conditions. If the write and clear signals are both active, it writes the input data to the first index of the FIFO buffer with a delay of Tp units. Meanwhile, if the write signal is active and the FIFO buffer is not full, it writes the input data to the position indicated by the write_pointer, also with a delay of Tp."
