    "block_comment": "This block is a sensitivity list that triggers `cmd_addr_timing_check(14)` whenever there's a change in the bit at position 7 of `addr_in`. The block utilizes an 'always' procedural block, common in Verilog, which is executed whenever the value of `addr_in[7]` changes, therefore enhancing the efficiency of monitoring changes in the specific bit of the address input."
