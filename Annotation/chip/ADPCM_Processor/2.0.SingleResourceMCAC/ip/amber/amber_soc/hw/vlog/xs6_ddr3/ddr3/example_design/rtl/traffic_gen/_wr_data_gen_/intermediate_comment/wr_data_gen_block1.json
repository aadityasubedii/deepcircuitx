    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional instantiation of the v6_data_gen module based on the family type (VIRTEX6 specified). The v6_data_gen module is configured with parameters that include timings (TCQ), data width (DWIDTH), address and column widths, data pattern, burst length, and other settings. It interfaces with the rest of the system through clock and reset signals, ready signal indicating data readiness, a PRBS free running seed signal, Start commands for multiple threads, an address signal, a fixed data signal, a user burst count signal, and a FIFO ready signal indicating FIFO not being full. The instantiated module generates data output according to the provided parameters and signals."
