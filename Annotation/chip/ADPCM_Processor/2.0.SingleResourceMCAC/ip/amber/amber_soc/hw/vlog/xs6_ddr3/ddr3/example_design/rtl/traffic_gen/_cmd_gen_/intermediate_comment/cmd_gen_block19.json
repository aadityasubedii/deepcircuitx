    "block_comment": "Your Verilog code snippet is not complete. Could you provide a full block of Verilog code? It would need to contain at least a beginning and end of an implementation for me to provide an accurate and concise description of its functions and implementation. Here\u2019s an example structure:\n\n```verilog\nmodule SomeModule (input wire a, input wire b, output reg c);\n  assign c = a & b;\nendmodule\n```\nIn this example, a brief description would be:\n\n\"This module logically ANDs 'a' and 'b' inputs to generate the 'c' output. The logic operation is implemented using the 'assign' keyword and the '&' operator.\" \n\nPlease provide a complete code block so I could generate an appropriate comment."
