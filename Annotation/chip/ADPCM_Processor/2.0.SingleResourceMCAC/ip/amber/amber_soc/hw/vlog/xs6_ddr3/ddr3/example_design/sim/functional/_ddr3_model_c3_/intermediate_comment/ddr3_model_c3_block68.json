    "block_comment": "The code block functions as a monitoring system that triggers a timing check whenever the 63rd bit of the input data vector, `dq_in`, changes. It uses an always block to continuously monitor the bit of interest, and upon its change, the procedure `dq_timing_check()` with the bit index as an argument (here 62) is invoked to perform the timing analysis for that bit."
