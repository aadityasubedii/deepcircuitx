    "block_comment": "The function more_to_come determines if there are more registers to process. It takes a 16-bit register array and a 32-bit integer as inputs. Based on the value of the input integer 'i', it performs bitwise OR operations on segments of the register array and assigns the result to the 'more_to_come' function. If even one bit is set in the chosen register segment, the result will be '1', signalling that there are more registers to be processed. Otherwise, the result is '0'. The segments of the array get smaller with decreasing 'i' value, thereby simulating the processing of registers."
