    "block_comment": "The provided block of code is a data generator that generates data 'w1data' based on the input address (addr_i) and data mode (data_mode_i) on clock's positive edge. Upon a start command (cmd_startC) or a ready signal from the FIFO (fifo_rdy_i), the code utilizes a case structure to generate multiple potential data patterns based on the upper 4 bits of the input address. The data's generation depends on the data_mode_i, if it equals to '4b0101', a function Data_Gen is used with the address's upper bits as an input. Otherwise, function Data_GenW0 is used. For the special case where the memory burst length (MEM_BURST_LEN) is 8, the design breaks down the generated data into 4 segments and arranges them as required."
