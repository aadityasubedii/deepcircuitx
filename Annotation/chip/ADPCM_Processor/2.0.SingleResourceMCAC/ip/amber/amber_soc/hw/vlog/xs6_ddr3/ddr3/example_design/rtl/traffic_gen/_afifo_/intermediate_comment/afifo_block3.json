    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the available buffer size of a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) memory. It calculates the available buffer size by adding the FIFO_DEPTH (the maximum size of the FIFO) to the current read pointer position `rd_capture_ptr` and subtracting the current write pointer position `wr_ptr`. In this way, it implements dynamic buffer monitoring, ensuring efficient use of the FIFO memory space."
