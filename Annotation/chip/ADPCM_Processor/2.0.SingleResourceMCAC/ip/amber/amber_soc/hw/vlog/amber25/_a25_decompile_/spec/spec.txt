Module name: a25_decompile. Module specification: The a25_decompile module is designed to decompile ARM processor instructions for debugging and analysis purposes. It takes various input signals related to instruction execution, including clock (i_clk), core stall (i_core_stall), 32-bit instruction (i_instruction), instruction validity (i_instruction_valid), undefined instruction flag (i_instruction_undefined), execution flag (i_instruction_execute), interrupt type (i_interrupt), interrupt state (i_interrupt_state), instruction address (i_instruction_address), program counter select (i_pc_sel), and program counter write enable (i_pc_wen). The module doesn't have explicit output ports; instead, it writes decompiled instruction traces to a file specified by the A25_DECOMPILE_FILE macro. Internally, the module uses numerous signals for instruction decoding and formatting
