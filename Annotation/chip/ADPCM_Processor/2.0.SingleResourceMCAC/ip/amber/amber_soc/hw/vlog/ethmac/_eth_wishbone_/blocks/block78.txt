Comment: 
This synchronous block controls the reading of data from a FIFO buffer in a transmission process. When the system is reset, 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_tck' is set to 0. Alternatively, under certain conditions related to starting a frame transmission, using data, setting a flop, and a byte count, 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_tck' will be set to 1, which implies that data is ready to be read from the FIFO. If the read process is already in progress and there is a lag between the second and third synchronizations, 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_tck' will be set back to 0, halting the reading process from the FIFO.
