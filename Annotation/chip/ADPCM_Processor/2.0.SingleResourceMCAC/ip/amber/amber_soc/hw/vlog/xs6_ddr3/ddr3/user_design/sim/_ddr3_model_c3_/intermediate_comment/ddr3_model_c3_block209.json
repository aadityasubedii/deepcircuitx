    "block_comment": "The dqs_even_receiver task captures incoming data from a DQS (data strobe) signals during the positive edge, specifically for even DQS lines. It uses a bit mask to target specific bits related to the given index 'i'. If toggled, 'tdqs_en' register will lead to all incoming data mask signals (dm_in_pos[i]) to be grounded, else, the current state will be transmitted as-is. The 'dq_in_pos' signal is then set by capturing and isolating data from 'dqs_even[i]' signals and retaining or clearing untargeted data from dq_in depending on the bit_mask."
