Comment: 
This block of code manages the phase of the address signal in a DRP (Dynamic Reconfigurable Port) interface. It runs at the positive edge of the DRP_CLK clock signal. If the sync_reset signal is high, the code resets the AddressPhase signal. Otherwise, it changes the state of the AddressPhase signal. If it is '1', the code will turn it '0' when the state reaches ALMOST_READY2. If it is '0', the code will set it to '1' when the state is at ADDR_PHASE and bit count equals '111'.
