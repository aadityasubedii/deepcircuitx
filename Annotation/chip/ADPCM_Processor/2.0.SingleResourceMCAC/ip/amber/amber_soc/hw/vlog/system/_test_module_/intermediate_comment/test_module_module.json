    "module": "Module-level comment: Test_module, a system test bench, interacts with a Wishbone interface for read-write operations amongst memory locations. Given input signals, decisions are made on read/write operations, data flow, status updates, and control signaling. With an array of internal signals like timers, registers, and control bits, it triggers interrupts, random number generations, and manages status registers, simulation controls, and physical grounding. The code segments handle various operations from initialization, signal assignment, to logic execution, making it an efficient system diagnostic tool."
