    "module": "Module-level comment: The ddr3_afifo module serves as an interface for asynchronous operations across different clock zones in a DDR3 system. It handles DDR3 commands, write, and read actions using an internal FIFO structure with modules 'u_afifo_cmd', 'u_afifo_wr', 'u_afifo_rd' respectively. These blocks interact with the input/output ports and internal signals ensuring correctness of operation and data integrity. Module operation is regulated by system and DDR clocks, and FIFO status is tracked to prevent invalid data access."
