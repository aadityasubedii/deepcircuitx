    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is responsible for handling interrupt events in a UART peripheral with configurable FIFO settings. It operates synchronously, updating on the positive edge of the 'i_clk' signal. When 'wb_start_write' is asserted and the input address 'i_wb_adr' matches that of the AMBER_UART_ICR, it does nothing. However, in cases where a functioning FIFO is enabled or disabled, it manages 'tx_interrupt' interrupt flag in relation to the 'tx_fifo' status and specific 'uart_cr_reg' register content. If FIFO is enabled and the transmit FIFO is half or less full with the sixth bit of 'uart_cr_reg' set, an interrupt is generated. Conversely, the interrupt is cleared if these conditions are not met. Analogous conditions apply when FIFO is disabled, but 'tx_fifo_empty' signal substitutes 'tx_fifo_half_or_less_full' in the logic. The status of the interrupt is then displayed on the console."
