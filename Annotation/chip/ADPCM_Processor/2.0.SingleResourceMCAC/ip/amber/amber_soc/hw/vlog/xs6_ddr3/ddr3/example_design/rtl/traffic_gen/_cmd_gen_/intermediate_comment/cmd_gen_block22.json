    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is an edge-triggered counter. Specifically, upon the positive edge of the input clock signal (clk_i), the value of the `addr_counts` is incremented by a pre-defined constant `INC_COUNTS` and stored in the register `addr_counts_next_r`. The operation delays by the time `TCQ`. This represents a fundamental element in sequential digital circuit designs, often used for creating frequency dividers, or event counters in hardware design."
