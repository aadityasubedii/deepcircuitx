    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, implementing command decoding, address handling, data read/write operations, and timing checks. It models DDR3 features such as burst operations, mode registers, ODT, and DLL functionality. The module uses input/output ports for control signals, addresses, and data, and employs internal signals to track timing parameters, configuration settings, and memory states. It performs extensive timing checks to ensure compliance with DDR3 specifications and uses tasks for command processing, data handling, and error checking."
