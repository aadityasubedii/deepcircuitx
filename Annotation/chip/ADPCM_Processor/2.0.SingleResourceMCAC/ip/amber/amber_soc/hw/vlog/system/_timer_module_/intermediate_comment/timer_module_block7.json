    "block_comment": "The block of code is used for generating acknowledgment signals for write or read operations in a Wishbone interface. The acknowledgment signal 'o_wb_ack' is activated upon the assertion of the strobe signal 'i_wb_stb' and when either a write operation 'wb_start_write' is initiated or a delayed read operation 'wb_start_read_d1' is under process. Given these conditions, the logic utilizes bitwise AND operations to yield the value for 'o_wb_ack.'"
