Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), handling input termination calibration for RZQ and ZIO pins, DQS delay calibration, and dynamic calibration of input termination and DQS delay. It uses a state machine to control the calibration process, adjusting termination values and DQS delays based on measurements and comparisons. The module has input ports for clock (UI_CLK), reset (RST), PLL lock (PLL_LOCK), self-refresh control (SELFREFRESH_REQ, SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE), and various MCB signals. Output ports include calibration status (DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL), self-refresh control (SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ, SELFREFRESH_MODE), IODRP control signals,
