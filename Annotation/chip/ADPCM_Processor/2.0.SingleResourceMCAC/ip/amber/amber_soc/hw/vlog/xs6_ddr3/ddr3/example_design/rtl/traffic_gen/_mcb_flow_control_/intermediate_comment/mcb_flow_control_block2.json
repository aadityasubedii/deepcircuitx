    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the state of the Finite State Machine (FSM). The implementation adopts a synchronous reset and a clock-edge-based state transition. When the lowest bit of the reset signal ('rst_i[0]') is active, the current state of the FSM is synchronously reset to '0001' at the rising edge of 'clk_i'. If reset is not asserted, the state advances to 'next_state' on every rising edge of the clock signal."
