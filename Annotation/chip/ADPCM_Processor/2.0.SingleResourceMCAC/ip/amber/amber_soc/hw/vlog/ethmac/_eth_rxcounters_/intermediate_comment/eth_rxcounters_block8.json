    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code acts as a Byte counter with a reset capability. On the positive edge of the MRxClk signal or the occurrence of a Reset signal, the code checks whether a reset is required, and if so, it resets ByteCnt to 0. If not, it checks whether the ResetByteCounter signal is active; if it is, ByteCnt is again reset to 0. However, if the IncrementByteCounter signal is active, and no reset operations were needed, ByteCnt is incremented by 1. All assignments use a propagation delay defined by `#Tp`."
