The module takes various inputs and provides corresponding outputs. It has a set of inputs to control registers and memory as well as other signals required for operation like system ready, interrupt and Fast Interrupt ReQuest(FIRQ) signals. It performs multiple functionalities including fetching data, decoding it, executing instructions, and interfacing with a co-processor.
