    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for incrementing a count on every positive edge of the input clock signal (clk_i). It implements this function by assigning the value of DWIDTH divided by 8 to the register INC_COUNTS whenever a positive edge in clk_i is detected. The simplicity of this design allows for efficient and reliable operation within a clocked digital system environment."
