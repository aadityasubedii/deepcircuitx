    "block_comment": "The provided block of code represents a task in Verilog named 'swap_args'. The function of this task is to print a set of values to a file, 'decompile_file' with a specific format. The implementation includes warming up a set of registers 'reg_d', 'reg_m', and 'reg_n' using the 'warmreg' method, and then writing these warmed up register values to 'decompile_file'. The values are written in a particular format, starting with 'reg_d' and 'reg_m' separated by a comma, and 'reg_n' enclosed in square brackets, with all values separated by spaces."
