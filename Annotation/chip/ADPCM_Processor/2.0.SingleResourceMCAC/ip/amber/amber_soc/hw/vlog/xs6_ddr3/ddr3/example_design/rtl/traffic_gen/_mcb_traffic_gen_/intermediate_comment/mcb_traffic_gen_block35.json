    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code monitors conditions where commands try to access memory beyond the defined end address. If the condition footage becomes true, it outputs an error message and sets the 'error_access_range' flag before stopping the operation. The condition is triggered when the memory command enable signal 'mcb_cmd_en_o' is high and the sum of the base address 'mcb_cmd_addr_o' and the command's byte length times the memory data width (DWIDTH/8) exceeds the defined end address 'end_addr_i'. It essentially serves as a protection mechanism against illegal memory accesses."
