    "block_comment": "The block is essentially a single line of Verilog code that generates an inverted system clock signal. It uses the bitwise NOT operator (~) to invert the original system clock ('c3_sys_clk') and assigns the result to 'c3_sys_clk_n'. This line of code plays an essential role in digital systems where inverted clock signals are often required."
