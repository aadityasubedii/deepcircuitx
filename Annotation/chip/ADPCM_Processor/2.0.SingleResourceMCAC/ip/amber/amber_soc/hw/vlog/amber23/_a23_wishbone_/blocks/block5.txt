Comment: 
This Verilog code block implements a Wishbone protocol-driven state machine for controlling memory access cycles. The states of the state machine (WB_IDLE, WB_BURST1, WB_BURST2, WB_BURST3, and WB_WAIT_ACK) represent different stages of the memory operation. It starts from IDLE, initiates memory access cycle upon 'start_access' signal, carries out memory data burst transfer in BURST states, waits for acknowledgment in WB_WAIT_ACK state, and falls back to IDLE state upon acknowledgment. Different actions are taken based on the state and the input signals such as 'cache_read_request', 'core_read_request', and 'core_write_request'. The lower bits '[1:0]' of the 'o_wb_adr' address are determined by the selected byte enable signal. The logic within each state is synchronous, driven by the rising edge of 'i_clk'.
