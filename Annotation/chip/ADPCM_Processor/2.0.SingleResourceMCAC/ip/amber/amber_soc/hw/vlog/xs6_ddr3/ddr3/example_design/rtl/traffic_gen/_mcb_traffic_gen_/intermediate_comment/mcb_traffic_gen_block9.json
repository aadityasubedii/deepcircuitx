    "block_comment": "This block of code performs the function of a read enable command in a memory controller. The command is enabled when the memory controller buffer is not full (`~mcb_cmd_full_i`) and when a high-level enabling signal is issued (`mcb_cmd_en_o`). This is implemented using the bitwise AND operator and bitwise NOT operator to determine the state of `cmd_rd_en`. This command will become enabled when `mcb_cmd_full_i` returns a 0 (indicating the buffer is not full) and `mcb_cmd_en_o` is high (turning the command on), as per the AND logic."
