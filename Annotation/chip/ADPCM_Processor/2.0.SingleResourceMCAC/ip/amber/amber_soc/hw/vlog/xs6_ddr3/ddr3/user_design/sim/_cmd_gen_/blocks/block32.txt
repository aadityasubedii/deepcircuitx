Comment: 
This block of code checks if an address is larger than or equal to a specified end address, triggered at the positive edge of the input clock. The comparison is done by extracting the first 24 most significant bits (31:8) of given addresses. If the condition is met, the 'gen_addr_larger' register is set to 1'b1, indicating that the current address is outside the defined range; otherwise, it's set to 1'b0, indicating the current address is within the acceptable range.
