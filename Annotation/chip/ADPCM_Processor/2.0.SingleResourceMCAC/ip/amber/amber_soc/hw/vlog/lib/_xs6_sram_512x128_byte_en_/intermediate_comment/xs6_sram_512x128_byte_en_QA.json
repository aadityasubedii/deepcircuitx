It provides a 128-bit wide data interface with 9-bit addressing, allowing access to 512 memory locations. The module supports byte-level write operations through a 16-bit byte enable signal. It also includes parameters for initializing the memory contents of each RAMB16BWER primitive. The module is designed for synchronous read and write operations, with data being read or written on the rising edge of the input clock."
