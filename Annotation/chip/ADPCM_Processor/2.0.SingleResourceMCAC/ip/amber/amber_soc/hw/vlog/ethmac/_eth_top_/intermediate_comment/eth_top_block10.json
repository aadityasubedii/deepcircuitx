    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a synchronous reset mechanism for a boolean flag `WillSendControlFrame_sync1`. A physically synchronous, logically asynchronous reset methodology is used for stability and synchronicity. If a reset (`wb_rst_i`) is detected on a positive clock edge (`wb_clk_i`), the `WillSendControlFrame_sync1` flag is immediately set to 0. If no reset is detected, the flag is set to the value of `WillSendControlFrame` after a delay specific by the #Tp parameter. This is achieved using the `always` block which is sensitive to either positive clock edge or a reset signal. The flag is kept synchronous to the clock signal to prevent glitches and setup time violations."
