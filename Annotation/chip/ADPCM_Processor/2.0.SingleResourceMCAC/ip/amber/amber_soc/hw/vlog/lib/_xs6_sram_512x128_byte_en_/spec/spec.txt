Module name: xs6_sram_512x128_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 512x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using four RAMB16BWER primitives from Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. It provides synchronous read and write operations with a 128-bit wide data interface and 9-bit addressing. The module has five input ports: i_clk (clock signal), i_write_data (128-bit input data), i_write_enable (write enable signal), i_address (9-bit address input), and i_byte_enable (16-bit byte enable signal). The output port o_read_data provides 128-bit read data. Internal signals include nc24_00, nc24_01, nc24_02, nc24_03 (unused 24-bit signals) and wea
