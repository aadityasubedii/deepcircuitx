    "block_comment": "This line in Verilog RTL code represents an assignment operation on a wire named 'dq_error_bytelane_cmp'. The wire 'dq_error_bytelane_cmp' is assigned the value stored in the register 'dq_lane_error_r1'. The purpose of this line is to copy or forward the status of 'dq_lane_error_r1' into 'dq_error_bytelane_cmp'. The operation will occur as soon as any change is detected in 'dq_lane_error_r1', providing an effective way to track and mirror the changes."
