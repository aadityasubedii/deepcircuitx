    "block_comment": "This Verilog generate loop constructs a series of OSERDES2 serializers to convert parallel data into serial data. The loop iterates over each address line (derived from C_MEM_ADDR_WIDTH) to instantiate an OSERDES2 block. Changes in the input parallel data (address_90) on each cycle of 'ioclk0' clock signal are serially output through the OSERDES2 blocks at 'ioi_addr'. The parameters for each OSERDES2 block are configured according to various constants, like C_OSERDES2_DATA_RATE_OT, C_OSERDES2_OUTPUT_MODE_SE, and others. The reset signal (int_sys_rst) is hooked up to ensure the circuit can be reset."
