    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the 'rd_mdata_afull_set' signal within a synchronous design. At the rising edge of the clock (clk_i), if the reset signal 'rst_rb' is asserted, the 'rd_mdata_afull_set' is set to 0 with a delay of 'TCQ'. If the 'rst_rb' is not asserted and the 'rd_mdata_fifo_afull' is true, the 'rd_mdata_afull_set' is set to 1 with a delay of 'TCQ'. This code is presumably used to manage a Full signal of a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data buffer within a read operation, with 'rd_mdata_afull_set' flag serving as an indication of the buffer being almost full.\n"
