    "block_comment": "This block is implementing an output buffer with tri-state control, abbreviated as `OBUFT`. The main function of this block is to connect an internal signal to an external pin, allowing for output from the FPGA. This is accomplished through instantiation of an `OBUFT` using the identifier `iob_cke`. `.O(mcbx_dram_cke)` specifies the output connection for the buffer which is the FPGA external pin associated with the `mcbx_dram_cke` signal. `.I(ioi_cke)` is the internal FPGA input for the `OBUFT`, specifying the data source signal. Lastly, `.T(t_cke)` defines the tri-state control signal for the `OBUFT`. When the control signal `t_cke` is high, data is output on `mcbx_dram_cke` and when low, the output goes to high impedance state, effectively disconnecting the output."
