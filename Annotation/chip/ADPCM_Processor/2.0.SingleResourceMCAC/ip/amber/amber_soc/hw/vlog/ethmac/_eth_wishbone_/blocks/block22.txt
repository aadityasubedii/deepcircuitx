Comment: 
This block of code primarily manages the synchronous reset and update operations for the `RxAbortSync4` register. If a positive edge trigger is detected on the `Reset` or the `WB_CLK_I` (Write Back Clock Input), it initiates the process within the block. It checks if `Reset` is high; if so, it synchronously resets the `RxAbortSync4` register to zero after a delay of `Tp` units. Otherwise, it updates the `RxAbortSync4` register with the current value of the `RxAbortSync3` register, also after a delay of `Tp` units.
