    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the readiness state of a command in a synchronous system. It primarily operates on a rising edge clock signal. When the reset signal is activated, or if the command start signal is active and the block length equals to 1, it sets the command ready signal to 1 with a delay. However, if the command start signal is active and block length is not equal to 1, it sets the command ready signal to 0. If those conditions aren't met, the block checks for a user burst count of 2 and the FIFO not being full, and in such a case, again, the command ready signal gets set to 1. All these operations ensure that the command only gets the readiness state when necessary conditions are met."
