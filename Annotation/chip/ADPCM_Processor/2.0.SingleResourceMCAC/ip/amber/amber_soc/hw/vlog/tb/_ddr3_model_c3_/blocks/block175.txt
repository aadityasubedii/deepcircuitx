Comment: 
This block of code is designed to detect timing violations related to a reset pulse in a Verilog digital design. The block responds to a positive edge of the reset signal (`rst_n_in`). When a positive edge is detected, and the simulation time is greater than 100,000, the block checks if the simulation time from the last event is still within a predefined period (100,000 time units). If not, it reports an error indicating a reset pulse width violation, alongside the excess time. This is implemented using built-in system functions; `$time` for keeping track of the simulation time, and `$display` to report anomalies.
