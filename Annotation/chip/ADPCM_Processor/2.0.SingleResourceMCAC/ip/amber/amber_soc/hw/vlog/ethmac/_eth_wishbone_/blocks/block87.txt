This block of code handles the transmission completion for a packet in a system with a write-back (WB) clock signal. Upon a rising edge of the WB clock or a system reset, the block checks several conditions to determine how to set the 'TxDonePacketBlocked' signal. If the system is in reset, it immediately sets 'TxDonePacketBlocked' to false. On the other hand, if the transmission is not complete (as indicated by '!TxDone_wb') but was completed in the previous state ('TxDone_wb_q'), it also sets the 'TxDonePacketBlocked' signal to false. If a transmission of a packet is complete ('TxDonePacket'), then 'TxDonePacketBlocked' is set to true. This is achieved using sequential logic inside an 'always' block for synchronous operations.
