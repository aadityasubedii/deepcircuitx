Comment: 
This code block functions as a setup for a timing check, specifically setup to be triggered on the negative edge of the fifth element of the DQS_IN array. The DQS_IN array is presumably a clock-signal array in the DRAM system and the action launched on the negative edge of this signal would likely correspond to a read or write operation on the DRAM. The timing check's specific purpose would be to verify that such operations are suitably synchronized with the DRAM's internal clock.
