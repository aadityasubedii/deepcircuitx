This block manages the count of 'Delayed Cyclic Redundancy Check' (DlyCrcCnt) by monitoring incoming frame validity and end status throughout a reception cycle. The count is synchronously reset under two conditions: a high-level reset trigger (RxReset) or at the end of a valid frame reception, as indicated by RxValid & RxEndFrm. If a valid frame is still being received (RxValid is high and RxEndFrm is low) and the current DlyCrcCnt is less than its highest limit (DlyCrcCnt[2] is low), the count will increment by one at each rising edge of the MRxClk clock pulse.
