The block of code assigns values to the variables r_MAC, r_HASH1, and r_HASH0. The specific function of the block is to map or assign MAC-address and hash outputs to the respective variables. The 48-bit MAC-address is split into two parts: the lower 32 bits are assigned to r_MAC[31:0] and the upper 16 bits are assigned to r_MAC[47:32]. Simultaneously, r_HASH1 and r_HASH0 are assigned the 32-bit outputs of HASH1 and HASH0 respectively. The assignments are achieved using the "assign" keyword, which is a continuous assignment statement in Verilog that drives the right-hand side operand to the left-hand side variable.
