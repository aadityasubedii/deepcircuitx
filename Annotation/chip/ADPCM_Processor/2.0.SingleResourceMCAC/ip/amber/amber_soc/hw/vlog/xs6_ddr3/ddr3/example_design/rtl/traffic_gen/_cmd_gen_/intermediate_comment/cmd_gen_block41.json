    "block_comment": "The code block functions as a register-based counter for read data. On a positive clock edge, if the reset input is asserted, the register counters for read data and total read data are reset to zero. If instead read data is being received (indicated by reading_rd_data_i) the counters increment by one on each positive clock edge."
