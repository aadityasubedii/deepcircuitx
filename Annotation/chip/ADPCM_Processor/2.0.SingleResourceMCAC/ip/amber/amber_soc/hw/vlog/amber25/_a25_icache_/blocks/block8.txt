This block of code is designed to implement a 3-way check function based on the WAYS logic variable. It checks if the logic variable "WAYS" equals "3" and invokes the block labeled "check_hit_3ways". It executes the statements inside the block "check_hit_3ways" when "WAYS" equals "3". This block signals an essential part of a cache hit lookup operation for a 3-way set associative cache.
