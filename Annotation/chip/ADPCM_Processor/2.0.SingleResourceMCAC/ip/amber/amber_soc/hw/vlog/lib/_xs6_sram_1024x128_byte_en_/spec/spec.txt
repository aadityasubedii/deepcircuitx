Module name: xs6_sram_1024x128_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 1024x128-bit SRAM with byte-level write enable functionality, using 8 RAMB16BWER primitives to create a total memory capacity of 1024 words, each 128 bits wide. The module supports separate read and write operations, with the ability to selectively write to individual bytes within a 128-bit word. It has input ports for clock (i_clk), write data (i_write_data), write enable (i_write_enable), address (i_address), and byte enable (i_byte_enable), and an output port for read data (o_read_data). The memory is divided into two banks, each consisting of 4 RAM blocks, controlled by the most significant bit of the address. Internal signals include write enable signals for each bank
