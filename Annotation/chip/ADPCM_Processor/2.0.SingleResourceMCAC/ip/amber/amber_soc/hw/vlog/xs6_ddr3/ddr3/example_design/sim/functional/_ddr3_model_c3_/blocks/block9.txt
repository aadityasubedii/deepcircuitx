Comment: 
The block of code is a timing check related to a rising edge of the input 'dqs_in[23]'. Using the "always@" construct in Verilog, the block continually monitors the 24th bit of the 'dqs_in' input array for a transition from low to high (positive edge). When this event occurs, it triggers the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function for the 24th bit, which is likely designed to ensure proper timing or sequencing of operations related to this input.
