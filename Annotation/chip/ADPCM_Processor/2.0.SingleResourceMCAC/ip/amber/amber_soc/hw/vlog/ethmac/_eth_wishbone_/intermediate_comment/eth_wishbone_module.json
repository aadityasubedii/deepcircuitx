    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module implements a Wishbone interface for an Ethernet controller, managing communication between the Ethernet MAC and Wishbone bus. It handles transmit/receive operations using buffer descriptors, FIFOs, and state machines. The module synchronizes between Wishbone and Ethernet clock domains, manages DMA-like transfers, and generates interrupts for various Ethernet events. It includes logic for frame assembly/disassembly, error handling, and status reporting.\n*/"
