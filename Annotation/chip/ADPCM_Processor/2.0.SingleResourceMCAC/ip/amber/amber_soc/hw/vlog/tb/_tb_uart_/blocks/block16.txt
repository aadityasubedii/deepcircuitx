Line number: 
[131, 131]
Comment: 
The line of code essentially checks if a received bit count equals zero. This is used to identify the start of the bit reception in a serial communication protocol. The 'assign' keyword is used to bind the boolean result of the equivalence check operation to the signal 'rx_bit_start'. This statement simply sets 'rx_bit_start' to high (1) when 'rx_bit_count' equals 0, signaling that the bit reception has begun, and to low (0) otherwise.
