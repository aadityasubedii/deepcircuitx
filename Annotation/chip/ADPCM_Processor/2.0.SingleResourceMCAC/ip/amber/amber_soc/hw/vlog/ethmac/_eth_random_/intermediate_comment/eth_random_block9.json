    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the 5th element of the array, Random. This assignment depends on the RetryCnt variable. If RetryCnt values more than 4, the 5th element of the array Random will be assigned the value of the 5th element of array x. Otherwise, it assigns a 0 to the 5th position of the Random array. This is a conditional assignment performed using the conditional operator ?: in Verilog."
