This block of code is designed to trigger at the rising edge of the i_clk signal. If the "wb_stop" signal is not high or the "o_mem_stall" signal is high, three operations are performed concurrently: "mem_read_data_r" is assigned the value of "mem_read_data_c", "mem_load_rd_r" is assigned the value of "mem_load_rd_c", and "mem_read_data_valid_r" is assigned the value of "mem_read_data_valid_c".
