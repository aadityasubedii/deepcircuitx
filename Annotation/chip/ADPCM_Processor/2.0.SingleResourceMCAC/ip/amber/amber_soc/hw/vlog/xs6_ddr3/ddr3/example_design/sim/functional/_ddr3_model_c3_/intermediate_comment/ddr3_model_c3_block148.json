    "block_comment": "The block of code in Verilog is a timing check task for data strobe and data input. It verifies the timing rules for data hold (tDH) and input pulse width (tDIPW). This is done by computing the difference between the current simulator time and the time when the strobe or data were last valid. If the difference is less than the specified timing parameters (TDH and TDIPW), an error message is displayed. The error message specifies the current time, the violated strobe or data bit, and the amount of time by which the violation occurred. The block also clears the check_dm_tdipw flag and updates the last valid time for the data bit."
