    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a counter configuration logic. It determines the incremental counts ('INC_COUNTS') based on the data width ('DWIDTH'). If the 'DWIDTH' falls in the range of 256 to 576, 'INC_COUNTS' is set to 32. If 'DWIDTH' is between 128 and 224, 'INC_COUNTS' is set to 16. In the case of 'DWIDTH' being either 64 or 96, 'INC_COUNTS' is set to 8. Lastly, if 'DWIDTH' equals 32, 'INC_COUNTS' is set to 4. The values are set upon the rising edge of the input clock signal 'clk_i'.\n"
