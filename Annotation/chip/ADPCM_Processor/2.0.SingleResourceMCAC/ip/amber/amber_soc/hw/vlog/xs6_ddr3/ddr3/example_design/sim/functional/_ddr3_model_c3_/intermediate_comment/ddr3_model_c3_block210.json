    "block_comment": "The block handles memory operations for a DDR memory model. The reset task runs when reset is asserted negatively. It checks if the clock signals are low or high, any other state is an error. It examines if the module is in self-refresh mode, or in power-down with no active banks, as well as addressing clock frequency changes. It calculates jitter at each clock edge, checks for tIS (input setup time) violation, ensures proper operation of the mode register, checks and controls auto-precharge operations on each bank, and oversees Read and Write operations. The block also quantifies timing violations, updates delay-locked-loop timings, and manages On-Die Termination (ODT) processes. Finally, with each clock cycle, command and data pipelines are shifted. The section of code is riddled with error checks to ensure the DDR memory is operating correctly, towards achieving the correct CAS Write Latency, avoiding timing violations, and proper initialization and operation of DLL."
