Comment: 
This block of code checks for invalid command conditions on the second writable port (port 2). The code conducts this function through an always block, which reacts to any change in the inputs specified in the if condition. This if condition triggers an error message and ends the simulation when a 'Command for write only' to port 2 is unknowingly attempted, shown by specific binary flag settings in 'C_PORT_CONFIG' and 'p2_cmd_instr', as well as 'p2_cmd_en' being enabled.
