This block of code defines two bit-wise AND operations on a variable named NibCnt. NibCntEq7 represents the bit-wise AND of the three least significant bits of NibCnt. NibCntEq15 represents the bit-wise AND of all four bits of NibCnt. This implies each assignment operation is checking if all the selected bits of NibCnt are high(1). For instance, NibCntEq7 returns true (1) only if the three least significant bits of NibCnt are all high (each bit is 1), and NibCntEq15 returns true only if all four bits of NibCnt are high(1).
