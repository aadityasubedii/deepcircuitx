This block of code is responsible for detecting and flagging FIFO errors based on the comparison of transfer address and MCB command address. Specifically, during the positive edge of the input clock signal, if the MCB command enable output is active, it checks if the transfer address is not equal to the MCB command address output. If they are not equal, the FIFO error is set (`fifo_error <= #TCQ 1'b1`) with the delay specified by TCQ. Otherwise, the FIFO error is cleared (`fifo_error <= #TCQ 1'b0`) with the same delay.
