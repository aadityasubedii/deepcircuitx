    "block_comment": "The block of code functions as a multiplexer (MUX), effectively performing selection between multiple inputs based on the value of a control line. Through assigning the value of the output as the value of one of the 'n' inputs, the MUX implements the select functionality. The 'generate' and 'endgenerate' keywords here form a loop equivalent for parameterized blocks, creating the multiple instances of the internal structure, from 0 to (n-1). The implementation employs a case statement to facilitate the selection process, meaning each of the variables (s_in) receive a value from one of the outputs (sel_in) based on the selector condition (`sel`)."
