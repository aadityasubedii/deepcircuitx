This block of code defines an always block that is triggered on the rising edge of the signal "dqs_even[15]". The implementation detail of this block involves calling the function "dqs_even_receiver" with the argument "15" whenever a positive edge is detected on signal "dqs_even[15]". This mechanism ensures the processing of incoming data at every high transition of the mentioned signal.
