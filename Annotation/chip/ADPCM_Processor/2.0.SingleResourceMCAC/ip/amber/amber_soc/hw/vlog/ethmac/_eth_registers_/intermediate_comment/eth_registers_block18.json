    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a flip-flop with a reset functionality for the purpose of synchronizing the signal `SetTxCIrq_sync1` with the transmit clock `TxClk`. This synchronizer helps to avoid issues related to metastability. On every rising edge of the `TxClk` or the `Reset`, the logic is triggered. If a reset is performed (i.e., `Reset` is HIGH), the `ResetTxCIrq_sync2` is forced into a known state (`0`). However, if no reset is performed, `ResetTxCIrq_sync2` takes the value of `SetTxCIrq_sync1` with an introduced delay of `#Tp`."
