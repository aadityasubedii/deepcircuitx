Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for assigning the output of the shift register to the Serial Data Input (SDI) of the Digital Register Peripherals (DRP). This is achieved through accessing the first index (logic level) of the shift_through_reg array and assigning it to the DRP_SDI input. The operation essentially uses shift register as a means of serial to parallel conversion to facilitate DRP functionality.
