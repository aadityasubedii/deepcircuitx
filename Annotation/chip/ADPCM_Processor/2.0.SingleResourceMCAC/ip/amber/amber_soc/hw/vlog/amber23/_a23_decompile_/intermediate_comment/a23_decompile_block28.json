    "block_comment": "This block in Verilog assigns a string value to `TYPE_NAME` based on the value of `itype`. It's a conditional assignment utilized to map different `itype` values to corresponding operation types in a processor\u2019s instruction set, like \"REGOP\", \"MULT\", \"SWAP\", \"TRANS\", etc. If none of the given conditions matches, \"UNKNOWN \" will be the default assignment."
