    "block_comment": "The code is a shifter block used for right barrel shifting of bits by specific amounts based on certain input conditions in a digital circuit. The shifter is conditionally defined based on the parameter FULL_BARREL. If FULL_BARREL is enabled, it can shift from 0 to 31 bits, otherwise, it supports quick shifting of up to 3 bits. The shift amount depends on input `i_shift_amount` and also on `i_shift_imm_zero`. Special conditions involve using a `i_carry_in`. Note that the shifting block is being set via an `assign` statement, with the output denoted by `ror_out."
