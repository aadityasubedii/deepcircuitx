    "block_comment": "This block represents a declaration and instantiation of a dual-port Block RAM (RAMB16BWER) in Xilinx FPGA, named `u_sram5`. The RAM has a data width of 36 bits for both ports. The block mainly performs the function of reading and writing data. Write operations are performed when specific write enable bits `WEA` are set, with the data to be written specified by the `DIA`. The data is written to the address represented by `ADDRA`. For read operations, the data is read from the Block RAM and outputted on `DOA` whenever `ENA` is enabled, with `i_address[8:0]` determining the address to read data from. Rest of the signals are either tied to logical 0s, indicating they're not used, or they're connected to fixed values or configurations. These include settings for initialization, reset and collision check conditions, etc. No asynchronous reset or output registers are used as indicated by `DOA_REG` and `DOB_REG`."
