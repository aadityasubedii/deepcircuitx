This block of code is basically used as a synchronous reset mechanism for a User Interface (UI) hardware module. The code gets executed at the rising edge of the UI clock or when the Reset (RST) signal is high. If the Reset (RST) signal is high, it resets specific hardware registers (ZIO_IN_R1, ZIO_IN_R2, RZQ_IN_R1, and RZQ_IN_R2) to default values, which is zero in this context. The two types of registers here look like they might control different types of input or output interfaces in the hardware module.
