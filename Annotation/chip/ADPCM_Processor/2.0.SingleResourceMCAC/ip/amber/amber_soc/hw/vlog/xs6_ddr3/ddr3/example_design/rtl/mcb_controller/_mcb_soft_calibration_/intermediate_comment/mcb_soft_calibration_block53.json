    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the state transition in a state machine. It waits for a signal `IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N` to proceed. If the signal is not ready, it stays in the `WAIT2` state. If the signal is ready and either `RZQ_IN` is true or `P_Term` equals to `6'b111111`, it transitions to the `MULTIPLY_DIVIDE` state. Otherwise, it transitions to the `INC_PTERM` state."
