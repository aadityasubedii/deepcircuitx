    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to create a Boolean assignment for the `TxLengthEq0` signal in a synchronous digital system. This signal will be high (true) when the value of `TxLength` is zero. It does this using the `assign` keyword in Verilog, which creates a continuous assignment statement - in other words, it will always evaluate and assign the state of `TxLengthEq0` based on the current value of `TxLength`."
