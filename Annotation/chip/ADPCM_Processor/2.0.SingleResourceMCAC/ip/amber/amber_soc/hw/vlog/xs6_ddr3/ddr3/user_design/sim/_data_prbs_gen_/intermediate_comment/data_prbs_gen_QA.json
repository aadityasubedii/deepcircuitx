It accepts inputs like clock, reset, clock enable, PRBS seed from initial or forced, and a flag for a fixed seed value initialization. The module generates a pseudo-random bit sequence of a specified width (PRBS_WIDTH). The core of the generator uses a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) for producing the pseudo-random sequence and includes options to control the shift amount via inputs, thereby adjusting the pseudorandom sequence. The generated sequence can be retrieved through an output port."
