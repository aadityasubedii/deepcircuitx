    "block_comment": "This block of code is performing an assignment operation in Verilog. Specifically, it is assigning the value of `addr_o[ADDR_WIDTH-1:0]` to `mcb_cmd_addr_o`. The `addr_o[ADDR_WIDTH-1:0]` implies a slice operation where the specific portion of the addr_o signal, represented by the indices specified from 0 to ADDR_WIDTH-1, is extracted and then assigned to mcb_cmd_addr_o. Thus, this code is used for signal/variable assignments and indexing in digital design modules."
