Comment: 
This block of Verilog code enables a timing check for a command address. Specfically, it sets up an event-driven procedural block that activates whenever there's a change in the most significant bit (16th bit) of the input address (addr_in[15]). Upon activation, it calls the function cmd_addr_timing_check with the constant argument 22. This function presumably performs a timing check on the address, although the nature of the check isn't clear from this context.
