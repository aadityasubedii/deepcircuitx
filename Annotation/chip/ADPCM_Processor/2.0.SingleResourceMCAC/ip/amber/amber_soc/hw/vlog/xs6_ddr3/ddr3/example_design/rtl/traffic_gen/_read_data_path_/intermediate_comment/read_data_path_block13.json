    "block_comment": "This block performs pipelining for read data (rd_v6_mdata) across multiple stages using flip-flops. At every positive edge of the input clock (clk_i), the read data is shifted through a pipeline of four consecutive registers (rd_v6_mdata_r1 to rd_v6_mdata_r4) to ensure data synchronization and stability across design branches with different latencies. This design strategy helps maintain system clock speed by segmenting long combinational paths into smaller ones."
