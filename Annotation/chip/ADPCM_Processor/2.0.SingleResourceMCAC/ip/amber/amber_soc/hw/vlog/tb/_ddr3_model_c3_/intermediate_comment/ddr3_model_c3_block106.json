    "block_comment": "This block of code launches a `dq_timing_check` function whenever there's a change in the 24th index of `dq_in` array. The `always @` construct is used in this block to monitor the 24th position of the `dq_in` array, and whenever it discerns a change, it instantiates the `dq_timing_check(24)` function."
