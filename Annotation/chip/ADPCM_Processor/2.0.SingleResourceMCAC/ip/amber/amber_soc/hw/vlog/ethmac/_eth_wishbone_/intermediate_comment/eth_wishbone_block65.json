    "block_comment": "This block manages the state of the signal TxAbort_wb based on the rising edge of WB_CLK_I or Reset. If a reset is detected, the TxAbort_wb signal is immediately set to 0 with a delay defined by Tp. Conversely, in the absence of a reset and the presence of a rising edge clock signal, TxAbort_wb is assigned the current value of TxAbortSync1 with the same Tp delay. Hence, this block serves as a sequencer for Abort command with incorporation of synchronous reset functionality."
