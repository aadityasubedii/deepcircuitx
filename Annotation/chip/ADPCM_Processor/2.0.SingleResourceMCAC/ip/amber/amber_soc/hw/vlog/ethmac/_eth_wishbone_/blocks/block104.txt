The block serves as an address setup for a Transmit Buffer Descriptor (TxBD) in a communication system, specifically under reset conditions or during the transmission enable signal changes. On rising edge of the system clock or during a system reset, the block either resets the TxBD Address to zero or assigns a new address depending on the transmitted enable signal and write status. If the module is reset or the transmit enable signal is activated for the first time (indicated by previous transmit enable signal being low), the TxBD address is reset. Alternatively, if status is ready for write, the address becomes the 'TempTxBDAddress'.
