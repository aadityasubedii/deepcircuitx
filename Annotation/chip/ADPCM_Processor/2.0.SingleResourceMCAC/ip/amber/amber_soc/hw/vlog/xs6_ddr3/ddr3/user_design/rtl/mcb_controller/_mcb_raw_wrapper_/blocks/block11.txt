Comment: 
This block of code represents an output buffer (`OBUFT`) instantiation in Verilog which drives memory row-access-strobe (RAS) signal to an external DRAM module (mcbx_dram_ras_n). It passes the signal (ioi_ras) from the FPGA's internal logic to its output pin, under the control of a tri-state control signal (t_ras). The output 'mcbx_dram_ras_n' is enabled when 't_ras' is low, otherwise it goes into high impedance state to avoid any conflict with other potential drivers on the same line.
