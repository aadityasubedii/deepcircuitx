    "block_comment": "This block serves as an initialization task in a larger Verilog design. It sends a series of commands via the cmd_task function, providing different settings for memory mode registers. If the debug flag is on, the task outputs a status message. The task initializes by sending No Operation (NOP) and ZQ commands. Then it loads mode register values from 0 to 3 using the LOAD_MODE command. The commands send to cmd_task are Event (1 or 0), CMD (NOP, ZQ, LOAD_MODE), Address(3, 2, 1, 0), and mode register values(mode_reg3, mode_reg2, mode_reg1, mode_reg0)."
