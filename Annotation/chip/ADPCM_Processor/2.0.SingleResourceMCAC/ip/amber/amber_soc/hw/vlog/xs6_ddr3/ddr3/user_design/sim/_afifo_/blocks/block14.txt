Comment: 
This line of code assigns the write pointer to the write address in a hardware design scenario. Its function is to direct the location where data will be stored or written to in a memory structure. In the context of implementation, it uses the simple hardware assignment operator (`assign`), typically used in continuous assignment statement in Verilog, to bind `wr_addr` to `wr_ptr` implying that any changes in `wr_ptr` will immediately reflect in `wr_addr`.
