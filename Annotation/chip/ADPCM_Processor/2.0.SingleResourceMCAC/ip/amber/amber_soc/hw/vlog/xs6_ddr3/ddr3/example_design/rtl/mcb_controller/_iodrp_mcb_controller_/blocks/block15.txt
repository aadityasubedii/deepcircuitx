Comment: 
This block of code is primarily responsible for associating each state of a finite state machine (FSM) with a corresponding ASCII string, effectively acting as an enum-to-string conversion module. The implementation leverages a sequential always block in Verilog which triggers on any change in the 'state' variable. The case statement within the always block maps each possible 'state' value to an equivalent ASCII string representations for easy debugging or display purpose.
