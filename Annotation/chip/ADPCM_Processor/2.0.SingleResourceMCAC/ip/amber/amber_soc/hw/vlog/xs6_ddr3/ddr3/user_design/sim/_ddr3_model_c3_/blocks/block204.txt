This block is used to trigger the 'dqs_even_receiver' function whenever there's a positive edge in the 'dqs_even' signal at the 4th index. The function is implemented using the 'always' keyword at the positive edge of the signal 'dqs_even[4]' which indicates a change from low to high value. When this event occurs, the function 'dqs_even_receiver' with argument 4 is called in response.
