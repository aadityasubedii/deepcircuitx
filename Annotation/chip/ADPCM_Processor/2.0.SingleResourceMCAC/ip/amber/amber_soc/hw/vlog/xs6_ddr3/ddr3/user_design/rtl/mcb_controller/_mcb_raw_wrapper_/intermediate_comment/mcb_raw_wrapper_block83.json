    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for controlling the soft calibration self-refresh request of a system (soft_cal_selfrefresh_req) based on different condition check. The block gets triggered at every positive edge of ui_clk and sets the 'soft_cal_selfrefresh_req' signal according to the multiple system conditions; if system reset is active, the request is turned off. It is turned on when the system is in the state of self-refresh, and when system is not in self-refresh state and pll_lock is active, the request is again turned off.\n"
