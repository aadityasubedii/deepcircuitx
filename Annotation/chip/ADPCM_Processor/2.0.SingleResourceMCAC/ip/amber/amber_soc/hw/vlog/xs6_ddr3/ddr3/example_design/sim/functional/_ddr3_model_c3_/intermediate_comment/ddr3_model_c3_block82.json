    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for indicating a specific process known as a timing check with respect to the 49th bit in the 'dq_in' signal. The syntax 'always @' is employed to specify the process is sensitive to changes in the value of 'dq_in' at the 49th (index 48) location which therefore triggers the 'dq_timing_check' function for the 49th bit, when there's a change. The 'dq_timing_check' function is most likely defined elsewhere that implements the timing check for 'dq_in' signals."
