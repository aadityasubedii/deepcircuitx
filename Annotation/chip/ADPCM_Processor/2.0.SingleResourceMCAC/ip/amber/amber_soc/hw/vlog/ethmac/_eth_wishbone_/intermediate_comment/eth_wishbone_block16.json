    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block handles latching of receiver status information based on specific clock and reset signals. Upon the rising edge of the MRxClk or Reset signals, the logic examines the state of Reset. If Reset is high, it forces the RxStatusInLatched value to 0 with a delay specified by the parameter Tp. Conversely, if Reset is not high but LoadRxStatus is high, it latches the RxStatusIn value into the RxStatusInLatched with a delay of Tp. This block serves as a necessary mechanism for synchronizing and updating the receiver's status in communication systems."
