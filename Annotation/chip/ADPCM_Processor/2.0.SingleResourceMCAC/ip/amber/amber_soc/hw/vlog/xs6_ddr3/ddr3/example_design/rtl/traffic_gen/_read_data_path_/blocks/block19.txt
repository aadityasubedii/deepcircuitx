Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for validating the comparison data. It uses a rising-edge triggered clock event (`posedge clk_i`), after which it sets the `v6_data_cmp_valid` value based on the delay modelled by `#TCQ` to the `rd_mdata_en`. This means the validation status is updated synchronously with the clock signal in a delay defined by `TCQ`, which provides better control over the verification process.
