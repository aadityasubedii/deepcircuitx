Comment: 
The block of code handles the synchronization of the start of receiving frames in a certain system, working based on a positive clock edge (`WB_CLK_I`) and a reset signal (`Reset`). Upon receiving a high reset signal, the block sets `SyncRxStartFrm_q2` to 0, which could be indicating a cessation of frame reception. Otherwise, the module passes the present state of `SyncRxStartFrm_q` into `SyncRxStartFrm_q2`. This introduces a delay based on `Tp`, to sync the signal with the next system's components, which might be operating on different clock speeds or need a delayed response.
