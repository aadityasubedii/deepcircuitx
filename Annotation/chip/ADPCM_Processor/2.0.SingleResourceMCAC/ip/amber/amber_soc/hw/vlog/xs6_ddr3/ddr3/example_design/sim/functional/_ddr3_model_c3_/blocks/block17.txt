Comment: 
This block of code initiates the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' at the falling edge of the 16th bit of the 'dqs_in' signal. The use of 'always @' ensures that the function call is sensitive to changes in 'dqs_in[15]', particularly a transition from high to low on the clock edge. As a result, 'dqs_neg_timing_check' is set to monitor the timing and the possible discrepancies on the falling edge of the 'dqs_in[15]' signal.
