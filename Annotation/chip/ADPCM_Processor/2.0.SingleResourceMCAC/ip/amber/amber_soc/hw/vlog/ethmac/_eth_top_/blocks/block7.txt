Comment: 
This block of code defines an edge-triggered flip-flop synchronous with the clock 'wb_clk_i' and asynchronous reset 'wb_rst_i'. When a positive edge of 'wb_rst_i' signal or 'wb_clk_i' occurs, the code inside the block is executed. Upon reset (when 'wb_rst_i' is high), the signal 'RstTxPauseRq' is cleared to 0. In the absence of the reset signal (during normal operation), 'RstTxPauseRq' is updated with the logical AND of 'WillSendControlFrame_sync2' and the logical NOT of 'WillSendControlFrame_sync3', but the update happens after a delay equivalent to propagation delay 'Tp'.
