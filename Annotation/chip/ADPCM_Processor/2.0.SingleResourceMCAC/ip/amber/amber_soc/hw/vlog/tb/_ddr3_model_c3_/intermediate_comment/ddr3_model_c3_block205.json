    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a data receiver tied to a specific edge of a signal called 'dqs_even[3]'. It operates by triggering the 'dqs_even_receiver' function whenever there's a rising (pos) edge on the 'dqs_even[3]' bit signal, thus ensuring subsequent operations are performed in sync with the positive transition of 'dqs_even[3]'."
