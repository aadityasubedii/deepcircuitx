    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the IO Buffers (IOBUFs) for the data strobe signals based on the memory configuration options. It generates specific I/O buffers depending on the memory type and the number of data pins. When the memory type is DDR, MDDR, or DDR2 with differential DQS disabled, and the number of data pins is 16, it generates undirectional IOBUFs. If the number of data pins is 16 and the memory types are other than specified above, it creates bi-directional IOBUFs (IOBUFDS) for each of those memory types."
