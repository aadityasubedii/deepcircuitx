This block of code is responsible for launching a procedure called 'cmd_addr_timing_check' with a parameter of '17' whenever the 11th bit (index 10) of the 'addr_in' bus changes. The procedural block 'always @' is used to respond to dynamic changes in 'addr_in[10]', implementing an event-trigger based on the status of this particular bit.
