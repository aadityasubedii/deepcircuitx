    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting customizable cache lines, words per line, and associativity. It manages read/write operations, cache misses/hits, and implements a write-back policy with cache flushing and exclusive access handling. The module uses a state machine to control cache operations, separate tag and data memories for each way, and a random replacement policy. It interfaces with the processor core and external memory, handling data transfers to improve memory access performance."
