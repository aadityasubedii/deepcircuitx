Module name: ddr3. Module specification: The ddr3 module is a DDR3 memory controller interface that configures and instantiates a memory controller core, likely from Xilinx, to interface with DDR3 SDRAM. It includes parameters for configuring various aspects of the memory interface such as clock periods, memory part specifications, port configurations, and timing parameters. The module has input ports for system clock (c3_sys_clk), reset (c3_sys_rst_i), and multiple command, write, and read interfaces (c3_p0_* to c3_p5_*) for up to six memory access ports. Output ports include control and address signals for the DDR3 SDRAM, clock outputs, calibration status, and status signals for the command, write, and read interfaces. Internal signals are used for clock management, reset control, debugging, and supporting multiple memory access
