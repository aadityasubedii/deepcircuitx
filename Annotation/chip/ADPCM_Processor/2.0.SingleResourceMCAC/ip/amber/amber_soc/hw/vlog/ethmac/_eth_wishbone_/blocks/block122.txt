This Verilog block implements a state machine for controlling data transmission and reception via the Wishbone bus protocol. On reset, all relevant signals are reset to known values. In non-reset states, the block uses casex branching to define behavior for various combinations of internal signal states. The block handles transmit-enable flags, incrementing transmit pointer, incrementing burst counters, updating bus address, determining if burst counters reach burst length, and assigning command tags (CTI). The block toggles between transmit and receive modes (MasterWbTX and MasterWbRX) depending on the current state. Workspace allows for various states, such as waiting for new data and transferring data from or to the memory. The default case ensures stability by retaining current values if no matching state is found.
