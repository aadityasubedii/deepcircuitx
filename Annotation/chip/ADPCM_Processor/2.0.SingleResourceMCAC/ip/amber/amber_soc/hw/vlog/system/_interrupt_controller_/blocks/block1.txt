Comment: 
This block performs a write/read operation into the Interrupt Controller Register of the Amber Processor based on the start write or read acknowledge signal. It initializes at the positive edge of the input clock, then it checks if the write start signal or the write back read acknowledge are enabled. If the write start signal is triggered, it writes the input data into the register otherwise it reads from the output data register. The operation description is printed to the console. The address for write/read operation is decided upon the 16 least significant bits of the address and the corresponding operation description is printed to the console. For the unrecognized addresses, an error message is printed to indicate such scenario. It also displays the register’s name and its associated operation based on register’s address.
