    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'afifo' module is an asynchronous FIFO memory management design facilitating separate write and read operations via different clock signals. The module employs \"wr_pointer\" and \"rd_pointer\" for indexing next write or read positions, stored in a data array representing the FIFO memory. Write/read operations and status updates are synchronized across clock domains using Gray code conversion. This design is essential for efficient data flow management within hardware systems."
