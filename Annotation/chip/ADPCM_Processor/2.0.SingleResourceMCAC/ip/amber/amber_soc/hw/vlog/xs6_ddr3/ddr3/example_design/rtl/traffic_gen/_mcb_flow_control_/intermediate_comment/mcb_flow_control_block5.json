    "block_comment": "This block of code operates a synchronous command write pending (cmd_wr_pending_r1) signal in a digital logic circuit. It uses a clock (clk_i) edge-sensitive always block, indicating its dependencies on clock cycle changes. When a reset signal (rst_i[0]) is active, the command write pending signal is de-asserted. The block also checks for the last word written (last_word_wr_i); If true, the command write pending signal is asserted. Furthermore, if the push command (push_cmd) is issued, the command write pending signal is de-asserted. There's propagation delay (#TCQ) to simulate the real hardware behavior. This maintains the accuracy of the signal state according to the clock cycles and specific conditions."
