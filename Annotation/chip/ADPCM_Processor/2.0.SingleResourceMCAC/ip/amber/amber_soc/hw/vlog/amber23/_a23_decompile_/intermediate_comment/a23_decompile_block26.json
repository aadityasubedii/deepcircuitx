    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for synchronously updating the current instruction execution status. The update occurs at the positive edge of the input clock, meaning this code implements a rising-edge sensitive flip flop. The status flag xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE_R is updated with the value of xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE when a rising edge of i_clk signal is detected. This mechanism allows synchronization of system's operations in accordance to the clocking sequence."
