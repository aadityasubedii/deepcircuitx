Module name: infrastructure.

Module specification: The infrastructure module is a hardware design in Verilog intended for managing different clocks in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device. Its functionalities are achieved by utilizing customizable parameters and it involves creating various clocks, distributing them, and managing various frequencies and phase shifts. Additionally, the module also generates a reset signal and various internal signals for control and synchronization purposes.

The module has the following inputs: differential clock positive input (sys_clk_p), differential clock negative input (sys_clk_n), system clock input (sys_clk), and a system reset input (sys_rst_i). The output ports include two system clock outputs at different phase settings (clk0, sysclk_2x and sysclk_2x_180), system reset output (rst0), asynchronous reset (async_rst), Memory controller block dynamic reconfiguration port clock (mcb_drp_clk), two phase-locked loop clock enable signals (pll_ce_0 and pll_ce_90), and a phase-locked loop lock signal (pll_lock).

This module also uses several internal signals such as: clk_2x_0 and clk_2x_180 (used for creating clock signals of double the system clock frequency), clk0_bufg (output of the global clock buffer), locked and powerup_pll_locked (signals indicating the state of the phase locked loop), and sys_rst (Internal representation of system reset signal).

The code structure consists of several blocks. The initial part includes parameters and I/O port declaration. The differential clocking scheme is implemented through an IBUFGDS block within the generate-if structure. It employs a PLL_ADV block for its numerous functionalities such as generating clocks of varied frequencies, phase shifts, duty cycles, and more. Further, the code utilizes various forms of buffers (BUFG, BUFGCE, etc.) for proper clock signal propagation. Asynchronous and synchronous reset logic are handled by always blocks and BUFPLL_MCB block is employed for generating clock output and indicating LOCK status for phase synchronization.
