    "block_comment": "This block monitors the system for potential errors and halts if there has been too much activity without completion. The block is triggered by the positive edge of the 'wb_clk_i' signal. When the counter 'cnt' reaches 1000, it indicates that something may be going awry, and the code proceeds with debug information printing. It examines whether the wishbone cycle 's1_wb_cyc_o' or 's2_wb_cyc_o' is active. Depending on the active signal, it subsequently prints out related bus information as hexadecimal values, which could be helpful in diagnosing problems. After displaying the error and debug info, system execution is stopped with `$stop`."
