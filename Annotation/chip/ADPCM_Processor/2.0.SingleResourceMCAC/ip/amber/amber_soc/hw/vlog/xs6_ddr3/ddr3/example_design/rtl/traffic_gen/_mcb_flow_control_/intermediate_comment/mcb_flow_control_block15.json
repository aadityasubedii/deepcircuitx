    "block_comment": "This line of code is primarily serving as an assignment operation in Verilog. It connects a bus line input (bl_i) to an output (rd_bl_o). It refers the value on the input bus line to the output to read it. This functionality is achieved simply by using the \"assign\" keyword which in Verilog means continuous assignment and creates a constant connection between the left and right hand sides."
