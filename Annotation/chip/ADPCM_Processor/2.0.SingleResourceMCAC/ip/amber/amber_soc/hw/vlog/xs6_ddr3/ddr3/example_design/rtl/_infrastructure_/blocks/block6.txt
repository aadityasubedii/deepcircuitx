Comment: 
This code block controls the status of the `powerup_pll_locked` signal in response to system reset (`sys_rst`) and buffer PLL lock (`bufpll_mcb_locked`) conditions. The block listens for a positive edge in the `mcb_drp_clk` clock signal or the `sys_rst` reset signal. If the system is in reset (`sys_rst`), the `powerup_pll_locked` signal is set low (1'b0). However, if the buffer PLL reports a locked state (`bufpll_mcb_locked`), the `powerup_pll_locked` signal goes high (1'b1). This synchronous block provides a mechanism for ensuring appropriate signal statuses directly after a system reset and when buffer PLL achieves lock condition.
