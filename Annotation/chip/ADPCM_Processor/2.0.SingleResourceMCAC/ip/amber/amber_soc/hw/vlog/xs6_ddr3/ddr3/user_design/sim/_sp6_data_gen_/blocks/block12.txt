Comment: 
This block generates specific data patterns based on the data width and pattern type. When the data width (DWIDTH) is 128 and the data pattern (DATA_PATTERN) is either "DGEN_WALKING0", "DGEN_WALKING1", or "DGEN_ALL", a particular set of operations is invoked under the label "WALKING_ONE_128_PATTERN". The 'generate' statement coupled with 'if' condition is used to dynamically instantiate particular code depending on the specified conditions.
