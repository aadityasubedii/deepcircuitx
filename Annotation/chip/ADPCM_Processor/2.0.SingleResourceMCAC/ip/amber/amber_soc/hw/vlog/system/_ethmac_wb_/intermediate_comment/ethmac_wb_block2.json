    "block_comment": "The code block handles write and read data for a Wishbone bus with data width of either 32 or 128 bits. For 128-bit data width, it splits the data and selection lines into 32-bit quadrants depending upon the 2 least significant bits of the address, providing sliced up write data, selection, and a read data response with zero-padding. When the data width differs (32-bit), it simply delivers the data, selection, and the read data as is, without any modifications."
