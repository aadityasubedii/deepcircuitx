This block of code manages the TxB_IRQ signal in a Verilog-based HDL design. Driven by either a positive edge clock transition or an explicit reset, it resets the signal to zero when the reset condition is specified. Otherwise, it sets TxB_IRQ to the inverse of the TxError signal when both TxStatusWrite and TxIRQEn are true. In all other cases, it resets TxB_IRQ signal to zero.
