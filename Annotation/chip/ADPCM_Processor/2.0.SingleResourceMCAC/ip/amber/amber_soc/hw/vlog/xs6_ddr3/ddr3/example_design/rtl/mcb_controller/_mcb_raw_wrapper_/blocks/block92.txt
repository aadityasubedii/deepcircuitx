The block of code defines a function that performs ceiling division. The function takes two integer inputs: the numerator ('num') and the divisor ('div'). It calculates the quotient of 'num' divided by 'div' and increments the quotient by 1 if there is a remainder (achieved by 'num' modulo 'div' gives a nonzero result), mimicking the behavior of the mathematical ceiling function on division operations.
