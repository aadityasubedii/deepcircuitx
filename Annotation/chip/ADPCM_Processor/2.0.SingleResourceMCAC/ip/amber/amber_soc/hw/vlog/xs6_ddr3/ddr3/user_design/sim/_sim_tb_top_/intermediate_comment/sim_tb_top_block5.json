    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of 'c3_error' to the 'error' signal. This Verilog RTL code block is a simple data transfer, using the 'assign' keyword to achieve continual assignment for the 'error' signal from the 'c3_error' signal. It helps in reflecting the status of 'c3_error' in 'error' in real-time, enabling effective error tracking and management in the system."
