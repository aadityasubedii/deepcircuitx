Comment: 
The provided Verilog code block handles a UART transmission of data bytes. On the rising edge of a clock signal, if a transmission bit pulse is detected, the block sequences through state machine stagesâ€”from idle to data transfer to stop. In the idle state, checking if a transmission FIFO is not empty and the UART is ready initiates the transfer sequence by setting the transmission state to start. In the start state, a transmission line is set low and the FSM moves to the data states wherein the individual bits of a byte stored in 'tx_byte' are sequentially transmitted. After transmitting all data bits, the FSM enters the stop states which level the transmission line high before returning to the idle state. An unused default case simply sets the transmission line level high.
