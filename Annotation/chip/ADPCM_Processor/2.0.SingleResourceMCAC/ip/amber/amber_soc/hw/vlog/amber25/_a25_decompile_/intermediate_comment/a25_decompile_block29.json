    "block_comment": "The block of code is a conditional statement checking if the opcode corresponds to either a MOV or MVN operation. This is done by comparing the current value of the 'opcode' variable to pre-defined constants MOV and MVN using a logical OR operation. The result of this operation is assigned back to the 'opcode_move' variable. This design pattern is commonly used to detect certain conditions or operations in Verilog RTL codes."
