    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for the operation of a counter that resets and increments based on certain conditions. The reset happens when a positive edge is encountered on the reset or clock signals. The counter is also reset when any of the four signals (s1_wb_ack_i, s1_wb_err_i, s2_wb_ack_i, or s2_wb_err_i) are active. When either s1_wb_cyc_o or s2_wb_cyc_o are active, the counter increments. The increment and reset actions are not immediate; they happen after a delay specified by 'Tp'."
