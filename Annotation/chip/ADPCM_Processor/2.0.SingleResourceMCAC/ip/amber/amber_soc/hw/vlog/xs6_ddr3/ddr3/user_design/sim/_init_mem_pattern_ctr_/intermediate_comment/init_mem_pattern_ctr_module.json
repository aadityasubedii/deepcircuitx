    "module": "Module-level comment: The module init_mem_pattern_ctr is a memory traffic pattern generator and tester. It generates specific read and write commands to the memory with different modes of memory traffic. Inputs include control signals and configuration parameters, and outputs include various system states and operation parameters. The module uses a state machine for operations flow control with internal signals and registers to manage state and parameter tracing. The module also handles different family devices and adjusts parameters and operations accordingly. Its functionality is implemented through input-output ports, internal signals, module parameters, and procedural blocks."
