This block of code is intended to load data from a specific file into the main memory system. Once the file specified by `MAIN_MEM_FILE` is successfully opened, each line is read one by one and checked for alignment and formatting. If it's correctly formatted (doesn't start with '//' or erroneous hexadecimal values), the address and data values are extracted from the line, and the data is added into the main memory system. The memory system being loaded depends on whether the code is executed in a XILINX_FPGA environment or not, with different handling and memory mappings for each scenario. Elapsed ticks from the clock counter is displayed to keep track of loading progress. Error messages are thrown if the file fails to open, or if the file contains formatted errors. At the end, the total number of lines read from the file is displayed.
