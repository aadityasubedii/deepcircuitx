    "block_comment": "The purpose of this block is to assign the value of the wire `prbs` to the output `prbs_o`. This is achieved using the `assign` keyword, which assigns the value of the wire on the right (`prbs`) to the wire on the left (`prbs_o`). Therefore, any change in the value of `prbs` will be reflected in `prbs_o`.\n"
