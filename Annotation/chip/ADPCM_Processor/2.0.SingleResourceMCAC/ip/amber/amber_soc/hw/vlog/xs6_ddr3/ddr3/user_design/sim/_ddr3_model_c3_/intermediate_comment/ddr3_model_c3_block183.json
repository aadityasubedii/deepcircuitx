    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for instantiating a receiver for \"dqs_odd\" signals whenever there's a rising edge detected on the 9th bit of the \"dqs_odd\". It utilizes an edge-triggered always block to execute the procedure \"dqs_odd_receiver\" targeting the 9th bit on every positive edge of the \"dqs_odd\" signals, effectively creating a mechanism for capturing data during specific timing intervals."
