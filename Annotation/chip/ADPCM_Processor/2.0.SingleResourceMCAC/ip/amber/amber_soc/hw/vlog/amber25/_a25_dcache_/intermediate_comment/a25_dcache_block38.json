    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for controlling request pulses and exclusive access in a cache system. The `request_pulse` is assigned a high-level only when both `i_request` and `i_cache_enable` are high, indicating a valid request is made and the cache is active. Similarly, `exclusive_access` is granted when the conditions `i_exclusive` and `i_cache_enable` are true, meaning an exclusive access request is made when the cache is on. These assignments ensure both request handling and access exclusivity are controllable as per the system requirements."
