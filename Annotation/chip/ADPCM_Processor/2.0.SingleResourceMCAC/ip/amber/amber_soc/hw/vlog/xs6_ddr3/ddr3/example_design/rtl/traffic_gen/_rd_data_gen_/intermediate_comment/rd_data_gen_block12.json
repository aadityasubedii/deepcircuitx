    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to create a register named `user_bl_cnt_is_1` and assign it to an output wire (signal) `user_bl_cnt_is_1_o`. The purpose of this block is to assign the current state of the register `user_bl_cnt_is_1` to an external signal `user_bl_cnt_is_1_o` which can be used for later processing or providing output to other modules or hardware. The implementation is very straightforward - a register is declared, and its value directly assigned to the output."
