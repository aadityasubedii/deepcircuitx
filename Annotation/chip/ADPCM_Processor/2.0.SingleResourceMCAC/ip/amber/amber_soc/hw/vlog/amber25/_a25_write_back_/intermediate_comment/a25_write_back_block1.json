    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is operating as a sequential logic that updates a data address register. The block is controlled by the rising edge of the system clock ('i_clk'). If the memory is not being stalled (signified by 'i_mem_stall' being low), the data address register ('daddress_r') gets updated with the value of the input data address ('i_daddress') on the rising edge of the clock. This mechanism ensures that the data address register ('daddress_r') does not get updated while the memory is stalled, hence preserving the synchronization in the system."
