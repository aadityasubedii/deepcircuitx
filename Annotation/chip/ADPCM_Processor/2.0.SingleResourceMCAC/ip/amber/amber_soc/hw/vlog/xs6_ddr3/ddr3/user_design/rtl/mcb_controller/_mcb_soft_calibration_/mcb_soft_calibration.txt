Module-level comment: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), including input termination and DQS delay calibration. It uses a state machine to control the calibration process, interfacing with IODRP controllers to adjust termination values and DQS delays. The module performs initial calibration, dynamic calibration, and handles self-refresh modes. It iteratively measures and compares values to optimize signal integrity and timing for improved memory interface performance.
