    "block_comment": "This block of code checks the timing of the command address. The implemented function, `cmd_addr_timing_check`, is always sensitive to the changes in the fifth bit (index starts from 0) of the `addr_in` signal. Whenever this bit in `addr_in` changes, the function `cmd_addr_timing_check` with parameter 11 is invoked, performing the specified timing checks in the process."
