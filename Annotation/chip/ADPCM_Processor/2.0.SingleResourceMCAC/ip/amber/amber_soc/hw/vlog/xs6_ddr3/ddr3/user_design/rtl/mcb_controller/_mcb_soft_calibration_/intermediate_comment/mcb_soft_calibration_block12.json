    "block_comment": "This block manages the commencement of a dynamic calibration process after a self-refresh function in a memory control system. The process executes at every positive edge of the user interface clock (UI_CLK). When reset (RST) is active, it initializes PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH and START_DYN_CAL_STATE_R1 signals to a low status (1'b0). If not reset, it updates the PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH with the state of START_DYN_CAL_STATE_R1. It sets START_DYN_CAL_STATE_R1 high when the system is in the START_DYN_CAL state and sets it to low otherwise. The starts the dynamic calibration process upon exit of self-refresh under certain conditions or sets PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH to low when the system enters the START_DYN_CAL state, assuring that self-refresh is not in multi-controller buffer mode."
