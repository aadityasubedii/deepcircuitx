Module name: xilinx_dist_ram_16x32. 

Module specification: The xilinx_dist_ram_16x32 is a hardware design module written in Verilog RTL that implements a distributive memory for Xilinx FPGAs, pooling multiple RAM16X1D elements to form a larger 16-depth, 32-bit wide RAM. It provides inputs to both control its write operations (we, wclk, and data_in) and specify addresses for the write and read operations (write_address and read_address). The 'we' input or write enable indicates when the data can be written into the RAM. The 'wclk' input or write clock is used for synchronizing the write operations. The 'data_in' is the 32-bit data input bus that carries the data to be written into the RAM. Meanwhile, the read/write addresses are 4-bit wide inputs determining the locations in the memory to be read from or written into. The module also features a 32-bit 'data_out' output line, outputting the data read from the memory. Two internal wires, 'waddr' and 'raddr', internally pass the write and read addresses to the RAM blocks respectively. The functionality is further realized through instantiations of 32 individual RAM16X1D elements that form the 32-bit wide data interface. Each of these blocks operates synchronously with the write clock, controlled by the write enable and dynamically taking in data from 'data_in' while outputting to 'data_out' based on the corresponding addresses.
