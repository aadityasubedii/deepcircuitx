    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for controlling the lock state of a phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit based on specific conditions. Upon detecting a rising edge of the 'ui_clk' clock signal, it checks whether both 'selfrefresh_enter' and 'selfrefresh_mode' signals are not active (represented by the ~ operator). If the condition is met, it assigns the current state of 'pll_lock' to 'syn_uiclk_pll_lock', effectively creating a conditional synchronization mechanism between the two."
