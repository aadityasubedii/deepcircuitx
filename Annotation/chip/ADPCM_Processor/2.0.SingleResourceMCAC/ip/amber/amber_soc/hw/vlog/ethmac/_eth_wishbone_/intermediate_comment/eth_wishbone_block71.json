    "block_comment": "This line of code is essentially creating a wire for the writeback stage of a FIFO read operation. It performs a bitwise AND operation between `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync2` and the complement of `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync3`. This resultant assignment to `ReadTxDataFromFifo_wb` ensures that the data can only be read from the FIFO when the conditions of `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync2` being HIGH (1) and `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync3` being LOW (0) are both met."
