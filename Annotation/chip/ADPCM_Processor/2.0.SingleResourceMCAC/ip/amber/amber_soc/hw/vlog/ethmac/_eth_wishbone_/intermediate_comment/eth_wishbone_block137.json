    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is used for generating a reset defer signal latched based on the status of the processing block. Specifically, it carries out a bitwise AND operation between 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync2' and the bitwise negation of 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync3', and assigns the output to 'RstDeferLatched'. The action effectively means 'RstDeferLatched' will be high only when 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync2' is high and 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync3' is low, mimicking the functionality of a deferred reset in digital circuit design."
