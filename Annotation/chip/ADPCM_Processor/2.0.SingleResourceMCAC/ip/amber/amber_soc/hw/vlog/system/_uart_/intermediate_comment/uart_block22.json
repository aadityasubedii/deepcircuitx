    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a shift register functionality. It's triggered on every rising edge of the system clock (`i_clk`). The shift register is 3-bit wide, shifting the contents of `uart0_cts_n_d` to the left and inserting the new serial data, `i_uart_cts_n`, at the least significant bit (LSB) location. The shifted data is stored back in `uart0_cts_n_d` for the next clock tick."
