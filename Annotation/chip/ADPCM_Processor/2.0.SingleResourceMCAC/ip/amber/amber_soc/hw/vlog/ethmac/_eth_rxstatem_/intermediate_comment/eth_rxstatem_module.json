    "module": "Module-level comment: The eth_rxstatem module operates as a state machine for Ethernet frame reception, transitioning through various states (idle, preamble, SFD, data, drop) based on input conditions. The transitions are regulated by StartX and StateX signals. It handles frame reception at byte-level granularity, tracking byte counts and received data to facilitate precise control and error management. Clock edges and a reset signal drive state updates and synchronization."
