The block of code manages the condition of a soft calibration self-refresh request signal. It works on the positive edge of the user interface clock. A system reset immediately disables the request. If a third stage self-refresh entry condition is detected, the request is enabled. If the system is not in this state and the phase-locked loop (PLL) is locked, the request is again disabled. Lastly, if none of these conditions are met, the request maintains its current state.
