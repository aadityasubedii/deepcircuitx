    "block_comment": "This Verilog block primarily serves as a timing validator, verifying specific timing constraints in the program flow. The task checks for two critical timing violations: the Input High Time (tIH) and the Input Pulse Width (tIPW) for the command or address signals. These constraints are confirmed by comparing the time elapsed since the positive clock edge (`tm_ck_pos`) and the timestamp of the command event (`tm_cmd_addr[i]`) against the respective thresholds (TIH and TIPW). If a violation is found, an error message is displayed with relevant details. The task also updates `tm_cmd_addr[i]` with current timestamp every time it is executed."
