    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs barrel shifting on an input signal i_in, with shift amount specified by i_shift_amount. If FULL_BARREL is set to 1, it enables shifting by any amount between 0 and 32, with condition checks for every possible shift amount. If 'i_shift_imm_zero' is set or shift amount is zero, input 'i_in' is carried forward and no shift operation is performed. At each condition, inputs are shifted left by desired amount with 0's appended at the end. If FULL_BARREL is not set to 1, a quick shift is available for a shift amount between 0 to 3. The two modes (full barrel and quick shift) offer flexibility based on the performance requirements of the RTL design."
