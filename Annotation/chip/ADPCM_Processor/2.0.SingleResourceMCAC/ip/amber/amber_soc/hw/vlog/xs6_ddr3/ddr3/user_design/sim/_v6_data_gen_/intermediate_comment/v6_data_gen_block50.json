    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is utilized to manage different data patterns for a module with 32 data pins. If the number of data pins equals 32 and the specified data pattern matches one of the predefined patterns (\"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", \"DGEN_ALL\"), this block of code initiates the corresponding pattern detection process. The operation depends on the rising edge of the input clock signal (posedge clk_i), which triggers the execution of the implementation under the defined conditions."
