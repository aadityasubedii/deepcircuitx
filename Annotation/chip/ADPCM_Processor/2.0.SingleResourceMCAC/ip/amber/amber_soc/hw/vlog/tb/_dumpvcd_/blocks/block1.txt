This block of code is responsible for controlling digital signal dump process based on specific system clock counts. The block is triggered at the positive edge of 'i_clk'. It checks if the count of clocks hits 10, or 20, or matches 'AMBER_DUMP_START', or equals 'AMBER_DUMP_START' plus 'AMBER_DUMP_LENGTH', and reacts by turning digital signal dump on or off, coupled with displaying the current clock count. If 'AMBER_TERMINATE' is defined, the script will terminate the test after the dump has completed and send out an error message.
