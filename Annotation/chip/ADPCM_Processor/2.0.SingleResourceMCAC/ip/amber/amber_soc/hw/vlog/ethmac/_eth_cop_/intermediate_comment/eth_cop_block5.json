    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the output error signal `m2_wb_err_o` in a system. It generates errors based on the status of signals related to master 2's transactions with slave 1 and slave 2. If transaction with master 2 is in progress and it is addressed to slave 1, it mirrors slave 1's error signal to master 2's output error. If it is addressed to slave 2, it mirrors slave 2's error instead. If there is no transaction in progress and master 2 is making a new transaction request without addressing either of the slaves, it outputs an error. Otherwise, it clears the error output."
