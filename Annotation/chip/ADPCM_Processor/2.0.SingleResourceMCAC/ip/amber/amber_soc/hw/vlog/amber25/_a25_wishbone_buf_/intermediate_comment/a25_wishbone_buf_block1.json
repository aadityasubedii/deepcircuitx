    "block_comment": "This Verilog block manages a data valid flag based on the validity of inputted and outputted data and the acceptance flag. When a positive edge clock signal comes, it checks if the output data is valid, if the write operation is not happening and if the input data is accepted; under these conditions, it sets the \"wait_rdata_valid_r\" flag to true. Conversely, if the input data becomes valid, it resets \"wait_rdata_valid_r\" to false."
