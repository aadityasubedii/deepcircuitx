Comment: 
This block is tasked with managing a read pointer (`rd_ptr`) that modifies its position upon receiving a read strobe (`rd_strobe`). The behavior adheres to a rising edge clock (`rd_clk`) and has a reset control (`rst`). Whenever the reset signal is active, the read pointer and its corresponding Gray code representation (`rd_gray`) are set back to zero. If the reset is not active and a read strobe is detected, the read pointer is incremented. Additionally, a temporary holder (`rd_ptr_tmp`) obtains the value of the current read pointer, and the next Gray code representation is assigned to `rd_gray`.
