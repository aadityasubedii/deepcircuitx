    "block_comment": "The block of code handles read and write requests in a memory controller. It synchronizes with a clock signal, which triggers the data processing operations. It waits for a positive edge on the clock signal and checks the read acknowledgment signal to set or reset the read ready signal. If the command buffer isn't full, it latches the write request, read request, and word-wide bus address signals into registers. It also manages an active read flag, which is set when there's a read request and reset when a read acknowledgment is received. It's used to generate a read acknowledgment when the read data isn't empty and a read operation is active."
