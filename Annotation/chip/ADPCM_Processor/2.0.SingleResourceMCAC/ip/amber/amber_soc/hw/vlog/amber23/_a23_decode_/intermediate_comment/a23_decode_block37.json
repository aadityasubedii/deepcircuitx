    "block_comment": "The block of code operates as a data selector for a 32-bit immediate operand of an instruction, based on the type of instruction (`itype`). If the instruction is a multiply operation (`MULT`), the immediate operand is zero. For Memory Transfer (`MTRANS`), it uses `mtrans_base_reg_change` as the immediate operand. For branch (`BRANCH`) and simple transfer (`TRANS`) instructions, `offset24` and `offset12` are used respectively. Further accommodation is provided for different `instruction[11:8]` values, with each appending the lower 8 bits (`imm8[7:0]`) of the operand to varying lengths of zero-bit padding based on the instruction type."
