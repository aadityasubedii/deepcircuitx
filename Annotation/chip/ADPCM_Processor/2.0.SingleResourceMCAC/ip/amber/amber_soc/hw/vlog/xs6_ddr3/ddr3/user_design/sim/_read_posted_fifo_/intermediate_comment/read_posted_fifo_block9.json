    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for updating the signal 'data_valid_r'. It does this at the rising edge of the input clock signal 'clk_i'. The delay constant 'TCQ' is applied to this process, ensuring the 'data_valid_r' signal is aligned with the 'data_valid_i' input but with a latency of 'TCQ'."
