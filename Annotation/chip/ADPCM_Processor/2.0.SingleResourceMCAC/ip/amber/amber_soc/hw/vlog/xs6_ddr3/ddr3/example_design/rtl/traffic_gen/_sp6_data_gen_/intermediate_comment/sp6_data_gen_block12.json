    "block_comment": "This block provides functionality for memory data shifting and formatting based on different operating conditions. Primarily controlled by the clock input, a reset command sets the data to zero during high reset signal. During readiness of the FIFO buffer and at the commencement of a command, the data is manipulated according to command start, the data mode and the number of DQ pins. Memory data, `w1data` is bit-sliced and reassigned to achieve a shift of data, governed by the `#TCQ` delay element. Different conditions establish different formats for `w1data` with boundaries determined by `DWIDTH` variable and the current `addr_i` value. In case of 16 DQ pins, memory data is conditionally mapped with SHIFTB outputs, or alteratively integates with zero sequences for specific data_mode. For 8 DQ pins, shifting logic is simplified into a linear combination of SHIFT inputs. For all other DQ pin counts, w1data is assigned a fixed hex value given by the data mode.\n"
