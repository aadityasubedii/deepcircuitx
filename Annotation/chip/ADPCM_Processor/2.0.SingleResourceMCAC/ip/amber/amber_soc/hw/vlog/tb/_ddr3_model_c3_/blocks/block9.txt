Comment: 
This block of code cycles through the Digital Quadrature Signal at each positive edge of the 24th element of the dqs_in array. It achieves this by making use of a timing check function, ‘dqs_neg_timing_check’, for each positive edge transition of the 24th index (23 in zero-based index) of the Digital Quadrature Signals array 'dqs_in'. It invokes the ‘dqs_neg_timing_check’ function with '23' as an argument whenever a positive edge transition is detected.
