It incorporates design features available in synchronous design, like full, empty, almost full indicators. The module also contains provisions for writing to and reading from the FIFO, and controls for write and read enablement, reset, write and read clocks. The write data is passed as a parameterized width input signal and read data is passed as an output signal. The input write and read signals 'wr_en' and 'rd_en' control when data is written to and read from the FIFO. The signals 'full', 'empty' and 'almost_full' indicate the status of the FIFO. Please note that it works asynchronously, controlled by separate write and read clocks, which means data can be written and read at different frequencies. The module uses Gray code to address and keep track of read and write positions to prevent issues in asynchronous operation."
