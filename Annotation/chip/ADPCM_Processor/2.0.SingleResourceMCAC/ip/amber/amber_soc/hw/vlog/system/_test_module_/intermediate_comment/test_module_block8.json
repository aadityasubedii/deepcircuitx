    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for managing the behavior of a random number generator upon certain conditions. It uses the input clock signal (i_clk) to synchronize its operations. The random number (random_num) is updated either by writing data from the Wishbone bus (wb_wdata32[7:0]) when a write operation is initiated (wb_start_write is true) and the 8-bit address (i_wb_adr[15:8]) matches a predefined address (AMBER_TEST_RANDOM_NUM), or by generating new random numbers through XOR operations and bit inversions on certain bits of the existing random_num when a read operation is initiated (wb_start_read) and the 8-bit address matches the predefined address."
