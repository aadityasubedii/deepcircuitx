Module-level comment: 'a25_write_back' is a memory management module which latches incoming data, data validity, load register index, and data address during a clock cycle where memory stall signal is deasserted. It utilizes input ports like i_clk, i_reset, i_mem_stall etc., and outputs the latched values through o_wb_read_data, o_wb_read_data_valid, and o_wb_load_rd. The internal registers, updated based on the memory stall signal, retain data read from memory, validity of the read data, load index, and data address, facilitating memory management.
