    "block_comment": "This code block governs error management in a system with possibly two addressable blocks (S1 and S2). It continuously monitors a set of conditions (signaled by various input variables), and based on them, it sets the error output (m1_wb_err_o). If a process (m1_in_progress) is underway, it routes the corresponding error inputs from either S1 (s1_wb_err_i) or S2 (s2_wb_err_i) to the error output, depending on which block is currently being addressed. In the event where a write cycle (m1_wb_cyc_i) and a write strobe (m1_wb_stb_i) are triggered without either block being addressed, an error state is signaled. Otherwise, the error state is cleared in all remaining circumstances."
