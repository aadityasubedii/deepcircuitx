This block is a conditional hardware generate statement for an AXI interface module, activated when `C_S4_AXI_ENABLE` is disabled. It's primarily used to directly assign values to the interface signals, which are related to reading, writing, and command operations, to their internally mapped signals. Performance indicators such as count, full, empty, underrun, and overflow for read and write operations are also assigned. By implementing it this way, it allows reusable and modular design for AXI interface components.
