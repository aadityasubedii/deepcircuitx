Module-level comment: The eth_clockgen is an Ethernet system's clock generator that manipulates the Clk signal using a configurable Divider to produce a slower Mdc clock signal. It also generates MdcEn and MdcEn_n control signals, which are reversed depending on the Mdc state. Internally, an 8-bit Counter is used for the clock division, which is controlled by Reset and CountEq0 signals. The Divider input is adjusted by TempDivider and CounterPreset to ensure a minimum clock division factor. Two central blocks control the Counter's update and Mdc's toggling based on the reset and Counter states, along with parallel assignments determining control signals.
