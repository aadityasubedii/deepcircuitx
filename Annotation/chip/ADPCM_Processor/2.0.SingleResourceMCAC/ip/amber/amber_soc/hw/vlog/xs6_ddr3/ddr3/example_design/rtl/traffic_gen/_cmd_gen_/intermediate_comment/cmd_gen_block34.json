    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for comparing a specific section of an \"addr_out\" bus with a corresponding section of an \"end_addr_i\" bus and accordingly setting the \"gen_addr_larger\" flag. On the rising edge of the system clock signal 'clk_i', it compares the higher 24 bits (from bit 8 to bit 31) of the \"addr_out\" and \"end_addr_i\". If the \"addr_out\" is greater than or equal to \"end_addr_i\", it sets the \"gen_addr_larger\" flag to 1, indicating that the output address has crossed the defined boundary. Otherwise, it sets the flag to 0."
