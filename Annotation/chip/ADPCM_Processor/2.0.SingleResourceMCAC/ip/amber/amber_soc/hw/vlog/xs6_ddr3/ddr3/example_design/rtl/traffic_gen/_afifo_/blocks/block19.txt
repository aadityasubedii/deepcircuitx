This block of Verilog code is used to implement a synchronous update of the `rd_capture_ptr` with `rd_ptr`. The implementation is straightforward; within a digital circuit, whenever the value of `rd_ptr` changes (indicated by the `always @ (rd_ptr)`), it triggers an update `rd_capture_ptr = rd_ptr;`, effectively making `rd_capture_ptr` track the value of `rd_ptr` continuously.
