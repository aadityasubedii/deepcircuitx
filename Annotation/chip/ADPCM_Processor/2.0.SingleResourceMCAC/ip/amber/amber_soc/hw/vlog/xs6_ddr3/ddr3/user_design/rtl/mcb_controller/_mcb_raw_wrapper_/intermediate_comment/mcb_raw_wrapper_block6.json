    "block_comment": "This block is used to control On-Die Termination (ODT) for DDR2 and DDR3 memories. Specifically, the generate statement creates an output buffer 'iob_odt' if the memory type is DDR3 and either RTT or Dynamic ODT is not turned off, or if the memory type is DDR2 and RTT is not turned off. This output buffer 'iob_odt' receives the 'ioi_odt' signal as input and passes it through when 't_odt' signal allows; effectively controlling ODT to negate the impedance mismatch and improve signal integrity."
