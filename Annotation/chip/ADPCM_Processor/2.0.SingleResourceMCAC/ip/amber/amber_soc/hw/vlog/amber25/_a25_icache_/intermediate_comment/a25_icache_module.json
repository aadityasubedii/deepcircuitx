    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable instruction cache for a core processor. It manages cache operations including read hits/misses, write-back requests, and cache flushing. The module uses a state machine to control cache operations, employs RAM modules for tag and data storage, and implements a way-picking function for cache line selection. It supports various FPGA targets and includes error checking and debugging features."
