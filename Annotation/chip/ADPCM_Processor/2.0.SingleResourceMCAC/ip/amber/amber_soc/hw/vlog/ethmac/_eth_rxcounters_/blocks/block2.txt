Comment: 
This block assigns the value of 'IFGCounterEq24' based on the evaluation of the condition within the parenthesis. The block is comparing whether the five least significant bits (bits 4 down to 0) of the 'IFGCounter' equal to the hexadecimal value '0x18' or the boolean value of 'r_IFG'. The boolean OR ('|') functionality ensures that if either of these conditions returns true, 'IFGCounterEq24' will be set to true.
