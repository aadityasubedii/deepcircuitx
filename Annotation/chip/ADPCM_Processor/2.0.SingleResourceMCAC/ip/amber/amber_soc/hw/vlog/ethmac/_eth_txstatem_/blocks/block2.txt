The block monitors any changes on system reset or MTxClk positive edge, to make adjustments to various state indicators. Upon system reset, all indicators (StateIPG, StateIdle, StatePreamble, StatePAD etc.) are commanded to default states, except for StateDefer which is set to 1. Outside resets, it updates the system conditions (StateData and StateJam_q) and proceeds to applying situational logical rules to further determine other states behaviours (such as StateIPG, StateIdle, etc.), driven by specific Start signals. The logical rules often set the state behaviours to 0 if more than one starting signal is high, or they complement the state if its corresponding start signal is high.
