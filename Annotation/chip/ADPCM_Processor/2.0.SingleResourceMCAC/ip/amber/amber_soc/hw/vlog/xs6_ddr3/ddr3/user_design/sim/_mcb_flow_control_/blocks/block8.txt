This block of code implements a flip-flop operation in a Verilog module. The operation is performed on the rising edge of the input clock signal (clk_i). Specifically, the block regulates the timing of setting 'push_cmd_r' to the value of 'push_cmd' signal after a delay specified by TCQ time units whenever a positive transition of clk_i is encountered.
