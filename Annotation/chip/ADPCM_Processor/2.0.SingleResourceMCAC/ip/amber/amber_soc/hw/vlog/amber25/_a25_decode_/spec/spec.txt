Module name: a25_decode. Module specification: This module is an instruction decoder for an ARM processor core. It takes in fetched instructions and various control signals, decodes the instructions, and generates control signals for other parts of the processor. Key inputs include clock, reset, fetched instruction, core stall, interrupt requests, and status bits. Outputs include decoded control signals for ALU operations, register selection, memory access, and status bit updates. The module uses numerous internal signals for instruction processing, state management, and conflict detection. It implements a state machine to handle different instruction types and execution stages, including data processing, memory operations, branches, and interrupts. The decoder manages the processor's pipeline, handles special cases like multiple register transfers and coprocessor operations, and implements the ARM instruction set architecture. Major code sections include instruction decoding logic, state machine implementation, interrupt handling, and various execution states for different instruction types. The module also includes functionality for conditional execution
