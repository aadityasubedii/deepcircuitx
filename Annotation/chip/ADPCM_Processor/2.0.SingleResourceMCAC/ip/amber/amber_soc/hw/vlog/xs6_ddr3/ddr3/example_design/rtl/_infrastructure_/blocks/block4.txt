Comment: 
This block provides an asynchronous reset facility for the system. It creates a unified reset signal (async_rst) which gets activated if either the system reset signal (sys_rst) is high or the PLL (Phase Locked Loop) power signal (powerup_pll_locked) is not locked or absent. The implementation employs a bitwise OR operation to combine input signals, and a bitwise NOT operation to invert the signal from the PLL.
