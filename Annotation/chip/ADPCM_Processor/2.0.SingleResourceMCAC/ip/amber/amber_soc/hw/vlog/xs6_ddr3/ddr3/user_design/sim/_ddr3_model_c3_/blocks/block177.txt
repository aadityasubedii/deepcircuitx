Comment: 
This block of code implements a clocked process, which is triggered on the positive edge of signal `dqs_odd[14]`. On every positive transition of this signal, it executes the `dqs_odd_receiver` function with the parameter `14`. The function call to `dqs_odd_receiver(14)` indicates a specific signal processing or data handling task which is being performed for the 15th element (index 14) of the `dqs_odd` array.
