Module name: cmd_gen. Module specification: The cmd_gen module is a command generator for memory interfaces, supporting various FPGA families (Spartan-6 and Virtex-6) and configurable for different data widths and burst lengths. It generates memory commands (read, write, refresh) with various addressing modes (fixed, sequential, PRBS) and burst lengths. The module takes inputs such as clk_i, rst_i, run_traffic_i, rd_buff_avail_i, start_addr_i, end_addr_i, and various configuration signals for address, data, and instruction modes. It outputs addr_o, instr_o, bl_o, and cmd_o_vld signals. Internally, it uses counters, PRBS generators, and control logic to manage address generation, instruction selection, and burst length determination. The module is divided into sections for address generation
