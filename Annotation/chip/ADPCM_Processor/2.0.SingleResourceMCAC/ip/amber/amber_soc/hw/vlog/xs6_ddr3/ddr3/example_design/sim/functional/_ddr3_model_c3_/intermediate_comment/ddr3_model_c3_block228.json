    "block_comment": "The function block in Verilog, named `get_rtt_nom`, calculates the nominal Round-Trip-Time (RTT) based on the value of the input `rtt` that ranges from 1 to 5 and has a default case. The function performs this by evaluating the input `rtt` in a case statement structure and assigns the quotient of `RZQ` (a predefined constant) divided by a corresponding integer output. Huffman code from 1 to 5 maps to `RZQ` divided by 4,2,6,12 & 8 respectively. If the `rtt` value doesn't fall within the range of 1 to 5, the function returns 0 by default."
