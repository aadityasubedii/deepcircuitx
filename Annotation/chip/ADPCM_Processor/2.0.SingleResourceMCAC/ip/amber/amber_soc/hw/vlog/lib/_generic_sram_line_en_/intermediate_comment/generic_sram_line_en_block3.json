    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is used for initialization purposes. If the parameter INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO is true, then the code block labeled 'init0' will be executed. This block includes the declaration of an integer 'i' and an initial block. This is a common technique used in hardware design to conditionally execute certain code blocks based on the values of the parameters. The initial block, though not fully shown here, is typically used for initialization of values or configuration setup."
