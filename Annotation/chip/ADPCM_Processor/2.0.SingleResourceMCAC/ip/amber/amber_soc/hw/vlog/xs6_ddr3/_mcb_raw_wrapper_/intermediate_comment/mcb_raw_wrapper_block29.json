    "block_comment": "This block primarily sets up a series of OSERDES2 (Output Serializer/Deserializer) instances gen_addr_oserdes2 in a loop for address serialization. Each OSERDES2 is parameterized with constants like data rates, output mode, serdes mode and data width. Each instance, ioi_addr_0, maps the serialized output, address_90, to an output queue, ioi_addr, given a set of conditions defined by ioclk0 (the clock signal), pll_ce_0 and int_sys_rst (the reset signal). The mapping uses TQ and the D inputs in the design. Other inputs and outputs are set to default (mostly '0') pushing this model towards a simplistic implementation."
