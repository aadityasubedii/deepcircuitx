    "block_comment": "The block of code handles the process of acknowledgment in a data transmission setup. Using the 'always' keyword, it continually checks conditions for updating the 'ack_owed_r' signal on every rising edge of the input clock signal 'i_clk'. If the push operation is active and a write request is being made, without an acknowledgment ('o_ack') being made previously, then 'ack_owed_r' is set to 1, indicating an acknowledgment is due. Conversely, if an acknowledgment is received and no new request ('i_req') is made, the 'ack_owed_r' is reset to 0, showing no acknowledgment is due."
