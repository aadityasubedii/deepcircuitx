    "block_comment": "This block of code is a clock-triggered counter incrementer. On every rising edge of the input clock signal ('clk_i'), it updates the 'INC_COUNTS' register with the value derived from the division of the 'DWIDTH' parameter by 8. This operation effectively scales down the 'DWIDTH' parameter and periodically updates 'INC_COUNTS' with that value at every clock cycle."
