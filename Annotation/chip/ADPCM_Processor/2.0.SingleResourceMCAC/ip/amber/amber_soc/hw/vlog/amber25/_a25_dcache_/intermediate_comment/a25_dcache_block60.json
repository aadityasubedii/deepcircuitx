    "block_comment": "This block is a register that captures and stores a miss address when a cache request is not found in the cache or there is a write operation to a cached address. The register latches the 'i_address' input on the positive edge of 'i_clk' if either 'o_wb_cached_req' is true (indicating a cache request that has not been fulfilled) or 'write_hit' is true (indicating a write operation hit a cached address)."
