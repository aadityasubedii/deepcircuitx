The module mainly tracks and manages different Ethernet transmission aspects like CRC errors, frame lengths, receiver/transmitter states, collision states, retry count, loopbacks etc. The goal is to provide a robust and accurate status reporting mechanism to the main MAC controller to assure high quality and reliable data transmission. It seems to effectively latch and manage various flag signals, counters, and states associated with both Ethernet receiving (Rx) and transmitting (Tx) sides, through a large number of registers."
