Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable memory controller wrapper for DDR3 SDRAM interfaces. It supports up to 6 ports with customizable data widths, handling memory initialization, calibration, and data transfer. The module instantiates an mcb_ui_top core for memory controller functionality, manages clock domains, and provides interfaces for both custom and AXI protocols. It includes parameters for timing, memory type, and interface attributes, allowing for flexible configuration to meet various system requirements.
