    "block_comment": "This block handles the assignments of various MIG P3 bus control signals, either from their respective sources or being disabled, based on the state of C_PORT_ENABLE[3]. If C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is '1', mig_p3_arb_en, and all other variables like mig_p3_cmd_clk, mig_p3_cmd_en etc. are assigned respective values from respective input variables (like p3_arb_en, p3_cmd_clk etc.). Special case for mig_p3_cmd_bl where part of the assigned value comes from logical OR of p3_cmd_instr and p3_cmd_bl input variable. If C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is not '1', each of the signals is driven low ('b0).```"
