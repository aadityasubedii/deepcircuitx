    "block_comment": "This block of code is a multiplexer that selects between two possible pll_lock signals based on the condition of normal_operation_window. If normal_operation_window is active, it outputs the pll_lock signal. Otherwise, it outputs the syn_uiclk_pll_lock signal. It achieves this by using an always block that makes the logic sensitive to changes of any signals in the block, making the output, gated_pll_lock, update instantaneously based on the condition of normal_operation_window."
