    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a write buffer logic in a memory subsystem. Upon each positive edge of the clock (`i_clk`), if a write request (`write_request`) is received and the command buffer (`i_cmd_full`) is full, it loads the input data (`i_wb_dat`), address (`i_wb_adr`), and select values (`i_wb_sel`) into their respective output buffers for further processing or integration into the memory subsystem."
