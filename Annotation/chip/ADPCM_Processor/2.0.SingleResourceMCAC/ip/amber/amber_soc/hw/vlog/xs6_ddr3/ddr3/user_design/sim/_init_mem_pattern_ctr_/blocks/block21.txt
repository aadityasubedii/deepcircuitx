This block of code is responsible for controlling the address pointer of a memory block. On the rising edge of the input clock, if the reset input is set, it initializes the current address pointer to a predefined 'BEGIN_ADDRESS'. If not, it checks whether the 'mcb_wr_en_i' is given and the machine is in the 'INIT_MEM_WRITE' state with 'WR_MODE' or 'BI_MODE' specified, or it is in the 'IDLE' state with 'RD_MODE' specified, then it increments the current address pointer by a granular predefined 'INC_COUNTS'. In other cases, it retains the same current address.
