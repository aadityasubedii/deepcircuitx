    "block_comment": "This block of code is for conditional checking in a `generate` statement in Verilog. It checks whether the `FAMILY` parameter is `\"SPARTAN6\"`. If the condition is met, a named block `INC_COUNTS_S` starts. The functionality might be to incorporate a specific set of designs or conditions only suitable for the \"SPARTAN6\" FPGA family and these would be implemented inside the `INC_COUNTS_S` block."
