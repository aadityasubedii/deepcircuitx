    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code regulates and coordinates the read/write (Rx/Tx) operations in a memory system with a built-in logic to reset and enable (En) transactions. The block works on the positive edge of a clock signal (WB_CLK_I) or a reset. On reset, all the enable signals are set to their initial state, and address and data inputs to the memory are cleared. Otherwise, depending on the state of the WbEn_q, RxEn_q, TxEn_q, RxEn_needed, and TxEn_needed signals, it sets the enable and address/data commands for the memory system accordingly and controls the access to data buffers (BDRead, BDWrite)."
