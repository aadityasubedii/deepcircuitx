    "block_comment": "The code block is used to determine if a cache hit has occurred, specifically for an 8-way set associative cache configuration. It achieves this by launching the 'check_hit_8ways' named block when the constant 'WAYS' equals 8 -- indicating that the cache is operating in an 8-way set associative mode. It is likely to contain comparisons between some input data and stored cache block data to determine if the requested data already exists in cache."
