The given Verilog code block is designed for handling the system reset operation. It utilizes a ternary operator expression to decide the reset mode. If `C3_RST_ACT_LOW` is true, then the low-activated reset model is used, in other words, `c3_sys_rst` is directly used to drive the system reset. Otherwise, if `C3_RST_ACT_LOW` is false, then it signifies a high-activated reset model and the negation of `c3_sys_rst`, denoted by `~c3_sys_rst`, is employed to drive the system reset.
