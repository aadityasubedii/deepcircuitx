    "block_comment": "This block of code invokes a check on any changes to the 31st bit of the input data (dq_in). The block utilizes a sensitivity list with the always keyword. This keyword guarantees that the function dq_timing_check(30) is called every time there's a change in the value of dq_in[30]. This real-time monitoring upholds the integrity of the input data stream by ensuring the 31st bit is valid and precise."
