This block of code manages a Pause Timer in a system, which can be reset, set or decremented. Upon a positive edge transition of the system's MRxClk signal or a high Reset signal, the block checks if the Reset signal is active; if so, it resets PauseTimer to zero. If the SetPauseTimer signal is active instead, it sets the PauseTimer value to the latched timer value. Lastly, if DecrementPauseTimer signal is active, it decreases PauseTimer by 1. The block uses non-blocking assignments to avoid race conditions.
