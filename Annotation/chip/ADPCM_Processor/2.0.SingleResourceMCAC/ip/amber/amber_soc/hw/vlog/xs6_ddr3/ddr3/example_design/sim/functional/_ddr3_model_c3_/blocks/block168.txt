The block conducts a timing check of a command (cmd) address based on write enable (we_n_in) signals. The implementation is realized by an always block that activates with any change in the we_n_in signal. The timing evaluation is done through the cmd_addr_timing_check function where the constant value 3 is passed as the time delay parameter for the command address.
