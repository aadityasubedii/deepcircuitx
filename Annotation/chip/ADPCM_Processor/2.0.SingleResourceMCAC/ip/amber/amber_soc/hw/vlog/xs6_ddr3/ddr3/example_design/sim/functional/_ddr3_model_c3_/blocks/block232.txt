Comment: 
This code block is a simple digital circuit for detecting rising edge of the clock signal, `ck_n_in`. It takes the negation of the input clock signal `ck_n_in` at every positive edge of the clock and assigns it to the output signal `diff_ck`. This is implemented with the always @ command which assigns values based on triggered events. Upon a positive edge detection (posedge) of the input clock signal, the negation of the clock signal is computed and stored in the `diff_ck` register, effectively establishing edge detection.
