    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for assigning a value to `xSOURCE_SEL` based on a selected source. It utilizes conditional statements to assign the value. If `source_sel[C_CORE]` is true then `xSOURCE_SEL` is assigned `\"C_CORE\"`. If `source_sel[C_INIT]` is true, `xSOURCE_SEL` is assigned `\"C_INIT\"`. Similarly, if `source_sel[C_FILL]` or `source_sel[C_INVA]` is true, `xSOURCE_SEL` is assigned `\"C_FILL\"` or `\"C_INVA\"`, respectively. If none of the aforementioned conditions are true, `xSOURCE_SEL` is assigned `\"UNKNOWN\"`."
