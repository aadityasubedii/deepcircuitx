This block of code is a flip-flop circuit with asynchronous reset functionality, used in the end frame of a receiver logic (RxEndFrm). If the Reset signal is high, the end frames (RxEndFrm, RxEndFrm_d) are forcibly set to 0. However, when the reset is not active, the code captures the value of GenerateRxEndFrm at every positive edge of the MRxClk (Media Receive Clock). The RxEndFrm signal is set to the logical OR of RxEndFrm_d and DribbleRxEndFrm.
