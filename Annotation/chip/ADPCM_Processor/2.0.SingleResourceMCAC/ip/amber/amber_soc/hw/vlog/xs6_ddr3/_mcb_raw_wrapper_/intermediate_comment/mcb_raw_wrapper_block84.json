    "block_comment": "This block of code generates an internal system reset signal (int_sys_rst). It does this by assigning the logical OR of the system reset signal (sys_rst) and the negated phase-locked loop (PLL) lock signal (~gated_pll_lock). If either the system reset signal is high, or the PLL is not locked (which produces a high signal after negation), the result will be high, indicating a system reset is necessary."
