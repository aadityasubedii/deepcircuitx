    "block_comment": "This block is a control and data flow management section for interfacing with an external AXI memory controller when AXI is disabled i.e., 'C_S2_AXI_ENABLE == 0'. It assigns various internal variables, such as enable signals, clock signals, instruction commands, availability status of the read and write FIFOs, as well as error states, by directly mapping them to their corresponding external signals. By doing so, it integrates the internal data flow and control paths with the AXI interface, while managing error states and providing feedback in an event of overflow, underflow or any kind of communication errors."
