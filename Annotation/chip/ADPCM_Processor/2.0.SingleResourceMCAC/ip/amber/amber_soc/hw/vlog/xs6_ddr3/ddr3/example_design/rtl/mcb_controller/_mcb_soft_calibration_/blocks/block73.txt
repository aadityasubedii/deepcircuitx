Comment: 
The block assigns `pre_sysrst_minpulse_width_ok` to the fourth bit (index 3 starting from 0) of the `pre_sysrst_cnt` register. The `pre_sysrst_minpulse_width_ok` is used to check whether the `pre_sysrst_cnt` register value has reached the minimum pulse width criteria. The block achieves this by comparing the fourth bit of the `pre_sysrst_cnt` register. If the bit is high, it indicates the count value has reached the threshold value for minimum pulse width.
