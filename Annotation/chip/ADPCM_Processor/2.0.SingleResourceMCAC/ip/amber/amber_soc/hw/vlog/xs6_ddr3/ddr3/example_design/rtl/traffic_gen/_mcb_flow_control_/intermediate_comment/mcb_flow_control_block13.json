    "block_comment": "This block of code is outputting the status of the wdp_valid signal. It does this via the 'assign' keyword that is used in Verilog to establish continuous assignment, thereby ensuring that the value of the signal 'wdp_valid' is consistently reflected on the output 'wdp_valid_o'."
