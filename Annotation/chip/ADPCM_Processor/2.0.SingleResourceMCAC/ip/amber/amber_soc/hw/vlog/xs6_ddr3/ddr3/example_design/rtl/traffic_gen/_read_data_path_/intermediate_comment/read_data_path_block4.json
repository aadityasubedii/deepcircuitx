    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a multiplexer having 8 inputs and 1 output. This multiplexer is basically built using if-else statements, with each if-else branch decides the output based on the presented 'sel' input. It takes an 8-bit input 'in' and a 3-bit selection line 'sel'. Depending on the value on 'sel', an appropriate bit from the 8-bit input is forwarded to the output."
