    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a multiplexer for routing signals in loopback or normal operation modes. Depending on the state of the signal `r_LoopBck`, if it's high (loopback mode) the data present on output lines `mtxd_pad_o[3:0]` are looped back and assigned to `MRxD_Lb[3:0]`, else if it's low (normal operation mode), the data present on input lines `mrxd_pad_i[3:0]` are assigned to `MRxD_Lb[3:0]`."
