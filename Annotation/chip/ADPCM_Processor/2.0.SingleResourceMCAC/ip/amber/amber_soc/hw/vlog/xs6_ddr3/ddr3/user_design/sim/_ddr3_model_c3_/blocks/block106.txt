Comment: 
This block of Verilog code initiates the function `dq_timing_check` whenever there is a change in the 24th bit of the `dq_in` input. Using a sensitivity list, the `always` statement monitors changes in bit 24 of the input vector `dq_in` and calls the `dq_timing_check` function with integer 24 as an argument to perform any necessary checks or operations on change detection.
