Module-level comment: The 'generic_iobuf' module serves as an input-output buffer managing bidirectional data transmission by dynamically controlling the behavior of the 'IO' pin. It achieves this by using two input ports 'I' and 'T'; 'I' is assigned to 'IO' when 'T' is 0 and 'IO' becomes high impedance (Z) when 'T' is 1. The output port 'O' reflects the state of 'IO'.
