Comment: 
This block of code manages read data bursts in write back stage in synchronous with the clock signal 'i_clk'. At every positive edge of the clock, when the 'i_wb_stall' signal is NOT asserted (i.e., it is false), data from the 'i_wb_read_data' signal as well as the older burst data held in 'wb_rdata_burst' (right shifted by 32 bits) is concatenated and stored back into 'wb_rdata_burst'. This effectively constitutes a shift register implementation, allowing for a burst mode data transfer.
