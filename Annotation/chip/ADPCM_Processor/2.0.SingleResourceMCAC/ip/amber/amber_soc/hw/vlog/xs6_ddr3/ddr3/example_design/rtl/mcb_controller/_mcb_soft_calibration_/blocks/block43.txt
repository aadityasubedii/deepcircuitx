Comment: 
This block of code initiates a memory write operation in broadcast mode. First, it sets the address of the memory cell to "NTerm". The write data is specified by concatenating '00' with the variable 'N_Term'. A write operation is initiated by setting the 'IODRPCTRLR_R_WB' bit to 'WRITE_MODE'. The commands 'MCB_CMD_VALID' and 'MCB_USE_BKST' are activated indicating the write operation is valid and should use the backstore. 'MCB_UIDRPUPDATE' bit is set based on the negation of 'First_In_Term_Done'. Depending on whether 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N' is true or false, the state machine transitions to 'BROADCAST_NTERM' or 'WAIT6' state respectively.
