    "spec": "Module name: a25_wishbone. \n\nModule Specification: The 'a25_wishbone' module is a hardware design primarily created to manage multiple wishbone protocol requests from three different ports. The primary function of this module is to act as an interface and address buffer that accommodates, prioritizes, and processes protocol requests based on the order of their arrival. It executes both reading and write operations on these ports and every operation is clock-driven, indicating they\u2019re initiated on every positive edge of the clock.\n\nAmong the multitude of input ports in the module are i_clk, i_reset, i_port0_req, i_port1_req, i_port2_req, i_port0_write, i_port1_write, i_port2_write, i_port0_wdata, i_port1_wdata, i_port2_wdata, i_port0_be, i_port1_be, i_port2_be, i_port0_addr, i_port1_addr, i_port2_addr, i_wb_dat, i_wb_ack, i_wb_err. These ports serve various functions such as driving the timing of the system (i_clk), initializing the system (i_reset), determining whether the operation for each port is a read or write, holding the incoming write data for each of the three ports and returning error status from the core interacting with the wishbone.\n\nSimultaneously, the output ports include o_port0_ack, o_port1_ack, o_port2_ack, o_port0_rdata, o_port1_rdata, o_port2_rdata, o_wb_adr, o_wb_sel, o_wb_we, o_wb_dat, o_wb_cyc, o_wb_stb, which acknowledge the requests from each of the three ports, select which byte to interact with on the data bus, indicate a write cycle and provide data to the core interacting with the wishbone.\n\nOn the other hand, internal signals like WBUF, wbuf_valid, wbuf_accepted, wbuf_write, wbuf_wdata, wbuf_be, wbuf_addr, new_access, serving_port signify the validity of the entries in the buffers for each port, assume the buffered addresses for each port\u2019s operation, and indicate which port's buffered request is currently being processed.\n\nThe Verilog RTL code showcases the hierarchical integration of the module a25_wishbone. The main blocks defined are for the input-output ports and the internal processing of data. To assist with data handling, internal instances of another module \"a25_wishbone_buf\" are used. Combining the operation of these designated blocks allows for the effective execution of the module's purpose.",

It receives input request signals from multiple ports and acknowledges them. The module maintains a buffer for data, byte enables, and addresses for the write operations requested by the ports. It also manages data read operations on these ports. It assigns priority for device access based on which port's request comes first. When there's new access, the module processes valid data from the buffer in a sequential manner starting from the first buffer slot.

WBUF: This is a local parameter defined as '3'. It has been used to specify the size of buffers created for storing data, byte enables, and addresses from various ports.\n\n2. wbuf_valid: This signal is a 1-bit wide wire that signifies the validity of the entries in the buffers for each port. If an entry's valid bit is set, it means the value that has been written to the buffer position is valid and should be processed.\n\n3. wbuf_accepted: This signifies if the data in the buffer has been accepted for further processing.\n\n4. wbuf_write: This 1-bit wide wire indicates whether the operation for each buffered request is a write operation.\n\n5. wbuf_wdata: This is the buffer for storing the incoming write data each port is to perform.\n\n6. wbuf_be: These signals are holding the buffered byte enables for each data word for each port.\n\n7. wbuf_addr: These hold the buffered addresses for each port's data read or write operation.\n\n8. wbuf_rdata_valid: This holds the status of read data validity from specific buffer of each port.\n\n9. new_access: This is a decision signal that tells if there is an access request (not the old access or it's a new access when previous access is acknowledged).\n\n10. serving_port: This 3-bit wide register is for indicating which port's buffered request is currently being served or processed. If it equals to '3b001', then port 0 is being served, '3b010' for port 1, and '3b100' for port 2. '3b000' represents no active service."

It receives input request signals from multiple ports and acknowledges them. The module maintains a buffer for data, byte enables, and addresses for the write operations requested by the ports. It also manages data read operations on these ports. It assigns priority for device access based on which port's request comes first. When there's new access, the module processes valid data from the buffer in a sequential manner starting from the first buffer slot. The module is clock-driven, updating buffer operation and wishbone signals on every positive edge of the clock."

WBUF: This is a local parameter defined as '3'. It has been used to specify the size of buffers created for storing data, byte enables, and addresses from various ports.\n\n2. wbuf_valid: This signal is a 1-bit wide wire that signifies the validity of the entries in the buffers for each port. If an entry's valid bit is set, it means the value that has been written to the buffer position is valid and should be processed.\n\n3. wbuf_accepted: This signifies if the data in the buffer has been accepted for further processing.\n\n4. wbuf_write: This 1-bit wide wire indicates whether the operation for each buffered request is a write operation.\n\n5. wbuf_wdata: This is the buffer for storing the incoming write data each port is to perform.\n\n6. wbuf_be: These signals are holding the buffered byte enables for each data word for each port.\n\n7. wbuf_addr: These hold the buffered addresses for each port's data read or write operation.\n\n8. wbuf_rdata_valid: This holds the status of read data validity from specific buffer of each port.\n\n9. new_access: This is a decision signal that tells if there is an access request (not the old access or it's a new access when previous access is acknowledged).\n\n10. serving_port: This 3-bit wide register is for indicating which port's buffered request is currently being served or processed. If it equals to '3b001', then port 0 is being served, '3b010' for port 1, and '3b100' for port 2. '3b000' represents no active service."

The primary function of this module is to act as an interface and address buffer that accommodates, prioritizes, and processes protocol requests based on the order of their arrival. It executes both reading and write operations on these ports and every operation is clock-driven, indicating they\u2019re initiated on every positive edge of the clock.\n\nAmong the multitude of input ports in the module are i_clk, i_reset, i_port0_req, i_port1_req, i_port2_req, i_port0_write, i_port1_write, i_port2_write, i_port0_wdata, i_port1_wdata, i_port2_wdata, i_port0_be, i_port1_be, i_port2_be, i_port0_addr, i_port1_addr, i_port2_addr, i_wb_dat, i_wb_ack, i_wb_err. These ports serve various functions such as driving the timing of the system (i_clk), initializing the system (i_reset), determining whether the operation for each port is a read or write, holding the incoming write data for each of the three ports and returning error status from the core interacting with the wishbone.\n\nSimultaneously, the output ports include o_port0_ack, o_port1_ack, o_port2_ack, o_port0_rdata, o_port1_rdata, o_port2_rdata, o_wb_adr, o_wb_sel, o_wb_we, o_wb_dat, o_wb_cyc, o_wb_stb, which acknowledge the requests from each of the three ports, select which byte to interact with on the data bus, indicate a write cycle and provide data to the core interacting with the wishbone.\n\nOn the other hand, internal signals like WBUF, wbuf_valid, wbuf_accepted, wbuf_write, wbuf_wdata, wbuf_be, wbuf_addr, new_access, serving_port signify the validity of the entries in the buffers for each port, assume the buffered addresses for each port\u2019s operation, and indicate which port's buffered request is currently being processed.\n\nThe Verilog RTL code showcases the hierarchical integration of the module a25_wishbone. The main blocks defined are for the input-output ports and the internal processing of data. To assist with data handling, internal instances of another module \"a25_wishbone_buf\" are used. Combining the operation of these designated blocks allows for the effective execution of the module's purpose."
