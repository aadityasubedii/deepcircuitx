The block checks the status of the "cs_n_in" signal and initiates a command address timing check when there is any change in the "cs_n_in" signal. This is implemented using an always block that gets triggered whenever the signal "cs_n_in" experiences a change (positive or negative edge). The block calls the "cmd_addr_timing_check" procedure with 0 as an argument every time this happens.
