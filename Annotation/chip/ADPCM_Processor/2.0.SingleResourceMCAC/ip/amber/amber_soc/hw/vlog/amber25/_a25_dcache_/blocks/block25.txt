Comment: 
This Verilog RTL block captures the valid bits from three ways of a set-associative cache when the system is in IDLE state upon detection of a rising clock edge. Inside an always block, which triggers on a positive edge clock signal, a conditional statement checks if the current state is IDLE. When the system is in the IDLE state, it assigns the highest (most-significant bit), designated as validity information, from tags associated with each of the three ways of the cache to the 'valid_bits_r' register.
