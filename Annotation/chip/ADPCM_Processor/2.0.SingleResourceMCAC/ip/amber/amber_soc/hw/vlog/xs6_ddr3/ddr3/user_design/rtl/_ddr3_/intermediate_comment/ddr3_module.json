    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/* \nThis module implements a DDR3 memory controller interface. It instantiates \ninfrastructure and memory controller wrapper submodules to handle DDR3 SDRAM \noperations. The module provides multiple configurable command, write, and read \nports (p0-p5) for interfacing with DDR3 memory. It manages clock generation, \nreset control, and PLL operations, and handles memory calibration and various \nDDR3 interface signals. The module is highly parameterized to allow flexible \nconfiguration of timing, port settings, and memory characteristics.\n*/"
