Comment: 
This is a single line of Verilog RTL code which operates as a condition check block. It assigns the control signal, 'wb_hit', based on satisfying certain conditions in the system's write-back stage. This is done by comparing 'i_address' with 'wb_address', ensuring 'i_wb_ready' is high, and verifying 'fill_state'. If all these conditions are satisfied simultaneously, 'wb_hit' will be asserted true, indicating a successful write-back. This logic implementation helps optimize execution performance, by confirming when it's appropriate to proceed with writing data back into memory from the cache.
