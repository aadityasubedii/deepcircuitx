    "block_comment": "The Verilog code block generates an internal system reset signal, `int_sys_rst`. The internal reset is asserted when either the `sys_rst` is active or the gated Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) isn't locked, represented by the inverted `gated_pll_lock` signal. The use of the bitwise OR operator (`|`) ensures that `int_sys_rst` is active when at least one of these conditions is fulfilled."
