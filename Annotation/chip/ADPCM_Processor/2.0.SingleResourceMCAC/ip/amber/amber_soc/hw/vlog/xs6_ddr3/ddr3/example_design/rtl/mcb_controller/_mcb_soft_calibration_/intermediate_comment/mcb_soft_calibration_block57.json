    "block_comment": "This block of code is a state machine handling memory interface initialization and calibration. Initially, it enables User Command (MCB_UICMDEN) and negates the completing flag (MCB_UIDONECAL). It also resets termination values (P_Term and N_Term) and sets system reset flag (Pre_SYSRST). If input termination calibration is skipped (SKIP_IN_TERM_CAL), it transitions to the \"WAIT_FOR_START_BROADCAST\" state while keeping termination values at null. If the input/output (IO) datapath ready signal (IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N) is high, it transits to the \"LOAD_RZQ_NTERM\" state, otherwise it keeps itself in the \"START\" state."
