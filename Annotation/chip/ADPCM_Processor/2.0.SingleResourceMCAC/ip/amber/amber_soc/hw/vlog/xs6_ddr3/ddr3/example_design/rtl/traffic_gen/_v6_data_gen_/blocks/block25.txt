This block of code generates a particular data pattern if specific conditions regarding the number of data query (DQ) pins and the data pattern type are met. If there are 120 DQ pins and the data pattern type is either, "DGEN_NEIGHBOR", "DGEN_WALKING1", "DGEN_WALKING0", "DGEN_ALL", the named pattern "WALKING_ONE_120_PATTERN" is generated. This pattern is activated on the rising edge of the input clock, as defined by always@(posedge clk_i).
