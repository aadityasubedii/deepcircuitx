    "block_comment": "This block defines an assignment in Verilog for an output signal called 'data_error_o'. The signal 'data_error_o' is assigned the value of the signal 'data_error'. This block mainly operates as a conduit, passing the 'data_error' signal externally through 'data_error_o'. This function is achieved through Verilog's continuous assignment statement, 'assign', which sets 'data_error_o' equal to 'data_error' continuously throughout the simulation."
