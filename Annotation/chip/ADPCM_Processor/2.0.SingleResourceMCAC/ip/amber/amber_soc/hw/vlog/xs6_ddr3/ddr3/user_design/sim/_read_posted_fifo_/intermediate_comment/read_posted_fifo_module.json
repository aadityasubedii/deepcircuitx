    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'read_posted_fifo' module controls and manages FIFO data storage interface for FPGA and ASIC designs. It uses input controls and parameters, internal signals, and an integrated 'afifo' module to perform read and write operations with command readiness and data validity checks. It can handle data conflicts with checks for FIFO full/empty status and houses specific adaptations for device families like \"SPARTAN6\". The module employs delay-based sequential logic to maintain timing requirements. It provides output of fetched data validity, address, block lengths and readiness for next command along with buffer space availability."
