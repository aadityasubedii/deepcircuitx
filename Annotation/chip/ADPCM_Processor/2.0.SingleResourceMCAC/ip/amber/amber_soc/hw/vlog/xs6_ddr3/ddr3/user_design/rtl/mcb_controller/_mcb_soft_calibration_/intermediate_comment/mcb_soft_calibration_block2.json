    "block_comment": "The block of code is functionally responsible for handling the state of Active_IODRP register based on several different scenarios. Through a case-control structure, the block determines how to set outputs RZQ_IODRP_CS, ZIO_IODRP_CS, and IODRP_SDO based on the current state of Active_IODRP. When Active_IODRP is in RZQ mode, it forwards signal from IODRP_CS to RZQ_IODRP_CS, and sets IODRP_SDO to RZQ_IODRP_SDO while ZIO_IODRP_CS is reset to '0'. Conversely, in ZIO mode, signals are forwarded to ZIO_IODRP_CS and IODRP_SDO is set as ZIO_IODRP_SDO with RZQ_IODRP_CS being reset. Lastly, for MCB_PORT and any other (default) state, all the outputs RZQ_IODRP_CS, ZIO_IODRP_CS, and IODRP_SDO are reset."
