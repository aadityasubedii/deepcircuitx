The block is used to schedule the calling of subroutine `cmd_addr_timing_check(14)` whenever changes are detected on the 8th bit (bit number 7, as counting starts from 0) of `addr_in` signal. This block's functioning is realized using the behavioral description model "always @", a standard Verilog hardware construct, that in this case specifically monitors the 8th bit of `addr_in`, triggering `cmd_addr_timing_check(14)` accordingly.
