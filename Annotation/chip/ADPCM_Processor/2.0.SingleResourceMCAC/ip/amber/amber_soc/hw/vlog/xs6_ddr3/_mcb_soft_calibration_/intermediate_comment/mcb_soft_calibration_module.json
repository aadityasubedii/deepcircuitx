    "module": "Module-level comment: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), including input termination and dynamic DQS delay calibration. It uses a state machine to sequence through calibration steps, adjusting termination values and DQS delays. The module interacts with IODRP controllers to read/write calibration values, implements complex calibration algorithms, and handles self-refresh operations. It optimizes signal integrity and timing for the memory interface by adapting to variations in operating conditions."
