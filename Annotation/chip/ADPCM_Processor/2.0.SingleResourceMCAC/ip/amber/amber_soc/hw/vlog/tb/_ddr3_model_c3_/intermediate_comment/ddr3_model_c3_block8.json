    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs the function of a negative edge timing check. It is executed whenever there is a positive edge detected on the 25th bit (indexed from 0) of the `dqs_in` signal. It does this by invoking the `dqs_neg_timing_check` function with the parameter specified as 24. The outcome of this code block is that the timing of negative edges is controlled and computed, facilitating precise timing measures in the larger system the code is part of."
