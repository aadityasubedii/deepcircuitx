This block implements the I/O interface for a 16-bit DDR memory controller. It instantiates IODRP2_MCB (I/O Dynamic Reconfiguration Port) modules for data (DQ), data strobe (DQS), and data mask (DM) signals. The implementation uses a master-slave configuration for each pair of signals, with delay elements for input calibration. The block handles bidirectional data transfer, input delay adjustment, and output driving for the memory interface, supporting features like dynamic reconfiguration and delay tuning for optimal timing.
