    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code monitors the 14th bit of the 'dm_in' data memory for changes. Whenever there's a change in this bit, the 'dm_timing_check' function with the argument '13' gets triggered for execution. This way, it's ensuring that every update in 'dm_in[13]' gets validated by the 'dm_timing_check' function."
