    "block_comment": "This is a counter circuit in Verilog. The counter has a size of COUNTER_SIZE bits and increments its value on every positive edge of the clk input if the enable input is high. When the reset input is high, the counter resets its value to 0. The counter will hold the count until another count pulse is received. It uses always block to time these operations and if-else construct alongside a casex structure to control the increment, reset, and hold operations."
