    "block_comment": "The given block manages a memory initialization and addressing process. It operates synchronously with the clock, and initializes the `addr_counts` with the `start_addr_i` upon a reset signal or when the current `addr_counts` reaches the `end_addr_i`. If `addr_counts` is less than `end_addr_r`, it gets incremented by `INC_COUNTS`. A flag `mem_init_done` is set to indicate the completion of memory initialization, which is when `addr_counts_next_r` is greater than or equal to `end_addr_i`."
