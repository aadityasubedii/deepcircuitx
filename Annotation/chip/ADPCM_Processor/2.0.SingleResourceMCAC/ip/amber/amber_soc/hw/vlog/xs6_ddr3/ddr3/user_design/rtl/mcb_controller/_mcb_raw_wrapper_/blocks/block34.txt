This block of code implements the functionality related to the training of a memory system. Specifically, it handles the resetting, waiting for a custom timing interval, and the activation of the training process. Upon a positive edge detected in either 'ui_clk' or 'int_sys_rst', the conditional in the block is evaluated. If the system reset 'int_sys_rst' is active, it resets the 'cke_train_reg' to 0. If it's not reset, it checks for the completion of a 200us initial waiting period (when 'wait_200us_done_r1' is true and 'wait_200us_done_r2' is false) to set the 'cke_train_reg' to 1, indicating training started. If 'uo_done_cal' is true, indicating the completion of another calibration event, the 'cke_train_reg' is set back to 0, marking the end of the training.
