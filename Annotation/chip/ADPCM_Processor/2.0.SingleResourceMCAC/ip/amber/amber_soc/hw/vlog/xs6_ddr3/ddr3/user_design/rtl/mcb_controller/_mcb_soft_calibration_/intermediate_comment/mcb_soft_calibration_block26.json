    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the state of the CKE_Train signal, which is manipulated based on various conditions. The processing happens at the positive edge of the UI_CLK signal or when a reset event (RST) occurs. If a reset is high, CKE_Train is set to 0. In the absence of a reset, the code checks if the current state is WAIT_FOR_UODONE and MCB_UODONECAL is true to set CKE_Train to 0. Failing that, it checks if WAIT_200us_COUNTER[15] is true and MCB_UODONECAL is false to set CKE_Train to 1, otherwise, it defaults CKE_Train to 0."
