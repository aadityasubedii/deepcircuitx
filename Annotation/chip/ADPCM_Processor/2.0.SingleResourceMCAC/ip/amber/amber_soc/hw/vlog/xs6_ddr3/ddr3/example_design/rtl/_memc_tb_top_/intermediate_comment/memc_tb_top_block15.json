    "block_comment": "This block of code controls memory traffic generation for port 4 based on a configurable enable condition. If permitted, it initiatively creates patterns in memory within a specified address range and sets a memory traffic generator with custom parameters. A traffic generator and pattern controller are instantiated, reliant on the port width, the memory burst length, the memory column width, and data/command patterns amongst other properties. The block further manages the assignment of command and data seeds, mode values, burst length, and address range. When the traffic generator is not enabled, memory error handling parameters are set to null."
