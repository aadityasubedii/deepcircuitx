    "block_comment": "This block of code performs memory control operations for AXI interfaces. It uses the base address of AXI to manage read/write operations and mask unwanted bits of AXI address. It includes two submodules: `mcb_ui_top_synch`, which synchronizes the calibration done signal, and `axi_mcb`, an interface module for memory controller signals to and from AXI. `axi_mcb` is parameterized according to specific properties like ID width, address width, data width, read/write support, etc. The interface signals for this module include AXI write, read, and response channels (like awid, awaddr, awlen, wdata, bresp, etc.), memory controller commands (like mcb_cmd_clk, mcb_cmd_en, mcb_wr_en, etc.) and other related signals. Appropriate synchronization and parameterization enable seamless memory operations on the AXI bus."
