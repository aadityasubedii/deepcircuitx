    "block_comment": "The block of code defines the digital interface for a DDR2 memory DQ pin out. Data transfers are done in sets of eight data pins (DQ[0] to DQ[7]) and corresponding control pins. Implementation is done using IODRP2_MCB primitives of dual data rate I/O ports for memory controller block operations. Mode selections are juggling between master and slave mode for DQs. This configuration allows data to be written/read in and out of the DDR2 memory. Transmission and output delay parameters are adjustable for fine tuning. Signals are mapped to corresponding output, address, input data, clk, and control signals following the protocol. Additional outputs for upper and lower data masks are included. In the end, specification of `iodrp2_dq_udm` and `iodrp2_dq_ldm` provide control information for data masks."
