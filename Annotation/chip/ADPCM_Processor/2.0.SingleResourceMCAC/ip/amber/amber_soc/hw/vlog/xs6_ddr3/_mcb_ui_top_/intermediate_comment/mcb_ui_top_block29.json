    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing and controlling the clock signal properties for an FPGA device. If the `C_MCB_USE_EXTERNAL_BUFPLL` parameter is set to 0, the `BUFPLL_MCB` (Memory Controller Block Clock Buffer Phase Locked Loop) takes the system clock, doubles its frequency (DIVIDE = 2), and creates two output clock signals (ioclk0 and ioclk180) that are 180 degrees out of phase. Additionally, the `BUFPLL_MCB` generates a lock signal (`pll_lock_bufpll_o`). This is particularly useful for DDR (Double Data Rate) interfacing. If `C_MCB_USE_EXTERNAL_BUFPLL` is not equal to 0, the system clock (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), data clock enable signals (pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90), and the PLL lock signal (pll_lock) are assigned directly."
