Comment: 
This block of code assigns the variable `mcb_ui_clk` the value of `ui_clk`. The assignment is done directly, implying that they are operating on the same clock domain or frequency. The functionality of this code block demonstrates the concept of signal assignment in Verilog, used to propagate changes in one signal (here, `ui_clk`) to another (here, `mcb_ui_clk`). This enables synchronised operation between different aspects of the overall hardware design.
