    "block_comment": "This block handles the enabling/disabling and clocking signals for a memory interface generator (MIG) which also takes in commands from a third-party (p3) system like read address, write data, and command instructions. When the specific condition prior to this code is true, it assigns p3 signals to the corresponding MIG signals, and if the prior condition is not met, it assigns all the MIG signals to zero, effectively disabling them. The block of logic also manipulates signals for read and write operations. It is hence a crucial part of the communication interface between the p3 system and the MIG."
