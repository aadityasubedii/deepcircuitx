    "block_comment": "The block of code is a generate-if construct that dynamically configures the width of the Write-Back Data (WB_DWIDTH) within the design. The block is specifically used when the data width WB_DWIDTH is set to 32 bits. This configurability feature is implemented using Verilog's generate and if keywords, meaning the implemented function will only be added to the design if WB_DWIDTH equals 32."
