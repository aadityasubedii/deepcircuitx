Comment: 
This block of code handles the IO interface (write/read command and data paths) for a memory controller block (MCB) when the AXI interface is disabled (`C_S1_AXI_ENABLE == 0`). It does this by directly mapping the inputs and outputs of the block to their corresponding internal signals. The code includes signals for enabling the arbiter (`p1_arb_en`), writing/reading commands (`p1_cmd_en`, `p1_cmd_instr`, `p1_cmd_bl`, `p1_cmd_byte_addr`), checking the command queue status (`p1_cmd_empty`, `p1_cmd_full`), writing data to MCB (`p1_wr_en`, `p1_wr_mask`, `p1_wr_data`), and reading data from MCB (`p1_rd_en`, `p1_rd_data`), as well as flags for the read/write queue status and error conditions.
