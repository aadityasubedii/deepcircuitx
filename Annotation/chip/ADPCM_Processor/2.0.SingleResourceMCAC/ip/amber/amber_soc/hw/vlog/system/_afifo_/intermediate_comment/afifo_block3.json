    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is for handling reading and writing operations in a synchronous FIFO buffer. Specifically, this block manages the read and write pointers, data output, and full and empty flag outputs. The read ('rd_pointer_wr') and write ('wr_pointer_rd') pointers are determined by un-graying respective delayed pointers ('rd_pointer_d2', 'wr_pointer_d2'). The data output ('o_data') is selected based on the least significant two bits of the read pointer ('rd_pointer'). The full flag ('o_full') is asserted when the read pointer equals the inverse of certain bits of the write pointer. The empty flag ('o_empty') is asserted when the read pointer equals the de-grayed write pointer."
