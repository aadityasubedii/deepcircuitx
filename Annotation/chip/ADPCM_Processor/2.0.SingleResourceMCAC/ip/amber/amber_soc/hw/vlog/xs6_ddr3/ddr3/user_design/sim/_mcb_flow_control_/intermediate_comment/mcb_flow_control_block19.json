    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code manages the state of 'cmd_en_r1' signal on the positive edge of a clock signal. It employs synchronous reset logic, where 'cmd_en_r1' is reset when the 9th bit of 'rst_i' is set. It also features sequential set and reset conditions realized by 'xfer_cmd' and 'mcb_cmd_full' signals respectively. The '#TCQ' defines the delay of the assignment."
