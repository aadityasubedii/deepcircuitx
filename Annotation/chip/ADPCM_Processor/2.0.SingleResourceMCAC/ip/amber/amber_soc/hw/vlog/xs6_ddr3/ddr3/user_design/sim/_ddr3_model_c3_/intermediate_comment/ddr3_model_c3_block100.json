    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code handles dynamic adjustment of timing related to signal 'dq_in[30]'. It does this by invoking a user-defined procedure 'dq_timing_check' with '30' as an argument whenever there's a change detected in the 31st bit of the 'dq_in' signal. This ensures that the specific bit's timing remains correct and up-to-date with regard to the system requirements. Use the original code to better understand the interaction between this check and other parts of the system."
