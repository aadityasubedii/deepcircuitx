    "spec": "Module name: `a23_coprocessor`.\nModule specification: \n\nThe `a23_coprocessor` module is a vital part of a hardware design, intended to handle caching operations. The purpose of this module is to manage operations like enabling/disabling cache, flushing cache, and updating specific areas in cache based on the opcode inputs. \n\nThis module accepts various input ports such as `i_clk` as input clock signal, `i_fetch_stall` to stall the fetch operations, `i_copro_opcode1`, `i_copro_opcode2`, `i_copro_crn`, `i_copro_crm`, `i_copro_num` to set the operation type, operation and register addresses, `i_copro_write_data` to feed data to be written. Additionally, the module considers `i_fault`, `i_fault_status`, and `i_fault_address` to analyze fault conditions. \n\nThe output ports of this module provide the control signals and parameters essential for other components in the system. The `o_copro_read_data` port provides the data read from the module, `o_cache_enable` facilitates cache enabling/disabling, `o_cache_flush` initiates cache flush operation, and `o_cacheable_area` holds the cacheable memory area data.\n\nThe module consists of various internal signals including `cache_control`, `cacheable_area`, `updateable_area`, `disruptive_area`, `fault_status`, `fault_address`, `copro15_reg1_write`, `copro_operation_d1`, and `copro_crn_d1`, which are instrumental in controlling different cache areas, registering faults, and managing various operations within the coprocessor module itself. \n\nThe code has logically structured blocks facilitating multiple functional aspects of the coprocessor such as handling fault conditions, managing cache control, cacheable area, updateable area, disruptive area based on opcode and crn inputs, and handling debugging tasks. The module also has precise control of writing/reading operations, and updateable or disruptive area definitions. Its debugging functionality adds value by providing visibility into the operations of write/read instructions, faults handling, and cache control management.",

The purpose of this module is to manage operations like enabling/disabling cache, flushing cache, and updating specific areas in cache based on the opcode inputs. \n\nThis module accepts various input ports such as `i_clk` as input clock signal, `i_fetch_stall` to stall the fetch operations, `i_copro_opcode1`, `i_copro_opcode2`, `i_copro_crn`, `i_copro_crm`, `i_copro_num` to set the operation type, operation and register addresses, `i_copro_write_data` to feed data to be written. Additionally, the module considers `i_fault`, `i_fault_status`, and `i_fault_address` to analyze fault conditions. \n\nThe output ports of this module provide the control signals and parameters essential for other components in the system. The `o_copro_read_data` port provides the data read from the module, `o_cache_enable` facilitates cache enabling/disabling, `o_cache_flush` initiates cache flush operation, and `o_cacheable_area` holds the cacheable memory area data.\n\nThe module consists of various internal signals including `cache_control`, `cacheable_area`, `updateable_area`, `disruptive_area`, `fault_status`, `fault_address`, `copro15_reg1_write`, `copro_operation_d1`, and `copro_crn_d1`, which are instrumental in controlling different cache areas, registering faults, and managing various operations within the coprocessor module itself. \n\nThe code has logically structured blocks facilitating multiple functional aspects of the coprocessor such as handling fault conditions, managing cache control, cacheable area, updateable area, disruptive area based on opcode and crn inputs, and handling debugging tasks. The module also has precise control of writing/reading operations, and updateable or disruptive area definitions. Its debugging functionality adds value by providing visibility into the operations of write/read instructions, faults handling, and cache control management."
