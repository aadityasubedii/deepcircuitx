    "block_comment": "The function `floor` is used to implement a floor operation on an input number, effectively rounding it down. Looking into its implementation, it accepts a real number as its input and returns an integer number. This function utilizes Verilog's built-in `$rtoi` function to convert the real number to an integer, and applies an `if` condition to ascertain whether the original input number is smaller than the integer after the conversion. If the condition is met, `$rtoi(number) - 1` is assigned to `floor` as output; otherwise, the original input number is directly returned as the `floor`."
