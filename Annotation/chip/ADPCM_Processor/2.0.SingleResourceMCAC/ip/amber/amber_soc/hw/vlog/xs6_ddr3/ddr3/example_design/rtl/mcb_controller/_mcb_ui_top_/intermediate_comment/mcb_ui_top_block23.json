    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog RTL code deals with the generation and management of AXI addressing, control, and data signals in a memory controller block (MCB) for two conditions. When the AXI interface is disabled (C_S1_AXI_ENABLE == 0), the block directly maps certain incoming signals like the arbitration enable, command clock, write enable, read data etc., to the corresponding internal signals. If the AXI interface is enabled, the block processes an Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) transaction, involving memory addressing and data read/write operations. Processed signals include address mapping and accessing data from the command, write, and read buses. A module axi_mcb is instantiated with parameters appropriate to the Spartan6 family for managing AXI transactions. The synchronization of calibration done signal is also achieved through another instantiated module mcb_ui_top_synch."
