This block is used to set a flag indicating that a test status action occurred. It is implemented using a sequential always block under the positive edge of the clock. The flag `test_status_set` gets set to `1` when a write operation is initiated (`wb_start_write` is true) on the address that equals to `AMBER_TEST_STATUS`.
