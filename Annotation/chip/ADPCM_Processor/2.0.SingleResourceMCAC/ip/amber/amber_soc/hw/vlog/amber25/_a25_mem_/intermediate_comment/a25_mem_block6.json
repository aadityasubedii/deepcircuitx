    "block_comment": "This block of code deals with the process of stalling specifically in fetch-only mode within an operation cycle. Whenever there is a rising edge detected in the i_clk (input clock), the system assigns the value of fetch_only_stall to fetch_only_stall_r. Consequently, the fetch_only_stall_r serves to maintain the state of fetch_only_stall from one clock cycle to the next, thereby implementing the stalling mechanism in fetch-only mode."
