    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the condition where the memory type is not 'DDR2'. In implementation, it uses a generate-if construct that will conditionally generate netlist depending on the specified condition. When the condition C_MEM_TYPE not equal to \"DDR2\" is true, it will create a generate block labeled as gen_cketrain_b."
