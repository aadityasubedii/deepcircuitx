    "block_comment": "This block handles the synchronization of the CrcHash variable: a six-bit vector reset and value assignment operation. At every positive edge of MRxClk, when the reset signal is high or system is in idle state, CrcHash variable is reset by setting all its bits to zero after the propagation delay, Tp. However, if the system is in Data state indicating by the first bit of StateData being 1 and ByteCntEq6 is true, the CrcHash updates its value to be equal to the upper 6 bits of the Crc vector after the propagation delay, Tp."
