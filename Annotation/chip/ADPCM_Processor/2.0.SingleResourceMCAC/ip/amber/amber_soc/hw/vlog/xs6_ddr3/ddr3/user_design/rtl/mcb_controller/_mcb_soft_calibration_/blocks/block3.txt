Comment: 
This logic block monitors for events on either the `UI_CLK` or `MCB_UODATAVALID` signals. Whenever there's a positive edge on either signal, the `MCB_UODATAVALID_U` signal is set to logic high ('1'). Otherwise, the `MCB_UODATAVALID_U` signal gets the most recent value of `MCB_UODATAVALID`. These operations make the block function as a signal latch, capturing and holding the state of `MCB_UODATAVALID` during specific conditions.
