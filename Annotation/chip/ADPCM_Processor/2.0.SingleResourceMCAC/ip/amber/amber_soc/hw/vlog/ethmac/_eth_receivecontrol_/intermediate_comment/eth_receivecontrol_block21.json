    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a sequential logic in a Verilog hardware description which sets the 'OpCodeOK' signal under specific conditions. The signal 'OpCodeOK' is asynchronously reset by 'RxReset' signal and synchronously reset when 'ByteCntEq16' is true with a propagation time defined by 'Tp'. The 'OpCodeOK' is also set when within the 'DetectionWindow', at two byte counts 'ByteCntEq14' and 'ByteCntEq15', if the lower byte of 'RxData' matches certain hexadecimal values (0x00, 0x01) under different conditions."
