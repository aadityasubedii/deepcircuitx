It is highly parameterized with parameters such as addressing width, data width, and command pattern to facilitate a wide range of memory configurations. It uses submodules like command generator (cmd_gen), memory controller block flow control (mcb_flow_control), and buffers (afifo) to handle read and write operations. Error checking is also implemented in the module. It uses a traffic generator status submodule (tg_status) to generate a status signal which shows if there was an error in the transmission, and what was the status of the checks. It also has data path modules for both read and write data paths. The data path modules include mechanisms to handle the actual write and read operations to memory, and generating the necessary control signals needed for these operations. The module also contains logic for checking whether commands are valid and managing memory addresses, bursts lengths and data."
