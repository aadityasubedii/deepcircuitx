This block of Verilog code is designed to ensure correct timing and reset logic for an unspecified hardware system. On the rising edge of `rst_n_in`, the block performs several checks. If `rst_n_in` is high, it issues a warning if less than 200 us have passed since system start when `check_strict_timing` is enabled. It also checks if `cke_in` is inactive when `rst_n_in` goes inactive and if `cke_in` has been inactive for 10 ns before `rst_n_in` goes inactive. Different behaviors are defined for `MAX_MEM` macro state. If `MAX_MEM` is not defined, it sets `memory_used` to 0. This helps to optimize system performance while retaining system stability.
