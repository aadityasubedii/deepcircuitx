    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a counter which gets incremented at the positive edge of the user interface clock signal. The counter will be reset to zero when \"int_sys_rst\" reset signal is active and it checks whether the most significant bit of the \"wait_200us_counter\" is one. The incrementation persists until the \"wait_200us_counter\" value reaches the maximum (when the MSB bit becomes \"1\"), after which the value of the counter stays at the maximum value without further incrementation."
