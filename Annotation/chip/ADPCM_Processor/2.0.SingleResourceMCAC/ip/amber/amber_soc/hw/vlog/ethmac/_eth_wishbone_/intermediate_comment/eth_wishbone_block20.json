    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is a synchronizer for the RxAbort signal. It uses a positive edge triggered flip-flop mechanism to propagate the RxAbort signal across two synchronous clock domains (MRxClk and Reset). The block initializes to '0' during a high Reset signal, and on every subsequent rising edge of MRxClk, it copies the previous state of RxAbort (RxAbortSyncb1) to the next stage (RxAbortSyncb2) with a propagation delay of 'Tp'."
