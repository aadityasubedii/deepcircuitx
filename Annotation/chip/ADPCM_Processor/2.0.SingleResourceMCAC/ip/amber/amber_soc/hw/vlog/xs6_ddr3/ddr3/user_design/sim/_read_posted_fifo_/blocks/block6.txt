The block of code manages a counter for read data received. Whenever there is a rising edge on the clk_i signal, the if-else statement is executed. The rst_i signal is used to reset the counter, rd_data_received_counts, setting its value to zero. On the other hand, when data_valid_i signal is high, the counter rd_data_received_counts is incremented by one, indicating the successful reception of a data item.
