    "block_comment": "The code block handles the calibration process of write operations in a memory cell. In particular, this piece of code sets the state of the system before initiating the write calibration where the reset signal is deactivated and the command signal is activated. The memory cell's address is set to 'DelayControl' and an arbitrary data '8'h20' is written to this memory cell. The write-read mode is set to 'WRITE_MODE' and the active driver resistance is set to 'RZQ'. The logic then checks if the controller is ready, and if it is, the system goes back into the 'WRITE_CALIBRATE' state, otherwise, it moves into the 'WAIT9' state."
