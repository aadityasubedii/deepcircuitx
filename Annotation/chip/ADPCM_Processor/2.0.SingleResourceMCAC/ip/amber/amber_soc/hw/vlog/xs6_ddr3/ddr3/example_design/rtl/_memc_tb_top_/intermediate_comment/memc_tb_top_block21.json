    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls a memory controller block (MCB). If the first entry of the `C_PORT_ENABLE` array (for port 0) is enabled (`1'b1`), then the two modules `init_mem_pattern_ctr` and `mcb_traffic_gen` are generated and perform their respective functions. `Init_mem_pattern_ctr` is initialized with parameters such as data width, family, address range, data mode, port mode and seeds for random data and command generation. This module interfaces with clock, reset, MCB command and write enable inputs, VIO mode and calibration status, and error, start-end address and mode signals as outputs. The `mcb_traffic_gen` serves as an interface between the MCB signals and the `init_mem_pattern_ctr`, controlling the operation modes of the MCB with various inputs and outputs. In case the port is not enabled, default values (zeros) are assigned to the error, error status, comparison data, comparison data validity, and comparison error signals."
