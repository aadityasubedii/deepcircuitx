    "block_comment": "This Verilog block handles the logic for reading data under different conditions, with synchronization via a DRP_CLK signal. At the positive edge of DRP_CLK, if sync_rst is true, it sets read_data to zero. If not, then it checks if the state equals ALMOST_READY3 and subsequently sets read_data to the value of shift_through_reg."
