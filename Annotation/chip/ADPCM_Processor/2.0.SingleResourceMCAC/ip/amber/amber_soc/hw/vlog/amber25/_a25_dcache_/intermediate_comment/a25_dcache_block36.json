    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for generating the `write_miss` signal. It determines whether the current condition constitutes a write miss event by logically combining various factors - namely, if a request is being held (`request_hold`), if write operation is enabled (`i_write_enable`), if there is no hit during idle mode (`!idle_hit`), and if no consecutive write operation is happening (`!consecutive_write`). When all these conditions are true, `write_miss` is asserted, indicating a write operation attempted on a non-touched part of the memory."
