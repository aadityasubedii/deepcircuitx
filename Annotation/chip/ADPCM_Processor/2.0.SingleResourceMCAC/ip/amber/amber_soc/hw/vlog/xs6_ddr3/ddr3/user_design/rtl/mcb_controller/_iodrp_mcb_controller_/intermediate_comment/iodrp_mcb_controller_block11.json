    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for mapping the value of the address 'drp_ioi_addr' to corresponding values of 'data_out_mux', depending on certain conditions enforced by an `ifdef` preprocessor directive. Specifically, it checks cases of 'drp_ioi_addr' and according to each case, assigns 'data_out_mux' a specific value derived from 'data_out'. If 'DRP_v1_0_FIX' is defined, certain cases result in a left-shift operation on 'data_out' before assigning to 'data_out_mux'. In case 'DRP_v1_0_FIX' is not defined or other cases are encountered, 'data_out' is directly assigned to 'data_out_mux'. In simpler terms, 'data_out_mux' gets manipulated 'data_out' based on the address and version of DRP."
