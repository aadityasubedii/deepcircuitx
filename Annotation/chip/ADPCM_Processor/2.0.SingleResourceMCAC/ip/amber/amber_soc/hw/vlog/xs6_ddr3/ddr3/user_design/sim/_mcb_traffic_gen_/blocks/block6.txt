Comment: 
The given Verilog RTL block is named `WR_ONLY_PATH` which functions as a code segment dedicated to disabling or resetting the `cmp_error`. It implements its function in a straightforward manner by assigning the binary value `1'b0` (equivalent to digital logic zero or false) to `cmp_error`. This piece of code is executed when none of the conditions before it in the conditional statement are met (indicated by the usage of the `else` keyword), thereby ensuring this error flag is reset in all other scenarios.
