    "block_comment": "This block of code governs the write-end flag generation in a data transmission process based on certain conditions. It gets triggered at the positive edge of the input clock. If the user_burst counter equals 2, if a command start condition is present with a burst length of 1 and if the hardware family is VIRTEX6, or if the FIFO is not full, then it sets the write_end flag high with a delay defined by TCQ. Otherwise, it sets the write_end flag low with the same delay."
