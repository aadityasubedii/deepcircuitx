Comment: 
This block of code manages the transmission interrupt signal (irq_txb) for a hardware block. On each positive clock edge or when a Reset is received, the block checks if a Reset signal is present, and if so, it clears the interrupt. If a transmission interrupt (TxB_IRQ) is high, the block sets the interrupt signal after a propagation delay (Tp). Similarly, it clears the interrupt signal, also after a propagation delay, if a write interrupt source (INT_SOURCE_Wr[0]) and a data input (DataIn[0]) are both high.
