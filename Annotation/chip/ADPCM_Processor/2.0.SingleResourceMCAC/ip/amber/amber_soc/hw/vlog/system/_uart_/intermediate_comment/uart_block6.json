    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code handles the read/write operations for the UART registers used in the Amba UART controller. The operations are triggered on the positive edge of a clock pulse. The block checks whether a read acknowledgement or write operation has been initiated. If the write operation is initiated, it displays the data to be written; if the read operation is initiated, it displays the data read from a specific address. This block handles known register input addresses and provides feedback on the type of UART register being accessed. It produces an error message when an input address does not fall within the recognized range. Additionally, for UART Tx/Rx char data read/write operation, it takes the lower 8 bits of the data. Finally, it also displays the address of the accessed register."
