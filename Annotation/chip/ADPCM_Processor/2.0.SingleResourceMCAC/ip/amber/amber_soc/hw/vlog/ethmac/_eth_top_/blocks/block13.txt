Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for maintaining the transmission state of a signal. It utilizes flip-flops, vital digital circuit components, to hold and update the 'WillTransmit' signal status. This operation is synchronous with the rising edge of 'mrx_clk_pad_i', signifying that this block is triggered on each positive clock edge. The delay element '#Tp' is employed to imitate the propagation delay associated with the flip-flops' operation, providing a realistic simulation of how the circuit would perform in an actual scenario.
