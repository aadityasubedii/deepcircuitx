Comment: 
The code block delivers a load pulse for a given mode based on the asynchronous input signals. It is triggered on the rising edge of the input clock signal, clk_i. It generates a pulse by performing a bitwise AND operation between delayed version mode_load_d1 and the negated delayed version of mode_load_d2, and assigns the result to the mode_load_pulse. The operation is delayed by time TCQ.
