    "block_comment": "This block manages memory address updates in synchronization with a clock signal. Upon receiving a start command, it initializes the 'acounts' register to a given input address. Also, when both the FIFO and data are ready, and a pre-defined burst length condition is met, it increments the 'acounts' register. The increment value is determined based on the number of data queue (DQ) pins, allowing for variable memory address stride."
