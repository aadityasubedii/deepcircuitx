    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to generate logic in certain conditions for specific data width and pattern. If the data width (DWIDTH) is equal to 128, and the data pattern (DATA_PATTERN) is either \"DGEN_HAMMER\" or \"DGEN_ALL\", then, and only then, it will trigger the always block on the positive edge of the input clock signal (clk_i). The always block will then be used to instantiate the desired hardware based on the intended data pattern and width. This implementation allows for the dynamic generation of hardware structures, making the design flexible and efficient specifically for situations where data width and pattern matches specified conditions."
