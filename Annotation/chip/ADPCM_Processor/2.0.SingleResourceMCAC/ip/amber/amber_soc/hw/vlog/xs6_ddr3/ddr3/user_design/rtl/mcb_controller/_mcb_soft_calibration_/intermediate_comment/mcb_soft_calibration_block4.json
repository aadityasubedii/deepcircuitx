    "block_comment": "This block carries out the function of a counter that is synchronized to the positive clock edge of UI_CLK, and is reset by RST_reg signal. The implementation begins by testing if the reset signal (RST_reg) is active. If it is, the 6-bit count is set to zero. Else, it checks the counter enable signal (counter_en). If enabled, the counter is incremented by one on each positive clock edge of UI_CLK. If not enabled, the 6-bit count gets reset to zero."
