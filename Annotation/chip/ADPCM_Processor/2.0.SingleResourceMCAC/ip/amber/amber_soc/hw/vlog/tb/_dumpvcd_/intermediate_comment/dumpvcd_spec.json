    "spec": "Module name: dumpvcd.\n\nModule specification: The dumpvcd module in Verilog RTL is designed for debugging and analysis purposes and does not have explicit input or output ports. The module's functionality revolves around the extraction and dumping of Value Change Dump (VCD) information when the AMBER_DUMP_VCD preprocessor directive is set. It primarily works based on the start and end cycle of the dumps set through the `AMBER_DUMP_START` and `AMBER_DUMP_LENGTH` signals, and the dump file set by the `AMBER_VCD_FILE`. \n\nThe module contains various internal signals associated with the system's functionality like `U_TB.clk_count` for tracking the clock cycles and several other signals related to the 'execute' block, fetch, cache, decode, wishbone bus, amber block, memory, and d-cache units. It also contains signals related to the registers of the 'execute' unit. The module initiates the control logic to dump VCD at every positive edge of the input clock `U_DECOMPILE.i_clk` to the 'decompile' unit. \n\nThe internal code includes a block to initiate VCD dump, then sequentially dumps all logical signals followed by turning the dump off. It also contains an always block to turn the dump on and off at different clock count conditions. This enables capturing system behavior over specific periods of execution. In case the `AMBER_A25_CORE` directive is defined, memory and d-cache dumping is controlled by the module. Also, if the `AMBER_TERMINATE` directive is set, the module displays an automatic test termination message after the dump cycle gets completed. This module is essential for deep system behavior analysis during runtime.",
