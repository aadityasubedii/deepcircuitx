    "block_comment": "This block of code is a conditionally generated increment counter for the VIRTEX6 FPGA family. Using the 'generate' and 'if' construct, instantiation occurs only if the FAMILY parameter is equal to \"VIRTEX6\". The module functionality is clock-driven as it activates with the positive edge of the input clock signal 'clk_i'."
