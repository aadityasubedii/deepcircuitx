The module is governed by the main system clock (MTxClk) and can be reset using the Reset input.\n\nThe module comprises of several input ports including StatePreamble, StateIPG, StateData, StatePAD, StateFCS, StateJam, StateBackOff, StateDefer, StateIdle, StartDefer, StartIPG, StartFCS, StartJam, StartBackoff, TxStartFrm, MinFL, MaxFL, HugEn, ExDfrEn, PacketFinished_q, and DlyCrcEn, each representing different states of Ethernet transmission, start points of each corresponding activity, frame lengths, contrl signals and statuses. \n\nThe output of the module is produced through ports including ByteCnt, NibCnt, ExcessiveDefer, NibCntEq7, NibCntEq15, MaxFrame, NibbleMinFl, and DlyCrcCnt, showing the results of byte and nibble counting, excessive defer status, comparisation results of the nibble count, maximum frame status and the delay of CRC respectively.\n\nThe internal signals such as IncrementNibCnt, ResetNibCnt, IncrementByteCnt, ResetByteCnt, ExcessiveDeferCnt, ByteCntMax, NibCntEq7, NibCntEq15, NibbleMinFl, and MaxFrame control various functionality within the module like increment/decrement/reset of byte or nibble counts, signal of excessive deferal, maximum byte count, setting various state conditions and others. \n\nThe module's design includes sections for byte and nibble counter increment and reset mechanism, deferral counting, setting conditions for different module states, and delay CRC mechanism. Each of these sections perform specific tasks to ensure the accurate counting and monitoring of Ethernet transmission protocols and situations.",

This module may also be used to check whether transmitted frames obey certain rules, such as Minimum/Maximum Frame Length (MinFL/MaxFL) and calculates the delay of CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). There are several states like IPG (Inter Packet Gap), Jam, BackOff, and Defer in which the counter increments the nibble count. The ByteCount incrementation occurs in certain conditions of these states. There are also certain conditions given under which these counters are reset. The excessive deferment situation is also being monitored by this module. The counters are synchronously reset and updated with the rising edge of the clock (MTxClk) or if Reset is high."

The module is governed by the main system clock (MTxClk) and can be reset using the Reset input.\n\nThe module comprises of several input ports including StatePreamble, StateIPG, StateData, StatePAD, StateFCS, StateJam, StateBackOff, StateDefer, StateIdle, StartDefer, StartIPG, StartFCS, StartJam, StartBackoff, TxStartFrm, MinFL, MaxFL, HugEn, ExDfrEn, PacketFinished_q, and DlyCrcEn, each representing different states of Ethernet transmission, start points of each corresponding activity, frame lengths, contrl signals and statuses. \n\nThe output of the module is produced through ports including ByteCnt, NibCnt, ExcessiveDefer, NibCntEq7, NibCntEq15, MaxFrame, NibbleMinFl, and DlyCrcCnt, showing the results of byte and nibble counting, excessive defer status, comparisation results of the nibble count, maximum frame status and the delay of CRC respectively.\n\nThe internal signals such as IncrementNibCnt, ResetNibCnt, IncrementByteCnt, ResetByteCnt, ExcessiveDeferCnt, ByteCntMax, NibCntEq7, NibCntEq15, NibbleMinFl, and MaxFrame control various functionality within the module like increment/decrement/reset of byte or nibble counts, signal of excessive deferal, maximum byte count, setting various state conditions and others. \n\nThe module's design includes sections for byte and nibble counter increment and reset mechanism, deferral counting, setting conditions for different module states, and delay CRC mechanism. Each of these sections perform specific tasks to ensure the accurate counting and monitoring of Ethernet transmission protocols and situations."
