    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a flip-flop synchronizer for the TxRetry signal with a reset functionality. Upon the rising edge of the input clock 'WB_CLK_I', or when the Reset signal is asserted, the code begins execution. If the Reset is active, the output 'TxRetry_wb' is set to LOW, effectively performing a reset operation. However, if Reset is not active, 'TxRetry_wb' captures the value of 'TxRetrySync1', thereby synchronizing the 'TxRetry' signal to the system clock 'WB_CLK_I'."
