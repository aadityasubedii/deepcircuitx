Comment: 
This block manages the counts of read data requests. The count is reset when a reset signal, 'rst_i[0]', is detected during the positive clock edge. If a valid instruction signal, 'instr_vld_dly1', is detected and 'pipe_data_in[32]' is high, the count gets updated based on 'pipe_data_in[40:35]'; if it is zero, the count is incremented by 64, otherwise it is incremented by the value of 'pipe_data_in[40:35]' itself.
