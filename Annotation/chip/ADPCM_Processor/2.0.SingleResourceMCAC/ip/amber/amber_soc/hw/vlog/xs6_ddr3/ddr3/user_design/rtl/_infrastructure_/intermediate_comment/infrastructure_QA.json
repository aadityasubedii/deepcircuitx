It utilizes several FPGA primitives such as IBUFGDS, IBUFG for input clock signal conditioning, PLL_ADV for clock multiplication and division with the flexibility of setting different parameters, BUFG and BUFGCE for buffered clock output, BUFPLL_MCB for generating necessary internal clocks. \n\nThe differential and single-ended clock input options are enabled based on parameters providing versatility. Besides, asynchronous reset and synchronous reset functionality is also included. The reset signals are synchronized to avoid metastability. \n\nMoreover, the module handles the PLL lock signal to ascertain the status of the internal clock generation. When the PLL fails to lock, a reset signal is generated (asynchronous reset) to ensure the system state does not fall into an undefined behavior."
