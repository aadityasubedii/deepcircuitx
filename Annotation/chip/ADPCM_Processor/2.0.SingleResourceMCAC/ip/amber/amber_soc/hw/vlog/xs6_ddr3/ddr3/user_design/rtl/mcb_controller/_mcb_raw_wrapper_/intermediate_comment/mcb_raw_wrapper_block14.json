    "block_comment": "The function of this Verilog block is to generate and configure differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK) modulators and IO Delay Reduction Phase 2 (IODRP2) Memory Controller Blocks (MCBs) depending on the number of DQ pins configured. For each DQ pin, a Master-Slave implementation pair of IODRP2 MCBs is implemented, where each master MCB receives input data, processes it according to the defined parameters and passes the output to the corresponding slave MCB. The output of each slave MCB is connected to the respective DQ pin. Moreover, there are additional MCBs specifically for handling delay signals (DQS) and the memory update logic. The block uses wires to handle auxiliary side-channel data transfer between MCBs. The configuration parameters of each MCB such as data rate, delay value, MCB address, SERDES mode and simulated tap delay value are defined within each MCB instantiation."
