    "block_comment": "This block of code is a compiler directive in Verilog RTL code that allows for conditional compilation. Specifically, this construct `ifdef AMBER_LOAD_MAIN_MEM is used for checking if the compilation variable AMBER_LOAD_MAIN_MEM is defined. If AMBER_LOAD_MAIN_MEM is defined, then the code sequence immediately following this directive will be included in the compilation, otherwise, it will be ignored. This is primarily used to manage different build configurations, for example, where certain blocks of code are only relevant under specific conditions or configurations."
