The block assigns a simulation control register with a predefined constant value in a synchronous manner. More specifically, the block of code is executed on the positive edge of the input clock signal, i_clk, at which it updates the 'sim_ctrl_reg' signal with the predefined value represented by `AMBER_SIM_CTRL. The value assigned is a 3-bit value, which might relate to a state or mode of operation. This synchronous update ensures the register value changes in tandem with the 
system clock.
