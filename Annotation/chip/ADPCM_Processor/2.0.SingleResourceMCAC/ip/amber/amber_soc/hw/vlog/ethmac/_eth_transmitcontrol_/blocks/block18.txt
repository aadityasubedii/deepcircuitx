This block of Verilog RTL code manages the control for sending control frames in a communication system. It gets triggered at the positive edges of MTxClk or TxReset signals. At each triggering event, first, it checks if there is a reset (TxReset), if true, it disables the control frame sending function by setting 'WillSendControlFrame' to 0 with a delay of #Tp. If the condition is false, it checks if a control frame transmission has just finished and control mux is selected (TxCtrlEndFrm & CtrlMux), if so, again it sets 'WillSendControlFrame' to 0, disabling the sending of control frames. If both these conditions are false, it checks if a pause request is active and transmission flow is not paused (TPauseRq & TxFlow), if this is true, it enables the sending of control frames by setting 'WillSendControlFrame' to 1 with delay #Tp.
