It also handles cache related functionality, deciding whether an instruction is cacheable or not, and if cacheable, whether to fetch it from cache or from main memory. It outputs the fetched instruction as well as statuses like fetch stall, write back request etc. \n\nIt also interfaces with another module named 'a25_icache' to interact with a built-in instruction cache. The fetch operation is synced with the clock signal and stalls if the system is not ready, cache is stalling or wait state for write-back stage."
