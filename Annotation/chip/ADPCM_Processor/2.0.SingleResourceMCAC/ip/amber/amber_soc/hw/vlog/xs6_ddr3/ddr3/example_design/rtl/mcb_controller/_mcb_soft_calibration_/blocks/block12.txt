This block of Verilog code handles state transitions for dynamic calibration. In the case where a certain condition is not met, it sets the state to start dynamic calibration (`START_DYN_CAL`). If the condition is met, it assigns `DYN_CAL_PASS` to `LastPass_DynCal` and transitions the state to writing the calibration (`WRITE_CALIBRATE`).
