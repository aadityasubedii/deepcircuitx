    "block_comment": "The given Verilog codeblock handles read operations in a synchronous digital system. Upon each positive edge of the system clock i_clk, it checks if the system is not currently writing (o_write is LOW) and is valid for performing operations (o_valid is HIGH), it sets the busy_reading_r flag indicating that the system is busy reading data. However, if the input data i_rdata_valid is valid, the flag is cleared, indicating that the system is no longer reading data. This codeblock effectively provides flow control for data read operations in a system."
