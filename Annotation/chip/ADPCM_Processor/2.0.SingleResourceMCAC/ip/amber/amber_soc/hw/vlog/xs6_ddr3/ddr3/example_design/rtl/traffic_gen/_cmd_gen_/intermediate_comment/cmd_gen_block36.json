    "block_comment": "This hardware block is a synchronous address generator, working with a clock input signal. It employs a reset signal to set the start address, and in the absence of reset, uses a three-bit address mode register to select different address schemes. Possible address mode options are binary representations to direct address output from bram_address (user-defined address), fix_address (static address), PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) generated address, sequential address with certain bits formatted differently. The default case leads to a zeroing of the address output."
