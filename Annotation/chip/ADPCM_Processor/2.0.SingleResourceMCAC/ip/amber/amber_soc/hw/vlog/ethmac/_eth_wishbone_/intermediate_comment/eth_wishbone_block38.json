    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for tracking and latching the start of received data frames in a synchronous system. At each rising edge of the MRxClk clock signal or hard reset, the block checks for various conditions and then updates the LatchedRxStartFrm register accordingly. If 'Reset' is high, the register is cleared indicating no ongoing data frame reception. Conversely, if 'RxStartFrm' signal becomes high and 'SyncRxStartFrm_q' is low, this implies a new data frame has started and consequently, 'LatchedRxStartFrm' is set high. If the synced start frame signal 'SyncRxStartFrm_q' is high, then no new data frames are being received and 'LatchedRxStartFrm' is cleared."
