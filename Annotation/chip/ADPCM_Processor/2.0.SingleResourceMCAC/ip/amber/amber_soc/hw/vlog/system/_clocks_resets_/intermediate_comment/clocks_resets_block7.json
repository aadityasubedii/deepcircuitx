    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for creating a synchronous reset mechanism. It uses a shift register concept to synchronize the reset signal to the system clock for reducing issues caused by asynchronous resets like gltiches and timing problems. When the reset signal 'rst_tmp' is high or a rising edge appears in 'o_sys_clk,' the 'rst0_sync_r' register gets filled with ones, creating the initial state of the shift register. Else, it shifts the register's value to the left, effectively debouncing the reset signal."
