This block of code initiates a waiting period in the simulation. Specifically, the `wait_200us_counter` is assigned a maximum 16-bit hexadecimal value, which suggests a delay or wait functionality, potentially connected with a counter that decrements over time or cycles. The `$display` function is used to print a message noting that a 200-microsecond wait time, typically required before the Clock Enable (CKE) signal is active, has been skipped for the purpose of the simulation.
