    "block_comment": "This block assigns a subset of the input `i_wb_adr` value to the `address` wire/reg. Specifically, it extracts a range of bits, from `MADDR_WIDTH+3` down to 4, from the `i_wb_adr` input and assigns it to `address`. The extraction of specific bit ranges allows for manipulation of specific portions of the input data, enabling precise control over certain functionality or features in the hardware design."
