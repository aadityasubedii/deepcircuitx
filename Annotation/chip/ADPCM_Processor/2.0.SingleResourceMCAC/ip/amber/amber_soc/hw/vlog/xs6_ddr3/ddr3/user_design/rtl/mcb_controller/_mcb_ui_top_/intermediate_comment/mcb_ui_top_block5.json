    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily serves as a signal router when the AXI interface is disabled. Each input signal directly assigns to its corresponding internal signal without any additional logic processing, ensuring that the behavior inside this block remains consistent regardless of the external AXI interface availability. Furthermore, status signals from the command write, read and command buffers, such as empty or full flags, error flags, and byte counts, are also routed back from internal to output signals. This maintains a consistent interface for external modules to monitor relevant status and effectively manage data flow controls."
