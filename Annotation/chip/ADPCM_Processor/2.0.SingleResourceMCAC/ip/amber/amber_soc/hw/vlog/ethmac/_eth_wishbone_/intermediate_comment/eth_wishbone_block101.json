    "block_comment": "The code block assigns a concatenated multi-part value to the signal `TxBDDataIn`. The assigned value consists of the `LatchedTxLength`, a static binary value `1'b0`, the `TxStatus`, a 2-bit binary value `2'h0`, and the `TxStatusInLatched`. It serves as a method for gathering crucial status and control values into one cohesive, multi-bit signal which can then be manipulated, examined or transmitted as a whole."
