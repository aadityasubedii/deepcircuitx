    "block_comment": "This block handles data transfers within the system under specific conditions. During each positive edge of the clock cycle, it checks whether the read buffer is not empty and a read operation is active. If both conditions are satisfied, the input read data (`i_rd_data`) is transferred to the output write-back data (`o_wb_dat`)."
