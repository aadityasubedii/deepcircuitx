    "block_comment": "This block handles the generation and clearing of the `irq_txe` interrupt flag. The operation is triggered by either the rising edge of the `Clk` signal or the rising edge of the `Reset` signal. Specifically, if `Reset` is high, `irq_txe` is cleared. Also, if there is a transmit empty interrupt (`TxE_IRQ`), the `irq_txe` interrupt flag is set after a propagation delay `Tp`. Furthermore, if the first bit of the `INT_SOURCE_Wr` signal and the second bit of the `DataIn` signal are both high, the `irq_txe` interrupt flag is cleared after the same `Tp` delay."
