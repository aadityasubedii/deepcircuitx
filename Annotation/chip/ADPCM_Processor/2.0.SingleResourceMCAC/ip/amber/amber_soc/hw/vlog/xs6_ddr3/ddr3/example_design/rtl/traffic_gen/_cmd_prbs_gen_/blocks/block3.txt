Comment: 
This block stands as a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) generator. Within, a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is implemented, given a seed (prbs_seed_i) on initiation (prbs_seed_init). Thereafter, when clk_en is high at a positive edge of clk_i (clock input), the LFSR performs shift operations - a mix of straight shift down actions and a feedback loop involving XOR function at 20th and 17th bit to create the pseudo-random sequence. The delay characteristic (#TCQ) reflects a timing control for the operations.
