Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for resetting a system based on either a user-defined clock (UI_CLK) or a reset condition (RST). If the signal for RST is high, Block_Reset is returned to a low state and a counter, RstCounter, is reset to zero. If RST is not high then the system checks for a 'Pre_SYSRST' condition: if this is present, the RstCounter is set to a value of RST_CNT. If the counter has not yet reached a predetermined maximum value (TZQINIT_MAXCNT), Block_Reset is activated and RstCounter increases by one.
