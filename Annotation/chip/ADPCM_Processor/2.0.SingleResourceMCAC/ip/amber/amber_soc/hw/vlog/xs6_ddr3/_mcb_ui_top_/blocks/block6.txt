This block defines an axi_mcb module which serves as an interface between the AXI4 interface and MCB (Memory Controller Block) in Spartan-6 FPGAs. The module handles read and write transactions from the AXI interface to/from the MCB. Transfer parameters (like addr width, data width, id width, etc.) and supports for different operations like read, write, and narrow burst are parameterized to make the module more flexible. The module takes a variety of AXI signals (like aclk, aresetn, awid, awaddr, etc.) which are associated with different features of the AXI protocol like address channel, write data channel, read/write data channel, etc., and MCB signals (like cmd_clk, cmd_en, wr_data, rd_data, etc.) that handle the command, write and read operations on the MCB.
