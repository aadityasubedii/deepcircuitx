Comment: 
This block of code defines a condition under which the byte count is incremented by two. The incrementation is control signal driven; it transpires when 'CtrlMux' and 'TxCtrlStartFrm' signals are active and 'TxCtrlStartFrm_q' signal is inactive along with the presence of used data input 'TxUsedDataIn'. It uses an assign statement to directly assign the result of this four-condition logical combination to 'IncrementByteCntBy2'.
