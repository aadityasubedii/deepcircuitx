    "block_comment": "The block of code is used for the conditional activation of the data clock based on certain conditions. The data clock (`data_clk_en`) is enabled if and only if the FIFO (First In First Out) buffer (`fifo_rdy_i`) is ready, data (`data_rdy_i`) is ready, and the user burst count (`user_burst_cnt`) is greater than 1; if those conditions meet, then it sets `data_clk_en` to true. This design is controlled by a conditional (if) clause available within the `generate-endgenerate` construct, providing conditional compilation depending on the `EYE_TEST` condition."
