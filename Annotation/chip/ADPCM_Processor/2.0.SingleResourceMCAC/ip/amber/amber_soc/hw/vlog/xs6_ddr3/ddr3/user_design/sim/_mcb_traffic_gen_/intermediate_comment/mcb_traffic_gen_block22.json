    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for checking and managing data transfer during simulation. It creates a conditional code generation structure that only applies if the simulation flag is set to \"TRUE\". Within this if-statement, it declares a register for tracking fifo errors, then defines 32-bit wire for a data transfer address and a wire for reading from the command fifo. It assigns the fifo write operation condition as the logical AND of flow to command ready and command to flow valid signals \u2013 this indicates that data transfer only happens when the flow is ready to command and the command is validated."
