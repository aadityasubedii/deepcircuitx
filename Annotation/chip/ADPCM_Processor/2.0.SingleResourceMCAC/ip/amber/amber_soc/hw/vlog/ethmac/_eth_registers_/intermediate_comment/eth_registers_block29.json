    "block_comment": "This block assigns specific subsets of the `MIIADDRESSOut` variable to `r_RGAD` and `r_FIAD`. The bits from 12 to 8 of the `MIIADDRESSOut` are mapped to `r_RGAD` while the last five bits (from 4 to 0) of the `MIIADDRESSOut` are mapped to `r_FIAD`. This design adopts a simple mapping strategy to assign particular bit segments from a source to the target registers, aiding in efficient data operations and storage."
