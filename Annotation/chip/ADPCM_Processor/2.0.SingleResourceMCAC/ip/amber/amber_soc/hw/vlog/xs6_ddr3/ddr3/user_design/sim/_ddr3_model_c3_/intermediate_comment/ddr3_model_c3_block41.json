    "block_comment": "This block of code calls the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function for check/register tasks every time there's a falling edge of the signal `dqs_in[24]`. The implementation continuously monitors the signal `dqs_in` at the 24th bit position, triggering the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function when a negative transition (from 1 to 0) is detected."
