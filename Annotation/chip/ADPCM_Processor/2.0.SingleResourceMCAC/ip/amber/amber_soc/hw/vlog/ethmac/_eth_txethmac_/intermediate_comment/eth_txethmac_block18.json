    "block_comment": "This block of code monitors changes in transmission and maintains the status of a control latch. When the macrocell Transmit Clock (`MTxClk`) experiences a positive edge or a reset signal is detected, the block activates. In the event of a reset, it sets `StatusLatch` to 0 after a propagation delay defined by `Tp`. Otherwise, the block checks if a transmission start frame is not occurring, in which case it again sets `StatusLatch` to 0. However, if an excessive defer event has occurred or if the system is in an idle state, `StatusLatch` will be set to 1 after `Tp` delay."
