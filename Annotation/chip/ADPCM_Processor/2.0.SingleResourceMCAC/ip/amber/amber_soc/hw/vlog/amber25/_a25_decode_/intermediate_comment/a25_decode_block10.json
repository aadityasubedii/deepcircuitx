    "block_comment": "The block of code determines the validity of the given instruction based on the current control state of the system. The instruction is considered valid if the current control state is either EXECUTE or PRE_FETCH_EXEC or if the instruction is not in the process of being executed and the control state is either in PC_STALL1, MEM_WAIT1, COPRO_WAIT, SWAP_WRITE, MULT_PROC1, or MTRANS_EXEC1. This implementation is accomplished using logical OR and AND operators in a conditional statement to check for the defined states, assigning the result to the 'instruction_valid' signal."
