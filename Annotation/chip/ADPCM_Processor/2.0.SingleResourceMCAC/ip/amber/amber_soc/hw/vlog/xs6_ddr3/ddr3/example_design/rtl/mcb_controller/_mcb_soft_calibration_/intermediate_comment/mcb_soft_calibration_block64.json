    "block_comment": "The block of code essentially functions as a timer to handle refresh operations under certain conditions in a memory controller design. At every positive edge of the UI Clock, it checks a series of conditions and sets the respective values for the WaitTimer and WarmEnough signals. If a reset signal is enabled or self-refresh request occurs, it sets the WaitTimer to zero and WarmEnough to high or low appropriately. Otherwise, it checks if the WaitTimer has reached a certain value or if the WaitCountEnable is high, then increments the WaitTimer. This mechanism ensures a controlled time delay for self-refresh requests."
