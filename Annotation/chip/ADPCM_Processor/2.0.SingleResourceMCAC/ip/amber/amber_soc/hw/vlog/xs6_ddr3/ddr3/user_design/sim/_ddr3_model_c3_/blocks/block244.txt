The block is used to simulate a delay in the chip select signal path (`cs_n`). The delay is defined by the parameter `BUS_DELAY`. This is achieved using a non-blocking assignment (`<=`) within an always block. The always block is sensitive to changes in the `cs_n` signal. This signifies that whenever the `cs_n` changes its value, after the duration defined by `BUS_DELAY`, this new value is assigned to `cs_n_in`.
