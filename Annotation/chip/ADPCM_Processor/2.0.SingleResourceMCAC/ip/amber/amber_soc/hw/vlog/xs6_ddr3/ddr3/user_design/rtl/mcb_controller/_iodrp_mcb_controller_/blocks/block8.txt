Comment: 
This block is a counter logic for a Design Reference Process (DRP) in Verilog. At every rising edge of DRP_CLK, if the current state falls into either ADDR_PHASE or DATA_PHASE and there isn't a synchronous reset, the three-bit wide counter 'bit_cnt' increments by one, otherwise, it resets to zero. This block keeps track of the number of clock cycles passed in the defined states and hence, can be helpful in controlling the flow of the process based on the count value.
