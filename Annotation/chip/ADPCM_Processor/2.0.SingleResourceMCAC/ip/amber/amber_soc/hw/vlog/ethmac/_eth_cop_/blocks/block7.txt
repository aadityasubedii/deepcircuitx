Comment: 
The block implements a control signal multiplexer for two slave interfaces (S1 and S2). It responds to changes in various input signals and manages the `m2_wb_ack_o` and `m2_wb_dat_o` outputs depending on whether a specific interface is being addressed. When `m2_in_progress` is high, it checks if `M2_ADDRESSED_S1` is true to select data and acknowledgement signals from S1; otherwise, it chooses signals from S2. If no operation is in progress, `m2_wb_ack_o` is reset to 0.
