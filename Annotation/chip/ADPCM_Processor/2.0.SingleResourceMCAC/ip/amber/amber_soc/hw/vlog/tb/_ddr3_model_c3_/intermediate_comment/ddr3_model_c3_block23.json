    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes a negative edge-triggered timing check on digital quasi-strobe signal at index 9. Implementation is achieved through instantiation of 'dqs_neg_timing_check' procedure whenever a falling edge on 'dqs_in[9]' signal occurs, thus allowing for a timely check of strobe signal transitions."
