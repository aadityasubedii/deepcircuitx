    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a synchronous counter with reset and preset functionality. At each rising edge of `Clk` or `Reset`, the counter behavior is defined. If a reset signal is detected, the counter is reset to 1. If reset is not asserted, two scenarios could occur: If `CountEq0` is true, the counter is loaded with a preset value, otherwise, the counter is decremented by 1. This design enables precise timing control over the counter value, making it suitable for various counting and timing tasks."
