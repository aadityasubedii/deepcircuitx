    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block defines conditions for specific memory types (DDR, MDDR, and DDR2) to apply different pull-down/up hardware operations. If the memory is of type DDR, MDDR, or DDR2 with a specific condition (C_MEM_DDR2_DIFF_DQS_EN set to \"NO\"), only pull-down on signal 'mcbx_dram_dqs' is executed. Otherwise, in addition to the pull-down on 'mcbx_dram_dqs', pull-up operation is also performed on signal 'mcbx_dram_dqs_n'. This block handles voltage level adjustments for memory-specific operations."
