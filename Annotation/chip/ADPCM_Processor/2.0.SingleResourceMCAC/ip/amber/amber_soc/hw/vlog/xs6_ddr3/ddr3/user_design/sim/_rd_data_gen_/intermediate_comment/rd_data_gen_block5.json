    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a part of a synchronous system that handles the readiness of commands based on different conditions. Triggered at the rising edge of the input clock, the command readiness (`cmd_rdy`) flag is set or reset based on certain input conditions. If the system reset (`rst_i[0]`) is active, the command readiness flag is set to 1 after the clock-queue delay (`#TCQ`). If a command start (`cmd_start`) is detected, then the readiness flag is set to 0 after the same delay. Additionally, the code checks for the readiness of the data port FIFO and the completion of the user burst (when `user_burst_cnt` equals 1). If both conditions are met, it sets the `cmd_rdy` flag to 1 after the same delay."
