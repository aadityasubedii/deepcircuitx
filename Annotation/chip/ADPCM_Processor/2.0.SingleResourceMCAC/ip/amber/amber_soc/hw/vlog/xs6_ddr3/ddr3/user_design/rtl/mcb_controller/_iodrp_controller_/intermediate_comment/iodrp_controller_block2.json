    "block_comment": "The block functions as a state machine controller for a sequential process such as read/write access to a memory or register. It transitions through various states including READY, DECIDE, ADDR_PHASE, DATA_PHASE, and others based on specific conditions. The choice of the next state depends on several variables including 'cmd_valid', 'bit_cnt' and 'rd_not_write_reg'. Actions such as loading shift and address data selection are performed in certain states. For example, in the DECIDE state, both 'load_shift_n' and 'addr_data_sel_n' are set to 1. The state machine returns to the READY state after completing a cycle of operations, and also defaults to the READY state for any unspecified condition."
