    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the writing of received data to a FIFO buffer. It responds to a rising edge of the MRxClk clock signal or a Reset signal. If a Reset signal is detected, it sets WriteRxDataToFifo to 0. If the SetWriteRxDataToFifo signal is high and the RxAbort signal is low, it sets the WriteRxDataToFifo bit to 1, indicating that received data should be written to the FIFO. If either the WriteRxDataToFifoSync2 signal is high or the RxAbort signal is high, it sets the WriteRxDataToFifo bit back to 0, halting writing of received data to the FIFO. It employs non-blocking assignments to achieve correct sequential logic."
