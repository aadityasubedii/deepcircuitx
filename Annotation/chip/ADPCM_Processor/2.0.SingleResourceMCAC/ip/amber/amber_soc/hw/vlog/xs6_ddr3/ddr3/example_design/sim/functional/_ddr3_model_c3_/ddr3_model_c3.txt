Module-level comment: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, implementing timing checks, command processing, and data operations. It handles initialization, command decoding, read/write operations, and refresh cycles. The module uses state machines and pipelines to manage different operational modes, enforces timing constraints, and simulates data storage and retrieval. It also includes features like write leveling, ODT control, and power-down modes, accurately modeling the behavior of a DDR3 SDRAM chip.
