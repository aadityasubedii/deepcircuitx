    "block_comment": "This block is primarily involved in the synchronization of the 'valid_bits_r' register with the system's clock. Specifically, upon every positive edge detected in the clock signal 'i_clk', the block checks whether the current state 'c_state' is set to 'CS_IDLE'. If true, it then reassigns the value of the 'valid_bits_r' register to the most significant bits of the 'tag_rdata_way' registers from index 0 to 7. This logic effectively takes the most significant bit from each of the eight 'tag_rdata_way' registers and collects them together to form a new byte when the system is in the 'CS_IDLE' state."
