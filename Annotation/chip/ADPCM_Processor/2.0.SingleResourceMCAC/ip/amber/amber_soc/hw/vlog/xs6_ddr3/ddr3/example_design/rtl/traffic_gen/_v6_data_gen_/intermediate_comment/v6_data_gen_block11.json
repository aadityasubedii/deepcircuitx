    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code handles data manipulation for a memory burst length of eight. The implementation is designed to split the I/O pins into four segments and for each segment, a new value is calculated by concatenating a 4-bit slice from the prior 8-bit value with a 1-bit shift, using a delay defined by TCQ. This method effectively shifts the data 4 bits during each execution cycle."
