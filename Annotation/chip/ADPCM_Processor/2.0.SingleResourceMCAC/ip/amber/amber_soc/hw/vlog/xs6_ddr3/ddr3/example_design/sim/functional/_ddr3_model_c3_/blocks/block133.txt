Comment: 
The provided block of code is a procedural assignment that calls a sub-routine called 'dm_timing_check' whenever there is a change in the 14th bit of the input data bus 'dm_in'. The function of this block is to execute a check operation on the digital timing of the 14th bit signal of 'dm_in'. It achieves this by invoking the 'dm_timing_check' function which presumably contains the logic to perform the timing check whenever there's an event (change in value) for 'dm_in[14]'.
