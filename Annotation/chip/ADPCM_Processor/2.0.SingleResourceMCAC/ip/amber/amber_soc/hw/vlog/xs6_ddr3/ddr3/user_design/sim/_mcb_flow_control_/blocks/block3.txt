Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls a write-in-progress signal responding to a rising edge clock input. If the reset signal or the last-word-write signal is activated, the write process is stopped by assigning '0' to the write-in-progress signal after a delay defined by TCQ. Alternatively, if the current state is set to WRITE, it indicates that a write process has begun and '1' is assigned to the write-in-progress signal after the same delay.
