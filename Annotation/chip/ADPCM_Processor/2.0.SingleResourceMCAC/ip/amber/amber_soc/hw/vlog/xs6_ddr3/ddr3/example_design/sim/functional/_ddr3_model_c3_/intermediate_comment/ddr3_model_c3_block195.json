    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a triggered event on a positive edge detection for the 14th bit in the 'dqs_even' array. Whenever a positive edge (transition from '0' to '1') is detected in the 14th bit of 'dqs_even', the function 'dqs_even_receiver' is invoked with an argument of '13'. All of these operations happen synchronously owing to the presence of the 'always' keyword."
