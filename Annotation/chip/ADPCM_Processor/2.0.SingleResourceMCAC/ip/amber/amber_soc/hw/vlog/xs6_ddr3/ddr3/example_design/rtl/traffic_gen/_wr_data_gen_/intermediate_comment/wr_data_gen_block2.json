    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code generates data for SPARTAN6 family of devices, under the label SP6_WDGEN. It uses the module sp6_data_gen, where input outputs are defined. This module accepts several inputs like clock signal, reset signal, data ready signal, seed for PRBS, address, etc., and outputs generated data. The data generation and handling is influenced by parameters like TCQ, address width etc. Additionally, the mode of data generation and command starts also dictate the data generation. The module also checks for fifo not being full before generating more data. The generated data is then passed on as output."
