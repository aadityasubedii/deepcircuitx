    "block_comment": "This block is a timing check specifically for the rising edge of the dqs_in[8] signal. It calls the function dqs_pos_timing_check(8) whenever there is a positive edge in dqs_in[8]. This 'always' block monitors the value of dqs_in[8] and responds to any change in state, executing the mentioned function each time a positive edge appears."
