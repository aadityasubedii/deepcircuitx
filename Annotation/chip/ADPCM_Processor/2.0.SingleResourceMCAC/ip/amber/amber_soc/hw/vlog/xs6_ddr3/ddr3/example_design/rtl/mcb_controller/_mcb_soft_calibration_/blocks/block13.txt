The block of code primarily manages the termination resistance control process of a memory interface in a ready or non-busy state, and when dynamic calibration is complete. It operates based on the absence of a self-refresh request. When dynamic input termination is not to be skipped and the previous dynamic calibration process was successful, the system updates the termination state to indicate successful input termination and sets the next state to load normal terminal resistance.
