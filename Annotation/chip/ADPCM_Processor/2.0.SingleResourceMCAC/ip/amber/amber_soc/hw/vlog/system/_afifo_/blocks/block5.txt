The block keeps track of the read position within a buffer or memory array. When there's a positive edge on read clock (rd_clk) and the pop signal (i_pop) is high and the queue isn't empty (o_empty is low), the read pointer is incremented, effectively moving to the next memory position, and thus preparing it for a potential read operation in the next cycle.
