    "block_comment": "This block of code monitors data stored in 37th index of the dq_in array. Whenever there's a change observed in the dq_in[37], the subroutine dq_timing_check is invoked with 37 passed as an argument. Despite the simplicity of its operation, this block plays an important role in maintaining the accuracy and timing of data flowing through the system."
