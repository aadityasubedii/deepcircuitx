    "block_comment": "This block of code handles collision detection for a two-line Verilog transmission system. On each rising edge of the clock signal or system reset signal, the block checks if a reset has occurred and, if so, clears the collision flags for both lines. If a reset has not occurred, the block checks if a collision has been detected on line one, and if a reset collision request has not been received, sets a collision flag for line two. This effectively propagates any observed collisions from line one to line two on subsequent clock cycles unless a collision reset request has been received."
