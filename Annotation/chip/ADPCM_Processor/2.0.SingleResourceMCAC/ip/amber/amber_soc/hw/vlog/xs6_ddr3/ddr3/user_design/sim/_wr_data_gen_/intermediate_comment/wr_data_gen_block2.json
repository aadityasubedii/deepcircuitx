    "block_comment": "The block is a conditional hardware generator for the 'SPARTAN6' family, implementing a SP6 data generator module with specified parameters. The module creates a functional model of data generation for the SPARTAN6 device by receiving control signals (like clock, reset, etc.) and outputting respective data. It generates data based on input mode and starts commands (cmd_startA to cmd_startE). It also has a mode to receive PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) seed value and fixed data for different operation modes. The addr_i input indicates the address where the data is read/write, and the user_burst_cnt controls the burst length. Output data_o is returned from this block when the fifo is not full."
