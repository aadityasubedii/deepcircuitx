    "block_comment": "This block handles logic related to the push command of a data buffer or stack. On the rising edge of the clock input (clk_i), the signal for the push command (push_cmd) is propagated through the system with a delay defined by TCQ, and assigned to the register signal (push_cmd_r). This allows the system to prepare for a subsequent push operation by letting it know in advance."
