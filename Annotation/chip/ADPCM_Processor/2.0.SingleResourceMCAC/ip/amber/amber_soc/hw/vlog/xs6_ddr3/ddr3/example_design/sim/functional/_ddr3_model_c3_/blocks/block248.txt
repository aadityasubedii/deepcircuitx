This block of code is responsible for file handling, specifically opening multiple bank files. The block checks if a specific path ("model_data") is specified in the command line arguments, and if not, it uses a default path ("/tmp"). It displays a warning message when the default path is used. Subsequently, it iteratively opens all the bank files, where the number of bank files is defined by the `BANKS constant. In this iteration, open_bank_file function is called for each bank file.
