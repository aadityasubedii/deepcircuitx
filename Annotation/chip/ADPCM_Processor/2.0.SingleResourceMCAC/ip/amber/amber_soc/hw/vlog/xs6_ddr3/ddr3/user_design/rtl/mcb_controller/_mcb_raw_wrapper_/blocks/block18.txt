Comment: 
This block of Verilog code instantiates a master serializer/deserializer (OSERDES2) named `ioi_ldm_0` used for high-speed data transmission. The OSERDES2 block operates with a bypass for the global clock flip flop, a specified data rate, as well as in a master SERDES mode. The output mode is set to the single-ended mode, with data width set to 2. The serial data is generated from `dqplm` & `dqnlm`, and `ldm_oq` & `ldm_t` are its output ends. The clocking is provided by `ioclk90` while `pll_ce_90` carries the clock enable signal. The rest of the connections have either constant '0' or '1'. Writing is enabled on `T1` & `T2 `via the signal `dqIO_w_en_0`. All shift inputs are zero and the module resets at `int_sys_rst`.
