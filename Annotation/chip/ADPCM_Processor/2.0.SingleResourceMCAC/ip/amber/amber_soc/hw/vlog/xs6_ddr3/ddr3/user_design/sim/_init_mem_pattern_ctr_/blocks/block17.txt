Comment: 
This block sets the end boundary address for data storage or processing once per clock cycle on a rising clock edge. It achieves this by subtracting the ratio of data width to 8 from the 32-bit END_ADDRESS and adding 1 to the result. The newly calculated address is stored in 'end_boundary_addr' for use in subsequent operations.
