It checks a data_error_i input signal and if a data error is detected, it latches relevant status/error information into 'error_status' register. This information includes the data that was being compared, the read data, the address at which this comparison was made, the burst length, and the status of the memory controller buffers (whether cmd, wr are full or rd is empty). A reset or manual clear error signal can be used to clear the error_status register. This status information could then be used for debugging or reporting errors."
