    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to implement a data pattern generator using PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) or ALL pattern. The control of this block is asserted with the enable signal, \"data_clk_en\", which is active when the FIFO is ready, the data is ready, and the user burst count is more than one. A PRBS generator/data pattern generator is instantiated and takes the input signals \"clk_i\", \"rst_i\", and a seeding signal amongst others, then it outputs the PRBS data \"prbs_o\". This block can be useful for simulating random data transmission scenarios."
