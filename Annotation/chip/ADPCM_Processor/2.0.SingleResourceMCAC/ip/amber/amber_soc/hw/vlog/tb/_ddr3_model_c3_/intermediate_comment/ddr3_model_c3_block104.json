    "block_comment": "This block of code executes a timing check function `dq_timing_check` when there's a change in the 27th bit of the data queue input, `dq_in[26]`. The block utilizes Verilog's `always` keyword in conjunction with a sensitivity list, specifically targeting changes in the value of `dq_in[26]`. This means the block will be executed at any event where that bit has its value modified. This digital circuit mimics asynchronous behavior on a given bit, allowing for continuous monitoring and subsequent timing checks whenever changes are observed."
