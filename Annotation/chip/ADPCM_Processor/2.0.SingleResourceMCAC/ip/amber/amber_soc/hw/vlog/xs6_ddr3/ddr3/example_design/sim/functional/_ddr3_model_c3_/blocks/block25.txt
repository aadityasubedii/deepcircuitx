This block triggers a timing check procedure whenever there is a negative edge in the 8th bit of the dqs_in array. The implementation is achieved through the 'always' keyword in Verilog which creates a procedural block that reacts on the edge of its sensitivity list, expressed here as 'negedge dqs_in[ 7]'. The block calls the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function with '7' as an argument representing the specific bit in the array for the timing check.
