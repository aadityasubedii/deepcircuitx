    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a Serializer/Deserializer (SERDES) interface with a Master role that is set up with a two-bit data width. The SERDES operates following specific clock timings that correspond to the conditions set, including a 90-degree IO clock (ioclk90) and an internal system reset (int_sys_rst). The SERDES input contains signals from the data query phase latch module (dqplm) and the data query negative latch module (dqnlm). Output signals are sent to ldm_oq and ldm_t. Additionally, data query IO write enable (dqIO_w_en_0) is used for control input. The setup involves forced clock divisions and certain clock enables being tied to a logic high, while outputs are left unconnected."
