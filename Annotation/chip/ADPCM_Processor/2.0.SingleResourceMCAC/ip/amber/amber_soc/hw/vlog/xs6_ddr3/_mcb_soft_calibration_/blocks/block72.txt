Comment: 
This line of code defines a temporary reset signal, `rst_tmp`. The signal is active (logic high) when both the `PLL_LOCK_R2` and `SELFREFRESH_MODE` signals are inactive (logic low). This is achieved by using the bitwise NOT (`~`) operator which inverts the logic state of the signals, and the logical AND (`&&`) operator, which only results in a logic high if both inputs are high. This indicates the reset is connected to the inverse of the PLL lock status and the self-refresh mode, asserting reset only when both are inactive.
