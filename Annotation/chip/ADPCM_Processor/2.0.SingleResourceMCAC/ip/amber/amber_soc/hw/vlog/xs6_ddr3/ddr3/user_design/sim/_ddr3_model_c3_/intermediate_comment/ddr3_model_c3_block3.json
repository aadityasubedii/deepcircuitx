    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a negative timing check or edge detection. The function is triggered at the rising edge of the 30th bit (index 29) of the signal 'dqs_in'. This specific implementation allows us to monitor this bit and perform a specific operation (i.e., call the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check') whenever this bit transitions from low to high."
