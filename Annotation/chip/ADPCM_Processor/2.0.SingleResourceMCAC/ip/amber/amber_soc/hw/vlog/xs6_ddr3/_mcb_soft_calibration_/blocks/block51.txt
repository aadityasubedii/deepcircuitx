Comment: 
The block performs a multiplexing function in which control signals are configured according to the value of Active_IODRP. It makes use of a case statement to determine the configuration of three signals: RZQ_IODRP_CS, ZIO_IODRP_CS, and IODRP_SDO. These signals are assigned different values based on whether Active_IODRP matches with 'RZQ', 'ZIO', 'MCB_PORT', or fails to meet any of the conditions. The latter two scenarios will lead to the assignment of '0' to all three signals.
