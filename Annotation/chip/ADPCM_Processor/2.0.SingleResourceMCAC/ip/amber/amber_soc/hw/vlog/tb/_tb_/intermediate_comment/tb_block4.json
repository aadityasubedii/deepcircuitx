    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is responsible for test result evaluation and display. If the 'test_status_set' signal is high or if 'testfail' occurs, it will assess 'test_status_reg' and display different messages accordingly. If the value of 'test_status_reg' is 32'd17 and 'testfail' is not asserted, it passes the test and outputs this status. Conversely, for the scenario where 'testfail' is raised or when the 'test_status_reg' is not equal to 32'd17, it's considered as a test failure and logs the failure reason, either due to a specific error code if 'test_status_reg' value is at least 32'h8000 or indicating the error line number otherwise. These status information is both shown on the console and written into a log file."
