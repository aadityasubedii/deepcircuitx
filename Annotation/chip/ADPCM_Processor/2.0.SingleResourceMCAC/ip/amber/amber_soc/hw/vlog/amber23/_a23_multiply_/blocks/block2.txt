Comment: 
The block assigns the 32 least significant bits of the variable "product" to the variable "o_out". This is achieved through the use of the "assign" keyword, which sets "o_out" equal to the slice of "product" specified by the range 32:1. This implementation allows "o_out" to ignore the most significant bit of "product", potentially reducing the impact of overflow conditions.
