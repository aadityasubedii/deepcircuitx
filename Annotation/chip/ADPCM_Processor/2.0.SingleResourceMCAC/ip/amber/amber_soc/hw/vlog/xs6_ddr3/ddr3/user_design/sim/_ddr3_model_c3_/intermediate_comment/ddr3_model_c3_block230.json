    "block_comment": "The function `get_rtt_wr` computes the value of the rtt_wr parameter. It takes a 2-bit binary input, pads it with a '0' on the right side to make up a 3-bit binary number, and then it performs a division operation with the 'RZQ'. The resulting value of get_rtt_wr is returned as an integer."
