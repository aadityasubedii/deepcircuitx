    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for toggling the 'end_addr_reached' signal based on whether set conditions related to 'upper_end_matched', 'lower_end_matched', 'FAMILY', and 'DWIDTH' are met. The conditions consider different combinations of match flags and specific family-DWIDTH pairings. When any one of these conditions is true at a rising edge of the input clock, 'end_addr_reached' is set to high (1). Otherwise, 'end_addr_reached' is kept low (0). This implies it's marking the end of an address reach based on pre-determined conditions and parameters."
