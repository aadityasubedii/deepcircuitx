    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential logic implementation in Verilog RTL, which is crucial for digital applications. The block operation is contingent on the rising edges of Clk or Reset. If Reset is high, three registers, Mdo_2d, Mdo_d, and Mdo, are assigned the value of zero with the delay of #Tp time units. If Reset is low and MdcEn_n is high, the Mdo_2d register is assigned the logical AND of the negation of SerialEn and the condition of BitCounter being less than 32 after a delay of #Tp time units. Similarly, Mdo_d is assigned the logical OR of ShiftedBit and Mdo_2d, and Mdo is assigned the value of Mdo_d, each after a delay of #Tp time units."
