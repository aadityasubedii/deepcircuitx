    "block_comment": "This block of code is conditionally error checking the read data for half of the data pins in a specific Virtex family FPGA. This is done by comparing each byte of data of the read data (rd_v6_mdata) with the comparison data (cmp_data) only when the read data fifo is not empty and read data enable signal is active. The result is assigned to the error_byte array, where every element indicates whether there was an error in the specific byte."
