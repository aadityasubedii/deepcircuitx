    "block_comment": "This block of code runs a timing check on the command address. This is implemented with an always block in Verilog, signifying that the operation is continuously active. This block is sensitive to the 5th bit of \"addr_in\" vector. Whenever the 5th bit of the \"addr_in\" value changes, it invokes \"cmd_addr_timing_check\" function with parameter 11."
