Comment: 
This block of code is used for managing the count of user data bursts in a synchronous digital system. It gets triggered at every positive clock edge and the behavior is determined based on the inputs (rst_i[0], cmd_start, bl_i, data_port_fifo_rdy). When the reset signal (rst_i[0]) is high, the user burst count is set to 0 irrespective of other inputs. If reset is not triggered and a start command (cmd_start) is received, if the burst length supplied (bl_i) is zero, the burst count is set to '1000000', otherwise it's set to the supplied burst length itself. In absence of a reset or a start command, if the data port FIFO is ready (data_port_fifo_rdy), the user burst count is decreased by 1 until burst count reaches zero.
