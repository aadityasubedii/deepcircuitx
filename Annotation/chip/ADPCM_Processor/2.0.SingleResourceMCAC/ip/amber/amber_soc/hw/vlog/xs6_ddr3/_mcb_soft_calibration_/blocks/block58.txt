Comment: 
This block describes a sequential circuit state machine that transitions to the dynamic calibration start state. On every positive edge of UI_CLK, if RST is asserted, the State_Start_DynCal is reset to 0. If the present state (STATE) is START_DYN_CAL, State_Start_DynCal is also set to 1, indicating the beginning of dynamic calibration. In all other cases, State_Start_DynCal remains or is set to 0.
