This Verilog block is fundamentally about the assignment of different MIG controller states to a set of local variables. It initially assigns the command empty/full states from MIG controller to local p3_cmd variables. Then, in separate, it assigns values related to read, write, error, overflow, and underrun status for four different processes p0, p1, p2, and p3. These values include data, empty, full, error, overflow (for read), and underrun & error (for write). Assigning these states from the MIG controller to local process specific variables can be used later for more intuitive and process-specific controls and checks.
