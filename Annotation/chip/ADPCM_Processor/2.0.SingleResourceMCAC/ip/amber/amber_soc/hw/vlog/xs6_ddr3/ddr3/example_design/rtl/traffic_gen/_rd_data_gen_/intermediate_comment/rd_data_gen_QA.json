It is highly parametric and can be configured for different needs based on parameters such as address width, data width, burst length, and the family of FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) it targets (SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6 are supported). It checks if responses from the environment are ready and whether commands are valid. The data generation can be static or random with configurable parameters. The module is also responsible for controlling the start of commands and keeps track of the user's burst count. Different Logics are handled based on whether the targeted FPGA family is SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6. For example, a different data generation instantiation (SP6_DGEN and V6_DGEN) is called based on the FPGA family. The module also keeps track of the last word in a transmission."
