    "block_comment": "This Verilog block triggers a positive edge timing check function whenever there is a positive edge on the 6th bit of the `dqs_in` signal. When the specified trigger condition is met, the function `dqs_pos_timing_check` is invoked with the parameter `5`. This mechanism provides timing control based on the state changes of the `dqs_in` signal."
