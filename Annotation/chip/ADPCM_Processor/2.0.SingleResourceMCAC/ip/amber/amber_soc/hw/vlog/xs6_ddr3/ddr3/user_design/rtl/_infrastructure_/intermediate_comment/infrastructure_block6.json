    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the state of the PLL lock during power up in a system. It is particularly designed to reset the `powerup_pll_locked` signal to LOW when a system reset (`sys_rst`) occurs. However, if the Multiple Clock Buffers PLL (`bufpll_mcb_locked`) is locked, then it sets the `powerup_pll_locked` signal to HIGH. This behavior is triggered on the rising edge of the MCB DRP clock (`mcb_drp_clk`) or the system reset."
