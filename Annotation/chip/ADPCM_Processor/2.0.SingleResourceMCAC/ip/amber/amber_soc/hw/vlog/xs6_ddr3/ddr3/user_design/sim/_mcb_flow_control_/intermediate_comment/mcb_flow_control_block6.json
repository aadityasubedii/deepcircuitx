    "block_comment": "This block assigns command values for write, read, and other operations. It performs this function by using bitwise operations to check conditions associated with input command variables (cmd_i and cmd_valid_i). If the condition ((cmd_i equals to WR or WRP) and cmd_valid_i is true) is met, cmd_wr is assigned 1, else 0. Similarly, cmd_rd is assigned 1 when ((cmd_i equals to RD or RDP) and cmd_valid_i is true). For cmd_others, it is assigned 1 if the third bit of cmd_i is 1 and cmd_valid_i is true and also if the FAMILY is set to \"SPARTAN6\", else it is assigned 0."
