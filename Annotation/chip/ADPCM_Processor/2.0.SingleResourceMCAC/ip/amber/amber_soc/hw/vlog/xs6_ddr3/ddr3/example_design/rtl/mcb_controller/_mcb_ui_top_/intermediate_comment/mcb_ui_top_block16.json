    "block_comment": "This block of code is conditional assignment for communication interface parameters when the flag C_S3_AXI_ENABLE is disabled. The code assigns values from input signals to the corresponding interface signals for different conformities such as command, write, and read related functions (designated by signatures viz 'cmd', 'wr', 'rd'). The selected signals concern command enablers, clock signals, instruction info, address, data, status, and error flags etc. This block serves to mirror the external signals to internal system when the AXI interface is not enabled thereby maintaining the continuity in information flow."
