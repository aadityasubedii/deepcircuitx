This block performs conditional data assignment for read operations. If the data read from the Wishbone Bus (i_wb_read_data_valid) is valid, then the block assigns the value of read_data_filtered to read_data_filtered_c. Otherwise, the previous read data value (read_data_filtered_r) is assigned to read_data_filtered_c.
