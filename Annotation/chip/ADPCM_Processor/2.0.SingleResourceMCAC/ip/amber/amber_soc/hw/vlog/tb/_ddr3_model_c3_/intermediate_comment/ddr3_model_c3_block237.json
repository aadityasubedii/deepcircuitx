    "block_comment": "This block is used for signal delay modeling. It delays the 'dq' signal by a predetermined constant time, defined as 'BUS_DELAY', in order to mimic a real-life bus signal propagation delay. This implementation is achieved using an 'always' block that continuously monitors the 'dq' signal for changes. Once a change is detected, it triggers a non-blocking assignment statement that assigns the new 'dq' value to 'dq_in' after the 'BUS_DELAY' time period."
