    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the interface between a user interface and a memory controller block (MCB) with options for AXI/Simple interface. Checks if AXI enable flag (C_S3_AXI_ENABLE) is set. If not, bypasses the hardware and directly assigns the user interface inputs to the MCB input ports. If AXI is enabled, it performs interfaces using AXI protocol by instantiating axi_mcb and axi_mcb_synch modules. The AXI address masks are applied before passing to the mcb module. Output and input signals are assigned to be interfaced with axi_mcb."
