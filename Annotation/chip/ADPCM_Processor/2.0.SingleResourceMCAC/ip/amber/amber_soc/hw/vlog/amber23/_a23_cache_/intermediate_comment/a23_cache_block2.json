    "block_comment": "This block checks for multiple cache hits. It uses Verilog's procedural always block to sequentially execute on the positive edge of 'i_clk'. The sum of data_hit_way[0] to data_hit_way[7] is checked, if it is more than 1, it indicates multiple cache hits. In such an event, it generates an error message \"Hit in more than one cache ways!\" to inform of the abnormal scenario."
