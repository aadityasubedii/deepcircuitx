    "block_comment": "This block functions as a control structure for configuring memory cell address, write mode, write data, the MCB UI address and validating MCB commands based on ready/busy line state in the LDQS_PIN_WRITE_N_TERM state of a finite state machine. The block uses assigned statements to set configuration parameters such as IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR, IODRPCTRLR_R_WB and others. It also uses a conditional ('if') statement to determine the next state in the FSM based on the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal. If the signal indicates readiness, the FSM remains in the current state. If not, it transitions to the LDQS_PIN_N_TERM_WAIT state."
