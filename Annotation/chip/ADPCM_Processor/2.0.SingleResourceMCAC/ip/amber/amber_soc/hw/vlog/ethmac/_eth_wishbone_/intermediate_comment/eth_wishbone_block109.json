    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential always block in Verilog that is used to manage the control signal, LatchValidBytes_q. It is triggered on the positive edge of either the WB_CLK_I signal or the Reset signal. If the Reset signal is high, the signal LatchValidBytes_q is set to off or would otherwise assume the value of the LatchValidBytes signal. This block functions as a fundamental element in synchronous designs and often employed as a flip-flop unit."
