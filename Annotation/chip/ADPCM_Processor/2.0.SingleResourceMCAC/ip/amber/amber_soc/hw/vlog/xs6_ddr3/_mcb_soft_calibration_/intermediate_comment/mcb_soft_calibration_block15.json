    "block_comment": "This code block provides a mechanism for state transition in a finite state machine design. Specifically, it uses a `Block_Reset` signal to decide which state the machine will transition to: if the `Block_Reset` signal is active, the FSM transitions into the `RST_DELAY` state; otherwise, it moves into the `START_DYN_CAL_PRE` state. This conditional statement controls the behavior of the FSM based on the reset signal, facilitating the system's operational flow and enabling system reset functionality."
