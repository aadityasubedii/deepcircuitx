Comment: 
The block of code describes a write operation in a non-blocking concurrent memory system under certain conditions. On the rising edge of the write clock signal (`wr_clk`), if the write enable signal (`wr_en`) is high and the memory is not full (`!full`), the block writes the data from `wr_data` to the memory address referenced by `wr_addr`. The writing process is delayed by `#TCQ` time units, ensuring ordered execution in the sequential logic.
