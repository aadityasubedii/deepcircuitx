    "block_comment": "This block of code is a Verilog RTL code for a task named `warmreg`. The purpose of this task is to write register names to a file based on the provided register number. If the register number is less than 12, it simply writes \"r\" followed by the register number to the file. For register numbers from 12 to 15, it writes specific strings \"ip\", \"sp\", \"lr\", and \"pc\" to the file respectively. This is done using $fwrite function of Verilog which writes data into the specified file, and a case statement for handling different specific register numbers."
