    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is primarily responsible for the implementation of a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) generator using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). If a seed initialization (prbs_seed_init) is taking place during the positive edge of a clock cycle (posedge clk_i), the code fills the register lfsr_q with an initial seed value (prbs_seed_i[14:0]), extended with five zeroes. Otherwise, if the clock enable (clk_en) is set, a shift and feedback operation is almost certainly happening where individual bits of the LFSR are shifted into their adjacent higher-order positions, and the output is fed back into the input. The feedback function is the XOR of the 20th and 17th bits."
