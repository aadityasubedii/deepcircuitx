    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) using a seed value for pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) generation. On each clock cycle, it checks if the PRBS seed needs initialization - in that case, it populates the 33-bit register 'lfsr_q' with the seed value. If not, there is selective shifting and bitwise XOR processing in the register: the 24 MSBs are up-shifted, and the 9 LSBs updated based on XOR operations involving the register's other bits. The XOR operations and selective shifting are typical characteristics of a Galois LFSR."
