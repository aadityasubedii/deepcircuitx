This block is a reset logic module for a memory controller design. It is designed to operate on the positive edge of the UI_CLK signal. Upon reset, it initializes all associated registers and controller signals to their default state. The reset action is triggered by RST_reg signal, following which all parameters like MCB_CMD_VALID, MCB_UIADDR, MCB_UICMDEN, MCB_UIDONECAL, etc. are set to their respective initial values to prepare the system for the new operation cycle. If reset, MCB_UIADDR, and similar parameters are all assigned their respective 0 values, signifying a clear state. Meanwhile, the control signals like MCB_UICMDEN and MCB_UIDRPUPDATE are set to 1, indicating enablement. After the reset operation is completed, the memory controller can proceed to the next operation with a clean slate. The state is also set to START, readying the system for the next operation sequence.
