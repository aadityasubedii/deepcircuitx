Module-level comment: This module generates various data patterns for memory testing, including PRBS, address-based, walking 1's/0's, neighbor, and hammer patterns. It supports different memory widths and burst lengths. The module selects and generates patterns based on input mode, using internal counters, shift registers, and pattern-specific logic. It implements configurable victim line selection for hammer patterns and supports eye testing mode. The module outputs the generated data patterns synchronized with clock and control signals.
