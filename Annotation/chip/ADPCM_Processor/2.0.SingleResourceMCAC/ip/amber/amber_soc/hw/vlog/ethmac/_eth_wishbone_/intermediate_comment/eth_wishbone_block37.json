    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for synchronizing the reception of a frame (SyncRxStartFrm) based on the state of `LatchedRxStartFrm` and `Reset`. Implemented as an always block that triggers at every positive edge of `WB_CLK_I` (a system clock), or if a system reset (`Reset`) is activated. If the system reset is activated, it sets the value of `SyncRxStartFrm` to 0 with a delay specified by #Tp. If a latch frame reception (`LatchedRxStartFrm`) is detected, `SyncRxStartFrm` is set to 1, otherwise, it remains 0, both using a delay specified by #Tp."
