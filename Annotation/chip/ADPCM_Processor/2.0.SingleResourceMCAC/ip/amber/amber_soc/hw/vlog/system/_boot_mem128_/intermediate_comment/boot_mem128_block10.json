    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is meant to trigger a read operation. Whenever there is a positive edge (rising edge) detected on the 'i_wb_clk' signal, it initiates the process described inside the 'always' block. In this case, the 'start_read_r' register gets the value of the 'start_read' signal. This is a basic implementation of a clocked register, where the value of 'start_read' gets stored in 'start_read_r' on each rising clock edge."
