It is designed to store and retrieve data efficiently, with byte-level control. The SRAM's width is 128 bits, and it features byte enabling for writing data. It uses four internal blocks of dual-port RAM (RAMB8BWER), each accommodating 32 bits for both write and read operations. The RAM data width, address width, clock inputs, read/write enable signals, and the behavior of the write operation are parameterized. There is also a rudimentary check during initialization to ensure that DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH parameters are set correctly."
