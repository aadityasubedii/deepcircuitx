    "block_comment": "The block performs a generation of read data for a memory module. It leverages parameters like TCQ, FAMILY, MEM_BURST_LEN, NUM_DQ_PINS, SEL_VICTIM_LINE, DATA_PATTERN, DWIDTH, COLUMN_WIDTH to define its behavioral aspects. Clock and reset signals are input to keep synchronization, while data_mode_i, gen_valid, and fixed_data_i signals steer its operation. Status signals like gen_rdy, last_word_rd_o, cmp_valid, and others are output to communicate state changes and data flow. The function uses a seed for PRBS and inputs an address and burst length to get data generated, which is available at cmp_data."
