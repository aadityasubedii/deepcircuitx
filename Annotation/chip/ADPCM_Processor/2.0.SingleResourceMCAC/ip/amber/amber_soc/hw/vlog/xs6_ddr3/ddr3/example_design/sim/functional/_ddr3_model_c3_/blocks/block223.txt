The function `read_from_file` reads a specific chunk of data from a file indexed by the parameter `index`. The function opens the file with the file descriptor `fd` and seeks to the offset calculated based upon `index` and `RFF_CHUNK`. If the file seek fails, an error message is displayed and simulation is stopped. Next, it attempts to read a data value from the file. If the reading fails, an error message regarding the failure is displayed along with the specific error message. Finally, the function manages unknown 'bz value and assigns an all unknown 'hx if the value read was a zero. It returns the read value.
