This block performs address mapping for a memory controller. Its function is to translate byte addresses into row, bank, and column addresses for memory access. The implementation details are as follows:

The block handles different memory configurations (x16, x8, x4) and address orderings (ROW_BANK_COLUMN or BANK_ROW_COLUMN). It uses generate statements to create the appropriate logic based on the configuration parameters. For each port (p0 to p5), it assigns row address (ra), bank address (ba), and column address (ca) by extracting the relevant bits from the byte address. The exact bit ranges depend on the memory width, address width, bank address width, and number of column bits. The block also handles cases where the actual widths are less than the maximum possible, padding with zeros as needed.
