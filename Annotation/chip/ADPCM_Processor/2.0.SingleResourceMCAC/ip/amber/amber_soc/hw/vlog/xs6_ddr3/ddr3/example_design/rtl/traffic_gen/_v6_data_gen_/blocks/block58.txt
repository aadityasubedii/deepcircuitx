Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for data stream generation based on data mode and address input during a positive clock edge event. When `cmd_startC` is true, the module checks whether `sel_w1gen_logic` is also true. If true, different data is generated based on the address input and data mode. Data is produced using `Data_Gen` or `Data_GenW0` functions depending on the data mode, and then assigned to `w1data` with a delay of `TCQ`. If the selected address wasn't within the given options (0~3), 'b0 is assigned. If `cmd_startC` isn't enabled but the memory burst length is 8, the block substitutes a portion of the original `w1data` with a shifted version of it, which seems to be a part of data shuffling or arranging operation.
