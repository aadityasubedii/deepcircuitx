    "module": "Module-level comment:\n\nThe `interrupt_controller` module handles system interrupts by enabling, disabling, and setting IRQs and FIRQs. It interfaces with components like UARTs and Ethernet MAC and supports the Wishbone Bus protocol. Internally, it uses registers and wires to carry out read and write operations and process interrupt signals. It starts with collecting raw interrupt signals, applies masking, and finally generates the interrupt request signals. The module also includes debug support for trace access to the registers."
