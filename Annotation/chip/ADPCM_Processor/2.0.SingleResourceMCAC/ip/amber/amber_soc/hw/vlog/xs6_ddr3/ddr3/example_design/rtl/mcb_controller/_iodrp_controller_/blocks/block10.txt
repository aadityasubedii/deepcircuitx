This block of code generates a ready/busy signal (rdy_busy_n). It checks if a particular state-variable equals to "READY". If "READY", rdy_busy_n is set to 1 (true), otherwise 0 (false). The equality check is done using the '==' operator and the assigned value is a boolean resulting from this condition check.
