This block of Verilog RTL code acts as a data error detection mechanism, displaying an error when inconsistencies between expected and received data are observed. Upon the positive edge of clk_i, the system resets and clears error indicators if the rst1_i or manual_clear_error conditions are met. If these conditions aren't met, data error and error_byte_r1 are updated with the respective values of error_byte and a bitwise OR operation on error_byte_r1. If a data_error persists, a diagnostic message detailing the expected and received data along with the time of occurrence is displayed.
