    "block_comment": "The block of code is a delay CRC counter for transmission. This statement gets evaluated for a positive edge of MTxClk clock signal or a transmission reset (TxReset) signal. If the TxReset or ResetByteCnt signal is high, then the DlyCrcCnt counter is reset to 0 with a propagation delay of Tp. But if IncrementDlyCrcCnt signal is high, then DlyCrcCnt increments by 1 with a propagation delay of Tp."
