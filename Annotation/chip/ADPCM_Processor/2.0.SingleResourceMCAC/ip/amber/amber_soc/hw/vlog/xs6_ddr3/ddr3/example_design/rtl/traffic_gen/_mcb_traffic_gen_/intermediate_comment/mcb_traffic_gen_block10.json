    "block_comment": "This block manages a flag to indicate whether the read data FIFO is full or not. It primarily operates on the positive edge of the input clock. When the reset signal 'rst_rb[0]' is high, it resets the 'rd_mdata_afull_set' to 0, thus indicating the read data FIFO is not full. However, when the 'rd_mdata_fifo_afull' signal is high, it sets the 'rd_mdata_afull_set' to 1, signaling that the read data FIFO is full. The delay #TCQ highlights a delay posed by the propagation delay of the circuit."
