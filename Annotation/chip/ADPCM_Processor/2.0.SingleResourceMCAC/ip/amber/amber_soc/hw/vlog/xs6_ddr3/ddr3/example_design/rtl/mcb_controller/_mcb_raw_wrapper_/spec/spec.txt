Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: The mcb_raw_wrapper module is a Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper for DDR memory interfaces, supporting various memory types (DDR, DDR2, DDR3) and configurations. It handles I/O and control signals for memory operations, including address, data, and command signals. The module has numerous input ports for clock, reset, command, and data signals from up to six user ports, as well as output ports for memory interface signals and status information. Key internal signals include clock and reset management, data path control, and calibration signals. The module is organized into several main sections: port configuration and signal routing, IODRP2 instantiations for I/O delay and calibration, OSERDES2 instantiations for output serialization, and IOBUF/OBUFT instantiations for physical I/O connections.
