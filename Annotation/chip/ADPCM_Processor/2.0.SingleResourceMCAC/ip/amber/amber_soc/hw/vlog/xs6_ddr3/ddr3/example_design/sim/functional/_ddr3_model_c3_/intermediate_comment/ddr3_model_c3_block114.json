    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a procedural block that initiates the function dq_timing_check, specifically when there's a change in the 17th bit of the dq_in data stream. This procedural block utilizes an \"always\" loop which triggers the dq_timing_check function whenever dq_in[16] undergoes a change, to verify if timing constraints for the specific bit are met."
