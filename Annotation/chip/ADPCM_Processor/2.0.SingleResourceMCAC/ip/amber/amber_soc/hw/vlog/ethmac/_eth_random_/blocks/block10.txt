Comment: 
This line of code performs a conditional assignment to the fourth bit of the 'Random' vector. Specifically, it examines the 'RetryCnt' variable. If this Retry count is greater than 3, it assigns the value of the fourth bit in the 'x' vector to the fourth bit of the 'Random' vector; otherwise, it assigns a binary zero.
