Module-level comment: The tg_status module monitors and sets the status of data errors and memory controller buffer statuses in a test generator. It detects data errors through inputs, sets an error flag, and updates a comprehensive error status containing error details. In addition, it allows manual or system-controlled error clearance. This is achieved using internal registered signals to handle error detection with delay, and different code blocks to manage status updating and error clearance.
