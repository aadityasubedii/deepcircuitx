    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating the 'adata' register based on different conditions and system configuration. On a positive edge of the 'clk_i' input signal, if the 'cmd_startD' flag is set, the 'adata' register is updated with the value of 'addr_i' after a delay defined by 'TCQ'. When this flag isn't set, and if 'fifo_rdy_i', 'data_rdy_i' are both true and 'user_burst_cnt' is greater than 1, the 'adata' register is incremented. The increment step is decided by the 'DWIDTH' parameter: 'adata' is increased by 16 if 'DWIDTH' equals 128, by 8 if 'DWIDTH' equals 64, and by 4 otherwise."
