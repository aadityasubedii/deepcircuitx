    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for managing the 'CarrierSenseLost' signal in a network transmission context. It operates on the rising edge of MTxClk clock signal or when a reset signal is detected. After a reset, 'CarrierSenseLost' is cleared. If the state is 'StatePreamble' or any 'StateData' and no 'CarrierSense', 'Loopback', 'Collision', and 'r_FullD' are detected, 'CarrierSenseLost' gets set, indicating a loss of carrier during transmission. However, when the transmission starts ('TxStartFrm' is true), 'CarrierSenseLost' is reset signaling the start of a new frame transmission."
