    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for timing examination on the falling edge of the digital quad signal (dqs_in[2]). The implementation is accomplished by asserting the `dqs_neg_timing_check (2)` function whenever a negative-edge happens on `dqs_in[2]`. The function then checks whether timing is correctly implemented for the given signal."
