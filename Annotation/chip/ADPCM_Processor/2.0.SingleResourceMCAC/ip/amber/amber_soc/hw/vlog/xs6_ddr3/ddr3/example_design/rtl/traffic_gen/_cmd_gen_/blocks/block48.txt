Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for conditionally assigning address values to the 'pipe_data_in' bus based on input conditions. On each positive edge of 'clk_i', if 'rst_i' is set, it initializes the 'pipe_data_in' with 'start_addr_i'. If 'instr_vld' is asserted, the address assignment depends on various conditions like 'gen_addr_larger', 'addr_mode_reg', 'NUM_DQ_PINS' and 'MEM_BURST_LEN'. When 'gen_addr_larger' is true and 'addr_mode_reg' matches certain patterns, 'end_addr_i' with lower 8 bits as '0' is assigned to 'pipe_data_in'. For various ranges of 'NUM_DQ_PINS', different parts of 'addr_out' concatenated with zeros are assigned to 'pipe_data_in' depending on 'MEM_BURST_LEN'. This handles different addressing modes for data transfer.
