    "module": "Module-level Comment: The eth_transmitcontrol module manages control frame transmission for an Ethernet system using Verilog RTL. It handles flow regulation, transmission completion, and interaction with the MAC layer through its inputs. It generates control frame data, handles start and end of transmission, blocks 'done' signals, and schedules future transmissions using its output ports. Internally, it uses registers to track control frame transmissions, count CRC delays and bytes, detect control frame ends, store data, and block transmission-done signals. The module controls the count operations, increments byte count, identifies control frame end, generates and delivers control frame data under various conditions using procedural blocks. It's tailored to meet specific requirements for efficient Ethernet transmission control."
