    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the bit-length of a Pseudo-Random Bit Sequence (PRBS), dependent on the hardware family. If the chip belongs to the SPARTAN6 family, then the length of the PRBS is set to 'prbs_bl' if it's not zero, or to 1 if 'prbs_bl' is zero. If the chip does not belong to the SPARTAN6 family, then the length of the PRBS is set to 2 by default."
