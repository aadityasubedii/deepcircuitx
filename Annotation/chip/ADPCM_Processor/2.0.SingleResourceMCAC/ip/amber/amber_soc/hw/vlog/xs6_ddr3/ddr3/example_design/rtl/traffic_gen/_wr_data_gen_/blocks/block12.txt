The block of code is generating an output signal 'last_word_o' that indicates when the last word is being processed in a function or module. It achieves this function by taking a bitwise AND operation between the output of a counter module 'u_bcount_2' and a condition check 'fifo_not_full', where 'u_bcount_2' presumably counts some aspect of the data processing and 'fifo_not_full' verifies if a FIFO (First In, First Out) storage buffer associated is not full.
