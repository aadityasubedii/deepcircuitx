This block is designated to always check the timing of dq_in data bit at index position 47. It uses the dq_timing_check method for this particular task. When a change is detected in the bit of dq_in at the 47th position (dq_in[47]), the block will always invoke the function dq_timing_check with 47 as an argument.
