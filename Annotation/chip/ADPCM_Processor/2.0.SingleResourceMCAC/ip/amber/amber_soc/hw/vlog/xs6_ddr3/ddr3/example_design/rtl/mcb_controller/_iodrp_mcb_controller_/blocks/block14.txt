The block performs data and mode setting operations on the rising edge of the DRP_CLK signal. When the system state is 'READY', the block assigns the value of 'memcell_address' to 'memcell_addr_reg', the value of 'write_data' to 'data_reg', and the value of 'rd_not_write' to 'rd_not_write_reg'. This is a memory control function that sets the memory cell address, the data to be written, and the mode of operation (read or write).
