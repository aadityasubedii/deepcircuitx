This block manages the visual representation of the transmission FIFO status in the test module. The two least significant bits of the `tb_uart_status_reg` register provide this status. It indicates whether the transmission FIFO is full or empty by assigning the `txfifo_full` and `txfifo_empty` signals respectively to the two aforementioned bits.
