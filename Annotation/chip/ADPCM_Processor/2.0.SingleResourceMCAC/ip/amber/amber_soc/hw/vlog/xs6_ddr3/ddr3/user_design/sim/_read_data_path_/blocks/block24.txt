Comment: 
This line of code assigns the value of the internal signal `rd_mdata` to the external output signal `rd_mdata_o`. This is a simple assignment operation that passes the value of the internal wire or register to the output whenever the right-hand side (`rd_mdata`) changes, ensuring that the external signal `rd_mdata_o` always matches the current state of `rd_mdata`. The operation is done continuously and automatically by the hardware.
