The block of code is essentially a D flip-flop that captures the state of some signals on the rising edge of the write-back clock (i_wb_clk). Each signal in the block is latched on the rising edge of the clock. current_master signal is simply captured. m0_wb_hold_r and m1_wb_hold_r signals are ANDed with the negation of o_m0_wb_ack and o_m1_wb_ack signals respectively before being captured. This is typically a way of implementing flow control mechanics in bus protocols, where these signals might indicate a hold condition (the master is requesting the bus and has yet to receive acknowledgement).
