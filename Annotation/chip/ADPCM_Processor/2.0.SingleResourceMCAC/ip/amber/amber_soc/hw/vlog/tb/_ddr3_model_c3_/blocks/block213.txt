This block of code implements a task called `cmd_task` that handles various DDR SDRAM commands and performs timing checks. Here's a summary of its function and implementation:

[Function of the block]. The `cmd_task` processes DDR SDRAM commands, performs timing checks, and updates the memory state based on the received commands. It handles operations such as Load Mode Register, Refresh, Precharge, Activate, Write, Read, ZQ Calibration, and Power Down/Self Refresh modes.

[Implementation details of the block]. The task uses a series of conditional statements to check the current command and memory state. It verifies timing parameters, updates internal counters and flags, and performs the appropriate actions for each command. The task also checks for illegal operations and timing violations, displaying error messages when necessary. It maintains the state of banks, rows, and columns, and manages features like auto-precharge, burst operations, and power management modes. The implementation includes detailed checks for various DDR SDRAM timing parameters and operational rules, ensuring proper functionality and compliance with the DDR SDRAM specification.
