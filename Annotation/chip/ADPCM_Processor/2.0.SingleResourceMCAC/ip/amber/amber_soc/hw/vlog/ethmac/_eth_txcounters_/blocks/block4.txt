Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages the byte count (ByteCnt). When the positive edge of either the Master Transmit Clock (MTxClk) or a Reset occurs, the block executes. If a Reset is flagged, the byte count is reset to zero. Alternatively, if a byte count reset (ResetByteCnt) is flagged, the counter is also reset to zero, but if an increment byte count (IncrementByteCnt) is flagged, the byte count is incremented by one. The execution of operations is placed with delay '#Tp', which could be regulatory for synchronization in the waveform.
