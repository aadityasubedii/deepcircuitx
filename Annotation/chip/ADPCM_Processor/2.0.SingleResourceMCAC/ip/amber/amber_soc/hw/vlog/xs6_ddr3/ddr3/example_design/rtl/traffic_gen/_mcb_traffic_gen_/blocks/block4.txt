Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is used to set or initialize the error status of a comparison operation. The 'cmp_error' is a signal that is assigned a default value of '1'b0', which is equivalent to boolean 'false' or zero in digital logic. This indicates that there is no error in the comparison operation to start with. The signal 'cmp_error' would be set high or true (1'b1) if an error is encountered during the comparison operation.
