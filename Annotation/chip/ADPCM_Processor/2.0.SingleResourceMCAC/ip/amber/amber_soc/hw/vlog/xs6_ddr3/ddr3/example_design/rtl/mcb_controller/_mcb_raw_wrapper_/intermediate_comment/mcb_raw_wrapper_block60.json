    "block_comment": "This block configures the read path of a memory interface for different sorts of memory units. If the memory is 4-ported, 32-bit, and the Read port width is also 32 bits, several variables are set to their corresponding 'mig_p4' counterparts, effectively enabling data reading, clock signalling, checking for errors, full/empty states, and the data count. If the port is not enabled, these variables are assigned a zero, signaling that no action is currently being implemented."
