    "block_comment": "The block of code performs a timing check on the 51st bit (index 50) of the digital data signal dq_in. Whenever there is a change in the signal's value at the 51st bit, an event is triggered to call the function dq_timing_check() with the current value of the 51st bit as an argument. The function dq_timing_check() is expected to take necessary actions for timing adjustment or validation based on the value of the bit."
