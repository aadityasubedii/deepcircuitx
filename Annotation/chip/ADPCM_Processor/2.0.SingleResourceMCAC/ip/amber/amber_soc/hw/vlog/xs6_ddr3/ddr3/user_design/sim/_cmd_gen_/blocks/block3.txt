Comment: 
The block of code acts as an error-detection mechanism specifically for the VIRTEX6 family by checking the burst length (bl_out). If the burst length surpasses the stipulated threshold of 2 in a VIRTEX6 instance, an error message is displayed and the program execution is forcefully stopped. The block's function is achieved through Verilog's conditional structures, system tasks - $display and $stop, and the use of some predefined constants.
