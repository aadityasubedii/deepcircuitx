    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is implementing a shift register and additional control logic with reset capability. At the positive rising edge of a clock signal or a reset signal, if the reset signal is high, the shift register, Prsd registers and the LinkFail flag are reset to zero. Otherwise, it checks the MdcEn_n signal. If MdcEn_n is high and any bit in ByteSelect is high, the ShiftReg is loaded with different bit patterns according to the value of ByteSelect. If MdcEn_n is high and all the bits of ByteSelect are zero, ShiftReg is shifted right by 1 bit. If LatchByte[0] or LatchByte[1] are high, Prsd is loaded with the value of ShiftReg. The LinkFail flag is set to the inverse of ShiftReg[1] if Rgad equals 1."
