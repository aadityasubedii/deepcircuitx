It contains various registers, each being 32 bits in size. Each register is capable of storing values given to it provided the respective 'write enable' signal is high. The values in the registers can be selected using the selection signals and used elsewhere in the code. Notably, the module differentiates some registers according to execution modes of the processor like user mode, supervisor mode, IRQ execution mode, and FIRQ execution mode. The module also handles some status flags and masks these with some register outputs. This module likely forms a part of a larger processor design where it serves to provide workspace registers and manages the program counter and some related functionality like interrupts."
