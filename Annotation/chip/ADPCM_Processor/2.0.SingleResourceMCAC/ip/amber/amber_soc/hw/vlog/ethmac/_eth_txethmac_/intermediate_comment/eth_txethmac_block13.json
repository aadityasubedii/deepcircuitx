    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a retry counter in a Verilog-based system, either resetting the counter or incrementing it based on different conditions. On positive edge of MTxClk or Reset signal, if Reset is high, the RetryCnt is reset to zero. Otherwise, it checks several conditions including ExcessiveDeferOccured, UnderRun, TooBig, StartTxDone, TxUnderRun and a combination of StateJam, NibCntEq7, ColWindow, RetryMax flags. If any of them is true, RetryCnt is reset. In other case, if the stated condition involving StateJam, NibCntEq7, ColWindow, RandomEq0, NoBckof, StateBackOff, and RandomEqByteCnt is true, then RetryCnt is incremented by one. The effects are applied after the delay represented by #Tp."
