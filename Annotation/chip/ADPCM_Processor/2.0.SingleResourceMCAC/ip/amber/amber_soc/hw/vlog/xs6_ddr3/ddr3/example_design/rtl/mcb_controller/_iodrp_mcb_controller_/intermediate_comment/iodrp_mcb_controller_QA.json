The main purpose of this design is to control a DRP (Dynamic Reconfiguration Port) interface that can read/write to/from memory cells, which are used for dynamic reconfiguration of a system. The module takes input signals like a read/write control signal, a valid command signal, a reset signal, a DRP clock signal, etc. and provides output signals like a ready/busy signal, control signal for DRP, data out for DRP, etc. The module is written keeping a FSM (Finite State Machine) structure in mind, which goes through different states for its operation like Ready, Decide, Address Phase, Data Phase, etc. Moreover, it also includes some helper tasks and functions to perform sub-tasks such as expanding and shifting data."
