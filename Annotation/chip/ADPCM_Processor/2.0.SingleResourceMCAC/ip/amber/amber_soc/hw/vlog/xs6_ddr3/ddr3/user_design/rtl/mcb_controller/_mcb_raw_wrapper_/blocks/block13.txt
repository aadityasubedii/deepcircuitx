This block of code in Verilog generates a collection of output buffers with tri-state control (OBUFTs) for driving address signals onto a memory bus. For each bit in the memory address width (C_MEM_ADDR_WIDTH), it creates an instance of the OBUFT (iob_addr_inst), which is assigned an input (I) from the internal address signal array (ioi_addr), a tri-state control (T) based on the corresponding control signal array (t_addr), and drives its output (O) onto the corresponding bit of the memory channel address signal (mcbx_dram_addr).
