The block of code is a sequential logic that controls the status of the 'cke_train_reg' signal. If the system is in reset ('int_sys_rst' is high), the 'cke_train_reg' is set to 0. If not in reset, the block checks two conditions: if 'wait_200us_done_r1' is high and 'wait_200us_done_r2' is low, then 'cke_train_reg' gets set to 1. Else, if 'uo_done_cal' is high, 'cke_train_reg' gets reset to 0. The code functions as a controller based on certain flags to trigger or deactivate the 'cke_train_reg' signal.
