Comment: 
The block manages the SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ signal based on various conditions. The SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ signal is reset on a rising edge UI_CLK trigger, if RST is true. Additionally, it is set to 0 when the PLL_LOCK_R2 is asserted and SELFREFRESH_REQ_R3 is not asserted. However, it sets the SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ signal to 1 when the system is in the START_DYN_CAL state and the SELFREFRESH_REQ_R3 signal is high. Thus, this block governs the self-refresh request by considering the system state and the various enable signals.
