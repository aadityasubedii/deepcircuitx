    "block_comment": "The block of code schedules `dqs_pos_timing_check` procedure to be triggered by a falling edge event on the 27th bit of the `dqs_in` bus. This mechanism is based on the behavior modelling capabilities of Verilog, using the `always` construct to specify triggering of the procedure whenever a desired event occurs. This specific implementation is commonly used in the design and verification of memory interfaces, where timing checks are invoked on the falling edge of the Data Strobe signal to verify successful timing closure."
