    "block_comment": "This code block assigns the value of the `cke_train_reg` register to the `cke_train` wire. In Verilog, the wire is an important entity to transfer the signal from one point to another point inside and between blocks. Here, the `assign` keyword is used to designate a continuous assignment statement, which means it continually drives the `cke_train` wire with the value of `cke_train_reg`. The changes in value of `cke_train_reg` are continually monitored and automatically assigned to `cke_train` wire, contributing to signal propagation.\n"
