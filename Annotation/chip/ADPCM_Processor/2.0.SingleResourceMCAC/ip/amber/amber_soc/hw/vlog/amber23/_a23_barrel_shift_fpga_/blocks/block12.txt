This block of code defines a mask for a least significant bit right (LSR) selector in a hardware logic system. The mask is selected based on the value of the 'lsr_selector'. If `lsr_selector` is a multiple of '1??', the mask is set to '1_0000_0000'. In the case where `lsr_selector` is '01??', the mask is '0_0000_0000'. If '000', a concatenation of '1', a bit swap of 'low_mask', and 'ffff' is used. And for '001', the mask becomes a concatenation of '1_0000' and a bit swap of 'low_mask'. The `casez` statement ensures the code operates correctly even for cases where 'lsr_selector' has some undefined or high-impedance bits.
