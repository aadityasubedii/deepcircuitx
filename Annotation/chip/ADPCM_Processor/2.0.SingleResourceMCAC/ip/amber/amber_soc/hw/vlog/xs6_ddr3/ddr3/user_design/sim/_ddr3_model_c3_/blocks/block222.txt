This function identifies whether an entered address exists in memory or not. It initializes a variable `get_index` to 0 and then traverses the memory from the start to the end using a for loop. If the input address `addr` matches with any saved address in the memory, it sets `get_index` to 1 and exits the loop using `disable index` command, signifying the address is found. Otherwise, `get_index` remains 0, indicating the address does not exist in memory.
