Comment: 
This block of Verilog code updates a register on a rising clock edge under a certain condition. Specifically, if the 'write_hit' signal is true during a rising edge of 'i_clk', the 'data_hit_way_r' register gets updated with the value of 'data_hit_way'. This indicates a write operation to a specific way of a set-associative cache when a write event hits the cache.
