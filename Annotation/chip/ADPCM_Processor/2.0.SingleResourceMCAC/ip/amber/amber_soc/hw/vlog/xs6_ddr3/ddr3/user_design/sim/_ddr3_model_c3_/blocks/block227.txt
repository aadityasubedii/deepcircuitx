The function block acts as a mathematical ceiling operation in Verilog, returning the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the input. The function receives a real number input and checks if it is greater than its integer part, obtained by applying the '$rtoi' system task - if so, one is added to the integer part to reach the next integer number, and this is assigned to the return variable 'ceil'. If the real input is not greater than its integer part, it means it's already an integer and so is directly assigned to 'ceil'.
