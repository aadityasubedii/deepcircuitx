Comment: 
This block of code initiates a timing check on a digital signal. The function, dq_timing_check, is called whenever there is a change to the 10th bit of dq_in, as Verilog indexes start from 0. The timing check function takes the index of the bit as an argument, which in this case is 9, in order to identify which bit to check.
