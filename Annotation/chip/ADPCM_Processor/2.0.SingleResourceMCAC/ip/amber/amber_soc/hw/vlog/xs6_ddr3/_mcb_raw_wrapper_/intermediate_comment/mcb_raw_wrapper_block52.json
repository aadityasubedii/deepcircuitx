    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for assignment operations determined by the C_PORT_ENABLE[3] conditional statement. If the enable signal is active (1'b1), various p3 signals are assigned to their mig_p4 or mig_p5 counterparts. These signals include arb_en, cmd_clk, cmd_en, cmd_ra, cmd_ba, cmd_ca, cmd_instr, cmd_bl, clk, en, wr_data, wr_mask, rd_count, and wr_count. This bridges the interface between the p3 and mig_p4 or mig_p5 systems. If the enable signal is off ('b0), all above-mentioned mig_p4 and mig_p5 signals are assigned low. Independently, the p3_cmd_empty signal is assigned the value of mig_p4_cmd_empty."
