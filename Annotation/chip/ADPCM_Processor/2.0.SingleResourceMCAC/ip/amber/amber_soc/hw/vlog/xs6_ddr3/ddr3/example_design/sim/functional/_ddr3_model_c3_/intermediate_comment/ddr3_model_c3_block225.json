    "block_comment": "The block of code performs the operation of flooring a real number. The implemented function \"floor\" takes an input of a real number. It subsequently checks if the input number is less than the integer form of the same number. If the condition is met, it subtracts 1 from the integer form of the number and assigns the result to the function output \"floor\". If not, it assigns the original number to the output \"floor\". In essence, it truncates the fractional part of the number, rounding down to integer values."
