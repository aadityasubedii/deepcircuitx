    "block_comment": "The given block of code controls the data flow in a Memory Interface Generator (MIG). The implementation is structured on a conditional statement evaluating if the second port (C_PORT_ENABLE[1]) is active: if it's active, it assigns actual values to various MIG port-specific parameters like command clock, command-enable, row address, bank address, column address, command instruction, burst length etc. implying that a task is being executed. In contrast, if the second port is not active, it assigns zero values to the port-specific parameters implying the absence of a task execution."
