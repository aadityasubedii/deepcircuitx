    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for handling write buffer requests upon a positive edge of the input clock ('i_clk'). If a write back ('wb_wait') is occurring, there is no ongoing write buffer operation ('!wbuf_busy_r'), and there is either a core write request or a cache write request, the code will update register values for a write buffer. It saves the input address ('i_address') and the byte enable ('i_byte_enable') to their respective registers and sets the write buffer as busy."
