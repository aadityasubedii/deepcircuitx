    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a labeled sequential block named `START_DYN_CAL`. The primary function of this block is to reset the state of the `Pre_SYSRST` signal. Our code accomplishes this by assigning the boolean value '0' to the `Pre_SYSRST` signal in order to prepare the system for a dynamic calibration process. This is an integral part of system initialization, paving the way for subsequent operations with the system in a known and defined state."
