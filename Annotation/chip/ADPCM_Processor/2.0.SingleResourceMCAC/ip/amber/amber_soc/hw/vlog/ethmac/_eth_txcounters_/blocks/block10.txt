Comment: 
This block represents a clocked always block that manages the count of nibbles (4-bit values). It resets and increments the nibble count based on control signals. On every positive edge of MTxClk or when the Reset signal goes high, the nibble counter, NibCnt, is reset to zero. In normal operation, without reset, if the ResetNibCnt signal is asserted, the count is reset, and if the IncrementNibCnt signal is asserted, the count is incremented by one. The '#Tp' denotes the propagation delay for the operations.
