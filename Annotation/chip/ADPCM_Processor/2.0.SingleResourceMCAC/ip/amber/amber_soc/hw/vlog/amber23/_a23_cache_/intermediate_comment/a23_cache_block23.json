    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code checks if the variable `WAYS` is equal to 4, suggesting the implementation of a multi-way associated cache or similar structure with a set size of four. It then begins a named block, `valid_bits_4ways`. The block's operations would be described within this named block, all tied to the case when `WAYS` is equal to 4. Without the rest of the code, specifics of the operations cannot be made. However, typically, in such context, this block would handle calculating valid bits or similar operations for a cache or data structure with 4 ways. The actual operations will be implemented within this named block, seemingly specific to this `WAYS == 4` case.\n"
