This block of code performs a system check on the memory burst length property and presents a warning if set to unsupported values. It has a conditional check for the variable 'MEM_BURST_LEN'; if it is neither 4 nor 8, the system display will output two statements. One indicates that the current traffic generator logic doesn't support 'On The Fly' (OTF) burst mode, and the other suggests that if the memory is set to OTF, the traffic generator only produces BL8 traffic.
