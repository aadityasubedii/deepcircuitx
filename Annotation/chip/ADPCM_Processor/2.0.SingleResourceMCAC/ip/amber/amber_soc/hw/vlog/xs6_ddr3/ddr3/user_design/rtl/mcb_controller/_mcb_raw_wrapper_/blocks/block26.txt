Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is implementing a 2-bit data-width OSERDES2 Serializer interface, called 'ioi_cas_0'. The serializer's function is to convert parallel data (input on D1 and D2) into serial data (output on OQ). In this implementation, the serializer is operated in a master mode, clocked by 'ioclk0', and reset by 'int_sys_rst'. The device is being used in 1:2 data-rate mode where output data rate is twice the clock rate. Any remaining unused data and shift inputs and outputs are tied off to '0' or '1' as appropriate. The output serial data 'ioi_cas' and output tri-state control 't_cas' are available as results. The TRAIN input is tied to '0', therefore, no dynamic shifting of data at the outputs will occur.
