    "block_comment": "This block implements the I/O interface for a 16-bit wide data bus in a memory controller. It instantiates IODRP2_MCB (I/O Data Rate Provider) modules for each data (DQ) pin, data strobe (DQS) pins, and data mask (DM) pins. The IODRP2_MCB modules handle input/output operations, including delay adjustments and serialization/deserialization. The implementation uses a master-slave configuration for pairs of pins, with separate modules for positive and negative data strobe signals. The block also includes connections for control signals and clocks to manage the I/O operations and delay adjustments."
