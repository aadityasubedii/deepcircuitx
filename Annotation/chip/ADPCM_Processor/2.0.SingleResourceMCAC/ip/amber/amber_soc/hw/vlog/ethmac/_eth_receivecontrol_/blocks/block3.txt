This block is responsible for managing a timer represented by the SlotTimer variable. On each positive edge of either the MRxClk or the RxReset signal, an operation is performed on SlotTimer. The details are handled with three separate conditions: First, if RxReset is high, SlotTimer is reset using a propagation delay of #Tp. Second, if ResetSlotTimer is high, SlotTimer is also reset with the same delay. Lastly, if neither is high but IncrementSlotTimer is, SlotTimer is incremented by 1 with a delay of #Tp.
