    "block_comment": "The block of code is a scheduler that triggers a timing check function whenever there's a change in the 54th bit of the 'dq_in' input data. Implementation-wise, the 'always' keyword in Verilog is used to create a sensitive block that responds to changes in specific signals - in this case, the 54th bit of the 'dq_in' array. The function 'dq_timing_check(53)' is then called each time this bit changes, with the index '53' as a parameter to define the bit position for the function to verify."
