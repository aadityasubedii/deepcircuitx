    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the input and output buffer for the specified types of DDR memory. The code checks if the memory type is DDR, DDR2, or DDR3 and also confirms that the termination calibration is not skipped. If board conditions are satisfied, two major components: IOBUF (to control bidirectional operations) and IODRP2 (used for providing two Data Output paths with resistive and capacitive components) are generated. This enables handling unique I/O operations of DDR memory types effectively."
