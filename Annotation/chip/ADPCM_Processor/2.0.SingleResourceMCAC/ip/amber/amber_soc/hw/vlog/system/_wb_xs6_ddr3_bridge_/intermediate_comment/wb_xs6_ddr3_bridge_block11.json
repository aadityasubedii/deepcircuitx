    "block_comment": "This block of code is for a condition checking in a 'generate' block for width-based configuration in a Write-Back (WB) stage of a pipeline. It's checking whether the data width (DWIDTH) of the WB stage is equal to 32. If the condition is true (i.e., DWIDTH equals 32), the instantiated logic in the attached context labelled `wb32w`, which is typically found below this block of code, will be generated for this specific configuration. This provides a mechanism for hardware parameterization, allowing the creation of multiple instances with different internal configurations, based on the data width, which allows for a flexible and reusable design."
