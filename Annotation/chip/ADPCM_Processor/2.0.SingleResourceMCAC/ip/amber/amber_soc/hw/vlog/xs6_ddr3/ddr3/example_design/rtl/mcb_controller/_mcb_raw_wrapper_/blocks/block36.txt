This block of code controls the operation of the cke_train_reg in different situations. On the rising edge of either ui_clk or int_sys_rst, the cke_train_reg is reset if int_sys_rst is active. Otherwise, the cke_train_reg is set if wait_200us_done_r1 condition is met and wait_200us_done_r2 is not met. If these conditions are not met and uo_done_cal is active, the cke_train_reg is reset again.
