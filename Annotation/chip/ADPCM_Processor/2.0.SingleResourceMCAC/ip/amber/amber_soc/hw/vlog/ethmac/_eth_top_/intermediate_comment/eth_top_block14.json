    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a wire named 'Collision'. It implements a bitwise AND operation between the bitwise negation of 'r_FullD' and 'Collision_Tx2'.  Primarily, the block detects a signal collision condition. It does so by creating a condition where both 'r_FullD' is false (0), i.e., the system is not fully dominated, and a previous collision was detected on Transmission 2 ('Collision_Tx2' is true). If both these conditions satisfy, the 'Collision' wire becomes active indicating a current signal collision."
