    "block_comment": "This block of code, in the context of a larger digital system, is used for synchronizing the signal 'upper_end_matched' with the rising edge of the input clock 'clk_i'. Upon each rising edge of 'clk_i', if the reset signal 'rst_i' is asserted, 'upper_end_matched' is reset to 0. If 'rst_i' is not asserted and 'mcb_cmd_en_i' is enabled, 'upper_end_matched' is assigned the result of the logical AND operation on the signals 'AC3_G_E3', 'AC2_G_E2', and 'AC1_G_E1'."
