    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is involved in assigning values related to wishbone interface and interfacing with a specific slave. The 'wb_adr', 'wb_dat', and 'wb_sel' values from the master are simply passed on. For 'wb_we', 'wb_cyc', and 'wb_stb', these signals are activated only if the 'current_slave' is 1, indicating that the slave with ID 1 is currently being addressed. Otherwise, these signals are deactivated."
