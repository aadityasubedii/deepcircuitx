This block sets up a soft calibration module in memory controller block, only when the `C_CALIB_SOFT_IP` constant is set to "TRUE". The module, `mcb_soft_calibration_top`, is initialized with a combination of constants and control signals, enabling flexibility in memory operation. It majorly interacts with user interface, facilitating the memory related operations like self-refresh requests, done signals for calibration and command enabling. Internal system reset (`int_sys_rst`) signal is fed in for resetting the module. The assignments are primarily used for communication between the memory controller block and the user interface. The generate-endgenerate block conditions the application of this calibration block.
