    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a serializer for transmitting information packets. It monitors the conditions under which a data retry packet becomes blocked. Upon receiving a positive edge clock signal or reset trigger, the serializer sets the TxRetryPacketBlocked variable to zero, marking that a retry transmission attempt is cleared in case of resetting or when the TxRetry_wb is deasserted while TxRetry_wb_q is asserted. However, when a retry packet (TxRetryPacket) is present, it sets TxRetryPacketBlocked to one, indicating that the retry packet is currently being processed, hence blocking new transmissions."
