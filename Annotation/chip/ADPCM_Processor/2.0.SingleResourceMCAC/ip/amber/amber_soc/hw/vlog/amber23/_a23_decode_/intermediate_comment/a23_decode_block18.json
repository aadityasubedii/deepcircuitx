    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is used to handle the abort scenario of a particular control state (`MTRANS5_ABORT`). If the control state matches the `MTRANS5_ABORT` condition, the block then checks whether a `restore_base_address` condition is met. If `restore_base_address` is True, then `reg_write_sel_nxt` is set to `3'd6` (binary value 6 represented as a 3 bit number) and `reg_bank_wsel_nxt` is set to a certain 4 bit slice (`[19:16]`) of the `instruction`."
