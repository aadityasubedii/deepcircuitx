Comment: 
This block of code writes data into a read buffer after a cache miss. Based on various conditions on the addressing bitmask miss_address[3:2], different segments of the burst of incoming writeback data (wb_rdata_burst) are selected and concatenated to form the write-data for the read buffer (read_miss_wdata). If the bitmask is '00', the full block of writeback data is written. For '01', the first 96 bits and the bits from position 127 to 96 are concatenated. For '10', the first 64 bits and the bits from 127 to 64 are concatenated. If the bitmask is any other value, the first 32 bits and the bits from 127 to 32 are concatenated.
