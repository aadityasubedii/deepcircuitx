    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is for controlling the read enable signal, rd_en. Depending on the logic family (SPARTAN6 or others) and the Memory Burst Length, different sets of conditions are considered for generating the rd_en signal. If the logic family is SPARTAN6, rd_en will be high only when gen_rdy_i is high and the FIFO is not empty. For others, if their memory burst length equals 4, rd_en is high for certain conditions including not-empty FIFO and not-empty read data FIFO, or during certain data validation and user block count stages. If the memory burst length is not equal to 4, the rd_en will be high during data validation stages or when the user block count is not 1."
