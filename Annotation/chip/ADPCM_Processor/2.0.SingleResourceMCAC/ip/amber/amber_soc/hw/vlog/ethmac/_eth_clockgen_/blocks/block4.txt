Comment: 
The block described aims to control a flip-flop, Mdc, that toggles its state under specific conditions. Following the rising edge of a system clock or a reset signal, the flip-flop is affected. If a reset condition is detected, the flip-flop is set to a low state, '0'. In contrast, when a specific condition denoted as CountEq0 is met, the flip-flop toggles its state. This is achieved using the bitwise NOT operator (~) combined with the current state of Mdc itself to toggle between '0' and '1'.
