    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code generates a specific data pattern under certain configurations of the DQ pins and the chosen data pattern. The block activates when the number of DQ pins is 56 (`NUM_DQ_PINS == 56`) and the selected data pattern is \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\" or \"DGEN_ALL\". This condition sets up the label `WALKING_ONE_56_PATTERN`. The condition is checked with every positive clock edge (`always @ (posedge clk_i)`), ensuring that the data pattern changes dynamically alongside the module operation."
