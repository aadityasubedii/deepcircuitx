The block configures and interfaces with an AXI bus acting as an user interface. It sets AXI arbitration enable and address signals with bitwise operations. Additionally, it includes an instance of the 'mcb_ui_top_synch' module to synchronously signal when memory calibration is complete. A main sub-module 'axi_mcb' is instantiated for managing the connection with the AXI bus, providing a wide range of parameters that define operation details such as data width, addressing capabilities, and read/write support. The module is also connected to multiple status and control lines, effectively binding lower level MCB operations with higher level AXI operations.
