    "module": "Module-level comment: The a23_core module is a pivotal component in a complex digital design that mimics a processor. It manages instruction fetch, decode, execute and coprocessor interactions. This is achieved through numerous internal and interfacing signals governing data operations, register selection, status controls, interrupt management, and more. Key blocks (a23_fetch, a23_decode, a23_execute, a23_coprocessor) execute specific tasks using these signals, coordinating to realize higher-level functionalities.\n"
