Comment: 
The block of code is tasked with defining a state machine for the Wishbone Protocol. The Wishbone protocol is employed to facilitate data communication between different modules in a hardware design. This is implemented using a wire called `xAS_STATE` that holds the state declaration of the Wishbone protocol. It assigns different states depending on the condition of `wishbone_st`, which could either be WB_IDLE, WB_BURST1, WB_BURST2, WB_BURST3, or WB_WAIT_ACK. If the `wishbone_st` does not match any of these known states, then it is assigned a default state of "UNKNOWN".
