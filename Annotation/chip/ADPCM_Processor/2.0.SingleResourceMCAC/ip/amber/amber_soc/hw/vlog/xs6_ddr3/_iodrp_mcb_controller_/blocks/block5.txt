Comment: 
This block implements a sequential logic circuit to control DRAM register programming (DRP) and memory controller block (MCB) signals based on certain state conditions. Upon every positive edge of DRP_CLK, the block updates DRP_ADD and DRP_CS to signify either an address or a data phase. MCB_UIREAD is enabled when the system enters a read operation in the data phase. Furthermore, when the system is ready, the DRP_BKST receives data through a broadcast mechanism if "use_broadcast" is activated.
