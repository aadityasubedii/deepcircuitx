The given code block determines the On/Off status of a wait count, controlled by the signal `WaitCountEnable`. The `WaitCountEnable` signal is updated asynchronously on the positive edge of the user clock (`UI_CLK`). The default, following reset (`RST`), disables the wait count (`WaitCountEnable` is set to 0). `WaitCountEnable` is also reset when there is no current self-refresh request, but one has been registered previously (`SELFREFRESH_REQ_R2` is negated and `SELFREFRESH_REQ_R1` is true). Conversely, the wait count is enabled (`WaitCountEnable` set to 1) if there is ancillary condition of not currently performing the start of dynamic calibration after self-refresh and such a condition was registered in the previous state (`PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH` is false and `PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH_R1` is true). Otherwise, the `WaitCountEnable` signal's value remains unchanged.
