Comment: 
This block of Verilog code defines three parameters for representing different bank and group conditions. `SAME_BANK` is designated as a 2-bit binary value of '00', `DIFF_BANK` is designated as a `2'd1` or a 2-bit binary value of '01', and `DIFF_GROUP` represents a different group condition designated as a `2'd2`, or a 2-bit binary value of '10'. These are constants being defined for future use, to identify the conditions of data belonging to the same bank, a different bank, or a different group in a memory organization or memory-related operation.
