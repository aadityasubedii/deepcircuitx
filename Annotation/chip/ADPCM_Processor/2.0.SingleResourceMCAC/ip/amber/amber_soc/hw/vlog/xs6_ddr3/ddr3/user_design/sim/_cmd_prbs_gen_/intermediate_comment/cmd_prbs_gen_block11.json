    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is functionally a LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) that generates pseudorandom bit sequences. The operation depends on the input signals. When 'prbs_seed_init' is asserted, it initializes the LFSR with an input seed ('prbs_seed_i'). Otherwise, in every rising edge of the enabled clock ('clk_i' when 'clk_en' is asserted), it performs bit-wise shift and XOR operations to update the values in the LFSR ('lfsr_q'), which creates a pseudorandom bit sequence output."
