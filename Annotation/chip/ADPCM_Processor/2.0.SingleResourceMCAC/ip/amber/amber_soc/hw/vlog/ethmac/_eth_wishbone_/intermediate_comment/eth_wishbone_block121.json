    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is used to clear the Transmit FIFO buffer. If either the transmit packet is aborted or a packet is flagged for retry, the Transmit FIFO buffer is cleared. This is achieved through the use of the logical OR operator, which sets TxFifoClear to true (1) if either TxAbortPacket or TxRetryPacket is true (1)."
