Comment: 
This block is responsible for triggering the DQS (Data Strobe) negative edge timing check on the 8th (index starts from 0) DQS line. This implementation is event-driven, meaning the timing check function `dqs_neg_timing_check` is invoked specifically whenever a negative edge is detected on the 7th index of `dqs_in` signal. This mechanism helps in maintaining the synchronization between data and the strobe signal effectively.
