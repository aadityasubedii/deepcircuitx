Comment: 
The Verilog block defines the function 'pick_way' which selects a way or path based on input 'valid_bits' and 'random_num'. In the implementation, if any bit in the valid_bits is zero, 'pick_way' is assigned the 4-bit binary equivalent of that bit index. If all bits are 1, then the function resorts to a case selection of 'pick_way' based on the value of the upper three bits of 'random_num'.
