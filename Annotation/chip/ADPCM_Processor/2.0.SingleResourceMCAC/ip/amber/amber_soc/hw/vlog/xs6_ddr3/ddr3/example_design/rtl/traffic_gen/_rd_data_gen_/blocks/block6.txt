Comment: 
This line of code assigns the signal 'cmd_rdy' to the output wire 'cmd_rdy_o'. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog indicates that 'cmd_rdy_o' will always take the value of 'cmd_rdy' as long as the latter is defined. This provides a continuous assignment link between 'cmd_rdy' and 'cmd_rdy_o' wire giving the ability to pass and update the 'cmd_rdy' signal to the outer module or logic blocks that are connected to 'cmd_rdy_o'.
