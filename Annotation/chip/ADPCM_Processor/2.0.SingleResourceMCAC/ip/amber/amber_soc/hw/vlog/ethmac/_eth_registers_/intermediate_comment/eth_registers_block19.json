    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a synchronous reset mechanism for a signal named ResetTxCIrq_sync1, which is active on positive edges of a signal called TxClk or Reset. More specifically, when there's a high input on the Reset signal, it immediately clears the ResetTxCIrq_sync1 signal. In the absence of a Reset signal, the value of ResetTxCIrq_sync1 gets updated with the value of SetTxCIrq_sync2 at the next positive edge of TxClk signal. The propagation delay, Tp, is used to model the delay characteristics of actual hardware."
