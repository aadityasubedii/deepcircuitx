The block of Verilog code functuions as a monitor that triggers a timing check specified by 'cmd_addr_timing_check(15)' whenever a change is detected on the 9th bit of 'addr_in'. This monitor is implemented using an 'always' block which is sensitive to changes at 'addr_in[8]'. Thus, whenever there is a transition (either 0 to 1, or 1 to 0) on the 9th bit of the 'addr_in' port, the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function gets called with an argument of '15' i.e., 15 clock cycles. This function will typically perform some kind of timing verification process related to the address command.
