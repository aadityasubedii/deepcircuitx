This block is a counter reset and increment implementation. On the rising edge of MRxClk or Reset, the reset functionality is given the utmost priority - if Reset is high, the counter (IFGCounter) is reset to initial value "0". In the absence of Reset, if ResetIFGCounter is high, then IFGCounter is reset to "0". However, if IncrementIFGCounter is high with Reset and ResetIFGCounter being low, IFGCounter is incremented by 1.
