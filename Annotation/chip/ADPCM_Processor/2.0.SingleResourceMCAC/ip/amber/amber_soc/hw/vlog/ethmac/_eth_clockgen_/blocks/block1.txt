This block of code represents a logic assignment in a digital system. The statement assigns a new binary value to the signal MdcEn_n, it is realized as an AND operation between CountEq0 and Mdc signals. Whenever CountEq0 equals to 1 (high signal) and Mdc is high too, MdcEn_n will be set to 1, otherwise it will be 0. It is commonly used to enable or disable certain parts of a larger system based on specific conditions (CountEq0 and Mdc in this case). It's a high-level conditional logic mechanism.
