    "block_comment": "This block checks for invalid commands being issued to a write-only port 5 in a system. It monitors the configuration port (C_PORT_CONFIG) for a particular setting (\"W32\"), checks if the command enable (p5_cmd_en) is activated, and evaluates specific bits (bit 2 and bit 0) of the instruction command (p5_cmd_instr). If these conditions are met, representing an invalid command, the system displays an error message and halts."
