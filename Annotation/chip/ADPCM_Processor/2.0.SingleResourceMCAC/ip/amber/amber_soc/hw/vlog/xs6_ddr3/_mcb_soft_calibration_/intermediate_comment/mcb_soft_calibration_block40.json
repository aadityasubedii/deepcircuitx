    "block_comment": "This block of code writes the N_Term data to the IODRP controller's memory cell. The program sets the Active_IODRP variable to ZIO, enables the valid command bit (IODRPCTRLR_CMD_VALID), sets the memory cell address to NTerm, and then writes data to the memory cell, packaged with a write flag (WRITE_MODE) to specify the operation mode. After this, the program checks if the IODRP controller is ready. If it isn't ready yet, the STATE variable remains unchanged. Otherwise, it transitions to the next state (WAIT4)."
