    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the broadcasting state. It is implemented as a synchronous process that is sensitive to the rising edge of MRxClk or Reset signal. When a reset condition is active, the broadcast signal is de-asserted. Otherwise, the broadcast state is determined by the conditions of other signals: StateData[0], LatchedByte[7:0], ByteCntSmall7, ByteCntEq1, RxAbort, and RxEndFrm. The broadcast is de-asserted on multiple conditions: when StateData[0] is true and either LatchedByte[7:0] is false or ByteCntSmall7 is true, or when RxAbort or RxEndFrm is true. Alternatively, the broadcast is asserted when StateData[0] is true, LatchedByte[7:0] is true, and ByteCntEq1 is true."
