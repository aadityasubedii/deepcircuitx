Module-level comment: 

// Module: data_prbs_gen. A pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) generator using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). Takes clock, clock enable, reset and initial/forced seeds as inputs; produces PRBS as output. PRBS seed values are either directly initialized with seed inputs or calculated using feedback and shift operations on the LFSR jumpstart the PRBS generation. The generated PRBS sequence is updated in response to changes in the LFSR and presented at the output.
