    "block_comment": "The block of code runs an interrupt assignment function, asserting an 'interrupt' signal under specific conditions. It implements logic to trigger the 'interrupt' if the value of 'next_interrupt' is neither 0 nor 7 nor 6 and there is no conflict, as determined by the 'conflict' signal being false. Consequently, 'interrupt' will be asserted when the 'next_interrupt' signal holds certain values and there's no 'conflict'."
