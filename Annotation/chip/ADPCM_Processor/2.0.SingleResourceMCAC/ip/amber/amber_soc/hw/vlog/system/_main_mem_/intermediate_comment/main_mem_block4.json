    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is a data read operation from a RAM (Random Access Memory) block. The data read from the RAM is assigned to 'rd_data'. The source address from which the data is read is specified by the decimal equivalent of the 26th through 2nd bits of 'addr_d1'. The right portion of 'addr_d1' in the square brackets, '[27:2]', is an index to an array that selects a subset of 'addr_d1'. The single line code is an example of an asynchronous read operation in Verilog that doesn't require a clock signal."
