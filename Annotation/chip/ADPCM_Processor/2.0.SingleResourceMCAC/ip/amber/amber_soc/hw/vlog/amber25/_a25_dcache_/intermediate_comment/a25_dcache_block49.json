    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for executing a read hit operation on the cache memory. It works by constantly monitoring `i_clk` for a positive edge. When a positive edge in `i_clk` is present and `ex_read_hit` is asserted (meaning the processor has made a read request and the data is found in the cache), the relevant address `i_address` is selected and stored into `ex_read_address`. The selection is done by extracting the bit slice from `CACHE_ADDR32_MSB` (Most Significant Bit) to `CACHE_ADDR32_LSB` (Least Significant Bit) inclusive."
