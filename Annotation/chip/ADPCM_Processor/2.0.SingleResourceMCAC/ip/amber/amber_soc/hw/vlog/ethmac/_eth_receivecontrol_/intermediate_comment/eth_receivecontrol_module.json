    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'eth_receivecontrol' module acts as a controller for Ethernet data reception. It validates received frames, identifies pause frames, handles pause timing, and manages flow control. This is achieved by processing signals for data validity, frame reception, flow status, MAC address, and CRC delay. The core functionalities are implemented through a series of procedural blocks that analyze the incoming data, compare addresses, operate timers, and manage the pause condition. The design complies with Ethernet standards for efficient data transmission."
