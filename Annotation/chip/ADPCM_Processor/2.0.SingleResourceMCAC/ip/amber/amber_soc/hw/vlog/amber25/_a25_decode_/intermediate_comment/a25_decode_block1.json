    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a diagnostic check for the execution of instructions within a control state. On every rising edge of the clock signal (i_clk), if the system is in the EXECUTE control state and the first or last bit of the instruction is undefined (`1'bx`), an error message is displayed. The error message logs the exact instruction that resulted in the error, helping in the troubleshooting process."
