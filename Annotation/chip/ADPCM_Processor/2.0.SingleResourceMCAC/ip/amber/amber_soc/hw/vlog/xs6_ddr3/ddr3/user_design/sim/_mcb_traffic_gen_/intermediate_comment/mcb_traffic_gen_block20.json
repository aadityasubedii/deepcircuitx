    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the read operation of a Command FIFO (First In, First Out) memory element. The read operation, indicated by `cmd_fifo_rd`, is enabled (`mcb_cmd_en_o`) only when the Command FIFO is not full (`~mcb_cmd_full_i`) and not empty (`~cmd_fifo_empty`). Active low logic is used to check the full and empty status of the FIFO."
