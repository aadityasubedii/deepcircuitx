This block generates clock and control signals for the Spartan6 MCB (Memory Controller Block) interface. If the external BUFPLL (buffered phase-locked loop) is not employed (C_MCB_USE_EXTERNAL_BUFPLL == 0), the internal BUFPLL_MCB is instantiated with division factor of 2 and locked to '0'. It provides two clock outputs (ioclk0 and ioclk180), a global clock (ui_clk), and handles the LOCK and SERDESSTROBE signals. If the external BUFPLL is employed, the ioclk, pll_ce, and pll_lock signals are directly assigned to their corresponding inputs without any modification.
