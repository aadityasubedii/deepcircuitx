    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to continuously monitor a specific event or changes in the system, precisely the `cs_n_in` input condition. Once there's a change in `cs_n_in`, it invokes the `cmd_addr_timing_check(0)` procedure. This implementation ensures that it can perform a timing verification check whenever there's adjustment in the `cs_n_in` signal, enhancing the system's reliability and consistency."
