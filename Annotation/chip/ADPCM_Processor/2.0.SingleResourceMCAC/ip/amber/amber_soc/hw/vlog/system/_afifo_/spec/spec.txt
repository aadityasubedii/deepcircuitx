Module name: afifo. 

Module specification: The 'afifo' module is an implementation of an asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) design for memory management. The module operates under asynchronous conditions where write and read operations are controlled by separate clock signals. 

Input ports of the module include "wr_clk" (write clock), "rd_clk" (read clock), "i_data" (input data), "i_push" (write enable signal), "i_pop" (read enable signal). The "wr_clk" and "rd_clk" control the timing for write and read operations respectively while "i_data" is the input data that gets stored into the FIFO. The signals "i_push" and "i_pop", when high, enable the FIFO to accept incoming data or read the output data if FIFO is not full or empty, respectively. 

The output of the module is given through "o_data" (output data), "o_full", and "o_empty". "o_data" carries the data read from the FIFO. The signals "o_full" and "o_empty" serve as status flags indicating whether the FIFO is full or empty, respectively.

The internal signals include the write and read pointers ("wr_pointer" and "rd_pointer"), their delayed versions for synchronization ("wr_pointer_d1", "rd_pointer_d1", "wr_pointer_d2", and "rd_pointer_d2"), and their Gray code decoded versions ("wr_pointer_rd", "rd_pointer_wr") along with the FIFO buffer represented as a 'data' array. The pointers are used to index the next write or read positions in the FIFO. The Gray code versions and their delays are used for synchronization across different clock domains. 

The code is organized into sections that handle write/read operations (updating pointers and data array), synchronization (using Gray code conversion for pointers), and status updates. A pair of functions ("gray8" and "ungray8") is used for Gray code conversions. Overall, 'afifo' serves as a fundamental structure for memory organization, especially in managing data flow within the hardware design.
