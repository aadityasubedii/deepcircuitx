    "module": "Module-level comment: The cmd_prbs_gen module builds Pseudo-Random Binary Sequences (PRBS) for communication circuit testing, parameterized by command type, PRBS and seed width. It makes use of multiple generate-if blocks corresponding to different conditions for the command, with distinct linear feedback shift register configurations. The input ports control module operation and supply the initial seed value; the output port delivers the generated PRBS. Internal signals maintain the PRBS and control generation logic."
