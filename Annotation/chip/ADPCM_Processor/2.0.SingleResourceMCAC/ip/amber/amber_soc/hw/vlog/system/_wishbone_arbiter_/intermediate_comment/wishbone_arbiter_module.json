    "module": "Module-level comment: The wishbone_arbiter is an SoC module that manages data transfer between two master and eight slave ports on a wishbone bus. It employs hold registers ('m0_wb_hold_r', 'm1_wb_hold_r') to decide which master can access the bus, based on simultaneous requests. The current slave to process a request is determined with the 'master_adr'. Input and output ports facilitate the receipt and sending of signals and data, while several internal signals act as control level logic for the request-grant arbitration and to store signal data state. The Verilog code includes port declarations, internal signal declarations, logic blocks, and assignments facilitating control decisions and data transfers."
