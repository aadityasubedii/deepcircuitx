    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is primarily designed for control of instruction execution and modification of status bits based on varying conditions. It starts monitoring when the control state is in COPRO_WAIT and an instruction is being executed. If the 20th bit of the instruction is set, it then further checks the 12th to 15th bits. If these equal 15, it sets specific status bits and modifies them based on the current mode of the i_execute_status_bits. If those bits are not equals to 15, the reg_bank_wsel_nxt is set based on 12th to 15th bits of the instruction. In case the 20th bit of the instruction is not set, it proceeds to set the copro_operation_nxt to 2. Throughout this process, a pre_fetch_instruction is enabled at the start of the block."
