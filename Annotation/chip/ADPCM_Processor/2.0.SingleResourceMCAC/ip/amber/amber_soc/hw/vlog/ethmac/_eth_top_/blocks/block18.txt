Comment: 
The `eth_rxethmac` block is a receiver circuit for an Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) module. The module latches incoming Ethernet data packets, checks validity and CRC, and outputs the received data. Internally, it consists of state machines for monitoring packet reception (like checking for idle, preamble, and data states). It checks for MAC addresses in the packet, using registered HASH values, to prevent reception of inappropriate packets. Frame size is also noted and tracked, aligning with user-configurable parameters. The block raises signals on receiving start and end of a frame and indicates the validity of the received frame along with whether any CRC error was encountered.
