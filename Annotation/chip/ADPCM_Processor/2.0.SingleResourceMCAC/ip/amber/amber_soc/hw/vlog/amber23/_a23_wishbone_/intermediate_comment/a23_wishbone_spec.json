    "spec": "Module name: a23_wishbone. \n\nModule specification: The a23_wishbone module is an essential interface for the wishbone interconnect standard, managing various requests like read, write, and cache-oriented operations. It operates according to the protocols defined by the wishbone standards and maintains a state machine to handle different situations effectively.\n\nThe module takes 12 inputs: `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_select` (control signal to enable the module), `i_write_data` (write data signal), `i_write_enable` (write control signal), `i_byte_enable` (byte enable signal), `i_data_access` (data access signal), `i_exclusive` (exclusive access signal), `i_address` (address signal), `i_cache_req` (cache request signal), `i_wb_dat` (wishbone read data signal), `i_wb_ack` (wishbone acknowledge signal), and `i_wb_err` (wishbone error signal).\n\nIt outputs 7 signals: `o_stall` (stall signal), `o_wb_adr` (wishbone address signal), `o_wb_sel` (wishbone select signal), `o_wb_we` (wishbone write enable signal), `o_wb_dat` (wishbone write data signal), `o_wb_cyc` (wishbone cycle signal), `o_wb_stb` (wishbone strobe signal).\n\nInternally, it uses several signals such as `wishbone_st` (wishbone state), `core_read_request`, `core_write_request`, `cache_read_request`, `cache_write_request`, `start_access`, `servicing_cache`, `byte_enable`, `exclusive_access`, `read_ack`, `wait_write_ack`, `wb_wait`, `wbuf_addr_r`, `wbuf_sel_r`, `wbuf_busy_r`, and `xAS_STATE`.\n\nThe module is composed of distinct logic blocks or sections, like data transfer protocol management, control and data signal assignments, state transition management via a switch-case structure defining the operation sequence, and debugging display management.\n\nBy handling control signals, managing wishbone protocol stages, and dealing with various request types, this module ensures proper data read, write, and cache operations conforming to the wishbone standard, thus playing a vital role in the overall system's data handling mechanism. It preserves the wishbone system's reliability and flexibility, ensuring smooth data communication between different hardware components.",

It operates according to the protocols defined by the wishbone standards and maintains a state machine to handle different situations effectively.\n\nThe module takes 12 inputs: `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_select` (control signal to enable the module), `i_write_data` (write data signal), `i_write_enable` (write control signal), `i_byte_enable` (byte enable signal), `i_data_access` (data access signal), `i_exclusive` (exclusive access signal), `i_address` (address signal), `i_cache_req` (cache request signal), `i_wb_dat` (wishbone read data signal), `i_wb_ack` (wishbone acknowledge signal), and `i_wb_err` (wishbone error signal).\n\nIt outputs 7 signals: `o_stall` (stall signal), `o_wb_adr` (wishbone address signal), `o_wb_sel` (wishbone select signal), `o_wb_we` (wishbone write enable signal), `o_wb_dat` (wishbone write data signal), `o_wb_cyc` (wishbone cycle signal), `o_wb_stb` (wishbone strobe signal).\n\nInternally, it uses several signals such as `wishbone_st` (wishbone state), `core_read_request`, `core_write_request`, `cache_read_request`, `cache_write_request`, `start_access`, `servicing_cache`, `byte_enable`, `exclusive_access`, `read_ack`, `wait_write_ack`, `wb_wait`, `wbuf_addr_r`, `wbuf_sel_r`, `wbuf_busy_r`, and `xAS_STATE`.\n\nThe module is composed of distinct logic blocks or sections, like data transfer protocol management, control and data signal assignments, state transition management via a switch-case structure defining the operation sequence, and debugging display management.\n\nBy handling control signals, managing wishbone protocol stages, and dealing with various request types, this module ensures proper data read, write, and cache operations conforming to the wishbone standard, thus playing a vital role in the overall system's data handling mechanism. It preserves the wishbone system's reliability and flexibility, ensuring smooth data communication between different hardware components."

It operates according to the protocols defined by the wishbone standards and maintains a state machine to handle different situations effectively.\n\nThe module takes 12 inputs: `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_select` (control signal to enable the module), `i_write_data` (write data signal), `i_write_enable` (write control signal), `i_byte_enable` (byte enable signal), `i_data_access` (data access signal), `i_exclusive` (exclusive access signal), `i_address` (address signal), `i_cache_req` (cache request signal), `i_wb_dat` (wishbone read data signal), `i_wb_ack` (wishbone acknowledge signal), and `i_wb_err` (wishbone error signal).\n\nIt outputs 7 signals: `o_stall` (stall signal), `o_wb_adr` (wishbone address signal), `o_wb_sel` (wishbone select signal), `o_wb_we` (wishbone write enable signal), `o_wb_dat` (wishbone write data signal), `o_wb_cyc` (wishbone cycle signal), `o_wb_stb` (wishbone strobe signal).\n\nInternally, it uses several signals such as `wishbone_st` (wishbone state), `core_read_request`, `core_write_request`, `cache_read_request`, `cache_write_request`, `start_access`, `servicing_cache`, `byte_enable`, `exclusive_access`, `read_ack`, `wait_write_ack`, `wb_wait`, `wbuf_addr_r`, `wbuf_sel_r`, `wbuf_busy_r`, and `xAS_STATE`.\n\nThe module is composed of distinct logic blocks or sections, like data transfer protocol management, control and data signal assignments, state transition management via a switch-case structure defining the operation sequence, and debugging display management.\n\nBy handling control signals, managing wishbone protocol stages, and dealing with various request types, this module ensures proper data read, write, and cache operations conforming to the wishbone standard, thus playing a vital role in the overall system's data handling mechanism. It preserves the wishbone system's reliability and flexibility, ensuring smooth data communication between different hardware components."
