This block of code serves as a monitoring mechanism for data cache behavior in a system. Once triggered by a leading clock edge (i_clk kindles the process), it checks whether the sum of 'data_hit_way' indices [0] and [1] surpasses one. If this condition is met, it suggests more than one cache ways have been engaged simultaneously. This scenario is seen as an anomaly and should not occur under normal circumstances. Hence, this situation triggers a response in which an Error Macro (`TB_ERROR_MESSAGE) is deployed, and a diagnostic message ("Hit in more than one cache ways!") is displayed to notify about the aberration. This block thus ensures the proper single cache way access in the system.
