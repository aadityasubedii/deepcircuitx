This block of code manages hardware-software interaction when calibration is not enabled in a Memory Controller Block (MCB) module. A multitude of signals are assigned from the user interface (ui) to the memory controller block (mcb), enabling external control of the MCB. Additionally, it provides control mechanisms for system reset and for initializing a sequence. If calibration is not enabled (`C_CALIB_SOFT_IP != "TRUE"`), the `DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL` is forced to logic 0. The system reset (`MCB_SYSRST`) is designed to trigger when the internal system reset (`int_sys_rst`) is active or the 16-bit wait counter reaches 200 microseconds. Also, `selfrefresh_mode` is enforced to logic 0 in this condition. The block initiates an init_sequence if the simulation is not active, allowing for further hardware operating sequences.
