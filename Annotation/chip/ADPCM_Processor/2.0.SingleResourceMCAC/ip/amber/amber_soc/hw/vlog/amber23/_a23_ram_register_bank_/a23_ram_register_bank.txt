Module-level comment: 

The 'a23_ram_register_bank' is a CPU register control unit performing read and write operations using input-output ports and internal signals. With functionalities provided by execution, immediate decode and read status modes, address selectors, and status bits, it manipulates a set of register memory arrays and a special status register. Through a set of 'always' and continuous assignments, execution modes are maintained, register addresses are updated, and appropriate output data are selected. Its core function is showcased in a function to compute register addresses depending on modes and selectors.
