The block of code generates a specific data pattern based on the number of Data Query (DQ) pins and the defined data pattern. When the number of DQ pins is 88 and the data pattern is either "DGEN_NEIGHBOR", "DGEN_WALKING1", "DGEN_WALKING0", or "DGEN_ALL", the block creates a "WALKING_ONE_88_PATTERN". This is achieved by constantly checking the positive edge of the clock input.
