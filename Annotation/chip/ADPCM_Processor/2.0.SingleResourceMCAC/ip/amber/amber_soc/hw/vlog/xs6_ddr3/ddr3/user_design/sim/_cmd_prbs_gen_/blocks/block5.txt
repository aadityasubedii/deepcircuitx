Comment: 
The provided Verilog block generates a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) based on the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) and checks it against two different masks: PRBS_SADDR_MASK_POS and PRBS_EADDR_MASK_POS. If it matches the PRBS_SADDR_MASK_POS mask, it performs a bitwise OR operation with PRBS_SADDR and the next value in the LFSR. Similarly for PRBS_EADDR_MASK_POS, it performs a bitwise AND operation with PRBS_EADDR and the LFSR. The code caters differently for the SPARTAN6 family and others where the initial index i for the for loop and the width for the initialization of prbs varies. After each cycle, the PRBS is reset based on the value of the width DWIDTH. The PRBS generated is stored in the same width as the lfsr_q array and changed on every change in lfsr_q.
