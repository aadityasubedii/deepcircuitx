Comment: 
The function of this block is to invoke the `dqs_neg_timing_check()` function every time the 27th bit of the `dqs_in` signal transitions from a low to high state (posedge). Given that this block is placed within an `always` statement, it means that this function will perpetually monitor the 27th bit of `dqs_in`. This logic is implemented using the `always @(posedge dqs_in[26])` Verilog command, which essentially looks for a positive edge trigger on the 27th bit (indexed from 0) of the `dqs_in` signal to execute `dqs_neg_timing_check()` function.
