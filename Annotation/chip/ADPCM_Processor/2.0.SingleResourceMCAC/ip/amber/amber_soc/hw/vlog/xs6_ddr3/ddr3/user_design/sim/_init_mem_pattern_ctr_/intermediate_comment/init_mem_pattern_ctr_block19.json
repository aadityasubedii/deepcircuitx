    "block_comment": "The block of code is designed to update the signal 'upper_end_matched' based on the control signals, 'rst_i' and 'mcb_cmd_en_i'. This block works synchronously with a clock signal (clk_i), and hence is executed at every positive edge of the clock. On receiving a 'rst_i' signal, the 'upper_end_matched' signal is reset to '0'. However, if 'mcb_cmd_en_i' is active and 'rst_i' is inactive, the 'upper_end_matched' is updated with the result of an AND operation between three other signals 'AC3_G_E3', 'AC2_G_E2' & 'AC1_G_E1'. Thus, the output, 'upper_end_matched', indicates whether all signals at the upper end are matched or not, depending on the control signals ('rst_i' and 'mcb_cmd_en_i') and input signals ('AC3_G_E3', 'AC2_G_E2' & 'AC1_G_E1')."
