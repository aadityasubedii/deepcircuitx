    "block_comment": "The block of code primarily handles the state transitions of a memory controller broadcast system within a complex hardware design. It dictates how and when the system transitions between different states. The code sets the `Pre_SYSRST` to zero and assigns the value of `MCB_PORT` to `Active_IODRP`. Then, upon meeting a certain condition (both `START_BROADCAST` being true and `IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N` being true), the system updates its state: it checks if either `P_Term` has changed from `P_Term_Prev` or `SKIP_IN_TERM_CAL` is true, and if so, switches the `STATE` to `BROADCAST_PTERM` and updates `P_Term_Prev`. If not, the system checks if `N_Term` has changed from `N_Term_Prev`, updating `N_Term_Prev` and changing the `STATE` to `BROADCAST_NTERM` if true. In any other case, `STATE` switches to `OFF_RZQ_PTERM`."
