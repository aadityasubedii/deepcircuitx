    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a top-level DDR3 memory controller interface with multiple read/write ports. It instantiates a memory controller wrapper and a testbench module to simulate DDR3 operations. The design includes configurable parameters for memory timings, port configurations, and data widths. It manages clock generation, reset handling, and provides interfaces for DDR3 SDRAM signals and multiple read/write ports (p0 to p5) with command, write, and read functionalities."
