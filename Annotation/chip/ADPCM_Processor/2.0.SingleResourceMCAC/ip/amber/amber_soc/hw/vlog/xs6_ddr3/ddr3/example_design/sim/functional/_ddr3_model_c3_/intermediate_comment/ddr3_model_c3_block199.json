    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a dedicated data receiver that is always active and triggered by a positive edge of the 9th bit of the 'dqs_even' signal sequence. The receiver is implemented using an 'always' block which sets up a sequential logic structure, and it invokes the 'dqs_even_receiver' function with argument '9', corresponding to the specific bit position in the signal sequence."
