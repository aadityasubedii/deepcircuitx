    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a timing check at the falling edge of the 26th bit of the dqs_in input signal. Implementation is done within the subroutine procedure named dqs_pos_timing_check which, nominally, takes in an integer argument, here, the bit index 25, to specifically check for the timing of the respective bit of the dqs_in signal on its negative edge transition."
