    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to trigger the function `dqs_pos_timing_check` every time there's a negative edge detected on the bit 19 of the `dqs_in` signal. It's using an always block that reacts to negative edges, meaning it's a synchronous operation usually associated with debugging or timing analysis."
