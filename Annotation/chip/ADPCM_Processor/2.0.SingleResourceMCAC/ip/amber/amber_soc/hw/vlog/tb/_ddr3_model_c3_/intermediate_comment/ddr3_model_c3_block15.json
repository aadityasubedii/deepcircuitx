    "block_comment": "The block of code triggers an event at the positive edge of the 18th bit of the `dqs_in` input signal, calling the procedure `dqs_neg_timing_check` with 17 as its argument. The implementation uses Verilog's event-driven `always` keyword to activate the procedure whenever a specific condition, here the positive edge of a particular bit in the input signal, is met."
