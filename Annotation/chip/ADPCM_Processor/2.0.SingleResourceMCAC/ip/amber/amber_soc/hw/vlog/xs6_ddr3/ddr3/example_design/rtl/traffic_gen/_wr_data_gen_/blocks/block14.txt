Comment: 
This block of code manages a user burst counter in a synchronous design, conditional on the input signals and a specific hardware family. On every positive edge of the input clock, if the first bit of the reset input is high, the user burst counter gets reset. If the command start signal is high, the burst length is checked. For a "SPARTAN6" hardware family and zero burst length, a specific value is assigned; otherwise, the burst length input is assigned directly. If none of these conditions is met but the FIFO is not full and the user burst counter is not zero, the counter is decremented; otherwise, it's reset.
