    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for error detection within a 4-way cache memory system. It activates at the positive edge of the input clock, checking if a data element is hit in more than one cache way. If an error is detected (i.e., if the sum of hit indications for all four ways is greater than one), it triggers an error message by using the macro `TB_ERROR_MESSAGE`, and displays the string \"Hit in more than one cache ways!\". This block's functionality is essential to ensure cache coherence and integrity by single way hits."
