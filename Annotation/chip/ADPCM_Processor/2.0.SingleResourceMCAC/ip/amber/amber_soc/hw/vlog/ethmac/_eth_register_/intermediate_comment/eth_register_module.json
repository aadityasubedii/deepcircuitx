    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'eth_register' module functions as an Ethernet register, latching data bits from 'DataIn' with width 'WIDTH' to 'DataOut' when 'Write' is high at a clock edge. It is reset to 'RESET_VALUE' when either 'Reset' or 'SyncReset' is high. The register uses an 'always' block, triggered at a positive edge of 'Clk' or 'Reset' signal, that prioritizes synchronous reset over a normal reset and normal reset over data write operation. This module also features a parameterizable width and a priority-based reset mechanism."
