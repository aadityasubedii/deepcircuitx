    "block_comment": "The block contains a conditional error check for data access bounds in memory controller operations. The check is performed every time there's a change in output signals mcb_cmd_en_o (enable), mcb_cmd_addr_o (address), and mcb_cmd_bl_o (burst length), or the highest address value (endAddress). If there is indeed an active command (mcb_cmd_en_o = 1) and the cumulative address derived from the current address and burst length exceeds the highest valid address, an error message is displayed, flag error_access_range is set high, and the simulation is stopped. The cumulative address calculation takes into consideration the byte-level address by multiplying the burst length with the width of the data bus (DWIDTH) divided by eight."
