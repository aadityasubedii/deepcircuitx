    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code triggers a function call on the rising edge of 'dqs_in[29]' signal. The function 'dqs_neg_timing_check(29)' is called every time the 29th bit of the 'dqs_in' hardware signal transitions from a low to high state (a positive-edge), maintaining accurate negative timing checks, making this block essential for timely activities in synchronous systems."
