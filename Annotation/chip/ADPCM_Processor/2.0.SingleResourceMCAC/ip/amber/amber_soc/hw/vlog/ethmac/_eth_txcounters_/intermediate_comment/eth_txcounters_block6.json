    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the incrementation of Byte Count based on various conditions. It uses bitwise logical operators on various state data and counter values to determine whether the Byte Count should increment. The increment occurs if the second bit of StateData is 1 while ByteCntMax is not highest (performing a logical AND operation), or if the system is in the 'back off' state and all bits in the least significant 7 bits of NibCnt are 1 (bitwise AND operation), or if the system is in either the 'padding' or 'frame check sequence' state and the least significant bit of NibCnt is 1 while ByteCntMax is not highest."
