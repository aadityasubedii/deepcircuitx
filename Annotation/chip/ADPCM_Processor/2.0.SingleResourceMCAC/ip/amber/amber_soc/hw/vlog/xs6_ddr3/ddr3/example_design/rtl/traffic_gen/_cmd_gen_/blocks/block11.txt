Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog is responsible for conditional assignment based on the predefined FAMILY macro. Specifically, it listens to the positive edge of an input clock signal, and at each clock tick, it checks if the FAMILY macro is set to "SPARTAN6". If it is, `refresh_prbs` is set to a bitwise AND operation of `prbs_instr_b[3]` and `refresh_cmd_en` after a delay of #TCQ time units. If the FAMILY macro is set to anything other than "SPARTAN6", `refresh_prbs` is set to 0 after a delay of #TCQ time units.
