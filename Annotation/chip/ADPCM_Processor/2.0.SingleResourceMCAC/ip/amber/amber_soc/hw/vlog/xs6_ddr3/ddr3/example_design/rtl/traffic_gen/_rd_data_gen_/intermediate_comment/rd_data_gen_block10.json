    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for setting the `cmd_start` and `cmd_start_b` signals based on various conditions. The implementation uses both `if` and `else if` statements to handle different hardware families and memory burst lengths. When the `FAMILY` is \"SPARTAN6\", both `cmd_start` and `cmd_start_b` are assert when `cmd_valid_i` and `cmd_rdy` are high. However, if the `FAMILY` is \"VIRTEX6\" and memory burst length is 4, these signals assert on `rd_mdata_en`. If the burst length is 8, signals depend on negation of `cmd_valid_r1` and `cmd_valid_i` or `user_bl_cnt_is_1`."
