    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code sets up a condition to check if the number of data pins (C_NUM_DQ_PINS) in the system is exactly equal to 8. If this condition is true, it will proceed with name scope 'x8_Addr'. This is implemented using an else if conditional statement which is a part of the decision-making code structures in Verilog RTL. The name scope 'x8_Addr' implies that certain operations or definitions inside this conditional block pertain to an 8-pin address module. Multiple such scopes may exist for different pin configurations in the overall code. It efficiently enables the designer to switch between different module configurations based on hardware specifications."
