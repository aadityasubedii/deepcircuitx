    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional assignment block for a memory interface generator (MIG) port 4, which operates based on the C_PORT_ENABLE[4] flag. If the flag is set, it assigns various functions to respective MIG P4 commands such as enable, clock, row address, bank address, column address, instruction and burst length. Among them, the burst length assignment includes implementation for command instructions or burst length. On the contrary, if C_PORT_ENABLE[4] is not set, all signals related to MIG P4 are assigned to zero, indicating non-functional status."
