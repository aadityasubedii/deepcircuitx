Comment: 
The provided Verilog block serves as a shift-and-expand task, receiving an 8-bit input (`data_in`) and transforming it into a 9-bit output (`data_out`). Starting with the LSB of `data_in`, it performs bit-wise evaluation and manipulation. If any consecutive two bits in `data_in` are '10', the corresponding location in `data_out` is set to '11', otherwise, each bit in `data_out` is either replicated from `data_in` or shifted from the adjacent lower bit set in `data_out`. These conditional operations are executed consecutively for all bits in `data_in`.
