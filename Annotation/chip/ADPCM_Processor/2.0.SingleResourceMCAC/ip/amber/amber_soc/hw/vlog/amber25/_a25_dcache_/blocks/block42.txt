This block of code performs conditional data word read. It uses a 2-bit address (i_address[3:2]) to select and read a 32-bit word from a larger 128-bit data block (data_wdata_r). Depending on the value of the address, a specific 32-bit section of the data block is selected and assigned to 'con_read_data_word'. For instance, if the address value is '00', the lower 32 bits are assigned to 'con_read_data_word'. If the address value is '01', then the next 32 bits (33-64) are assigned, and so on.
