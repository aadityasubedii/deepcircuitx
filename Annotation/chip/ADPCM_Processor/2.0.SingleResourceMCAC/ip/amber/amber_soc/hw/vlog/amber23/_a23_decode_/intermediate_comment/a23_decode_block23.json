    "block_comment": "This block of code manages instruction execution based on memory control states. It assigns select signals for a barrel shifter and an ALU based on control state, load operations, and specific bits of the instruction. It uses a 'Rotate Right' function when certain conditions are met. If the instruction type is TRANS and the 22nd bit of the instruction is set, selection for next ALU output is determined as well. Moreover, it checks for a data abort condition before controlling PC, address select signals or register bank write select signals based on the instruction bits."
