    "block_comment": "This block is used for synchronizing the signal `RxAbortSync2` to the `MRxClk` clock domain and resetting it. It performs this operation whenever there is a rising edge on `MRxClk` or `Reset`. If `Reset` is active, `RxAbortSyncb1` is set to '0' with a propagation delay of `Tp`. Otherwise, the current value of `RxAbortSync2` is assigned to `RxAbortSyncb1` after the same propagation delay."
