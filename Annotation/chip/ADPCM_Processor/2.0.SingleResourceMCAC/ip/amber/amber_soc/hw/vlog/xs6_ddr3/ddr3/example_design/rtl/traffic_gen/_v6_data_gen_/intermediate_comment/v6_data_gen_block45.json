    "block_comment": "This block of code controls data generation and shifting for a memory sequence based on select cases and a determined data mode. It works on a clock edge, checking for command start condition or a ready signal. Depending on the input address, it calls different data generation functions. If the data mode is 4'b0101, it calls a data generation function with the case value as a parameter, otherwise a different data generation function is called. When the memory burst length equals 8, a data rotation operation is performed where the data is shifted and reassigned to the same variable."
