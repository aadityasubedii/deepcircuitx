    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a parameterized module instantiation for 'mcb_raw_wrapper', a possible Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper. This block defines configurations for memory communication, such as clock period, port enable, user interface mode, memory type and density, address order, burst length, and latency. The block details the specific time slots for data arbitration and also includes specific configurations related to DDR memory like operating drive strength (ODS), on-die termination (ODT), precharge power down with slow exit, refresh cycle time, etc. The block even includes parameters indicating delays in data lines (DQ lines) and the calibration modes and delays for memory controller. These parameters will allow users to effectively manage and configure memory communications in the hardware design."
