    "spec": "Module Name: eth_clockgen. \n\nModule Specification: The eth_clockgen is a Verilog RTL module specifically designed to function as a clock generator for Ethernet systems. The module operates based on inputs of Clk (clock signal), Reset, and Divider, which influence the resultant output signals: Mdc (Management Data Clock), MdcEn, and MdcEn_n. The Clk and Reset signals are standard inputs for digital systems providing operational timing and system initialization respectively, while the Divider input allows the user to set the division rate for ethernet clock generation. The output Mdc is a clock signal that is divided according to the Divider input. MdcEn and MdcEn_n are control signals that are high when an internal 8-bit register Counter is at zero, with MdcEn high when Mdc is '0' and MdcEn_n high when Mdc is '1'. These control signals can be utilized to determine whether the Mdc signal is propagated through the broader system. \n\nInternally, the eth_clockgen module employs four signals: Counter, CountEq0, TempDivider, CounterPreset. The counter is pivotal in dividing the clock signal to generate the slower Mdc signal. It's manipulated based on the values of the Reset signal, the CountEq0 signal, and the derived values from the Divider input or decrement operation. The CountEq0 becomes '1' whenever the Counter counts down to zero and affects the state of the Counter, Mdc, MdcEn, and MdcEn_n. The TempDivider and the CounterPreset signals are derived from the Divider input and serve to control the frequency of the Mdc signal and protect against clock division factor falling below a minimum limit.\n\nThe module operates in two distinct code blocks. The first block updates the Counter based on the Clk or Reset signals. In case of reset, the Counter is initialized to a specific default value. Otherwise, it is either loaded with a preset value or decremented according to whether Counter is at zero or not. The second block controls the toggling of the Mdc based on whether the Counter is at zero or not, providing the necessary clock division. Lastly, assignments outside these blocks determine the values of CountEq0, MdcEn, and MdcEn_n based on Mdc and Counter's states.",
