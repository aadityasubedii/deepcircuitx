    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to initialize certain system parameters to their default/initial values. It includes p3_error, p3_error_status, p3_cmp_data, p3_cmp_data_valid, and p3_cmp_error, all of which are assigned a binary value of 0. This is typically done to reset states or prepare data lines for new data, ensuring a clean, error-free start of operations or a clear transition from one state to another in the system's operation."
