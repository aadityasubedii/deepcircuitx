    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for triggering the 'dqs_odd_receiver' function whenever there's a rising edge on the 10th bit of the 'dqs_odd' signal. The function is implemented using an always block that is set to monitor specifically for a 'posedge' or a positive transition on 'dqs_odd[10]', which means effectively a '1' value, indicating a high data-strobe signal. When this condition is met, it will call 'dqs_odd_receiver' passing '10' as a parameter."
