Comment: 
This block of code controls the state of the `cke_train_reg` register based on various system conditions. If an internal system reset (`int_sys_rst`) happens, `cke_train_reg` is set to zero, overriding other conditions. Without a reset, the state of `cke_train_reg` switches to one when `wait_200us_done_r1` is high and `wait_200us_done_r2` is low. If those conditions are not met but `uo_done_cal` is high, then `cke_train_reg` is assigned zero.
