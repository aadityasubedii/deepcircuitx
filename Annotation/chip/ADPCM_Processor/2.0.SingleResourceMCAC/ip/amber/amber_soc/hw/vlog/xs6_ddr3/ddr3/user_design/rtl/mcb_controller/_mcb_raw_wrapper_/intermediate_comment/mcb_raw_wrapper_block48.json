    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code assigns status flags for memory interface generator (MIG) ports. It monitors the read and write operations of four ports (p0, p1, p2, p3). For each port, it assigns empty and full statuses for both read and write operations, identifies errors during read and write operations, and checks overflow for read and underrun for write operations. It achieves this function through simple assignments, associating each port-status to the corresponding status flag from the MIG."
