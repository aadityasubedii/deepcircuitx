    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is a part of a synchronous digital system design that triggers a function named `dqs_even_receiver` at the rising edge of the signal `dqs_even[8]`. To achieve this functionality, the keyword `always` is used in conjunction with the `@` operator to specify a sensitivity list - a list of signals that will trigger the block. In this case, the positive edge, symbolized by `posedge`, of `dqs_even[8]` is the only triggering sign. Consequently, whenever the eighth bit of the `dqs_even` signal changes from low to high, the function `dqs_even_receiver` is triggered with '8' as an argument."
