Comment: 
This line of code is used for conditional bit assignment in a Verilog design. It sets the third bit of the array 'Random' based on condition checking. If the 'RetryCnt' (Retry Count) is greater than 2, the third bit of 'Random' is assigned the value of 'x[2]'. Otherwise, it is set to zero. This is achieved using the conditional operator ':?', which is equivalent to an if-else statement in other high-level languages such as C or Python.
