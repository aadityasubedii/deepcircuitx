The clock is used to synchronize the operations. The write_data input is used to give data to write into the memory while the write_enable input allows or disallows the write operation. The address input specifies where data should be written to or read from.\n\nOutput ports:\n\n1. o_read_data[DATA_WIDTH-1:0]: This port outputs the data that is read from the memory.\n\nExplanation: o_read_data is the interface that the module uses to output data that has been read from the memory.
