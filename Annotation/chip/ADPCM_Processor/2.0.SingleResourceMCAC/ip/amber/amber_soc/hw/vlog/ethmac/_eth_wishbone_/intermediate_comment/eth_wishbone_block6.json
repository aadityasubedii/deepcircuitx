    "block_comment": "This block manages Interrupt Requests (IR) based on the status of the received packet in the Writeback phase. When the system is reset, the interrupt request (RxB_IRQ) is deactivated. If a good packet is received (signified by RxStatusWrite, RxIRQEn, and ReceivedPacketGood), the block checks whether it is a regular packet or a \"pause\" packet, also considers configuration flag r_PassAll and flow control r_RxFlow. Depending on the evaluated conditions, the interrupt request is generated, controlled by the inverse of RxError. In all other cases, the interrupt request is neutralized."
