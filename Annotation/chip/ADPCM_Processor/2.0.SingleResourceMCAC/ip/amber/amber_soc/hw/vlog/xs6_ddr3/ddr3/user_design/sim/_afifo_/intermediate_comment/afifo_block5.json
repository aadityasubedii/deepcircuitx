    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code governs the behavior of a write pointer and its associated Gray code in a read clock domain. This mechanism is triggered by the positive edge of the read clock. When a reset signal is asserted, the write pointer and Gray code are cleared to zeros with a delay defined by the constant TCQ. In the absence of the reset signal, if a write enable signal rises, the write pointer is incremented by one, again with a delay set by TCQ. Meanwhile, regardless of the state of the write enable signal, the write Gray code is updated to the next Gray code, also delayed by TCQ."
