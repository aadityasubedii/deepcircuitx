Comment: 
This block of code represents a state machine transition. It checks the status of the IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N signal. If the signal is not asserted, the state machine remains in its current state, WAIT1. If the signal is high, indicating ready or not busy, the state machine transitions to a new state, LOAD_RZQ_PTERM. The transition implies that an operation, perhaps involving control over an I/O driver, has been completed, enabling movement to the next step.
