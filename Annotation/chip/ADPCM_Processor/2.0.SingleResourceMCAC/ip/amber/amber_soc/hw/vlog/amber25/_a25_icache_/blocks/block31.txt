This code block integrates FPGA-optimized RAM modules to perform tag and data storage functions in a cache system. Specifically, for each way in a set, a tag and a data module are instantiated. Depending on the FPGA vendor type, different type of RAM (e.g., Xilinx Spartan6, Xilinx Virtex6, or generic) is used. A 'generate' loop is used to instantiate all way-tag and way-data pairs. Write enable signals are derived from control signals indicating cache initialization, fill, or tag checks. A data hit signal is derived from several conditions including cache state, address match, and valid bit status.
