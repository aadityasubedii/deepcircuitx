The provided block of Verilog RTL code enables off-chip resistor (RZQ) partial termination. It activates IODRP with RZQ mode, sets the IODRPCTRLR command as valid, sets the targeted memory cell address to PTerm, and prepares the write data and write mode. It also resets the termination impedance levels for P and N terminals, and updates the MCB_UIDRP based on the negated state of the First_In_Term_Done variable. Lastly, it checks the readiness status (IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N) to decide the next state, either remaining in OFF_RZQ_PTERM or proceeding to WAIT7.
