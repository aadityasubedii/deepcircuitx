Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used for carrying out a DQS-based negative edge timing check on a specific DQS line, specifically line 26. It accomplishes this task by continuously monitoring the DQS line, with the check being triggered when there is a positive edge on this line. The 'always' command ensures that the monitoring process runs perpetually during the circuit's operation.
