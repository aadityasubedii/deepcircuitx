    "block_comment": "This block of code manages fault status and fault address in a Verilog system. It operates at the positive edge of the input clock signal (i_clk) except when the system is stalled (i_core_stall = 1). When a fault occurs (i_fault = 1), the fault status and fault address are updated to match the current input values (i_fault_status and i_fault_address, respectively). Debug messages revealing the new fault status and address values will be displayed if the 'A25_COPRO15_DEBUG' condition is compiled in the system."
