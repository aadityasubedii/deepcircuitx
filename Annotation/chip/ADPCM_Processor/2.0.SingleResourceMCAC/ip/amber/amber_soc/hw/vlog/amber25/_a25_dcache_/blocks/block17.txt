This block of code implements the function `pick_way` which assigns values to `pick_way` based on the input parameters `valid_bits` and `random_num`. It uses conditional statements to check the value of each bit in the `valid_bits` array. If the bit at any index is '0',  it assigns a different binary value to `pick_way`, for example, if the bit at index 0 is '0', `pick_way` is assigned '001'. If none of the bits are '0', it moves onto a case statement which uses the input `random_num` to decide what value to assign to `pick_way`.
