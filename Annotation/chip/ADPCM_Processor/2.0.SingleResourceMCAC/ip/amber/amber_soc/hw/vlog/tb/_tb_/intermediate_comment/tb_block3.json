    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily involved in monitoring and managing a timer or timeout system in a Verilog design. The purpose of this block is to check if the system clock 'sys_clk' has reached the specified timeout value. Within the system, every time there's a positive edge of 'sys_clk', it checks whether the 'timeout' is non-zero. If it is, it then checks if the 'clk_count' from the Test Bench has exceeded or met the 'timeout'. If both conditions are true, a timeout error message is displayed, instructing the user to edit a text file to change the timeout."
