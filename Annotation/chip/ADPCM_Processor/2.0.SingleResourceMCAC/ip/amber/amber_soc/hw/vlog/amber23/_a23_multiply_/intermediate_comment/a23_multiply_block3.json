    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for performing certain operations on each positive edge of the input clock without interference from fetch stalls. This block uses the ternary operator to conditionally assign new values to `count`, `product`, and `o_done` based on the state of `i_execute`. If `i_execute` is true, `count` takes the value of `count_nxt`, `product` takes the value of `product_nxt`, and `o_done` is set to true when `count` equals 31, until the next clock edge. If `i_execute` is false, the mentioned variables retain their current values."
