    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a write pointer handler in a memory management system. Upon the positive edge of a 'reset' or 'clk' trigger, the block designates the 'write_pointer' value according to certain conditions. If a 'reset' signal is detected, it sets 'write_pointer' to 0. If a 'clear' signal is received, it sets 'write_pointer' to the 'write' command's value, if (CNT_WIDTH-2) of the bits are 0. If a 'write' command is sent and the memory is not full (~full is true), it increments the 'write_pointer' by 1. The block implements positive edge-triggered sequential logic with sensitivity to 'reset', 'clear', and 'write' commands while also accounting for memory full conditions."
