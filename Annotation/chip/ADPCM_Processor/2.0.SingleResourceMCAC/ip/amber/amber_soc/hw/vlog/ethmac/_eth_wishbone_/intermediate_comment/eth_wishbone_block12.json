    "block_comment": "This block manages the latching mechanism of `RxStatusWrite`. It operates in sync with rising clock edge or after a reset signal. On receiving a `Reset` signal, `RxStatusWriteLatched` is immediately reset. If `RxStatusWriteLatched_syncb2` is high, `RxStatusWriteLatched` is also reset, implying a previous latch process is to be cleared. However, if `RxStatusWrite` is high and not reset beforehand, the `RxStatusWriteLatched` is set, indicating the start of a latch process."
