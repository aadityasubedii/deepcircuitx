    "block_comment": "The given block of code controls the write-enable signal for a tag. It sets 'tag_wenable' to high (1) when the corresponding bits in 'source_sel' for INVA, FILL, or INIT are high, and to low (0) otherwise, essentially providing a bitwise OR operation between the INVA, FILL, and INIT bits of 'source_sel'. Hence, the tag write-enable is controlled based on the status of source selection signals."
