    "block_comment": "The function `convert_arb_slot` reconfigures a provided memory arbitration slot based on the given port configuration and active port data. It first maps the port configuration to a port map using a case statement. Then, it calculates the number of active ports by iterating over the `port_enable` inputs. Based on the number of active ports, it either assigns corresponding portions from the `port_map` to the `convert_arb_slot` output, or assigns the default value of '3'b111'. The final output is the adjusted arbitration slot according to the defined port configuration and active ports."
