This code block is responsible for synchronizing the transmission of data. It operates specifically at the positive edge of either the 'MTxClk' clock signal or 'Reset'. If the 'Reset' signal is detected as 'High', the transmission frame denoted by 'TxStartFrm_sync2' is set to '0', effectively stopping any transmission. If there is no reset signal, 'TxStartFrm_sync2' is updated with the value of 'TxStartFrm_sync1', which carries the propagation delay time 'Tp', thereby initiating or continuing data transmission as necessary.
