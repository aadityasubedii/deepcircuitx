    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronous reset mechanism for the `RxAbortSync1` signal. At the rising edge of either `WB_CLK_I` (Write-back Clock Input) or `Reset`, this block will check if a reset has occurred. If a reset is indeed in progress, `RxAbortSync1` is asynchronously set to 0, achieving clear function. When a reset isn't instigated, `RxAbortSync1` is updated to the latched value of `RxAbortLatched`, allowing the transition of a possibly new value at the next clock cycle. The duration of signal transition is controlled by the delay annotation `#Tp`."
