    "block_comment": "This block handles the availability of a buffer in a data transmission system. On every positive edge of the input clock, it updates a register (`buf_avail_r`) with the current available space in the buffer. The space is calculated as the difference between the count of received data (`rd_data_received_counts`) with an added buffer of 64 bytes, and the count of asked data (`rd_data_counts_asked`). The delay factor `#TCQ` is applied for the timing control in updating the buffer record."
