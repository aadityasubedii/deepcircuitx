This block of code implements a command task that processes various DDR memory commands. Here's a summary of its function and implementation:

[Function of the block]: The cmd_task processes DDR memory commands such as LOAD_MODE, REFRESH, PRECHARGE, ACTIVATE, WRITE, READ, ZQ, and NOP. It handles command execution, timing checks, and state updates for the memory device.

[Implementation details of the block]: The task uses a large case statement to handle different commands. It performs timing checks, updates internal states (e.g., active banks, refresh counters), and manages operations like mode register setting, bank activation, read/write operations, and power management (self-refresh and power-down modes). The task also includes error checking and debugging output for various conditions and violations. It uses multiple internal variables and arrays to track the state of the memory device and its operations.
