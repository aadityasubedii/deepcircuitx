    "block_comment": "The block code assigns an 'undefined' value to the tdqs_n wire. This is achieved by creating a concatenation of ambiguous ('undefined/high impedance' represented by \"1'bz\") values corresponding to the length of DQS_BITS, a previously defined parameter representing the number of Data Strobe (DQS) bits. Using this approach, it effectively sets the entire tdqs_n bus to an undefined state."
