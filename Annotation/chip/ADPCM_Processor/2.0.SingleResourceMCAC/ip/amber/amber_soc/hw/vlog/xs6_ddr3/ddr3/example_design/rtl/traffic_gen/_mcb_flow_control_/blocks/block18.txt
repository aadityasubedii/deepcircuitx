The function of this block is to control the readiness of a command FIFO based on input signals. It gets triggered at the positive edge of the input clock. If a reset signal is detected at the 10th bit, the command FIFO is immediately set as ready. If a transfer command is detected, then the command FIFO is set as 'not ready'. However, if the memory controller buffer is not full, then the command FIFO is set back to 'ready'. Thus, this block ensures the command FIFO is always ready to accept new commands as long as the memory controller buffer has available space and there's no ongoing data transfer.
