    "block_comment": "The Verilog code block functions primarily as an address comparator. Under every rising edge of the clock signal, the block compares each byte section of the output address (addr_out) to the corresponding byte of the end address (end_addr_i), setting A3_G_E3, A2_G_E2, A1_G_E1, and A0_G_E0 high if the output address is greater than or equal to the end address. The bottom 8 address bits require additional handling, factoring in the data width (DWIDTH) and byte length (bl_out) to ensure accurate comparison."
