    "block_comment": "This block configures the P termination attributes for writing to the LDQS clock. It achieves this function by utilizing registers 'IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR', 'IODRPCTRLR_R_WB', and 'IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA' to allocate the appropriate memory cell address, choose the write mode, and set the termination data. Then, it assigns the LDQS clock to the 'MCB_UIADDR' and enables the MCB command. Depending on whether MCB is ready or busy, the state machine either loops within the same state or transitions to wait state."
