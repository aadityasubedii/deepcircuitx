This block of Verilog code dynamically constructs the write data word based on the byte-enable signal. The assigned write_data_word is a composition of the old read data (o_read_data) and new input data (i_write_data), where the byte-enable signal (i_byte_enable) serves as a mask to determine which bytes of the word will be overwritten with new data. If none of the conditions align with the byte-enable mask, the write_data_word is completely overwritten by the new input data.
