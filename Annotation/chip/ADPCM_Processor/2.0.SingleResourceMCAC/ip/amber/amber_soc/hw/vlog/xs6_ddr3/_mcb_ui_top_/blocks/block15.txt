This verilog RTL code block primarily handles the assignment of read/write signals and coordinates AXI bus communication. If the `C_S3_AXI_ENABLE` is disabled, it conducts straightforward signal assignments under a user interface mode. However, in the case where `C_S3_AXI_ENABLE` is enabled, it executes within AXI bus operations mode. It implements signal assignments along with a synchronous logic under the `mcb_ui_top_synch` module for calibration and defines an instance of `axi_mcb` module. The `axi_mcb` involves the parameter and IO declarations necessary for proper AXI transaction, including mechanisms for strict coherency and advanced protocol support. This hierarchical structure separates and encapsulates different levels of operations, providing flexibility for design customization.
