    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed for managing the 'ReceivedPacketTooBig' flag for receiving packet data in a network. It operates synchronously with the positive edge of the MRxClk or Reset signals. Upon reset or loading of a RxStatus, it sets the 'ReceivedPacketTooBig' flag to false. If the 'TakeSample' condition is true, the block checks the received byte count (RxByteCnt) against the maximum frame length (r_MaxFL). If the received byte count exceeds the maximum frame length and Huge Frame Enable bit (~r_HugEn) is not set, it sets the 'ReceivedPacketTooBig' flag to true. This way, it helps to identify frames that are larger than the permissible limit."
