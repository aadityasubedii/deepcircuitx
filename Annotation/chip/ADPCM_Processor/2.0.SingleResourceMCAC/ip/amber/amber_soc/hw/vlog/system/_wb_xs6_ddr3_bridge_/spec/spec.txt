Module name: wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge.

Module Specification: The wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge is a Verilog RTL module that functions as a bridge connecting a Wishbone interface to DDR3 memory. It efficiently manages and translates write and read transactions from the Wishbone interface into commands that DDR3 memory can execute. 

The input ports of the module include i_clk (clock signal), i_mem_ctrl (memory control signal), i_wb_adr (Wishbone address signal), i_wb_sel (Wishbone select signal), i_wb_we (Wishbone write enable signal), i_wb_dat (Wishbone input data), i_wb_cyc (Wishbone cycle control), i_wb_stb (Wishbone synchronization signal), i_cmd_full (indication of full command buffer), i_wr_full (indicator of write buffer fullness), i_rd_data (read data from the memory), and i_rd_empty (indicates the data availability on read).

The output ports of the module include o_wb_dat (Wishbone output data), o_wb_ack (Wishbone acknowledge signal), o_wb_err (Wishbone error signal), o_cmd_en (command enable signal), o_cmd_instr (command instruction signal), o_cmd_byte_addr (byte address for the command), o_wr_en (write enable signal), o_wr_mask (mask for write data), and o_wr_data (data to be written to the memory).

Important internal signals include write_request, read_request, wb_adr_r, cmd_full_r, read_ack_r, read_ready, cmd_en_r, wr_en_r etc, which are used for synchronizing read/write operations, data buffering, error handling and address handling among others.

The code includes several major segments such as signal declarations, signal assignments, combinational and sequential logic, memory addressing, and error handling. Generative blocks are used to manage data write and read operations whilst catering to the modular scheme of the design for different data width configurations. Conditionals and assignments provide the logic for command generation and buffer control. Clock-driven processes handle the timing of operations, ensuring reliable management of data transfer between the Wishbone bus and DDR3 memory.
