    "block_comment": "The function blso performs a bit-level circular shift operation on 18-bit input 'a' with a specific shift and width. The function takes three inputs: 18-bit signal 'a', 'shift' to control the shift amount, and 'width' to control the shifting width. The function initializes 'w' to thrice of 'width', 's' to thrice of 'shift' modulo 'w', and 'blso' to zero. It then performs a for-loop from 0 to 'w'-1 where each bit of 'blso' gets the value of rotated bit from 'a' considering 'shift' value. "
