    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for implementing a delay function in the output drive controller. Utilizing the 'always' directive, the code queues an action to take place whenever there is a change in the 'odt' signal. This action is the assignment of the value of 'odt' to the 'odt_in' signal after a delay defined by the 'BUS_DELAY' constant. This delay simulates physical properties of a bus, such as signal propagation delay. Consequently, the code aligns the timings of various parts of a system communicating through the bus."
