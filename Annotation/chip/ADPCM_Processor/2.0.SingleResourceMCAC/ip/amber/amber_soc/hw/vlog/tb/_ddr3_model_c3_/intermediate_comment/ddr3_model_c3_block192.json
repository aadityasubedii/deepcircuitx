    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a task in Verilog named `dqs_odd_receiver` that processes DQS (data strobe) signals in high-speed memory systems. It takes an input of 4-bit signed integer and applies a bitmask to selectively manipulate data based on a condition. The task generates a 64-bit bitmask that can be adjusted using the input, and applies this mask to the `dq_in` signal. If the `tdqs_en` signal is active, the `dm_in_neg[i]` bit will be forced to 0. Otherwise, it copies the value of `dm_in[i]` to `dm_in_neg[i]`. The mask is used to toggle values of `dq_in_neg` based on `_neg` signals."
