Comment: 
The block of code generates a specific data pattern based on the number of Data Query (DQ) pins and the type of data pattern configured. When the NUM_DQ_PINS is equal to 112 and the pattern is one of "DGEN_NEIGHBOR", "DGEN_WALKING1", "DGEN_WALKING0" or "DGEN_ALL", this specific pattern will be triggered. This is achieved through the use of conditional logic and Verilog "generate" and "if" constructs. The timing of the data pattern generation is controlled by the rising edge of the clock signal (clk_i).
