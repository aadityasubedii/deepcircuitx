Comment: 
This block of code is a synchronous event handler that responds to the rising edge of the clock signal `i_clk`. If the `control_state` is set to `EXECUTE` and the first or the last bit of the `instruction` is indeterminate or X, it triggers an error message. This section of code is primarily for error detection and debugging, alerting developers to the presence of contradicting or undefined values within the `instruction` during the `EXECUTE` state and displays the `instruction` in hex format for ease of identification.
