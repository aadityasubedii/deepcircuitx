This block is used to control the signal `StartOccured` in the presence of variable signals `Reset`, `TxStartFrm_wb`, and `ResetTxBDReady`. Resetting happens at the positive edge of either `Reset` or `WB_CLK_I` signals. If `Reset` is active, the `StartOccured` signal is assigned to '0' after a delay defined by `Tp`. If instead, the `TxStartFrm_wb` is active, `StartOccured` is assigned to '1' acknowledging the start of a new process. If `ResetTxBDReady` is active, `StartOccured` is again set to '0'. The delay `#Tp` accounts for any synchronization requirements between signals.
