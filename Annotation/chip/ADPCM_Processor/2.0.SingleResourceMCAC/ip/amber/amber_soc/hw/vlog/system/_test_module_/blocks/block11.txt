This block of code in Verilog handles the assignment of interruption request values. It uses two 8-bit comparisons to assign values to the o_irq and o_firq signals. When irq_timer and firq_timer each equals to 1, the output signals o_irq and o_firq are asserted respectively, indicating that an interruption request has been made.
