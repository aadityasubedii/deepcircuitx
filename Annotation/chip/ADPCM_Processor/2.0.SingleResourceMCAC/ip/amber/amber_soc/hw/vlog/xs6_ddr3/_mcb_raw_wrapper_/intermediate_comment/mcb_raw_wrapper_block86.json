    "block_comment": "This code block governs the condition under which a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) lock signal is gated. The block utilizes a conditional statement (if-else) to determine the gating action. If 'normal_operation_window' is true, the 'gated_pll_lock' signal assumes the state of the 'pll_lock' signal. If 'normal_operation_window' is false, then the 'gated_pll_lock' signal takes on the state of 'syn_uiclk_pll_lock' signal."
