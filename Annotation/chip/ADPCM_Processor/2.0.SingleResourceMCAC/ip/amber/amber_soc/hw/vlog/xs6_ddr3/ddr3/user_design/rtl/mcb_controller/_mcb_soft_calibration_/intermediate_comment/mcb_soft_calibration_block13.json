    "block_comment": "This block of code is a dynamic calibration flow control for wait self-refresh exit DQS calibration signal. It relies on an edge-triggered design, running its logic on the positive edge of UI_CLK. At initialization or reset, WAIT_SELFREFRESH_EXIT_DQS_CAL is set low. If the mode switches from non-self-refresh to self-refresh, WAIT_SELFREFRESH_EXIT_DQS_CAL is set high. Once self-refresh request is low and a dynamic calibration after self-refresh is detected, WAIT_SELFREFRESH_EXIT_DQS_CAL is reset for the next cycle."
