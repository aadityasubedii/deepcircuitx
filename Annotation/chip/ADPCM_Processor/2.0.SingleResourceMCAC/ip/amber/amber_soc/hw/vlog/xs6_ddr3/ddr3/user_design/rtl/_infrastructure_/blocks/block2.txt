Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is primarily utilised for maintaining and controlling the reset synchronisation operation, and it works on the positive edge of either 'clk0_bufg' (clock signal) or 'rst_tmp' (reset signal). If the reset 'rst_tmp' is high, then the reset synchronisation 'rst0_sync_r' is set to a value with the number of bits defined by 'RST_SYNC_NUM' all as high ('1'). In case the reset 'rst_tmp' is not high, it implies that the system is not in reset condition and then the 'rst0_sync_r' value is right-shifted one bit position every clock cycle.
