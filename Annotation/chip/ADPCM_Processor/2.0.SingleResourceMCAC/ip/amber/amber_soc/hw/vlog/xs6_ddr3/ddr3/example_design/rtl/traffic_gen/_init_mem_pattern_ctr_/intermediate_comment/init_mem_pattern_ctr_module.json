    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, init_mem_pattern_ctr, is tasked with pattern generation for memory initialization and testing in FPGA hardware. It uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) design pattern and a switch-case structure for implementing its functions. The FSM states include idle, memory initialization for write/read, and testing memory. Inputs like command address, control signals, and reset signals are processed and manipulated using internal registers and signals to control the memory operations and testing. Outputs like start and end addresses, mode selections, and seed values are generated based on these operations. It supports both SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 FPGA families."
