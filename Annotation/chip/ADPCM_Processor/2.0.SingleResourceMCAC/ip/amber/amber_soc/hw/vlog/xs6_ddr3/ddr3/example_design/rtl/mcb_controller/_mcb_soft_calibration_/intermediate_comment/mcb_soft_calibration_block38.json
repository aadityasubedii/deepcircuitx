    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block configures write access to IOI_LDQS_PIN memory cell with desired termination parameters. Initially, it waits until the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal is not busy (indicative of the Memory Controller Buffer's state). Once ready, it sets up write mode on IODRPCTRLR_R_WB and then assigns the termination parameters \"PTerm\" and \"P_Term_s\" to IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR and IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA respectively. Subsequently, it points the MCB_UIADDR to IOI_LDQS_PIN and sets MCB_CMD_VALID to a value of '1' to validate the command. If the MCB remains ready, it continues this state."
