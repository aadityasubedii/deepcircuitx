    "block_comment": "This block serves to interface with the AXI bus and MCB (Memory Controller Block) on a Spartan6 FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). The code achieves this via two main modules: `mcb_ui_top_synch` and `axi_mcb`. The `mcb_ui_top_synch` module synchronizes the calibration completion signal `uo_done_cal` from the user interface with the AXI clock signal `s3_axi_aclk`. The results of this sync are stored in the `calib_done_synch` wire. The `axi_mcb` module creates the AXI and MCB interfaces, with various parameters set to control their behavior (ID width, ADDR width, data width, etc.). Signal assignments and the masking of the `s3_axi_araddr` and `s3_axi_awaddr` signals with `P_S3_AXI_ADDRMASK` are used to bind the AXI bus signals to this module. Paths for signals to flow between the AXI bus, MCB, and rest of the system are also established via this module."
