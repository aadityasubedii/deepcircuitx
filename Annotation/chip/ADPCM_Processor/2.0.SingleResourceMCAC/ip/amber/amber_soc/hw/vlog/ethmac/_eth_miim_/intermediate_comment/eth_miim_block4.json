    "block_comment": "This codeblock in Verilog is responsible for controlling the timing of latching data bytes during a read operation from an external device. The LatchByte1_d2 and LatchByte0_d2 signals are driven high when three conditions are met: (i) a read operation is in progress (detected by the InProgress signal), (ii) the operation is not a write operation (indicated by negation of WriteOp signal), and (iii) the BitCounter signal reached 'b1110011' or 'b1111111' (55 in decimal, or 63 in decimal), corresponding to desire the index of the bit transfer stage in read operation where two bytes of data are latched.\nNote: Please revise your comment accordingly when the function of code is enhanced or any hardware changes impacting this code will be made."
