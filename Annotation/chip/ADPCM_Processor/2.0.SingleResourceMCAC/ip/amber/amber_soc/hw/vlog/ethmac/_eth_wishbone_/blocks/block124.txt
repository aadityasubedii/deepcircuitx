Comment: 
The block handles the condition for reading data from the memory during transmission processes. This is accomplished by leveraging key transmission signals, including 'TxBufferAlmostFull', 'MasterWbTX', 'TxAbortPacket_NotCleared', and 'TxRetryPacket_NotCleared'. Conditions such as if the transmission buffer is almost full or if there's only a small amount of data left to transmit trigger activation. Additionally, any specific signal to abort or retry a transmission or the completion of a packet transmission causes the process to stop.
