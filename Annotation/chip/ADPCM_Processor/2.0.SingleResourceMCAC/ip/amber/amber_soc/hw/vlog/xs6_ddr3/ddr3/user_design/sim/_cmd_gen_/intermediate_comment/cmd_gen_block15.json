    "block_comment": "This module increments a read count in synchronous memory operations. On the positive edge of the input clock signal, if the fifth bit (index 4) of the reset signal 'rst_i' is high, the read count ('force_rd_counts') is reset to zero with a delay defined by #TCQ. Otherwise, if the 'instr_vld' flag is true, the read count is incremented by one, again with the #TCQ delay. The purpose is to monitor and control memory read operations in a manner synchronized to the input clock signal."
