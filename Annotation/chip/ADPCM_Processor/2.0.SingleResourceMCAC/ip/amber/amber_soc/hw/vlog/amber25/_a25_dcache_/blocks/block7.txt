This block of code functions as a debugging tool inside a cache implementation. The block is triggered by a rising edge clock signal (`i_clk`). It checks whether the sum of the values from three data hit ways (part of cache) exceeds 1, indicating data has been found in more than one way. If this occurs, it generates an error message and displays a warning "Hit in more than one cache ways!" to notify the developer about possibly erroneous behaviour in the cache system. This can help in diagnosing and resolving issues related to simultaneous multiple cache hits.
