Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is basically a synchronous reset and read-first data flag control. It responds to the positive edge of `clk_i` signal, and the reset is active high (`rst_i`). When the reset goes high, the read-first data flag `rd_first_data` is set to 0 after a delay that corresponds to `TCQ` (Time Clock to output, delay). However, if the reset is not high and the queue is not empty (indicated by `~empty`) and was previously noted as empty (`empty_r` is high), the read-first data flag is set to 1 after the same `TCQ` delay. This essentially denotes the availability of data for the first read operation, following a previously empty state of the queue.
