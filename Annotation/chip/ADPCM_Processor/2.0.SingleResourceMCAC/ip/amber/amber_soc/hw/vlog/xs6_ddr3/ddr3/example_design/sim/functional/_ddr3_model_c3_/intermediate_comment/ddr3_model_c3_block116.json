    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code triggers the function dq_timing_check with the argument 14, whenever there is a change in the 15th bit of the dq_in data queue. It employs the sensitivity list mechanism in Verilog which will react to any change in the listed signals, in this case, the 15th bit of dq_in. This method ensures timely handling of data queue handling according to index position changes."
