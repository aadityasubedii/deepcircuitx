Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements a top-level wrapper for a memory controller block (MCB) with user interface functionality. It integrates AXI interfaces, arbitration logic, and a raw MCB wrapper, supporting up to 6 configurable ports. The module manages clocks, translates addresses, and controls data flow between user interfaces and the memory controller. It implements port multiplexing, AXI-to-MCB conversion, and calibration logic to provide a flexible and efficient interface for memory operations.
