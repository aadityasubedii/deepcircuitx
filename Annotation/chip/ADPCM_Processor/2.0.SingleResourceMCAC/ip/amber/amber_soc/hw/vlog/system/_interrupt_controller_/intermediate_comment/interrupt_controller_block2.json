    "block_comment": "This block handles register read access for a Wishbone interface, specifically for interrupt controller registers in an Amber CPU multi-core environment. It responds to the `wb_start_read` signal at the rising edge of the clock (i_clk). Depending on the address specified (`i_wb_adr`), it sets `wb_rdata32` with the corresponding register data. It handles multiple types of interrupts including IRQ, FIRQ, soft interrupts with provision for RAWSTAT and status. The default case handles situations where an unknown register is read, sending a predefined value `32'h22334455` as a response."
