    "block_comment": "The block of code is implementing a toggle functionality in a transmission line. This toggle function is specified using the XOR operator, signified by '^'. The XOR operation happens between the 'tx_push' and the 'tx_push_r'. If both have the same value, the result or output 'tx_push_toggle' is 0; otherwise, it is 1, hence acting as a toggle.\n"
