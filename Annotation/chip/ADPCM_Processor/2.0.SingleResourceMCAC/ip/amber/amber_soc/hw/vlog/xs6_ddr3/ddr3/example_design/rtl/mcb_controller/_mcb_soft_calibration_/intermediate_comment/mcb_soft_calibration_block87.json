    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a clock-dependent state update in a memory controller module. The 'DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL' register is updated on the rising edge of 'UI_CLK', which acts as a user interface clock. The new value of 'DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL' is determined by a combinational logic. If 'DQS_DELAY_INITIAL' is not zero indicating the delay process has started, or the current state equals to 'DONE' combined with the condition that memory controller block calibration ('MCB_UODONECAL') is completed, the register 'DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL' is updated to reflect that both soft and hard calibrations are done."
