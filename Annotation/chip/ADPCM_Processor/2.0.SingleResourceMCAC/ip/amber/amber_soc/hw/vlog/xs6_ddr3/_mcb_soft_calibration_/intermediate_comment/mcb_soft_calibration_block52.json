    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code block is used for synchronizing the status signal (MCB_UODATAVALID) with the UI clock (UI_CLK). The block is activated (triggers an event) at every positive edge of both UI_CLK and MCB_UODATAVALID. If MCB_UODATAVALID signal is high, MCB_UODATAVALID_U is set high until the next positive edge of UI_CLK or MCB_UODATAVALID. If MCB_UODATAVALID signal is low, MCB_UODATAVALID_U retains its previous state. This technique is typically used in digital logic design for synchronizing signals across different clock domains."
