This block of code is responsible for updating the state of a register 'xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE_R' at the rising edge of the system clock signal 'i_clk'. It's comprised an 'always' block which is triggered whenever the 'i_clk' signal goes from low to high (posedge). During this event, the state of the register 'xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE_R' is updated with the current state of the 'xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE' variable, mirroring its value.
