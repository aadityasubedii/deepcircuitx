    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the value of the 'Pre_SYSRST' signal to the 'MCB_SYSRST' signal. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment, creating a connection between the two signals. Through this line, whenever the 'Pre_SYSRST' signal changes, the 'MCB_SYSRST' signal will instantly update with the new value, indicating a system reset control mechanism in a memory controller block (MCB)."
