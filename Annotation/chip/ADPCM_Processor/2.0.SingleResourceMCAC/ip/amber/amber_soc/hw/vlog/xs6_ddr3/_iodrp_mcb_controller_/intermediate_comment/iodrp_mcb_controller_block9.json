    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a shift register with a synchronous reset and data loading functionality. Triggered at the positive edge of the DRP_CLK, it performs a clear operation if the 'sync_rst' signal is high- setting the 9-bit 'shift_through_reg' register to zero. If 'sync_rst' is low, the data loading operation is checked. If 'load_shift_n' signal is high, the register is loaded with 'data_out_mux'. Otherwise, it performs a shift operation, moving values of 'DRP_SDO' and bits 7:1 of 'shift_through_reg' while setting the highest bit to zero."
