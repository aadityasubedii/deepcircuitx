This block of code describes a sequential logic element that monitors the state of a write command. It is designed to trigger on the positive edge of an input clock signal. If the reset signal 'rst_i[0]' is high, it sets 'cmd_wr_pending_r1' to 0 after a delay defined by 'TCQ'. Otherwise, if the last word has been written ('last_word_wr_i' is true), it sets 'cmd_wr_pending_r1' to 1, again with a 'TCQ' delay. Additionally, if a push command is detected ('push_cmd' is true), it resets 'cmd_wr_pending_r1' back to 0. This sequential logic handles write operations in data transmission or storage systems.
