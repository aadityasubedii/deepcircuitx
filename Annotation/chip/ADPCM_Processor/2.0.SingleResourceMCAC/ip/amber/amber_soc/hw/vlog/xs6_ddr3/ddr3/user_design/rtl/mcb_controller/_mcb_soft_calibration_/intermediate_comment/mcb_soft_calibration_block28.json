    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a 16-bit WAIT_200us_COUNTER that is either reset or incremented upon each clock cycle. This counter can be used for generating a delay of approximately 200us. The counter is reset at the positive edge of the RST signal or UI_CLK signal, and when under simulation, it's loaded with a preset value 16'h7FF0 for quick operation. Otherwise, it starts from zero. In non-reset conditions, if the most significant bit (15th bit) of the counter is 1, the counter value keeps its current value (stops counting), else it increments by one in every positive edge of UI_CLK."
