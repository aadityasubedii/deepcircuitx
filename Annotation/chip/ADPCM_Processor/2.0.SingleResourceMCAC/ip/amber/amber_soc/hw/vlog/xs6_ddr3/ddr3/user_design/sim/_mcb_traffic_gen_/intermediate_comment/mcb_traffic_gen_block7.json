    "block_comment": "This block of code is a conditional hardware generation block, which generates one of two paths based on the `PORT_MODE`. If `PORT_MODE` is either \"RD_MODE\" or \"BI_MODE\", a `read_data_path` hardware block is instantiated. The `read_data_path` has several parameters and input/output ports related to properties like minimum cycle delay (`TCQ`), data width (`DWIDTH`), error width (`DQ_ERROR_WIDTH`), and more. It is designed to handle memory operations such as read and write, with control signals to initiate actions (like `cmd_valid_i` for command validation and `cmd_en_i` for enabling command) and to respond to conditions (like `cmd_rdy_o` for command ready and `data_rdy_o` for data ready). It also handles error conditions, as specified by `dq_error_bytelane_cmp` and `cumlative_dq_lane_error`. If `PORT_MODE` is not \"RD_MODE\" or \"BI_MODE\", only the `cmp_error` signal is set to 0, constituting the `WR_ONLY_PATH`."
