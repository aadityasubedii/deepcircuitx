The block of code describes an asynchronous behavior where a timing check function is triggered. The always @ the mechanism is specifically listening for a negative edge transition on the sixth bit of the 'dqs_in' signal vector. Whenever there is a negative edge on the 'dqs_in[5]' signal, the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function corresponding to the sixth bit is called, probably for a timing check or synchronization purpose.
