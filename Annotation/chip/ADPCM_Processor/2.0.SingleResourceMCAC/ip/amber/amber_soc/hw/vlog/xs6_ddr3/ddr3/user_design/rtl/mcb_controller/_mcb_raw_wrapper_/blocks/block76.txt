Without the rest of the code block, I can tell you that this block denotes a combinational logic block in Verilog. The term always @(*) implies that the block of code following this line will always be executed whenever any of its inputs change. This block is usually used to model combinational circuits in hardware design, but the specific function of the block can't be determined from the provided part of the code alone. Please provide the complete Verilog RTL code block to generate precise comment.
