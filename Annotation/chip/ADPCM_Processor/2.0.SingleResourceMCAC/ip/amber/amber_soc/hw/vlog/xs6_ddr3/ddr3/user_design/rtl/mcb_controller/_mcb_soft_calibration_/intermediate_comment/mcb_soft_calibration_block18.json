    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily operates as a reset circuit in a Verilog design. Triggered by either a positive edge clock signal (UI_CLK) or a reset signal (non_violating_rst), the logic in this block will set the reset register (RST_reg) to a high logic level (1'b1). If neither the clock nor the reset occurs, it uses the inverse value of the 16th bit of a 200-microsecond wait counter (WAIT_200us_COUNTER[15]) to set the reset register; otherwise, it retains the current value of the reset register (rst_tmp)."
