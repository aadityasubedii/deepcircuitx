Comment: 
This single line Verilog code defines an electrical wire named `cmd_rd_en`. This is not a module or a code block, it is simply a wire declaration often used to connect different modules or different parts of a design. The `cmd_rd_en` is usually used as a signal for enabling read commands in the context it is used. Implementation-wise, since it is a wire, it simply routes the output of one logic gate to the inputs of one or more other logic gates within the design. The specific function and use of `cmd_rd_en` would typically become clear in the context of larger pieces of code where it is used.
