This block of code generates a specific data pattern based on the number of Data Query (DQ) pins and the set data pattern type. In case the number of DQ pins is 72 and a Data Pattern type such as DGEN_NEIGHBOR, DGEN_WALKING1, DGEN_WALKING0, or DGEN_ALL is set, a corresponding data generation pattern WALKING_ONE_72_PATTERN is initiated. This pattern is activated on every positive edge of the input clock signal, handled by an always block triggered at each 'posedge' of 'clk_i'.
