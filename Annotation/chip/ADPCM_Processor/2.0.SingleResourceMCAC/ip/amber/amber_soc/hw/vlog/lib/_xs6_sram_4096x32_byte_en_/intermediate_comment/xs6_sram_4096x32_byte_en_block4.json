    "block_comment": "The block appears to be the instantiation of a dual-port Block RAM (RAMB16BWER) in a Xilinx Spartan-6 chip. Implementing as a 8-bit memory storage, it's initialized with default values (SRAM4_INIT_0 to SRAM4_INIT_63), each representing specific start-up states. The RAM's ports have 9-bit data widths. The block disables the registers at the output of Block RAM and sets synchronous reset type with Clock Enable(C.E.) being the reset priority. It specifies that no additional reset is provided to the contents of RAM and the simulation tool checks for all types of collisions. The READ_FIRST mode means any write operation is done after possible read for the same clock cycle."
