    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily functions as a custom reset task that initializes and clears system registers and variables. It accomplishes its task by setting a variety of flags, counters, enabling bits, state bits, pipeline settings, and memory handling flags to their initial states. Most notably, it clears the DQ and DQS valid input and output signals, resets write and read DQ/DQS counters, nullifies the On-Die Termination (ODT) and dynamic ODT enabling and state values, resets active and precharge bank parameters for read/write operations, and resets various other system initializations, pipelines, and modes including DLL and power management flags."
