    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing state transitions, specifically between the \"WAIT1\" and \"LOAD_RZQ_PTERM\" states in a finite state machine. The transition between states is dependent on the 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' signal. If 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' is not asserted, indicating that the system is either not ready or busy, the state machine transitions to the \"WAIT1\" state. Otherwise, it transitions to the \"LOAD_RZQ_PTERM\" state, indicating that it's time to load RZQ termination configuration."
