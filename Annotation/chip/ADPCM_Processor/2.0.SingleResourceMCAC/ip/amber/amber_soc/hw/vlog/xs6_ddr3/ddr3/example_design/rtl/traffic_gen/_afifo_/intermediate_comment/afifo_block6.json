    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for managing the 'empty' status of a buffer based on certain conditions. Using a positive edge-triggered clock (rd_clk), it evaluates the conditions within the block at every clock cycle. If a reset (rst) is triggered, the buffer is marked as empty. Otherwise, the buffer is also marked as empty if it is currently not filled (buf_filled equals to 0) or if it is partially filled (buf_filled equals to 1) but a read strobe (rd_strobe) is activated. If these conditions are not met, the buffer is flagged as not empty. The code uses a delay of TCQ time units for these assignments to account for circuit level propagation times."
