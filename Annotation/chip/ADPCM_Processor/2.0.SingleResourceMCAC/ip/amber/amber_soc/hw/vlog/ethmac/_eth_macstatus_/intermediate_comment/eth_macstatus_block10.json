    "block_comment": "This block of code handles receiver late collision conditions in a serial data transmission. When a master reset, 'Reset', or status loading, 'LoadRxStatus', condition is detected at the rising edge of the master receive clock, 'MRxClk', it clears the 'RxLateCollision' flag by assigning it zero. If neither condition is detected, but a mid-transmission collision 'Collision' is signaled (with no 'FullD' and either 'RxColWindow' is not set or 'RecSmall' is set), it sets the 'RxLateCollision' flag to one, indicating a late collision has occurred."
