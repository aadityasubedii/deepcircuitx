    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code generates specific data patterns based on the number of Data Query (DQ) pins and the type of Data Pattern defined. If the number of DQ pins is set to 16 and the Data Pattern is either \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\", a specific data pattern referred to as 'WALKING_ONE_16_PATTERN' is generated. In particular, data pattern generation is achieved through conditional checks on the number of DQ pins and the type of Data Pattern."
