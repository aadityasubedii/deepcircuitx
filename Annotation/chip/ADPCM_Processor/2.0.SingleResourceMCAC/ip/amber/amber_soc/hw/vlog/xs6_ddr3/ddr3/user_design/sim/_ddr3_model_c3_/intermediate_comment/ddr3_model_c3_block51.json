    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for triggering a procedure named `dqs_pos_timing_check` upon the positive edge of signal `dqs_in[14]`. It utilizes an \"always@\" block in Verilog to constantly monitor for a positive edge transition (indicated by the 'posedge' keyword) on the 15th bit of the `dqs_in` signal. When such a transition is detected, it calls the `dqs_pos_timing_check` procedure with argument `14`."
