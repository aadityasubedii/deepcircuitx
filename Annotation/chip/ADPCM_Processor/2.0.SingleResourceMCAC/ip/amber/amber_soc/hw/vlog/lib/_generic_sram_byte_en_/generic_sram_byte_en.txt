Module-level comment: The 'generic_sram_byte_en' module simulates a RAM block with byte-enable functionality. It provides read/write operations to a memory array of size determined by the ADDRESS_WIDTH and each element of width DATA_WIDTH. Operations are driven by an input clock signal. If the write_enable is high, data from i_write_data is written into the memory array at address 'i_address'. Enabled bytes are determined by the i_byte_enable signal. When write is not enabled, the data at 'i_address' is read out to o_read_data. The module handles byte-wise operations internally using an int 'i' as loop counter.
