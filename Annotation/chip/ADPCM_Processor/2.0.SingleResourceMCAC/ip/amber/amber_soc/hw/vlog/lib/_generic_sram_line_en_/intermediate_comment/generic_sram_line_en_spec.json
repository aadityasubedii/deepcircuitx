The main purpose of this module is to read and write data into an internal memory array 'mem' synchronously with the positive edge of 'i_clk'. The module's inputs are 'i_clk', 'i_write_data', 'i_write_enable', and 'i_address'. 'i_clk' is the clock input, synchronizing all operations. 'i_write_data' is the input data to be written into the memory, enabled by 'i_write_enable' during a clock pulse. The 'i_address' input indicates the memory location to write to or read from. The output from this module is 'o_read_data', which is the data read from the memory at the specified 'i_address'. The internal array 'mem' represents memory spaces, sized as 2 to the power of ADDRESS_WIDTH, with each element DATA_WIDTH bits wide. The module also includes generation logic to initialize 'mem' to all zeros if INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO parameter is set to 1, and contains a synchronous block triggered at the positive edge of 'i_clk' which governs the read and write operations. Based on the 'i_write_enable' signal, this block decides whether to write 'i_write_data' into 'mem' or output the existing data at 'i_address' onto 'o_read_data'.",

It allows data to be written (i_write_data) into the array (mem) at an address (i_address) specified when the write enable signal (i_write_enable) is asserted. During the rising edge of the clock(i_clk), if the write enable is not asserted then the data present at the given address location is read onto the output 'o_read_data'. If 'INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO' is set to 1, the SRAM is initialized with all zeros.
