Comment: 
The block is designed to carry out memory erasure in specific banks. Depending on the macro MAX_MEM, it either erases memory in the specified banks or reorganizes the memory contents, keeping only those not marked for erasure. Initially, if MAX_MEM is defined, for each bank, if the corresponding bit in the input 'banks' is set, then the file descriptor associated with that bank is closed and reopened, effectively erasing the contents. If MAX_MEM is undefined, the block essentially moves unmarked memory contents to the beginning of the banks and 'erases' the rest by assigning undefined values, thus compacting the memory and updating the 'memory_used' counter.
