    "block_comment": "The function `more_to_come` checks if there are any more set bits in a 16-bit register from a given position to the most significant bit. The function takes two inputs - a register or bit array `regs` and an index `i`. The case statement inside the function evaluates the bitwise OR operation of `regs` from `i`th index to the 15th index (MSB). If the result is 1 (meaning one or more bits in this range are set), the function returns 1 otherwise it returns 0. For `i` equal to 15, the function directly assigns 0 to `more_to_come`, as there are no bits above the 15th position."
