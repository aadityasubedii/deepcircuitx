    "block_comment": "This line of code is assigning the output of the pseudorandom binary sequence (PBRS) to the variable prbs_o. Essentially, prbs_o now holds a PRBS value, enabling it to function as the output for the PRBS generator implemented elsewhere in the code. Being a straightforward hardware assignment, this can be an independent concurrent process, demonstrating the inherent parallelism of Verilog language."
