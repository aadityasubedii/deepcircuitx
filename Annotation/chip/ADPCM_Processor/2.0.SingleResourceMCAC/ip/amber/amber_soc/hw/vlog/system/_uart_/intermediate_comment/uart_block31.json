    "block_comment": "This block is designed to set the width of the Wishbone data bus to either 32-bits or 128-bits based on the value of WB_DWIDTH. If WB_DWIDTH is 128, the block selectively assigns a 4-bit portion of the input data (i_wb_dat) to wb_wdata32 based on the top two bits of the address (i_wb_adr). The output data (o_wb_dat) is then generated by replicating wb_rdata32 four times. If WB_DWIDTH is not 128, the block directly assigns the input data to wb_wdata32 and wb_rdata32 to the output data."
