Module-level comment: 
/**
 * Memory Controller Testbench Top Module
 * 
 * This module implements a testbench for a multi-port memory controller.
 * It generates and controls memory read/write operations for up to 6 ports,
 * simulating various access patterns and checking for errors. The module
 * instantiates traffic generators and memory pattern controllers for each
 * enabled port, with configurable parameters for port modes, data widths,
 * and address ranges. It handles command and data signals, implements error
 * checking, and supports different operating modes for each port.
