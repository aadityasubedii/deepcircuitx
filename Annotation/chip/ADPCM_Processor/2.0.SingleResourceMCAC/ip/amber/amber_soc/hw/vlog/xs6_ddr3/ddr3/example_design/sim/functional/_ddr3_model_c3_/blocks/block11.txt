Comment: 
The block of code arranges a timing check function to be triggered on each positive edge of the 21st bit of the input signal `dqs_in`. This is achieved by employing an always-block which monitors transitions on the 21st bit of `dqs_in`, invoking the `dqs_neg_timing_check(21)` function whenever a positive edge is detected.
