This block implements an output buffer in Verilog (OBUFT) for bank address signals in a memory system. It does this by using a generate loop which instantiates an output buffer (OBUFT) for each bit in the memory's bank address width (C_MEM_BANKADDR_WIDTH). The input to the buffer (.I) is the corresponding bit from the bank address input (ioi_ba), the output enable (.T) is taken from the corresponding bit in the buffer control signal (t_ba), and the output (.O) is connected to the corresponding bit in the output bank address (mcbx_dram_ba).
