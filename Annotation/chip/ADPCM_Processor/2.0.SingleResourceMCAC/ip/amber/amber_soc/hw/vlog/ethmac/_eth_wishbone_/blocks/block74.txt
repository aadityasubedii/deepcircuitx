This block of code dictates the behavior of the ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb2 signal. It is governed by sensitivity to the rising edge of MTxClk or Reset. If Reset is active, ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb2 is set to 0, else it assumes the value of ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb1 signal at the positive edge of MTxClk.
