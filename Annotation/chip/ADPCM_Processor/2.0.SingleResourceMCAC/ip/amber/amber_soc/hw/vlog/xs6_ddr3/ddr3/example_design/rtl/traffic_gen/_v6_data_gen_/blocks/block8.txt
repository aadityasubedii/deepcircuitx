Comment: 
This block of code performs a bit-wise XOR operation on two data sets: 'hdata' and 'w1data'. It iterates over each bit in the 'hdata' and 'w1data' arrays, up to four times the value of 'NUM_DQ_PINS', performing an XOR operation and assigning the result to the equivalent index in the 'ndata' array. The output 'ndata' array thus contains the XOR results of corresponding bits of 'hdata' and 'w1data'.
