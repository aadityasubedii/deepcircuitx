Module name: generic_sram_line_en. 

Module specification: This module represents a generic synchronous Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) with line enables. The main purpose of this module is to read and write data into an internal memory array 'mem' synchronously with the positive edge of 'i_clk'. The module's inputs are 'i_clk', 'i_write_data', 'i_write_enable', and 'i_address'. 'i_clk' is the clock input, synchronizing all operations. 'i_write_data' is the input data to be written into the memory, enabled by 'i_write_enable' during a clock pulse. The 'i_address' input indicates the memory location to write to or read from. The output from this module is 'o_read_data', which is the data read from the memory at the specified 'i_address'. The internal array 'mem' represents memory spaces, sized as 2 to the power of ADDRESS_WIDTH, with each element DATA_WIDTH bits wide. The module also includes generation logic to initialize 'mem' to all zeros if INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO parameter is set to 1, and contains a synchronous block triggered at the positive edge of 'i_clk' which governs the read and write operations. Based on the 'i_write_enable' signal, this block decides whether to write 'i_write_data' into 'mem' or output the existing data at 'i_address' onto 'o_read_data'.
