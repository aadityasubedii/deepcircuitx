Comment: 
This block controls the state transition in a finite state machine (FSM) on the rising edge of the DRP_CLK clock signal. Whenever a synchronous reset (sync_rst) is active, it resets the current state to READY. Otherwise, the state changes to whatever is defined as the next state (nextstate).
