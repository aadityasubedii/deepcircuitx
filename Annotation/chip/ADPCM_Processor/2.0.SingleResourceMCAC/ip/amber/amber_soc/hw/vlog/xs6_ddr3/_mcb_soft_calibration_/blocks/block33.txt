This block of code manages the state transitions in a memory controller. When `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` signal is inactive (indicating the memory controller is busy), the system state moves into the `WAIT5` state. If `First_In_Term_Done` signal is active, it checks for `MCB_UOREFRSHFLAG`. If this flag is true, it updates the `MCB_UIDRPUPDATE` status and further checks if `N_Term` is not equal to `N_Term_Prev`. If so, it updates `N_Term_Prev` to `N_Term` and transitions the state to `BROADCAST_NTERM; otherwise, it transitions the state to `OFF_RZQ_PTERM`. When `MCB_UOREFRSHFLAG` signal is not active, the system state moves to `WAIT5` state.
