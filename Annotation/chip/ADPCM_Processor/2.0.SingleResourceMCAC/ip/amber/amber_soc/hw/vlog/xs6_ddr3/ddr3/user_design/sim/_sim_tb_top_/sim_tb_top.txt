Module-level comment: 
/*
This module is a testbench for a DDR3 memory controller. It simulates the memory subsystem by:
1. Generating clock and reset signals
2. Instantiating a DDR3 controller and memory model
3. Setting up test parameters and signals
4. Running a test sequence with error checking
5. Monitoring calibration and initialization processes
6. Logging test results (pass/fail)
The testbench uses internal signals to connect components and verify correct operation of the DDR3 controller.
