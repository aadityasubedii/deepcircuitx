Comment: 
This line of Verilog code assigns the value of `c3_sys_clk` to `c3_sys_clk_p`. This essentially mirrors the signal from `c3_sys_clk` to `c3_sys_clk_p`, ensuring that any change in the state of `c3_sys_clk` is immediately reflected in `c3_sys_clk_p`. This could be used, for instance, to propagate a system clock signal to another part of the circuit logic where the mirrored signal `c3_sys_clk_p` is required. The `assign` statement makes this a continuous assignment, causing the values to be updated instantly whenever there is a change.
