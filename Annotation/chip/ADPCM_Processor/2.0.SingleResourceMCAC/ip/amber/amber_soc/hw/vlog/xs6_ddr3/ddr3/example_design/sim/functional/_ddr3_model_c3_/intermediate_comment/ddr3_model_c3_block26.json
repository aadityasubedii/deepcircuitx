    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a clock edge detector for a specific index of the signal `dqs_in[]` array at negative edge. Whenever a negative edge (falling transition) is detected on the 7th element of `dqs_in[]` array, the function `dqs_neg_timing_check()` is invoked with the index '6' as the argument to ensure proper timing compliance associated to the negative clock edge signal transitions."
