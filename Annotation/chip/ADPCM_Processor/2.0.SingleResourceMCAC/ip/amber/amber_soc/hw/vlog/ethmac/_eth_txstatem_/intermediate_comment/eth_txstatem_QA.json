The system has input flags such as CarrierSense, Collision, UnderRun, and various others that could describe the state of transmission or the ethernet frame. The module uses these inputs to dictate the operation of the state machine within it, thus managing the transmission process and handling any occurring issues such as collision or underruns. State transitions are triggered by specific conditions and controlled by signals like 'StartIdle', 'StartPAD', 'StartIPG', etc. It also handles resetting the various states of the transmission when a reset signal is received. Conditions for state transitions are specified by elaborate boolean expressions. And finally, it appears to be following a Time-division Multiple Access (TDMA) transmission strategy based on the use of the Inter-Packet Gap (IPG)."

StartJam\n8. StartBackoff\n9. StartDefer\n\nExplanation: \n\n1. StartIdle: This wire is set when the system is in the StateIPG (Inter-Packet Gap state), and when a certain condition is satisfied relating to the NibCnt not being smaller than the specified IPG time. This signal indicates a transition to the idle state from the IPG state. \n\n2. StartIPG: This wire is set when the system is in the StateDefers state (meaning there's no ongoing transmission due to adverse conditions), as long as it's not an excessive defer and there's no carrier present. This signal triggers the IPG state, which is a mandatory waiting period to help minimize collisions due to simultaneous frames transmissions.\n\n3. StartPreamble: This signal triggers the beginning of the preamble state from the idle state when the TxStartFrm signal is asserted and there's no carrier detected. The preamble is a standard sequence transmitted at the beginning of every Ethernet frame, which helps the receiver synchronize with the data stream.\n\n4. StartData: An array of 2 wires, where StartData[0] is set when there was no collision, and either the StatePreamble was just completed or the second phase of data transmission is ongoing. StartData[1] is triggered when the first phase of data transmission is ongoing and the frame hasn't reached its maximum size yet. They control the data transmission states, allowing ethernet data to be sent.\n\n5. StartPAD: This wire is set if the last data transmission phase ended, and the frame needs padding. This happens when transmitting a small packet (smaller than the minimum ethernet frame size), and the signal helps trigger a state that adds padding bytes to the frame.\n\n6. StartFCS: This wire is used to trigger the Frame Check Sequence state. FCS is a kind of 'checksum', a sequence added at the end of the ethernet frame to allow the receiving system to verify the integrity of received data.\n\n7. StartJam: This signal starts the jamming sequence in order to make sure that all devices on the network recognize the collision event. It's triggered whenever there's a collision or an UnderRun condition during statePreamble or data transmission states.\n\n8. StartBackoff: This signal is triggered when there's a collision. After a collision, a random backoff period is set to avoid further collisions. \n\n9. StartDefer: This signal triggers the deferring state, indicating that the transmitter will have to wait before attempting to send the frame again. This usually happens if a carrier signal is detected, meaning another device is transmitting.\n"
