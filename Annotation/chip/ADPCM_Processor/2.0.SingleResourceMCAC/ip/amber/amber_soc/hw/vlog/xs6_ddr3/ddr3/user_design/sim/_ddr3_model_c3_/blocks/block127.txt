The block of code triggers a function called 'dq_timing_check' which is invoked every time there's any change in the 4th bit of the dq_in input array. The implementation detail involves an 'always' block that listens for any change @(dq_in[3]) in the 4th element of the 'dq_in' bit-array. When a change is detected, it calls the 'dq_timing_check' function with '3' as an argument.
