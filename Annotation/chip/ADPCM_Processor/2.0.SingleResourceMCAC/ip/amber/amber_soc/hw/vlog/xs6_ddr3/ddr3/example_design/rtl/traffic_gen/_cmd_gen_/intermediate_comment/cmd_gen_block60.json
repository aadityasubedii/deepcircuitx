    "block_comment": "This block of code is intended to generate a controlled pulse, `run_traffic_pulse`, in response to an active high input signal, `run_traffic_i`, using a clock signal `clk_i`. On every positive edge of the clock signal, the input signal `run_traffic_i` is registered into `run_traffic_r`. If `run_traffic_i` is high and `run_traffic_r` is low (i.e., a rising edge is detected on `run_traffic_i`), the output `run_traffic_pulse` is set high on the next clock cycle, otherwise, it is set low."
