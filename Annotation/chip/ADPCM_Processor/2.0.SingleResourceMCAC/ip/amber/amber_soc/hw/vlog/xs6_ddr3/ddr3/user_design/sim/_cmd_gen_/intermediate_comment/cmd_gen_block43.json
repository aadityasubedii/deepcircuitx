    "block_comment": "This block handles data read and write pipeline using conditions specific to SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6 families. It works with synchronous reset signal or when instruction is valid. It formats `pipe_data_in` differently depending upon mode and conditions specific to hardware families and resources availability. For example, in SPARTAN6 & read-mode, bits [34:32] of `pipe_data_in` are assigned based on bits [2:1] of `instr_out` and a separate bit, while in other cases, different conditions apply to modify the 'pipe_data_in`. It uses a large set of conditions to define the mechanism, leading to specific result under each condition."
