    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls a synchronous flip-flop with the signal TxStartFrm_syncb2. The flip-flop's output follows the input signal TxStartFrm_syncb1 at each positive edge of the clock WB_CLK_I, unless a positive edge of the Reset signal is detected first. In that case, the output signal TxStartFrm_syncb2 is reset to 0, effectively overriding the input signal and ensuring the flip-flop's output remains zero until the Reset is de-asserted."
