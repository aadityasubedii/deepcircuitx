Comment: 
This block of code manages the status of a data transmission process in a Verilog system under different conditions. The status is updated at the positive edge of WB_CLK_I or when Reset is triggered. When Reset is high, TxStatus is immediately set to 0, effectively resetting it. However, if the transmission is enabled (TxEn & TxEn_q) and a read from the Block Descriptor (TxBDRead) is being performed, TxStatus is updated with the output of the ram_do block with a bit-width of 4 (between indices 14:11).
