    "block_comment": "This block of code controls a byte counter within a receive (Rx) data path of a communication module. Whenever there is a rising edge on the Master Rx Clock (MRxClk) or a system reset, the code checks a series of conditions: if the system reset, an ended shift or an abort command is received, it resets the counter to zero; otherwise, if a valid start of a frame is received, it increments the counter based on the lowest significant bit of the RxPointer; finally, if a valid byte within the enabled window or the last byte is received, it increments the counter by one. The purpose is to keep track of the position within a byte-stream for a communication protocol."
