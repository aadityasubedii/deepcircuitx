This block configures the memory interface generator (MIG) under different conditions. If the 184th through 160th bits and 56th through 32nd bits of `C_PORT_CONFIG` are both "B32" & "W32" respectively, the directives inside `u_config1_4W` are enabled. These directives conditionally connect read and write clock signals, data, masks, enable signals, and status indicators between the processor (P4) and the MIG depending on whether the 5th bit of `C_PORT_ENABLE` is active. If it's inactive, the connections are grounded. The directives within `u_config1_4R` are similar, but they are only evaluated when the configuration bits are "B32" & "R32".
