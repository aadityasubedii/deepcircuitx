    "block_comment": "This block of code forms a register for counting addresses in a synchronous design. Triggered on the rising edge of the input clock (clk_i), the address counter register (addr_counts_next_r) is updated with a new count value (#TCQ), which is the sum of the existing address count (addr_counts) plus a predefined increment (INC_COUNTS). This mechanism ensures the address counter keeps progressing synchronously in tandem with the system clock, thus facilitating sequentially incremented addressing in routing or memory operations."
