Comment: 
This block of code is a conditional block that configures the pull-up and pull-down of the Data Strobe (DQS) signal for different memory types in an FPGA memory controller. Based on the type of memory (DDR, MDDR, or DDR2 under specific conditions), it generates corresponding hardware configurations. For DDR or MDDR, as well as for DDR2 with no differential DQS, it uses the PULLDOWN function for DQS operations. For any other cases (represented in else condition), it applies both PULLDOWN and PULLUP functions to perform DQS operations, implementing differential signaling for DQS and DQS_N signals.
