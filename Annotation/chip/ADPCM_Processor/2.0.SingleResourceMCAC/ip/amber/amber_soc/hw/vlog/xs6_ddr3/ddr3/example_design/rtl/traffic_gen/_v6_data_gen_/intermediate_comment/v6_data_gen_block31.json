    "block_comment": "This block of code dynamically generates a specific data pattern depending upon two input parameters: NUM_DQ_PINS and DATA_PATTERN. If NUM_DQ_PINS is equal to 104 and any of the four specific patterns (\"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\" or \"DGEN_ALL\") is selected, then this block of code will be activated. This is achieved using the 'generate' and 'if' constructs in Verilog, which allow for the conditional generation of hardware based on given conditions."
