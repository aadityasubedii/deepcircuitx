    "block_comment": "The function `get_32bit_signal` is designed to fetch a specific 32-bit signal based upon the input parameter passed as `num`. This is achieved using a \"case\" statement within Verilog. There can be six possible values for `num`, ranging from 0 to 5, each connected to a distinct signal from `U_EXECUTE` or `U_WB` module. For example, a number 0 returns 'pc_nxt' signal from `U_EXECUTE` module while a number 5 returns 'daddress_r' signal from `U_WB` module. If no matching case is found, the output remains the same as the current state."
