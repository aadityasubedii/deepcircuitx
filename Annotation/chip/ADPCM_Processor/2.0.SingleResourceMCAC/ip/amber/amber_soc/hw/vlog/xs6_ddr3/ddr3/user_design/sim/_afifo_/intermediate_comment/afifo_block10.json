    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a value to the signal `rd_strobe`. The signal `rd_strobe` gets a high value (1) when `rd_en` is high, indicating a read enable state, and the queue is not empty (i.e., `empty` is low or 0). Otherwise, `rd_strobe` is low. This design ensures that a read operation from the queue (or buffer) is only permitted if it is not empty, preventing errors caused by underflow conditions."
