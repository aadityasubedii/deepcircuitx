Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls the Receiver (Rx) collision window logic. On a positive edge of the Master Receive (MRx) clock or a system Reset signal, the module checks the conditions and acts accordingly. If the Reset signal is high, the RxColWindow is set to 1. If there is no ongoing collision (indicated by the Collision signal) and the receive byte count equals the Collision validity signal and the second bit of the RxStateData is high, then the RxColWindow is set to low. If the system enters a Receive Idle state, the RxColWindow is again set to 1. The variable Tp refers to propagation delay for the module.
