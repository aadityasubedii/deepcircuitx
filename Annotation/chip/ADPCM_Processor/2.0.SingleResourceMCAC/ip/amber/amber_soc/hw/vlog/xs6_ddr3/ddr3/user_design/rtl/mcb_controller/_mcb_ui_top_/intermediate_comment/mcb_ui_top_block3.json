    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the value of the 'p5_arb_en' to the 'p5_arb_en_i'. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used to model combinational logic, where output's value is tied to the current values of its inputs. Here it means that the control signal 'p5_arb_en' drives the input 'p5_arb_en_i'."
