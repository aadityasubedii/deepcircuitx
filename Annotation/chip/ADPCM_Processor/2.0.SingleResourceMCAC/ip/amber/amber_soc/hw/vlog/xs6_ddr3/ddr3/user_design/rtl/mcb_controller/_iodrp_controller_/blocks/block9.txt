This block of code implements a multiplexer with two inputs, the `memcell_addr_reg` and `data_reg` registers, and an output, `data_out_mux`. The controlling input of this multiplexer is the `addr_data_sel_n` signal, where when it's high, the output results in `memcell_addr_reg` and when it's low, the output is `data_reg`. This multiplexer block is used to switch between `memcell_addr_reg` and `data_reg` based on the value of the `addr_data_sel_n` signal.
