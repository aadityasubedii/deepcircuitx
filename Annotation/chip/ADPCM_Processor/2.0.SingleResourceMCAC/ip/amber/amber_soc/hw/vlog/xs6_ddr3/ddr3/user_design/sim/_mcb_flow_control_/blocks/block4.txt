The block performs asynchronous reads on the rising edge of the input clock signal. It makes use of cmd_rd and push_cmd as control signals to set the status of the cmd_rd_pending_r1 signal. If both cmd_rd and push_cmd are active, then the cmd_rd_pending_r1 signal is set high. However, if xfer_cmd signal is active, the cmd_rd_pending_r1 signal is set low. Activity on these control signals dictates the behavior of the block in configuring the cmd_rd_pending_r1 signal under different conditions.
