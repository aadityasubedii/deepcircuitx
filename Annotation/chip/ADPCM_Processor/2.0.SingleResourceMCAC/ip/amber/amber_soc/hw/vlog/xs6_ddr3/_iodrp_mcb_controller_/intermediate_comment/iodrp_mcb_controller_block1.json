    "block_comment": "This block of code is a state machine controller. It governs the transitions between different states of an RTL design's state machine using a synchronous reset signal. The change of state is aligned with the positive edge of the DRP_CLK signal, and when the sync_reset signal is asserted, it resets the state back to the READY condition. Otherwise, it updates the state to the nextstate as determined elsewhere in the design. This block ensures the robust and predictable functioning of the state machine under all circumstances."
