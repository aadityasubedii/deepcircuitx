This block of code controls the writing operation in a system. It checks several conditions at the rising edge of the input clock (clk_i). If a reset signal (rst_i[0]) is incoming, or the last word has been written (last_word_wr_i), the system sets 'wr_in_progress' to 0, indicating no active write operation. However, if the system is in a WRITE state, 'wr_in_progress' is set to 1, indicating an ongoing write operation. Timing control delays are included with '#TCQ', guiding the behavior of the system according to the device specifications.
