    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the synchronization of the 'ShiftEndedSync' signal across clock domains. It is implemented as a flip-flop with an active-high reset and updates on the rising edge of a 'MRxClk' clock signal or upon a 'Reset'. If 'Reset' goes high, the output 'ShiftEndedSync_c2' is reset to zero, otherwise, it follows the 'ShiftEndedSync_c1' input. The '#Tp' delay essentially models the flip-flop propagation delay."
