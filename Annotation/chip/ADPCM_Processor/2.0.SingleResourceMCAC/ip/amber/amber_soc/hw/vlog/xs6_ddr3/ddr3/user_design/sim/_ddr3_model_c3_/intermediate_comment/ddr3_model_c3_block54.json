    "block_comment": "This block of code decides the timing of the check operation based on the positive edge of the digital signal 'dqs_in[11]'. The operation 'dqs_pos_timing_check(11)' is invoked every time there's a transition from low to high in the 11th bit of 'dqs_in'. This kind of trigger mechanism is commonly used for synchronization in digital circuits."
