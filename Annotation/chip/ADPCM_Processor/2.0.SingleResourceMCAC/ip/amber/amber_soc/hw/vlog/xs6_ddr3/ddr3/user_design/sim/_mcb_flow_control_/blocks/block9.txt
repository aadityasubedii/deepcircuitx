The block generates the 'wait_done' signal based on different conditions. It uses a combination of various incoming signals and constant values, i.e., 'clk_i', 'rst_i', 'push_cmd_r', 'cmd_rdy_o', 'cmd_valid_i', and a constant 'FAMILY' to manage the 'wait_done' signal. On a positive edge of the clock, if the ninth bit of the 'rst_i' signal is 1 or if the 'push_cmd_r' signal is high, 'wait_done' is set to 1. However, if the 'cmd_rdy_o' and 'cmd_valid_i' signals are both high and the device family is SPARTAN6, 'wait_done' is reset to 0.
