    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to perform a timing check task for data queue (dq). This check validates if certain timing constraints `TDH` and `TDIPW` for data queue bit `i` are violated. If a violation is detected, an error message is displayed. The implementation uses temporal checking. For `TDH` violation, it checks if the difference between the current time and `tm_dqs` for data queue bit `i` is smaller than `TDH`. For `tDIPW` violation, it checks if the difference between the current time and `tm_dq` for data queue bit `i` is smaller than `TDIPW`. The information about the prerequisite conditions (`dqs_in_valid`) and the completion of check (`check_dq_tdipw`) are stored in internal registers. The time of the check (`tm_dq[i]`) is updated every time the task runs.\n\n"
