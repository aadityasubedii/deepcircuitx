    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for assigning an address (`data_address`) based on a set of conditions. The `data_address` is selected from various sources including `miss_address`, `i_address`, or `address` depending on certain flags such as `consecutive_write`, `write_hit`, `source_sel[C_FILL]`, and `source_sel[C_CORE]`. For instance, `miss_address` is used when either `consecutive_write` or `source_sel[C_FILL]` is true. When either of these conditions do not hold, `data_address` defaults to an all-zero value of width `CACHE_ADDR_WIDTH`."
