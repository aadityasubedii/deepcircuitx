This block manages the timing check for command addresses. More specifically, the block is always sensitive to changes in the 12th bit of the `addr_in` variable (which is coded as `addr_in[11]` due to index starting from 0). Whenever a change is detected, it triggers the function `cmd_addr_timing_check` with the value `18` as a parameter. This function is used to validate the appropriate timing of command addresses.
