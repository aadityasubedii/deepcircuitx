    "block_comment": "The Verilog code block assigns the value of 'DribbleRxEndFrm'. It is formed by performing an AND operation on the second bit ('StateData[1]') and the negation of 'MRxDV', then another AND operation on the result and 'ByteCntGreat2'. This block appears to be part of a state machine controlling a data receiver, where 'DribbleRxEndFrm' signifies whether an end of frame should be sent based on the current state data, the incoming data's validity, and whether the byte count is over two."
