    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is responsible for handling the synchronization of the `TxRetry` signal based on the system clock `WB_CLK_I` and a reset signal. When a rising edge is detected on the reset signal, it asynchronously sets `TxRetrySync1` to low. Otherwise, on each positive edge of the system clock, the `TxRetry` signal is latched synchronously into `TxRetrySync1` after a propagation delay `#Tp`.\n"
