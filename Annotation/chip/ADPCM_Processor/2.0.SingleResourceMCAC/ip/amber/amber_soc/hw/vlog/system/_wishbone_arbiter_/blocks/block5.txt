This block of code assigns data from one of the eight possible slave modules to the master module in a multiplexer-like fashion. It uses conditional operators to check the value of the 'current_slave' variable. Depending on the 'current_slave' value (from 4'd0 to 4'd7), the data from the corresponding slave (i_sX_wb_dat where X ranges from 0 to 7) is chosen and assigned to the 'master_rdat'. If the 'current_slave' value doesn't match any case, the data from 'i_s2_wb_dat' will be assigned as a default.
