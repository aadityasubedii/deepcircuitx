    "block_comment": "The code block functions as part of a control logic for a certain hardware component. It calculates the value of the signal 'MdcEn', which is presumably an enable flag for a function abbreviated as 'Mdc'. The implementation is such that 'MdcEn' is assigned a Boolean 'AND' operation between 'CountEq0' signal and the negation of 'Mdc' signal. Meaning, 'MdcEn' is set to high when 'CountEq0' is true, and 'Mdc' is not set simultaneously. This could be used to enable 'Mdc' operation when count equals zero and not already in process."
