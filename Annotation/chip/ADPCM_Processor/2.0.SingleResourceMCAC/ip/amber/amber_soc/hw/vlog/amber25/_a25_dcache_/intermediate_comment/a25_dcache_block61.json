    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for updating the value of the variable 'wb_rdata_burst' each time a rising edge is detected on 'i_clk'. Implementation-wise, this code achieves this function by using an always block that is sensitive to the positive edge of 'i_clk'. Inside this, it checks if 'i_wb_cached_ready' is high. If it is, 'wb_rdata_burst' gets updated with the value of the variable 'i_wb_cached_rdata'."
