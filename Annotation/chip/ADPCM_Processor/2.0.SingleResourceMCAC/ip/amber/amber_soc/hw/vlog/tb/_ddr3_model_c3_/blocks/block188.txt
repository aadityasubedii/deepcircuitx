This block of code implements an edge-triggered behavior in a Verilog design. Its function is to call the `dqs_odd_receiver` function whenever there is a positive edge transition detected on `dqs_odd[3]`. The `always @` statement triggers the function call whenever the `posedge` event on `dqs_odd[3]` occurs, signifying a transition from low to high.
