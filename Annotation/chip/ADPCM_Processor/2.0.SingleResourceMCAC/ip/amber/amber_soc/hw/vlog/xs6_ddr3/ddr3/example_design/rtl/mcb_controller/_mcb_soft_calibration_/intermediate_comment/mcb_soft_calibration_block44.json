    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the Mode Control Block's (MCB) operation mode and transmission system. It sets the Input Output Dynamic Random Access Memory (IODRPCTRLR) mode to WRITE_MODE, and ensures the MCB command is valid. It also determines if the MCB will update UDRAM based on the first term completion signal. A backstore use flag is set, and the state machine's next state is determined based on the ready-busy signal from MCB. If MCB is ready, it shifts to a broadcast precharge termination state; else, it remains in a waiting state."
