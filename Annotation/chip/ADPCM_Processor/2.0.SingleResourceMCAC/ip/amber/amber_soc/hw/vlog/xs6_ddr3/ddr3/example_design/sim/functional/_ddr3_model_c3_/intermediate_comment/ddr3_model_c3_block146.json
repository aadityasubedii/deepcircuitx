    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to invoke a digital timing check function `dm_timing_check( 1)`. The function is called whenever there is a change in the value of `dm_in[ 1]`, as denoted by the `always @` syntax. The purpose of this block is to check the timing of the digital input signals and ensure that they are within acceptable limits, thus maintaining the overall integrity of the system. This is achieved by continually monitoring the `dm_in[ 1]` bit of the digital input signal and triggering the `dm_timing_check( 1)` function whenever a change is detected."
