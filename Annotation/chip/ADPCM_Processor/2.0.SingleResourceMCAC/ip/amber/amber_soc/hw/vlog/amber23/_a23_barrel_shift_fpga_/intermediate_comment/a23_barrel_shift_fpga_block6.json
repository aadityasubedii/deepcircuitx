    "block_comment": "This block performs an Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR) operation on the input signal 'i_in'. Construction-wise, it uses a conditional statement to ascertain whether the most significant bit (31st bit) of 'i_in' is set. If it is, 'asr_out[0]' is set to the value of 'i_in[31]'. If not, it's set to the logical AND operation result of 'p_r[31]' and 'lsr_mask[31]'."
