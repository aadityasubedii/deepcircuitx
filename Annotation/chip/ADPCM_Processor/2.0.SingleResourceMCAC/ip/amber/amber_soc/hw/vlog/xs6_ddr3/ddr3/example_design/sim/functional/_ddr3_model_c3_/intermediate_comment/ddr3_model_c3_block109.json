    "block_comment": "This code block performs a timing check on dq_in's 22nd bit. It specifically invokes a function called dq_timing_check when there's a change in the 22nd bit of dq_in. The chosen bit acts as a monitoring point for the 'always' block to call the timing verification function, helping to maintain the correct signal timing throughout the execution."
