These parameters are used to adjust the size of input and output ports. The module uses an internal RAM to store data which can be read or written with the specific address provided. Writing and reading are controlled by the activation of 'i_wb_we' (write enable) or 'i_wb_stb' (strobe) signals respectively. Additionally, the module creates different data masks and addresses based on the control signal 'i_mem_ctrl' and data width specification. The generated output data is provided through 'o_wb_dat' and the acknowledgment of the operation is represented by 'o_wb_ack' signal. To avoid concurrent read/write operations, it utilizes two-stage handshake protocol ('busy' signal). The module is tailored to handle both 128 and 32-bit width data operations."
