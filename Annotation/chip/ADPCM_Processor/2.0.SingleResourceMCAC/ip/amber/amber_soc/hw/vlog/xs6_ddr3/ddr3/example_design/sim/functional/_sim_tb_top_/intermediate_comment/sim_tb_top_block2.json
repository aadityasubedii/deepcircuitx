    "block_comment": "This block of code generates an instance of a DDR3 model (u_mem_c3) based on the number of data query pins (C3_NUM_DQ_PINS). If there are 16 data query pins, extra signals (mcb3_dram_udm and mcb3_dram_udqs for dm_tdqs, and mcb3_dram_udqs_n for dqs_n) are connected. If not, these signals are not involved in the dqs, dqs_n, and dm_tdqs ports of the DDR3 model. The DDR3 model captures the memory operations including activation, read, and write, controlled by typical DDR3 control lines (ras_n, cas_n, we_n, etc.).\n"
