    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code instantiates a sensitivity list that monitors changes in the 29th bit of the dq_in bus. On any change detected in this specific bit, it triggers the function dq_timing_check, passing 28 as an argument, a likely reference to this 29th bit (Verilog syntax starts counting from zero). So overall, this snippet is used for real-time monitoring and triggering specific action (timing check) upon changes in a designated bit of the input data bus."
