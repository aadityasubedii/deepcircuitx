    "block_comment": "This Verilog block assigns the output `TxEndFrmOut` based on the value of the control signal `CtrlMux`. If `CtrlMux` is true, the assignment is the value of `TxCtrlEndFrm`; otherwise, it's the value of `TxEndFrmIn`. This can be seen as a control flow decision based on a multiplexer, with `CtrlMux` serving as the select signal."
