Comment: 
This block detects the rising edge of the UART receiver interrupt signal and displays debug messages based on its state. Upon each clock's positive edge, it latches the state of the receive interrupt into 'uart0_rx_int_d1'. If there's an interrupt and 'uart0_rx_int_d1' is not set (i.e., a new interrupt), it displays the status of the FIFO control signals. It does the same when the interrupt is cleared (i.e., checking for the falling edge of interrupt).
