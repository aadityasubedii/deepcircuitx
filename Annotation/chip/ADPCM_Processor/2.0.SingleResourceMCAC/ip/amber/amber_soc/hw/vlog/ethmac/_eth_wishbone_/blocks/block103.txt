This block of code handles the assignment of the `RxBDAddress` register under various cases dictated by different signals. On the positive edge of `WB_CLK_I` clock signal or a high `Reset`, the operations inside the block will be executed. If `Reset` is high, `RxBDAddress` will be reset to 0. If `Reset` signal is not high and `r_RxEn` is active while its previous state `r_RxEn_q` was not (i.e., `r_RxEn` has risen), the `RxBDAddress` will be assigned the value of `r_TxBDNum[6:0]`. And if `Reset` is inactive and `RxStatusWrite` is high, `RxBDAddress` will take the value from `TempRxBDAddress`. This block implements an edge-triggered, synchronous design and leverages various control signals that determine the state of the `RxBDAddress` to ensure correct functioning.
