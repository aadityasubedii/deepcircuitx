This block of code is used to decipher the current value of the 'control_state' and relate it to a descriptive string, which assists in debugging. This is achieved by using the ternary operator in Verilog language, which tests the 'control_state' against predefined constants. If it matches, the appropriate state's string is returned, making it easier to understand and debug the system by viewing the state names instead of the raw numerical values.
