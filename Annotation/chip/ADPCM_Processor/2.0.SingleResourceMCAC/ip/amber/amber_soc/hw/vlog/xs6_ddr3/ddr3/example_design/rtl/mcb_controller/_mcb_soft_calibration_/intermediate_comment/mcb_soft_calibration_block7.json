    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for analyzing the maximum value and adjusting the delay in the aforementioned process, depending on certain conditions. Initially, the block checks if the first dynamic calibration has been done; if it hasn't, it triggers the dynamic calibration by shifting the state to FIRST_DYN_CAL. If the calibration is done and the maximum value is less than the previous max value, and the decrement threshold has been met, it adjusts the state to decrement and recalculates the target delay. Similarly, if the maximum value is higher than the previous maximum value and the increment threshold has been met, it adjusts the state to increment and recalculates the target delay. If none of these conditions are met, it simply assigns the previous max value as the current max value and shifts the state to initiate the dynamic calibration."
