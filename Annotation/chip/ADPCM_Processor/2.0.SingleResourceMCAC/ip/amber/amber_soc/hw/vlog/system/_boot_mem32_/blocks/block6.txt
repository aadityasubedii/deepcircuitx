Comment: 
The block of code customizes the output acknowledgement signal (`o_wb_ack`) for a Wishbone bus controller, based on the preprocessor definition (`AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG`). If the debug mode is enabled (`AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG` is defined), it accounts for jitter in the read start signal (indexed by `jitter_r[1]`), else it uses the normal read start signal (`start_read_r`). In both cases, `o_wb_ack` is asserted when there's a strobe input (`i_wb_stb`) and either a write or a read starts.
