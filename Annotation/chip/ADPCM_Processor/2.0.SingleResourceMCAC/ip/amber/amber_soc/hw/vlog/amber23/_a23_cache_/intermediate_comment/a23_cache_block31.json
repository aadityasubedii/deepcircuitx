    "block_comment": "This block designs a cache memory system with configurable FPGA-specific implementation and parameters. The code utilizes a loop with macro definitions to generate different modules for different FPGA architectures such as Xilinx Spartan6, Virtex6, or a general case if no specific FPGA architecture is defined. Each iteration creates an SRAM-line-enabling block with 21-bit line data width for tag data, and a byte-enabling block for cache data with 128-bit line data width. The handshaking occurs through signals like clock, write data, write enable, address, and read data. External condition checks are done for write enable signals of tag and data, and for a data hit, adjusting data flow based on the cache state, HIT/MISS conditions, and specific source selection states. The tag and data addresses are compared to identify if a cache hit occurs."
