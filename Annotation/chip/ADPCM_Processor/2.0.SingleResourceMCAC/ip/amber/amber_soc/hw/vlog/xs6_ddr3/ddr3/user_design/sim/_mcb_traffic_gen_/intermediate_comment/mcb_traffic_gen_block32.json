    "block_comment": "This block manages a write Memory Controller Buffer (MCB). It sets the \"full\" status of the write MCB depending on the reset condition and the number of elements in the FIFO buffer. Upon a positive clock edge, if the asynchronous reset signal `rst_ra[0]` is high, the MCB write full flags `mcb_wr_full_r1` and `mcb_wr_full_r2` are reset, signifying the MCB is not full. If the reset signal is low and the FIFO buffer count is 63 or more, the full flags are set, indicating the MCB is full. Otherwise, the full flags remain reset. The TCQ parameter indicates technology-specific timing for the assignments."
