    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code implements a 2-bit Output Serializer (OSERDES2), termed as \"ioi_we_0\". This data output block is set up with the properties of bypassing global clock flip floppy, specific data output rates and a master mode of serial deserialization. The OSERDES2 is clocked by 'ioclk0' and reset by 'int_sys_rst', while the 'we_90' data is input in give bits D1 and D2. Remaining data are kept at '0'. The clock divider input and all True Dual Data Rate outputs (T1-T4) are tied to '0'. 'IOCE' is set to 'pll_ce_0' and 'OCE', controlling the global output enable and per-bit output enable, are set to '1' respectively. No active training function is deployed since 'TRAIN' is set to be '0'."
