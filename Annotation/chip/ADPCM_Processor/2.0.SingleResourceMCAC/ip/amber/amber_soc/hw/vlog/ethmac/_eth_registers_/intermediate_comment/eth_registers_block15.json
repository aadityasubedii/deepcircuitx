    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for the synchronous reset and sequential updating of the `SetRxCIrq_sync2` register. Depending upon the signal inputs, the design triggers an update in response to either a positive edge clock pulse (`Clk`) or a positive edge reset pulse (`Reset`). If a reset signal is received, the `SetRxCIrq_sync2` register is reset to zero. Otherwise, in the case of a clock pulse, the `SetRxCIrq_sync2` register synchronously assumes the value of `SetRxCIrq_sync1`."
