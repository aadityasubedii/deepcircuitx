    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to monitor a specific event on a Data Queue Signal (DQS) bus. It is triggered on the rising edge of the 32nd signal of the `dqs_in` array, which is represented by `dqs_in[31]`. Upon the occurrence of this event, it calls the function `dqs_neg_timing_check` with argument 31. This function is presumably designed to check the timing or synchronization issues at the specified index of the DQS bus."
