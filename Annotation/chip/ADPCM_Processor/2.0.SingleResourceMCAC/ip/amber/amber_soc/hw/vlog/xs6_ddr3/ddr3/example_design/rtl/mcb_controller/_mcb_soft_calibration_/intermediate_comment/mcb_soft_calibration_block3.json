    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is mainly responsible for controlling a counter decrement and managing the delay phase of a data strobe (DQS) in a memory controller interface. The code has a certain state-based functionality where different sections of the code are responsible for different states (3'b011, 3'b010, and default). In the state 3'b011, the counter is increased and checked if it is greater than or equal to 0x04 and if the DQS_DELAY is more than its lower limit, two signals are set for decrement and DQS_DELAY is decremented. In the state 3'b010, the code checks whether the DQS_DELAY exceeds its lower limit and sets state to DECREMENT accordingly. In the default state, the DQS dynamic calibration is set to start."
