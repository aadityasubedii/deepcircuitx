    "block_comment": "This block of code instantiates a memory controller block (\"mcb_raw_wrapper\") specifically tailored to interface with various memory modules. The function accepts multiple parameters to define the memory's properties and the controller's behavior. These parameters include timings (e.g., TRAS, TRCD, TREFI), address order, user interface mode, port configuration, the number of data query pins, memory type, memory density, and miscellaneous settings for DDR-type memories. Further parameters define calibration settings and tap delay values, essential for the successful operational interface between the controller and memory. Specific data port and mask sizes for the communicating ports are also included. As such, this module serves as a configurable and flexible interface between a higher-level system and the memory."
