    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a conditional statement within an encompassing block that is activated when the variable `WAYS` is equal to 3. The logic implemented therein will dictate the successive operation should this condition be met. The label `valid_bits_3ways` marks this specific block of code, enabling it to be referenced elsewhere in the larger RTL design."
