This block of code is responsible for the synchronization of wb_start_read signal to the rising edge of 'i_clk'. The implementation consists of a simple 'always' block which monitors the positive edge of 'i_clk'. When 'i_clk' exhibits a positive edge, the signal 'wb_start_read' gets latched on to 'wb_start_read_d1', thus achieving synchronization.
