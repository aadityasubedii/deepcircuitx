    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for enabling or disabling a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) functionality. The status of the FIFO is determined by the 5th bit (4th index as it's 0-based) of the UART Line Control Register High (uart_lcrh_reg). If the value of this bit is 1, the FIFO is enabled and if it's 0, the FIFO is disabled."
