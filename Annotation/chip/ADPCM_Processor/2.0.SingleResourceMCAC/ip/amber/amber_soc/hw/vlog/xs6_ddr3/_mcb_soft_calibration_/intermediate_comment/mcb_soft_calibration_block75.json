    "block_comment": "This block is used for synchronization control in a hardware design. It is implemented using conditional statements that determine the state based on the input signals. If the reset signal 'RST' is activated, 'CKE_Train' is set low. In case 'STATE' matches 'WAIT_FOR_UODONE' and 'MCB_UODONECAL' is active, or if the higher order bit of 'WAIT_200us_COUNTER' is set and 'MCB_UODONECAL' is inactive, it sets 'CKE_Train' high. In all other scenarios, 'CKE_Train' is set low. This could serve as a clock gating implementation and an automatic power-saving measure that deals with device inactivity."
