Comment: 
This Verilog block assigns signals and asserts a done signal. In detail, it binds the system clock behavior to `o_sys_clk`, resets the system through `rst0` as it takes the state of `i_brd_rst`, and assigns hard-coded `1` as the value of `calib_done_33mhz` signal, indicating completion of a 33MHz calibration process.
