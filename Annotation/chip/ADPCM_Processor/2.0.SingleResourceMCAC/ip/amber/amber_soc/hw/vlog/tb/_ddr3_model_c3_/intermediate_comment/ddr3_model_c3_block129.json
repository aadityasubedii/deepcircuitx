    "block_comment": "This code block performs a function called 'dq_timing_check' whenever the input 'dq_in[1]' changes value. The implementation utilizes an 'always' block in Verilog, indicating that the function 'dq_timing_check' will be executed any time a change is detected on the second bit of the 'dq_in' input. It is used primarily for ensuring proper timing and synchronization within the digital system."
