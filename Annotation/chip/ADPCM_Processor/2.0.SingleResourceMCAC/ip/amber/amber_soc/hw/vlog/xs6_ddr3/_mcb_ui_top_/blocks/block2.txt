This block of code aids in MCB (Memory Controller Block) interface synchronization and data read/write operations. The code employs two modules: `mcb_ui_top_synch`, used for synchronization of calibration done signal,  and `axi_mcb` which configures and implements the read/write operations on AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface). The configuration parameters for the AXI interface are specified and MCB options are set. Interface signal connections are established between the AXI bus and the AXI MCB module ensuring a smooth data transfer. Completing the operations, the synchronized calibration done signal is connected to the interface.
