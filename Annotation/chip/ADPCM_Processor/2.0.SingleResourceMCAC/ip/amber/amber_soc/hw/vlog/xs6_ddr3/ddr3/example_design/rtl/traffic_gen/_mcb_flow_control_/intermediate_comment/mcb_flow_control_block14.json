    "block_comment": "This line of code is assigning the input signal 'bl_i' to the output signal 'wr_bl_o'. Specifically, it is using Verilog's 'assign' statement, which continuously drive the 'wr_bl_o' with the value of 'bl_i'. Therefore, anytime a change occurs on the signal 'bl_i', the change will be instantly reflected on 'wr_bl_o'."
