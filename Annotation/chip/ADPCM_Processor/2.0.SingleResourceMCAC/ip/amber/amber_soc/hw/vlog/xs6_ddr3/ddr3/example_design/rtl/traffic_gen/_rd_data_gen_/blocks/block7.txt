Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for signalling the identification of the last word in a stream of data. It achieves its function by using a bitwise AND operation between the signal u_bcount_2 and data_rdy_i, both of which are inputs to the current block. u_bcount_2 is presumably a binary count, and data_rdy_i likely represents data readiness. Therefore, last_word_o will be assigned high only when u_bcount_2 and data_rdy_i are both high. This design implies that the last word is identified based on a particular state of the binary count when data is ready.
