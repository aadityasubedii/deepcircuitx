    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing the length of received wireless data (RxLength) in a LatchedRxLength memory register. The process is triggered on the rising edge of either the Reset signal or the MRxClk signal, a master receive clock. If the Reset signal is high, LatchedRxLength is reset to zero, otherwise, if LoadRxStatus is high, the current RxLength data is latched into the LatchedRxLength register."
