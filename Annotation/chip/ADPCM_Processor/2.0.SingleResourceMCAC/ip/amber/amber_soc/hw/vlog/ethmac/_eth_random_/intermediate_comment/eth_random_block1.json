    "block_comment": "The block generates a boolean signal, RandomEqByteCnt, to check if the ByteCnt is equal to both the latched random value (RandomLatched) and the bitwise AND reduction of NibCnt. This is achieved using an assignment ('assign') operation which equates RandomEqByteCnt to the result of the binary comparison operation. The bit slicing of ByteCnt and NibCnt is employed to accommodate matching index dimensions, promoting efficient hardware optimization."
