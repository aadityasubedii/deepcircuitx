Comment: 
This block of code generates a reset signal named 'rst_tmp'. It is implemented using a combinational logic which states that 'rst_tmp' will be active or 'high' only when both conditions are not met: when the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) is not in a 'locked' state as signaled by the 'PLL_LOCK_R2' being low, and when not in 'SELFREFRESH_MODE'. Therefore, 'rst_tmp' is a logical output of two input signals 'PLL_LOCK_R2' and 'SELFREFRESH_MODE'. In other words, 'rst_tmp' will be 'low' in case PLL is locked or the system is in self-refresh mode.
