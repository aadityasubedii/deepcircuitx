    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for detecting a positive edge in the 24th bit of 'dqs_in' signal and triggering the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function accordingly. This is achieved through the 'always' construct in Verilog which continually listens for changes in the signal's state (posedge in this case) and activates the implemented functions or procedures upon the occurrence of the specified event. Hence, function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' with '23' as an argument is called whenever there is a positive edge change detected on the 24th bit of 'dqs_in' signal.\n"
