    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates a function named `cmd_addr_timing_check` whenever there's a change in the second bit of `ba_in` input. This task is achieved by describing a sensitivity list within the `always` block for the second bit of `ba_in`, which will trigger the call to `cmd_addr_timing_check` with an argument of '5'."
