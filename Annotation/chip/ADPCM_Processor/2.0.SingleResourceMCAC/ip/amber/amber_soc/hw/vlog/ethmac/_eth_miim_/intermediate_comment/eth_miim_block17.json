    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code appears to be a synchronous sequential logic block that updates certain signal values upon each rising edge of a system clock (Clk) or a reset signal (Reset). It divides its operation between two modes: reset state and clocked operation. If a reset is detected, all status and control signals, such as 'WCtrlData_qi', 'RStat_qi' and 'ScanStat_qi', are set to '0', initializing the entire system to a known state. In normal operation (else block), each signal is delayed ie., 'WCtrlData' is passed to 'WCtrlData_q1' which is passed to 'WCtrlData_q2' and so on, creating a cascaded delay for signals. Moreover, 'ScanStat_q2' signal is only transferred to 'SyncStatMdcEn' if the condition 'MdcEn' is met, providing conditional synchronous behavior."
