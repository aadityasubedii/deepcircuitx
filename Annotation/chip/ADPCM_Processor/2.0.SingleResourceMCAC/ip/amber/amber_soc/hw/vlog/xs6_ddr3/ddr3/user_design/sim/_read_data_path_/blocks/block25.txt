This Verilog block is responsible for creating a pipeline of data delays. It achieves this through the sequential assignment of the `cmp_data` variable to `cmp_data_r`, `cmp_data_r2`, `cmp_data_r3`, and `cmp_data_r4` successively. These assignments are triggered on the rising edge of `clk_i` input signal, with each assignment delayed by a time period defined by `TCQ`. The delay ensures that the changes of `cmp_data` propagate through this sequence across several clock cycles, hence it acts as a 4-stage delay line.
