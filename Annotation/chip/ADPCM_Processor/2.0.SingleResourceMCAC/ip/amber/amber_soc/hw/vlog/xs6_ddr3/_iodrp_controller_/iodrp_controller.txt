Module-level comment: The 'iodrp_controller' module manages a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) using input commands and data, enabling efficient hardware reconfiguration during FPGA operation. It implements a finite state machine (FSM) to navigate through operational states, managing data shifting through a register, bit counting, and conditional state transitions. Input and output ports handle control signals, address, and data flow. Multiplexing, state encoding, and careful register operations ensure robust DRP control, while debugging registers provide readable state representation.
