    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns input signals from a master to slave 4 within a Wishbone system-on-chip interconnection protocol. Specifically, it assigns the address, data, and select input signals from the master to the corresponding signals of slave 4 directly, while write enable, cycle, and strobe signals are conditioned on whether the current slave being interacted with is slave 4, controlled by the 'current_slave' variable. If the 'current_slave' is 4, these respective signals are mapped to master signals, otherwise they are set to 0."
