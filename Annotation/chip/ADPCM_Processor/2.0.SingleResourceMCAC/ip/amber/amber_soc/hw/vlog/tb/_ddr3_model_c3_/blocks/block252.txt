This block of code initialises a string array, `cmd_string[]`, with command names related to memory operation in a system. Each command corresponds to an index, formatted in consistent length for easy reading, representing different operational modes like load, refresh, precharge, activate, write, read, impedance calibration (ZQ), no operation (NOP), power down, and self refresh. These strings can be used for display or debug print-outs to represent the state of the memory operation.
