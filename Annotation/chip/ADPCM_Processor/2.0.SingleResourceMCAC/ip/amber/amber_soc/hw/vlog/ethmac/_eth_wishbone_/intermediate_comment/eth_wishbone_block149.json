    "block_comment": "The block primarily functions as a flip-flop, a basic building block in digital circuit design, for an MTx data transmission module. It executes on the rising edge of the transmission clock (MTxClk) or a system reset (Reset). If the Reset signal or any of the transmission termination conditions (TxDone, TxAbort, or TxRetry_q) are triggered, it sets the state of the 'Flop' to 0. On the other hand, if the data is being used for transmission (TxUsedData), it toggles the state of 'Flop', leading to a binary counter-like operation."
