Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for creating a continuous assignment statement, which allows for real-time updates of the output signal `force_wrcmd_gen_o` based on changes in the input signal `force_wrcmd_gen`. When `force_wrcmd_gen` changes its value, the assignment statement is evaluated, and the new value is propagated to `force_wrcmd_gen_o`. This is a widely used design pattern in Verilog, effectively allowing for synchronization of two signals in hardware design.
