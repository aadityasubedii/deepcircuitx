    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a part of a synchronous digital system controlled by the clock signal (clk_i). The block defines the logic for controlling the readiness (cmd_rdyF) of some command based on different conditions. When a reset signal (rst_i[0]) is asserted, the command readiness becomes high. A similar scenario occurs if the command start (cmd_startF) is initiated and the bl_i signal is 1. Alternatively, the command readiness goes low if cmd_startF is triggered and bl_i is not 1. Finally, command readiness also goes high if the user_burst_cnt equals 2 and the FIFO buffer is not full. The time delay #TCQ is applied for all assignments of cmd_rdyF."
