    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block instance two modules: 'mcb_ui_top_synch' and 'axi_mcb' which are responsible for managing a memory controller bus (MCB) user interface and AXI interface respectively. The 'mcb_ui_top_synch' synchronises the 'done_cal' signal to the AXI clock and provides the 'calib_done_synch' output. Then the 'axi_mcb' is instantiated with several configuration parameters, binding its ports to various AXI interface signals and MCB interface signals. This includes signals for command, write, and read operations. Noteworthy is the handshaking mechanism of the AXI protocol that is respected in this code block where AXI master and slave acknowledge (valid/ready) performing write and read operations, ensuring data integrity and flow control."
