    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for setting the Read Transmit Data from Memory signal (`SetReadTxDataFromMemory`). It does this by performing a bitwise AND operation between the Transmit Enable (`TxEn`), the delayed version of Transmit Enable (`TxEn_q`), and the Transmit Pointer Read (`TxPointerRead`). If all of these signals are high, `SetReadTxDataFromMemory` is set high, otherwise, it remains low. This effectively sets the condition for reading transmit data from memory."
