    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `addr_counts` to `seq_addr`. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used for making continuous assignments, specifically, it's used to drive a wire with a continuous value, i.e., the value on the RHS (`addr_counts` in this case) is constantly evaluated and assigned to the LHS (`seq_addr` in this case). This operation indicates that `seq_addr` directly reflects any changes to `addr_counts` in real-time, maintaining the live mapping of the address count to sequence address in the circuitry."
