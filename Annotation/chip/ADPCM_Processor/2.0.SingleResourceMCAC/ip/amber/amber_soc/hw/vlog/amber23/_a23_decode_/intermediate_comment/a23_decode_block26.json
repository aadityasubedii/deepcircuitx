    "block_comment": "This is a control unit for a processor designed in Verilog. It determines the control signals which dictate data flow within the CPU in an instruction cycle. The block initializes various control and status variables to default values. Upon meeting the condition of a valid and non-interrupt instruction, it handles different operation types, determining the control flow for each. It respects opcode values for register operations, handles memory operations with conditions for pre and post index, defines the flow for multi transfer operations, handles multiply, SWAP, coprocessor transfer, software interrupt and undefined requests conditions. Lastly, it manages flags for register operations. These operations particularly concern instruction execution, memory access, data transfer, branching, SWAP operation and interrupt handling. The block defines this control flow by changing values of initialized statuses, control, arithmetic operations and data transfer signals for the next state based on the opcode of the given instruction."
