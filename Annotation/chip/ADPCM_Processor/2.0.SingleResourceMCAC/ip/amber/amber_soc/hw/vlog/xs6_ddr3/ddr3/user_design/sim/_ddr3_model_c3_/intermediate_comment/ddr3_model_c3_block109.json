    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates a timing check function using the 22nd bit of the incoming data word (dq_in) every time there's a change in it. In Verilog code, the 'always @' event control statement makes sure that the function 'dq_timing_check' is called each time when the 22nd bit of the data (dq_in[21]) changes its state. The function 'dq_timing_check' with the parameter 21 might be implemented elsewhere to perform the actual checking of the timing for incoming data."
