    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed as a counter that keeps track of the asked read data counts in a system. It is primarily driven by the positive edge of an input clock signal. During reset, it initializes the read data count to zero. However, in normal operation, whenever a command is enabled and the LSB of the command sent is 1, it increments the count of read data by the addition of the sent block length and a specified value. This facilitates efficient tracking of read counts in the coding system."
