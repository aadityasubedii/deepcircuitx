    "block_comment": "This code block acts as a delay mechanism for data named 'ba'. It makes use of the 'always' keyword to consider all changes to the input 'ba' and then establishes a time delay defined by the 'BUS_DELAY' macro. The enhancement is realized via a Verilog's non-blocking assignment represented by the \"<=\" symbol. The delay in execution of the assignment ensures synchronization of all operations in the context of a hardware description language, reducing the risk of hardware conflicts."
