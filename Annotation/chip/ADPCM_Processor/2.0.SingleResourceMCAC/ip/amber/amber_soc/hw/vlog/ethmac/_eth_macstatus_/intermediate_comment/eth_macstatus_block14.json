    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating the LoadRxStatus signal based on system reset or the sample input condition. On the rising edge of the MRxClk signal or the Reset signal, this block will act. If the Reset signal is set, LoadRxStatus is cleared or set to 0 after a delay 'Tp'. If the Reset signal is not set, LoadRxStatus is made equal to the TakeSample signal after the same delay 'Tp'."
