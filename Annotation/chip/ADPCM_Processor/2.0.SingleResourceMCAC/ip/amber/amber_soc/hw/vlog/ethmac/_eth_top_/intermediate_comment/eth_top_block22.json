    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code controls the logic of the MRxDV_Lb signal. The MRxDV_Lb signal is assigned one of the two values depending on the condition of the 'r_LoopBck' signal. When 'r_LoopBck' is true (high), MRxDV_Lb inherits the value from 'mtxen_pad_o' signal, which creates a loopback condition. When 'r_LoopBck' is false (low), MRxDV_Lb takes the value of the logical AND operation between 'mrxdv_pad_i' and 'RxEnSync', ensuring received data is valid and the receive operation is synchronized."
