    "block_comment": "This block is a memory write task in a memory model for Verilog. It takes bank, row, col, and data as inputs to calculate a memory address and store the data. The block first determines if \"MAX_MEM\" is defined. If so, it calculates the address by concatenating the row and col divided by a block size, and writes the data to a file associated with the specific bank. Otherwise, it forms the address based on the bank, row, and col values, performs a check for available memory space, records the address and data, and updates the memory usage counter. The block also handles overflow by providing an error message and stopping execution under specific conditions."
