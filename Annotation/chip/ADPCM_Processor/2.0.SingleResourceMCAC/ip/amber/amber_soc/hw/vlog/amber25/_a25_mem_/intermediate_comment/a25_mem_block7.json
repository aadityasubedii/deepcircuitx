    "block_comment": "This block is implementing a stall control signal in a fetch unit of a processor. The \"fetch_only_stall\" is assigned as true only when the fetch unit, indicated by \"i_fetch_stall\", is directed to stall and there is no concurrent stall in memory unit, signified by \"!o_mem_stall\". This facilitates independent fetch unit operation without the influence of the memory unit activity."
