    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is used to trigger the function 'cmd_addr_timing_check' with the parameter '8', whenever there is a change in the second least significant bit of the 'addr_in' signal. The 'always' keyword coupled with the '@' sign denotes a sensitivity list indicating that the proceeding block is to be executed if any of the signals in the list changes. In this case, the list contains only 'addr_in[1]'. This is a common pattern for creating edge-triggered behavior in hardware description languages."
