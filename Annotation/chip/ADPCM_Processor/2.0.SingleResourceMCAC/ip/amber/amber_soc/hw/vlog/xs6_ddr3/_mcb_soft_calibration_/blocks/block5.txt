Comment: 
This Verilog RTL code block is responsible for updating the maximum value and controlling the first input terminal. When the specified condition is met, the maximum value ('Max_Value') is assigned the value of the 'IODRPCTRLR_READ_DATA'. In addition, if the 'First_In_Term_Done' flag is not set ('~' denotes logical NOT in Verilog), it enters another control flow block, signifying that the action concerning the first input terminal isn't completed yet.
