Comment: 
This block schedules execution of the `dq_timing_check` function for any change in the 41st bit of the `dq_in` signal. Whenever there is a change of state in the 41st position of `dq_in`, this block gets triggered and calls the `dq_timing_check` function with parameter '40'. This is accomplished through a synchronous `always @` block, making this block sensitive to changes around rising or falling edges of `dq_in[40]` signal, thereby enabling the `dq_timing_check` function to maintain the timing integrity of `dq_in[40]`.
