    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for managing the state of three transmissions status signals (TxDone_wb_q, TxAbort_wb_q, TxRetry_wb_q) relative to the 'WB_CLK_I' clock signal and a 'Reset' signal. Implemented using an always block in Verilog, it resets the status signals to zero when a positive edge of the 'Reset' signal is detected, and otherwise updates the status signals with the corresponding input values (TxDone_wb, TxAbort_wb, TxRetry_wb) on the positive edge of the 'WB_CLK_I' clock signal,  simulating synchronous digital circuit behavior."
