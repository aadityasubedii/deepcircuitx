Comment: 
The given block of code is used for incrementing the byte count under specific conditions in a transmission system. Using Bitwise AND and OR, these conditions include instances where a control multiplexer (`CtrlMux`) is triggered while a transmission control frame (`TxCtrlStartFrm`) begins and the past control frame (`TxCtrlStartFrm_q`) didn't begin without data in the used data overlay (`TxUsedDataIn`) or when there's data in the overlay and control end (`ControlEnd`) hasn't been hit. If these conditions are met, then the byte count increase (`IncrementByteCnt`) is done.
