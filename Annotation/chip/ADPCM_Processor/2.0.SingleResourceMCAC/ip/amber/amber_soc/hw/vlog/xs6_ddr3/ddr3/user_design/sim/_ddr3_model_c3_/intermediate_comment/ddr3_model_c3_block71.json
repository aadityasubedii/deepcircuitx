    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to invoke the `dq_timing_check` function whenever there is a change on the 60th bit (index 59) of the `dq_in` signal. The operation here is event-driven, such that the function call is triggered by a change (either a 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transition) on the specified bit of `dq_in`, ensuring that the timing properties of this specific bit are validated whenever it updates."
