Comment: 
This block manages read data count on a positive edge trigger. When the data input and validation flag is high (instr_vld_dly1) and the 33rd bit (pipe_data_in[32]) of the incoming data is 1, it increments the value of rd_data_counts_asked by 64, if bits 36 to 41(pipe_data_in[40:35]) of the data are 0; otherwise, it increases by the value of bits 36 to 41. The block will be reset on the high value of the first bit of the reset input (rst_i[0]).
