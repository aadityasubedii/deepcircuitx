    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic that enables comparison data based on a given input. Upon a positive edge of the input clock signal (clk_i), it assigns with a delay (reflecting Timing Control Queue, TCQ) the 'data_rdy' status value to 'cmp_data_en'. This effectively realizes a flip-flop behavior to control when comparison data should be enabled for downstream processing."
