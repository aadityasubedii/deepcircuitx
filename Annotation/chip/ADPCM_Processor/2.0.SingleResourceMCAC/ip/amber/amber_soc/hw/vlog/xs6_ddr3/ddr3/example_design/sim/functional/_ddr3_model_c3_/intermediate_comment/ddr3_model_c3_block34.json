    "block_comment": "This block initiates the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function at the falling edge of the 32nd element of the `dqs_in` array. The negedge trigger allows this function to be called any time there's a change from high voltage to low voltage in `dqs_in[31]`, providing a means to verify DQS (Data Strobe) timing in a DDR (Double Data Rate) context."
