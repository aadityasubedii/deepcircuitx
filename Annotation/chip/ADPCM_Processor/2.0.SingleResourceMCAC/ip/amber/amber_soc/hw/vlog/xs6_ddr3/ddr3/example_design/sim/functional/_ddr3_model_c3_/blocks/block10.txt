This block of code triggers timing check on signal 'dqs_in[22]' at every positive edge of the clock cycle. It utilizes an 'always' keyword to implement synchronous logic and sets an event-driven procedure on the detection of the positive edge of 'dqs_in[22]', which then invokes the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check(22)'.
