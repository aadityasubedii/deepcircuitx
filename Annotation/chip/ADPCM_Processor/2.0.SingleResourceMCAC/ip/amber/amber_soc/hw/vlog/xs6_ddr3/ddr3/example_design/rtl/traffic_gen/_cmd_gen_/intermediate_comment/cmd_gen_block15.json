    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing a read count under specific conditions. The counting procedure is synchronous with the positive edge of the system's clock signal. When the fifth element of the rst_i input is high (indicating a reset condition), the read count (force_rd_counts) is immediately set to zero. On the other hand, if the reset is not activated and the instr_vld signal is high (indicating that an instruction is valid), the read count is incremented by one, after a delay defined by the constant TCQ (Technology Clock to Q delay). Compliance to the said delay ensures that the read count update adheres to the involved technology's timing constraints."
