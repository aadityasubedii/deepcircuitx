    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is concerned with monitoring changes in the 23rd bit of the 'dq_in' input array. Upon any change in the 'dq_in[22]' bit, the function 'dq_timing_check' with the integer argument '22' is called, allowing for event-driven checks of timing issues specifically related to the 23rd bit of 'dq_in'.\n"
