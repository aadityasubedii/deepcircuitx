    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for synchronizing the reading of Tx data from a FIFO memory. This synchronization is achieved by a dual-edge trigger, that acts upon the rising edge of WB_CLK_I signal or upon the rising edge of the Reset signal. When a Reset signal occurs, the `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync2` variable is cleared, else the `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync2` variable adopts the value of `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync1`."
