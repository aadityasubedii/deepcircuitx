Comment: 
The block assigns a relevant state name to the `xC_STATE` variable based on the current state of the `c_state` variable. Using conditional operators `?` and `:` (ternary operators), the block checks if `c_state` corresponds to one of the enumerated states (like `CS_INIT`, `CS_IDLE`, `CS_FILL1`, etc.), and if so, assigns the corresponding string label to `xC_STATE`. In case `c_state` doesn't match any of the listed states, it assigns the string `"UNKNOWN"` to `xC_STATE` as a default.
