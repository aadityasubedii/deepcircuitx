Comment: 
This block initializes some parameters for a dual-port SRAM (SRAM3) for a Spartan6 device. The parameters include data width for each port (36 bits), and both ports are not registered since DOA_REG and DOB_REG are set to 0. The SRAM doesn't use any reset value, and initialization values for the memory locations are defined by the SRAM3_INIT hex values. Initial values are by default 36'h000000000 for both ports and write operations are executed before read ('WRITE_FIRST'). The collision checks during simulations will generate X only. The type of reset used is synchronous ("SYNC"), and the priority for reset is given to the Clock Enable signal ("CE") for both ports.
