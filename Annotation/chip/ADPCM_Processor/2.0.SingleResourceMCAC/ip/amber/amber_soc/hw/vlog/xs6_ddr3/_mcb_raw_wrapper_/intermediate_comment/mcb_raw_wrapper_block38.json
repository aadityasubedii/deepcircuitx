    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a counter that resets at a given `int_sys_rst` signal and increments with every positive edge of `ui_clk`. When the signal `int_sys_rst` is high, the 200-microsecond wait counter resets. If not, and the 15th bit of the counter is high (indicating that the counter has reached its upper limit), the counter holds its value. Otherwise, it increments by 1 at each clock edge."
