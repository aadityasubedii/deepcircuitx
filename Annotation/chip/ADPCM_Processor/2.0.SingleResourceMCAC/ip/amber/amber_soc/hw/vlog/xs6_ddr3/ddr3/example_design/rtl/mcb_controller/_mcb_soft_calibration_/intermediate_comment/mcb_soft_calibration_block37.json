    "block_comment": "This block of code acts as a finite state machine transition that waits until the memory controller bank (MCB) is not busy before proceeding to the next state. If the MCB is busy (MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is negative), the state remains as LDQS_PIN_P_TERM_WAIT. However, once the memory controller bank is ready (MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is positive), the state transitions to LDQS_PIN_WRITE_N_TERM, signaling that it is ready to write a negative termination operation. This implementation utilizes a simple if-else conditional statement to determine the state transitions of the finite state machine, ensuring streamlined hardware control flow."
