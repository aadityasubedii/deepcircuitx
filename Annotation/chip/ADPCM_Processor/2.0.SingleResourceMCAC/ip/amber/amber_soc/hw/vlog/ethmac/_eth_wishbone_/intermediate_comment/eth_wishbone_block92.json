    "block_comment": "This block of code governs a transmission retry mechanism. If there is a system reset, the `TxRetryPacket` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the `TxRetryPacket` value will be set to 1 when a transmission retry occurs under specific conditions: When `TxRetry_wb` is on, `tx_burst_en` is off, `MasterWbTX` is on, `MasterAccessFinished` is on, and `TxRetryPacketBlocked` is off; or when `TxRetry_wb` is on, `MasterWbTX` is off, and `TxRetryPacketBlocked` is off. If none of these conditions are met, the `TxRetryPacket` will be reset to 0."
