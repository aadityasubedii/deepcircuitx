Comment: 
The block is responsible for converting internal machine state values to human-readable ASCII strings. Based on the current active 'state', a corresponding ASCII string assignment is conducted to the 'state_ascii' variable. The whole process is sensitive to changes in the 'state' variable, which triggers the always block to execute. The conversion is facilitated by a case statement which maps each possible 'state' to an explicit string representation.
