Comment: 
This Verilog block controls the output `bl_out` under the rising edge of clock input `clk_i`. If `mode_load_pulse` signal is high, `bl_out` is set to `fixed_bl_i` after a delay of time `TCQ`. Alternatively, when the `cmd_clk_en` command clock is enabled but `mode_load_pulse` is low, `bl_out` is determined by a case statement based on `bl_mode_reg` - it could be either `bram_bl_i`, `fixed_bl_i`, `prbs_brlen`, or `6'h1` depending on whether `bl_mode_reg` is 0, 1, 2 or any other value respectively. This value assignment also experiences a delay of `TCQ`. This block essentially multiplexes `bl_out` depending on the control inputs.
