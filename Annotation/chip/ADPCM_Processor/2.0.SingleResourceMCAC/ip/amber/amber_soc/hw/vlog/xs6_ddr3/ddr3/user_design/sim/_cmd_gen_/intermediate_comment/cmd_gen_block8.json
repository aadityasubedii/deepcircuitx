    "block_comment": "This block of code pertains to pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generation for two different instructions types \"instr_prbs_gen_a\" and \"instr_prbs_gen_b\". If the command pattern is either \"CGEN_PRBS\" or \"CGEN_ALL\", the PRBS generation module, `cmd_prbs_gen`, is instantiated twice, each with its own set of parameters and inputs/outputs. The module taps into a specified clock signal (`clk_i`) and is enabled when `cmd_clk_en` is true. For each instantiation, the seed values for the PRBS generator are loaded from the 15-bit signals `cmd_seed_i[14:0]` and `cmd_seed_i[16:2]` respectively. The 20-bit PRBS outputs are `prbs_instr_a` and `prbs_instr_b`. The generate-if construct in Verilog enables these instances to be created dynamically based on the command patterns."
