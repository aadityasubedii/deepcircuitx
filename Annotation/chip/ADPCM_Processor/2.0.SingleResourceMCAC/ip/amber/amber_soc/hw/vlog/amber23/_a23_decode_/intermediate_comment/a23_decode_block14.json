    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily handles the swapping of data under certain conditions. It achieves this by employing a barrel shift operation whose parameters are selected based on the 'control_state' and 'i_execute_address' bits. It defines the shift operation and amount based on the current state and the 'i_execute_address' lower two bits. During the execution of the instruction, next address type and program counter write enable signal are defined. Furthermore, the 'alu_out_sel_nxt' value is also set based on the 22nd bit of the instruction. In case of absence of data abort, the block sets the address selection source and the register to be written into based on instruction\u2019s bits or sets specific values if special conditions are met."
