Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for assigning the received 128-bit data from the wishbone interface to the output wire 'o_wb_dat'. It employs the 'assign' keyword used in Verilog which indicates continuous assignment. The statement will always drive the 'o_wb_dat' with the value of 'wb_rdata128'. This assignment occurs regardless of any clock signals, enabling real-time data transfer.
