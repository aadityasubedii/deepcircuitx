    "block_comment": "This block modifies the h_prbsdata array based on the SEL_VICTIM_LINE index. It traverses through the h_prbsdata array with a loop, and checks if the current index is the SEL_VICTIM_LINE or N*num of SEL_VICTIM_LINE. If it is, it assigns the value from full_prbs_data[SEL_VICTIM_LINE] to h_prbsdata[i] and if it doesn't match any of the conditions, it assigns the value from hdata[i] to h_prbsdata[i]. This way it fills up the h_prbsdata array based on the full_prbs_data and hdata arrays."
