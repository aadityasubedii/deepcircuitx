    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to set the 'rdy_busy_n' signal based on the current state of the system. Specifically, if the system is in the 'READY' state, the 'rdy_busy_n' signal will be set true. This is achieved through the use of the assignment operator in Verilog, which constantly checks for changes to the 'state' value and updates 'rdy_busy_n' accordingly."
