    "module": "Module-level comment: The rd_data_gen Verilog module is responsible for scalable data generation and read operations, customizable via input parameters such as data width, address width, burst length, and FPGA family (SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6). The module operates based on configurable input signals and generates output data alongside necessary control signals. Internal signals are used for managing state, data and control flows with changes tracked synchronously with an internal clock signal. Depending on the FPGA family, the module instantiates a SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6 data generator (shown as SP6_DGEN and V6_DGEN blocks). Data continuity and synchronization are achieved through pipelining, enabling efficient timing and operational control."
