    "block_comment": "The block of code acts as a trigger for a 'dqs_odd_receiver' function upon every positive edge of 'dqs_odd' with index 11. The implementation relies on 'always' for continuously monitoring the particular 'dqs_odd' bit. Whenever a positive transition occurs, the 'dqs_odd_receiver' function gets called with 11 as an argument, which presumably processes the change in 'dqs_odd'."
