    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code performs a logical shift right (LSR) operation. It assigns output variables based on certain conditions. The first output line assigns the logical AND operation of 'p_r[31]' and 'lsr_mask[31]' to 'lsr_out[0]'. The second output line assigns different values to 'lsr_out[1]' based on certain condition checks: when 'i_shift_imm_zero' is true, 'i_in[31]' is assigned, when 'shift_nzero' is true, the AND operation of 'p_r[31]' and 'lsr_mask[32]' is assigned, otherwise 'i_carry_in' is assigned."
