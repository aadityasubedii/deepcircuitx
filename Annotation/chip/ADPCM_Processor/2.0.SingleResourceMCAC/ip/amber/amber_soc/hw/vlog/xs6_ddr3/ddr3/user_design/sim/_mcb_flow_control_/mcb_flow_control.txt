Module-level comment: The module 'mcb_flow_control' manages a memory controller block in FPGAs, queuing and executing memory operation commands like read, write, and refresh. It utilizes a finite state machine to handle transitions based on various inputs. Inputs include command validation, type, address details, and info about the bank and burst length. Outputs involve processed command, registered addresses, and validation of write or read data paths. Internal signals are used to flag command stages, show read/write data status, and represent the FSM's state transitions. Input-Output behaviours and state transitions are handled by the always block and case statement in the code.
