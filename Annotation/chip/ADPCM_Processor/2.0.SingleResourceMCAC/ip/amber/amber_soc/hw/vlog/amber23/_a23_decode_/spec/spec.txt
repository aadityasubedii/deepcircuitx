Module name: a23_decode. Module specification: The a23_decode module is responsible for decoding instructions for an ARM processor. It takes various input signals, including clock (i_clk), instruction data (i_read_data), interrupt requests (i_irq, i_firq), abort signals (i_dabt, i_iabt, i_adex), execution address (i_execute_address), and status bits (i_execute_status_bits). The module generates numerous output signals to control other parts of the processor, such as register selection (o_rm_sel, o_rds_sel, o_rn_sel), ALU and barrel shifter control (o_alu_function, o_barrel_shift_function), status bits control (o_status_bits_sel), and memory access control (o_write_data_wen, o_byte_enable_sel).
