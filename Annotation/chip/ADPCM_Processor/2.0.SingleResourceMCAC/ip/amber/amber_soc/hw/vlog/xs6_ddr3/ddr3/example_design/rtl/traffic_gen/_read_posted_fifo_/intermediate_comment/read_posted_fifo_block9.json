    "block_comment": "This block of code is involved in generating a delayed version of an input signal. On every rising edge of the clock signal (`clk_i`), it assigns the value of the input `data_valid_i` to the `data_valid_r` register after a delay defined by the constant `#TCQ`. This mechanism can be useful for synchronization or de-bouncing activities in digital systems."
