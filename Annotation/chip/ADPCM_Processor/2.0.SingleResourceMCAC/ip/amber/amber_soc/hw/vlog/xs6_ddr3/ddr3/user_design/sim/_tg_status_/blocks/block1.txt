Comment: 
This block of code essentially manages error detection and status reporting in a digital system. This is accomplished through the use of appropriate scanning and trigger events, in addition to utilizing a clock signal for synchronization. When a reset or manual error clear signal is detected, the block reinitializes the error status and reset flags. However, if these signals are not detected, the block checks for a data error. If an error is present and wasn't previously set, the block captures the error details such as address, block length, full command buffer, write/read buffer status, comparison and read data, and sets the error flag. Finally, it continuously zeroes out some bits in the error status for clearer error reports.
