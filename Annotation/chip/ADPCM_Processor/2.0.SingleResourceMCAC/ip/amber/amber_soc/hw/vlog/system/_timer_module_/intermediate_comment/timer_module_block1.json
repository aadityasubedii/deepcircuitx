    "block_comment": "This block of code acts as an interrupt service routine for three timer modules. It operates on a rising edge clock signal, wherein the states of three timers 'timer0_int_reg', 'timer1_int_reg', 'timer2_int_reg' are latched at 'timer0_int_reg_d1', 'timer1_int_reg_d1' and 'timer2_int_reg_d1' respectively. The display calls are triggered when the present state of the timer is active and the past state wasn't, indicating an interrupt event on each timer, which then prints out a debug message for the corresponding timer module.\n"
