    "block_comment": "The block is used for pull-down and pull-up operations on DRAM data strobe signals depending on memory type. If the memory type (`C_MEM_TYPE`) is DDR, MDDR, or DDR2 (with `C_MEM_DDR2_DIFF_DQS_EN` condition as \"NO\"), then only a pull-down operation on the data strobe (`mcbx_dram_dqs`) is executed. However, if the memory type does not satisfy this condition, both a pull-down operation on the data strobe and a pull-up operation on the negated data strobe (`mcbx_dram_dqs_n`) are executed."
