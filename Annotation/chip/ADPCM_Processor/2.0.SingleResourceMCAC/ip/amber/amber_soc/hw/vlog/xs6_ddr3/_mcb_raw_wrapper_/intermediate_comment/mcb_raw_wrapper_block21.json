    "block_comment": "The block of code represents an instantiation of an OSERDES2 (serializer/deserializer) module, which primarily acts as a data transmission interface for high-speed communication. The parameters of the instantiated module configure it with bypass enabled for the GCLK flip flop, specified data rates for OQ (output) and OT (tristate output), output mode set to single ended, in master mode operation and a data width of 2. Furthermore, the block links to input-output ports, most of which are defined with a constant bit of zero or one, except for 'IOCLOCK0' as input clock, 'IOI_CK' & 'T_CK' as output signals and the enable controls 'IOCE' and 'OCE'."
