This block of code acts as an error checker specifically for the configuration "R32" of port 3 when a command is enabled. The process runs continuously to monitor particular command instructionsâ€”the code ensures that both p3_cmd_instr[2] and p3_cmd_instr[0] are not both '0' simultaneously, as this indicates an invalid command for a read-only port. If this occurs, it displays an error message and terminates the script execution.
