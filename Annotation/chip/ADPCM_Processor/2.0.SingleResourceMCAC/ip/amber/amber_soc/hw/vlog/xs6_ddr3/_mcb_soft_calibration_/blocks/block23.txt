This block of code drives the Memory Controller Block (MCB) command valid signal and manages state transitions within the DDR memory interface system. It leverages the ready-busy signal from the MCB to control transitions between waiting states and writing states for the termination of the calibration and timing process for Udqs_Clk signal. If the MCB is ready, it transitions to a state of writing the P-term, otherwise, it stays in the wait state. Furthermore, it ensures that the system remains in the wait state until the MCB flags it's ready to proceed.
