    "module": "Module-level comment: The module 'eth_shiftreg' acts as an Ethernet Shift Register, processing input signals to deliver pertinent outputs. It achieves this through a series of conditional branches based upon 'MdcEn_n', which decide the course of operations against 'ShiftReg', 'Prsd', and 'LinkFail'. Additionally, it employs case operations for different 'ByteSelect' values, and utilizes 'LatchByte' to manipulate data bytes. It also provisions for full register reset and allocation of the most significant bit from 'ShiftReg' to 'ShiftedBit'. The module ensures specific Ethernet operations' execution and flagging any link failure."
