    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the increment counts in a memory module for different sizes of data pins, using a clock edge to apply changes. Depending on the number of data queue pins (`NUM_DQ_PINS`), the increment counts (`INC_COUNTS`) are set to different values multiplied by one fourth of the memory burst interval (`MEM_BURST_INT`). The delay is specified with `#TCQ`. For ranges 128-144, 64-128, 32-64 the increment count is set to 64, 32, 16 times the `MEM_BURST_INT/4` respectively. For exact pin counts 16, 24, and 8, it's set to 8 and 4 times the `MEM_BURST_INT/4` respectively."
