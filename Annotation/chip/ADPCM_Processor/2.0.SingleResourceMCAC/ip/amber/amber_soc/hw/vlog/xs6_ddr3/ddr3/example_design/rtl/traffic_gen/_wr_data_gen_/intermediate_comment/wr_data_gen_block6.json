    "block_comment": "This block is a clocked process that handles a command readiness flag (cmd_rdyE) based on different conditions. It employs various control signals for setting cmd_rdyE. At the rising edge of the clock (clk_i), it checks for a reset condition (rst_i[0]), and if true, it sets cmd_rdyE to high using an arbitrary delay #TCQ. If not in reset, it checks if a command has started (cmd_startE), and as per the status of bl_i, either sets or resets cmd_rdyE. Lastly, if the user_burst_cnt is equal to 2 and fifo is not full, it sets cmd_rdyE high."
