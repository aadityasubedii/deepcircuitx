    "block_comment": "This block of code is a Verilog module, `u_ethmac_wb`, that interacts with a wishbone bus (WB). The interaction is mainly divided into master (m) and slave (s) operations. Interfacing is performed by instantiating the `ethmac_wb` module with specific Wishbone data (WB_DWIDTH) and select width (WB_SWIDTH). Master operations involve reading from (acknowledgement - m_wb_ack and data - m_wb_rdat) and writing to the Wishbone bus (address - m_wb_adr, data - m_wb_wdat, write enable - m_wb_we, cycle - m_wb_cyc, strobe - m_wb_stb). Likewise, the slave operations facilitate reading (address - s_wb_adr, data - s_wb_rdat, selection - s_wb_sel, write enable - s_wb_we, cycle - s_wb_cyc, strobe - s_wb_stb) and writing (data - s_wb_dat_w, acknowledgement - s_wb_ack) to the Wishbone bus. The operation is duplicated for the extended master (emm) and extended slave (ems) Wishbone interfaces. Error signals (m_wb_err, s_wb_err, emm_wb_err, ems_wb_err) are generated in case of any interface errors."
