    "block_comment": "This block generates a start condition to initiate a receive operation for a frame of data (`GenerateRxStartFrm`). This is achieved through a combination of Boolean logic and comparison operations. When `StateData[0]` is true AND either `ByteCntEq1` is true and `DlyCrcEn` is false OR `DlyCrcCnt` equals '3 (in hexadecimal) and `DlyCrcEn` is true, the block triggers the beginning of a frame receiving operation in the system. It reflects the fact that the starting condition depends on several flags and counters within the system."
