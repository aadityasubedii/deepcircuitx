Module name: generic_sram_byte_en. 

Module specification: The generic_sram_byte_en module emulates a piece of RAM memory with byte-enable functionality which is driven by input clock signal i_clk. The module uses two parameters, DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH, which represent the width of stored data and the number of addresses, respectively. The inputs to the module include i_clk, i_write_data of width DATA_WIDTH, i_write_enable, i_address of width ADDRESS_WIDTH, and i_byte_enable with the size of DATA_WIDTH/8. The input i_clk serves as the clock signal that drives read and write operations. The data to be written into the memory is provided through the i_write_data port. Simultaneously, the i_write_enable serves as a control signal to allow data writing into memory. The desired location for reading or writing data in memory is indicated by the i_address port. The byte-enable operations for individual bytes within the data written to the memory are managed through the i_byte_enable signal. The output from the module is the data read from the specific memory address which is held at zero when enabled for writing. This data is provided through the o_read_data port.

Internal to the module, we have a memory representation mem of width DATA_WIDTH with entries equal to 2**ADDRESS_WIDTH. This serves as the storage core of the emulated RAM. Also, there's an integer variable 'i' which acts as a loop counter in memory write operations. The module operates in synchronization with the rising edge of the clock signal i_clk. When writing is enabled, data is written byte-wise for each byte of data according to the byte-enable signal. When not enabled for writing, the module reads data from the specified memory address and presents it at the o_read_data port output.
