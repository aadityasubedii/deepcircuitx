Module-level comment: 
/* 
This module implements a DDR3 memory controller interface. It configures and 
instantiates a memory controller core to interface with DDR3 SDRAM, providing 
multiple command, write, and read ports. The module handles clock generation, 
reset signals, and memory access through configurable parameters and ports, 
while managing internal signals for clock, reset, and debugging functions.
