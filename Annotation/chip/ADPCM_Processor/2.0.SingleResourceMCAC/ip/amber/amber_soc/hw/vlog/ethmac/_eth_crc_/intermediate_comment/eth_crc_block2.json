    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) in a synchronous reset design with a delayed, conditional update to detect errors in digital data. When system reset or initialization occurs, CRC is set to hexadecimal FFFFFFFF implying an immediate correction. For any other case, the CRC is updated in the next clock period to the value stored in CrcNext, which is likely computed elsewhere in the program."
