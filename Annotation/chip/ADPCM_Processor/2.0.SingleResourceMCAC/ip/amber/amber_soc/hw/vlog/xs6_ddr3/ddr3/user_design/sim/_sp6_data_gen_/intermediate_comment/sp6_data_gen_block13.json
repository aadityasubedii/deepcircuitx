    "block_comment": "The block conditions data writes according to various control signals and addresses. On a reset or positive edge of clock, either writes zero or validates the readiness of a FIFO and amount of user data. The operations within cases depend on the command status and the number of DQ pins. When the number of pins is 16, and the command status is true, it selectively writes to the 'w1data' memory, based on the given addresses using case statements. Various portions of the memory are written with different #TCQ delays. If not in command mode, an interleaving of data stream in 'w1data' deploys depending on the 'data_mode_i'. Similar operations are carried out when the number of pins is 8 or 4 but with adjustments on data handling--specifically on shifts and masking operations."
