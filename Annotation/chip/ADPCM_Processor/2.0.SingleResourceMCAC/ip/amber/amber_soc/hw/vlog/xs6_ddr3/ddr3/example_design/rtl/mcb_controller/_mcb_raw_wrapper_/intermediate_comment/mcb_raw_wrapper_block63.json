    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is used as part of a configuration for a memory interface generator (MIG), specifically handling configuration settings for writing and reading statuses for the third port. When the third port in enabled, it sets the MIG write and read controls, statuses and errors according to the current values from the third port's outputs. However, if the third port is not enabled, all the write related controls, statuses and errors are assigned to zero. In both conditions, all the read related statuses and errors are set to zero, indicating no reading is being performed."
