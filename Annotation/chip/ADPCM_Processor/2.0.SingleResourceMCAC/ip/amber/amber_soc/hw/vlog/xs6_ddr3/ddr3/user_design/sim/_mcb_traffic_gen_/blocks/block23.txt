Comment: 
This block of code is a counter for read data transactions. It performs its counting operation each time a positive edge of the clock signal is detected. When the reset line (`dcount_rst`) is active, the counter (`rd_data_counts`) is set to zero. In the case that the read enable (`mcb_rd_en_o`) line is asserted and the reset signal is not active, the counter is incremented by the value of the data width divided by eight. Targets a typical-case timing constraint specifically pacing the data transfer rate to the memory controller.
