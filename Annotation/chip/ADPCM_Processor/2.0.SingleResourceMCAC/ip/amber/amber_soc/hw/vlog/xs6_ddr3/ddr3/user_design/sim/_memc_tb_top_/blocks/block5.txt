Comment: 
The given block of code conditionally maps the commands from various ports (P0 - P5) to others (P2 - P5) based on whether each port is enabled or not and its mode (read or write). If a port is enabled and in "RD_MODE", its commands (enable, instruction, address, block, and write enable signals) are directed based on the enablement and mode of other ports. If the first two ports (P0 and P1) are enabled, the commands of any active, enabled and "RD_MODE" port mirror the commands of either P0 or P1. If ports P2 - P5 are enabled and in "WR_MODE", the active port's commands mirror the commands of the enabled "WR_MODE" port. If none of these conditions meet, the port's commands directly assign to itself. If the active port is in "WR_MODE", its commands are also assigned to itself.
