Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL assigns the 8th bit of the Random array. If the Retry Counter (RetryCnt) exceeds 7, the 8th bit of Random is set with the value of the 8th bit of array x; otherwise, it is set to zero. This is achieved using a conditional operator (?:), also known as a ternary operator, a compact way of expressing conditional assignments in Verilog.
