    "block_comment": "This block handles the control of the 'hdata' signal, which is updated on each rising edge of clock signal 'clk_i'. The block first checks if the reset signal 'rst_i' is active, in which case 'hdata' is reset to zero with an associated delay defined by #TCQ. Further, in case of fifo ready signal 'fifo_rdy_i' being high or the starting of command 'cmd_startC', 'hdata' is updated based on the value of 'NUM_DQ_PINS'. For 'NUM_DQ_PINS' of 16, 8, and 4, it sets different default hexadecimal values to the 'hdata' signal with a clock delay."
