This block of code controls the selection, data, and address assignments for a write buffer in a hardware design. If the write buffer is identified as ready (`write_buf_r`), it assigns the values from the respective read buffer variables (`wb_sel_buf_r`, `wb_dat_buf_r`, `wb_adr_buf_r`). If the write buffer is not ready, it assigns the inputs (`i_wb_sel`, `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_adr`) to these variables instead. This conditional assignment allows the buffer to load data effectively and manage its reading and writing operations in an optimized manner.
