Comment: 
This line of code is responsible for generating write back acknowledge signal (`o_wb_ack`). It is implemented using an assignment operation in Verilog which assigns value to `o_wb_ack` based on the logical AND operation result between the write back strobe input signal (`i_wb_stb`) and the OR operation result of the write back start write signal (`wb_start_write`) and the delayed signal for write back start read (`wb_start_read_d1`). This means that `o_wb_ack` will be true only if `i_wb_stb` is true and either `wb_start_write` or `wb_start_read_d1` is true.
