This block of code defines the asynchronous reset behavior or the conditional behavior of the TxCtrlEndFrm signal based on the MTxClk (Master Transmit Clock) and TxReset signal. Specifically, it is triggered on the rising edge of the MTxClk or TxReset. If TxReset is high, the TxCtrlEndFrm signal is set to low with a delay of Tp time units. In the absence of TxReset, if either the ControlEnd or ControlEnd_q flags are active, the TxCtrlEndFrm signal is set to high also with a delay of Tp time units, otherwise, it retains the low setting. This ensures the TxCtrlEndFrm signal's state is determined based on the specified conditions.
