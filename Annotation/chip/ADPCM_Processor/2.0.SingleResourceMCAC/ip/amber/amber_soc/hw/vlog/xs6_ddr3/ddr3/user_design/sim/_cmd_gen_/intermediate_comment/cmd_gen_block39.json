    "block_comment": "The block resets and increments read data received counters. Each time a rising edge of the system clock (clk_i) is detected, it checks if the reset input (rst_i[0]) is true. If so, it sets both 'rd_data_received_counts' and 'rd_data_received_counts_total' to zero. Otherwise, it checks if data reading operation 'reading_rd_data_i' is happening. If yes, it increments both 'rd_data_received_counts' and 'rd_data_received_counts_total' by one."
