    "block_comment": "The block represents a simple hardware register that holds the value of the `i_cmd_full` input pin. This is achieved by a clocked process, which updates the `cmd_full_r` register on the rising edge (`posedge`) of the clock signal (`i_clk`). The input command full (`i_cmd_full`) is thereby copied into the `cmd_full_r` register whenever there's a clock event."
