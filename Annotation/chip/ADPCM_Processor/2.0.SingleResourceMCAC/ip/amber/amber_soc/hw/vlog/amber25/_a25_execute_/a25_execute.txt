Module-level comment: This module implements the execute stage of an ARM processor pipeline. It performs instruction execution, ALU operations, register reads/writes, and status flag management. The module integrates components like ALU, barrel shifter, multiplier, and register bank to process instructions based on various control signals. It handles conditional execution, interrupt processing, and memory access operations, outputting results and control signals for subsequent pipeline stages.
