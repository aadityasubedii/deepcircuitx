    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block writes data to specific bytes in a word based on the set byte-enable bits. It merges the currently read data and the data to be written, constructing the data word to be written. The byte-enable value (i_byte_enable) will determine which bytes from the incoming write data are to be merged with the existing word. The positions for merging are selected using bit-slicing and concatenation operators. If none of the predefined byte-enable values match, the block will default to assigning the entire incoming write data to the output word."
