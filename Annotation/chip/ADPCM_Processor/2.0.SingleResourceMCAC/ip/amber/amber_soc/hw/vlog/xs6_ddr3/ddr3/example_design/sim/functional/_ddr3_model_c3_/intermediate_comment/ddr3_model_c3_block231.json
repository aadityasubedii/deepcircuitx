    "block_comment": "This code block assigns a value to the signal named `tdqs_n`. `tdqs_n` is defined as a vector of uncertain logic states (`1'bz`), with the length of the vector being `DQS_BITS`. This effectively initializes `tdqs_n` with an array of high impedance values as a placeholder, with its size being defined dynamically by the `DQS_BITS` parameter."
