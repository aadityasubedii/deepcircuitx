    "block_comment": "This Verilog block updates the status of valid bits on the positive clock edge. When the state machine is in an idle state (c_state == CS_IDLE), it updates the 'valid_bits_r' memory with the most significant bits of 'tag_rdata_way' for ways 2, 1, and 0. The block uses logical concatenation to group these bits and push them into the 'valid_bits_r' memory."
