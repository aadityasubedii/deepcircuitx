    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating register files and address registers at the positive edge of the clock cycle, provided there is no fetch stall involved. It uses a conditional assignment to update three separate register arrays (reg_ram_n, reg_ram_m, reg_ram_ds) and the r15 value with the provided input register (i_reg) or program counter (i_pc) depending on the write-enable signal (i_pc_wen). The registers rn_addr_reg, rm_addr_reg and rds_addr_reg are updated with rn_addr, rm_addr and rds_addr respectively . Furthermore, three boolean values (rn_15, rm_15, rds_15) are set to true if the corresponding selector signals (i_rn_sel, i_rm_sel, i_rds_sel) have the value of 4'hF."
