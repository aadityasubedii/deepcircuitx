Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for asserting a `wait_write_ack` signal. The signal `wait_write_ack` goes high when a write operation is initiated but not yet acknowledged. This is achieved through a combination of three conditions; `o_wb_stb` and `o_wb_we` signals are asserted indicating a valid write strobe, and `i_wb_ack` is not asserted meaning an acknowledgement for the write operation is yet to be received.
