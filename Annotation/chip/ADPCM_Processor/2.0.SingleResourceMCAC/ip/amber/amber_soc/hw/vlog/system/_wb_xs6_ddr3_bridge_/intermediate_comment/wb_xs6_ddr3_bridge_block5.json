    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for fetching data from a read buffer and forwarding it to a databus based on the specific address. The data is fetched at every positive edge of the clock cycle, under the condition that the read buffer is not empty and a read operation is active. The fetched data is segmented into four 32-bit sections - the selection of which is determined by the bits [3:2] of the read address. This decision is made by comparing these address bits to four possible values, with each corresponding to a respective segment of the data."
