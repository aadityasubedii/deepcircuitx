Comment: 
This block primarily handles data generation based on an input address and data mode. When a command start condition and the FIFO readiness signal or the command start condition alone are met, a 'w1data' variable is assigned data generated by the 'Data_Gen' or 'Data_GenW0' function based on the selected address (addr_i[8:5]) and data mode (data_mode_i). The data mode is checked against a value (4'b0101) to decide between the two functions. This block also has a separate handling for when a memory burst length equals 8, in which case 4 segments of 'w1data' are shifted and take in new data, effectively implementing a form of shift register with data augmentation on the least significant bits.
