    "block_comment": "This block of code carries out a function check when the ninth bit of the 'dqs_in' input signal undergoes a negative edge transition. The implementation method is an 'always' block in Verilog, which is triggered at all negative edges of the ninth bit of 'dqs_in'. Upon this trigger, the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' is invoked with the constant argument '8'.\n"
