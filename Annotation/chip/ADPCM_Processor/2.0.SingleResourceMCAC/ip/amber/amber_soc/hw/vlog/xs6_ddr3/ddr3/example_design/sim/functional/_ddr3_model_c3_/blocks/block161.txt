Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code executes a timing check on a command address. It specifically monitors changes to the fourth bit of the input address known as 'addr_in[3]'. Once a change in this bit is detected, it executes a procedure 'cmd_addr_timing_check()' with 10 as parameter. This procedure is likely to implement necessary measures for ensuring that the command address adheres to prescribed timing constraints, though the actual proceedings depend on its code which hasn't been provided here.
