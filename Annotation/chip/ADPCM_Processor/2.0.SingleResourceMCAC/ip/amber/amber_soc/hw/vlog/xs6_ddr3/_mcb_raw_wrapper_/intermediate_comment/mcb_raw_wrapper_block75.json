    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to catch an error condition where an invalid command is issued to a write-only port (port 2). The error condition occurs when the port configuration indicates a 'W32' write action, the command enable flag 'p2_cmd_en' is set to 1, and certain given conditions for 'p2_cmd_instr' bits are met. When this error condition is met, a warning message \"ERROR - Invalid Command for write only port 2\" is printed on the console and the code execution is stopped."
