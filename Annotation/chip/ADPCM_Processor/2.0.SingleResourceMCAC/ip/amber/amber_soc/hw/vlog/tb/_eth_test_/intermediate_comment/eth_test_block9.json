    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the boolean signal `init` to be true when the state of the system, denoted by `state_r`, is `PREB`. The \"assign\" keyword in Verilog is used to set up combinational logic assignments, creating a continuous assignment statement. This means whenever there is a change in value of `state_r`, the value of `init` is immediately updated. If `state_r` equals to `PREB`, `init` will be high (1), otherwise it will be low (0). This is a way of indicating system states in Verilog RTL code."
