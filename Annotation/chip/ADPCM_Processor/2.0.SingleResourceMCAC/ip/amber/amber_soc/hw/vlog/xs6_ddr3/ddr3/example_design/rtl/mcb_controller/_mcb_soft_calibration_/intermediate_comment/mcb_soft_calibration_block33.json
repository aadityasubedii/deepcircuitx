    "block_comment": "[Function of the block] This block of Verilog RTL code is a state machine which appears to be managing the state transitions related to MCB (Memory Controller Block). In particular it is involved in the transition of states concerning the termination write state of a clock pin typically found in DDR memory protocols.\n\n[Implementation details of the block] The transition between states is dependent on the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal. If this signal is not asserted (i.e., its value is 0), the state machine stays in its current state, which is UDQS_CLK_P_TERM_WAIT. If the signal is asserted (i.e., its value is 1), the state machine moves to the next state, UDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM."
