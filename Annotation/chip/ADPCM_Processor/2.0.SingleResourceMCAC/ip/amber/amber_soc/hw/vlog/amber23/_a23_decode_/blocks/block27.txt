Comment: 
This block of code assigns different types of interrupts based on the value of 'next_interrupt'. It uses a conditional (ternary) operator to check the value of 'next_interrupt' and based on that, assigns the corresponding interrupt_mode. For example, if 'next_interrupt' is 2, the interrupt_mode is set to FIRQ; if 'next_interrupt' is 3, the interrupt_mode is set to IRQ. For values 4, 5, 6, and 7 of 'next_interrupt', the interrupt mode is set to SVC. If 'next_interrupt' is 1, it also sets the interrupt mode to SVC and for any other case, it defaults to USR. This block of Verilog code effectively implements a priority encoder for different interrupt types in a system.
