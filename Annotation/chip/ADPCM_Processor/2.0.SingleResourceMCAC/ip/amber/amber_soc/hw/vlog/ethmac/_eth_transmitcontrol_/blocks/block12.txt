This block of code handles the state of the `BlockTxDone` signal in a transmitter based on certain conditions. The `BlockTxDone` signal is reset (set to 0) on a positive edge of the `TxReset` or maintained '1' when the `TxCtrlStartFrm` is high. Otherwise, if the `TxStartFrmIn` is high, `BlockTxDone` is again reset. The changes to the `BlockTxDone` signal are synchronous to the `MTxClk` system clock, ensuring operations are coordinated with the global system timing. The time delays defined by `#Tp` ensure the operations perform correctly within the system's timing constraints.
