Comment: 
This line of code is responsible for controlling the output of ByteCntOut based on the state of the DlyCrcEn signal. Depending on the condition specified by the ternary operator, ByteCntOut is assigned with either ByteCntDelayed or ByteCnt value. Specifically, when the DlyCrcEn signal is true, ByteCntDelayed value is assigned to ByteCntOut. If it is false, then ByteCnt value is used instead. This provides flexibility to switch between two modes of operation, depending on the state of DlyCrcEn signal.
