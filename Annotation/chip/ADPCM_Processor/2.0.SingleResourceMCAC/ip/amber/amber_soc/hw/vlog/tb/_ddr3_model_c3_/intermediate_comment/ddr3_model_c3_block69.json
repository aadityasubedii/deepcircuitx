    "block_comment": "The block of code inspects the 62nd bit of the 'dq_in' signal array to evaluate its current state. This is done by running the 'dq_timing_check' function anytime there's any change in the 62nd bit value (dq_in[61]). The function 'dq_timing_check(61)' confirms whether the 62nd bit follows the expected timing constraints in the system, ensuring the correct course of operation."
