This block of code implements a condition checking functionality for a FIFO buffer memory. At every positive going edge of the `wr_clk`, it checks and updates the `almost_full` signal. The `almost_full` signal is reset to '0' when `rst` signal is received. When either the `buf_avail` size reaches two less than the FIFO_DEPTH or reaches three less than the FIFO_DEPTH and simultaneously a write enable (`wr_en`) condition occurs, it sets signal `almost_full` as '1'. In all other conditions, `almost_full` remains '0'. This block serves as a mechanism to prevent FIFO overflow.
