    "block_comment": "This module is a flip-flop circuit that drives the 'mode_load_pulse' output signal. The logic level of the 'mode_load_pulse' signal changes in response to the rising edge of the 'clk_i' input clock signal. When the clock signal transitions from low to high, the output \u2018mode_load_pulse\u2019 gets updated after time delay 'TCQ'. The new output value is determined by the logical AND of 'mode_load_d1' and the logical NOT of 'mode_load_d2'."
