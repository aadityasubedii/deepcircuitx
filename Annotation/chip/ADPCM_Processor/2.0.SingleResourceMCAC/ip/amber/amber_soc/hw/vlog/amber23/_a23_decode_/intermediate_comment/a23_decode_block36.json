    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the next immediate shift amount and detects if the next immediate shift amount is zero. It assigns the value of `shift_imm` to `imm_shift_amount_nxt`, essentially setting the next immediate shift amount. It then checks if this next shift amount and `barrel_shift_amount_sel_nxt` equals a specific bitwise amount, and if so, assigns a boolean TRUE to `shift_imm_zero_nxt`, which signifies that the imminent shift amount is zero. The code effectively allows control over shift operations according to selected conditions."
