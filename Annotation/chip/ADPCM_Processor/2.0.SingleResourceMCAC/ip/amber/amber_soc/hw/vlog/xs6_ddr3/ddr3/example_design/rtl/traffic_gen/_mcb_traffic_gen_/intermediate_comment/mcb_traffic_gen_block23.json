    "block_comment": "This code block manages write data counts in a memory control block. It is clock-triggered, resetting the write data counts whenever the 'dcount_rst' signal is high. If the 'dcount_rst' signal is not high but 'mcb_wr_en' is, then the write data counts are incremented by the value of 'DWIDTH/8'. Here, '#TCQ' is used for synthesizable delay."
