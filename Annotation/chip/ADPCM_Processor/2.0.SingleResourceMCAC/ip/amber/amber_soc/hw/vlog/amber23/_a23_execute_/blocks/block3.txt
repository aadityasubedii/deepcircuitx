This block defines the instantiation of the `a23_register_bank` module. This module manages the registers in the A23 processor model. It receives various control signals from other parts of the processor including the clock signal, fetch stall information, multiplexer select signals, write enable control for the PC and general registers, new PC values, register write values and information about the current processor state including mode and status flags. The module also receives whether the current instruction is not issuing user-mode-enabled FIQ, which user mode registers should load, and status bits for the Register Data Stack during execution. The outputs of the module are the manipulated register values rm, rs, rd, rn, and pc.
