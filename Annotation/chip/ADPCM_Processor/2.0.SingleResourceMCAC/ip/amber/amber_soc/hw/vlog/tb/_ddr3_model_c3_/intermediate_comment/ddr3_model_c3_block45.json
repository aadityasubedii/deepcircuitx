    "block_comment": "This block of code invokes the function `dqs_pos_timing_check` when a falling edge (negative edge) of the signal `dqs_in` at index 20 is detected. In Verilog, the `always @` statement is used to create procedural blocks which are sensitive to the changes of specified signals. Here, `negedge dqs_in[20]` signifies that the block is sensitive to the negative edge of the signal `dqs_in[20]`, i.e., a transition from 1 to 0. When such a transition occurs, the function `dqs_pos_timing_check(20)` is called. This function presumably checks the positive timing conditions for the signal `dqs_in[20]`."
