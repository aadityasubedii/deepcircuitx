    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for data generation based on the input address and data mode. It handles the data generation for write commands, where the selected data is determined by the bits 3 to 7 of the address input. The generated data is either the output of the Data_Gen function or the Data_GenW0 function depending on the value of data_mode_i. In the default case, when the address doesn't match any of the predefined cases, zeros are assigned to w1data. The action is clocked, meaning it executes on the positive edge of the clk_i signal, and only if 'fifo_rdy_i' is high or a command 'cmd_startC' is initiated."
