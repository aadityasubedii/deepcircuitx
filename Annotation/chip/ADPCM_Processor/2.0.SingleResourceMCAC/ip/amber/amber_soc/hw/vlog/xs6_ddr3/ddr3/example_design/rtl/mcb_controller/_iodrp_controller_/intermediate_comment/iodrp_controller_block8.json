    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a shift register with reset and load functions. When synchronized reset (`sync_rst`) is on, the code reinitializes the shift register `shift_through_reg` at the positive edge of DRP_CLK to zero. If the reset is off, the operation depends on the `load_shift_n` flag. If `load_shift_n` is set to true, the data output multiplexer value `data_out_mux` is loaded into the register. Otherwise, the register undergoes a left shift operation where its content gets shifted to the left by one position, and the least significant bit position is filled with the value of `DRP_SDO`. The most significant bit is dropped during the shifting operation."
