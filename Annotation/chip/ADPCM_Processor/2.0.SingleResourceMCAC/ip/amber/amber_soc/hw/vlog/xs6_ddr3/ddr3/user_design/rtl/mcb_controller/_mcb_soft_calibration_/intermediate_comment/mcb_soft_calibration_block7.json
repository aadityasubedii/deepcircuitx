    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages a timer and a flag for defining a \"warm enough\" status under different conditions. The process runs every time a positive edge of UI_CLK occurs. The WaitTimer and WarmEnough signals are reset on a system reset (RST). If a self-refresh request has been rescinded in the current cycle, the WaitTimer is reset and the system is deemed not 'WarmEnough'. If the WaitTimer reaches a value of 'h4, signals stay unchanged and the system is considered 'WarmEnough'. If a wait count is enabled, the timer increments, otherwise it remains the same."
