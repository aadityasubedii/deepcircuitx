    "block_comment": "This block of code dynamically sets the value of `INC_COUNTS` based on the number of Data Quotient (DQ) pins (indicated by `NUM_DQ_PINS`). On every positive edge of `clk_i`, the block checks the range of `NUM_DQ_PINS` and correspondingly assigns a scaled increment count using delay `#TCQ` and memory burst interval `MEM_BURST_INT`. For different ranges of `NUM_DQ_PINS`, the increment scale varies, from 64 for 128-144 pins to 4 for 8 pins, dividing `MEM_BURST_INT` by 4 in each case."
