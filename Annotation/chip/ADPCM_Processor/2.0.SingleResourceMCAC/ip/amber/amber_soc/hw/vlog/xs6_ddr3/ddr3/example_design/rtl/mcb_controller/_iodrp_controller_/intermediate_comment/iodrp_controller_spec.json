    "spec": "Module name: iodrp_controller.\n\nModule specification: The iodrp_controller is a versatile module specifically crafted to manage an IO Distributed RAM-Programmable (IO DRP). Its operation pivots around a robust Finite State Machine (FSM), transitioning between functional states and effectively controlling memory operations. Key functionality includes the handling of memory cell states based on received commands and data exchanges among different phases. \n\nThe module takes in eight inputs, namely: memcell_address, write_data, rd_not_write, cmd_valid, use_broadcast, sync_rst, DRP_CLK, and DRP_SDO. 'memcell_address' and 'write_data' ports receive the address and the data for the memory cell, while the 'rd_not_write', 'cmd_valid' and 'use_broadcast' are control ports indicating read/write operation, command validity and data broadcast requirement respectively. The 'sync_rst' is a synchronous reset command, while 'DRP_CLK' is the clock input for the DRP controller and 'DRP_SDO' gets output data from the memory cell.\n\nSix outputs are generated namely: read_data, rdy_busy_n, DRP_CS, DRP_SDI, DRP_ADD, and DRP_BKST. 'read_data' outputs the data read from memory cell; 'rdy_busy_n' is the Ready/Busy indication signal; 'DRP_CS' is the Chip Select Signal, while 'DRP_SDI' takes in bits for the memory cell. 'DRP_ADD' and 'DRP_BKST' are flags indicating address phase and broadcast usage.\n\nInternally, the module features signals like memcell_addr_reg, data_reg, shift_through_reg, load_shift_n, addr_data_sel_n, bit_cnt, rd_not_write_reg, AddressPhase, state, nextstate, data_out_mux, and state_ascii. These help cater to requirements like storing address and data, shifting operations, FSM facilitation, and debugging support.\n\nThe module's source code hosts several operational blocks including the declaration of variables, inputs, and outputs, defining internal signals, setting local parameters, initializing variables, assigning values to different internal registers based on the processed logic, and managing the state transition of the FSM. As a whole, these blocks function collaboratively, enabling the iodrp_controller to perform its operations efficiently.",

Its operation pivots around a robust Finite State Machine (FSM), transitioning between functional states and effectively controlling memory operations. Key functionality includes the handling of memory cell states based on received commands and data exchanges among different phases. \n\nThe module takes in eight inputs, namely: memcell_address, write_data, rd_not_write, cmd_valid, use_broadcast, sync_rst, DRP_CLK, and DRP_SDO. 'memcell_address' and 'write_data' ports receive the address and the data for the memory cell, while the 'rd_not_write', 'cmd_valid' and 'use_broadcast' are control ports indicating read/write operation, command validity and data broadcast requirement respectively. The 'sync_rst' is a synchronous reset command, while 'DRP_CLK' is the clock input for the DRP controller and 'DRP_SDO' gets output data from the memory cell.\n\nSix outputs are generated namely: read_data, rdy_busy_n, DRP_CS, DRP_SDI, DRP_ADD, and DRP_BKST. 'read_data' outputs the data read from memory cell; 'rdy_busy_n' is the Ready/Busy indication signal; 'DRP_CS' is the Chip Select Signal, while 'DRP_SDI' takes in bits for the memory cell. 'DRP_ADD' and 'DRP_BKST' are flags indicating address phase and broadcast usage.\n\nInternally, the module features signals like memcell_addr_reg, data_reg, shift_through_reg, load_shift_n, addr_data_sel_n, bit_cnt, rd_not_write_reg, AddressPhase, state, nextstate, data_out_mux, and state_ascii. These help cater to requirements like storing address and data, shifting operations, FSM facilitation, and debugging support.\n\nThe module's source code hosts several operational blocks including the declaration of variables, inputs, and outputs, defining internal signals, setting local parameters, initializing variables, assigning values to different internal registers based on the processed logic, and managing the state transition of the FSM. As a whole, these blocks function collaboratively, enabling the iodrp_controller to perform its operations efficiently."
