    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code initiates a timing check for the 34th bit in the input data queue (dq_in). The function `dq_timing_check(33)` is called whenever there is a change in the value of the 34th bit in `dq_in`. This happens through the use of the 'always @' control structure, thus maintaining a constant monitor over this specific bit."
