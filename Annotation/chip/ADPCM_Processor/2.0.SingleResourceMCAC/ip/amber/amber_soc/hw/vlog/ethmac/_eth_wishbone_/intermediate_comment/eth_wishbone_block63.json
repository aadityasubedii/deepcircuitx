    "block_comment": "This block is a digital logic circuit that is designed to control the read operation of a Buffer Descriptor (BD) in a receive (Rx) path. It operates on the positive edge of either a write-behind (WB) clock pulse or a system reset condition. In implementation, if a system reset or a BD ready signal is detected, the read operation is suspended; otherwise, when a StartRxBDRead signal is generated and RxReady is not set (indicative of the Rx path being clear), the read operation is initiated."
