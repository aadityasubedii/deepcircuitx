    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code serves as a clocked sequential logic block for controlling whether a command is being processed. Upon a positive edge of the input clock signal (`clk_i`), it performs several checks on the reset input (`rst_i[8]`) and the command transfer signal (`xfer_cmd`). If the reset signal at the 8th index is high, it disables the command processing (by setting `cmd_en_r1` to 0). Alternatively, if a transfer command signal is detected, it enables the command processing (by setting `cmd_en_r1` to 1). If the memory controller command buffer (`mcb_cmd_full`) isn't full, it disables command processing to ensure no new commands are executed if the buffer isn't full. The updates to the `cmd_en_r1` signal are delayed by the constant `TCQ` to synchronize operations."
