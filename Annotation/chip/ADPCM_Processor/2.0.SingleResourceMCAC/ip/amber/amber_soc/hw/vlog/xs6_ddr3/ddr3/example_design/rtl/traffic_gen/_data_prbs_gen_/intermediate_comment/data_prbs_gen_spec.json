    "spec": "Module name: data_prbs_gen. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe `data_prbs_gen` module is a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generator primarily used for the production of random sequences of bits in digital communications. The generator's operation is conditioned by several clock signals and parameters. \n\nThe module contains several input ports such as `clk_i` (input clock signal), `clk_en` (clock enable signal), `rst_i` (reset input signal), `prbs_fseed_i` (input variable seed), `prbs_seed_init` (seed initialization input), and `prbs_seed_i` (fixed seed input for the PRBS generator). The 'clk_i' and 'clk_en' are mainly responsible for the synchronization of the module, while 'rst_i' is used to reset the operation of the module. 'prbs_fseed_i' and 'prbs_seed_i' are the seeds used in the module for random bit sequence generation, and 'prbs_seed_init' signifies when to initialize a seed in the module.\n\nThe output port for this module is `prbs_o`, which produces the output of the pseudo-random binary sequence.\n\nInternally, the module uses the `prbs` and `lfsr_q` registers. The `prbs` register is used to store the output of the PRBS generator before it is assigned to the `prbs_o` output port, while `lfsr_q` is a LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) used to generate the pseudo-random binary sequences in the PRBS generator. \n\nThe module operates in two main parts. The first part concerns the initialization and sequencing of the LFSR. The module takes an initial seed (`prbs_seed_i` or `prbs_fseed_i`). Based on the conditions fulfilled (reset or clock enable), the LFSR gets re-initialized or updated with a new pseudo-random sequence. The second part involves outputting the pseudo-random bit sequence. The current state or value of the LFSR is assigned to `prbs` which in turn is assigned to `prbs_o`, the ultimate output of the module.\n\nThis module offers complexity with its numerous clock signals and parameters, while also providing versatile functionality with its pseudo-random binary sequence generation capability. In all, it's a comprehensive RTL module designed to serve the purpose of generating pseudo-random sequences of bits for digital communications.",

In digital communications, such generators are typically used to produce random sequences of bits for data transmission. The module's operation is conditioned and controlled by a number of clock signals and parameters. An initial seed is provided, and the generator produces an output sequence `prbs_o`, based on the linear feedback shift register (LFSR) setup as per the code. Initialization of LFSR is done either with a given fixed seed `prbs_seed_i` or a dynamic seed input `prbs_fseed_i` if `prbs_seed_init` is set. After initialization, the LFSR gets clocked based on the signal `clk_en` and provides a pseudo-random binary output on `prbs_o`. The module also seems to have the ability to perform an EYE_TEST based on the parameter setting."
