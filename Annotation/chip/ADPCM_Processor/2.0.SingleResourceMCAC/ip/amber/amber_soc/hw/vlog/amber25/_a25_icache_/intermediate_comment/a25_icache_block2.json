    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the error management for unsupported 'ways' values in a cache system. If the input 'WAYS' is not equal to 2, 3, 4, or 8, it produces an error message indicating the unsupported number of ways. It also provides a suggestion to set a defined value to the variable A25_ICACHE_WAYS, specified in the file a25_config_defines.v, to rectify the issue."
