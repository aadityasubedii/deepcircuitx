Comment: 
This block primarily manages the DribbleNibble signal in relation to a variety of conditions. Predicated on either the rising edge of the MRxClk signal or a positive-edge Reset signal, the DribbleNibble is set to 0 whenever the Reset signal is high or when the RxStateSFD is high. On the other hand, if MRxDV is low and the second bit of RxStateData is high, the DribbleNibble is activated, i.e., set to 1.
