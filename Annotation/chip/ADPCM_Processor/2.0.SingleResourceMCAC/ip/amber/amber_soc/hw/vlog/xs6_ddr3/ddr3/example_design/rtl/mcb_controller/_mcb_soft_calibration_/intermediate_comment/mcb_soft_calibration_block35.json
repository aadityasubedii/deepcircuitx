    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a state machine transition in a memory controller design. Depending on the deassertion of the `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` signal, the state machine would transition to the `LDQS_PIN_N_TERM_WAIT` state. However, if the `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` signal is asserted, it progresses to the `UDQS_CLK_WRITE_P_TERM` state. In summary, this block controls state transitions based on the status of the memory controller readiness signal."
