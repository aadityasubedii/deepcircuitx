Module-level comment: The 'afifo' module implements an asynchronous FIFO buffer handling data flow at different read/write rates. Inputs are managed under write clock (wr_clk), while outputs follow the read clock (rd_clk). FIFO buffer uses a memory array (mem) with read/write pointers. Synchronization is achieved using separate blocks which handle data writing, reading, and address generation. Status signals indicate if the FIFO is full, almost full or empty. Data width, FIFO depth and clock delay are customizable.
