This block of code is responsible for writing N-Termination settings to a memory cell address during the WRITE mode of the Universal Double Data Rate (DDR) Quality Service Clock (UDQS_CLK). Through addressing the IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR to NTerm, it sets its WRITE mode and the WRITE_DATA to {1'b0, N_Term_s}. The memory control block (MCB) UI Address is set to IOI_UDQS_CLK and the MCB_CMD_VALID is asserted high. If MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is high, the STATE stays in the current state, else it transitions to UDQS_CLK_N_TERM_WAIT showing that it is awaiting N-Termination.
