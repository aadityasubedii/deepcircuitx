    "block_comment": "This block of code forms a simple one-directional pipe router structure using a \"for\" loop in Verilog. It connects the output of one network generator block (netgen) to the input of the preceding one, creating a path where the data flows through multiple blocks in a chain. The loop iterates from index 1 to index 5, hence interconnecting 5 blocks in the aforementioned manner."
