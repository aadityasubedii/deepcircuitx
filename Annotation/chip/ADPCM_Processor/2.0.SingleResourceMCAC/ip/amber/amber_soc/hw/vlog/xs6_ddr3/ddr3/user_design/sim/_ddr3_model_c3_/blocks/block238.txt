This code block is performing a delay simulation in a bus system using the Verilog hardware description language. By using the 'always' keyword, this block creates a process where any changes in the 'addr' signal will trigger the block. Subsequently, the delay specified by the #BUS_DELAY parameter is inserted before the 'addr' signal is assigned to 'addr_in'. This demonstrates a typical use case of non-blocking statements in Verilog, providing a more accurate simulation of real hardware, specifically the delay of signals in a bus system.
