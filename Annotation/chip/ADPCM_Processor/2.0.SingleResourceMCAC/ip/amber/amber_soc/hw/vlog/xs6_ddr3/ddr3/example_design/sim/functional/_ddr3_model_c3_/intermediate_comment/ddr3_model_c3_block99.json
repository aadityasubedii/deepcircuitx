    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is managing a timing check for a specific bit of a 32-bit digital signal, specifically, it checks the 32nd bit. Implemented as an 'always' block, it is designed to constantly monitor the state of the 32nd bit of the 'dq_in' signal. Every time the 32nd bit of 'dq_in' changes, it triggers the 'dq_timing_check' function with an argument of '31', corresponding to the index of the checked bit in zero-indexed array."
