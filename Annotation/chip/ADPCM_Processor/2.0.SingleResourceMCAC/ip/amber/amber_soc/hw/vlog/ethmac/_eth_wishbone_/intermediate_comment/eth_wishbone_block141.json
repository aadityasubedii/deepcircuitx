    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the control signal, BlockingTxStatusWrite, for writing to a transmission status register. Upon receiving a positive edge on WB_CLK_I or Reset, the code checks a series of conditions to update BlockingTxStatusWrite. Initially, it sets BlockingTxStatusWrite to '0' if a reset condition is detected. In the absence of the reset, the code evaluates whether a transmission is not complete and not aborted, in which case BlockingTxStatusWrite is again set to '0'. If neither of these conditions is met and if a write to the transmission status is requested (TxStatusWrite='1'), BlockingTxStatusWrite is set to '1'."
