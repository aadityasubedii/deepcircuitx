This block of code initiates a conditional generate construct, setting up synchronous write operations based on the 'SYNC' parameter. When 'SYNC' is set to 1, an always block, labelled 'WRSYNC', is instantiated that is sensitive to changes in the 'wr_ptr' signal. The specifics of the always block would be dependent on codes within the block which are not provided, but most likely includes write operations synchronized to a clock signal, synchronized by write pointer updates.
