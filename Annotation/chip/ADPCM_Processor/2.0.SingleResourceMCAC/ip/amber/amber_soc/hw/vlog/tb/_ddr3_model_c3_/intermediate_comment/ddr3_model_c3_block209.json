    "block_comment": "The block serves as a DQS (data strobe) receiver that handles even DQS signals. It employs a register bit_mask, whose value is calculated based on the number of DQ lines per DQS ((`DQ_PER_DQS{1'b1}}) and translated based on the input i. Based on the DQS condition, the task modifies the dm_in_pos[i] and dq_in_pos values. If tdqs_en is high, the task suppresses the dm_in_pos[i] to 0. If not, it assigns dm_in[i] to dm_in_pos[i]. For dq_in_pos, it uses bitwise operations with the dq_in and bit_mask, ensuring only specific bits, determined by bit_mask, are altered."
