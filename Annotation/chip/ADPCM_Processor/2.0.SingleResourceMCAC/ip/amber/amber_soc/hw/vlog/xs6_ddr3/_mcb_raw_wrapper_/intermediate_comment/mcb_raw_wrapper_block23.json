    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is utilized to generate an IOI (Input Output Interface) reset control for DDR3 memory type. Essentially, the primary function of this block is to define an OSERDES2 (Output Serializer/Deserializer) instance which is used in high-speed data transmission applications. It's configured with constants for clocking, output mode, data rate, etc., and instantiated as \"ioi_rst_0\". The IOI reset and control signal logic is connected to various top-level and internal control signals. Importantly, it ensures that the DDR3 memory-based devices reset and start up reliably by generating the appropriate control signals."
