    "block_comment": "This block is used to generate a named block `RDSYNC` conditionally only if the parameter `SYNC` is equal to 1. Leveraging Verilog's `generate` and conditional `if` constructs, the block dynamically creates the `RDSYNC` block during elaboration based on compile-time or module instantiation parameters. This provides flexibility for including/excluding hardware during implementation."
