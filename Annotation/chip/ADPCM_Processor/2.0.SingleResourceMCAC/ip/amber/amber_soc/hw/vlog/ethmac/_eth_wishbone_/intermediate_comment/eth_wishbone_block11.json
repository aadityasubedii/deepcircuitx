    "block_comment": "To provide a suitable format and data necessary for training a language model for code comment generation tasks focused specifically on Verilog RTL codes, first, we have to preprocess the raw data. An integral step in doing this is segmenting the entire Verilog RTL code into several blocks. Unfortunately, you've only provided a small part of the code (\"if(Reset)\") which is insufficient for creating a comprehensive summary. Nevertheless, here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify Blocks of Code:** Navigate through the entire code to find meaningful blocks of code. A block usually starts from a conditional (if, while, for, etc.) statement or function/method definition and ends where the code block's scope ends. \n   \n2. **Code and Comment Extraction:** For each block, extract the actual Verilog RTL code, and if the block has comments, they'll serve as the preferred ground truth. For this input-output pair, the code serves as the input, and the comments act as the output.\n\n3. **Additional Comment Generation:** If a block of code doesn't have comments, manually generate human-readable, language-agnostic comments comprehensively describing what the block does, and how it achieves its purpose.\n\n4. **Formatting:** Finally, format the extracted code and comments in a way the programming-language model can understand. It's preferred to use formats like JSON, CSV, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, your snippet \"if (Reset)\" isn't enough to generate meaningful data pair for the language model. Please provide a larger codebase for accurate and detailed generations."
