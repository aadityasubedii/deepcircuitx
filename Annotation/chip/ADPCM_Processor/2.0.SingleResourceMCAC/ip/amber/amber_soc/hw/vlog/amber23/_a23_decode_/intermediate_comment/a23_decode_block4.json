    "block_comment": "The block of code declares two wire data types, 'xCONTROL_STATE' and 'xMODE'. Both wires are defined as vector arrays with a range of (15*8)-1:0, that equates to 119:0. This suggests that Tthese wires can handle 120 bits of data. In Verilog hardware description language, a 'wire' data type is typically used for connecting different modules. They could be essentially a part of the state machine control logic or for mode setting for different operational scenarios of the design. The actual roles of these wires would be clarified by their usage in other parts of the code.\n"
