This block initializes the system state and sets up a few error checks on startup. First, it checks if the preset maximum bottom level (BL_MAX) is less than 2, displaying an error if true. Also, it verifies whether 2 to the power of BO_BITS is greater than BL_MAX, again displaying an error if so. Then, it sets the time format and initializes the seed for the pseudo-random generator with the defined constant (RANDOM_SEED). Finally, it resets the clock counter (ck_cntr) to zero to start the simulation.
