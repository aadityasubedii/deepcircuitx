This block of Verilog code represents a write operation of a synchronous FIFO memory. At each positive edge of the write clock (`wr_clk`), the block listens for a write enable (`wr_en`) signal that isn't full (`!full`). If these conditions are met, data (`wr_data`) is written into the memory array at the write address (`wr_addr`) with a specified clock quality time (`#TCQ`). This ensures that data only gets written to the memory when enabled, not full, and at the applicable addressing scheme.
