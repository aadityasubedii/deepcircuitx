    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a serializer module (OSERDES2) named `ioi_ldm_0`, designed for data serialization and signal manipulation. The defined parameters include the operating mode, data rates, and bypass settings, along with a data width of two. Connections are established to numerous IO signals, clock signals, and reset controls as per the defined parameters. The serializer outputs are connected to `ldm_oq` and `ldm_t`, while inputs such as `dqplm` and `dqnlm` are feeding data to the serializer. The module incorporates several 1-bit constants to particular ports for specific operational activities. Notably, the module utilizes a 90-degree phase shift IO clock (`ioclk90`) and an internal system reset signal (`int_sys_rst`)."
