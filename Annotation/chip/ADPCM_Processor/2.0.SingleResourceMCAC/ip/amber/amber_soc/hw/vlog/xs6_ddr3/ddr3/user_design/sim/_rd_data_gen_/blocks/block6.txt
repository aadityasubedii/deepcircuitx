The function of this block is to equalize the output 'cmd_rdy_o' with the local variable 'cmd_rdy'. It is implemented using the continuous assignment statement 'assign', which assigns the value of the right-hand expression ('cmd_rdy') to the left-hand net ('cmd_rdy_o') and keeps them always equal. This statement is concurrent, which means it is always ready to execute immediately when the right-hand expression changes.
