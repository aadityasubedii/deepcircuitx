Comment: 
This block of code invokes the `dq_timing_check` function every time the 58th bit (index 57) of the `dq_in` signal changes. In Verilog, the 'always' block is used for procedural assignments and gets triggered whenever there's a change in the specified event control; in this case, the change on bit 57 of `dq_in` signal. The function `dq_timing_check(57)` is likely checking the timing properties of the dq_in signal at that specific bit position.
