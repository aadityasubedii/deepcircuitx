    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog RTL code is designed to check for invalid commands specifically for Port 4 when it is in the read-only mode. This is achieved by assessing the conditions within the IF statement which checks if Port 4 is in read-only mode, whether a command enable signal is present (p4_cmd_en == 1), and if the command instruction signal, p4_cmd_instr, matches the pattern indicative of a write instruction (p4_cmd_instr[2] == 0 && p4_cmd_instr[0] == 0). In case of an invalid attempt to perform a write command on this read-only port, the system is programmed to display an error message and halt the execution immediately."
