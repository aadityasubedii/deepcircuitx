    "block_comment": "This block of code writes and synchronizes the status of a blocking transmission in Verilog code. If a reset signal is detected on the positive edge, the status of the BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync2 is set to zero, indicating that the transmission has been reset. If no reset signal is given, the block preserves the current status of BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync1 and assigns to BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync2, essentially serving as a synchronization tool between these two status signals."
