    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for resetting and managing the status of the read MCB FIFO buffer. Whenever a rising edge of the clock is detected or if the reset signal is high, the block will set the `mcb_rd_empty_r` signal high which signifies the MCB read FIFO buffer is empty. However, if the buffer's count decreases to 1 or less, the signal `mcb_rd_empty_r` will also be set high, representing the buffer is nearly empty. Otherwise, when more than 1 item is in the buffer, the `mcb_rd_empty_r` signal is set to low, indicating the presence of data in the buffer."
