This block of code establishes a flip-flop with asynchronous reset and output control logic for the RXC interrupt function. The flip-flop is active at every positive edge of the clock or when the "Reset" signal goes high, where "irq_rxc" is reset to 0 immediately. When the "SetRxCIrq" signal goes high during the clock's positive edge, after a propagation delay denoted by Tp, "irq_rxc" is set to 1. If none of the above conditions are true but the least significant bit of "INT_SOURCE_Wr" and the 7th bit of "DataIn" are high, "irq_rxc" resets to 0 after propagation delay Tp.
