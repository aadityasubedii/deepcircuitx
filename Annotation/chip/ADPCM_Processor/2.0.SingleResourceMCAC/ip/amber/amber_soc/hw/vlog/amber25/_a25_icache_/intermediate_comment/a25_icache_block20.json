    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for selecting the next way when three ways (WAYS == 3) are provided (pick_way_3ways). This selection is based on the currently valid bits (valid_bits_r), and random selection value (random_num) using the function 'pick_way'. The function 'pick_way' is likely to implement a defined algorithm to choose the way based on the mentioned inputs. This block is contained within an 'else if' condition indicating it comes after previous conditional checks and before other potential conditions."
