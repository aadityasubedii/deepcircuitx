    "block_comment": "This block of code determines if there's a cache hit in a specific way of a cache system. It does this by checking three conditions: If the most significant bit (MSB) of the tag read data, `tag_rdata_way[i][TAG_WIDTH-1]`, is set; if the lower part of the tag read data `tag_rdata_way[i][TAG_ADDR_WIDTH-1:0]` matches the higher part of the device memory address `i_address[31:TAG_ADDR32_LSB]`; and if the current cache state `c_state` is idle, denoted by `CS_IDLE`."
