    "block_comment": "This block decodes a 16-bit instruction into its corresponding micro-operation by assigning it a 4-bit mtrans_reg value. The implementation utilizes a combinational case block which checks each bit position of 'instruction[15:0]' to determine the first '1' set from the right-hand side. Based on the position, a corresponding mtrans_reg value is assigned. If no '1' bit is found in the instruction, it defaults to 4'hf. Thus, it's implementing a priority encoder for 16-bit instructions."
