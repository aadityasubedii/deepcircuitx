This block initializes an instance of the `eth_crc` module which functions as a transmitter CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) for Ethernet data transmission. The module works by taking a clock signal `MTxClk`, system `Reset`, data to be checked `Data_Crc`, enabling signal `Enable_Crc`, initialization signal `Initialize_Crc` as inputs, and outports the calculated CRC value `Crc` and a CRC error flag `CrcError`. This aids in ensuring data integrity during transmission by providing error-detection capability for the Ethernet frames.
