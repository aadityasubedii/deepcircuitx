Comment: 
The given Verilog RTL block is responsible for incrementing a bit counter on the positive edge of the DRP clock under specific conditions. The counter is increased by one when the state of the machine is either in the Address Phase or the Data Phase and there is no synchronous reset signal. If the conditions aren't met, the bit counter resets to an explicit 3 bit zero (`3'b000`).
