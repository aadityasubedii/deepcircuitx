Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code is responsible for copying the value of one signal into another. Specifically, it assigns the current state of the `mcb_cmd_full_i` signal to `cmd_full`. This typically indicates that `cmd_full` will be used elsewhere in the code to represent the state of the `mcb_cmd_full_i` signal.
