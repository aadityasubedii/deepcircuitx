    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is handling the assignment of certain master bus signals to slave bus signals. The signals o_s2_wb_adr, o_s2_wb_dat, and o_s2_wb_sel are assigned the values of master signals master_adr, master_wdat, and master_sel respectively. Control signals (o_s2_wb_we, o_s2_wb_cyc, and o_s2_wb_stb) for the bus are enabled only when the current active slave is '2', otherwise they are disabled. This assignment logic creates a critical pathway for data and control signal transmission between the master and a specific slave in a bus system."
