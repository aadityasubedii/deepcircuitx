    "spec": "Module name: eth_shiftreg. \n\nModule specification: The eth_shiftreg is a hardware module designed for Ethernet operations, specifically acting as a Shift Register. This module takes inputs such as Clk (the clock signal), Reset (resets the module's registers), MdcEn_n (controls the module's operation), Mdi (alters ShiftReg and Prsd values), Fiad and Rgad (address line inputs), CtrlData (control data), WriteOp (operation status), ByteSelect (selects which byte of data is processed), and LatchByte (controls whether to latch onto lower or upper byte). The module outputs include ShiftedBit, Prsd, and LinkFail. In terms of internal signals, ShiftReg is an 8-bit register holding shifted values during operation, Prsd is a 16-bit register holding processed data, and LinkFail is a single-bit signal indicating the status of the link. Module's operation depends largely on the input 'MdcEn_n'. If 'MdcEn_n' is asserted, the module performs a case operation based on 'ByteSelect'. In case 'MdcEn_n' is not asserted, new values for 'ShiftReg' and 'Prsd' are computed based on 'ShiftReg', 'Mdi', and 'LatchByte' signals. Also, if 'Reset' signal is high, the module resets 'ShiftReg', 'Prsd', and 'LinkFail' to their initial states. Lastly, the most significant bit of 'ShiftReg' is assigned to output 'ShiftedBit'. This module ensures proper Ethernet operation in the larger system.",

It has a main functionality based on the MdcEn_n signal which if asserted, the module implements a case function depending on the ByteSelect value (and operates based on WriteOp, Fiad, and Rgad). If not asserted, it constructs new values for ShiftReg and Prsd based on ShiftReg, Mdi, and LatchByte signals.
