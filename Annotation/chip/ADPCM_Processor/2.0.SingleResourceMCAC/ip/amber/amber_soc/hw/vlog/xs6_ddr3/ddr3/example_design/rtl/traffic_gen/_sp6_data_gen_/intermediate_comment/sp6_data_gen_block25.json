    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code determines the data source based on the input `data_mode_i`. The control variable `data_mode_i` is a 4-bit binary and based on its value, `data` will be set to `fixed_data_i`, `adata`, `hdata`, `ndata`, `w1data` or `prbs_data`. If `data_mode_i` doesn't match any of the specificed conditions, `data` is set to 0 by default."
