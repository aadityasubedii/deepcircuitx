    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for assignment of register values to their respective outputs. It accomplishes this through an 'assign' statement that directly links each register (r0 through r7) to its corresponding output (r0_out through r7_out) in the design. This allows for easy access and modification of the register values without affecting their original content within the system."
