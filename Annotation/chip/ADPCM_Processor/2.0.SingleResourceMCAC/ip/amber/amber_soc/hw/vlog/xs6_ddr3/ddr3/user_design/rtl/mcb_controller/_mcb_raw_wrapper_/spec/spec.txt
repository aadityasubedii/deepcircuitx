Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: The mcb_raw_wrapper module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) designed to interface with various types of DDR memory, including DDR, DDR2, DDR3, and MDDR. It handles the physical interface between the FPGA and the memory, implementing features such as data read/write, address management, and command issuing. The module supports multiple port configurations, different memory widths (4, 8, or 16 bits), and various memory-specific signals like CAS, RAS, and ODT. Input ports include clock signals (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), PLL signals (pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock), reset (sys_rst), and multiple ports (p0 to p5) for commands, read/write
