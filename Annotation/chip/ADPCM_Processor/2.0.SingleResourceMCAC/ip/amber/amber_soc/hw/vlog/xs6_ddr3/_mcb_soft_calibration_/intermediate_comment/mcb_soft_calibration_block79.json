    "block_comment": "This block manages the reset and calibration done signal in response to rising-edge clock inputs. On every positive edge of UI_CLK, the DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL signal is set based on a logical AND operation involving the result of an OR operation and the MCB_UODONECAL signal. The OR operation checks if DQS_DELAY_INITIAL is non-zero or if the STATE equals 'DONE'. This seems like part of a delay-line calibration routine in a memory controller or similar structure."
