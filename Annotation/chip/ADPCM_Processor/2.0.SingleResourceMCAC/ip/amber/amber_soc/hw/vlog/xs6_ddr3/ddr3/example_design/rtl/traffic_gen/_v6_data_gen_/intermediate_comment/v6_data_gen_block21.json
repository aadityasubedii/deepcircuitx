    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles data generation patterns for a system with 128 DQ pins. If the system has 128 DQ pins and the data pattern selected is either 'NEIGHBOR', 'WALKING1', 'WALKING0', or 'ALL', this block activates the corresponding mechanism (named as 'WALKING_ONE_128_PATTERN'), suggesting usage in data testing or validation."
