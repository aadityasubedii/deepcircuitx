This block of code calculates the amount of filled space in a buffer. It employs simple arithmetics by subtracting the value of the 'rd_ptr' (read pointer) from the 'wr_capture_ptr' (write capture pointer). The result of this subtraction operation is assigned to 'buf_filled', indicating the current filled space in the buffer.
