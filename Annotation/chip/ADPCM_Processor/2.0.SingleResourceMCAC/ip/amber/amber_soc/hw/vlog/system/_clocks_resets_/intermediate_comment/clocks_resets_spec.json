    "spec": "Module name: `clocks_resets`. \n\nModule specification: The `clocks_resets` module is specifically designed for the management of clocks and resets in an FPGA based system. The input ports of this module are the board reset (`i_brd_rst`), the board clock negative (`i_brd_clk_n`),  board clock positive (`i_brd_clk_p`), and DDR calibration done signal (`i_ddr_calib_done`). These inputs play crucial roles in managing the system's power initiation process and synchronizing the system's operation with the underlying hardware clock infrastructure. Conversely, the output ports are the system reset (`o_sys_rst`), system clock (`o_sys_clk`) and a specialized 200 MHz clock (`o_clk_200`). These outputs direct the system's operational pace synchronously with other peripheral hardwares. The module utilizes several internal signals like `calib_done_33mhz`, `rst0`, `pll_locked`, `clkfbout_clkfbin`, `rst0_sync_r`, `ddr_calib_done_sync_r`, `rst_tmp`, `pll_clk`, `brd_clk_ibufg`, that are indispensable for providing a synchronization mechanism, managing clock signals, handling the phase-locked loop state, and facilitating accurate signal propagation within the module. This module contains various sections that handle clock generation, signal synchronization, and system resets. The way these sections work depends on the type of FPGA in use (XILINX SPARTAN6 FPGA, XILINX VIRTEX6 FPGA, or other FPGAs). It uses a behavior model to generate system clock signals if a XILINX FPGA is not in use. With this detailed orchestration of various sections in response to the FPGA configuration in the `clocks_resets` module, the system is capable of operating in a synchronized and streamlined fashion ensuring precise clock management and reset operations.",

It has inputs for board reset (`i_brd_rst`), board clock negative (`i_brd_clk_n`), board clock positive (`i_brd_clk_p`), and DDR calibration done (`i_ddr_calib_done`). It generates output for system reset (`o_sys_rst`), system clock (`o_sys_clk`), and 200 MHz clock (`o_clk_200`). \nThe system reset is asserted when either reset signal `rst0` is high or `calib_done_33mhz` is low. \nThe clocks are generated based on various factors such as the PLL lock state and are adjusted based on specific FPGA devices like XILINX SPARTAN6 FPGA or XILINX VIRTEX6 FPGA. \nThe module uses a synchronization mechanism to handle input and system reset signals with the system clock.\nIn cases where a XILINX FPGA is not being used, it uses a behavioral model to generate system clock signals."

It is used reset the system at power-up or when needed.\n2. `i_brd_clk_n`: This is the board clock negative signal. It's part of a differential clock input, providing an inverted clock signal.\n3. `i_brd_clk_p`: This is the board clock positive signal. It's part of a differential clock input, providing a non-inverted clock signal.\n4. `i_ddr_calib_done`: This signal is triggered when DDR calibration is done.\n\nExplanation: Input ports are used to feed signals into the module. Here, we have reset and clock inputs, further we also have a signal to signify calibration completion.\n\nOutput Ports: \n1. `o_sys_rst`: This is the system reset output signal. The system reset is asserted when reset signal `rst0` is high or `calib_done_33mhz` is low.\n2. `o_sys_clk`: This is the system clock output signal. This signal is used to provide timing for sequential elements in other parts of the system.\n3. `o_clk_200`: This is the 200 MHz clock output. It is a clock signal that runs at 200 MHz and is used to clock high-speed digital logic circuits.\n\nExplanation: Output ports are used to send signal from the module to the surrounding logic or other modules.

            "content": "Module name: `clocks_resets`. \n\nModule specification: The `clocks_resets` module is specifically designed for the management of clocks and resets in an FPGA based system. The input ports of this module are the board reset (`i_brd_rst`), the board clock negative (`i_brd_clk_n`),  board clock positive (`i_brd_clk_p`), and DDR calibration done signal (`i_ddr_calib_done`). These inputs play crucial roles in managing the system's power initiation process and synchronizing the system's operation with the underlying hardware clock infrastructure. Conversely, the output ports are the system reset (`o_sys_rst`), system clock (`o_sys_clk`) and a specialized 200 MHz clock (`o_clk_200`). These outputs direct the system's operational pace synchronously with other peripheral hardwares. The module utilizes several internal signals like `calib_done_33mhz`, `rst0`, `pll_locked`, `clkfbout_clkfbin`, `rst0_sync_r`, `ddr_calib_done_sync_r`, `rst_tmp`, `pll_clk`, `brd_clk_ibufg`, that are indispensable for providing a synchronization mechanism, managing clock signals, handling the phase-locked loop state, and facilitating accurate signal propagation within the module. This module contains various sections that handle clock generation, signal synchronization, and system resets. The way these sections work depends on the type of FPGA in use (XILINX SPARTAN6 FPGA, XILINX VIRTEX6 FPGA, or other FPGAs). It uses a behavior model to generate system clock signals if a XILINX FPGA is not in use. With this detailed orchestration of various sections in response to the FPGA configuration in the `clocks_resets` module, the system is capable of operating in a synchronized and streamlined fashion ensuring precise clock management and reset operations."

                    "text": "Module name: `clocks_resets`. \n\nModule specification: The `clocks_resets` module is specifically designed for the management of clocks and resets in an FPGA based system. The input ports of this module are the board reset (`i_brd_rst`), the board clock negative (`i_brd_clk_n`),  board clock positive (`i_brd_clk_p`), and DDR calibration done signal (`i_ddr_calib_done`). These inputs play crucial roles in managing the system's power initiation process and synchronizing the system's operation with the underlying hardware clock infrastructure. Conversely, the output ports are the system reset (`o_sys_rst`), system clock (`o_sys_clk`) and a specialized 200 MHz clock (`o_clk_200`). These outputs direct the system's operational pace synchronously with other peripheral hardwares. The module utilizes several internal signals like `calib_done_33mhz`, `rst0`, `pll_locked`, `clkfbout_clkfbin`, `rst0_sync_r`, `ddr_calib_done_sync_r`, `rst_tmp`, `pll_clk`, `brd_clk_ibufg`, that are indispensable for providing a synchronization mechanism, managing clock signals, handling the phase-locked loop state, and facilitating accurate signal propagation within the module. This module contains various sections that handle clock generation, signal synchronization, and system resets. The way these sections work depends on the type of FPGA in use (XILINX SPARTAN6 FPGA, XILINX VIRTEX6 FPGA, or other FPGAs). It uses a behavior model to generate system clock signals if a XILINX FPGA is not in use. With this detailed orchestration of various sections in response to the FPGA configuration in the `clocks_resets` module, the system is capable of operating in a synchronized and streamlined fashion ensuring precise clock management and reset operations."
