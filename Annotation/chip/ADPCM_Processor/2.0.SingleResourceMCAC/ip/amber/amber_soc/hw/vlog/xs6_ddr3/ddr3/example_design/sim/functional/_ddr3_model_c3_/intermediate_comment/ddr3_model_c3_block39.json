    "block_comment": "The function of the block is to monitor the negative edge transition of a specific data strobe signal 'dqs_in[26]'. Whenever the negative edge of 'dqs_in[26]' occurs, it triggers a timing check function - 'dqs_pos_timing_check' with argument '26'. Therefore, the purpose of this block is to facilitate necessary checks during data transfer by keeping track of the DQS signal's negative edge."
