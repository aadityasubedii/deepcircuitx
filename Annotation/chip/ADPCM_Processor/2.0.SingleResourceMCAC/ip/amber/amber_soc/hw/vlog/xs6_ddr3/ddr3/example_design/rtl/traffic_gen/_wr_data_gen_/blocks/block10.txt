Comment: 
This block handles the command readiness state in a synchronous circuit. It uses clock triggering (on the rising edge) to control the state of `cmd_rdy`, which indicates whether or not a command is ready. When the circuit is reset (`rst_i[0]` is true) or a single-item burst mode is enabled (`bl_i` equals 1), `cmd_rdy` is set to 1, indicating the readiness for a new command. If else the user has specified a burst count of 2 and the FIFO storage is not full (`fifo_not_full`), `cmd_rdy` is also set to 1. For any other conditions, `cmd_rdy` is set to 0, indicating no command readiness. The state change is awaited for a delay of #TCQ.
