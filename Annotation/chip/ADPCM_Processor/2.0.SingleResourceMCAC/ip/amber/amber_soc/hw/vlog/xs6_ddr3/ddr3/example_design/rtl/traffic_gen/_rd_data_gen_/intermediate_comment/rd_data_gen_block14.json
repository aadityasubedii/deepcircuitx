    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the synchronization and delay of input signals in a sequential digital design. The block gets triggered on the rising edge of the input clock signal 'clk_i'. It then uses delays specified by the propagation delay 'TCQ' to generate synchronized versions of the input data_ready and command_valid signals. Specifically, it creates two delayed versions of the data_ready signal ('data_rdy_r1', 'data_rdy_r2') and one of the command_valid signal ('cmd_valid_r1'). By doing so, it takes care of the propagation delay ensuring correct functionality of the overall module."
