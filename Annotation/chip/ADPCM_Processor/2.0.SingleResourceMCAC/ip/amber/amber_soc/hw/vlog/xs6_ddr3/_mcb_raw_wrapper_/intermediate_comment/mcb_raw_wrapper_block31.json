    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the memory type setting for a memory module. If the type of memory defined is not DDR2, then the code assigns the 'cke_train' value to logic 0. This ensures the cke_train signal is deactivated when not utilizing DDR2 memory. All operations are executed in compile-time using generate-construct and it's contingent on a predetermined parameter C_MEM_TYPE."
