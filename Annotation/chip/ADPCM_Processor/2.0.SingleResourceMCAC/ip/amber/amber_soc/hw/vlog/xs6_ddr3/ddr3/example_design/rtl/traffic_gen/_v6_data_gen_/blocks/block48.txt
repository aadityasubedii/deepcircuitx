The block ensures data generation based on a specific pattern within predefined conditions. Upon each positive edge of clk_i, if fifo_rdy_i is high or cmd_startC is initiated, the function proceeds; else, data is rearranged. Within the initiated function, if sel_w1gen_logic is true, w1data is assigned a certain value which is determined by two factors: the 4 high bits of addr_i and the value of data_mode_i. Depending on these conditions, the values are derived from either Data_Gen or Data_GenW0 functions. If none of these conditions match, w1data is set to 0. Else if MEM_BURST_LEN equals 8, the bits within w1data are shifted and reassigned accordingly.
