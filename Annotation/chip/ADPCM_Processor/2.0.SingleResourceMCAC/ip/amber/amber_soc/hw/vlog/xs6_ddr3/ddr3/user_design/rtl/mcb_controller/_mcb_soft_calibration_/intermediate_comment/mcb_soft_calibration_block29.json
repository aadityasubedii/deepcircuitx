    "block_comment": "The function block called Mult_Divide performs both multiplication and division operation on 8-bit inputs. The block firstly multiplies an input value with a multiplier by performing iterative addition for \"Mult\" times, storing the result in a 16-bit register. Afterwards, this result is divided by the value of \"Div\". The final output is the lower 8 bits of the resultant division. All calculations are performed in an unsigned manner."
