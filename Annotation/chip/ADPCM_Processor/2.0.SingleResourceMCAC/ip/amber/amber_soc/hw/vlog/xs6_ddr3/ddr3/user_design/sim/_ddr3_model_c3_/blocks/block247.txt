Comment: 
This block of code defines a delay modeled by a Verilog non-blocking statement which is applied to a clock signal. The delay simulation is achieved by using a non-blocking assignment to a clock signal `ck`. The delay time of the clock signal `ck` is specified by the parameter `BUS_DELAY`, and the delayed clock signal is assigned to `ck_in`. The operation is triggered on every edge of `ck`.
