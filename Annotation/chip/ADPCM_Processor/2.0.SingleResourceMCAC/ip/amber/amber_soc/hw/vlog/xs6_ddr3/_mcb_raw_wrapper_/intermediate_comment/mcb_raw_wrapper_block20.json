    "block_comment": "This block of the Verilog code is about using an OSERDES2 module, which operates as a serializer to transmit parallel data to serial data form. The OSERDES2 has been configured for two data serializing mode set by the DATA_WIDTH attribute being set to 2. The selected input signals dqpum and dqnum are serialized and output through udm_oq, with the conversion clock ioclk90. Serial data output timing control is provided by dqIO_w_en_0 through T1 and T2, while control signals such as clock and reset are connected to the module with pll_ce_90 and int_sys_rst respectively. Additional feature controls like BYPASS_GCLK_FF is set to true, and this allows the clock input bypassing the GCLK FF. Various shifting options (SHIFTIN1 to SHIFTIN4 and SHIFTOUT1 to SHIFTOUT4) are unused so left unassigned."
