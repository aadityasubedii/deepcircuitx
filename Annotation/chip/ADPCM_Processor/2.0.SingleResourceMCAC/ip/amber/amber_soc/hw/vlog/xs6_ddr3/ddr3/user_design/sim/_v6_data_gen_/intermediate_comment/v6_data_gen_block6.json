    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional structure in the 'generate' loop that is used to set a distinct data pattern for addressing. If the data pattern matches \"DGEN_ADDR\" or \"DGEN_ALL\", this part of the generate block gets synthesized. The block exploits the flexibility of conditional compilation in the generate statement to modify circuit behavior according to the chosen data pattern."
