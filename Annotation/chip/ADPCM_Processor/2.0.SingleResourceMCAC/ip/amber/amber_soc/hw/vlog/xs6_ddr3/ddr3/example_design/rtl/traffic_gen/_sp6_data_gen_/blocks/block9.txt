This block generates a data pattern of a specific type when certain conditions are met. If the data width (DWIDTH) is 64 and the data pattern (DATA_PATTERN) is either DGEN_HAMMER or DGEN_ALL, a hammer pattern for a 64 bit width is created. The creation of this data pattern is triggered on the positive edge of the given input clock signal (clk_i). The implementation uses a generate-if construct to dynamically create this portion of the hardware design based on the mentioned conditions.
