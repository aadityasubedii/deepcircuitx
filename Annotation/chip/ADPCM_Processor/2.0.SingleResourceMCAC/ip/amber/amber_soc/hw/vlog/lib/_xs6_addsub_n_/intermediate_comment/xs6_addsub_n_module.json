    "module": "Module-level comment: The xs6_addsub_n module is a hardware unit designed for arithmetic operations (addition/subtraction) using the DSP48A1 block in Xilinx FPGA. It's configurable, supporting varying bit widths as determined by the WIDTH parameter. Module's inputs are two operands (`i_a` and `i_b`), a carry-in (`i_cin`), and a subtraction control flag (`i_sub`). Outputs are arithmetic operation result (`o_sum`) and carry-out (`o_co`). The functionality is achieved through preparing inputs (`in_a` and `in_b`) and operation mode (`opmode`) for DSP block, and processing its output (`out`) to generate desired results."
