    "block_comment": "This block enables the data clock signal when the EYE_TEST is set to \"TRUE\". It is implemented by using a generate-if construct to assign a constant logic high value to the 'data_clk_en' when the mentioned condition is true, thereby enabling the data clock signal. This functionality is encapsulated under the label 'd_clk_en1'."
