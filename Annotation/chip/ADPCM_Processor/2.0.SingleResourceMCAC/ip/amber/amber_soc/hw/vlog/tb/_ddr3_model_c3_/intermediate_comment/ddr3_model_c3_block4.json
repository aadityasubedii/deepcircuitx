    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs a timing check operation in response to the positive edge of the DQS signal for the 29th bit. The function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' is called every time there's a rising edge of the 29th bit of 'dqs_in'. This is achieved through the use of the 'always @' construct which makes the block sensitive to the specified signal transition, in this case, the positive edge of 'dqs_in[28]'."
