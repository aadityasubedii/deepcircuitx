    "block_comment": "The code block is a task in Verilog named 'warmreg' which takes a 4-bit unsigned integer as input identifier for a register (`regnum`) and writes the corresponding register's name into a pre-specified file (`decompile_file`). If the value of `regnum` is less than 12, it writes the register number directly. For values of 12 to 15, it writes special register names into the file; 12 corresponds to \"ip\", 13 to \"sp\", 14 to \"lr\", and 15 to \"pc\"."
