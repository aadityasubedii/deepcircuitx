Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog is responsible for a timing check function on a specific negative edge of a signal. The cue for this timing check execution is represented by the positive edge of the 22nd bit (system is 0-indexed) in the `dqs_in` signal. When a positive edge is detected, this activates the timing check function `dqs_neg_timing_check()` for that specific bit. The block effectively monitors for a change in signal and on detecting a positive edge, it performs a timing analysis on the state transition.
