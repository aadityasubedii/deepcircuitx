Module-level comment: This module implements a 512x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using four RAMB16BWER primitives from Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. It provides synchronous read and write operations with a 128-bit data interface, 9-bit addressing, and 16-bit byte enable. The module uses four 36-bit wide RAMB16BWER instances to create the 128-bit wide memory, with each instance handling 32 bits of data. The byte-enable functionality is implemented by generating write enable signals for each byte based on the input byte enable and write enable signals.
