    "block_comment": "The block is a generate statement that dynamically instantiates OBUFT buffers for memory bank addresses in a Verilog design. This is accomplished by iterating over the bank addresses as specified by the width `C_MEM_BANKADDR_WIDTH`. For each bank address, an OBUFT instance is created. It maps the input `ioi_ba[ba_i]` to the output `mcbx_dram_ba[ba_i]` and uses `t_ba[ba_i]` to control the drive strength of the output."
