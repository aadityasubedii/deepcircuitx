    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous sequential logic control which handles the signals related to ending a shift operation. It functions based on a clock signal (WB_CLK_I) or a reset signal (Reset). The logic starts by setting 'ShiftEnded' to 0 when reset is high. If reset is not high, the block checks for multiple conditions, and if they are all true, sets 'ShiftEnded' to 1, indicating the end of a shift operation. However, if a 'RxStatusWrite' event occurs (which could indicate a change in the receiving status), 'ShiftEnded' is reset back to 0. This block, through careful control and manipulation of ShiftEnded signal and condition checks, ensures the correct indication of whether a shift process has ended or is ongoing."
