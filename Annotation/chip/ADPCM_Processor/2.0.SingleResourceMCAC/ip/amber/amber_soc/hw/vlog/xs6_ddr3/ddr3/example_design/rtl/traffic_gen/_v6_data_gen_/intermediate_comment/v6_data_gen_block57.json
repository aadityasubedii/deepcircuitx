    "block_comment": "The block identifies if a specific data pattern is being used for a set number of Data Query (DQ) pins. To achieve this, it compares the defined number of DQ pins and the data pattern. If 24 DQ pins are used in correspondence with either \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\" or \"DGEN_ALL\" data patterns, then the block identifies this via a successful condition check, under the label \"WALKING_ONE_24_PATTERN\"."
