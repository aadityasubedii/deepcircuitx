The given block generates an acknowledgment signal for writing and reading operations when the WB  (Wishbone) clock edge rises. The acknowledgment signal (WB_ACK_O) is controlled by the condition (delayed by a time period Tp), in which it is active during a simultaneous write operation, or a read operation taking place during a write operation. Further, the block accomplishes this by utilizing logical operations between the 'write', 'read', 'not-queued for writing' signals, and the WB enable (WbEn) signal, all of which drive the acknowledgment signal generation.
