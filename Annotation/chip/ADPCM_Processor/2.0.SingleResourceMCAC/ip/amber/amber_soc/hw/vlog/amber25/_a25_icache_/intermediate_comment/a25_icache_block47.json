    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a conditional statement inside a sequential logic block that stores the incoming address into miss_address register. The always statement updates the value at every positive edge of the i_clk (suggesting it's synchronous design). The condition checks if the current state of the system is idle, represented by the \"c_state\" variable equalling \"CS_IDLE\". Only when the system is in an idle state, the value of the incoming address \"i_address\" is latched into the \"miss_address\" register."
