    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'afifo' module implements an asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue with adaptable depth, data width, and address size. It makes use of separate read and write clocks to carry out operations asynchronously. The module contains multiple input and output ports, including signals for writing/reading data, indicating full, empty, or almost full states. Inside, it uses signals such as 'mem' for storing FIFO data, and addressing along with read and write pointers implemented via Gray coding. Functionality is segmented into phases, specifically initialization/setup, capture, data write-read operations, and status updates."
