This block of code is a flip-flop used to synchronize the start signal for a read operation in a wishbone bus protocol. It is triggered at the rising edge of the input clock pulse. Specifically, this block of code takes the 'wb_start_read' signal and assigns it to the 'wb_start_read_d1' signal at every positive-going transition ('posedge') of the 'i_clk' clock signal.
