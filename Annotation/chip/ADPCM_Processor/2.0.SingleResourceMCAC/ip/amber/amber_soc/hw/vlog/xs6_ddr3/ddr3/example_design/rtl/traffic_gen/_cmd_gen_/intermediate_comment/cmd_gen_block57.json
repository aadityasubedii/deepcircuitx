    "block_comment": "This block manages the control signal 'first_load_pulse' for synchronization purposes in Verilog design. It uses the rising edge of 'clk_i' to make this assignment, and involves three conditions, all dependent on different inputs viz. 'rst_i[0]' and 'mode_load_pulse'. `first_load_pulse` is set to true on receiving the lowest order bit of reset signal, while it gets turned off when 'mode_load_pulse' signal is active. In any other scenarios, `first_load_pulse` retains its previous state. Delays are also managed by them with '#TCQ'."
