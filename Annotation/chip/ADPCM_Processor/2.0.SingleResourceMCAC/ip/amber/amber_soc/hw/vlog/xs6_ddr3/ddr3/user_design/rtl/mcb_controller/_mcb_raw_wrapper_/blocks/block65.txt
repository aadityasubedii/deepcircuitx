This block checks the enable status of port 1 and accordingly assigns the relevant signals to that port. If the enable signal (C_PORT_ENABLE[1]) is active (1'b1), the MIG's port-1 related signals (like read, write clock and enable, write mask, data, read/write error flags, overflow, underrun, full/empty flag, read/write counts) are directly mapped to/from port-1. Otherwise, when the port is not enabled, these signals are set to 0. This is the traditional way of achieving conditional port enabling in hardware design.
