Comment: 
The block of code represents a finite state machine transition in the state `UDQS_CLK_N_TERM_WAIT`. When the system is not busy (`MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` is low), the state machine stays in the present state. However, when the system becomes available (`MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` goes high), the state machine transitions to the state `UDQS_PIN_WRITE_P_TERM`.
