This block of code is a 8-bit shift register implementation using feedback taps for jitter sequence generation. Every positive edge of the i_wb_clk (i.e., input clock), the existing 7 bits of the jitter_r register are shifted to the right with a new bit generated by XOR operation of the 2nd, 5th, and 8th bits that is moved to the most significant bit(most left).
