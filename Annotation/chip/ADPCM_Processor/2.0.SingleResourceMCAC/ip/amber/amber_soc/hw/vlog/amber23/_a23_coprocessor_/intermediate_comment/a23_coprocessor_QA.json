It receives various instruction inputs and generates corresponding operations such as enabling/disabling cache, flushing cache, and updating different areas in cache according to the fetched opcode. It also handles case of faults occurring, storing the fault status and fault address. The module provides visibility into cache control, cacheable/updateable/disruptive areas and fault status/address by reading data from these areas based on instruction inputs. Additional functionality for debugging, involving displaying the status of write and read operations, is present when certain definitions are enabled."
