    "block_comment": "This block of code establishes the selection of different data and address modes based on certain conditions. While functioning under a positive edge-triggered clock cycle, an initial reset signal specifies the default data and address modes. If a modification trigger comes in, it then overwrites these selections based on values from 'syn1_vio_data_mode_value' and 'vio_addr_mode_value'."
