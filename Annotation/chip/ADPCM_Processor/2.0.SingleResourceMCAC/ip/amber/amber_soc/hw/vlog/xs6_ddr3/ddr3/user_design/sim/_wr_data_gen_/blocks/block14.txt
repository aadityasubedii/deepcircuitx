Comment: 
The block manages the `user_burst_cnt` (user burst count) based on a synchronous reset signal, command start signal, or FIFO status. When a reset is initiated (indicated by `rst_i[0]`), `user_burst_cnt` is set to zero. If a command start (`cmd_start`) is detected, the burst count is set based on the "SPARTAN6" condition, where `bl_i` is directly assigned to `user_burst_cnt`. If neither reset nor command start is detected, the `user_burst_cnt` is decremented by one with each clock cycle, provided the FIFO is not full (`fifo_not_full`). If `user_burst_cnt` reaches zero or FIFO is full, it is reset to zero.
