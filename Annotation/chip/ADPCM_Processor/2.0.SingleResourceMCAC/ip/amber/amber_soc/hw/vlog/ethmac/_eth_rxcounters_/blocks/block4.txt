Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for management of the Interframe Gap (IFG) Counter reset and increment operations in an Ethernet component. The `ResetIFGCounter` is activated when the receiver is in StateSFD and both MRxDV and MRxDEqD are true or the receiver enters into StateDrop, triggering a reset of the counter. Contrarily, `IncrementIFGCounter` comes into effect when `ResetIFGCounter` is not active and the receiver is in either StateDrop, StateIdle, StatePreamble or StateSFD while the `IFGCounterEq24` is not true, essentially, incrementing the counter while awaiting the start of a new frame and not exceeding a specified limit.
