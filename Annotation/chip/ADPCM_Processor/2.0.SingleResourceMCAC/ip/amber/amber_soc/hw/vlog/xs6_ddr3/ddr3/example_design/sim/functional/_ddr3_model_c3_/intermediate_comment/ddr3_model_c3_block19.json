    "block_comment": "This block of code triggers the function `dqs_neg_timing_check` on the negative edge of `dqs_in` signal at index 13. Using `always @(negedge dqs_in[13])`, it checks the negative edge transition for the 14th bit in an arrayed signal `dqs_in`. This functionality is vital in DDR memory communications or similar protocols, where data are sampled at falling/rising edges of a timing signal."
