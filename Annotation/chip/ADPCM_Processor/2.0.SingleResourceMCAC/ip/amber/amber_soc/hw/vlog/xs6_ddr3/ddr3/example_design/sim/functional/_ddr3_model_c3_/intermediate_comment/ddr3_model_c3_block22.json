    "block_comment": "The block of code is checking for a transition in the dqs_in signal at the 10th index (from high to low). This is implemented using the always@ construct in Verilog RTL to always monitor for a negedge (falling edge) of the signal 'dqs_in' at the 10th index. Whenever such an edge is detected, it calls the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function with 10 as an argument."
