    "block_comment": "This block's purpose is to assign value to the 'rdpath_rd_data_i' based on the 'FAMILY' and 'MEM_BLEN' values. If 'FAMILY' equals to 'VIRTEX6' and 'MEM_BLEN' equals to 4, then 'rd_v6_mdata' is assigned. Otherwise, 'mcb_rd_data_i' is assigned. The expression utilizes a conditional (ternary) operator in Verilog for the assignment based on the conditions."
