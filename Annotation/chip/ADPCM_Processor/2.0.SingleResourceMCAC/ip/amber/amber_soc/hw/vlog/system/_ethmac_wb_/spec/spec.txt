Module name: ethmac_wb. Module specification: Ethmac_wb is a hardware module described in Verilog RTL that manages the interfacing between two wishbone bus systems acting as master and slave respectively, and ensures the correct data flow between them. It takes two parameters: WB_DWIDTH (data width) and WB_SWIDTH (select-line width). The module handles data read, write, address, and control signals using given inputs and outputs. The input ports include address, select lines, write enable, write data, cycle line, strobe, acknowledgement, and error flag for both master and slave interfaces. The output ports also include the same features for both master and slave interfaces. Notably, the module conditionally generates assignments and data operations based on if the data path is 32 bits or 128 bits. Although the original design does not explicitly utilize internal signals, it employs logic processing within generate-if-else code blocks, conducting process directly to the inputs and assigning results directly to the outputs. Operating in two main blocks - one for a 128-bit Wishbone bus system and another for a 32-bit system, the module carries out conditional checks on the WB_DWIDTH parameter and accordingly assigns signals, using endian-based functions for correct data handling. In summary, the ethmac_wb module presents a robust blueprint for managing data transfer and communication between master and slave Wishbone bus systems, conditionally working with different data widths.
