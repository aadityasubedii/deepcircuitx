    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the conjunction (logical AND operation) of 'u_bcount_2' and 'fifo_not_full' to 'last_word_o'. If 'u_bcount_2' and 'fifo_not_full' are both true (1), then 'last_word_o' will be true. This suggests that 'last_word_o' is indicating whether the current word is the last one in a queue, based on the binary counter 'u_bcount_2' and if the FIFO (first in, first out) memory is not full."
