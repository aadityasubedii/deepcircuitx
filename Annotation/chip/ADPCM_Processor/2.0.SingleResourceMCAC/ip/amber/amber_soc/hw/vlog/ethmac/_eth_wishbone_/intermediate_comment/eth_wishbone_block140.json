    "block_comment": "This Veriliog RTL block manages the synchronous reset and update of BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync1 signal. Upon the rising edge of either the MTxClk clock signal or the Reset signal, a decision is taken. If a reset signal is detected, BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync1 is asynchronously set to 0, immediately clearing its status. In any other condition, presumably during regular operation clocked by MTxClk, BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync1 is updated to the value of BlockingTxStatusWrite after a delay defined by propagation delay 'Tp'."
