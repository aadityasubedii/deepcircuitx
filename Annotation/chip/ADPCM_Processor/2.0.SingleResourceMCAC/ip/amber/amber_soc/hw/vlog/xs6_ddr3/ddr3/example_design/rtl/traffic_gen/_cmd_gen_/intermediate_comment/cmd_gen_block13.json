    "block_comment": "The block primarily functions as a refresh timer. It generates a toggle signal for every positive-edge clock cycle depending on the reset signal state. If the 5th bit of the reset signal is high, the timer is reset immediately following the clock period defined by TCQ, forcing refresh_timer back to 0. Otherwise, it increments refresh_timer by 1 in every clock cycle after the clock period TCQ, effectively starting a counter."
