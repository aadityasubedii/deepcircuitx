    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily functions to make comparisons between the current address and the end boundary address in the system. It does this by triggering on the positive edge of the clock signal, where it checks if the current address (from bit 7 down to bit 0) is greater or equal to the end boundary address (from bit 7 down to bit 0). If the current address is indeed greater or equal to the end boundary address, the signal 'lower_end_matched' is assigned a digital value of 1 (or high), otherwise, it is assigned a digital value of 0 (or low)."
