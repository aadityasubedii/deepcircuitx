This Verilog code block primarily controls the dynamics of a memory interface system. If 'C_S5_AXI_ENABLE' is not active, it assigns values to the memory controller's interface inputs and outputs, connecting each port directly to its counterpart. Alternatively, when 'C_S5_AXI_ENABLE' is active, the block manages data communication with an AXI interface, firstly masking the addresses for reading and writing data, then using two modules: 'mcb_ui_top_synch' and 'axi_mcb'. It precisely synchronizes the 'calib_done_synch' signal using 'mcb_ui_top_synch'. Simultaneously, 'axi_mcb' integrates AXI interface to the memory controller, exposing additional parameters to fine-tune its operation. The block demonstrates robust design by catering for dual operational modes.
