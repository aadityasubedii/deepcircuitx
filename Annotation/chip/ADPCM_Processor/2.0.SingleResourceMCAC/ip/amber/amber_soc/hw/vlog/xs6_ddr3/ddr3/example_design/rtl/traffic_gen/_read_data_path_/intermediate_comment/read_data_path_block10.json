    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a sequential logic module in a Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) program. The block is designed to execute on the rising edge of a clock signal. When a reset signal or manual error clear signal is asserted, the block resets its data valid, individual data queue error registers, and cumulative data queue error register to 0. On the other hand, if these clear signals are not asserted, the block updates its data valid, data queue error, and cumulative data queue error registers based on the values on their corresponding inputs."
