    "block_comment": "This block of code performs writing, reading, and execution functions for specific input signals within a flip-flop triggered at the positive edge of a clock. After storing the current clock count, the code checks for conditions where a 1-bit signal is present and a 3-bit signal doesn't exist, servers as writing operation. In this scenario, it retrieves a 32-bit signal for an address, writes to a file, and records the data. Similarly, if different 1-bit and 4-bit signals are received, a read operation is performed. The next section presents the execution condition, where the interrupt/execute_address are checked to format and write the instruction execution. Here, an interrupt can be written or an execution instruction can be displayed. Furthermore, the code also covers several scenarios for different types of instructions (e.g., register operations, transfer, multiple transfer, branch, multiply, swap, etc.) to print associated arguments and handle specific situations like undefined instructions and software interrupts, recording statuses into the decompile file."
