    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the reception of data for the first wire of a multi-wire interface using the DQS odd signal (Differential Data Strobe in DDR memory, used to read/write). The always block is triggered at the positive edge of the dqs_odd signal for the 0th wire, calling the dqs_odd_receiver function for this specific wire, to handle received data."
