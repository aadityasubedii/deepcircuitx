    "module": "Module-level Comment: The 'a25_mem' module processes CPU memory requests, choosing between cache or external memory access. It manages memory stall conditions, cache flushing and controls cacheability. The module employs numerous input and output ports, alongside several internal signals, to handle data addressing, writing, cache regulation, memory reading data, requests to Wishbone interface, data validity checks, and byte enabling. It also utilizes a cache unit 'a25_dcache' for cache requests. The operation consists of different sections for address caching, data reading/writing, and memory stalling, providing an efficient design to process memory requests."
