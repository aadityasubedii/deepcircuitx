    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code represents a state of a finite state machine and increments the value of 'N_Term'. This is done by incrementing the current value of 'N_Term' by one and transitioning the current state of the system to 'LOAD_ZIO_NTERM'. This specific design may be utilized in counting or tracking the number of terms in a specific operation or process."
