    "block_comment": "This is a conditional OBUFT (output buffer) instantiation block that dynamically controls the On-Die Termination (ODT) behavior of DDR2 or DDR3 memory. If the memory type is DDR3 and either DDR3 RTT or DDR3 DYN_WRT_ODT is not turned OFF or if the memory type is DDR2 and DDR2 RTT is not turned OFF, the ODT output buffer is instantiated. The instantiated OBUFT uses 'ioi_odt' and 't_odt' as input and three-state control respectively, and 'mcbx_dram_odt' as output."
