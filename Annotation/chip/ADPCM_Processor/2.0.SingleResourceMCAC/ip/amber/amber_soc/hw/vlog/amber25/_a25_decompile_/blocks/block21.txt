Comment: 
This Verilog code block is responsible for tracking control flow changes in a core, specifically when a jump operation occurs. Tracked information is written to a file (`decompile_file`). In each clock cycle (`posedge i_clk`), if several conditions are met — including but not limited to instruction execution permission (`i_instruction_execute`), absence of interrupts (`i_interrupt == 3'd0`), a signal that the core is not stalled (`!i_core_stall`), and a valid program counter selection (`i_pc_sel != 3'd0`) — the code block triggers its function. Notably, it logs source and destination addresses of a jump (`jump from` and `jump to`), along with the values of the first two registers (`r0` and `r1`). The addresses and register values are obtained through the `pcf` and `get_reg_val` functions, respectively.
