    "block_comment": "The block of code primarily functions as a system reset and conditional register. It operates based on rising edges of the 'ui_clk' and 'int_sys_rst' signals. If the 'int_sys_rst' signal is high, it resets 'cke_train_reg' to 0. If no system reset is initiated, 'cke_train_reg' depends on the state of 'wait_200us_done_r1', 'wait_200us_done_r2', and 'uo_done_cal'. 'cke_train_reg' is set to 1 if 'wait_200us_done_r1' is high and 'wait_200us_done_r2' is low, and to 0 if the calibration signified by 'uo_done_cal' is completed. This creates a prioritized flag system for 'cke_train_reg'."
