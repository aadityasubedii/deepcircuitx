    "block_comment": "This code block is predominantly responsible for delaying the validation signal of an instruction by one clock cycle. It accomplishes this by employing a non-blocking assignment operator in a clock sensitive sequential block. The always block is triggered on every positive edge of the input clock. It assigns the `instr_vld` to `instr_vld_dly1`, effectively creating a one clock cycle delay for the assignment and adding to the original delay, as specified by `#TCQ`. This is critical in synchronization, such as managing read/write operations in digital circuits to prevent the undesirable effects of clock skew."
