    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is a conditional assignment for a comparison data output signal (cmp_data_o). The block selects the source of this output using a ternary operator based on the FAMILY macro's value. If FAMILY is set to \"SPARTAN6\", the output will be assigned the value of cmp_data_r3; otherwise, it takes the value from cmp_data_r2."
