    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional code segment generator, determining a certain Verilog design pattern to be used in based on the number of data queue (DQ) pins and data pattern type. If the number of DQ pins is 16 and the data pattern is either \"NEIGHBOR\", \"WALKING1\", \"WALKING0\", or \"ALL\", the generator initiates a pattern named \"WALKING_ONE_16_PATTERN\". The choice of the pattern affects the subsequent handling and processing of signals and data."
