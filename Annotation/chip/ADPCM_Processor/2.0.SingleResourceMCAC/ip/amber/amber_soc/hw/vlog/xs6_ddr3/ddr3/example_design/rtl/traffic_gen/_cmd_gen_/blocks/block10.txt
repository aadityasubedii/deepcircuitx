Comment: 
This block of Verilog code checks the mode of an instruction and if using a VIRTEX6 family device. Upon receiving the 'instr_mode_i' signal change, it raises an error and halts the operation if the instruction mode exceeds '2' and the device family is 'VIRTEX6'. The 'always' keyword ensures that the check is ongoing while the program is running, and the '$stop' keyword halts program execution when the specific condition is met.
