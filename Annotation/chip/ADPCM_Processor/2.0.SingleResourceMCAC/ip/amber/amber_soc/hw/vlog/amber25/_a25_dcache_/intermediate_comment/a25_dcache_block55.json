    "block_comment": "The block assigns a boolean value to `fill_state` based on whether the current state `c_state` equals the Fill state `CS_FILL`. Using the `assign` keyword, the block continually evaluates the right-hand side expression `c_state == CS_FILL` and assigns the result to `fill_state` during every simulation time unit or when `c_state` value changes. The `fill_state` will be true every time the current state `c_state` equals `CS_FILL`, indicating that the system is in a fill operation; otherwise, it will be false."
