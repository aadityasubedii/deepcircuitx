    "block_comment": "This initial block in Verilog is responsible for displaying certain parameters related to Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) timing at the start of the simulation. It calculates the UART period using the count of bit pulses and clock period, and also displays the desired UART period, the count of bit pulses, and the count of bit adjustments for reference or debugging purposes."
