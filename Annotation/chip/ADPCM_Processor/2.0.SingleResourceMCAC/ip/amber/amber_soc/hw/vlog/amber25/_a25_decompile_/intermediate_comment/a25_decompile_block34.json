    "block_comment": "The provided block performs the function of an instruction fetcher in a pipelined processor. On every rising edge of the clock (i_clk), the block verifies if the CPU core is not stalled (`!i_core_stall`) and if the present instruction is valid (`i_instruction_valid`). If both peripheral conditions are true, the block fetches the instruction by capturing the instruction (`i_instruction`), the instruction address (`i_instruction_address`) and the status (`i_instruction_undefined`) into corresponding variables for further execution (`execute_now` is set to 1). If conditions are not met, no instruction is set for execution (`execute_now` is set to 0)."
