The block generates the signal `TxRetryPulse`. It achieves this by performing a bitwise AND operation on `TxRetry_wb` and the bitwise negation of `TxRetry_wb_q`, with the output assigned to `TxRetryPulse`. This effectively causes `TxRetryPulse` to go high whenever `TxRetry_wb` is high and `TxRetry_wb_q` is low, typically signaling the need for a transmission retry.
