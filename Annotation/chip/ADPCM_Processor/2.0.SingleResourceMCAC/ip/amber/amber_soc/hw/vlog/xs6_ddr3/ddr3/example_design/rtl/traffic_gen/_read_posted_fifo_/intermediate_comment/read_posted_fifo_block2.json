    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block handles the initialization and status update of the 'read first data' (`rd_first_data`) register in a digital system. It executes on the positive edge of the input clock signal (`clk_i`). If a reset signal (`rst_i`) is asserted, the `rd_first_data` gets cleared or reset, overriding any former state. However, if the system is not empty and `empty_r` (probably a flag for checking whether the read operation was performed when the system/buffer was empty) is true, the `rd_first_data` register is set to high. The delay (`#TCQ`) ensures that these updates respect the timing constraint of the system."
