    "block_comment": "The block of code outputs a signal to indicate if data is ready by assigning `data_rdy` to `data_rdy_o`. It achieves this by using an 'AND' operation on `cmp_valid` and `data_valid_i` signals, ensuring that the data is ready only if both signals are asserted. The output is updated based on this computation, thus achieving communication synchronization in the data path."
