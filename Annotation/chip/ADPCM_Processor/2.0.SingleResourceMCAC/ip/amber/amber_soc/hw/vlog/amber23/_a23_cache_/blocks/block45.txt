Comment: 
This block of Verilog code conditionally assembles write data (write_hit_wdata) with reference to a specific portion of address space (i_address[3:2]). The output data is built from sections of the existing read data (hit_rdata) combined with the new write data word (write_data_word). Depending on the address input, different portions of memory are preserved or overwritten, enabling precise control over the data updating process within a larger memory structure.
