This block of code involves a delay element configured with a clock signal `clk_i`. By employing an always block triggered at every positive edge of the input clock, the `instr_vld` signal is delayed for a specific clock cycle defined by `TCQ` and stored into `instr_vld_dly1` for further computations.
