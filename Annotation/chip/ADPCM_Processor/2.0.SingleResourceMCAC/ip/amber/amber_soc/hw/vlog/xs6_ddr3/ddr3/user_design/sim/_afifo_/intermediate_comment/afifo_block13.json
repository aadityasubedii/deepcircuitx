    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for reading data from a memory array. The system realizes this function by using the 'assign' keyword to constantly update the 'rd_data' assignment. The right side of the equation directly indexes the 'mem' array with 'rd_addr' serving as the address, upon which it retrieves the value stored at that particular location. In essence, this piece of code implements a memory read operation."
