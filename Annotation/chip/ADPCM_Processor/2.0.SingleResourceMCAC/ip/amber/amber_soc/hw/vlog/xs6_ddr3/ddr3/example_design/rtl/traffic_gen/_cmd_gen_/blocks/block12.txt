This block of Verilog code manages a refresh command signal (`refresh_cmd_en`) primarily based on the refresh timer and a reset signal. Initially, if the 5th bit of reset input signal (`rst_i[4]`) is high, it deactivates the refresh command signal immediately. If that condition is not true and when the refresh timer hits the value '3ff' (1023 in decimal), it subsequently enables the refresh command after a delay of time unit `TCQ`. Moreover, if the refresh command signal and the command clock enable signal (`cmd_clk_en`) both are active, the code will disable the refresh command signal after a `TCQ` delay, readying the system for the next refresh cycle.
