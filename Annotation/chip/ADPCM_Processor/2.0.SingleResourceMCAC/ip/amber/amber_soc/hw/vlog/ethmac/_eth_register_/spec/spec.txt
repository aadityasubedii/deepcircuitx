Module name: eth_register. 

Module specification: The 'eth_register' module acts as a register for an Ethernet module with a parameterizable width and synchronous reset functionality. It possesses five input ports namely 'DataIn', 'Write', 'Clk', 'Reset', and 'SyncReset'. 'DataIn' is a bus input of the defined 'WIDTH' that is written to the output register when 'Write' signal is high during a posedge clock event. 'Write' serves as a control signal input triggering write operations at the rising edge of 'Clk'. 'Clk' is the clock input that mainly dictates the timings of write and reset operations. 'Reset' and 'SyncReset' represent reset signal inputs which when high, reset the output register to 'RESET_VALUE'. Among these, 'SyncReset' prevails in priority over the write operation unless a 'Reset' signal is asserted. There is a single output port 'DataOut', also of width 'WIDTH'. This holds the data written to the register or the 'RESET_VALUE' if 'Reset' or 'SyncReset' are activated. The internal signal in this module, 'DataOut', replicates a register function reflecting the primary functionality of 'eth_register'. It captures 'DataIn' value if 'Write' is effective during a posedge clock event. However, if 'Reset' or 'SyncReset' are asserted, it takes up the 'RESET_VALUE'. This module primarily comprises an 'always' block that encapsulates conditions for reset assertion or data write operation and updates 'DataOut' appropriately, based on a posedge clock or reset event.
