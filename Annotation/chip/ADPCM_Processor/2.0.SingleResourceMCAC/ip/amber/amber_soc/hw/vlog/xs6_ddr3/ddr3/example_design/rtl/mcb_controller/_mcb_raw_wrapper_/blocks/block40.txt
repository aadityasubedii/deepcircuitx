Comment: 
This code block is a conditional assignment module in Verilog where various signals are assigned based on the status of a calibration flag. If "C_CALIB_SOFT_IP" is not enabled, the signals DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL, MCB_SYSRST, and several others are assigned specific values. Particularly, it equips the Memory Controller (MCB) with various user interface (UI) commands, adopting no termination calibration ('gen_no_term_calib'). It also conditions the system reset with a wait period and the calibration flag. Furthermore, depending on the simulation setting ("C_SIMULATION"), there may be an initialization sequence.
