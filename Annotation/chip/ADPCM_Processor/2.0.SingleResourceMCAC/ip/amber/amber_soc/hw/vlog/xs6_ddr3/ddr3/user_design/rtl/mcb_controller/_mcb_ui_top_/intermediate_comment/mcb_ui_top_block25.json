    "block_comment": "This function serves to calculate the number of time slots based on the given port enable signals and port configuration. It initializes a counter (num_ports) to zero and iterates through all the bits of the port_enable signal. For each bit in port_enable that is set (1'b1), the counter is incremented. Finally, the function uses a ternary operator to return a value of 10 when port_config is 1 and the number of enabled ports is 5, otherwise it returns 12."
