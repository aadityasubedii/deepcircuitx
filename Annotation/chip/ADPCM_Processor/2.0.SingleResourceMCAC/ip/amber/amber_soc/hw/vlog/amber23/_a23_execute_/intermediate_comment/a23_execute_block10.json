    "block_comment": "The block serves as a sequential logic updater in which it captures and updates multiple signal states on the rising edge of the clock signal `i_clk`. Implementations are primarily conditional signal assignments that update signal states only when their respective update signals are high. For instance, `o_priviledged` getting updated to `priviledged_nxt` when `priviledged_update` is high. If the update signals are not high, the prior state of the assigned signals is preserved. The block features update operations for multiple modules including privileged modes, write access modes, address validation, status bit flags, and signal masks."
