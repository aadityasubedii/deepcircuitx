    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages conditional data pattern generation based on the number of data query (DQ) pins utilized and the specified data pattern. The conditional statement checks if NUM_DQ_PINS equals 96 and if DATA_PATTERN matches any of the predefined pattern strings (\"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", \"DGEN_ALL\"). If both conditions evaluate to true, the code triggers the appropriate sequence for the 96-pin data pattern generation, as specified in the section following this block (not shown here)."
