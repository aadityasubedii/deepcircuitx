    "block_comment": "The block of code implements a bitwise AND function between the signals 'upper_end_matched' and 'lower_end_matched'. It assigns this output to the signal 'tst_matched'. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog signifies a continuous assignment statement and computes the right-hand expression and assigns it to the left-hand net. It continuously drives the net 'tst_matched' with the result of the AND operation which signifies that both signals 'upper_end_matched' and 'lower_end_matched' have to be true (1) for 'tst_matched' to be true (1)."
