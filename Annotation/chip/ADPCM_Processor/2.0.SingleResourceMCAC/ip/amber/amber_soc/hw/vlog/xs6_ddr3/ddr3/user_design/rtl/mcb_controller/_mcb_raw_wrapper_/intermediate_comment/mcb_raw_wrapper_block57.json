    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages and assigns values for various system registers used in the read and write operations for the Mig_p5 module. If not operating under specific conditions, all registers related to these operations are set to zero, indicating null or no ongoing process. During enabled condition, status registers such as mig_p5_full, mig_p5_empty and mig_p5_count are mapped to their respective p5_rd counterparts for reading data operations. Conversely, write-related registers are bound to zero, showcasing no activity."
