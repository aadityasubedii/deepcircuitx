This block of code is used for checking the timing of the negative edge of the signal "dqs_in[22]". It does so by calling the function "dqs_neg_timing_check" in every positive edge of the "dqs_in[22]" signal. By using the always @ (posedge) construct, it effectively implements a rising edge trigger mechanism, thereby ensuring that the timing check only occurs at these specific time instances.
