    "block_comment": "This block of code is for the initialization and configuration of an SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) component. The initialization uses a hexadecimal format for the 36-bit SRAM value. The code also sets up the SRAM component to work with a Spartan6 device during simulations. The reset type, reset priority, collision check, and write modes are all defined. It does not allow register enable signals on the SRAM, effectively disabling write-enable control. The clock signal for SRAM is passed from an input signal, 'i_clk'. This shows that the SRAM operates synchronously with respect to the external clock."
