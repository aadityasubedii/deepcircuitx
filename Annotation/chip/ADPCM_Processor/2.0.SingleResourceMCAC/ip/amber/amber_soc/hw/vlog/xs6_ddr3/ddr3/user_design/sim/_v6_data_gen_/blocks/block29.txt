This block generates and assigns data for a Write-1 (w1data) signal based on the input parameters (data_mode and addr_i). It is designed to operate at the rising edge of the clock signal. Upon each clock tick, if the FIFO is ready or cmd_startC is active, and if sel_w1gen_logic is true, it uses addr_i to select the specific data generation function (Data_Gen or Data_GenW0) and assigns the output to w1data array. When the memory burst length is 8, it takes the previous data's certain bits and assigns them to the lower index of the w1data array.
