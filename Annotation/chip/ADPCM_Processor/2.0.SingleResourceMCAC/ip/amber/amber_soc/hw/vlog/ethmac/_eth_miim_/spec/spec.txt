Module name: eth_miim

Module specification: The eth_miim is an MII Management (MIIM) module for the Ethernet MAC (Medium Access Control). It serves as an interface between MII (Media Independent Interface) and performs read/write operations associated with the PHY (Physical Layer Transceiver) registers. It handles the clock signal, reset signal, control data, and status inputs and provides data handling capabilities via Mdi (MII data in) and Mdo (MII data out) ports. The module outputs status flags like Busy, LinkFail, or Nvalid and employs submodules like eth_clockgen, eth_shiftreg, and eth_outputcontrol for specific functionalities.

The module has Input ports such as Clk, Reset, Divider, NoPre, CtrlData, Rgad, Fiad, WCtrlData, RStat, ScanStat, Mdi and output ports as Mdo, MdoEn, Mdc, Busy, Prsd, LinkFail, Nvalid, WCtrlDataStart, RStatStart, UpdateMIIRX_DATAReg. Each serving a specific function related to the read or write operation to the PHY registers or handling the operation's control flow.

The eth_miim module also uses several internal signals to synchronize the operations internally and to serve as counter-checks or flags for the different operations happening within the module. Signals like Nvalid, EndBusy, WCtrlData_q1, WCtrlData_q2, WCtrlData_q3, SyncStatMdcEn, WriteOp, and BitCounter are encapsulated within the design for aforementioned functionalities.

The given Verilog code comprises sections that handle different tasks such as controlling and managing write, read, and scan operations, updating byte and bit operation counters, initiating and terminating operations, handling latch bytes and orchestrating output controls. Sub-modules like eth_clockgen, eth_shiftreg and eth_outputcontrol are integrated to manage clock signal generation, shifting operations, and output control respectively.
