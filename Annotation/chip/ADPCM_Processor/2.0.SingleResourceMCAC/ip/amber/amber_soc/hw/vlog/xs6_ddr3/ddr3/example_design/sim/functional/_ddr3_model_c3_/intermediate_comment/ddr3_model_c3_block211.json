    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a reset mechanism that sets specific conditions and checks for errors related to the reset event in a system. The always keyword means that the block is sensitive to the positive edge of 'rst_n_in' signal or reset switch. Upon reset, it will check whether the system time is less than a specified limit and if so, display a warning. If cke_in or clock enable signal is active during this time, an error is shown. Similarly, it ensures that the cke_in signal became inactive at least 10 ns before the reset switch was deactivated. The block also tests for a preprocessor directive 'MAX_MEM' to determine the value assigned to memory_used based on whether 'MAX_MEM' is defined or not."
