    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs data selection for a High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) generator. The code essentially assigns the \"full_prbs_data\" value at the selected \"SEL_VICTIM_LINE\" to the corresponding \"h_prbsdata\" at index \"i\". If the index \"i\" does not match the \"SEL_VICTIM_LINE\" or its multiples, the code assigns the \"hdata[i]\" to \"h_prbsdata[i]\". This decision-making process improves the flexibility of data manipulation in real-time, providing a mechanism for selectively updating the data stream based on control line selection."
