    "spec": "Module name: a23_fetch. \n\nModule specification: The a23_fetch module is a controller designed to handle the interaction between a processor and its cache memory as well as the Wishbone bus. The module uses several inputs to determine the nature of the operation and whether to interact with the cache memory or Wishbone bus. The inputs include the address to be accessed (i_address), a valid signal for the current address (i_address_valid), the data to be written (i_write_data), a write enable signal (i_write_enable), and other signals necessary to guide its operation, accommodating different modes, byte-wise operations, cache control, system readiness, and Wishbone bus interface. The module delivers outputs such as the read data from the address (o_read_data), the stall signal (o_fetch_stall), and necessary Wishbone control and data signals (o_wb_adr, o_wb_sel, o_wb_we, o_wb_dat, o_wb_cyc, o_wb_stb). \n\nInternally, the module uses signals like cache_stall and wb_stall to track the status of the cache and Wishbone bus, sel_cache and sel_wb to decide which interface to choose for a read or write operation, and cache_read_data to hold the fetched cache data. A cache write-back request signal (cache_wb_req) and an address cacheability signal (address_cachable) are used to manage cache write-backs and ascertain if the current memory address can be served by cache.\n\nThis module contains three major blocks of code. First, the assignments define the conditions under which different actions are performed. The selection mechanism for cache or WB is defined, the stall signals are set, and the data to be fetched is determined. Second, the instantiation of the a23_cache module deals with all cache-related operations, including reading data and stalling. Lastly, the instantiation of the a23_wishbone module handles all operations related to the Wishbone Bus. A detailed design of the a23_fetch module is defined, helping in understanding its functionality and operation.",

The module uses several inputs to determine the nature of the operation and whether to interact with the cache memory or Wishbone bus. The inputs include the address to be accessed (i_address), a valid signal for the current address (i_address_valid), the data to be written (i_write_data), a write enable signal (i_write_enable), and other signals necessary to guide its operation, accommodating different modes, byte-wise operations, cache control, system readiness, and Wishbone bus interface. The module delivers outputs such as the read data from the address (o_read_data), the stall signal (o_fetch_stall), and necessary Wishbone control and data signals (o_wb_adr, o_wb_sel, o_wb_we, o_wb_dat, o_wb_cyc, o_wb_stb). \n\nInternally, the module uses signals like cache_stall and wb_stall to track the status of the cache and Wishbone bus, sel_cache and sel_wb to decide which interface to choose for a read or write operation, and cache_read_data to hold the fetched cache data. A cache write-back request signal (cache_wb_req) and an address cacheability signal (address_cachable) are used to manage cache write-backs and ascertain if the current memory address can be served by cache.\n\nThis module contains three major blocks of code. First, the assignments define the conditions under which different actions are performed. The selection mechanism for cache or WB is defined, the stall signals are set, and the data to be fetched is determined. Second, the instantiation of the a23_cache module deals with all cache-related operations, including reading data and stalling. Lastly, the instantiation of the a23_wishbone module handles all operations related to the Wishbone Bus. A detailed design of the a23_fetch module is defined, helping in understanding its functionality and operation."
