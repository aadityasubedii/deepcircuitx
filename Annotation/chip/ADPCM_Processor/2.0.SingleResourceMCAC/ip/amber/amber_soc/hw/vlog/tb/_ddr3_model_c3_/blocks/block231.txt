This initial block serves for system configuration and error checking for BL_MAX parameters and BO_BITS parameters. It starts by checking if BL_MAX is less than two and if BO_BITS is greater than BL_MAX. In both cases, it will display an error message and likely terminate the program. Further, it sets the time format for simulation and seeds a random number generator. The block also initializes the counter, ck_cntr, to be zero for the forthcoming clocking operations.
