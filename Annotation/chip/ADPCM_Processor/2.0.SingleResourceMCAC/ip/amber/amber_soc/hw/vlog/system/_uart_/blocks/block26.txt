Line number: 
[349, 350]
Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for assigning the UART interrupt signal (o_uart_int). This assignment is done through a logical OR operation on two conditions: the transmission interrupt signal (tx_interrupt) AND the 6th bit of the control register (uart_cr_reg[5]), and the reception interrupt signal (rx_interrupt) AND the 5th bit of the control register (uart_cr_reg[4]). The interrupt signal goes high if either of these two conditions are true, enabling the UART to respond to both transmission and reception interrupts.
