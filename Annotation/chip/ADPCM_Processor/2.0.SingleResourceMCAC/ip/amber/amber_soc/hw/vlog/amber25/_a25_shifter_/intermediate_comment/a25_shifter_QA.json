The shifting can be specified for logic shift left (LSL), logic shift right (LSR), arithmetic shift right (ASR), and rotate right (ROR) operations. The shifting amount and the shift function are inputs to the module. Depending on whether the FULL_BARREL parameter is set or not, the module can perform either full barrel shifts or quick shifts. The output of the module is the result of the shift operation and the carry out from the operation."

This signal gets generated based on the i_in input, i_shift_amount input, and the mode of operation (FULL_BARREL or quick shift).\n\n2. lsr_out: This 33-bit internal signal is the result of a logic shift right operation (LSR).

This signal is generated by performing a rotation on i_in according to the i_shift_amount and the operation mode (FULL_BARREL or quick shift). \n\nThese internal signals represent the outcome of the respective shift operations and largely contribute to the functional architecture of the module.
