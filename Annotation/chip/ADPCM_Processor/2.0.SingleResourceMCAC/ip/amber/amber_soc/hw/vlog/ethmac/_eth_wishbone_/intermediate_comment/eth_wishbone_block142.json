    "block_comment": "This block manages the transmission status update process in a communication system. The signal `TxStatusWrite` is asserted when a transmission is either complete - indicated by `TxDonePacket_NotCleared`, or aborted - denoted by `TxAbortPacket_NotCleared`, given that transmission was enabled in both current and previous states (`TxEn` & `TxEn_q`). However, the operation is paused if `BlockingTxStatusWrite` is asserted, serving as a safeguard against simultaneous write processes."
