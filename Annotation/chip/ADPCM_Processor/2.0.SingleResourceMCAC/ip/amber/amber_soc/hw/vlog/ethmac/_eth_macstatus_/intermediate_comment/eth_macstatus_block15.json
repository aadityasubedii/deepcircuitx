    "block_comment": "The block of code essentially controls when a data sample should be taken. It implements this function by checking the binary OR of every bit in the RxStateData in conjunction with the negation of the MRxDV. Also, it checks for the condition when the first bit in RxStateData is true, MRxDV is true, and RxByteCntMaxFrame is reached. In either of these two conditions, the output 'TakeSample' is set to true."
