    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to manage data samples based on different modes in a Verilog design. Upon each positive clock edge, if the 'mode_load_pulse' is activated, the 'bl_out' variable gets the value of the 'fixed_bl_i', delayed by the time constant TCQ. However, if the 'mode_load_pulse' is not activated and 'cmd_clk_en' is instead enabled, a switch-case statement is executed. This block deploys three different modes: if 'bl_mode_reg' is 0, 'bl_out' becomes 'bram_bl_i', if it's 1 it becomes 'fixed_bl_i', if it's 2 it becomes 'prbs_brlen'. For all other cases, 'bl_out' defaults to 6'h1."
