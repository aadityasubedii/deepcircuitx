Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module implements a DDR3 SDRAM memory model, simulating the behavior and timing of a DDR3 memory device. It handles command decoding, address handling, data read/write operations, and extensive timing checks. The module has input ports for control signals (rst_n, ck, ck_n, cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank selection (ba, addr), data (dq), and data strobes (dqs, dqs_n). It also includes inout ports for bidirectional data transfer (dm_tdqs, dq, dqs, dqs_n) and an output port for termination data strobe (tdqs_n). Key internal signals include timing parameters, configuration registers, state variables, and counters for various DDR3 operations
