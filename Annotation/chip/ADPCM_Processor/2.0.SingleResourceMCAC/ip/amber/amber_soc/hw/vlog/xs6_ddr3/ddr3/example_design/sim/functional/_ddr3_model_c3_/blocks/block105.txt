Comment: 
This block of code appears to call the function `dq_timing_check` whenever there's a change on the 26th bit of the `dq_in` bus. This function is potentially used to perform timing analysis or checks on the specified bit, with the index '25' suggesting it might work on a individual bits of `dq_in`. The `always @` keyword implies continuous monitoring of the targeted bit and function call upon any change.
