    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to `data_address` variable based on specific conditions. If `write_hit` is true, then `i_address` (bounded by `CACHE_ADDR32_MSB` and `CACHE_ADDR32_LSB`) is assigned to `data_address`. If `write_hit` is not in effect but `source_sel[C_FILL]` is true, then `miss_address` (bounded similarly by `CACHE_ADDR32_MSB` and `CACHE_ADDR32_LSB`) is used. If neither `write_hit` nor `source_sel[C_FILL]` are true but `source_sel[C_CORE]` is, then `address` is used. If none of those conditions are true, `data_address` is then filled with zeroes up to the `CACHE_ADDR_WIDTH`. This conditional assignment is implemented using Verilog's conditional operator `?:`."
