    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for indicating a cache hit in a write buffer. The hit event is asserted when three conditions are satisfied: the incoming address (`i_address`) matches the address stored in the write buffer (`wb_address`), the Write Buffer Cache Ready (`i_wb_cached_ready`) signal is high, and the fill state is asserted. These comparisons and conjunctions are handled by the `assign` keyword in a concurrent manner, thus facilitating efficient system performance."
