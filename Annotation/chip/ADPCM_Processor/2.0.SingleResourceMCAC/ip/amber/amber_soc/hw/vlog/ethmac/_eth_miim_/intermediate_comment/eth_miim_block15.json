    "block_comment": "This block of code is a storage mechanism which controls a valid signal 'Nvalid' based on clock or reset input. When a positive edge of either 'Clock' or 'Reset' is detected, the block first checks if a Reset signal is present. If so, 'Nvalid' is set to 0 after a time delay(Tp). If not, another condition is checked which examines whether 'InProgess_q2' is off and 'InProgress_q3' is on, under which 'Nvalid' is again set to 0. If these conditions are not met, it checks another scenario where 'ScanStat_q2' is on and 'SyncStatMdcEn' is off, in which case 'Nvalid' is set to 1. This block of code is likely part of a synchronous digital system, where the status of variables is changed upon a clock or reset signal."
