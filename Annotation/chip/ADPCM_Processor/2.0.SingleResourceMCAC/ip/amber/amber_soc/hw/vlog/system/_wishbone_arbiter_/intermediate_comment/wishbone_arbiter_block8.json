    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning specific signals related to a Wishbone bus system for a master connection to slave 5. The implementation relies on the direct assignment of the values of `master_adr`, `master_wdat`, and `master_sel` to `o_s5_wb_adr`, `o_s5_wb_dat`, and `o_s5_wb_sel` respectively. However, for `o_s5_wb_we`, `o_s5_wb_cyc`, and `o_s5_wb_stb`, the current value of `current_slave` is checked, and if it equals 5, the respective `master_we`, `master_cyc`, and `master_stb` values are put in play, otherwise, a default value of 0 is used."
