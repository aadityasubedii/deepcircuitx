    "block_comment": "The block configures a datatype into a write delay mode within a memory cell. It sets the memory cell address to 'NegEdgeInDly' and the read/write bit to 'WRITE_MODE', indicating a write operation. The write data from the DQS (data strobe) delay line is set with initial delay. Further, it loads the 'IOI_LDQS_CLK' into the MCB UI address and validates the command register. Depending on the status of 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N', it either transitions to the same state or moves to the 'LDQS_WAIT2' state."
