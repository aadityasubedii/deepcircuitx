    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for executing the function `dq_timing_check` whenever there is a change in the 15th bit (considering 0-indexing) of the input data 'dq_in'. This is achieved through the `always @` syntax in Verilog that creates a procedural block which is trigged every time a change in the bit at the specified index occurs. The function `dq_timing_check` is called with an argument of '14', allowing for the monitoring and handling of timing checks related to the 15th bit of `dq_in`.\n"
