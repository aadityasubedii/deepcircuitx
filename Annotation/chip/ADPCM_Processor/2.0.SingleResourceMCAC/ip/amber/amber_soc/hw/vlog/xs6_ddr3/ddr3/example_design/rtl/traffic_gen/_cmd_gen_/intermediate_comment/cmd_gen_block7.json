    "block_comment": "The block of code checks if certain sections of the `addr_out` address have reached or surpassed corresponding sections of the `end_addr_i` address. Implementation consists of 4 if-else conditions which compare, on each clock cycle, specific chunks in `addr_out` and `end_addr_i`. If `addr_out` exceeds or equals `end_addr_i`, respective 1-bit flag (A3_G_E3, A2_G_E2, A1_G_E1, or A0_G_E0) is set high; otherwise, it's set low. The highest bits comparison is basic, while for the lowest bits, it accounts for the data width and the block count `bl_out`."
