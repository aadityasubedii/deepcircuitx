    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to create a counter, controlled by reset and clock signals, that will help in properly timing command execution. The counter, `wait_cnt`, increments by 2 when both `cmd_rdy_o` and `cmd_valid_i` signals are true, indicating that a command is ready and valid. It then counts down every clock cycle when `wait_cnt` is not zero. When the `rst_i` reset signal is asserted, `wait_cnt` is forced back to zero, effectively reinitializing the counter."
