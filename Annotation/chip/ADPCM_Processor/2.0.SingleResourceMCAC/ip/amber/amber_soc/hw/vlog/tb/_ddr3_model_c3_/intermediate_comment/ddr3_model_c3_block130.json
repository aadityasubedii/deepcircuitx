    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a timing check on the first bit (0 index) of the dq_in array. The always keyword in Verilog triggers the function dq_timing_check every time the first bit of the dq_in array changes. As a result, the block monitors dq_in[0] constantly and calls dq_timing_check(0) whenever this element fluctuates. Solid design practice assumes the existence of dq_timing_check function to interpret the result of each timing check in the context."
