The given block of Verilog code is used for assigning the logic condition which signifies whether a process or operation is ongoing or not. The Busy signal is set high or ‘1’ whenever there is any operation or process taking place in the system, indicated by the activity of any of the following signals: WCtrlData, WCtrlDataStart, RStat, RStatStart, SyncStatMdcEn, EndBusy, InProgress, InProgress_q3, or Nvalid. This is achieved through the use of the OR ('|') operator in Verilog which does a logical OR operation of all the individual signals.
