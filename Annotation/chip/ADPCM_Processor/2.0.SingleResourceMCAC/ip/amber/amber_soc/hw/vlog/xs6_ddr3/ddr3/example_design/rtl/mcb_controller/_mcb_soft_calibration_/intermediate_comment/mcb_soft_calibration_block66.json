    "block_comment": "This block is a clock-driven state machine responsible for controlling and initializing the dynamic calibration state. It operates on the rising edge of UI_CLK. The presence of a reset condition 'RST' will drive the 'State_Start_DynCal' to logic 0. In the absence of a reset, the machine checks the current STATE. If it matches the 'START_DYN_CAL' state, it sets 'State_Start_DynCal' to logic high (1'b1) indicating the beginning of dynamic calibration. In all other states, 'State_Start_DynCal' is kept low, signifying that dynamic calibration is not in progress."
