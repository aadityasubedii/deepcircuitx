    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the Delayed Cyclic Redundancy Check Count (DlyCrcCnt) in a Transmit Unit. Upon the positive edge of MTxClk signal or a Reset, the counter is reset to zero immediately. However, if the system is not resetting, the counter can also reset on certain conditions - when the second bit of StateData is high and DlyCrcCnt equals 4, StartJam is asserted or PacketFinished_q flag is high. Alternatively, if Delay CRC Enable (DlyCrcEn) is high and there's a Start Frame Delimiter (StateSFD) or the second bit of StateData is high and at least one bit in DlyCrcCnt is high, the counter will increment by 1."
