    "block_comment": "This block of code configures memory cell operation and manages memory control block command states. Memory cell addressing and operation mode are configured using `IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR` and `IODRPCTRLR_R_WB` respectively, with writing data stored in `IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA`. It then assigns `IOI_UDQS_CLK` to the memory control block's address, `MCB_UIADDR`, and sets `MCB_CMD_VALID`. Depending on the readiness/busy state of the memory control block, encoded in the `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` signal, it transitions to either `UDQS_CLK_WRITE_P_TERM` or `UDQS_CLK_P_TERM_WAIT` state."
