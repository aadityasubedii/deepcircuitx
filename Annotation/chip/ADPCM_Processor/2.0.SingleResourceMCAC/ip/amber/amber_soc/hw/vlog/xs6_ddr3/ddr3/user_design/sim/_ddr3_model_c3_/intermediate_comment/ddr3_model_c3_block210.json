    "block_comment": "This Verilog block manages the operations and detailed timing checks of a dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) system. It achieves this through various tasks and conditional statements that operate on the inputs, including the clock (diff_ck), reset signal (rst_n_in), self-refresh signal (in_self_refresh), and power-down signal (in_power_down). It manages timing restrictions on the clock edges and checks for any errors in the clock's state. It also handles different possible refresh or power-down conditions and performs many tasks based on these outcomes, such as adjusting the odt_state and/or dll_locked flags. There are various operational tasks performed, such as automatic precharging, command sequencing, and write levelization. This block also simulates the dynamic on-die termination (ODT) process, important for signal integrity during high-speed operations. Furthermore, numerous error checks are performed in this block to ensure correct operation according to the specified timing constraints."
