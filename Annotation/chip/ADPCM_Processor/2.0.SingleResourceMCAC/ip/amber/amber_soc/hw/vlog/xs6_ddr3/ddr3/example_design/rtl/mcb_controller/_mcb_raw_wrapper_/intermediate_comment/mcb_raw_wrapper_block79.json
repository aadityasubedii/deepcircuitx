    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as an error checker for command configurations in a write-only communication port (Port 3). It uses conditional statements to validate the command setup and checks whether the width of the C_PORT_CONFIG from 64th to 87th bit is \"W32\" (representing a 32-bit command), the command enable (p3_cmd_en) is activated (`1'b1`), and specific command instructions (p3_cmd_instr[2] and p3_cmd_instr[0]) are in the state `1'b0` and `1'b1` respectively. If all these conditions match, it signifies an invalid command setup for write-only port and hence, the block will output the related error message and cause the process to finish."
