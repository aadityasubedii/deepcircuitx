Comment: 
This block of code appears to perform the initial steps of a dynamic calibration process in a hardware system. The "First_Dyn_Cal_Done" signal is set to '1' indicating the first dynamic calibration procedure has finished. The state of the system is then set to 'START_DYN_CAL', implying the onset of the dynamic calibration process. This block is possibly part of a state machine handling different states of the calibration process.
