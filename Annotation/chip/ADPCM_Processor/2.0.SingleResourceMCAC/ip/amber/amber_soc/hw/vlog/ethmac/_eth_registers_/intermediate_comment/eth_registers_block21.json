    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the value of the signal `SetTxCIrq_sync3` synchronously with respect to clock `Clk` and the reset signal `Reset`. If a positive edge of `Reset` is detected, `SetTxCIrq_sync3` is reset and set to `0`, which indicates an asynchronous reset mechanism is used. If it is not the case (no positive edge of `Reset`), the value of `SetTxCIrq_sync3` will be updated to be same as that of `SetTxCIrq_sync2` upon detection of a positive edge of the clock `Clk`. This implementation is a typical flip-flop design with asynchronous reset."
