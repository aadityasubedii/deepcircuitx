    "block_comment": "This block of code declares a generate loop variable `addr_ioi` in Verilog. The keyword `genvar` shows that it is intended to be used in procedural generate constructs such as `for`, `if`, and `case` blocks. Generate constructs are elaborated during compile time to produce gate level constructs necessary for simulation/synthesis. The variable `addr_ioi` will most likely be used in such a loop to instantiate or manage multiple similar elements in parallel."
