    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code is performing a bit slicing operation to derive a specific address, referred to as mcb_cmd_addr_o, from a wider address, addr_o. It takes as input addr_o and uses bit manipulation, specifically extracting bits from position 0 to (ADDR_WIDTH - 1), to form the output mcb_cmd_addr_o. Thus, the function of this line is to generate a specific command address from a wider address input. This is achieved via direct assignment using the assign keyword and bit slicing of the address input."
