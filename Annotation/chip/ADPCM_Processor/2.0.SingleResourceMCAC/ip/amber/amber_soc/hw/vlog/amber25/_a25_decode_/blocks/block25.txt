Comment: 
This block performs instruction decoding. It inspects a 16-bit `instruction` vector and sets `mtrans_reg1` according to the position of the least significant '1'. Positions are zero-indexed from the right and reach up to 'e' (14 in decimal). Any command not fitting the specified format triggers the default case, setting `mtrans_reg1` to 'f' (15 in decimal).
