    "module": "Module-level comment: The module, a25_fetch, is part of a CPU design that guides the fetch operation of the instruction execution cycle. It chooses instructions from cache or main memory using given address and cache control signals. Stalls are faced on cache, conflicts or memory delays. Inputs and outputs are defined for addresses, stall conditions, cache controls and write-back stage. Logic is assigned for decision-making and signaling of data fetch and process flow. 'a25_icache' module is instantiated for cache-related functionalities. It's important part of a CPU for smooth data fetch operations."
