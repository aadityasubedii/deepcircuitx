    "block_comment": "This block modifies write-data for a memory burst length of 8. It leverages pipelining to manipulate each quarter of the 'w1data' bus separately. The manipulations include combining portions of 'w1data' with a delay of 'TCQ' applied. This ensures safe preparation of data before a write operation. Each 'w1data' quarter is modified by shifting and merging its existing segments timed by 'TCQ', presumably, the Clock Quality Time."
