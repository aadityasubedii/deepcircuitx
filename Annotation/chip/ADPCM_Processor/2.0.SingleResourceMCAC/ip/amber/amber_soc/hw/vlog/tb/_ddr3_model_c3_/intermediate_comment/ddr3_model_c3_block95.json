    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for tracking changes in the 36th bit (as it starts from 0 index) of the dq_in signal. It uses an 'always' block that is sensitive to any changes in the 36th bit of the dq_in array. Whenever there is a change, it triggers the function 'dq_timing_check' with 35 as the parameter, which presumably checks some timing constraints or performs operations relative to this bit."
