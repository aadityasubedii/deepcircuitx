    "block_comment": "The block of code determines if the Nibble count (`NibCnt`) has reached minimum frame length (`MinFL`). This is implemented using an assign statement in Verilog. The right side of the assignment statement is an expression that calculates a scaled version of the minimum frame length (`MinFL`), shifting its value by one bit position to the left (effectively doubling `MinFL`) and subtracting one before comparing with `NibCnt`. If `NibCnt` is greater than or equal to this value, `NibbleMinFl` will be set to 1 (true); otherwise, it will be set to 0 (false).\n"
