    "block_comment": "This block of code configures the termination impedance on both DRAM and DQ pads in its off-state. Initially, IODRP, CMD_VALID, MEMCELL_ADDR and WRITE_DATA are pre-configured. Along with this, input and output termination values are reset to zero. IODRP update flag is set based on the inverse of First_In_Term_Done. The completion of the operation is ensured through a state machine, if the IODRPCTRLR is ready (RDY_BUSY_N is high), the state machine remains in this state, otherwise it moves to the WAIT7 state."
