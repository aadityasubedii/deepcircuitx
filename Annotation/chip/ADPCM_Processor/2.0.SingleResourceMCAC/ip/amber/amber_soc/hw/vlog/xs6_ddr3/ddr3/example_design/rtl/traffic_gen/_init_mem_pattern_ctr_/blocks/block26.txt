Comment: 
This block of code is conditionally generating synthesis-time logic based on the target chip family defined by FAMILY macro. It specifically checks if the targeted family name is "SPARTAN6". If so, it starts a named begin-end section labelled "INC_COUNTS_S", indicating a part of the code designed for synthesis on SPARTAN6 FPGA. The implementation details are not visible in this snippet, hence can't be commented upon.
