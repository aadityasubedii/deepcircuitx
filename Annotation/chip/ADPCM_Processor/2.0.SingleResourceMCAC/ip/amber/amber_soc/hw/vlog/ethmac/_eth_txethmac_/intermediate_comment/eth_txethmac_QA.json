It manages various states and conditions related to the transmission of Ethernet frames. A variety of signals are taken as input for managing the transmit start and end of the frame, packet collision detection, under-run conditions, padding, CRC generation and many other parameters. The module creates output signals for indicating transmission errors, a successfully transmitted frame, abort conditions, retry conditions, and others. It includes instantiated submodules for handling CRC computation and generation of pseudo-random numbers."
