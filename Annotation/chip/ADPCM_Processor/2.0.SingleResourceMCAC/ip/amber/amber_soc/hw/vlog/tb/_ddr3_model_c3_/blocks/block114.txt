This code block is implemented for checking the timing of data signals. It primarily concerns the 17th bit of the data input vector `dq_in`. In this block, a procedure `dq_timing_check` is continuously called every time the 17th bit of `dq_in` experiences a change in its value, therefore monitoring the timings of transitions of this specific bit.
