    "block_comment": "This block of code relates to error handling in a \"read only\" port situation in a Verilog hardware design. When port 3, denoted by \"C_PORT_CONFIG[87:64]\" is configured for 32-bit reads (\"R32\") and a command is enabled via \"p3_cmd_en\" with a certain instruction set (\"p3_cmd_instr[2]\" and \"p3_cmd_instr[0]\"), the system performs an error check. If the conditions are met, the code displays an error message (\"ERROR - Invalid Command for read only port 3\") and terminates the program execution using \"$finish\". The `always @(*)` syntax denotes that the block will always execute upon any change in the inputs."
