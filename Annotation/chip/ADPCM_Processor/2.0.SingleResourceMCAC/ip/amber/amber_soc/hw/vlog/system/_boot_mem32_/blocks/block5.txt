This block serves as a conditional compiler directive for FPGA Xilinx. It determines the parameter file to be included based on the existence of certain macros. If the 'BOOT_MEM32_PARAMS_FILE' macro exists, the block includes the file defined by this macro. If this macro doesn't exist but the 'BOOT_LOADER_ETHMAC' macro does, then the 'boot-loader-ethmac_memparams32.v' is included. In the absence of both macros, it defaults to 'boot-loader_memparams32.v'. Fittingly, this block ensures the proper memory configuration parameters are loaded based on the specific design requirements.
