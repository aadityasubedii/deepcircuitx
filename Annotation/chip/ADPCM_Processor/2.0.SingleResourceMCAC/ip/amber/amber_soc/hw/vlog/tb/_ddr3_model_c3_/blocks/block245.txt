This block of code handles delaying the input signal 'cke' as it gets assigned to 'cke_in'. The delay is controlled by the constant value 'BUS_DELAY', and the assignment of 'cke' to 'cke_in' only occurs on the rising edge of the 'cke' signal due to the event control statement 'always @(cke )'. The delay represents the physical delay on an actual bus line in a hardware implementation.
