Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls the value assignment of the DRP_SDI signal. The signal DRP_SDI is assigned the value of DRP_SDO or DRP_SDI_pre based on the condition checked in the ternary operator. If the register rd_not_write_reg and DRP_CS are both high and DRP_ADD is low, DRP_SDI takes the value from DRP_SDO. Otherwise, the previous value of DRP_SDI (DRP_SDI_pre) is retained. This block essentially enables selective data input for the DRP module based on specific conditions.
