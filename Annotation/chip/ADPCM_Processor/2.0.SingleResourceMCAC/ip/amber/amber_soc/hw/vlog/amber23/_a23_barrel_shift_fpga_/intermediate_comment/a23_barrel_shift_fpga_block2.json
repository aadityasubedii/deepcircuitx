    "block_comment": "The function 'wrap' applies a wrapping operation on a position 'pos' with respect to a certain level 'level'. It does this by subtracting the 'pos' value by 2 raised to the 'level' power, effectively implementing a right bit shift. The result, truncated to the least significant 5 bits, is then assigned to 'wrap', thereby defining the boundary limits within a 5-bit representation."
