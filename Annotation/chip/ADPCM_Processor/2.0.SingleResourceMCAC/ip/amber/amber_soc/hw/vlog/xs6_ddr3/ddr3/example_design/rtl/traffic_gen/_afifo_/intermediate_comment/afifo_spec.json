    "spec": "Module name: afifo \n\nModule specification: The 'afifo' is an Asynchronous First In, First Out (FIFO) memory buffer module, based on Verilog RTL codes, with writing and reading operations designed to occur at different clock frequencies. Parameters for data width, FIFO depth, and clock delay can be set by the user using the DSIZE, FIFO_DEPTH, and TCQ parameters respectively. The module has a variety of input and output ports. Inputs include the write clock (wr_clk), reset (rst), write enable (wr_en), write data (wr_data) and the read enable (rd_en) and read clock (rd_clk) signals. The outputs include read data (rd_data), and full, empty, and almost full flags. The FIFO buffer is implemented as a memory array (mem), with several other internal signals handling read/write operations, storing temporary data, and converting binary and gray addressing. The code itself is structured into several blocks which handle processes such as read/write synchronization, data writing, data reading, address generation, and status management operations. The 'afifo' module is specifically designed to handle asynchronous data flow in systems with differing input and output data rates.",

Any write operation happens at a positive edge of this signal.\n2. rst: This is the reset signal. A high value on this port triggers resetting of the module.\n3. wr_en: This is the write enable signal. Write operations occur when this signal is high.\n4. rd_en: This is the read enable signal. Read operations occur when this signal is high.\n5. rd_clk: This is the clock signal for read operations.

The wr_clk and rd_clk signals serve as clock signals for write and read operations respectively. The write operation can only occur when wr_en signal is high and similarly, rd_en signal high allows the read operation to occur. The wr_data is the data that is being written into the buffer and rd_data gets the data that is being read from the FIFO. Full, empty and almost_full signals provide status of the FIFO. When the 'full' signal is high, it indicates that the FIFO is fully packed and cannot accept any more data. The 'empty' signal being high means there are no data left to read in the FIFO, and 'almost_full' high signifies that the FIFO buffer is almost full but not yet completely packed."

Parameters for data width, FIFO depth, and clock delay can be set by the user using the DSIZE, FIFO_DEPTH, and TCQ parameters respectively. The module has a variety of input and output ports. Inputs include the write clock (wr_clk), reset (rst), write enable (wr_en), write data (wr_data) and the read enable (rd_en) and read clock (rd_clk) signals. The outputs include read data (rd_data), and full, empty, and almost full flags. The FIFO buffer is implemented as a memory array (mem), with several other internal signals handling read/write operations, storing temporary data, and converting binary and gray addressing. The code itself is structured into several blocks which handle processes such as read/write synchronization, data writing, data reading, address generation, and status management operations. The 'afifo' module is specifically designed to handle asynchronous data flow in systems with differing input and output data rates."
