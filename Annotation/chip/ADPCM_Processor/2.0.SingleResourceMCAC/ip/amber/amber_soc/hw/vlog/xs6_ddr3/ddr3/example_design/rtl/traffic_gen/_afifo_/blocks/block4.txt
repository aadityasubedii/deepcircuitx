The block of code is responsible for converting a binary pointer (wr_ptr) to its equivalent Gray code (wr_gray_nxt). This conversion process is accomplished in two steps. First, the most significant bit of the Gray code (wr_gray_nxt[ASIZE]) is directly taken from the binary pointer (wr_ptr[ASIZE]). Next, a loop iterates over all the other bits, with each bit of Gray code computed as the binary XOR operation of the current and following bits of the binary pointer.
