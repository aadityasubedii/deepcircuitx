    "block_comment": "This block of code is a hardware-independent timing check for the 64th bit of the dq_in input signal. The `always` block is a procedural construction in Verilog which is triggered whenever there's a change in the dq_in at position 63. For every change in the 64th bit of dq_in, the function `dq_timing_check()` is called with 63 as the input parameter. This aids in monitoring and evaluating the timing specifications for input 'dq_in' precisely at the 63rd index."
