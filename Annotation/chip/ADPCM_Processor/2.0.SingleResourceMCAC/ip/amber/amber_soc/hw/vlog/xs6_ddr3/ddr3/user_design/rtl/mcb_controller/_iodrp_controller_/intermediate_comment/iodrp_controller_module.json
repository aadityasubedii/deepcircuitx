    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe `iodrp_controller` module provides control for IO read/write operations on a memory cell. It operates using a finite state machine (FSM) encoded in one-hot, allowing it to transition through address phase, data phase, and waiting phases. Inputs are used to dictate the target cell, data to write, operation type, command validity, etc. Outputs reveal operational status and carry out chosen operations. Internally, this uses shift registers for serial data transmission, a multiplexer for data selection, control signals to dictate operation flow, and others. The controller's functionality flows from an organized FSM architecture and the judicious usage of local parameters provides a more readable code layout."
