    "block_comment": "This block of code is a generate-if construct in Verilog RTL that is utilized to instantiate the 'valid_bits_2ways' labeled block only under a specific condition. The condition in focus here is when the 'WAYS' parameter equals to 2. The execution of this 'valid_bits_2ways' block is therefore conditional and controls the generation of hardware at compile time based on the parameter value of 'WAYS'. If 'WAYS' equals 2, the instantiation of the design under 'valid_bits_2ways' occurs, otherwise, it is bypassed."
