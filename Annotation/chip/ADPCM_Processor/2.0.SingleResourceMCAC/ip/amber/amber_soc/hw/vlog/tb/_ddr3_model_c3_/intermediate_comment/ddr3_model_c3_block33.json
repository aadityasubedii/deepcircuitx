    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a task for performing a negative timing check on the data strobe (DQS). The task checks for different operational timing violations, such as tWLDQSEN, tDQSH, tDSH, and tDS violations. These checks are implemented by comparing various timing parameters (e.g., $time, tm_dqs_pos, tm_ck_pos, and tm_dm) against respective thresholds (e.g., TWLDQSEN, TDQSH*tck_avg, TDSH*tck_avg, and TDS). If a violation is detected, it displays an error with details that include the time of occurrence, the violation type, and the bit where the violation has occurred. The task also includes a process to invalidate the latch on the bit if an invalid latching edge is detected. To summarize, the code is designed to monitor and check for the stipulated signal timing rules' adherence in a data transfer system."
