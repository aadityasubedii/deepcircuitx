Comment: 
This block generates a fixed-size address based on input 'fixed_addr_i' and data width 'DWIDTH'. It checks the command pattern 'CMD_PATTERN' and if it's set to 'CGEN_FIXED' or 'CGEN_ALL', the block generates an output named 'fixed_addr'. The size and format of 'fixed_addr' depend on the 'DWIDTH'. Different segments of 'fixed_addr_i' are selected based on 'DWIDTH' and padded with '0's to the corresponding data width.
