    "block_comment": "This Verilog task block is designed for packet printing in a networking flow, both outgoing (tx) and incoming. It reads a packet, identifies its type (Ethernet or ARP), and depending on the type, extracts and displays specific information from frames of the packet. For Ethernet packets, it further checks protocol type, handles TCP packets separately to extract, and displays header, body lengths, and sequences. It can also print the character representation of the TCP body if its ASCII value is within certain bounds or equals a newline character."
