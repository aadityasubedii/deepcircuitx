    "block_comment": "This block performs a synchronous reset of multiple register values in response to an input of the Reset signal RST and UI Clock signal UI_CLK. When the RST signal is given (RST = 1), or on the positive edge of the UI_CLK signal, the registers ZIO_IN_R1, ZIO_IN_R2, RZQ_IN_R1, and RZQ_IN_R2 are all assigned a value of 0. In essence, this block clears certain register values as part of a reset operation during each clock cycle when a reset signal is received."
