    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code triggers a timing check function anytime there is a change in the 20th bit of the input data queue (dq_in). The \"always @\" construct in Verilog creates a sensitivity list for the following block, in this case, monitoring the 20th bit of dq_in for any changes. When a change is detected, the following function \"dq_timing_check(19)\" is invoked to perform a timing check for the 20th bit. The literal '19' corresponds to the 20th bit due to 0-based indexing in Verilog."
