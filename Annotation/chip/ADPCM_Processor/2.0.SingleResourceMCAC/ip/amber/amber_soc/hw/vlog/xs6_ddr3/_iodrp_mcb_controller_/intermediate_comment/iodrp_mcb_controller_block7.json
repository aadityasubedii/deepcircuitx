    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is designed for reading data from a register. It operates on the rising edge of DRP_CLK. If a synchronous reset, `sync_rst`, is active, it resets the `read_data` register to a default state of '0'. If the reset is not active but the state machine is at 'ALMOST_READY3' state, it updates the value of `read_data` with the value stored in `shift_through_reg`. This is typically used in state controlled data processing systems where the data read operation is synchronized with the system clock and conditional on the state of the system."
