    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronous circuit, with state variables 'RxAbort_sync1' and 'RxAbort_wb'. On every rising edge of 'wb_clk_i' or 'wb_rst_i', the circuit evaluates. If 'wb_rst_i' is High (reset state), it asynchronously sets the state variables to zero. If not in reset state (normal operating state), 'RxAbort_sync1' and 'RxAbort_wb' are synchronously updated with the value of 'RxAbort_latch' and 'RxAbort_sync1' respectively. The scheduled non-blocking assignments ('<=') ensure sequential state updates. Importantly, '#Tp' represents propagation delay emulating real-world hardware behavior."
