    "block_comment": "The block of code, written in Verilog RTL, is responsible for triggering the `cmd_addr_timing_check` function every time there's a change in the value of the second bit `\n(addr_in[1])` of `addr_in`. The `cmd_addr_timing_check` function is executed with 8 as an argument. The `always` keyword indicates that this should happen continuously during simulation, whenever the enumerated condition occurs.\n"
