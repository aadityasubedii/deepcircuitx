    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a state machine controller. At every positive edge of the input clock, if the reset signal is high, the controller sets the current state to the default state '00001'. Otherwise, the state is updated to the value of the next state. It ensures that the state machine is always in the expected state whether it's a fresh start or during normal operation."
