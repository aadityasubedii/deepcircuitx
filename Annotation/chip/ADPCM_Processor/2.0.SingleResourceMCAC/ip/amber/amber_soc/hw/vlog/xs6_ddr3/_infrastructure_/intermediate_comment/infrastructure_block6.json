    "block_comment": "The block is a Sequential Logic driving the `powerup_pll_locked` signal based on other input conditions. As it is an always block, it is triggered at every positive edge of the `mcb_drp_clk` or `sys_rst`. Initially, when `sys_rst` undergoes a positive edge, it will reset the `powerup_pll_locked` signal to '0'. If this is not the case and the `bufpll_mcb_locked` is true, it will set the `powerup_pll_locked` signal to '1'. This block essentially ensures the proper initialization and functioning of the system by controlling the Power Up PLL Locked indicator."
