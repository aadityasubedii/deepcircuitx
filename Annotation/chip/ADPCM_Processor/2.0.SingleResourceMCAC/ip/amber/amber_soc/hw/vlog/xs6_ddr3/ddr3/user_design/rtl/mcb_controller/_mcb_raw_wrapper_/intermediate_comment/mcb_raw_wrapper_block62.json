    "block_comment": "This block of code configures the data write process for the 'p3' port of a memory interface generator (MIG) when C_PORT_CONFIG parameters are equal to the specified values and C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is enabled. If C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is '1', it assigns the write-related signals (clock, data, mask, enable signal, full, empty, underrun, count, error) of 'p3' port to corresponding 'mig' variables. In case of disable signal, it assigns all above mentioned signals of the 'p3' port to '0'. Irrespective of enable or disable, all the read-related signals (overflow, error, full, empty, count, data) of 'p3' port are reset to '0'."
