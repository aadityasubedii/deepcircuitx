    "block_comment": "The block of code triggers a DQS (Data Strobe) positive edge timing check whenever there is a negative edge detected in the 18th bit of the 'dqs_in' signal. This is implemented through an 'always' block, that makes use of the '@' sensitivity list for re-evaluating the block at every negative edge of the specified bit of the 'dqs_in' signal and calls the function 'dqs_pos_timing_check' with the index '17' as an argument."
