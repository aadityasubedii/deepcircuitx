    "block_comment": "The Verilog code block instantiates a module called v6_data_gen, only if the chip family is VIRTEX6. Depending on different input signals and parameters like address width, burst length, or data pattern, v6_data_gen is expected to generate data. These inputs/parameters control the amount and pattern of data being produced. Several control signals like cmd_startA, cmd_startB, etc. and the reset signal (rst_i) orchestrate the start of data generation. The data generation status is indicated by data_rdy_i (data ready signal), and the generated data itself is output through data_o pin. The user_burst_cnt tracks the number of burst cycles, while the data_o provides the generated data."
