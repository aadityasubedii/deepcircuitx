    "block_comment": "This code block is a task for reading data from memory in the Verilog code. It takes inputs for bank, row, and column and returns the read data. Depending on if MAX_MEM is defined or not, the address is calculated either by concatenating row and column or by concatenating bank, row, and column all divided by BL_MAX. In the case of MAX_MEM being defined, data is read from a file indexed by the bank and address. Conversely, when MAX_MEM isn't defined, data is read from the memory indexed by a retrieved index, or, if the index is invalid, set as unknown."
