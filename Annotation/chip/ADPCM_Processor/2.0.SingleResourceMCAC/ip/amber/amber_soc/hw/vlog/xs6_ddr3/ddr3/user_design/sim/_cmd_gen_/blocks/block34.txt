Comment: 
The block is primarily responsible for determining the output address (`addr_out`) based on the input trigger signals, such as the clock (`clk_i`) and reset (`rst_i`). If the system is reset (`rst_i[3]` is high), the output address is set to the start address (`start_addr_i`), processed with a delay specified by the Test Clock Quality (`TCQ`). When not in reset state, the `addr_out` changes based on `addr_mode_reg` value. Different machine states represented by combinations from `3'b000` to `3'b101` drive the `addr_out` to various sources like `bram_addr_i`, `fixed_addr`, `prbs_addr`, `seq_addr` or combinations of these. The default condition results in `addr_out` being set to 0.
