Module-level comment: 
/*
 * This module implements a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) in Xilinx FPGAs.
 * It supports up to 6 ports configurable as native MCB or AXI interfaces, manages clock distribution,
 * handles arbitration between ports, and interfaces with external memory. The module instantiates
 * a raw MCB wrapper and optionally AXI-to-MCB bridges for each port, providing flexible memory
 * access in complex FPGA designs. It includes logic for clock management, memory calibration,
 * and supports various memory types and configurations.
