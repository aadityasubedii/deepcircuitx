Module-level comment: 

The "eth_rxcounters" module manages decoding counters for an Ethernet receiver. It uses inputs MRxDV, State signals, DlyCrcEn, etc. to manipulate ByteCnt, IFGCounter, and DlyCrcCnt. ByteCnt reflects the byte count of a received Ethernet frame, IFGCounter tracks the Interframe Gap, while DlyCrcCnt aids in cyclic redundancy checks. Activities include byte counting (incrementing or resetting), tracking the Interframe Gap, and undertaking CRC checks conditioned by dynamic inputs. Outputs include ByteCnt and IFGCounter states and CRC counter value for further processing.
