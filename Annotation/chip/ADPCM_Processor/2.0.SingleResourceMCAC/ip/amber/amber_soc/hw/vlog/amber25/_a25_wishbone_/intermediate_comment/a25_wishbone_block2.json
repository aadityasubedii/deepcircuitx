    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing data transfer on the positive edge of the clock whenever a 'new_access' request is made. The weighted buffer ('wbuf')'s validity is checked, and based on the earliest valid buffer, data and relevant control signals are assigned for the wishbone bus, pending the serving_port indication. If no valid buffers are spotted, all output signals are reset, and the serving_port value is switched off, signifying no active data transfer."
