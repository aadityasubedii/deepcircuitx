This block constitutes a configuration generator for a memory read data path or write-only path, depending on the predefined "PORT_MODE". If the "PORT_MODE" is set to "RD_MODE" or "BI_MODE", it initiates the 'read_data_path' module with a number of parameters regarding memory burst length, address width, data pattern, etc. It also maps internal states and signals to their respective inputs and outputs, which includes clock, reset, command validation, address inputs, data validation, etc. However, if the "PORT_MODE" is dedicated to writing, the generator simply nullifies the 'cmp_error' signal indicating there is no error in the write-only path.
