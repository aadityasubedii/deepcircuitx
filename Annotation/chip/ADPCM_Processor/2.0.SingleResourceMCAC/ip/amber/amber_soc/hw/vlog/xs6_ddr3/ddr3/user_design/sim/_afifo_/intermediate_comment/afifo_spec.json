    "spec": "Module name: afifo. \n\nModule specification: The module 'afifo' is an asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory system with adaptable parameters for depth size, data width, and address size. It operates asynchronously under separate clocks for write and read operations thereby enabling data writing and reading at different frequencies. It uses Gray code for addressing and tracking read and write positions. \n\nThe input ports include write clock (wr_clk) which sets the write rate, reset signal (rst) for initial setting, write enable signal (wr_en) for allowing data write, write data (wr_data) which is the data written into the queue, read enable (rd_en) for allowing data read, and read clock (rd_clk) setting the read rate. The output ports include read data (rd_data) being the data read from the queue, and status signals such as full, empty, and almost_full indicating the queue's full, empty, and near full states, respectively.\n\nInternally, the module employs the use of Gray code mechanism with signals such as rd_gray and wr_gray for tracking reading and writing operations. Signals such as rd_ptr, wr_ptr hold the current read and write positions, while rd_capture_ptr and wr_capture_ptr hold the current read and write pointers. Variables such as buf_avail and buf_filled give an idea about the buffer space status. Variables wr_addr and rd_addr indicate the write and read addresses within the queue, and 'mem' acts as the memory space for the FIFO data.\n\nSignificant code sections in the module include initialize and setup phase, capture phase, data write-read operations, and status updates with each step being handled by different sections of the code. The use of Gray code prevents issues arising from asynchronous operation, helping in smooth and efficient operation of the FIFO queue. The module is well-structured to provide robust and efficient operation in carrying out the operations of writing data to and reading data from the FIFO depending upon the respective enable signals, and giving an idea about the status and availability of the memory space, all the while maintaining good asynchronous operation.",

The module also contains provisions for writing to and reading from the FIFO, and controls for write and read enablement, reset, write and read clocks.

It operates asynchronously under separate clocks for write and read operations thereby enabling data writing and reading at different frequencies. It uses Gray code for addressing and tracking read and write positions. \n\nThe input ports include write clock (wr_clk) which sets the write rate, reset signal (rst) for initial setting, write enable signal (wr_en) for allowing data write, write data (wr_data) which is the data written into the queue, read enable (rd_en) for allowing data read, and read clock (rd_clk) setting the read rate. The output ports include read data (rd_data) being the data read from the queue, and status signals such as full, empty, and almost_full indicating the queue's full, empty, and near full states, respectively.\n\nInternally, the module employs the use of Gray code mechanism with signals such as rd_gray and wr_gray for tracking reading and writing operations. Signals such as rd_ptr, wr_ptr hold the current read and write positions, while rd_capture_ptr and wr_capture_ptr hold the current read and write pointers. Variables such as buf_avail and buf_filled give an idea about the buffer space status. Variables wr_addr and rd_addr indicate the write and read addresses within the queue, and 'mem' acts as the memory space for the FIFO data.\n\nSignificant code sections in the module include initialize and setup phase, capture phase, data write-read operations, and status updates with each step being handled by different sections of the code. The use of Gray code prevents issues arising from asynchronous operation, helping in smooth and efficient operation of the FIFO queue. The module is well-structured to provide robust and efficient operation in carrying out the operations of writing data to and reading data from the FIFO depending upon the respective enable signals, and giving an idea about the status and availability of the memory space, all the while maintaining good asynchronous operation."
