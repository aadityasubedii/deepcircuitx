    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the reception of data through a Data Strobe (DQS) for odd cycles of a memory interface in a synchronous digital system. A rising edge triggered always block is used to call the function 'dqs_odd_receiver' at every positive edge of the signal 'dqs_odd[1]'. This means everytime there's a transition from low to high in the 'dqs_odd[1]' signal, the 'dqs_odd_receiver' function with parameter 1 is executed."
