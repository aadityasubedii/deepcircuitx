    "block_comment": "This block of code defines an instance of the `tg_status` module. This module is designed for error checking and handling in hardware designs. The `tg_status` module receives various inputs such as clock signal, reset signal, manual error clear signal, data error signal, comparator data, read data, comparator address, comparator block signals, as well as full and empty flag signals from the memory controller buffer. Upon executing, it provides two outputs: error status and error values. Through the internal implementation of the `tg_status` module, errors in the data, operation, or communication in a system could be detected and properly managed."
