This function selects and returns a 32-bit signal based on the 3-bit input 'num'. The function employs a 'case' statement to map different 'num' values into distinct 32-bit signals - when 'num' is 0, it returns the PC next of execute unit (U_EXECUTE.pc_nxt); when 'num' is 1 or 2, the address from fetch unit (U_FETCH.i_address) is returned; for 'num' being 3, it returns the write data from cache unit (U_CACHE.i_write_data); and for 'num' as 4, the read data from decode unit (U_DECODE.i_read_data) is returned.
