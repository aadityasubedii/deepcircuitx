    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to handle a calibration process and provide pass or fail status. It first waits until a 'calibration done' signal (calib_done) before indicating that the calibration is completed. It then waits for a period and checks if there are any errors by probing the 'error' signal. If there are no errors, it announces a passed test; otherwise, it signifies a failed test due to data error, and then the 'calibration_done' block is disabled to terminate the process. In parallel, the 'calib_not_done' block waits for a longer period. If the 'calibration done' signal is still not raised well after the expected time, it concludes that the test failed because the initialization did not complete, subsequently disabling the 'calibration_done' block and then terminating the process."
