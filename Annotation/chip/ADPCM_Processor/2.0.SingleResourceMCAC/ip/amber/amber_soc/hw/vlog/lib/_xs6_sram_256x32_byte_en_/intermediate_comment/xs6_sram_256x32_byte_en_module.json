    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThis Verilog module, \"xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en\", simulates a 256x32 byte-enabled SRAM using a Xilinx Block RAM (RAMB8BWER). It performs clock-synchronized read/write operations controlled by input signals. Byte-wise control is provided through the \"i_byte_enable\" port. Unused internals \"nc31\", \"nc32\", \"nc33\", and \"nc22\" can be artifacts or placeholders. Write-enable to Block RAM is achieved using a bitwise AND on \"i_write_enable\" and \"i_byte_enable\". The code includes a verification block for input parameter integrity."
