    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a conditional clock input implementation. If the clock type specified is differential, an IBUFGDS buffer is instantiated to handle the differential clock inputs (sys_clk_p, sys_clk_n) and produce a single ended output (sys_clk_ibufg), with the .DIFF_TERM attribute set as \"True\". If a single-ended clock input is specified, the block currently contains no specific logic, which could be filled with single-ended clock processing details."
