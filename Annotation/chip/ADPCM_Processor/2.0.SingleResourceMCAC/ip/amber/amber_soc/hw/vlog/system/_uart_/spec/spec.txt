Module name: uart. Module specification: This module implements a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface with configurable baud rates, FIFO buffers for TX and RX operations, and Wishbone bus interface. It handles both transmission and reception of serial data, supports flow control (CTS/RTS), and provides interrupt signals for TX and RX events. The module has input ports for clock (i_clk), Wishbone bus control and data (i_wb_*), and UART inputs (i_uart_cts_n, i_uart_rxd). Output ports include Wishbone bus responses (o_wb_*), UART outputs (o_uart_txd, o_uart_rts_n), and an interrupt signal (o_uart_int). Internal signals manage FIFO operations, TX/RX state machines, timing control, and various
