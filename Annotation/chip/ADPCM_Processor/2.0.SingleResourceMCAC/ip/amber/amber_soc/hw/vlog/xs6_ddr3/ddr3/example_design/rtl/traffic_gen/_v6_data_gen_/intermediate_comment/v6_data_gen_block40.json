    "block_comment": "The code block is a conditional data pattern generator with 72 Data Query (DQ) pins. It leverages the 'generate' and 'always@' statements to create different data patterns, walking 1, walking 0, all among others, depending on the condition met. The if statement checks if the DQ pin count is 72 and the data pattern specified is either \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\". If this is true, at every positive clock edge, the 'WALKING_ONE_72_PATTERN' block is executed to generate the desired data pattern."
