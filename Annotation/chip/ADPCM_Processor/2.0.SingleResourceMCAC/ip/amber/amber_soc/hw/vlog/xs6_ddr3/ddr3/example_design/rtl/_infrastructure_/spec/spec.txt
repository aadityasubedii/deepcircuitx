Module name: infrastructure.
Module specification: The 'infrastructure' is a Verilog RTL module designed for a clocking infrastructure and a reset synchronization circuit in a digital system. It takes as inputs system clock (sys_clk, sys_clk_p, sys_clk_n) and reset (sys_rst_i) signals and generates multiple clock (clk0, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90) and reset (rst0, async_rst) signals. It features a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) that aids in the generation of various clock frequencies, and a synchronization mechanism to align the reset signals with the clocks, eliminating potential metastability issues.

The module relies on internal signals like clk_2x_0, clk_2x_180 (for doubled and 180 degrees phase-shifted clock), sys_rst (internal system reset), locked (PLL's status), rst0_sync_r (reset signal vector synced with clk0), powerup_pll_locked (shutdown signal for PLL), and sys_clk_ibufg (output from input clock buffer) among others, to execute its functionalities.

The code is organized into several blocks. The 'generate' block determines the application of either differential or single-ended system clock. The PLL instantiation initializes the parameters and generates multiple clock frequencies. Buffers are applied to clock signals for reducing skew and effective fan-out across the FPGA. The 'always' blocks deal with the synchronization of reset signals with the clk0 and mcb_drp_clk. Finally, a BUFPLL_MCB block that provides clock and strobe signals to the Multi Controller Buses (MCB) in the Xilinx FPGA is used.
