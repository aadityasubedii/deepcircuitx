    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for configuring the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) interface to write edge-induced delay settings into an IO Delay Reduction Macro Processor (IODRMP) control register. It sets the memory cell address (`IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR`) to a negative edge-induced delay constant, specifies a write operation mode (`IODRPCTRLR_R_WB`), sets the initial delay data (`IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA`), and specifies the user interface address (`MCB_UIADDR`) to be an LDQS clock. It then signals that this command is ready to be executed by asserting the `MCB_CMD_VALID` bit. If the memory controller buffer (MCB) is ready (`MCB_RDY_BUSY_N`), it stays in the current state (`LDQS_WRITE_NEG_INDELAY`). Otherwise, it transitions to the `LDQS_WAIT2` state for the MCB to be ready to receive further command."
