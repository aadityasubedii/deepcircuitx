Module name: iodrp_mcb_controller. 

Module specification: The iodrp_mcb_controller is a Verilog module that implements a controller for the Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) in memory control blocks. It orchestrates reading and writing statuses, manages address and data phase transitions, and deals with timing essential for system-memory communication. The module handles command validity and mode of operation, with its ability to switch between broadcast and non-broadcast modes. It interfaces the DRP via vital signals, such as 'DRP_SDI', 'DRP_SDO', 'DRP_CLK', and uses an internal Finite State Machine (FSM) for sequencing operations.

The module has input ports like 'memcell_address' for memory cell address, 'write_data' for data to write, and 'rd_not_write' for deciding read or write operations based on asserted value. It takes 'cmd_valid' to indicate command validity, 'use_broadcast' for mode selection, 'drp_ioi_addr' for the DRP address, 'sync_rst' for synchronous reset, and 'DRP_CLK' and 'DRP_SDO' for clock and data signals for DRP. Output ports include 'read_data' for the read data, 'rdy_busy_n' to signal readiness for new commands, 'DRP_CS' for enabling/disabling DRP, 'DRP_SDI' for data input to DRP, 'DRP_ADD' for starting data phase in DRP, 'DRP_BKST' for initiating a backward broadcast, and 'MCB_UIREAD' for user-initiated read commands.

Internally, the iodrp_mcb_controller module uses several signals and registers for working. For instance, 'memcell_addr_reg' and 'data_reg' for memory address and data storage, 'shift_through_reg' to hold shifted data, and 'load_shift_n' to control loading data into 'shift_through_reg'. It also uses 'addr_data_sel_n' for selecting address and data phases, 'bit_cnt' for bit counting during address and data phases, and flags such as 'rd_not_write_reg' and 'AddressPhase' to maintain state information.

The main sections of the code include tasks for shifting and data management, cases for addressing memory and IO interface, an FSM for procedural control, and the essential always blocks for clock-locked operations. These are meticulously designed to handle all possible sequences of data reading, writing and phasing out to DRP.
