    "block_comment": "This block manages the status of received pause frames in Ethernet communication. Under a synchronous system clock or reset condition, it resets the `ReceivedPauseFrm` signal. However, if there's a status update from an accepted frame (indicated by `RxStatusWriteLatched_sync2`) and the reception pass mode (`r_PassAll`) is active or when `ReceivedPauseFrm` is active and `r_PassAll` is off, it resets the pause frame status. Additionally, upon receiving a correct length packet with acceptable operation code (ensured by `ByteCntEq16 & TypeLengthOK & OpCodeOK`), it sets `ReceivedPauseFrm` high denoting a successfully received pause frame.\n"
