This block of code controls the Memory Controller Block (MCB) input-output operations. It sets various parameters, including the memory cell address, whether the operation is read or write mode, the write data, and the user interface address. Additionally, it marks the command valid for execution. Depending on whether MCB is ready/available or busy, the state machine transitions to LDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM or LDQS_CLK_N_TERM_WAIT state respectively. The STATE variable is used to orchestrate the operation sequence.
