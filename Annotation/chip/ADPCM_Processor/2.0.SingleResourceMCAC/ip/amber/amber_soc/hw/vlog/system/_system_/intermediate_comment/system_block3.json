    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is specifying parameters and defining signals for two modules: the wishbone to Xilinx Spartan6 DDR3 bridge (wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge) and the DDR3 module (ddr3). The wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge module is used to interface the wishbone bus (WB) to a DDR3 memory accessed through the Xilinx Spartan6 FPGA. It defines the width of the wishbone data and address bus and connects them to the DDR3 memory. The DDR3 memory itself is instantiated and the appropriate signals to communicate with it are declared. These include control signals like command enable, masks, and data signals, among others. Specific components of the Spartan6 FPGA, such as the Memory Controller Block (MCB) are also correctly wired in order to interact with the DDR3 memory."
