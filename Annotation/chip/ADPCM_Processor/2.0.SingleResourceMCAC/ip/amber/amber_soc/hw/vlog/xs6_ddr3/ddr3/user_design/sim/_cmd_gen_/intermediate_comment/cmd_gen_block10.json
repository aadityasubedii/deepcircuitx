    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for error detection and handling. It checks if an invalid instruction mode is being used, specifically, if the instruction mode ('instr_mode_i') exceeds 2 and the hardware family is \"VIRTEX6\". When the specified condition is met, the simulation stops after displaying an error message indicating an invalid instruction mode. This is implemented through the usage of always block, conditional statement and system tasks \"$display\" and \"$stop\"."
