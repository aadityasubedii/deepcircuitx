    "block_comment": "This block assigns the variable `tdqs_n` with an undefined (high impedance state z) bit string of size `DQS_BITS`. The high impedance state is represented by the `1'bz` binary value. This operation is commonly used when the specific bit values do not matter or the subsequent circuitry is designed to handle high impedance states, providing flexibility for handling various data conditions."
