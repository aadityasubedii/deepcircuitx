Comment: 
This block assigns appropriate tag address based on the active source selection signal. If source_sel[C_FILL] is high, it extracts a specific slice from the miss_address (CACHE_ADDR32_MSB to CACHE_ADDR32_LSB). Similar approach is used if source_sel[C_INVA] or source_sel[C_INIT] or source_sel[C_CORE] are high, the tag addresses are set to ex_read_address, init_count, and address, respectively. If none of these conditions match, CACHE_ADDR_WIDTH is multiplexed with '0'.
