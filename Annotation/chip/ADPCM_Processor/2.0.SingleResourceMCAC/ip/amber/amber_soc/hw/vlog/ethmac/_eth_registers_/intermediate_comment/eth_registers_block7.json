    "block_comment": "This block of code implements an interrupt handler for a receive buffer (rxb) in digital communication. On every positive edge of clock or reset signal, it checks for a reset, or a rx buffer interrupt, or a write interrupt, and accordingly sets the irq_rxb flag. If a reset occurs, it clears the irq_rxb flag. Upon receiving the rxb interrupt, it sets the irq_rxb flag after a propagation delay(Tp). If a write interrupt and a specific data input condition are met, it resets the irq_rxb flag accounting for the propagation delay(Tp)."
