The block functions as a synchronous reset and signal delay module. Whenever the system clock WB_CLK_I registers a rising edge or the Reset signal goes high, the block activates. In the case of a Reset, the RxAbortSync2 signal is asynchronously set to zero. If the Reset signal is low during the rising clock edge then the RxAbortSync2 signal takes on the current value of the RxAbortSync1 signal, effectively implementing a single-unit time delay. This mechanism adds temporal distinction between the RxAbortSync2 and RxAbortSync1 signals that could be critical in sequenced or pipelined operations.
