    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThis \"read_data_path\" module performs read operations for memory devices, offering error handling, data reading, and managing read commands. Its adaptability to diverse hardware families and memory burst lengths is noteworthy. The core functionality is implemented using a variety of combinational and sequential logic, including numerous internal signals for command generations, data comparison, and data read tracking. Special handling is implemented for different hardware families (SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6) & burst lengths using if-else condition checks and loops. This module provides a robust method for data read operations with a focus on error management and hardware configurability."
