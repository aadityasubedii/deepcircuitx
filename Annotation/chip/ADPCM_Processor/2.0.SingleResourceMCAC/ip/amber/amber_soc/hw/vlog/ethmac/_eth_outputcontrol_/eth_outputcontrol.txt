Module-level comment: The 'eth_outputcontrol' module controls Ethernet output operations. It uses input signals like WriteOp, NoPre, InProgress, ShiftedBit, BitCounter, and MdcEn_n to control operations and output Mdo and MdoEn signals. Internal signals SerialEn, MdoEn_2d, MdoEn_d, Mdo_2d, Mdo_d establish a pipeline for effective data control. Logic is set based on these signals and managed by clock and reset signals across two 'always' blocks. Upon each clock cycle, signals navigate through the pipeline, delivering the expected output or resetting if needed.
