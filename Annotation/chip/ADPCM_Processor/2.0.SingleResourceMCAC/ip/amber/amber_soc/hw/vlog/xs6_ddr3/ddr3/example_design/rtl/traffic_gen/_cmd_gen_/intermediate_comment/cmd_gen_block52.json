    "block_comment": "The block of code enables the `cmd_clk` signal. It does so by performing a bitwise AND operation on input signals - `rdy_i`, `pipe_out_vld`, `run_traffic_i`, and checks if the mode is a \"load pulse\" and the `CMD_PATTERN` equals \"CGEN_BRAM\". If these conditions are met, the `cmd_clk_en` signal is assigned true, else it remains false. Thus, the signal `cmd_clk` would be effectively enabled when the interface is ready (`rdy_i`), there's valid pipe output (`pipe_out_vld`), traffic run command is asserted (`run_traffic_i`) while being in a specific mode (\"CGEN_BRAM\")."
