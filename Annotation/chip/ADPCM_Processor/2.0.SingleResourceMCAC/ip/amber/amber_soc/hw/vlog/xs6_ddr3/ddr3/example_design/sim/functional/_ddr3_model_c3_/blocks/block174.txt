This block of code is a timing check module for a clock enable signal. It constantly monitors the 'cke_in' signal and reports timing violations, including Input High Time (tIH) and Input Pulse Width (tIPW). When 'cke_in' changes, if the reset condition 'rst_n_in' is met, the block checks whether the current time has surpassed the required time intervals (TIH and TIPW). Using the $display statement, it generates an error message if there is a timing violation, highlighting the difference between the actual and expected time. At the end, the present time is preserved in 'tm_cke' for subsequent checks.
