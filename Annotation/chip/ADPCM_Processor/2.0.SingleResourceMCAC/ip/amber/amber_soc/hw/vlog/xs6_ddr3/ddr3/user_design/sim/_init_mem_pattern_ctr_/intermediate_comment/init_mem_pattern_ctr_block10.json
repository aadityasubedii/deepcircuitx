    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code block is a flip-flop circuit, designed to synchronously update two registers upon detecting a positive edge of the input clock signal. It achieves this by assigning the value of an input (mcb_init_done_i) to a register (mcb_init_done_reg1) and transferring this register's value to another register (mcb_init_done_reg) during the positive clock cycle. This effectively provides a two-stage delay to the propogation of the initiation signal."
