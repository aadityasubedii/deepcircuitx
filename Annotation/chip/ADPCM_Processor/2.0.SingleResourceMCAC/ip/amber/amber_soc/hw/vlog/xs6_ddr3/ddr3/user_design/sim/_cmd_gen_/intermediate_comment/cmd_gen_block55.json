    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog RTL code describes setup logic for a load signal named 'first_load_pulse'. Upon a positive edge clock signal, if the first bit of the 'rst_i' signal is high, the 'first_load_pulse' signal is set to high after a time delay 'TCQ'. On the contrary, if the 'mode_load_pulse' signal is high, 'first_load_pulse' is reset to low after the same delay. If neither conditions are met, 'first_load_pulse' maintains its present state, allowing the circuit to perform other operations while retaining the state of this signal.\n"
