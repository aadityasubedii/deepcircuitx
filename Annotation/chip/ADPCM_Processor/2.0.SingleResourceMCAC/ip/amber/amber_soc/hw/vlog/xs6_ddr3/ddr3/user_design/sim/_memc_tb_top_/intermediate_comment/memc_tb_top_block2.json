    "block_comment": "This block manages command field mappings for Port 4 (P4), addressing read/write modes. If Port 4 is enabled and in read mode, it utilizes command data from the first enabled port found in a sequential check (Port 0 to Port 5), prioritizing lower numbered ports. If other ports are disabled or in write-mode, P4 uses its own command field data. In write mode, P4 directly uses its command data, skip checking other ports."
