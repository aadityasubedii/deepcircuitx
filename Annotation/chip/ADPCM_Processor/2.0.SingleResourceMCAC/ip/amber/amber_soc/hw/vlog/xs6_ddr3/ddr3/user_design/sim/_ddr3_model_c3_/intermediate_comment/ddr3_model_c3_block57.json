    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for performing a positive edge timing check using the \"dqs_in\" signal. The timing check is initiated every time there's a positive edge detected on the 9th bit of the \"dqs_in\" array. The method \"dqs_pos_timing_check\" is then called with the parameter 8, to carry out the timing check on the specified bit."
