    "block_comment": "This block runs a function named `dqs_even_receiver` which takes `3` as an argument on every positive edge of the `dqs_even[3]` signal. It essentially samples the input signal `dqs_even[3]` and triggers an action whenever a transition from low to high voltage level is detected. The use of `always @(posedge dqs_even[3])` indicates that the function `dqs_even_receiver` is synchronous to the digital signal `dqs_even[3]` and is activated on the rising edge of the signal. Enter the original code block to comprehend the wider context."
