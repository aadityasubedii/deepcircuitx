Comment: 
This block of code manages the updating process of the `STATE` value in the application based on the `Block_Reset` signal. When `Block_Reset` is asserted, `STATE` is assigned a value `RST_DELAY` to perform a reset operation, indicating the system is in the reset state. Meanwhile, in the absence of a reset signal, i.e., if `Block_Reset` is off, `STATE` is assigned a value `START_DYN_CAL_PRE`, marking the onset of a dynamic calibration period.
