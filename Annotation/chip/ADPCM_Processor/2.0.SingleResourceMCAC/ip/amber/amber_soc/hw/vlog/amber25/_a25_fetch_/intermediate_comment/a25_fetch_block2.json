    "block_comment": "This block of code performs the task of a memory interface request on a positive clock edge. It makes use of a flip-flop design to achieve this, which means it updates the `wb_req_r` signal when the clock signal `i_clk` rises. In doing so, it uses a logical AND operation between the output signal `o_wb_req` and the negation of input signal `i_wb_ready`, ensuring the request is sent only when no previous request is pending."
