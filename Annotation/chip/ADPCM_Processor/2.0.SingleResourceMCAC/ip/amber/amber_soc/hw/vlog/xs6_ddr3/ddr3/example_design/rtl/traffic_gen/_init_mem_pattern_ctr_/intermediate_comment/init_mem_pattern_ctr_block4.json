    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily manages the state of the 'fix_bl_value'. Upon receipt of the positive edge clock signal, it checks for the condition of a reset signal (rst_i) or an equality condition (FAMILY equal to \"VIRTEX6\"), and assigns a fixed value to 'fix_bl_value' if either is satisfied. However, if the 'vio_modify_enable' signal is high (1'b1), it replaces the 'fix_bl_value' with 'vio_fixed_bl_value'. Thus, the block allows dynamic control over 'fix_bl_value' according to specific conditions."
