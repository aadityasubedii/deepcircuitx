    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a phase selection for a dynamic reconfiguration port (DRP). It alters the `AddressPhase` signal based on specific conditions related to the `state` and `bit_cnt` signals. On every rising clock edge (`DRP_CLK`), this block checks if system reset (`sync_rst`) is active. If so, `AddressPhase` is set to `0`. If not, `AddressPhase` is either maintained or changed based on the `state` and `bit_cnt` signals. If `AddressPhase` is `1` and the system `state` is not `ALMOST_READY2`, `AddressPhase` is retained as `1`. Otherwise, if the system is in the `ADDR_PHASE` state and `bit_cnt` is 7 (`'b111`), `AddressPhase` is set to `1`. This ensures a proper address phase sequencing of the DRP and facilitates precise control over the reconfiguration cycles."
