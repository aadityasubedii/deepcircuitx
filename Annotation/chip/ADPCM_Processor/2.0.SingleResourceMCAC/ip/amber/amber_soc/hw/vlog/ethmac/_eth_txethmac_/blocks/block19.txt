Comment: 
The block regulates the collision window 'ColWindow' in an Ethernet transmission system. The 'ColWindow' flag is set or reset on a positive edge of the transmit clock 'MTxClk' or system reset 'Reset.' If the system is reset, 'ColWindow' is instantly set otherwise, based on different conditions, it turns off or on. It is shut off if there are no collisions, the byte count equals the collision counter, and if any of the StateData[1], StateFCS followed by a NibCnt[0], or StatePAD together with a NibCnt[0] are true. On the contrary, if the system state is idle 'StateIdle' or in between frames 'StateIPG', the collision window is enabled.
