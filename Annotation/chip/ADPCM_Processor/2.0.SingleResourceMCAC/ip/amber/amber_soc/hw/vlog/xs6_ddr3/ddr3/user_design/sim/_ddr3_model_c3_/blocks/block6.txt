Comment: 
This block of code is executing a timing check for data strobe signals using the `dqs_neg_timing_check` function each time there's a positive edge in the 27th strobe signal (`dqs_in[26]`). This is done applying the `always` keyword at positive edge (`posedge`) of the 27th data strobe signal (`dqs_in[26]`), which triggers the `dqs_neg_timing_check` function, passing '26' as an argument, to maintain synchronization between data and strobe signals.
