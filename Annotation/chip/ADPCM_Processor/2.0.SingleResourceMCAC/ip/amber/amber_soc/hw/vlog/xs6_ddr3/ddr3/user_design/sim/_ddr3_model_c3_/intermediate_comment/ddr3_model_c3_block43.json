    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a function check at the falling edge signal of the digital quarantine system (DQS) at index 22. It does this by constantly monitoring (with 'always') the signal at this index for a negative edge transition, and when it detects such a transition, it calls the `dqs_pos_timing_check(22)` function, which presumably checks the positive timing of the DQS at index 22."
