This block of code updates the read pointer of a memory buffer or synchronizer. Specifically, it operates at the rising edge of the write clock ('wr_clk'). First, the current read pointer value is passed through a function 'gray8' to convert it into gray code format, capturing the result in 'rd_pointer_d1'. This is done to prevent misreads during simultaneous changes of multiple bits in binary code. By storing the gray code read pointer, potential errors can be minimized during read/write operations. The 'rd_pointer_d1' is consecutively assigned to 'rd_pointer_d2' for use in the next clock cycle.
