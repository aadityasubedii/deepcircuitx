    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the value to the 'wr_en' signal. It functions as a write enable control, which is determined by a logical AND operation of four signals - 'cmd_valid_i', negated 'full', 'dfifo_has_enough_room_d1', and 'wait_done'. The 'wr_en' signal enables writing if a new command is valid, the command queue is not full, there is ample space in the data FIFO, and the wait time has elapsed."
