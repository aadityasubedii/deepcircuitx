Module name: eth_rxethmac.

Module specification: The eth_rxethmac module represents the receiving section of an Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) interface. Its main purpose is to receive and process Ethernet frames according to the Ethernet standards, handling states of the receiving process, and allowing control over the reception behavior.

The module takes a variety of input ports including the receiving clock signal (MRxClk), data valid signal (MRxDV), received data (MRxD), different control signals such as the transmitting state (Transmitting) and the reception of jumbo frames (HugEn). It also receives adjustment signals like the cyclic redundancy check delay enable signal (DlyCrcEn). Other significant inputs include maximum frame length (MaxFL), interframe gap indicator (r_IFG), the reset signal (Reset), the 48-bit MAC address, promiscuous and broadcast reception indicators, hashed MAC addresses, and control signals for accepting all incoming frames and specifically addressed control frames.

The module outputs include the received data (RxData), data validity (RxValid), start and end of received frame indicator signals (RxStartFrm, RxEndFrm), the byte count of received data (ByteCnt), and status flags like the CRC error, different states of the reception process, the abort reception signal and the destination address mismatched signal.

In addition, the module uses an array of internal signals such as data delay (DelayData), latched byte (LatchedByte), broadcast and multicast indicators, signals to generate respective Rx signals, CRC-related signals, and several signals for checking and controlling byte count and other conditions. These internal signals assist in managing data reception, frame processing, ensuring data integrity, and handling special frame conditions.

The module includes several internal blocks, notably a state machine (rxstatem1), counters (rxcounters1), address checks (rxaddrcheck1), and CRC computations (crcrx). With these, the module can efficiently store, direct and manipulate the incoming data, control states of data reception, calculate and check CRC, check hashed addresses and handle conditions based on state and byte count. This makes the eth_rxethmac module a robust and comprehensive entity for managing the reception and processing of Ethernet frames in a network system.
