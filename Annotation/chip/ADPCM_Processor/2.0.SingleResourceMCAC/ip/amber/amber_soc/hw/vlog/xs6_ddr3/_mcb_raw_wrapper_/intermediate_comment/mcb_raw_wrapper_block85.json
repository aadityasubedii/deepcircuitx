    "block_comment": "This block of code is a conditional logic loop associated with the positive edge of the `ui_clk` signal. The logic inside the block checks if both `selfrefresh_enter` and `selfrefresh_mode` signals are not present (denoted by the `~` sign), if so, the `syn_uiclk_pll_lock` signal is assigned the value of `pll_lock` signal. This part of the code essentially synchronizes the `ui_clk` signal with the `pll_lock` signal if the system is not in self-refresh mode."
