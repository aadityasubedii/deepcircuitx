    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for handling data writing as well as byte control in a data bus system. Specifically, the `write_data` signal is assigned the value of `i_wb_dat` to handle write operations in the system. The `byte_enable` signal is assigned the value of `i_wb_sel` to manage byte selection activities. Lastly, the output data on the data bus (`o_wb_dat`) is assigned the `read_data`, facilitating read operations in the system."
