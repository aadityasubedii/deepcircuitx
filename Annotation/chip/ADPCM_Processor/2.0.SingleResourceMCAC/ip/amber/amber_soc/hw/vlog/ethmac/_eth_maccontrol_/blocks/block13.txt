Comment: 
This block resets or updates two transmission-related signals (TxAbortInLatched, TxDoneInLatched) based on the system status. On the rising edge of the TxReset signal, it initiates a reset sequence, setting both TxAbortInLatched and TxDoneInLatched to 0 after a propagation delay (Tp). When the TxReset signal is low, the block latches the current values of TxAbortIn and TxDoneIn into TxAbortInLatched and TxDoneInLatched respectively, with the time delay of Tp.
