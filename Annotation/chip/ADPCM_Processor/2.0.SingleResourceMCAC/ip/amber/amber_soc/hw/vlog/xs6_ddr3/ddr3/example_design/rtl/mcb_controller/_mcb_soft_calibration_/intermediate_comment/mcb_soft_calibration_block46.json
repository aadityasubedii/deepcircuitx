    "block_comment": "This block, labeled as 'SKEW', performs a series of mathematical operations on various variables representing the positive and negative terms through a function called 'Mult_Divide'. The Mult_Divide function takes three arguments (a term, a multiplier, and a divisor), and likely executes a multiplication and division operation, adjusting the inputted term. It addresses different positive ('P_Term') and negative ('N_Term') terms and applies specific multipliers ('MULT_S', 'MULT_W') and divisors ('DIV_S', 'DIV_W'). Notably, the program subtracts '1' from any negative term before passing it to Mult_Divide. Finally, the program sets the 'STATE' as 'WAIT_FOR_START_BROADCAST', which may indicate a wait for the next operational state."
