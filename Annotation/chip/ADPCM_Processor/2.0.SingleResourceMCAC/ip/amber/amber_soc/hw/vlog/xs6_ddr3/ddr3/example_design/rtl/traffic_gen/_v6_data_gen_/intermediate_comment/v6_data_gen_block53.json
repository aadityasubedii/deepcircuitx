    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is designed to perform data generation with conditions based on specific inputs. The function is triggered by a positive edge clock (clk_i), alongside with predefined conditions like fifo_rdy_i or cmd_startC. Depending on the address input (addr_i[6:4]) and data mode (data_mode_i), it selects a data generation process using a case statement, then assigns the generated data to w1data. It also supports switchable data generation methods (Data_Gen and Data_GenW0). If another condition (MEM_BURST_LEN == 8) is met, it rearranges and assigns new values to w1data based on the present data bit indices, using concatenation and slicing techniques, manipulating 4 groups of data each with size equal to the number of data query pins (NUM_DQ_PINS)."
