This block of code performs a synchronous reset on rising edge of the clock. The reset function is achieved by assigning the 'rst_i' input to the 'rst_ra' and 'rst_rb' arrays on the rising edge of 'clk_i' after a clock quarter delay denoted by '#TCQ'. This ensures a reset on the sequential elements is triggered synchronously with the system clock.
