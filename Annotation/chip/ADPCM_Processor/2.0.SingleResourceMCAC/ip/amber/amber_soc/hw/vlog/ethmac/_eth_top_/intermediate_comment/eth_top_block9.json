    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic implementation that is synchronous with a clock signal (wb_clk_i) or a reset signal (wb_rst_i). The primary purpose of this implementation is to control the state of a control frame system (WillSendControlFrame_sync2) based on signal inputs. The block captures the rising edge of these signals to either reset the control frame system (set it to 0) when the reset signal is high, or to delay updating the state of the control frame system by a propagation delay (#Tp) based on the state of another control frame system (WillSendControlFrame_sync1) in any other case."
