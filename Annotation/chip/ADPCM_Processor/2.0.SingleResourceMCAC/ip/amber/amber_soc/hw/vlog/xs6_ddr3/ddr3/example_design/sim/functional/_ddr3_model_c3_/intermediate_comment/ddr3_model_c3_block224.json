    "block_comment": "The function 'open_bank_file' is responsible for opening a writable file for a specific bank. It constructs a file name by formatting a string with the temporary model directory path and the bank number. After the filename is created, it attempts to open the file for write and read access. If the attempt to open the file is unsuccessful, an error message is displayed and the simulation ends. If the file opens successfully and the debug mode is on, an information message is displayed. The file discriptor is then returned as the output of the function."
