    "block_comment": "This Verilog function calculates the number of time slots based on input port configuration and enabled status. It accomplishes this by looping through the port_enable array and incrementing a counter each time it encounters an enabled port (it checks for '1'). The function finally returns 10 if the port configuration is 1 and five ports are enabled, else it returns 12."
