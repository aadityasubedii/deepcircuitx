    "block_comment": "This block of code performs the function of a DQS (Data Strobe) signal receiver. This operation is triggered at the rising edge of the first DQS bit in the 'dqs_odd' array. This functionality is implemented through the procedural 'always' block which is called whenever there is a positive-edge change in 'dqs_odd[0]'. The procedure 'dqs_odd_receiver' is then invoked with 0 as an argument. This efficiently handles changes in DQS signal state."
