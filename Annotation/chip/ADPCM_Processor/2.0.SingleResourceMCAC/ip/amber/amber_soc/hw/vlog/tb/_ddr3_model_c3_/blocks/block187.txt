This block of code implements a triggered operation upon the positive edge detection in the 'dqs_odd' bi-directional data bus line at index '4'. Using the 'always' keyword, the hardware module 'dqs_odd_receiver' is instantiated every time a positive edge (rise from low to high voltage) is detected in the 'dqs_odd' bus line at index '4', essentially achieving synchronous operation with respect to that specific bus line signal.
