Comment: 
This block defines a synchronous reset mechanism for the four least significant bits of the MTxD register. On the rising edge of either the MTxClk or the Reset, the block checks if a Reset has occurred. If a reset signal has been detected, the block immediately clears the lower four bits of the MTxD register to zero with a propagation delay defined by Tp. Otherwise, it retains the current value of the lower four bits of the MTxD_d register, also with a delay of Tp.
