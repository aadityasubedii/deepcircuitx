    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is a data conditioning module used for dealing with varying width data buses. It handles two cases of Write-back (WB) data width- 128 and others (denoted as 32 here). If the WB_DWIDTH is 128, the block uses an input address `i_wb_adr` to selectively pull out 32 bit sections from the 128 bit data `i_wb_dat`, based on the lower two bits of the address. If the WB_DWIDTH is not 128, it directly assigns the input data `i_wb_dat` to the 32 bit write data `wb_wdata32`. In both cases, it uploads the output WB data bus `o_wb_dat` with the processed data."
