    "block_comment": "The block of code manages a control signal 'u_bcount_2'. This signal upturns when there is a positive edge on the input clock, if the user burst count equals 2 and the FIFO is not full, or if the command to start 'C' is active with 'bl_i' value as 1. The signal 'u_bcount_2' is reset when the output 'last_word_o' is active. The pseudo blocking assignments with delay '#TCQ' mean that these operations are handled asynchronously."
