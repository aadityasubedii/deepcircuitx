Comment: 
This Verilog block is responsible for controlling the transmit complete interrupt request signal in response to transmission clock or system reset signals. If a system reset is detected, it immediately clears the interrupt request signal by assigning it a value of 0. If a transmission has reached its end and is confirmed to be done and the transmission flow control signal is active, it sets the interrupt request signal by assigning it a value of 1, indicating that a transmission operation has completed successfully. On the other hand, if a synchronised reset of the interrupt signal is detected, it also clears the interrupt request signal by setting it to 0.
