Comment: 
This block of code manages the readiness status of commands (`cmd_rdy`) within a system, reacting to different system signals. Taking edge-change updates from the clock signal (`clk_i`), the readiness of commands is determined based on the system's reset signal (`rst_i[0]`), the command start signal (`cmd_start`), and the conditions of the data port FIFO and user burst count (`data_port_fifo_rdy && user_burst_cnt == 1`). When the reset is active, or the data port FIFO is ready and user burst count equals to 1, `cmd_rdy` is set to 1 (ready). If the command start signal is active, then `cmd_rdy` is set to 0 (not ready). Delays indicated by `#TCQ` are employed in the updates.
