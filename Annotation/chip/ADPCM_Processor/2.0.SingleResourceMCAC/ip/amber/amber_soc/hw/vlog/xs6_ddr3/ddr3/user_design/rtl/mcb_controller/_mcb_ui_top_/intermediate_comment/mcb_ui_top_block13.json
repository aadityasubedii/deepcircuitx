    "block_comment": "This code block serves as a conditional configuration setup for Verilog modules based on the status of the 'C_S2_AXI_ENABLE' check. If 'C_S2_AXI_ENABLE' is zero, the block directly assigns corresponding input signals with the same output signals. However, if it's not zero, the block performs operations related to AXI-MCB Interface module, mapping AXI Address bus with MCB User Interface, and maintaining synchronization with 'mcb_ui_top_synch'. It also embeds the 'axi_mcb' module with certain parameters such as ID, Address width, Data width etc., and connects it with the given inputs/outputs. Subsequently, those inputs/outputs are sync with the external AXI signals providing a bridge between the AXI Bus and Memory Controller Block(MCB)."
