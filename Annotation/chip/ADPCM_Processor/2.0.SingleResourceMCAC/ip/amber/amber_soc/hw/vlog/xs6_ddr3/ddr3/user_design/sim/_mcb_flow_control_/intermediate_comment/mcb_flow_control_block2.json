    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code adds the logic for state transition in a finite state machine (FSM). After every rising edge of the input clock (clk_i), if the least significant bit of the reset signal (rst_i) is high, the code resets the current state to a specified value (4'b0001), effectively resetting the FSM state. If the reset signal isn't high, the FSM transitions to whatever is the next determined state, assigned to the variable next_state. The transitions use a delay defined by the constant TCQ, presumably for setup/hold time compliance."
