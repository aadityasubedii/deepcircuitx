    "block_comment": "The main purpose of this Verilog code block is to handle hardware configurations if no terminal calibration is needed (`C_CALIB_SOFT_IP != \"TRUE\"`). It collectively assigns various signals to the corresponding memory controller block (`mcb_` prefixed signals). These signals control various aspects of the memory operation such as read, add, clock, etc. It resets the system ('MCB_SYSRST') using internal system reset signal or when a counter reaches a specific value. Further, the code block sets the self-refresh mode to low. It also prepares for initial sequence execution if not in simulation context (`C_SIMULATION == \"FALSE\"`)."
