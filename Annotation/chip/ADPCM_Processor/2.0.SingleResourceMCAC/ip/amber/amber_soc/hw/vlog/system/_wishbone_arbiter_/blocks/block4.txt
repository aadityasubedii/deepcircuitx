This block primarily generates an acknowledgment signal [`master_ack`] to the master, based on the identity of the current slave. The condition checks for the `current_slave` value using a ternary operator. It follows if-else logic. If `current_slave` is 0, `master_ack` is assigned as `i_s0_wb_ack`; If the `current_slave` is 1, `master_ack` is assigned as `i_s1_wb_ack`, and so on. It accommodates up to 8 slaves, from 0 to 7. If none of the conditions are met, `master_ack` is set as `i_s2_wb_ack` by default.
