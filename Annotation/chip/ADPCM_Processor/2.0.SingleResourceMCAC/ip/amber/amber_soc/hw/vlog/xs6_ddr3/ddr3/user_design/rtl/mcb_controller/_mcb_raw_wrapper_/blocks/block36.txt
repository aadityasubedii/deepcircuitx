This block of code performs an initialization function at the start of the verilog simulation. First, it pre-sets the 'wait_200us_counter' with a maximum 16-bit hexadecimal value (FFFF). It then displays a message alerting that the 200 microsecond wait period, typically required before the CKE goes active, has been bypassed in this particular simulation.
