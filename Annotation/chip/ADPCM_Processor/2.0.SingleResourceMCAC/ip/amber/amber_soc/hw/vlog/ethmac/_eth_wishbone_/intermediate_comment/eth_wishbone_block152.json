    "block_comment": "This block of code controls a transmission enable signal 'TxEn_needed' in response to certain conditions. The function is activated at the positive edge of either the wb_clk_i signal or the reset signal. Upon reset, the block sets 'TxEn_needed' to 0. If the reset is not active, the code checks for the absence of 'TxBDReady', the presence of 'r_TxEn' and 'WbEn', and the negation of 'WbEn_q', and if all these conditions are met, 'TxEn_needed' is set to 1. If these conditions are not met, it checks if 'TxPointerRead', 'TxEn', and 'TxEn_q' are all high, if they are, 'TxEn_needed' is reset to 0."
