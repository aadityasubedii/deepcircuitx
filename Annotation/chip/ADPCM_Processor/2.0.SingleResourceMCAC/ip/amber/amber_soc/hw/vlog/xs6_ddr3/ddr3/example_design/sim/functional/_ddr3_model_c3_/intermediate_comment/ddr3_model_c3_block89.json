    "block_comment": "The block triggers a timing check on a specific slice of a larger bit-vector every time there\u2019s a change in the input value. The always block is set up with sensitivity to any changes in the 42nd bit (since Verilog indices start at 0) of the dq_in input signal and invokes the dq_timing_check function with the bit index as an argument whenever this bit changes in value."
