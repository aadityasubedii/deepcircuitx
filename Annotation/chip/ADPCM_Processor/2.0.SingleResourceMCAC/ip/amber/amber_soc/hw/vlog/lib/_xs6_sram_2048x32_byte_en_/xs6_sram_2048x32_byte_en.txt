Module-level comment: This module implements a 2048x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using four Xilinx RAMB16BWER primitives for Spartan-6 FPGAs. It supports read and write operations with clock, write enable, byte enable, address, and data inputs. The design uses a "READ_FIRST" write mode and allows for memory initialization through parameters. Each RAMB16BWER handles one byte of the 32-bit data width, enabling byte-level write operations.
