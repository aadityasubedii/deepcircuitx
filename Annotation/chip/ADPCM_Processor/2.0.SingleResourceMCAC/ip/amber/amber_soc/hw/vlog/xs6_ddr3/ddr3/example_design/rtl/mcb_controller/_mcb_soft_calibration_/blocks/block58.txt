This block of code is an 'else' branch in a control block that dictates the state of various system operations when no other conditions in the control flow are met. The block chiefly disables a host of operations by assigning them "off" or zero (1'b0) values. Specifically, it turns off the counter, invalidates the IODRPCTRLR command, sets the memory cell address to NoOp, sets the IODRPCTRLR to READ_MODE, and deactivates the back store usage. Moreover, it invalidates the MCB command and turns off MCB UILDQSINC, MCB UIUDQSINC, and MCB UILDQSDEC functionalities. This block essentially acts as a reset or idle state in the control schema, ensuring no unwanted operations are active when the system isn't performing any specific tasks.
