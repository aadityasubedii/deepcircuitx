This block of code generates a delay of 200 microseconds. It uses a flip-flop that operates at the positive edge of the interface clock ('ui_clk') to implement the delay. If the 14th and 13th bits of the 'wait_200us_counter' are high, the 'wait_200us_done_r1' is set to high indicating that 200 microsecond delay has been reached, otherwise, it's reset. The status of the 'wait_200us_done_r1' is then transferred to 'wait_200us_done_r2' in the next clock cycle.
