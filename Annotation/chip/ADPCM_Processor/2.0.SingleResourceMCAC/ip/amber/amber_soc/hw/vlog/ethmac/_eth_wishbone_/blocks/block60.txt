Comment: 
The block assigns the status of the receiver module. If the receiver module is enabled (`RxEn` and `RxEn_q` are true), and the data is ready to be read from the buffer descriptor (`RxBDRead` is true), the status of the receiver module (`RxStatus_s`) will be assigned the two bits (14:13) from the read data (`ram_do`). Otherwise, `RxStatus_s` retains its current status (`RxStatus`).
