Comment: 
The block assigns interrupt request flags based on different conditions. `firq_request` is set when there's a fast interrupt request (`firq`) and the 27th bit of `i_execute_status_bits` is not set. Similarly, `irq_request` is set when there's an interrupt request (`irq`) and the 28th bit of `i_execute_status_bits` is not set. `swi_request` is set when the interrupt type (`itype`) equals to the software interrupt (`SWI`). Lastly, `dabt_request` merely reflects the `dabt_reg` status.
