Module name: ddr3. Module specification: The ddr3 module is a DDR3 memory controller interface designed to handle DDR3 SDRAM operations. It instantiates infrastructure and memory controller wrapper submodules, providing multiple command, write, and read ports (p0-p5) for interfacing with DDR3 memory. The module includes input ports for system clock (c3_sys_clk), reset (c3_sys_rst_i), and various command, write, and read signals for each port. Output ports include DDR3 interface signals (e.g., mcb3_dram_a, mcb3_dram_ba), calibration status (c3_calib_done), and status signals for each port. Internal signals manage clock generation, reset control, and PLL operations. The module is parameterized to allow configuration of various aspects such as clock periods, memory
