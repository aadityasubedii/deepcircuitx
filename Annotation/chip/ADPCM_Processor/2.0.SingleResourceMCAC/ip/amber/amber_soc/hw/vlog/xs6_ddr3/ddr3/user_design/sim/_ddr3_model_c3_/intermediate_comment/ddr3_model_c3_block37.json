    "block_comment": "The block of code initiates a negative edge triggered event. Specifically, this event occurs whenever a negative transition is detected in the 28th bit of the dqs_in signal array. Upon detection of this event, the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function with 28 as an argument is called. This function is typically used to verify the timing of the DQS positive edge."
