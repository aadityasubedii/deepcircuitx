Module-level comment: The 'tg_status' module serves as a debugging tool in a larger system, detecting and reporting data errors. It employs two always blocks, ensuring data error value is delayed by a clock cycle and managing error status initialization, setting, and preservation. Upon error detection, debug information, such as comparison data, read data, address, burst length, and memory controller buffer status, is latched into 'error_status'. This status is cleared by reset or manual_clear_error signals. The module uses two internal signals: 'data_error_r' to maintain error's stability over a clock cycle and 'error_set' to indicate an error occurrence.
