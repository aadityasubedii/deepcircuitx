This block of code handles the case when the system is idle. At the rising edge of each clock cycle, if the current state is idle (`c_state == CS_IDLE`), it updates 'valid_bits_r' with the top bit of each 'tag_rdata_way' segment. This operation is done by packing the most significant bits of each 'tag_rdata_way', from 'tag_rdata_way[7]' to 'tag_rdata_way[0]', into a single 8-bit vector, which is then assigned to 'valid_bits_r'.
