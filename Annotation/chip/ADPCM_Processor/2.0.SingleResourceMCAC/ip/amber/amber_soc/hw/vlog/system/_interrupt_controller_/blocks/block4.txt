Comment: 
This block of code performs interrupt handling for two sources of interrupts, irq0 and irq1. The interrupts can be either normal (IRQ) or fast (FIRQ), with the block controlling which interrupts are enabled. The raw interrupt signals are masked with enable registers to isolate the active interrupts. A soft interrupt can be also generated for irq0 and irq1 by setting the softint_0 or softint_1 registers. The final OR operation on irq_0 and irq_1 as well as firq_0 and firq_1 summarizes the total interrupt conditions at each level. If any interrupt source is active in a group, the respective output, o_irq or o_firq, will assert true.
