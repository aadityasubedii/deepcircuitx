Comment: 
This block of code updates the status of the `valid_bits_r` register based on the most significant bits of the `tag_rdata_way` array. The update operation takes place at the positive edge of `i_clk` if the current state is idle (as defined by `c_state == CS_IDLE`). The resulting `valid_bits_r` will contain the most significant bits from `tag_rdata_way` for each way, indicating whether the corresponding cache line is valid or not.
