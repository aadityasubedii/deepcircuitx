    "block_comment": "The cmd_addr_timing_check task serves as a timing check for command and address signals in a digital system, with adjustments for the input variable 'i'. It accomplishes this by monitoring the current system time against established timing parameters TIH and TIPW. Key activities include checking for a tIH timing violation on the initial clock edge if the reset signal has been activated, and a tIH violation if the chip select is not activated. Also, a TIPW violation check is performed to ensure a minimum pulse width of the command/address signals. Each violation triggers a display output indicating the error, the timestamp, the offending command/address signal, and the excess amount of the violation. The system time is also updated for each input 'i' at the end of each check.\n"
