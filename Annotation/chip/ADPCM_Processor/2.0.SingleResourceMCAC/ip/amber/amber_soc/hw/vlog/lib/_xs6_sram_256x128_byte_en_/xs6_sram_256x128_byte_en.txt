Module-level comment: This module, named xs6_sram_256x128_byte_en, implements a 256x128 byte-addressable SRAM with a 128-bit data width. It uses four internal dual-port RAM blocks for simultaneous read and write operations. Inputs control data, write operations, the memory address, and byte-level writes, while an output returns read data. A bitwise AND of expanded write enable and byte enable signals generates an internal signal for byte-specific writing. The module uses a generation block to instantiate the RAM blocks and checks set parameters on initialization.
