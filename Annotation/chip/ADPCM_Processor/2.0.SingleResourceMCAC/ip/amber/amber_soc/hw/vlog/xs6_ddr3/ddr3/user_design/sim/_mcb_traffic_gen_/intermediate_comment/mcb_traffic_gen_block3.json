    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog defines a configurable data write path for a memory system (Function of the block). It includes a generate-if statement that is instantiated upon specified write or bidirectional modes signifying its purpose as a critical part of memory write operations. Parameter ports within the write_data_path module are assigned values with further signals connected for clock, reset, command ready and valid, address, data and mask generation. It also interacts with some off-chip components using output signals such as mcb_wr_en which controls data validation in the memory controller block (Implementation details of the block)."
