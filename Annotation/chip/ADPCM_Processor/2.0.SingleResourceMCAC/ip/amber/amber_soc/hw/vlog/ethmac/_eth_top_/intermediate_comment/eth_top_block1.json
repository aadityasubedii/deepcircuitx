    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code assigns a concatenation of the variable 'm_wb_adr_tmp' and a 2-bit 0 as its least significant bits to the output net 'm_wb_adr_o'. This operation effectively fills in the last two bits of m_wb_adr_o with zeros. The nomenclature implies 'm_wb_adr_o' might be a write-back address used in a processor pipeline."
