    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code defines two modules; `axi_mcb_synch` and `axi_mcb`. The `axi_mcb_synch` provides a synchronization mechanism for the calibration done signal with a single clock input and asynchronous signal input as its input and synchronous signal output as output. The `axi_mcb` is a major block bridging the AXI interface and Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface. It regulates read and write operations, handles the addressing, commands, and data flow between components that support AXI protocol and the MCB. Various parameters, such as family, AXI ID Width, Data Width, Address Width, supports for read and write, strict coherency, and address pointer enable, are configurable. Signals for Address Write, Write, Address Read, and Read are defined for the AXI side. Similarly, signals for Command, Write, and Read are defined for the MCB side. These signals and parameters ensure flexible connectivity between different components."
