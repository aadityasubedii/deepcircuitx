    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code maps control and data signals based on port modes and enable signals for a memory controller interface. If port 3 is enabled and configured for read mode, it checks which other ports are enabled and if they are set for write mode, then maps the control and data signals from the enabled write port to port 3. When port 3 is in write mode, its own control and data signals are directly mapped. The implementation uses a series of if-else statements and 'assign' statements to perform the signal mapping."
