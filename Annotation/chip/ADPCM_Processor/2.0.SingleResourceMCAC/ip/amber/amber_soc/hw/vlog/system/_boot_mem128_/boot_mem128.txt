Module-level comment: 

The 'boot_mem128' Verilog module manages bootstrap memory operations (read/write) for devices using the Wishbone protocol. Input ports accept data/address, write enable, and control signals while output ports yield read data, operation acknowledgement, and error signals. Internal bit-wise operations, separate memory access modules (specific to the FPGA type), and condition-based blocks enable dynamic functioning. Debug mode introduces jitter and maintains read operation status for a set of clock cycles.
