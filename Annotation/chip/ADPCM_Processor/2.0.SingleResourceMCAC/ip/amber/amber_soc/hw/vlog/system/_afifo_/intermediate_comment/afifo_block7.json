    "block_comment": "This block provides the functionality of a data buffer; it controls how data is written into a buffer array as an asynchronous operation. Upon a positive edge of the write clock (`wr_clk`) and provided that the push signal (`i_push`) is high and the buffer is not full (`!o_full`), it increments the write pointer (`wr_pointer`) by one (`1'd1`), and then writes the input data (`i_data`) to the buffer array at the location specified by the lower two bits of the write pointer (`wr_pointer[1:0]`)."
