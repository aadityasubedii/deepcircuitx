    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'timer_module' utilizes a given clock input (`i_clk`) to operate three timers (timer0, timer1, timer2) in a system with a Wishbone bus architecture. It offers functionality to read, write and control each timer individually. All timers decrement based on control register modifications, also allowing for pre-scaling. The module generates an interrupt when a timer value reaches zero, which can be cleared using Wishbone operations. Debug functionalities provide monitoring of various operations. It implements reg/wire assignments, condition checks within always blocks and case statements to achieve its functionality. The 'timer_module' thus manages timing functions in a Wishbone architecture effectively."
