    "block_comment": "The block represents a task in Verilog programming that writes specific condition codes to a file depending on the condition received. This task is implemented using a 'case' statement, where the value of the 'condition' variable determines which string would be written to 'decompile_file'. Different hexadecimal condition values correspond to different strings, defining various conditions like \"eq\" for equal, \"ne\" for not equal, \"cs\" for carry set, etc. For any value of 'condition' not specified, \"nv\" is written to the file."
