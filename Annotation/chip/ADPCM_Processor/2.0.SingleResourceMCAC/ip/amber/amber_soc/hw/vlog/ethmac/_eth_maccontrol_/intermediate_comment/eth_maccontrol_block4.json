    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code functions as a logical OR gate. It uses the bitwise OR operation to send frames from the PadIn port to the PadOut port when enabled by the SendingCtrlFrm signal. Specifically, this occurs when SendingCtrlFrm is high (logic 1), PadOut will be forced to a logic high regardless of the value of PadIn. When SendingCtrlFrm is low (logic 0), the value of PadIn is passed through to PadOut without alteration."
