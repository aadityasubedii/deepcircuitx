This block of code is responsible for updating the `refresh_timer` variable in every rising edge of a given clock (`clk_i`). The function of this block is controlled by the value of the fifth bit (index 4) of the input signal (`rst_i`): When the bit is set, the `refresh_timer` is reset to 0 with a delay defined by `#TCQ`; when it isn't set, the `refresh_timer` is incremented by 1 with the same `#TCQ` delay.
