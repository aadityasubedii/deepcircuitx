    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a clocked block that handles the write operation of a memory entry based on certain signal values. When a rising edge of 'i_clk' is detected and specific bit signal conditions are met, the code performs a write operation to a specified address with provided data and byte enable (be). It gets the address and the write data from a 32-bit signal and a 4-bit signal respectively. These values are then written into a file named 'decompile_file' in a specified format. Additionally, the write operation can be flagged as 'aborted' based on another 1-bit signal."
