Comment: 
This line of code assigns a binary value to the 9th bit of the 'Random' array. If the count stored in 'RetryCnt' is greater than 8, the 9th bit of 'Random' is assigned the value of the 9th bit of the 'x' array; otherwise, it is assigned a binary value of 0. This is a conditional assignment realized with a ternary operator.
