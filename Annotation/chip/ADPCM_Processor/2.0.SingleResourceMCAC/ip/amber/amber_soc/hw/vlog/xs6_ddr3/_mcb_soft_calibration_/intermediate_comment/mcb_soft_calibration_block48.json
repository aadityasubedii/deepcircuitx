    "block_comment": "This block is part of a Verilog finite-state machine (FSM) that controls the loading of termination resistors values (RZQ) into a memory unit. The block assigns the RZQ value to an active IODRP control line, sets the command validity bit, allocates memory cell for NTermination (NTerm), and inputs termination resistor values into the memory unit. The process checks the busy flag (IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N) to decide the next state. If the memory unit is not busy, the FSM remains in the current state, otherwise it transitions to a wait state."
