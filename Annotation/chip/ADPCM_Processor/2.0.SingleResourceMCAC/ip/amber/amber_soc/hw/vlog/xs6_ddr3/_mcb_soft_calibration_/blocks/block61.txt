This block of code defines the control logic for the start dynamic calibration (START_DYN_CAL) state of a memory controller design. The hardware is updated on the rising edge of the UI_CLK clock signal. When a reset signal (RST) is detected, it resets the dynamic calibration performance value (PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH) and the START_DYN_CAL state (START_DYN_CAL_STATE_R1) to 0. However, if there is no reset, the block captures the state of the variables at the rising edge of the clock cycle. It transitions to the START_DYN_CAL state if the current STATE is START_DYN_CAL. It checks conditions for exiting the SELFREFRESH state and whether the memory controller is not in SELFREFRESH mode to control the PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH performance flag.
