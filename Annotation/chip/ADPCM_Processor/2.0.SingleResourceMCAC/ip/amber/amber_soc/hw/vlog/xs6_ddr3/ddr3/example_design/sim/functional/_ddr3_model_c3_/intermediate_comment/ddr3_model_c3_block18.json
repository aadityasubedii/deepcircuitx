    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a procedural block that is sensitive to the negative edge of signal dqs_in[14]. When a negative edge in dqs_in[14] is detected, the function dqs_neg_timing_check with argument 14 is called, providing a check on timing on that specific negative edge transition."
