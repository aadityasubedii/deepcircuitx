It takes in a 32-bit input to be shifted, a shift amount, a carry-in, an indication if shifting is immediate and a function input. The module uses two instances of a shifter module- 'a25_shifter': one for quick shifting operation and one for full shifting operation. Based on the shift amount and the 'use_quick_r' signal, the module decides whether to stall or to use the output of quick shift or full shift operation."

It drives the sequential part of the module.\n- i_in : This 32-bit input is the value which is to be shifted.\n- i_carry_in : This signal is the carry input signal.\n- i_shift_amount : This 8-bit signal determines the amount by which the input value should be shifted.\n- i_shift_imm_zero : This signal indicates whether the shifting operation is immediate or not.\n- i_function : This 2-bit signal is used to specify the function operation to the \"a25_shifter\" sub-modules.\n\nOutput ports: o_out, o_carry_out, o_stall. \n\nExplanation: \n- o_out : This 32-bit output carries the result of the shift operation. Depending on the shift amount and use_quick_r signal, this output will either hold the quick shift or the full shift results.\n- o_carry_out : This signal passes the carry output back to the rest of the circuit.\n- o_stall : This signal indicates whether the module is in a stalled state or not. It asserts if the shift amount is non-zero (other than lower two bits) and use_quick_r signal is high."
