    "block_comment": "The initialize task in this block prepares for future operations by loading register modes and performing certain commands. It takes four mode register inputs and performs an initialization sequence, comprising of a series of command tasks activated conditionally based on a debug flag. The command tasks carry out specific operations referred to by the second parameter \u2013 'NOP', 'ZQ', and 'LOAD_MODE'. The 'LOAD_MODE' tasks load the provided mode registers (mode_reg0 to mode_reg3) with potential bit manipulation ('h100 OR operation) for mode_reg0 to set a certain bit high. Note 'NOP' indicates no operation and 'bx' represents undefined inputs.\n"
