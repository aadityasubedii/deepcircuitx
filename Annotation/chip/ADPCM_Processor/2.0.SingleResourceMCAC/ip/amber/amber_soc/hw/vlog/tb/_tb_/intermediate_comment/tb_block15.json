    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block functions as a clock generator with frequency of 200MHz. It achieves this by initiating the signal`clk_200MHz` to be logic 0 (off) at the beginning. Then it continuously toggles this signal`clk_200MHz` every 2500 time units, thereby creating a square wave signal which represents a clock cycle. This is how the clock signal manifests in digital circuits."
