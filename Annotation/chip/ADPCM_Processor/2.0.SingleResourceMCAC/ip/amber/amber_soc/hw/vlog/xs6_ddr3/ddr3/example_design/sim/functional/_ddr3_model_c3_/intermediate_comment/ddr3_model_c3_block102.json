    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily calling a timing check function for the 29th signal in dq_in. Specific functionality of this block is contingent on the implementation details of the dq_timing_check function. Every time there is a change in the 29th bit of the dq_in signal, the dq_timing_check function will be triggered for this bit."
