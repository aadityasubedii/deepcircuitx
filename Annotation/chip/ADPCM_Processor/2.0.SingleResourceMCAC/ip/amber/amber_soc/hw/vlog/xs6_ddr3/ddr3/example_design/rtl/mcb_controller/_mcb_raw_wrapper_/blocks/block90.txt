This block carries out conditional logic to define the value of the 'gated_pll_lock' signal based on the operating window state. If the system is in the normal operation window, the 'gated_pll_lock' takes the value of the 'pll_lock' signal. Otherwise, it is assigned the value of the 'syn_uiclk_pll_lock' signal. The block makes use of an always block with wildcard sensitivity list to encompass all permutations of the input signal changes.
