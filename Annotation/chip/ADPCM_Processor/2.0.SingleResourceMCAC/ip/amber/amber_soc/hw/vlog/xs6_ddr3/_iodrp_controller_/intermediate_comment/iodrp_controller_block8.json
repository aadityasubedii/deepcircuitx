    "block_comment": "This synchronous block is designed for shifting data through a register. It operates based on the rising edge of DRP_CLK. When sync_rst signal goes high, it resets the shift-through register to zero. Otherwise, if load_shift_n input is high, it loads the value of data_out_mux into shift_through_reg. If load_shift_n isn\u2019t high, it performs a shift operation on the register, pushing the value of DRP_SDO signal to the most significant bit, while the rest of the bits (from bit 7 to 1) are received from the previous state of the same register."
