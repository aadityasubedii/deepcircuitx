Unfortunately, based on the provided Verilog code, it's impossible to generate a detailed specification for a specific module. This is because the given code does not define a complete Verilog module. The highlighted code consists of Verilog `define directives used to declare constants, but doesn't provide detailed specifics about a Verilog module such as the module's name, its functionality, the inputs and outputs, internal signals or a block level overview of functions.

However, what can be surmised from the provided code is that it is likely used defining specific parameters in an Ethernet system, as indicated by the names of the constants (such as `ETH_TX_FIFO_DEPTH and `ETH_RX_FIFO_DEPTH for defining the depths of transmission and reception FIFOs respectively). These parameters define configurations, memory addresses, and width of registers, and could be used in a larger Verilog module to design an Ethernet subsystem.

It is recommended to provide a complete Verilog module which encapsulates these `define directives for a more detailed analysis and to generate a full and comprehensive module specification.
