    "block_comment": "This line of code signifies a status check of a finite state machine (FSM). The operation it performs is evaluating whether the current state of the machine is `READY` or not. The `assign` keyword in Verilog simply creates a continuous assignment statement, which ensures `rdy_busy_n` will be updated everytime `state` changes. The `(state == READY)` is a condition that checks if `state` holds the value `READY`. If true, `rdy_busy_n` will be set to 1 (logical high), indicating the FSM is not busy and prepared to receive or process new data; otherwise, it's set to 0 (logical low), showing that the FSM is currently busy."
