The function of this code block is to handle the control signal `wb_start_read` in a synchronous manner. It operates on a positive edge of `i_clk`, where `i_clk` serves as the clock signal for the system. When a rising edge on `i_clk` is detected, `wb_start_read` is assigned to `wb_start_read_d1`. The value of `wb_start_read` is therefore recorded one clock cycle later in `wb_start_read_d1`, effectively creating a delay of one clock cycle. This is typically used for synchronization or setup purposes in digital systems and for creating pipeline stages, using D flip-flop behavior.
