    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'a25_wishbone' module serves as an interface to manage multiple wishbone protocol requests from three ports using a clock-driven methodology. It supports read/write operations through input/output ports, validates requests through a buffer, and prioritizes them based on arrival order. The implementation is realized using several internal signals and registers, three instances of 'a25_wishbone_buf' module, and a sequential processing code block, resulting in an efficient wishbone protocol handler."
