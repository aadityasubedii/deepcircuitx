Comment: 
This line of code assigns the value of the `exclusive_access` signal. It gets its value by performing a logical AND operation (`&&`) between the inputs `i_exclusive` and `i_cache_enable`. Thus, `exclusive_access` is set to true only when both `i_exclusive` and `i_cache_enable` signals are true, indicating the condition for exclusive access to a cache is met.
