    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of `c3_calib_done` to `calib_done`. Essentially, whenever `c3_calib_done` changes, `calib_done` will also change to reflect the new state. This is a straightforward code block where a wire, `calib_done`, is driven by `c3_calib_done`, attributing a simple data propagation implementation. It is a practical way of ensuring that the status of calibration completions is continually updated and can be used elsewhere in the code."
