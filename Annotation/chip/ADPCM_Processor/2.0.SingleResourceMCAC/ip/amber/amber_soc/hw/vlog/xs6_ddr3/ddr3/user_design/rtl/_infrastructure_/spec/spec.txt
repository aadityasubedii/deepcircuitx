Module name: infrastructure. 

Module specification: The infrastructure module is a core firmware component designed for handling various clock signals, reset functionality, and generating necessary internal clocks within a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) design flow. It uses several FPGA primitives such as IBUFGDS, IBUFG, PLL_ADV, BUFG, BUFGCE, and BUFPLL_MCB. 

The module manages input ports like sys_clk_p, sys_clk_n, sys_clk, and sys_rst_i, and output ports like clk0, rst0, async_rst, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, and pll_lock. The differential and single-ended clock input options can be configured using the 'sys_clk_p', 'sys_clk_n', and 'sys_clk' inputs respectively. Reset functionality is handled by 'sys_rst_i' input and 'rst0' and 'async_rst' outputs based on the nature of reset (active high or low).

Internal signals are defined, such as RST_SYNC_NUM, CLK_PERIOD_NS, CLK_PERIOD_INT, clk_2x_0, clk_2x_180, clk0_bufg, clk0_bufg_in etc. These signals help set the clock periods, configure the clock signals derived from PLL, manage feedback paths for PLL, handle LOCKED output of the PLL, and synchronize reset signals.

The code is divided into three main blocks. The first block uses a generate statement to conditionally instantiate either a differential (IBUFGDS) or single-ended signal (IBUFG). The second block utilizes a PLL_ADV primitive to multiply and divide the clock signal generating several different clock signals within the device, with the parameters for these actions being set by the module parameters. The third block handles buffering and reset functionality. This module is integral to establishing the operational base of a FPGA-based system by managing the necessary clocking infrastructure and reset functionality.
