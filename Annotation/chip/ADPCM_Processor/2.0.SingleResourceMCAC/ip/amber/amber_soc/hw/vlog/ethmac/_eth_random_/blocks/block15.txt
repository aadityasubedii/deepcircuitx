Comment: 
This Verilog block performs a shift-register operation with synchronous reset functionality. Upon the rising edge of the MTxClk clock signal or the assertion of the Reset signal, the sequence of operations within the block is triggered. If the Reset signal is detected, the 10-bit register 'x' is asynchronously set to zero, with the delay of #Tp time units. If the Reset is not asserted, the register 'x' undergoes a shift operation towards the left, pushing the Feedback on the least-significant bit and, at the same time, the most-significant bit is dropped, implemented with a delay of #Tp time units.
