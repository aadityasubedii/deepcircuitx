    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code mainly handles conditional signal assignments based on system stalls. The block is triggered at the positive edge of input clock 'i_clk'. There are four signals updated in this block. 'uncached_wb_stop_r', 'cached_wb_stop_r', and 'daddress_valid_stop_r' are all conditionally updated based on the system halt signals 'i_fetch_stall' or 'o_mem_stall' as well as their specific corresponding signals. The last signal, 'mem_stall_r', mirrors the state of 'o_mem_stall'. The block uses logical operations, specifically OR and AND, to determine the updates to these signals, allowing for a high degree of flexibility and adaptability to system statuses."
