Comment: 
This block manages the readiness of command signals in a synchronous manner. With each rising edge of the clock signal ('clk_i'), the block updates the state of 'cmd_rdy_o' and 'tst_cmd_rdy_o' after a delay determined by 'TCQ'. This implementation ensures that the readiness of these command signals is controlled in a time-delayed manner relative to the clock.
