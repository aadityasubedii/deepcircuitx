Module name: eth_txethmac

Module specification: The eth_txethmac module implements the Media Access Control (MAC) logic for an Ethernet transmitter, managing various states and conditions during Ethernet frame transmission. It takes a variety of input signals such as MTxClk for clock synchronization, Reset for reinitializing all inputs to their initial values, TxStartFrm and TxEndFrm for indicating the start and end of a frame transmission, along with other control signals for managing various aspects of the transmission process including padding, collision detection, and CRC generation. Also, this module produces output signals indicating transmission errors and other conditions. Additionally, it maintains several internal signals to indicate error conditions such as UnderRun, TooBig, ExcessiveDeferOccured, indicating situations like the transmitter running out of data, the data exceeding the permissible limit, or the deferment process exceeding the allowed time respectively. The logic involves several sections for different processes and conditions during the transmission including the computation and preservation of RetryCnt, assessment of RetryMax based on RetryCnt, Ethernet transmission states managed by a statemachine eth_txstatem, CRC calculation by a CRC generator eth_crc, and random number generation by an RNG module eth_random. Basically, it provides complete control over all critical aspects of the frame transmission in an Ethernet environment, from signal synchronization to error handling, retry attempts, random back-off periods, CRC generation, deferment situations and others. Thus, it functions as an essential part in an Ethernet data transmission system.
