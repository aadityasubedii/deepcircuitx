    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code ensures the 'almost_full' signal is updated with every positive edge of the 'wr_clk'. If a reset signal is issued, 'almost_full' is set to zero. Otherwise, it checks the 'buf_avail' variable, which records the available buffer space, against the FIFO_DEPTH. If the buffer is almost full (either two or three positions left depending on the status of 'wr_en'), 'almost_full' gets set to 1; otherwise it remains 0. This conditional check helps in managing the buffer's threshold to warn when it is nearly full."
