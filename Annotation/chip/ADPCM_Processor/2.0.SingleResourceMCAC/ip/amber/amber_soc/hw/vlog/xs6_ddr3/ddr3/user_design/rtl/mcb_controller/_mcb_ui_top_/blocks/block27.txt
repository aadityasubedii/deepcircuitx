This block of code is a function that generates a bitmask (`rr`) based on port configuration and enabled ports [Function of the block]. It firstly assigns `max_ports` according to the `port_config` variable. Then it calculates the total number of enabled ports (`num_ports`). After that, the function traverses through the enabled ports and places the port number in the corresponding bits of the `rr` value, this is done in reverse order. Finally, the `blso` function is called to shift the bits in `rr` according to the number of slots and enabled ports [Implementation details of the block].
