    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for assigning specific bit values from the RxStatus_s bus to the RxIRQEn and WrapRxStatusBit signals. The RxIRQEn is set based on the 14th bit of the RxStatus_s, and the WrapRxStatusBit is determined by the 13th bit of the same bus. This particular implementation allows for the individual control of RxIRQEn and WrapRxStatusBit based on certain bit positions from the larger RxStatus_s bus."
