    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a wire assignment in Verilog, which is driving the 'Transmitting' signal. The 'Transmitting' signal is high when 'r_FullD' is not filled and 'WillTransmit_q2' is high, indicating a condition in which transmission is allowed. This block achieves its function through the use of bitwise operations and assignments."
