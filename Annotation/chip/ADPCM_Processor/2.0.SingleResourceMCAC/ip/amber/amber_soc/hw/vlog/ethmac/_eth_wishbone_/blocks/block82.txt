Comment: 
This block handles the control of the buffer under-run status (TxUnderRun_wb) in a transmitter system. The status is updated based on several conditions: reset signal (Reset), abort pulse (TxAbortPulse), and when the transmitter buffer is empty and the system is reading data from the FIFO buffer (TxBufferEmpty & ReadTxDataFromFifo_wb). If the system is reset or an abort signal is encountered, under-run status is cleared (TxUnderRun_wb is set to '0'). If the transmitter buffer is empty while reading from the FIFO, under-run status is set (TxUnderRun_wb is set to '1'), indicating a potential under-run situation.
