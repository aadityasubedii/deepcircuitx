    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog RTL handles data read operations under certain conditions. The block gets activated on the positive edge of the given i_clk signal. If the i_wb_read_data_valid signal is high, it signifies that valid read data is ready to be read. Two operations then take place: 'read_data_filtered_r' gets the current value of 'read_data_filtered' and 'load_rd_r' is assigned specific subsets of bits from 'i_wb_load_rd'."
