    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional code generation block that generates pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS). The PRBS generator block is instantiated if the CMD_PATTERN is either \"CGEN_PRBS\" or \"CGEN_ALL\". The instantiation of cmd_prbs_gen is parameterized, taking in constants like TCQ and FAMILY among others, and command configurations like 32-bit address width, 15-bit seed width, and 20-bit PRBS width. The generated block prbs_bl receives inputs like the clock signal (clk_i),  command clock enable signal (cmd_clk_en), initial seed (load_seed_i), and the PRBS seed (cmd_seed_i[16:2]). It outputs the pseudorandom binary sequence (prbs_bl)."
