    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the synchronization of the 'TxStartFrm' signal in respect to 'MTxClk' clock signal. It uses a latch that is sensitive to the rising edge of either the 'MTxClk' clock signal or the 'Reset' signal. If the 'Reset' signal goes high, the 'TxStartFrm_sync1' latch is cleared immediately and holds the value '0'. Otherwise, the current value of 'TxStartFrm_wb' is stored into 'TxStartFrm_sync1' at the next rising edge of 'MTxClk'."
