    "block_comment": "This is a state machine controlling the operations of a processor. The block defines transitions between states based on the current \"control_state\". The system begins at a certain state and the next state is decided by multiple \"if\" conditions. The condition checks include not just the current state but also other signals like \"write_pc\", \"mtrans_instruction_nxt\", \"dabt\", and \"instruction_execute\" etc. The final part of the block implements conditions for handling instructions such as transfers, multiply, swap, and interruption, where the next state is determined based on the type of operation and the presence of any conflicts or requests. The \"control_state_nxt\" represents the next state of the system."
