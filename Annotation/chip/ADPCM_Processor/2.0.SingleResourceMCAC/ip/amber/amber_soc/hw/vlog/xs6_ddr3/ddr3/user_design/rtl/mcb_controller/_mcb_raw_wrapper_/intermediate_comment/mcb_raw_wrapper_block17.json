    "block_comment": "This block generates a number of OSERDES2 components based on the C_NUM_DQ_PINS. Each OSERDES2 serves as a high-speed serial-to-parallel data conversion component with certain parameters defined, such as data rates, output mode, and SERDES mode. The block establishes loop connections with dq_oq, dq_tq, dqo_p, and dqo_n, and uses certain constants and system signals like ioclk90 and int_sys_rst for the clock and reset control respectively. It uses 'dqIO_w_en_0' for T1 and T2 inputs and 'ioi_drp_train' for the TRAIN signal. D3, D4, T3, T4, and several other signals are set to have no effect (set to constants such as 1'b0 or 1\u2019b1). By iterating over dq index ranging from 0 to C_NUM_DQ_PINS, it effectively sets up multiple OSERDES2 instances with shared design but varying dq-based connections."
