The block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for generating a Grey code for the next write operation. At each clock cycle, it takes the write pointer (wr_ptr) as an input and converts the binary value of the write pointer to the corresponding Grey code. This implementation is done via a loop that XORs each bit of the write pointer with its succeeding bit, storing the result in wr_gray_nxt, thus achieving the binary to Gray code conversion.
