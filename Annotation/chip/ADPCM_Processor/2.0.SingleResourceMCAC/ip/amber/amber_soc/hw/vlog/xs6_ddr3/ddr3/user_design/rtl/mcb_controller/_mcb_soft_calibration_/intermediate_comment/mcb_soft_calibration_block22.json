    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for the generation of a reset signal (`non_violating_rst`) in the circumstance where the original reset (`RST`) is true and a specific condition (`Rst_condition1`) is met. The implementation is straightforward: it uses an AND bitwise operation (`&`) to combine the reset signal (`RST`) and the condition signal (`Rst_condition1`), which results in issuing `non_violating_rst` only when both signals are high(`1`)."
