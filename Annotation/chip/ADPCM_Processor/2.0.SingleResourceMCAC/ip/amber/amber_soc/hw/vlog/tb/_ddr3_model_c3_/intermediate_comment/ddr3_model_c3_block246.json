    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code is functioning as a basic delay model, specifically used to introduce a delay in the signal 'ck_n'. The implementation is achieved via the usage of a non-blocking assignment in an always block which is triggered upon any change in 'ck_n'. The '#BUS_DELAY' syntax is introducing the specified delay in the propagation of the signal, causing 'ck_n_in' to adopt the value of 'ck_n' after 'BUS_DELAY' units of time."
