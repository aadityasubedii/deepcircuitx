Comment: 
The block of code primarily serves a reset function where it resets the 'force_rd' signal on rising edge of the input clock (clk_i). The implementation begins with a check on the 5th bit of the reset input (rst_i). For this bit high, 'force_rd' is set to 0 after a delay specified by TCQ. If this condition is not met, it checks the 4th bit of 'force_rd_counts'. If this bit is high, 'force_rd' is set to 1 after the delay. If both conditions are not met, 'force_rd' is then set to 0 after the delay.
