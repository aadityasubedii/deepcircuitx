    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog corresponds to a specific state of a control state machine (MTRANS_EXEC3 state). During this state and when instruction execution is enabled, several control signals are updated for specific actions in the processor pipeline. It primarily sets the address selection, program counter write enable, and barrel shifter data select signals. Within this state, if the 21st bit of the instruction register is enabled and there is no data abort, a register bank write select signal is updated. Moreover, when specific instructions are detected (23rd and 21st bits or 23rd and 21st bits along with a status register), user mode register load or store operations are triggered respectively."
