    "block_comment": "Sorry, but your provided block of code is incomplete. It only includes an `endif` statement, which is part of Verilog preprocessor compiler directives that work with conditional compilation (\"`ifdef\"/\"`else\"/\"`endif\"). To generate a comment for a block of Verilog RTL code, we need a complete and functional block of code. Please provide a comprehensive code for better assistance."
