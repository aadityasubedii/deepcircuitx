    "block_comment": "This block of code extracts various fields from a given `execute_instruction` for an ARM processor. Each assignment corresponds to a specific part of this instruction. The opcode is extracted from bits 21 to 24 and condition codes from bits 28 to 31. The `s_bit`, `reg_n`, `reg_d`, `reg_m`, and `reg_s` obtain their values from designated bit-ranges within the instruction. Similarly, `shift_imm`, `offset12`, `offset8` and `imm8` extract their respective values. The specifically assigned bit ranges correspond to the ARM instruction format. A special condition, `no_shift`, is set if bits 4 to 11 are all 0s. Lastly, the `mtrans_itype` extracts from bits 23 to 24 of the instruction."
