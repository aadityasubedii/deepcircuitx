    "block_comment": "This block assigns the next state to the state machine in the design, synchronized with the posedge of DRP_CLK. The block uses an \"always\" block to assign new state values on every clock cycle. Upon reset (as indicated by sync_rst), it brings the system back to the READY state, otherwise it advances to the \"nextstate\", as determined by the rest of the modules in your logic design."
