Comment: 
The code block is a latch that memorizes the status of 'valid bits'. During the positive edge of the clock signal i_clk, if the current state is idle state (CS_IDLE), it latches the valid bits from a 2-way cache line's tag data. The valid bits are determined by the last bits (TAG_WIDTH-1) from the tag data of way 0 and way 1 (tag_rdata_way[0], tag_rdata_way[1]).
