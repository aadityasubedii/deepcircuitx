This block of code handles the assignment of memory bank address, row address, and column address based on port configuration and certain memory parameters. When the C_PORT_CONFIG equals a certain value, it checks the width of memory bank address, memory address, and number of column bits. According to different situations, it assigns values to p4_cmd_ba, p4_cmd_ra, p4_cmd_ca, p5_cmd_ba, p5_cmd_ra, and p5_cmd_ca accordingly. Certain assigns append zeros at the beginning if conditions aren't met, while others directly assign substring of given variable. Column address assignment also considers appending a zero at the end.
