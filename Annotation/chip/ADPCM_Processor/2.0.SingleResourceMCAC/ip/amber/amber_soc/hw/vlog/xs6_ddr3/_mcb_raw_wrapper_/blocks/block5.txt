This block is responsible for generating input-output buffers (IOBUFs) for each data query (DQ) pin. It employs a loop that iterates through each DQ pin as specified by the constant `C_NUM_DQ_PINS`. Within the loop, IOBUFs are instantiated with connectivity `.IO` established to the DRAM data query `mcbx_dram_dq`, `.I` connected to `ioi_dq`, `.T` linked with `t_dq`, and `.O` matched with `in_pre_dq`. The index `dq_i` modifies these connections for each DQ pin.
