Comment: 
This block of code manages writeback acknowledgments and data responses of two slave interfaces (s1, s2) for a particular master interface (m1). The behavior of the block is sensitive to changes in the status variables m1_in_progress, m1_wb_adr_i, s1_wb_ack_i, s2_wb_ack_i, s1_wb_dat_i, s2_wb_dat_i, `M1_ADDRESSED_S1, and `M1_ADDRESSED_S2. If a transaction is in progress (m1_in_progress), it checks which slave is addressed (`M1_ADDRESSED_S1 or `M1_ADDRESSED_S2) and then assigns the respective slave's acknowledgment and data responses to the master's output. If no transaction is in progress, it maintains m1's ack signal low.
