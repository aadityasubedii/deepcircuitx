    "block_comment": "The block of code regulates the data flow in a pipeline implemented in Verilog. At every rising edge of `clk_i`, the block evaluates and updates four variables related to pipeline data flow and clock signals. `instr_vld` and `bl_out_clk_en` get true if either `cmd_clk_en` is true or both `mode_load_pulse` and `first_load_pulse` are true, applying a delay of `#TCQ`. Following this, `bl_out_vld` is assigned the value of `bl_out_clk_en` after a delay of `#TCQ`. Lastly, `pipe_data_in_vld` is assigned the value of `instr_vld` again after a delay of `#TCQ`. This operational logic ensures the correct synchronization and flow of data inside the pipeline."
