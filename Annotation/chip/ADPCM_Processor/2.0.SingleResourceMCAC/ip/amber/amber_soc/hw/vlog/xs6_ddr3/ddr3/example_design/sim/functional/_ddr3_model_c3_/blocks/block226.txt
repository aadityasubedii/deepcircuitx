The function `ceil` computes the ceiling of an input number (i.e., rounds the number up to the nearest integer). It takes a real number as an input and checks if the number is greater than its integer equivalent (`$rtoi(number)`). If so, `ceil` equals the integer part + 1 (effectively rounding upwards); otherwise, `ceil` equals the number itself (indicating that the number was already an integer). Thus, this function implements rounding up to the nearest integer in Verilog.
