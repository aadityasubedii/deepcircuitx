    "block_comment": "This block of code is performing a system reset. Initially, the `sysrst` signal is set to high, indicating a system reset. After a delay of 40000 time units, the `sysrst` signal is returned to low, representing the end of the reset period. This is a common way to simulate a reset scenario during system-level or functionality testing."
