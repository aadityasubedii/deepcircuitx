    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a flip-flop clocked on the positive edge of the signal `clk_i`. It takes an incoming `data_error_i` signal and, after a delay defined by the time constant `TCQ`, assigns it to the `data_error_r` register on every positive edge of `clk_i`. In terms of hardware implementation, `data_error_i` passes through a delay element (represented by `#TCQ`) before being latched into `data_error_r` on each rising clock edge, ensuring synchronization with the rest of the design."
