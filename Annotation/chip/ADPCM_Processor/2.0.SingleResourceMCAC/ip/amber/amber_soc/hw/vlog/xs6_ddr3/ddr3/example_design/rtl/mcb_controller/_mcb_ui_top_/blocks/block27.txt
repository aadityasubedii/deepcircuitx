Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for assigning outputs for the BUFPLL module. The implementation is achieved by directly assigning the corresponding input clocks and clock enable signals to the outputs. The output 'sysclk_2x_bufpll_o' is assigned the value of the input 'ioclk0', 'sysclk_2x_180_bufpll_o' is assigned 'ioclk180', and the clock enable signals 'pll_ce_0_bufpll_o' and 'pll_ce_90_bufpll_o' are assigned 'pll_ce_0_i' and 'pll_ce_90_i' respectively. The module appears to serve as a pass-through for these signals, likely after undergoing some form of processing inside the BUFPLL.
