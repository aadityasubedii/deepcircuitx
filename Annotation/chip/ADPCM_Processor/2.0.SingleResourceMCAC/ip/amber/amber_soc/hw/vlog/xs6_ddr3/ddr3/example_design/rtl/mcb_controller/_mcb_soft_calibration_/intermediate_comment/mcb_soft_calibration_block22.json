    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a part of a state machine implementation, specifically handling the 'WAIT_FOR_UODONE' state. The block mainly ensures system readiness for the following operations and manages the transition flow between different states. Initially, 'Pre_SYSRST' is set to low, signifying that the system is not in a reset state. When 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' and 'MCB_UODONECAL' signals are high, indicating readiness and calibration completion, 'MCB_UICMDEN' is enabled and 'DQS_DELAY_INITIAL' is computed by a 'Mult_Divide' function. Consecutively, the system state transitions to 'LDQS_WRITE_POS_INDELAY'. If the conditions are not met, the system remains in the 'WAIT_FOR_UODONE' state, essentially creating a wait loop until conditions are satisfied."
