    "block_comment": "This block assigns the most significant three bits of the `bram_cmd_i` input to the `bram_instr_i` output. The `bram_instr_i` output could be interpreted as an instruction or command type, with the specific instruction being determined by the bits received from the `bram_cmd_i`[32:30]. This is a straightforward bitwise operation which performs the role of instruction extraction or decoding."
