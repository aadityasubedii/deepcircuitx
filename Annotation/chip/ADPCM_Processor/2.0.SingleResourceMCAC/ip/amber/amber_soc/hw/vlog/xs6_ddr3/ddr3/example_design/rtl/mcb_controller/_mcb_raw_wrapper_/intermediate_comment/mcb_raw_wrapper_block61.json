    "block_comment": "This block configures the interface for a memory controller to handle 32-bit write operations. If the port configuration is \"B32\" and \"W32\", it checks whether the 5th port is enabled. If so, it sets up the clock, data, mask, and enable signal for write operations, as well as flags and counters related to write operations. If the port is not enabled, no assignments take place.\n"
