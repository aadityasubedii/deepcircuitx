    "block_comment": "This block of code handles conditions for an exclusive read event from the cache. It utilizes an assignment statement in Verilog that is continuously checking if `exclusive_access` (probably a signal indicating exclusive access operation) is high and write enable (`i_write_enable`) is not active (low), while the cache state (`c_state`) is not idle (`CS_IDLE`). It assigns `true` to `ex_read_cache_busy` under these specific conditions, implying that the cache is busy with an exclusive read operation."
