This block is responsible for initiating the write operation to a memory cell address with non-terminating (NTerm) characteristics. It does this by setting the address, write mode, and data of the I/O Data Rate Control Register (IODRPCTRLR), and assigning the User Data-Strobe Quarter Data-Strobe (UDQS) Pin to the Memory Controller Block (MCB) address. It also signals the start of this operation by making the command valid. Finally, it uses a condition based on the MCB's readiness state to either write or wait, controlling the flow of the operation.
