    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for triggering a timing check whenever there is a change in the 25th bit of the 'dq_in' parallel data bus. This is achieved using an 'always' block in Verilog, which monitors the 25th bit (index 24) of 'dq_in' and calls the function 'dq_timing_check' with the bit index as an argument anytime a change is detected."
