    "block_comment": "The Verilog block primarily governs data generation and manipulation based on certain input signal conditions. This block checks for specific conditions set by clock signals, FIFO ready indications, and command starts. Upon the activation of a command start signal, the data generation operation is triggered. The type of data generated is determined by the signal `addr_i[9:5]` and `data_mode_i`. In one condition, the data mode '4'b0101', `w1data` is assigned a value generated by 'Data_Gen' function, otherwise by 'Data_GenW0'. For different addr_i ranges, different indices are given to Data_Gen or Data_GenW0. If `MEM_BURST_LEN == 8` then `w1data` are calculated by certain bit-level shifts and concatenation. Default behavior is to assign zero to `w1data` in the case of an unforeseen condition."
