It monitors various inputs related to data errors and memory controller buffer statuses. When the code detects a data error, it sets an error status, including the address, dataline, Burst_Length (BL), and status of command, write, and read buffers in the memory controller. This error status is often used for debugging and fixing hardware issues. The status can be manually reset or reset by the system itself."
