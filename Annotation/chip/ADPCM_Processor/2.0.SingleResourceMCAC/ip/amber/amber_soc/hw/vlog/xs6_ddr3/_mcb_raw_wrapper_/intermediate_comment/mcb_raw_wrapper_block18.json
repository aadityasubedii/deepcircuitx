    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to declare two wire arrays, `dq_oq` and `dq_tq`. These arrays are directly used in digital processing for transmitting and reading data. The size of the arrays is determined by the constant `C_NUM_DQ_PINS`, which indicates the number of data pins in the system. The indexes are decreasing from `C_NUM_DQ_PINS-1` to `0`, defining two bit-vectors which could be used for parallel data transmission and reception tasks."
