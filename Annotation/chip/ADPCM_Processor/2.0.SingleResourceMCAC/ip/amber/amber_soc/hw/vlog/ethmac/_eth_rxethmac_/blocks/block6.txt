Comment: 
This block of code manages the state of the RxValid and RxValid_d signals in a data receiving module. The signals are updated at the rising edge of the master receive clock (MRxClk) or when a reset condition is encountered. If a reset signal is detected, both RxValid and RxValid_d are set to low, indicating that no valid data is currently being received. If no reset signal is detected, RxValid and RxValid_d are updated according to the value of GenerateRxValid, a signal which changes based on the data reception status.
