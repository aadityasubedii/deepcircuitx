    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of the least significant bit of the `shift_through_reg` register array to the `DRP_SDI` signal. This is achieved using the assign keyword, indicating a continuous assignment statement in Verilog. `DRP_SDI` is continuously updated with the value of `shift_through_reg[0]` whenever it changes."
