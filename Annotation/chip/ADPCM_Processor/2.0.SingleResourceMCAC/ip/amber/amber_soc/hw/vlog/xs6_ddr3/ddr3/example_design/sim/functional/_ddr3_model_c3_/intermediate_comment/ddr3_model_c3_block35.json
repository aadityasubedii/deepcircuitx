    "block_comment": "This code represents a basic timing check block in a circuit design. The function of the block is to trigger a timing check event (dqs_pos_timing_check) whenever there is a negative edge detected on the dqs_in[30] signal. This is achieved using the always @ (negedge dqs_in[30]) construct in Verilog, which specifies that the block should be evaluated every time when the dqs_in[30] signal transitions from a high voltage to a low voltage. As a result, a timing check event will be initiated at each negative edge instance of the signal."
