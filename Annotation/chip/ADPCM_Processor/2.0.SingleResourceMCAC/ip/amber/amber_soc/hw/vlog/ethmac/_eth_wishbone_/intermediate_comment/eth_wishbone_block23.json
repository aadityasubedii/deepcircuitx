    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the synchronization of the 'RxAbortSync3' signal, which is a third-stage synchronization register for 'RxAbort' in a dual-rank FPGA or ASIC design. Utilizing an 'always' block triggered on the positive edge of either 'WB_CLK_I' or 'Reset', the code updates 'RxAbortSync3'. If the reset signal is high, then 'RxAbortSync3' is asserted to be zero with a delay of 'Tp' units of time, ensuring an asynchronous reset operation. If reset is low, 'RxAbortSync3' adopts the value of the preceding stage 'RxAbortSync2', implying the second stage synchronization."
