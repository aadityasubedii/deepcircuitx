Module-level comment: 
/*
This module decompiles ARM processor instructions for debugging purposes.
It decodes incoming instructions, translates them into human-readable format,
and writes the execution information to a file. The module processes various
instruction types, handles interrupts, and tracks program flow. It uses
combinational logic for instruction decoding and sequential logic for
timing and synchronization with the processor's execution.
