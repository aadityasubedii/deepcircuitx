This block, labeled PORT4_NO_TG, is responsible for resetting error and comparison data flags associated with Port 4. Specifically, it makes use of Verilog's 'assign' command to set all error flags and comparison data (p4_error, p4_error_status, p4_cmp_data, p4_cmp_data_valid, p4_cmp_error) to their default '0' or false state. This suggests the block gets executed when there's no ongoing transaction with Port 4.
