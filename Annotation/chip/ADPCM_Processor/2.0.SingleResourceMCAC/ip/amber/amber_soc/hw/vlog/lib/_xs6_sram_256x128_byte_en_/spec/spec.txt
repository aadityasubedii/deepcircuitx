Module name: xs6_sram_256x128_byte_en.
Module specification: The module represents a byte-addressable 256x128 SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) that operates on a 128-bit data-width. It uses four internal blocks of dual-port RAM, allowing simultaneous read and write operations, all controlled by an overarching clock signal, i_clk. The input ports include i_write_data (data to be written into memory), i_write_enable (control for memory write operation), i_address (address signal specifying memory location for operations), and i_byte_enable (control for byte-level writing). The output port, o_read_data, retrieves the data read from the memory. An internal signal, byte_write_enable, controls which bytes are enabled for the write operation. It is generated by bitwise AND of the write enable signal expanded to DATA_WIDTH/8 bits and i_byte_enable signal. The module also includes a generate block which creates four instances of a primitive RAMB8BWER block, each managing an individual segment of the total data width. To ensure correct parameters, an initial block checks the DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH parameters during initialization and issues warnings if values other than the 128-bit data width and the 8-bit address width are specified.
