Comment: 
This block is responsible for updating a read operation data, 'read_data', based on specific control signals. It uses a rising edge clock DRP_CLK for syschronization. Initially, the 'read_data' is reset to 0 when a synchronous reset 'sync_rst' signal is active. Otherwise, it only assigns the value of the 'shift_through_reg' to 'read_data' when the state machine reaches the 'ALMOST_READY3' state. Thus, it ensures that 'read_data' gets updated in a controlled manner.
