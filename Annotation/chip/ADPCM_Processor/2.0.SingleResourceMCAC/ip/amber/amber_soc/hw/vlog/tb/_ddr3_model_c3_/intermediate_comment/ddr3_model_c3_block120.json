    "block_comment": "This block initiates a timing check routine for the 11th bit in the data queue input ('dq_in'). Whenever the value of the 11th bit changes, it triggers the function 'dq_timing_check()' with an argument of 10. The purpose of this check is likely to ensure data synchronization or monitor timing violations."
