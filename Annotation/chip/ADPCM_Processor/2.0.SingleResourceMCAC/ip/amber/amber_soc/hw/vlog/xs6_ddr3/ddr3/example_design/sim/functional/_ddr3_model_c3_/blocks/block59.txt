[2574, 2574]
Comment: 
This block of Verilog code uses a procedural block to monitor for positive edge transitions in the signal 'dqs_in[6]'. Upon sensing a positive edge transition, it activates the dqs_pos_timing_check function with 6 as the input argument. The function 'dqs_pos_timing_check' presumably implements the necessary timing checks associated with a positive edge transition in the signal 'dqs_in[6]'.
