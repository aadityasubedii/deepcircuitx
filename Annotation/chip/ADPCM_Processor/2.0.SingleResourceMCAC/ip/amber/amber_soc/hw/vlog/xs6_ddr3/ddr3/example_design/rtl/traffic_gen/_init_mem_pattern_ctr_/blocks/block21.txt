Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code essentially operates as a memory address control block. It controls updating a memory address under specific conditions synchronized to the rising edge of a clock signal. If a reset signal 'rst_i' is high, the current address is reset to a predefined start address 'BEGIN_ADDRESS'. Otherwise, if a write enable signal 'mcb_wr_en_i' is high and the current system state meets certain conditions (either initializing memory write with write or bi-directional port mode, or idle with read port mode), the address is advanced by a specified increment 'INC_COUNTS'. In the absence of these signals, the current address remains unchanged.
