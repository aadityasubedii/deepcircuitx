    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code represents an initialization phase where command strings associated with different operational modes of a memory module are assigned predefined string values. It adopts a direct mapping approach where predefined constant identifiers like LOAD_MODE, REFRESH, PRECHARGE, etc., representing different command modes, are mapped to corresponding string representations such as \"Load Mode\", \"Refresh\", \"Precharge\", and so on. These string mappings are stored in an array cmd_string and can be used to convey operational states of the memory module in a human-readable format."
