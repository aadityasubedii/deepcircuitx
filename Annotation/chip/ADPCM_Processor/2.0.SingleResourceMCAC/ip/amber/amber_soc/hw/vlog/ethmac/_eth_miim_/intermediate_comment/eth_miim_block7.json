    "block_comment": "This block implements a bit counter for an application-specific purpose, and it's sensitive to clock or reset signals. When the reset signal is asserted high, the counter resets to zero using 7-bit binary code 'h0. However, when the reset is not activated, and 'MdcEn' and 'InProgress' flags are active, if a condition - 'NoPre' asserting with the counter at zero - is satisfied, the counter is set to 'h21. Otherwise, it is incremented by 1 with each clock pulse. The 'InProgress' signal is used to distinguish whether the counter keeps counting or is reset to zero. This counter operates synchronously, counting or resetting at the rising edge of the clock signal."
