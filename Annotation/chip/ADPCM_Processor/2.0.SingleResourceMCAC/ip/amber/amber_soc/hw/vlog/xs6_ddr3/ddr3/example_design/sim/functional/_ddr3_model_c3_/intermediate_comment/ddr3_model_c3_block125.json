    "block_comment": "This block is a timing check procedure for a specific bit of the 'dq_in' signal array, specifically the sixth bit. It accomplishes this task by continuously monitoring changes to the sixth bit through the use of the 'always' keyword and subsequently invoking the 'dq_timing_check' function whenever a change is detected. The function number argument indicates the bit number that is being monitored. Please note that 'dq_in' is a multi-bit signal array, and to monitor different bits, similar blocks of code must be written for each bit. This structure provides a flexible and easy way to modify or add more timing check processes to different bits of the 'dq_in' signal."
