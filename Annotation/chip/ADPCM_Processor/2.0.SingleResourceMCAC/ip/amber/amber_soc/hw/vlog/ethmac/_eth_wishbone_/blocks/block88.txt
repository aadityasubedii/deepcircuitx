Comment: 
This block of code manages the transmission state of data packets. At the rising edge of a Write Buffer Clock (WB_CLK_I) or a System Reset, the block checks if a reset has occurred. If so, it marks the packet transmission as 'not completed'. If the transmission is enabled and the packet transmission has not been cleared, it marks the transmission as 'not completed'. If a data packet has been completely transmitted and is not part of a burst transmission, or if there are no other packets blocking transmission, then the block marks the packet as 'completed'.
