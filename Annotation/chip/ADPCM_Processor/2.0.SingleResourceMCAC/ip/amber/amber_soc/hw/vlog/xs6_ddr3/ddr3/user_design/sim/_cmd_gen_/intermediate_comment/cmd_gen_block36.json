    "block_comment": "This block of code is for loading a mode into the `bl_mode_reg` register and propagating the `mode_load_i` signal through a two-stage pipeline. Upon a rising edge of clock `clk_i`, if `mode_load_pulse` is high, the input mode `bl_mode_i` is loaded into the register `bl_mode_reg` with `#TCQ` delay. Simultaneously, the `mode_load_i` input is piped through a two-stage delay line formed by `mode_load_d1` and `mode_load_d2`, with each stage delayed by `#TCQ`."
