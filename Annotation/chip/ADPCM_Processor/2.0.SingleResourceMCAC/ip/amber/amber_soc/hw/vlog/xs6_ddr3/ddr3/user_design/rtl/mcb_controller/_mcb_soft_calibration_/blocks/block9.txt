The code block handles the state transitions for a dynamic calibration process in a system. Using UI_CLK's positive edge as a sensitivity point, it checks whether the system reset (RST) is asserted. If yes, it resets the variable State_Start_DynCal to `0`. If not, it checks whether the current state (STATE) is 'Start Dynamic Calibration' (START_DYN_CAL). If it matches, it sets State_Start_DynCal to `1`, implying that dynamic calibration state has begun; otherwise, it sets State_Start_DynCal back to `0`, intimating that dynamic calibration state hasn't started.
