    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for resetting or incrementing the Transmit Pointer based on different conditions. On a rising edge of the Write Back Clock or a positive edge of the Reset, the 'BlockingIncrementTxPointer' is either reset or incremented. When Reset is set or when a master access operation has finished, 'BlockingIncrementTxPointer' is reset. Conversely, when there's a trigger to increment the Transmit Pointer, 'BlockingIncrementTxPointer' is set to 1."
