This block carries out the function of invoking the 'dm_timing_check' procedure whenever there is a transition on 'dm_in' at the 14th bit position. This is realized through the 'always' keyword which in Verilog denotes a continuous loop that triggers whenever the specified inputs change states. The specific input here is the 14th bit of 'dm_in' as indicated by 'dm_in[13]'. The numerical index starts from zero, thus '13' refers to the 14th bit. The procedure 'dm_timing_check(13)' is invoked each time the 14th bit changes state.
