    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the interface between memory controller block (MCB) and a two-way AXI interface depending on the AXI-enable status. It uses simple data assignments if AXI is disabled; otherwise, it connects to the MCB via the AXI interface. The block also includes an AXI MCB module for data transfer from AXI to MCB, if the AXI is enabled. The implementation also showcases the use of the synchronous signal method for calibration completion check."
