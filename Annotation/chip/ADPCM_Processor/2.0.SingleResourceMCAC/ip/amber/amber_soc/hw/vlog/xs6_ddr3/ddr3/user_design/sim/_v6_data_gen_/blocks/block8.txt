The function of this block is to perform a bitwise exclusive or (XOR) operation between each corresponding pair of bits within two data arrays, 'w1data' and 'hdata', and store the results in the 'ndata'. This is achieved through the use of a 'for' loop, which iterates over each index in the arrays, from '0' to '4*NUM_DQ_PINS - 1'. Within each iteration of this loop, the XOR operation between the corresponding elements of 'w1data' and 'hdata' is computed and assigned to the respective index in 'ndata'.
