    "block_comment": "This block defines an instantiation of an Ethernet receive controller (eth_receivecontrol) module named receivecontrol1. This module handles the reception of ethernet frames and checks their validity, including length and CRC checks. It also manages the reception and detection of Pause frames and provides signals that denote the status of the received frames. Internally, it synchronizes the received data to system clocks, handles reset conditions, and interfaces with MAC for addressing. It signals the end of reception which can be used for downstream processing. The controller also handles flow control by signaling backpressure information using the RxFlow and Pause signals."
