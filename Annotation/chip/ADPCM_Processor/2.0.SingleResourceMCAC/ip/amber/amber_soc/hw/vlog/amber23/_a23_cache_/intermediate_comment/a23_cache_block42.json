    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to assign a true or '1' value to the 'enable' signal when both 'i_select' and 'i_cache_enable' signals are true. Specifically, the 'assign' keyword is used to create combinational logic. The '&&' is a logical AND operator, which means both 'i_select' and 'i_cache_enable' signals should be '1' or true for the 'enable' signal to be assigned a true value. In other words, this block integrates two separate conditions - 'i_select' and 'i_cache_enable' - into a single 'enable' signal that can conveniently control downstream logic."
