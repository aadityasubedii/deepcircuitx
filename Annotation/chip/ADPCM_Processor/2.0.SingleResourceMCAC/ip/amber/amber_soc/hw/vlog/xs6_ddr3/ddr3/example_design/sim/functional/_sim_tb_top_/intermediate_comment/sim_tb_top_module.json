    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"sim_tb_top\" module is a top-level DDR3 memory model simulation testbench. Without any I/O ports, it internally generates the system clock and reset signals, along with DRAM interface signals. It instantiates and drives the \"example_top\" module (DUT) and DDR3 memory model 'ddr3_model_c3' accordingly. The module monitors the caliberation and error states during the test and reports the status (\"TEST PASSED\" or \"TEST FAILED\") based on the test result."
