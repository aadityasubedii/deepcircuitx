    "block_comment": "The main function of the block is to monitor the system timing and sequences of different operations in a DDR memory system. Specifically, it handles situations such as resetting the system, activating and terminating self-refresh mode, checking for timing violations, managing DLL status, and managing banking activities. It sets flags and prints error or information messages based on the sequence of events and the sequence's compliance with predefined rules. Implementation-wise, it primarily uses a broad set of conditional statements (if conditions and case statements), timing control (using $time function), and continuous assignments to maintain system state, sequence control, variable updates, and checks. It uses a large number of predefined DDR system parameters (like TJIT_PER, TCKSRE, TCKSRE_TCK etc.) to affect the control flow and timing. Additionally, it utilizes Verilog's delay constructs (#) to simulate actual hardware behavior."
