    "block_comment": "This block of code is running a timing check procedure on the 6th element of `dm_in` array. The procedure `dm_timing_check` is called any time the 6th element of this Verilog array changes. The `always @` statement is an event control construct, which allows this bit-select index to be sensitive to any update, triggering the timing check function accordingly."
