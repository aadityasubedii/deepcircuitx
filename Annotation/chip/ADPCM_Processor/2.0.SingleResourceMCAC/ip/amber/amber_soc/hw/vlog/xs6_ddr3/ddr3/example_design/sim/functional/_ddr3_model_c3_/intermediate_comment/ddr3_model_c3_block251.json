    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for initializing the strings associated with different operation modes in DRAM functioning. These operations include load mode, refresh, precharge, activate, write, read, impedance control (ZQ), no action (NOP), power down, and self-refresh. The implementation is simple and direct, just assigning corresponding string descriptions to the different opcodes for easy debugging or visibility during runtime."
