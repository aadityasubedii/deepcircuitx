Comment: 
This block generates a delayed version of the input clock signal `ck_n` using a delay model. It leverages level-sensitive (always) block that is constantly looking for changes in `ck_n`. Whenever there's a change in `ck_n`, `ck_n_in` receives a delayed version of `ck_n`, with the delay specified as `BUS_DELAY`.
