Comment: 
The block dynamically assigns a value to the variable 'prbs_brlen' based on the family of the IC and the value of 'prbs_bl'. If the IC belongs to the "SPARTAN6" family and 'prbs_bl' value is '000000', 'prbs_brlen' is assigned the value '000001'. Otherwise, its value is the same as that of 'prbs_bl'. If the IC is not part of the "SPARTAN6" family, regardless of the 'prbs_bl' value, 'prbs_brlen' is always assigned '000010'.
