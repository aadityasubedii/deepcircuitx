    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block handles the resetting and sampling of the 'ShortFrame' signal in a digital communication control system. When a rising edge is detected on 'Reset' or 'MRxClk', the block is activated. It then resets the 'ShortFrame' on receiving a 'Reset' or 'LoadRxStatus' signal. However, when it gets a 'TakeSample' signal, it compares 'RxByteCnt' with 'r_MinFL' and accordingly sets 'ShortFrame'. The delay '#Tp' is added after each operation to synchronize it with the system clock."
