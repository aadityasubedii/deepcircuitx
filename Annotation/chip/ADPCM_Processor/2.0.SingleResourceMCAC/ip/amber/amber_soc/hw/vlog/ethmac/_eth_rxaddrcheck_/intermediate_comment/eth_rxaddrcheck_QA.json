The functionalities include unicasting (addressed to a single node), broadcasting (addressed to all nodes), and multicasting (addressed to a subset of nodes). If an incoming frame's address matches with the designed MAC address, the flag UnicastOK is set. Moreover, if a frame is a broadcast frame and broadcast reception is enabled, then the BroadcastOK flag is set. If it is a multicast frame and the receiving of multicast frames is enabled, then the MulticastOK flag is set. Further, it checks if the frame address is valid, and if not, it triggers an abort signal and an address miss signal."
