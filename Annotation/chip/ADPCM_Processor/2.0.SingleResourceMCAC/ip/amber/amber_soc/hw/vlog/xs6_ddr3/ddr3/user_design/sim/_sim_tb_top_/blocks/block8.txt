Comment: 
This block of code creates a system clock signal c3_sys_clk_n that is the negation of another system clock signal, c3_sys_clk. It achieves this using the bitwise NOT operator ("~") in Verilog, which is applied to the original system clock signal. The resultant signal could be used where inverted system clock cycles are required for subsequent operations.
