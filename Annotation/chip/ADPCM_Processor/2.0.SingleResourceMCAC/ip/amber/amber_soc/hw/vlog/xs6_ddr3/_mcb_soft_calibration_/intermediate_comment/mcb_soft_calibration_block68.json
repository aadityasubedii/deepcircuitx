    "block_comment": "This block of code is involved in resetting a system condition, conditioned on the state of a counter. The code listens for a positive edge signal on the user interface clock (UI_CLK), then checks whether the Reset Counter (RstCounter) has reached or surpassed the maximum count (TZQINIT_MAXCNT). If it has, it sets the Reset Condition1 (Rst_condition1) to true ('1), otherwise, it sets it to false ('0). The block implements a fundamental synchronizer pattern to align this system reset event with the UI clock domain."
