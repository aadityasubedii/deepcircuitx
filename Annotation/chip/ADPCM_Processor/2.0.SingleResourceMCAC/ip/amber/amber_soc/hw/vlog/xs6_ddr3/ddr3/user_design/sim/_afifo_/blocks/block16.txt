This block of code captures the current Write Pointer value. The `always@` block implements a memory capture system where it's triggered every time there's a change in the `wr_ptr`(Write Pointer) variable. Whenever a new value is written into `wr_ptr`, the same is also assigned to `wr_capture_ptr` preserving the new Write Pointer position.
