    "module": "Module-level Comment: This is the mcb_soft_calibration_top module, managing the calibration processes for memory configurations. It coordinates with sub-modules, utilizes registers for timing control, employs conditionally compiled blocks for variants, and interfaces with I/O buffers for signal alignment. Inputs include control clock, reset signal, and various calibration signals, while outputs comprise completion status, mode statuses, and interfaced signals. Registers manage skew, impedance and I/O buffer delay, providing robust clock-to-data time control. Internal signals preserve statuses and command control. Conveys comprehensive memory calibration control for diverse configurations."
