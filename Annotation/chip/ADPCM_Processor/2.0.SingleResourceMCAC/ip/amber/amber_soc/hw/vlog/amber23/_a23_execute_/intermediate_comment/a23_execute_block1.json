    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily performs conditional operations and mode assignment operations on input signals. The block checks the condition of 'i_condition' and assigns a specific string value to 'xCONDITION' based on the equality of 'i_condition' with predefined constants such as 'EQ', 'NE', 'CS', etc. Similarly, it inspects 'status_bits_mode' and assigns a corresponding string value to 'xMODE' based on whether the 'status_bits_mode' matches with constants like 'SVC', 'IRQ', 'FIRQ', and 'USR'. If no condition is met, default values are assigned."
