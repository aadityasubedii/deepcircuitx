    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning the value of the 'ReadStatusOp' wire in the hardware. The 'ReadStatusOp' wire is a combination of the two conditions 'RStatStart_q1' AND 'Not RStatStart_q2'. When both the conditions fulfill, i.e., when 'RStatStart_q1' is set (True) and 'RStatStart_q2' is cleared (False), the 'ReadStatusOp' wire is set. It is essentially implementing a two-condition requirement to trigger 'ReadStatusOp'."
