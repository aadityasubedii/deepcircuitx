    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'wb_ddr3_bridge' module bridges a Wishbone bus to a DDR3 memory interface for data transfer. It uses inputs such as address, data, and control signals from the Wishbone bus to generate DDR3 operations. Internal signals control read and write operations and monitor system readiness. The module is architected into several blocks that handle DDR3 command generation, data writing, read operations, and optional debug display. It also supports conditional compilation for Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA."
