This block of code manages the state of read command pending flag. It is clocked by the rising edge of 'clk_i'. When both 'cmd_rd' and 'push_cmd' flags are '1', it sets the 'cmd_rd_pending_r1' flag to '1' indicating a read command is pending. On the other hand, if the 'xfer_cmd' control signal is '1', it resets the 'cmd_rd_pending_r1' flag to '0' indicating no read command is pending. The delays modeled by '#TCQ' imply that these state changes occur after a certain propagation delay based on the technology, in synchronization with the clock signal.
