This block of code implements a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) pattern generator based on certain conditions. When the `DATA_PATTERN` type is "DGEN_PRBS" or "DGEN_ALL", a clock enabled signal `data_clk_en` is generated, which depends on the readiness signals `fifo_rdy_i`, `data_rdy_i` and the condition on `user_burst_cnt`. A module `data_prbs_gen` is instantiated with parameters and corresponding input and output signals. A 32-bit seed `prbs_seed_i`, extracted from bits 31:0 of the input address `addr_i`, is issued to generate the PRBS pattern data `prbs_data` which follows a particular seed pattern depending on the input signals. The clock enable signal is used to synchronize the generation to system-level controls.
