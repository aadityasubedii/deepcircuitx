Module-level comment: 
This is the 'main_mem' module, a parametrizable memory unit implemented in Verilog. It supports both 32 and 128-bit read/write operations, governed by 'i_mem_ctrl'. The module uses multiple input and output signals for handling various tasks: enabling/disabling read/write, addressing, data transfers, error handling, and operation acknowledgement. Memory is designed as an array of registers ('ram') with specific blocks ('wb128' and 'wb32') handling operations based on data width. Internal signals, along with handshake techniques, ensure seamless concurrency control during operations.
