    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a conditional data width processor for a WriteBack (WB) operation. If the data width (WB_DWIDTH) is found to be 128 bits, then it slices the provided data (i_wb_dat) into four 32-bit chunks based on the address (i_wb_adr) value. Specifically, it uses the two least significant bits of the address as selectors to determine which 32-bit chunk to process. In contrast, if the WB_DWIDTH is not 128 bits, it directly assigns the input data (i_wb_dat) into the output (wb_wdata32). Independent of the WB_DWIDTH, the code also assigns the processed 32-bit chunk of data (wb_rdata32) to the output (o_wb_dat)."
