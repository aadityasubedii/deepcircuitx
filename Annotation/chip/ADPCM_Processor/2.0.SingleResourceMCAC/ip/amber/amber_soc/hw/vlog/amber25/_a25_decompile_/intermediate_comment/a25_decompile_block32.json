    "block_comment": "This block of code is dedicated to opening a file for decompiling data. It uses a built-in Verilog system task $fopen to complete this task. The operation is performed during the initial phase of the simulation. The $fopen function is called with the macro `A25_DECOMPILE_FILE which is expected to provide the file name and \"w\" indicating that the file needs to be opened for writing. The file handle is stored in the variable decompile_file for subsequent use. The delay of #1 ensures that file opening operation is not instantaneous and mirrors real-world conditions."
