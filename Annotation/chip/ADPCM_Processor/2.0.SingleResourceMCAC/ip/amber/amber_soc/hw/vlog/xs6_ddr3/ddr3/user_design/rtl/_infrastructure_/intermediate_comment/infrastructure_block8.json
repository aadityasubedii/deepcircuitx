    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to create a global buffered version of the input clock signal. Practically, the instantiated BUFG component here, assigned as 'U_BUFG_CLK0', is a Global Clock Buffer that helps in reducing the clock skew across the design by routing the clock signal (clk0_bufg_in) through a balanced tree structure. The input clock signal (clk0_bufg_in) is fed into the BUFG, and the output (clk0_bufg) is the buffered version of this input signal. This block enhances the signal integrity for the synchronization of large FPGA designs."
