    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code determines the value to be assigned to the 'data_wdata' variable. This is achieved through the use of a combination of logical and conditional (`?:`) operators. It checks if there is a write_hit AND the control state (c_state) is idle (CS_IDLE). If this condition is satisfied, the 'write_hit_wdata' value is assigned to 'data_wdata'. If the condition is not satisfied, 'read_miss_wdata' value is assigned to 'data_wdata'."
