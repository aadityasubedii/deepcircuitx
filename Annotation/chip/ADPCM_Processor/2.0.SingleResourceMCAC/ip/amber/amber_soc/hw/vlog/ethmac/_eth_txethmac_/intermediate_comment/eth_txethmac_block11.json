    "block_comment": "This Verilog block assigns different 4-bit values to MTxD_d based on the current state of the system and other variables. The block operates by checking the conditions of StateData, StateFCS, StateJam, and StatePreamble one by one. If the system is in the StateData state, MTxD_d is assigned with either the lower or upper half of TxData based on the first two bits of StateData. If the system is in the StateFCS state, MTxD_d is assigned with the complement of the high nibble of Crc. In StateJam, a constant '1001' is assigned to MTxD_d. When the system is in StatePreamble state, depending on the NibCntEq15 value, MTxD_d is either assigned a '1101' or '0101'. If none of these states are active, MTxD_d is set to '0000'."
