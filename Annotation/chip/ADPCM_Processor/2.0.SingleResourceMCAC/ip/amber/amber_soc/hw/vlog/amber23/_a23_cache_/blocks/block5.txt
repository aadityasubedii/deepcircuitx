Comment: 
This block of code is an else-if control statement that checks if the WAYS variable is equal to 4 (Function of the block). If the condition is met, it executes the block of code under the label 'check_hit_4ways' (Implementation details of the block). Note that the comment would be more detailed and helpful with the context of what 'check_hit_4ways' does.
