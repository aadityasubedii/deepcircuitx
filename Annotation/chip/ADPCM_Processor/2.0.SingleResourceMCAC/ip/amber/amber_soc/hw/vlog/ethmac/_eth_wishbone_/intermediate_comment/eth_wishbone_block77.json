    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for the synchronous reset of the 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync1' signal. It ensures that either the rising edge of the 'WB_CLK_I' signal or the assertion of the 'Reset' signal resets this flag. When 'Reset' is high, 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync1' gets reset immediately. Otherwise, this signal gets the incoming 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_tck' value at the next positive edge of the 'WB_CLK_I'."
