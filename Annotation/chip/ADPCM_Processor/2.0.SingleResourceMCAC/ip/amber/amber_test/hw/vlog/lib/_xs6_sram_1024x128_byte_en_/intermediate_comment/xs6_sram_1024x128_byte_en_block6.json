    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes a dual-port synchronous SRAM, specifically targeting a Spartan-6 FPGA. The SRAM is given an initial state and configured to perform synchronous resets with 'CE' as the reset priority. Collision checks are configured to generate 'X' values and write operations are configured to be write-first. The SRAM instance is then instantiated, with Port A being actively enabled and all other control signals held stable in their inactive or default states."
