    "block_comment": "This block of code sets a procedural monitoring of the input signal `dm_in[ 4]` in the RTL design. Utilizing the `always` construct, the function `dm_timing_check( 4)` is invoked whenever there are any changes in the signal `dm_in[ 4]`. This function is likely purposed for ensuring the signal timing of `dm_in[ 4]` meets certain design stipulations."
