    "block_comment": "The given block of code corresponds to a function that updates a status flag, 'LateCollLatched', based on certain conditions. The flag 'LateCollLatched' is set to 0 when an active high reset signal 'Reset' is detected on the positive edge. When the condition is not met, 'LateCollLatched' is updated with the value of 'LateCollision' if either 'StartTxDone' or 'StartTxAbort' is active. This implies that whenever a start transmission state concludes successfully or aborts, the status of 'LateCollision' is captured for future use. The status update operation is sequential and synchronized with the positive edge of 'MTxClk'."
