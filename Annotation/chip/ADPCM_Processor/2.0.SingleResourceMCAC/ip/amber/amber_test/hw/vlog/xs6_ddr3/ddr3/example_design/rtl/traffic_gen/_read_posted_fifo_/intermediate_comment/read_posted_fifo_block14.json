    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a wait counter in a synchronous system. At each positive clock edge, it updates a variable `wait_cnt`. If a reset signal `rst_i` is detected, it initializes `wait_cnt` to zero. If an input command is valid (`cmd_valid_i`) and ready (`cmd_rdy_o`), it sets `wait_cnt` to 2. If `wait_cnt` is greater than zero and no particular command is ready, it decrements `wait_cnt` by 1. The decrementing operation is meant for potentially stalling some dependent code sections until certain condition is met."
