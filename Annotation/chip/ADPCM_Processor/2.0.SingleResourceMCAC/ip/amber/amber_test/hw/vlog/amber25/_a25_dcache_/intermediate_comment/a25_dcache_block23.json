    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the reset and maintenance of a hardware system. On a reset signal, it clears \"valid_bits_r\" to 0. However, in the absence of reset and when the system is in idle state (\"c_state\" equals \"CS_IDLE\"), the \"valid_bits_r\" variable is updated with the higher-order bits from the values stored in \"tag_rdata_way[3]\", \"tag_rdata_way[2]\", \"tag_rdata_way[1]\", and \"tag_rdata_way[0]\". The implementation leverages Verilog's event-driven and sensitivity list features to achieve these."
