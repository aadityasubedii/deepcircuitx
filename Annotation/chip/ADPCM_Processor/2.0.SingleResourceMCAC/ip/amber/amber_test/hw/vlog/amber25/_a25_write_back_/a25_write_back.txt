Module-level comment: The 'a25_write_back' module temporarily stores read data, read data validity, load register, and data address from memory. It uses input ports (like i_mem_stall for stalling, and i_mem_read_data and i_mem_load_rd for reading memory data and load registers) and registers (mem_read_data_r, mem_read_data_valid_r, mem_load_rd_r, and daddress_r). It updates them employing clock-sensitive always blocks contingent on reset and memory stall signals, ensuring synchronized output of these data via external ports.
