This Verilog codeblock represents an always block that is sensitive to any changes in "ras_n_in". Whenever "ras_n_in" changes, the function "cmd_addr_timing_check(1)" is called. The change of "ras_n_in" triggers the execution of the timing check function, therefore ensuring that the state and timing of system elements are correctly monitored and maintained.
