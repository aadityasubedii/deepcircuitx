This block configures the various MIG (Memory Interface Generator) ports if the Port Configuration is set to "B64_B32_B32" and the Port Enable flag is turned on. It remaps various ports, like arb_en, cmd_clk, cmd_en, cmd_ra, cmd_ba, cmd_ca, cmd_instr, cmd_bl, cmd_empty, wr_clk, and rd_clk, from the standard p0 designation to the MIG counterpart. This also includes conditional checks for the interface mode to be "AXI" where it the write enable and read enable signals are adjusted accordingly. In case of the port enable flag being off, the MIG ports are set to 0. The block smoothly handles and assigns split data, masks, and signals for write and read operations.
