    "block_comment": "This block of code triggers a timing check function whenever there is a positive edge on the 31st bit of the 'dqs_in' signal. The always block is sensitive to the specified signal's positive edge, thereby activating the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function with the input parameter 30, likely referring to the same bit of the signal."
