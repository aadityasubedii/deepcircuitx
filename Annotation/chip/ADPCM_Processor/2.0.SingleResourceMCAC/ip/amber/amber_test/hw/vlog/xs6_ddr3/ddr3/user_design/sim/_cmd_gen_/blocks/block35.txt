Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for address output generation under varying conditions. It operates on a positive edge clock signal, and first checks the reset input condition. If reset is high, the starter address is assigned to the output. In the absence of a reset signal, it evaluates the address mode register's value, and based on the encoded value, decides the format of the output address, ranging from the block RAM address, a fixed address, a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) address, to sequences that incorporate selected bits from a sequential address and PRBS address. If no case matches, a default zero value is assigned to the address output.
