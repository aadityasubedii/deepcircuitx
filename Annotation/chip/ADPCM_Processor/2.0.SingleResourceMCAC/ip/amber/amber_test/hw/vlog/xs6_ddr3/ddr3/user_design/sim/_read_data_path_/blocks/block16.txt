Comment: 
This block serves as an error-checking mechanism for data comparison. It executes at every positive edge of the clock signal (clk_i). It compares the read data (rd_data_r) with the comparison data (cmp_data_r) in two halves (upper and lower), flagged by cmp_data_en signal. If any mismatch is detected in either of the halves (l_data_error for lower and u_data_error for upper), it flags a data_error. If no comparison signal (cmp_data_en) is provided, no data errors are reported for both halves. If a data_error occurs, it displays the expected and received data along with the timestamp.
