    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code primarily serves as a delay counter (DlyCrcCnt) resetter and updater. At each positive edge of MRxClk or Reset, a series of conditional statements decide the value that DlyCrcCnt gets updated to. Initially, on Reset, DlyCrcCnt is set to 0. From then on, if DlyCrcCnt equals 9, it is reset. If the delay counter is enabled (DlyCrcEn) and in StateSFD, the counter is set to 1. If the delay counter is enabled and non-zero, it gets incremented by one."
