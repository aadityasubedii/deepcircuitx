    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the output data stream (TxDataOut) for a certain system. It employs a multiplexer (conveyed via ternary operator), directing either ControlData or TxDataIn to TxDataOut, based on the boolean value of CtrlMux. If CtrlMux is true, ControlData is passed to TxDataOut, otherwise, TxDataIn is utilized."
