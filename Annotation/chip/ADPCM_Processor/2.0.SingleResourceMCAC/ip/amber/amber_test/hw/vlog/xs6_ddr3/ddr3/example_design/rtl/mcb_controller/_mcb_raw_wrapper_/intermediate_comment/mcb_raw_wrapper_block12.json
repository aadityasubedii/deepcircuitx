    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to instantiate an output buffer for the DRAM RAS (Row Address Strobe) signal. Specifically, it is using the OBUFT (Output Buffer with 3-State Control) primitive in Verilog which has an output, input, and a 3-state control. The 'O' pin (mcbx_dram_ras_n) is connected to the output RAS signal for the memory controller block, the 'I' pin (ioi_ras) is connected to the input RAS signal from the IO block, and the 'T' pin (t_ras) is used to tri-state the 'O' pin based on the control logic."
