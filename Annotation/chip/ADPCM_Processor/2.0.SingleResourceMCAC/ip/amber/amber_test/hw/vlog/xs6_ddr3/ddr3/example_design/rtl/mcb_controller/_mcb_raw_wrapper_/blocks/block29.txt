This block of code generates an array of OSERDES2 modules which are used to serialize memory address data for output. Each instantiated OSERDES2 block takes in address data in parallel and converts it to a serial signal suitable for transmission over a single line. This is achieved by looping over the width of the memory address size using the generate keyword and instantiating an OSERDES2 module for each bit in the address. The address data is input separately into the D1 and D2 data input ports of each module, while the remaining D3 and D4 ports along with SHIFTIN ports and T ports are tied to logic 0 (false). The TQ outputs are connected to the 't_addr' array, and 'ioi_addr' array is driven by the OQ outputs of the OSERDES2 instances. The 'ioclk0' is used as the clocking source and 'int_sys_rst' functions as a reset signal, indicating the beginning of a new transmission.
