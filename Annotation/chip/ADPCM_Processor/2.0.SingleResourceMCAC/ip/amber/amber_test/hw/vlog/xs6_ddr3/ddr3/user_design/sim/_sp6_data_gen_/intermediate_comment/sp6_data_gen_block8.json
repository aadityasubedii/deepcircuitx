    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a part of a synchronous sequential logic circuit, executed at the positive edge of the 'clk_i' (clock input). On a hardware reset ('rst_i'), the 'hdata' variable is cleared to zero. On the other hand, when 'fifo_rdy_i' is ready and 'user_burst_cnt' isn't zero, or when 'cmd_startC' is true, 'hdata' is set based on the number of Data Query (DQ) pins. Specifically, it sets 'hdata' to hexadecimal value 'FFFF' for 16 pins, '00FF00FF' for 8 pins, and '0F0F0F0F' for 4 pins, each after 'TCQ' time units."
