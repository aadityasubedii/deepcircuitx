The block of code is used to manipulate the valid status of data. If the reset signal is active, the data_valid flag is set to '0' after a clock delay defined by TCQ. On receipt of a cmd_start signal, data_valid is set to '1', also after a TCQ delay. Moreover, if the FIFO buffer isn't full and the user_burst_cnt is less than or equal to 1, the data_valid is reset to '0', again after a TCQ delay.
