It is designed to be 256 words deep with each word being 21 bits wide, but seems to accommodate 36-bit wide data by dividing the data into lower 'read_data_lo' and higher 'read_data_hi' portions. The \"SDP\" mode is used indicating that it's configured as a simple dual-port memory. It uses equally shared read and write addresses and the read first mode, which implies that before new data is written into the memory, old data is read first. It also contains the write enable signal logic and initialization checks for Data Width and Address Width parameters. It reads and writes the data and addresses to/from the SRAM block. User can select a specific address to write data when write enable is active."

The width of this port is determined by the DATA_WIDTH parameter.\n3. i_write_enable: This is the write enable control signal. When high, it indicates that the data line holds valid data to be written.\n4. i_address: This is the address signal that determines a particular location in the memory where the data is to be written or read. The size of this port is determined by ADDRESS_WIDTH parameter.\n\nExplanation: All input ports contribute to the write and read operations of the memory. The 'i_clk' is used to update the memory state in a controlled manner. 'i_write_data' carries the data which needs to be written, 'i_write_enable' controls when the write operation takes place while 'i_address' selects the location for read and write operations.\n\nOutput Ports:\n\n1. o_read_data: This is the output data line. It outputs the content read from the memory at the location provided by the 'i_address'.\n\nExplanation: The output port 'o_read_data' is used to provide the data which is read from the SRAM. The 'i_address' selects the location from the SRAM, and the corresponding data is then put onto this output port.\n"

Specifically, this signal connects with the DOADO port of the RAM block to fetch the low bits of the data stored at the specified address. This is then combined with 'read_data_hi' to construct the complete 21-bit data to be served on 'o_read_data'.\n\n2. read_data_hi: This is also a 16-bit wide internal signal, however, it is used to store the higher bit value of the read data from the memory. This signal, similar to 'read_data_lo', connects with DOBDO port of the RAM block to fetch the high bits of data. These bits then combined with 'read_data_lo' are assigned to 'o_read_data' to facilitate the data retrieval operation from SRAM."
