    "block_comment": "The block of code calculates the number of characters in a 5-byte long input sequence (xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE). The function checks for whitespace in this input by comparing with string literals made of different numbers of spaces. If the input is all spaces, the function returns 1. If the last 8 bits (1 byte) of the sequence are not a space, it returns 5, or else, it continues to check the next 8 bits until it finds a non-space character or the sequence ends, incrementing the return value each time."
