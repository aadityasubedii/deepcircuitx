    "block_comment": "This block implements a write enable delay for a memory system. It utilizes an always block which is triggered by any changes in the input 'we_n'. This block then asserts the \"we_n_in\" signal after a delay designated by the constant 'BUS_DELAY', which simulates a delay that is sometimes necessary in real-world digital systems due to signal propagation times."
