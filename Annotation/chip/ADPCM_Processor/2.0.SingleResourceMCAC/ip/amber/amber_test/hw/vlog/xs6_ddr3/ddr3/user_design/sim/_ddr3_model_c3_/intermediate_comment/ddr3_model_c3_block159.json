    "block_comment": "This code block represents an instance of a dynamic always block which checks for a specific value at a particular address. Based on any update or changes in the bit 5 of the 'addr_in' input, it invokes the procedural block 'cmd_addr_timing_check' with 12 as a passed argument. The procedural block 'cmd_addr_timing_check' is most likely part of a timing check mechanism designed to ensure correct operation of the interface with regard to address lines."
