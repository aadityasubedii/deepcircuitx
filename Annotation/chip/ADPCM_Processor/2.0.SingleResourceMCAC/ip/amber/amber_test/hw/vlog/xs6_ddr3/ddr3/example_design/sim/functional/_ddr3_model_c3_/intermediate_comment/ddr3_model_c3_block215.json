    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a reset task used to initialize or reset the values of variables in a specific context related to a memory design. The task clears multiple variables, flags, signal values, counters, and status registers associated with data transmission and reception, memory bank management, mode selection, DLL settings, and power-down states. Strategies applied involve direct assignment of zero or 'unknown' values to these variables. A loop structure is employed to reset an array `wdqs_pos_cntr[]` of size 31."
