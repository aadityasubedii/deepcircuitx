Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for memory addressing in a system with either 16 or 8 data quanta (DQ) pins. It manipulates the row, bank, and column addresses of the memory based on pre-defined constants for address width, bank address width, and number of column bits. Depending on these constants and the memory address order ('ROW_BANK_COLUMN' or otherwise), different parts of the byte address for up to 6 separate ports are assigned to command row, bank or column address. When a width is less than its maximum size, it extends the signal with zeros using the 'allzero' array.
