    "block_comment": "This block of code is deploying an Output Buffer (OBUFT) for a DRAM memory controller. Specifically, it implements an OBUFT instance named 'iob_cas' that drives the DRAM memory's 'cas_n' control line. The logic signal 'ioi_cas' is used as input to the buffer, and 't_cas' is employed as an output-enable control. Thus, the buffer outputs the value of 'ioi_cas' to the 'cas_n' control line when 't_cas' is enabled."
