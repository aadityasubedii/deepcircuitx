    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_core module represents an ARM CPU core, implemented using Verilog RTL. It consists of multiple stages - fetch, decode, execute, memory and write-back, forming a RISC pipeline architecture with additional co-processor support. The module uses various inputs for clock, reset, testing, interrupt requests, and Wishbone bus interface data transfer. Internal signals ensure smooth stage transitions and handle operations like cache management, interrupt handling, and data transfer. Sub-modules are used to define the specific functionality of each pipeline stage, including fetch (`a25_fetch`), decode (`a25_decode`), execute (`a25_execute`), memory (`a25_mem`), write-back (`a25_write_back`), and a co-processor (`a25_coprocessor`), all interfaced via Wishbone protocol (`a25_wishbone`).\n"
