    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing command validation. Implemented in always block that is triggered at the positive edge of the clock signal (clk_i), it updates the cmd_vld signal. The cmd_vld signal gets updated with the delayed value of either the cmd_clk_en signal being high or both mode_load_pulse and first_load_pulse signals being high. The delay is determined by the TCQ time constant."
