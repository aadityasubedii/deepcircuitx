    "block_comment": "The block checks the validity of the current instruction. It asserts the 'instruction_valid' signal when the control state machine is in either the EXECUTE or PRE_FETCH_EXEC state or when the instruction execution is inactive and the control state machine is in one of a number of wait or process states (PC_STALL1, MEM_WAIT1, COPRO_WAIT, SWAP_WRITE, MULT_PROC1, or MTRANS_EXEC1). The implementation uses explicit signal assignments and logical OR operations to achieve this functionality."
