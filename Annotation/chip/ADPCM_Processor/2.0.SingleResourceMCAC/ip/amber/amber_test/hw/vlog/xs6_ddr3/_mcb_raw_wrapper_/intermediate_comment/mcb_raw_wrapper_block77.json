    "block_comment": "This block handles configuration and management of a data port in a memory interface generator module. When certain conditions in `C_PORT_CONFIG` are met, indicating the specified channel is \"B32\" and \"R32\", it either connects specific data signals directly from the port to the MIG module (if `C_PORT_ENABLE[2]` is active) or it zeroes out all these signals (if `C_PORT_ENABLE[2]` is not active). The functionality largely depends on the `C_PORT_ENABLE[2]`, serving as a gatekeeper for data flow between the port and MIG. Write operations are inactive, indicated by their respective signals forced to zero."
