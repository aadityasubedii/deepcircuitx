    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as an error detection mechanism in memory command operations. The code initiates checks whenever there is a change in command enable output (mcb_cmd_en_o), command address output (mcb_cmd_addr_o), command byte length output (mcb_cmd_bl_o), or the end address input (end_addr_i). If there is an attempt to access an address segment beyond the specified range (computed by command address, byte length, and data width), the block catches this as an error. It then displays an error message, sets an error flag (error_access_range), and stops the operation."
