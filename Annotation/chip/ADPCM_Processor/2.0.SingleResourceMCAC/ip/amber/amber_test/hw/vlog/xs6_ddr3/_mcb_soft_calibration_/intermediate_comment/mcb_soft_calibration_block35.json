    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the state transition within a specific context. This control is carried out based on the status of the signal named `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N`. When this signal is not active (as detected by `!MCB_RDY_BUSY_N`), the module remains in the `LDQS_CLK_N_TERM_WAIT` state. However, when `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` is active, the state changes to `LDQS_PIN_WRITE_P_TERM`."
