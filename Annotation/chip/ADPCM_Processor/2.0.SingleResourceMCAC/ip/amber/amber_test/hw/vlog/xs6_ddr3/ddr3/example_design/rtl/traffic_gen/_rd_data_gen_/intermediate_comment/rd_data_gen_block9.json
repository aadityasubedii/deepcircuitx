    "block_comment": "This block of code essentially serves as a user burst counter manager. Specifically, this block either initializes, sets, or decrements the `user_burst_cnt` based on certain conditions. At each rising edge of the clock signal, the counter is reset to zero if the least significant bit of the reset signal `rst_i` is high. If a `cmd_start` command is detected, the `user_burst_cnt` is set to a certain value depending on whether `bl_i` equals zero or not. If the signal `data_port_fifo_rdy` is high and `user_burst_cnt` is not zero, the `user_burst_cnt` is decremented by one, otherwise, it's set to zero."
