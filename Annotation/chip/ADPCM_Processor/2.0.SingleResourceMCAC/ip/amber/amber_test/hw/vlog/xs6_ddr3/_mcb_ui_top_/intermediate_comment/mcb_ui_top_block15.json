    "block_comment": "The block is an instance of \"mcb_raw_wrapper_inst\" which is used for memory control. This has inputs and outputs that control data read/write operations, refresh intervals, command instructions etc across various ports. It works by interfacing with the memory through decoded commands, and uses signals like sysclk_2x and sysclk_2x_180 as clock inputs for operations. There are multiple ports like p0, p2 etc each having read/write enable signals, clock signals, data signals etc. Signals like pll_lock, pll_ce_0, and pll_ce_90 indicate the lock status and clock enable signals for the PLLs. The flow of data is through the data (wr_data/rd_data) lines and is controlled by the enable line (wr_en/rd_en). Functions such as self-refresh are enabled through selfrefresh_enter and selfrefresh_mode, and status signals provide the current controller status."
