Module name: infrastructure. 

Module specification: 

The "infrastructure" module is a fundamental structure that manages the clocking configuration in a digital system. This module employs either differential or single-ended input clock types through an input buffer ('IBUFGDS' or 'IBUFG'). A Phase Locked Loop (PLL) defined by 'PLL_ADV' generates multiple targeted frequency outputs from the primary input clock after necessary division and multiplication. The base clocks are buffered using 'BUFG' and 'BUFGCE' modules, and it also handles the system reset functionality, applying the reset only when the PLL is locked. Connecting the PLL output clocks to the MCB interface, BUFPLL_MCB instance functions. The module generates a delayed clock 'pll_ce_90' in addition to the primary 'pll_ce_0'.

Input ports for this module include 'sys_clk_p', 'sys_clk_n', 'sys_clk', and 'sys_rst_i' which respectively represent the positive terminal of the differential system clock, the negative terminal, the single-ended system clock, and the system reset signal input. The output ports include 'clk0', 'rst0', 'async_rst', 'sysclk_2x', 'sysclk_2x_180', 'mcb_drp_clk', 'pll_ce_0', 'pll_ce_90', and 'pll_lock'. These ports represent the divided clock from PLL, synchronous and asynchronous reset signals, double frequency system clock and its 180-degree phase version, memory controller block clock, primary clock enable signal for PLL, phase-delayed version of `pll_ce_0`, and the locked status indicator of the PLL.

Internal signals like 'clk_2x_0', 'clk_2x_180', 'clk0_bufg', 'clk0_bufg_in', 'mcb_drp_clk_bufg_in', 'clkfbout_clkfbin', 'locked', 'rst0_sync_r', 'rst_tmp', 'powerup_pll_locked', 'syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked', 'sys_rst', 'bufpll_mcb_locked', and 'sys_clk_ibufg' have been used for various operational controls including output from the PLL, buffered clocks, rest signals, and lock status.

The code has distinct block structures employing the features of Verilog 'generate' construct and procedures encapsulated under 'always' blocks. Notably, these blocks include differential and single-ended input clock handling blocks, clock generation and buffering blocks, system reset handling blocks, and the primary clock enable generation blocks.
