Module-level comment: The cmd_prbs_gen module generates pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) of variable lengths using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) technique. It utilizes a clock signal 'clk_i' to synthesize the sequences which are managed by 'prbs_seed_init' and 'clk_en' signals for initial seed and clock enabling respectively. The output is passed through 'prbs_o'. Parameters 'PRBS_CMD' and 'PRBS_WIDTH' determine the functionality of logic blocks within, including an LFSR formation block and PRBS sequence logic block. The module contains an implemented base 2 logarithm function and caters to masking signals during address sequence generation.
