    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages a UART transmit state machine. Whenever a clock edge comes in and a transmit pulse is detected, it transitions to different states, originally from IDLE to START, then iterating through the DATA states, and finally to STOP states before resetting back to IDLE. At every state, data is shifted out onto the 'txd' line, with a START condition being a low signal and STOP conditions being high signals. Each DATA state corresponds to individual bits being transmitted from the 'tx_byte' to the 'txd' line sequencially. The transmission is halted if the transmit FIFO is empty or the 'uart0_cts_n_d' line indicates no clear to send."
