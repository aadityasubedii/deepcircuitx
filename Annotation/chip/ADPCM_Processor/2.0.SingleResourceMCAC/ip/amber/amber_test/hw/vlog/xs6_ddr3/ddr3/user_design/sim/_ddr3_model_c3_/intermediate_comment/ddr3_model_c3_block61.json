    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for a timing check whenever there is a positive edge in the 5th bit from the `dqs_in` input signal. This is achieved using the `always` block which gets triggered every time there's a positive edge on the input `dqs_in[4]`. The `dqs_pos_timing_check(4)` function is then called to perform the timing check on the bit."
