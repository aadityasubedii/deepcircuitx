    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents the implementation of a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) with a length of 20 which is used for Pseudorandom Binary Sequences (PRBS) generation. The LSFR works on the positive edge of the provided clock and has an initialization mode which sets the seed of the LFSR to a particular value. When enabled, the block updates the state of LFSR based on the previous state, with the 18th bit being a XOR result of the 20th and 17th bit."
