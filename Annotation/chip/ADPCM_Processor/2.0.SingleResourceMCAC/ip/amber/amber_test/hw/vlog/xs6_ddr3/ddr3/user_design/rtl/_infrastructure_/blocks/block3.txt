Comment: 
This block of code performs a reset operation on a register with systemic reset and external clock control. The 'assign' keyword indicates that there is a continuous assignment for the variable 'rst_tmp'. The system reset variable 'sys_rst' and the negated value of the 'syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked' are used for this operation. A bitwise OR operation between these two operands assigns a new value to 'rst_tmp'. Therefore, 'rst_tmp' will be set if a system reset is asserted or if the external clock is not locked, ensuring reset operation is robust to both system changes and external clock status.
