Comment: 
The block is a configuration and instantiation of a 2-bit OSERDES2 (Output Serializer/Deserializer) module named `ioi_cke_0`. The OSERDES2 outputs a serialized version of the input data onto its `OQ` output pin, utilizing the internal clock signal from `ioclk0`. Bypass mode for the initial flip-flop through the GCLK line is enabled and the internal flip-flops are set at a specific data rate. The output mode is set to Single-Ended, and the Serializer mode is set to Master. The training pattern is set to 15, that likely serves an error-checking purpose. The `t_cke` and `cke_90` signals are likely the input data that gets serialized. The `pll_ce_0` and `pll_lock` signals are likely used for enabling/disabling IO and indicating the phase-locked loop (PLL) is in a locked state, respectively.
