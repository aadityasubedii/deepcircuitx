The given block of code is responsible for controlling the output of the end frame signal (TxEndFrmOut) for transmission. Based on the control signal (CtrlMux), it either directly takes the end frame input signal (TxEndFrmIn) or a controlled end frame signal (TxCtrlEndFrm). When the CtrlMux signal is high, the TxCtrlEndFrm signal is selected, otherwise, the TxEndFrmIn signal is used. It operates as a multiplexer switch for end frame signals in a transmission circuit.
