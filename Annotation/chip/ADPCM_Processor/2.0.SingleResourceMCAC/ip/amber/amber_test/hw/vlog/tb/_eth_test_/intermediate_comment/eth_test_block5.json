    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a state machine for receiving data. The state machine transitions between five states: RX_IDLE, RX_PRE, RX_0, RX_1, RX_DONE based on certain conditions primarily associated with received data signals (mrxdv_i and mrxd_i). In the RX_IDLE state, initialization is done and when data is available it transitions to RX_PRE state. From RX_PRE, it checks for specific data and moves to RX_0. RX_0 and RX_1 states alternate between storing received data into an array (rxm) and updating the receive line register (rx_line_r). RX_DONE handles data extraction and file writing, logging received packets into a file, then cycles the packet count, if it matches a specific value, it's reset; else incremented. After final operation, state machine reverts to RX_IDLE state."
