    "block_comment": "This block checks if the received byte count is within the specified minimum and maximum length range. It achieves this via bit-wise AND operation between conditions. The 'RxByteCnt' represents the received byte count, while 'r_MinFL' and 'r_MaxFL' hold the values for the minimum and maximum length respectively. The result 'ReceivedLengthOK' indicates if the count is within the range."
