    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for the synchronization of signals, `cmd_rdy_o` and `tst_cmd_rdy_o`, with the rising edge of the input clock signal, `clk_i`. This signal activation happens a delay of `#TCQ` after the `clk_i` edge. This type of design is common in hardware designs for sequential and timing-sensitive operations."
