    "block_comment": "The block of code controls a module's transmission state. The transmission is allowed to proceed only when the receiving FIFO is not fully populated (signaled by '`~r_FullD`') and the module is ready to transmit (`WillTransmit_q2`), as suggested by a logical AND operation. Therefore, the '`Transmitting`' wire takes a high value when both conditions are met, otherwise it stays low, preventing data transmission."
