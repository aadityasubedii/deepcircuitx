Comment: 
This block of code initializes the system clock signal (`c3_sys_clk`) in the digital logic design. It sets the value of `c3_sys_clk` to zero at the initial step of the simulation using the `initial` keyword in Verilog. Please note that this block doesn't provide full information on how the system clock would behave in the entire sequence of events.
