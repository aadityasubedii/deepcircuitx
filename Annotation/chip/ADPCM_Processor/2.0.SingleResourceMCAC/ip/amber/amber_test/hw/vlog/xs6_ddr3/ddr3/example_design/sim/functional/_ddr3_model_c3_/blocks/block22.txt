This block takes negative edge of dqs_in[10] as the condition for the module 'dqs_neg_timing_check' to work on the element 10. Specifically, 'dqs_in' is an indexed array, and whenever there's a negative transition in the 10th element, 'dqs_neg_timing_check' is called with index 10 passed as parameter.
