    "block_comment": "This block is used for managing IO buffer and dual-Rank Phase registers for DDR type memory interfacing. Depending on the memory type (DDR, DDR2, or DDR3) and whether the in-terminal calibration is skipped, an IO buffer and IODRP2 (IO Dual-Rank Phase) registers are instantiated. The IOBUF and IODRP2 are responsible for handling input/output operations and dual-rank phase shifting respectively. The various signals provided to these modules are used to control and regulate data flow, clock signal, and other necessary operations for interfacing."
