    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for conditional data generation based on an addressing scheme and a data mode. On a positive edge of the clock signal, if 'fifo_rdy_i' is asserted or 'cmd_startC' is true, it inspects the input address 'addr_i' and the data mode 'data_mode_i'. If 'sel_w1gen_logic' is true, depending on values of 'addr_i' ranging from 0 to 35 (including all even numbers from 36 to 62) it assigns the output 'w1data' by calling either 'Data_Gen' or 'Data_GenW0' based on the value of 'data_mode_i'. If the address falls outside specified values, 'w1data' is set to zero."
