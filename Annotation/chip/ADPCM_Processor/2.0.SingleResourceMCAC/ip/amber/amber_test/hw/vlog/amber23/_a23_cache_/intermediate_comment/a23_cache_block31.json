    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for setting up the memory structure and control paths for a cache system in a digital circuit. Starting with generating multiple independent memory ways depending upon the number of ways the target system is designed to handle, it includes directives to select the type of on-chip memory, depending upon whether the FPGA is from Xilinx's Spartan 6, Virtex 6 family or a generic FPGA. Each memory way includes a tag memory and data memory, each with their specific width and address length, these memories are associated with different controls such as write enable and byte enable. The code further includes expressions for assigning logic conditions for tag writing, data writing and data hit, making sure the correct memory way is selected and written to under status of the cache state machine."
