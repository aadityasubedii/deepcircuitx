    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for triggering a timing check function, namely `dqs_pos_timing_check`, whenever a negative edge is detected on the 28th bit of the `dqs_in` signal. It does this by utilizing an `always` block which responds to this specific edge-triggered condition, invoking `dqs_pos_timing_check` subsequently."
