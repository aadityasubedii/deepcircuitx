    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages a state transition in a synchronous system. At each positive edge of UI_CLK, if the system reset RST is active, the state variable State_Start_DynCal_R1 is reset to 0. Otherwise, the current state, represented as State_Start_DynCal, is stored and maintained into State_Start_DynCal_R1."
