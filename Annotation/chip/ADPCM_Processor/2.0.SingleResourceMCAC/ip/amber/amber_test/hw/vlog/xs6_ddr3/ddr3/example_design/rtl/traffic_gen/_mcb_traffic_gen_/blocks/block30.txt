Comment: 
This block assigns the input signal `mcb_rd_empty_i` to the internal signal `mcb_rd_empty`. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements. This allows the signal `mcb_rd_empty` to track, in real-time, any changes to the `mcb_rd_empty_i` signal. This is generally used when one wants to propagate a signal or perform combinational logic in a hardware design.
