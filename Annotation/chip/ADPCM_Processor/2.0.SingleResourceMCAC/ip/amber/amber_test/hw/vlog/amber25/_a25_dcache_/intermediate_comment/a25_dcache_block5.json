    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block checks if data is hitting in more than one cache way during a clock cycle. It continuously monitors for positive edge trigger of the clock, adding up the values from all four data_hit_ways. If the sum is more than 1, it triggers an error message indicating a \"Hit in more than one cache ways\"."
