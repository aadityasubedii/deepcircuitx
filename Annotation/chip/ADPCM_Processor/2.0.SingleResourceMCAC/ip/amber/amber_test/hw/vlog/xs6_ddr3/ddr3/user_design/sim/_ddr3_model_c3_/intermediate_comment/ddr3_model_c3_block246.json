    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for setting the value of signal 'ck_n_in' at every positive edge of the clock 'ck_n'. The 'always' constructs sets up a continuous monitoring of the clock signal 'ck_n' and updates the value of 'ck_n_in' with the current value of 'ck_n' whenever the clock edge rises. The '#BUS_DELAY ck_n' signifies a delay in the assignment, identical to real-world signal propagation across a digital hardware bus."
