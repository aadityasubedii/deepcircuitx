    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a set of assignments for 5 separate signals in a digital system. Each signal is used to convey various types of information about the behaviour of the system. More specifically, this code block assigns 'b0 or false to all signals: `p3_error`, `p3_error_status`, `p3_cmp_data`, `p3_cmp_data_valid` and `p3_cmp_error`. Essentially, this block initializes or resets these signals to their default state, which in this context is `false`."
