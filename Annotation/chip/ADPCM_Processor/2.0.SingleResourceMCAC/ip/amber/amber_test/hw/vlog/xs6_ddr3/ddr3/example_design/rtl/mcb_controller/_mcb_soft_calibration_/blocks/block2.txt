Comment: 
The "DONE" block in the described Verilog RTL code signifies the termination or end state of a finite state machine (FSM). This state is transitioned to after the FSM completes its intended operation. The implementation specifically switches off two signals, "Pre_SYSRST" and "MCB_UICMDEN" by assigning them a binary '0'. At the same time, this block also sets the finite state machine to the "DONE" state, indicating that all the operations have been accomplished and the system can move to its resting state.
