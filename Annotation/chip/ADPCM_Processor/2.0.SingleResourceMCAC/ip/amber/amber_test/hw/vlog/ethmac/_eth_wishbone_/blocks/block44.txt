This Verilog block enables writing to a receive FIFO buffer under certain conditions. The `SetWriteRxDataToFifo` condition is designed to be `True` if any of the following holds: (1) A valid data word is received and ready for processing, not at the start of a frame, with reception window enabled and all receive byte count bits set(which implies a full byte arrived); (2) A valid start of frame data word is received, ready for processing and the least significant bit of the receive pointer indicates the current byte addressing space is reset; (3) The shift operation for data transfer will end soon and the last byte of the data word has entered the FIFO buffer with all byte count bits set. The use of bitwise AND (`&`) ensures all bits of Byte count/Pointer LSB must be `True` for the condition to activate.
