    "block_comment": "This block of code is a generate construct that acts as a conditional instantiation of sub-modules based on specific criteria. If these conditions are met: the data width (DWIDTH) equals 64, and the DATA_PATTERN is either \"DGEN_WALKING0\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", or \"DGEN_ALL\", a certain piece of subsequent code is executed labeled as \"WALKING_ONE_64_PATTERN\". This serves as a flexible mechanism to differentiate behavior of the modules based on configurations."
