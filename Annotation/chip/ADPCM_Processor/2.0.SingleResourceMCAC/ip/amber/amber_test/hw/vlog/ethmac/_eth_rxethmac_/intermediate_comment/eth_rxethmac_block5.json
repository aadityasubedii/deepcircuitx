    "block_comment": "The block performs the assignment operation for the \"GenerateRxStartFrm\" signal. It is implemented using a combination of bitwise AND and logical OR operations on various input signals and subsets of an array. Specifically, it checks the first element of the 'StateData' array, and the condition where 'ByteCntEq1' is true and 'DlyCrcEn' is false or where 'DlyCrcCnt' is equal to hexadecimal '3' when 'DlyCrcEn' is true."
