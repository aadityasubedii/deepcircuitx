    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls a synchronous reset operation for the `BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync1` signal. The block is triggered at a positive edge of either the `MTxClk` clock signal or the `Reset` signal. If the `Reset` signal is high, the `BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync1` is set to 0 with a delay defined by `Tp`; else, on the positive edge of `MTxClk`, `BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync1` is set to the value of `BlockingTxStatusWrite` with a delay defined by `Tp`."
