    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a part of a transmit FIFO in a UART controller. During a negative edge of the reset signal, the write pointer of the transmit FIFO is reset to 0. When not in loopback mode, the block writes the transmitted data (txd) into the FIFO if it is not full and increments the write pointer; if FIFO is full, it displays a warning message for the overflow. In loopback mode, when the receive state is '2' and the bit start flag is high, the received byte (rx_byte) is written into the FIFO and the write pointer increments as well."
