Comment: 
This block of code is meant to deal with signal retention by keeping track of the current master and the signal hold statuses for two different masters (`m0` and `m1`). On each positive edge of the `i_wb_clk` clock signal, it updates the values of `current_master_r`, `m0_wb_hold_r`, and `m1_wb_hold_r` which hold the values of `current_master`, and the hold status of `m0` and `m1`. The hold status is determined by the asserted wishbone strobes `i_m0_wb_stb` and `i_m1_wb_stb` in the absence of respective acknowledgement signals `o_m0_wb_ack` and `o_m1_wb_ack`.
