Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for generating the acknowledge signal for a write or read operation in a wishbone protocol setting. It works by ANDing the strobe signal (i_wb_stb) with the result of the OR operation between the start_write and read_ack signals. This effectively means that an acknowledge signal will be produced when the transaction is either a fresh write operation, or there is a successful read acknowledgement, and the strobe signal is high.
