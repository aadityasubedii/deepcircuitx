    "block_comment": "The block increments an address counter upon every occurrence of a rising edge clock signal. In its implementation, the block waits for the rising edge (positive-edge) of the input clock signal ('clk_i'). When a rising edge is detected, it asynchronously dismisses the next value of the 'addr_counts_next_r' variable (with a time delay specified by #TCQ) by adding the 'INC_COUNTS' constant to the current 'addr_counts'."
