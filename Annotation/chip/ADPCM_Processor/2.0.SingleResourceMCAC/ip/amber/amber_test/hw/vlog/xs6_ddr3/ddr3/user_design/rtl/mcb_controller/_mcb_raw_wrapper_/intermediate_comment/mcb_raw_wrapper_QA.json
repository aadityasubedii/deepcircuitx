It handles the interface between the user logic and the DRAM memory, supporting various DRAM types (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, LPDDR) and configurations. The module manages address and data signals, command generation, and I/O operations. It includes features such as data masking, differential signaling for DQS, and configurable port widths. The wrapper also incorporates delay and calibration logic for proper timing of memory operations, and supports different port configurations for flexibility in system design."
