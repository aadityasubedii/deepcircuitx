Comment: 
The provided block of Verilog RTL code manages the write pointer for a clock queue. Upon a positive edge occurrence on the read clock, it is programmed to reset the write pointer and gray code based on a reset signal. When there is no reset, and if write enable signal is active, it will increment the write pointer. In the same cycle, it also updates the write gray code with the next gray code.
