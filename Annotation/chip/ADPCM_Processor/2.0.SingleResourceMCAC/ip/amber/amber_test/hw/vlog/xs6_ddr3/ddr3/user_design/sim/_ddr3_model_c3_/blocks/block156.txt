This block of code is responsible for triggering an address timing check whenever there is a change in the ninth bit of the input address (addr_in[]). The block executes the function 'cmd_addr_timing_check' using '15' as a parameter each time there is an edge (either rising or falling) in 'addr_in[8]'.
