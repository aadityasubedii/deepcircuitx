The block disables the MIG P4 command and resets the addresses. In terms of implementation, the command enable signal (mig_p4_cmd_en) is assigned a '0' which indicates that it is turned off. The rank address (mig_p4_cmd_ra), bank address (mig_p4_cmd_ba), and the column address (mig_p4_cmd_ca) are all reset to '0'.
