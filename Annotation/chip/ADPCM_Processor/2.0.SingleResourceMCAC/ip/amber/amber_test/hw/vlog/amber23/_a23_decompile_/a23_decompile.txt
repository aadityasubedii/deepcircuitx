Module-level comment: 
/*
This module decompiles ARM-like instructions into human-readable assembly code for debugging.
It decodes incoming instructions, extracts relevant fields (opcodes, registers, immediates),
and formats them into assembly-like syntax. The module handles various instruction types,
conditions, and special cases. Decompiled instructions and debug information are written to
a file specified by A23_DECOMPILE_FILE. The module operates in real-time alongside the
processor core, providing instruction-by-instruction decoding and logging.
