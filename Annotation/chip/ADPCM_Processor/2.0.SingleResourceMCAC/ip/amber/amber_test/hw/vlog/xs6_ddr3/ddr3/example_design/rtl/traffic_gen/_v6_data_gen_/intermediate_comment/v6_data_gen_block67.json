    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating three registers: data_mode_rr_a, data_mode_rr_b, and data_mode_rr_c. It achieves this function by making use of the clock signal edge; on every positive edge of the clock (clk_i), it takes the input data_mode_i and after a delay (#TCQ), assigns this value to the three registers."
