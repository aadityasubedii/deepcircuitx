This block checks the validity of an instruction. It assigns 'instruction_valid' based on the current 'control_state'. If the 'control_state' is in 'EXECUTE' or 'PRE_FETCH_EXEC', 'instruction_valid' will be true. Conversely, if an instruction is not being executed and 'control_state' is in any of the other mentioned states ('PC_STALL1', 'MEM_WAIT1', etc.), 'instruction_valid' will also be set to true. This block ensures that the system is always ready to process valid instructions regardless of the current control state.
