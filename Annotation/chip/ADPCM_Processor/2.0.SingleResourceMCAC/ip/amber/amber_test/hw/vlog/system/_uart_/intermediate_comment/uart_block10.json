    "block_comment": "The given block of code handles the acknowledgments for read operations on a wishbone interface. It does this by logically combining three signals - i_wb_stb (indicating a valid cycle), negated i_wb_we (indicating a read operation as opposed to a write), and o_wb_ack (indicating that the slave has acknowledged the cycle). The resulting \"wb_read_ack\" signal will only be high when these conditions are true, i.e., during a successful read operation acknowledged by the slave."
