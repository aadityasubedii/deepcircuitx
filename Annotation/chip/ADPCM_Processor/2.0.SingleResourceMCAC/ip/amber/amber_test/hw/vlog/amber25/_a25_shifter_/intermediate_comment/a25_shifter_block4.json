    "block_comment": "The block manages an arithmetic right shift (ASR) operation. It performs binary division or shift-right operations based on the shift amount indicated by `i_shift_amount[1:0]`. If `i_shift_imm_zero` is true, it extends the sign bit of `i_in[31]` through the entire width of `asr_out`. If not, the LSB of `i_in` and bits from index 30 to either 1, 2, or 3 are used, extending the sign bit of `i_in[31]` for rest of bits, with `i_carry_in` becoming the MSB if the shift amount is zero."
