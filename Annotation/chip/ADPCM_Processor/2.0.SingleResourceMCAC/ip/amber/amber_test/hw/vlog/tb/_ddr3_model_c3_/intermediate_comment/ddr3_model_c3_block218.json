    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for the task of erasing banks in memory. The block first defines `banks` as an input and then uses that as a reference in a for-loop to check for the presence of any memory banks tagged to be erased, which is indicated by a equaling to 1'b1. In the presence of any such bank, the function then initiates the process of erasing, by first closing the file descriptor associated with said bank, followed by opening a new bank file. In scenarios where no maximum memory is defined, the function proceeds to initiate a memory clearance procedure using a second and then a third for-loop to go through all the memory addresses, replacing them with 'bx and then iterating to decrease the count of memory used, effectively clearing the specified memory banks."
