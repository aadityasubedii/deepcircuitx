    "block_comment": "This block is a state machine handler in the synchronous digital design. At every rising edge of the input clock, it checks the reset signal. If the reset signal is high, it sets the 'current_state' to a predefined initial state ('4'b0001'). If the reset signal is not asserted, it advances the 'current_state' to the 'next_state'. The transition to the new state is controlled by the delay defined by the constant 'TCQ'."
