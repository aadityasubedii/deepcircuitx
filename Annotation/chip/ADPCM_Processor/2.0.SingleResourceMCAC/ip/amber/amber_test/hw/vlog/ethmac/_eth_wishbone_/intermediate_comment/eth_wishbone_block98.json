    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for generating a pulse signal, 'TxDonePulse', whenever the transmission of data is completed. The implementation uses a bitwise AND operation between the current write back status 'TxDone_wb' and the negated previous state 'TxDone_wb_q'. The result is a pulse that is generated when 'TxDone_wb' is high (indicating a recently completed data transmission) and 'TxDone_wb_q' is low (indicating that the completion had not been registered in the previous state)."
