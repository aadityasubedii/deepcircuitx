    "block_comment": "The given block assigns the next state of `firq_not_user_mode_nxt` dependent on the comparison of `status_bits_mode_nxt` with `FIRQ`. The direct assignment operator ('=') is used to assign the Boolean value of the expression (`status_bits_mode_nxt == FIRQ`) to the variable `firq_not_user_mode_nxt`. This assignment will always happen as soon as the right-hand-side expression is evaluated. The expression `status_bits_mode_nxt == FIRQ` compares the current status mode to a 'fast interrupt request' (FIRQ) and the result is stored in `firq_not_user_mode_nxt` in the next state."
