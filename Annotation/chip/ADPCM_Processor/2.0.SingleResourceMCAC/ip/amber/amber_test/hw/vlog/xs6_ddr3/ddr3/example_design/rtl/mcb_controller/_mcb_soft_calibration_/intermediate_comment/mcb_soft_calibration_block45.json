    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code represents a state machine handling system states based on input and control conditions. Conditionally, if the 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' signal is inactive, it retains the 'WAIT4' state. If 'ZIO_IN' is inactive or 'N_Term' equals to all ones condition met, it changes the state to 'SKEW' only when 'PNSKEW' is active, and otherwise shifts to 'WAIT_FOR_START_BROADCAST' state. If neither of these conditions are met, the system state transitions to an 'INC_NTERM' state."
