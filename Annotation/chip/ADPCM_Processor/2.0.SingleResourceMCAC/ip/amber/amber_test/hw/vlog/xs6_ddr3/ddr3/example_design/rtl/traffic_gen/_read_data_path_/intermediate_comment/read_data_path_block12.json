    "block_comment": "This Block is a flip-flop component, with error notification. It gets triggered on the positive edge of the input clock signal (`clk_i`). When the second bit of the input reset signal (`rst_i[1]`) or the manual error clear signal is high, both the registered error byte (`error_byte_r1`) and the data error flag (`data_error`) are cleared. In other circumstances, the error byte receives the current error byte signal, and the data error flag is high when any bit in the registered error byte is high. If there is a data error, it will display a notification providing the expected data, received data and the time of error occurrence."
