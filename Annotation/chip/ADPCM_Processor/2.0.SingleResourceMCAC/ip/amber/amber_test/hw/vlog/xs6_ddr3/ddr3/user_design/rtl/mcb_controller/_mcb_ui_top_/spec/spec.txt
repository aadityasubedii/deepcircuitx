Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) with support for multiple ports and AXI interfaces. It manages clock signals, arbitration between ports, and AXI-to-MCB protocol conversion. The module has configurable parameters for memory type, port configuration, and arbitration schemes. Key input ports include clock and reset signals, port-specific control signals for up to 6 ports, calibration and UI signals, and AXI interface signals. Output ports include buffered clock signals, port-specific status signals, memory interface signals for DRAM control, calibration and UI output signals, and AXI interface output signals. Internal signals handle interfacing between AXI ports and the memory controller, including arbitration, command, write, and read operations for each port. The module is divided into several sections: parameter declarations, input/output port
