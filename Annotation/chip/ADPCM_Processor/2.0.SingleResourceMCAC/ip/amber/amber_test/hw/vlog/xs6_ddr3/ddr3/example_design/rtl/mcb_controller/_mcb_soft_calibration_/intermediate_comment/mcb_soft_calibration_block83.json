    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the state of the CKE_Train signal. Initially, when a reset condition (RST) is detected, it forces the signal 'CKE_Train' to a low state. In the absence of a reset condition, 'CKE_Train' is controlled based on state transitions and conditions associated with the 'MCB_UODONECAL' signal and 'WAIT_200us_COUNTER'. If the system's state is 'WAIT_FOR_UODONE' and 'MCB_UODONECAL' is high, 'CKE_Train' is set low, if the counter exceeds a specific threshold and 'MCB_UODONECAL' is low, then 'CKE_Train' is set high, otherwise, it remains in a low state."
