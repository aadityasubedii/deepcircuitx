Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is initializing a Block Random Access Memory (RAMB) on a Spartan6 FPGA. It details the hardware configurations for a RAMB16BWER unit, which functions as the dual-port memory block. Each parameter reflects some customization or feature specification for the block RAM. The parameters DATA_WIDTH_A and DATA_WIDTH_B set the data width of the two RAM ports to 36-bits respectively. The block disables output registers by setting DOA_REG and DOB_REG to 0. Reset options for the RAM are set to be synchronous, and the block RAM is not reset upon power-up by setting EN_RSTRAM_A and EN_RSTRAM_B to "FALSE". The SRVAL_A, SRVAL_B, INIT_A, and INIT_B establish initial values and reset state for the memory content. The device specified is a SPARTAN6 FPGA, and the write mode is set to "WRITE_FIRST" for both ports.
