    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to perform a timing check on the seventh bit of the DQS input signal whenever a negative edge is encountered. This is achieved by calling the described 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function on this specified bit during the negative edge of 'dqs_in[6]', which enables the system to assess the timing behaviour of this particular part of the DQS signal."
