    "module": "Module-level comment: This is the eth_crc module, implementing Ethernet CRC calculation for error-checking digital data. It utilizes a clock for synchronization, and uses signals Reset and Initialize to reset the operating conditions. The incoming 4-bit data (Data) undergoes CRC validation, enabled by an Enable signal. Internally, CrcNext holds intermediate CRC results, performing bitwise XOR calculations in response to Enable. The 32-bit Crc output represents the CRC of the Data, and CrcError indicates a mismatch with a predefined value. The functionality relies on effective use of XOR operations, synchronous timing, and state control provided by Reset, Initialize and Enable signals."
