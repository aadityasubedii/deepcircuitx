    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is mainly used for assigning values to output variables depending on the currently active slave. It is set to operate on output variables when a particular slave (slave 7) is chosen based on the 'current_slave' condition. Specifically, it maps 'master_adr' to 'o_s7_wb_adr', 'master_wdat' to 'o_s7_wb_dat', and 'master_sel' to 'o_s7_wb_sel'. Furthermore, it maps the 'master_we', 'master_cyc', and 'master_stb' to respective output variables, only when 'current_slave' is 7, otherwise, it assigns them a zero."
