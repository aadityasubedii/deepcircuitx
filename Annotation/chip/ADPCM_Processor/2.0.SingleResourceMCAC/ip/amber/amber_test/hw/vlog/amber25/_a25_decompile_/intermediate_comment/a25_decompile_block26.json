    "block_comment": "These blocks of code are used to classify instructions (coded as binary strings) and to assign these instructions human-readable names based on their classifications. Specifically, the first block determines the type of the instruction (`itype`) by comparing parts of the `execute_instruction` string to predefined binary patterns, representing various instruction types (SWAP, MULT, REGOP, TRANS, MTRANS, BRANCH, CODTRANS, COREGOP, CORTRANS, SWI). The second block of code then translates `itype` into human-friendly names with the string format."
