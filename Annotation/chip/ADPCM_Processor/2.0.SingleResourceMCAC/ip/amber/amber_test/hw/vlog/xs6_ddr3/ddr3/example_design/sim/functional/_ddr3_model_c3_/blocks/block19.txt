This block of code performs a timing check at the negative edge of the 'dqs_in' signal at index 13. It accomplishes this through the usage of the 'always' control flow statement, which triggers the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function whenever there's a negative transition on the 14th bit of the 'dqs_in' signal.
