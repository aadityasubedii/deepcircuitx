The module handles various instruction types,\nconditions, and special cases. Decompiled instructions and debug information are written to\na file specified by A23_DECOMPILE_FILE. The module operates in real-time alongside the\nprocessor core, providing instruction-by-instruction decoding and logging.\n*/"
