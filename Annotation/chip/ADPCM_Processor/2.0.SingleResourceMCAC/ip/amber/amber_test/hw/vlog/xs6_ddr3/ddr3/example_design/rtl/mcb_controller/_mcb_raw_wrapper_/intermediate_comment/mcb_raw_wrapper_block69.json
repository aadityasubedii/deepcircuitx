    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a conditional statement that sets values for several memory interface variables depending on the state of `C_PORT_ENABLE[0]`. If `C_PORT_ENABLE[0]` is enabled (1), the memory interface variable `mig_p0_xxx` is assigned values from `p0_xxx` variables where `xxx` represents various command attributes like arbitration enable, command clock, enable, row address, bank address, column address, burst length, instruction and status of command memory. If `C_PORT_ENABLE[0]` is not enabled (0), all memory interface variables are set to 0, effectively disabling all operations and instructions."
