Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for assigning values to `LatchByte1_d2` and `LatchByte0_d2`. It sets these latch byte registers based on three conditions: if operation is in progress (`InProgress` being TRUE), a write operation is not occurring (`WriteOp` being FALSE), and for `LatchByte1_d2` and `LatchByte0_d2`, the `BitCounter` equals 'h37 and 'h3F respectively. These assignments seem to relate to some data buffering process, conditioning latchings on operational states and specific bit count values.
