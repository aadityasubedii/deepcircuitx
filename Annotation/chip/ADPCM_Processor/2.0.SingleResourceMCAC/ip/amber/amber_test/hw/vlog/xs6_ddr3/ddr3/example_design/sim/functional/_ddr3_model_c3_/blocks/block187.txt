Comment: 
The provided Verilog code block is responsible for calling the `dqs_odd_receiver` function whenever there is a positive edge detected on the 5th bit of `dqs_odd` signal. The `always` keyword indicates that this block is set to constantly monitor the state changes to the 5th bit of the `dqs_odd` signal and act correspondingly. Consequently, with every positive edge (transition from 0 to 1), the `dqs_odd_receiver` function with an input argument of 4 is invoked.
