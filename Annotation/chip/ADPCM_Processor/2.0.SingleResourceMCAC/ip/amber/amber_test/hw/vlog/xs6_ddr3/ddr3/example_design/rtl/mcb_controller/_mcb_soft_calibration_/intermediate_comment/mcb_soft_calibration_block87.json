    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a synchronizer that updates the status of 'DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL' at every rising edge of 'UI_CLK'. This status update is controlled by conditions: whether the 'DQS_DELAY_INITIAL' is not equal to 0, or the current 'STATE' equals DONE, and if 'MCB_UODONECAL' is true. So, the 'DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL' accumulates the condition of having finished both software and hardware calibrations."
