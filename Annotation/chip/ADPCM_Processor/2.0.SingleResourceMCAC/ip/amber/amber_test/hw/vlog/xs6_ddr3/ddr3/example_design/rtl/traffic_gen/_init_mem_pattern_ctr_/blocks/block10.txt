This block of code is part of a clocked sequential circuit that updates register values on every positive edge of the input clock. The registers `mcb_init_done_reg1` and `mcb_init_done_reg` are being updated in sequence, where `mcb_init_done_reg1` takes the current input `mcb_init_done_i` and `mcb_init_done_reg` is updated with the value of `mcb_init_done_reg1` after one clock cycle. So essentially, this block forms a two-stage pipeline, which helps in synchronizing the input with the system clock's rate.
