    "block_comment": "This block of code performs error-checking for invalid write commands to port 4 in a system. When certain conditions are satisfied, including \"W32\" being set in the upper half of the C_PORT_CONFIG variable and an active command enable signal (p4_cmd_en), but a mismatch in the write command structure as denoted by the p4_cmd_instr signal (signifying that an unwarranted read action might be being attempted), an error message is displayed and operation is halted by forcefully ending the simulation. This is done using conditional if and if-else statements in the hardware description language (Verilog)."
