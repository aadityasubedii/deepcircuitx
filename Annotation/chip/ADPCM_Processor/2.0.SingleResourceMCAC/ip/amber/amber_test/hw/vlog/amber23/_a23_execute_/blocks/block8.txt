Line number: 
[478, 478]
Comment: 
This line assigns the input register "address_r" to the output wire "o_address". This single line of code allows data from the internal circuitry to be passed to external components. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment and the resulting output is updated whenever there's a change in the value of 'address_r'. The output 'o_address' will have the same value as that of 'address_r'. This is a fundamental feature in most digital designs which allows for data management within the circuit.
