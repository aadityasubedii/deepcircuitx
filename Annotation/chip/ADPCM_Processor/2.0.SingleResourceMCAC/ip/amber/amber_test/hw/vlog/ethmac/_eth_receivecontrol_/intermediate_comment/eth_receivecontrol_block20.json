    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the write address for received pause frames in a network device. The operation is governed by the edge of the Master Receive Clock (MRxClk) or a high value on the Receive Reset (RxReset). When the reset is active, or when the ReceiveEnd signal is high, the ReceivedPauseFrmWAddr flag is set to low, disabling the writing to the appropriate address. On the other hand, if the byte count equals to 16 and the TypeLength, OpCode, and Address validations are successful, the ReceivedPauseFrmWAddr flag is set to high, enabling write operation to the pause frame address."
