    "module": "Module-level comment: The afifo module implements a parameterized Asynchronous FIFO memory, storing incoming data under the control of write clock and enable signal and retrieving it under the control of read clock and enable signal. The module uses separately clocked, Gray-encoded pointers for write and read modules to avoid synchronization issues. It includes separate sync blocks for read and write, memory storage, and computation of next Gray-encoded pointers. Several status signals - full, empty, almost_full are generated to reflect the current status of the FIFO buffer."
