    "block_comment": "This block generates a specific data pattern for a system with 112 data query (DQ) pins. The block checks if the number of DQ pins is 112 and if the DATA_PATTERN parameters match certain values (\"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\"). If these conditions are met, the block commands an 'always' procedural block to be enacted at the positive edge of an incoming clock signal (`posedge clk_i`), thus setting a specific data pattern."
