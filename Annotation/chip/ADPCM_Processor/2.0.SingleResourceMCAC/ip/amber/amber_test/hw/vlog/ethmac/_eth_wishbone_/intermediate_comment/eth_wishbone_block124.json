    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the triggering of a signal to read transmission data from memory. The operation is synchronous with either the read attempt (WB_CLK_I) or resetting operation (Reset). If a reset signal is encountered, the 'ReadTxDataFromMemory' bit will be set to 0 with a delay (Tp). Similarly, in the presence of any of the three conditions - zero transmission length (TxLengthEq0), transmission abort (TxAbortPulse), or transmission retry (TxRetryPulse) - the 'ReadTxDataFromMemory' bit will be set to a delayed 0. Whereas, if the 'SetReadTxDataFromMemory' flag is found, 'ReadTxDataFromMemory' bit will be set to a delayed 1."
