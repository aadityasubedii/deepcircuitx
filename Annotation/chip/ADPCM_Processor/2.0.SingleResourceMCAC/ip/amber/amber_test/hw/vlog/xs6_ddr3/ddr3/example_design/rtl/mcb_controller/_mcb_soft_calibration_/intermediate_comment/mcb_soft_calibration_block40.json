    "block_comment": "This block of code is serving as a state machine handling memory controller buffer (MCB) operations. It primarily operates by gauging the 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N' and 'First_In_Term_Done' signals, before determining its Finit-State-Machine (FSM) next state. When 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N' is not set, the FSM remains in a 'WAIT5' state; whereas, when it is set with 'First_In_Term_Done', an additional check for the 'MCB_UOREFRSHFLAG' is performed. If it's set, it updates 'MCB_UIDRPUPDATE', compares 'N_Term' and 'N_Term_Prev' for dissimilarity before deciding next state, and transitions to either 'BROADCAST_NTERM' when dissimilar or 'OFF_RZQ_PTERM' when identical. If 'MCB_UOREFRSHFLAG' is unset, FSM returns to 'WAIT5'. Finally, in absence of 'First_In_Term_Done', 'N_Term_Prev' gets updated with 'N_Term' and 'STATE' transitions to 'BROADCAST_NTERM'."
