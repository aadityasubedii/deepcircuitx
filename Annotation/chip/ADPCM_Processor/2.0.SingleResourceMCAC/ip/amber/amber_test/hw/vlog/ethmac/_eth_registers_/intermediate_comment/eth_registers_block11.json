    "block_comment": "The function of this block is for synchronous reset operation with debouncing. This Verilog block describes a flip-flop that captures the state of the `ResetRxCIrq_sync1` signal at the positive edge of `RxClk` (Receive Clock) or the `Reset` signal, thus serves as a 2nd stage synchronizer. When a Reset signal is detected, the system will reset the `ResetRxCIrq_sync2` output signal. Apart from that, the system will capture the state of `ResetRxCIrq_sync1` synchronously with the `RxClk` or `Reset` signal, which helps in handling any possible metastability issues of inputs that are not aligned with this clock signal."
