This block of code is used to perform a positive edge check for the data strobe signal (DQS). It utilizes a procedural block in Verilog, represented by the keyword 'always', which triggers at every positive edge transition of the 14th bit of the DQS input signal. This, in turn, invokes the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function with parameter 13, further evaluating the DQS signal timing parameters.
