    "spec": "Module name: a23_coprocessor\n\nModule specification: The a23_coprocessor is a module that functions as a co-processor in a Verilog RTL code, specifically managing cache control, and fault handling. It takes multiple inputs concerning instructions, operations, and addresses, along with clock and fault information. Some of its significant inputs include i_clk (clock input), i_copro_opcode1 and i_copro_opcode2 (co-processor operation codes inputs), i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, i_copro_num (register numbers inputs), i_copro_operation (defines the operation to perform), i_copro_write_data (data to be written to the co-processor), i_fault (fault signal input to handle exceptions or disruptions), i_fault_status (fault status signal), and i_fault_address (fault address signal). Outputs from this module include o_copro_read_data (data read by the co-processor), o_cache_enable (cache enabling signal), o_cache_flush (cache flush state), and o_cacheable_area (cacheable area information). \n\nInternally, the module uses several signals to control caches and faults. These include cache_control (controls the cache operation), cacheable_area (keeping track of cacheable area), updateable_area (maintaining the updatable area), disruptive_area (representing disruptive area of the system), fault_status (holding and updating the fault status), fault_address (representing fault address), and copro15_reg1_write (denoting the write operation on register 1 of co-processor 15).\n\nThe code can be broken down into several sections including signal assignments, input handling and conditional logic, debugging and operational information display, and default signal handling. These blocks manage various areas like the cache operation, updateable and disruptive areas, debugging and fault handling, and the operational behavior of the co-processor. This module is structured to reflect detailed and meticulous design considerations of a hardware co-processor.",

It takes multiple inputs concerning instructions, operations, and addresses, along with clock and fault information. Some of its significant inputs include i_clk (clock input), i_copro_opcode1 and i_copro_opcode2 (co-processor operation codes inputs), i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, i_copro_num (register numbers inputs), i_copro_operation (defines the operation to perform), i_copro_write_data (data to be written to the co-processor), i_fault (fault signal input to handle exceptions or disruptions), i_fault_status (fault status signal), and i_fault_address (fault address signal). Outputs from this module include o_copro_read_data (data read by the co-processor), o_cache_enable (cache enabling signal), o_cache_flush (cache flush state), and o_cacheable_area (cacheable area information). \n\nInternally, the module uses several signals to control caches and faults. These include cache_control (controls the cache operation), cacheable_area (keeping track of cacheable area), updateable_area (maintaining the updatable area), disruptive_area (representing disruptive area of the system), fault_status (holding and updating the fault status), fault_address (representing fault address), and copro15_reg1_write (denoting the write operation on register 1 of co-processor 15).\n\nThe code can be broken down into several sections including signal assignments, input handling and conditional logic, debugging and operational information display, and default signal handling. These blocks manage various areas like the cache operation, updateable and disruptive areas, debugging and fault handling, and the operational behavior of the co-processor. This module is structured to reflect detailed and meticulous design considerations of a hardware co-processor."
