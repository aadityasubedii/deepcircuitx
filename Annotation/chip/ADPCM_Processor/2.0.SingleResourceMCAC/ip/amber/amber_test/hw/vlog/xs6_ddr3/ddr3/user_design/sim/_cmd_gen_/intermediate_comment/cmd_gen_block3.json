    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code serves as an error detection mechanism for a specific condition. It checks if the burst length designated by the variable 'bl_out' exceeds 2 and if the FPGA family is 'VIRTEX6'. If both conditions are met, the code outputs an error message signaling that the burst length is invalid and then halts the simulation. Hence, it safeguards against potentially invalid operations in this family of FPGA devices."
