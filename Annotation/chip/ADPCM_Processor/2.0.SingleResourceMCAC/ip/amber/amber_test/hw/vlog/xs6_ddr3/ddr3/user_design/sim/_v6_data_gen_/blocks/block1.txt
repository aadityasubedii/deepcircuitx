This block generates a pseudo random bit sequence (PRBS) for data testing. The implemented module `data_prbs_gen` is parameterized with PRBS width, seed width, and eye test parameters. Called with a set of inputs - clock, reset, clock enable, initial seeds, seed control signal, and data source for seed - the module generates a pseudo-random bit sequence output `prbs_o`. Bit selection from `m_addr_i` is done to get the seed value, indicating careful use of bit manipulation to generate the PRBS.
