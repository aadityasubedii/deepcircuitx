This block is a sequential logic for syncing and signal conditioning. This particular block uses a gated D flip-flop to synchronize the signal 'ShiftEnded' to the WB_CLK_I clock. On a positive edge of either WB_CLK_I or Reset, the 'ShiftEndedSync3' output is controlled. If Reset is asserted, 'ShiftEndedSync3' is reset asynchronously. While 'ShiftEndedSync1' is high and 'ShiftEndedSync2' is low, 'ShiftEndedSync3' would set to high. If 'ShiftEnded' signal is high, 'ShiftEndedSync3' would be cleared under the WB_CLK_I clock.
