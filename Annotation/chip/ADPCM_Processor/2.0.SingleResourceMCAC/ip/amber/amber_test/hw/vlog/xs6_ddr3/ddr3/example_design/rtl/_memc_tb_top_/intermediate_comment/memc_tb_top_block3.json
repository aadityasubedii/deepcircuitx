    "block_comment": "This block handles command field mapping for port 4 based on the port enable state and operating mode. If port 4 is enabled and in read mode, it checks which other ports are enabled and in write mode and maps the command fields from the first such port it finds to port 4. If no such port is found, or if port 4 is in write mode, it maps port 4's own command fields to itself. This is achieved through a series of if-else statements which check the state and mode of each port and assigns values for command enable signal, command instruction signal, command address signal, burst length signal, and write enable signal accordingly."
