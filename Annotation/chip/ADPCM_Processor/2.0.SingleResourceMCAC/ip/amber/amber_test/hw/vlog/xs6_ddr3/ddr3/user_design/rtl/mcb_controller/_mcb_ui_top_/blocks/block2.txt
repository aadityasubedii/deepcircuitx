This block of Verilog code defines a memory controller for a Spartan6 FPGA, and synchronizes the calibration status of the controller. The implemented module 'mcb_ui_top_synch' achieves synchronization using the given clock signal and a done_cal signal, outputting the signal calib_done_synch. Following this, is the instantiation of the 'axi_mcb' module for Memory Controller Block (MCB) which interfaces with the AXI bus protocols. This block is configured for data widths, address widths, arbitration and coherency settings specific to the Spartan6 family. The large complex block of code afterwards is the complete interface definition of the axi and MCB standards. The AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) bus protocol is defined along with the specific read and write signals and status signals for the MCB. The last signal, calib_done_synch, is used to report the calibration status of the MCB.
