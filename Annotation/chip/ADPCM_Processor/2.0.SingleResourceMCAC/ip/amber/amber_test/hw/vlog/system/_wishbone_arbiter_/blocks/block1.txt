Comment: 
The block is responsible for assigning appropriate signals to the master outputs of a wishbone bus system. First, `o_m1_wb_dat` is assigned the value of `master_rdat`, effectively outputting the read data from the master. Then, `o_m1_wb_ack` and `o_m1_wb_err`, which represent acknowledgment and error signals respectively, are conditionally assigned depending upon the `current_master` value. If `current_master` holds true, they are assigned `master_ack` and `master_err` respectively, else a default value of '0' is set.
