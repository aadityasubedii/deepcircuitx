Comment: 
This block is responsible for handling the case when the memory burst length is equal to 8. It achieves this by repositioning and updating four portions of the received data block 'w1data'. The repositioning is done by shifting chunks of the data block relative to the number of Data-Query (DQ) Pins (NUM_DQ_PINS) and memory clock period with a delay of #TCQ. The updated values are concatenated back into the original positions.
