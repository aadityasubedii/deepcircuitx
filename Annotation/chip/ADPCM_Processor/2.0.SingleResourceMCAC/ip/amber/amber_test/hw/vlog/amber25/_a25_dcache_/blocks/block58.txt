Comment: 
This line of code is defining a boolean condition named 'fill_state'. The 'fill_state' is true when the current state of the circuit, represented by 'c_state', is equivalent to 'CS_FILL', a predefined constant likely representing a fill operation in the state machine. This is achieved using the 'assign' keyword for continuous assignment and the '==' operator for equality check in Verilog.
