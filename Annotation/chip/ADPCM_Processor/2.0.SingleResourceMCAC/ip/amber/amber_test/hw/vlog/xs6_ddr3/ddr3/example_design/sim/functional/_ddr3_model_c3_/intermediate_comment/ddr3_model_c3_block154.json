    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code implements a sensitivity list on a specific bit of an address input signal to trigger a timing check function. The always keyword suggests that the block is sensitive to changes in bit 10 of the addr_in variable. When addr_in[10] changes, the cmd_addr_timing_check function is called with the argument of 17. This function could be used to verify the timing integrity of commands that involve this particular address input bit."
