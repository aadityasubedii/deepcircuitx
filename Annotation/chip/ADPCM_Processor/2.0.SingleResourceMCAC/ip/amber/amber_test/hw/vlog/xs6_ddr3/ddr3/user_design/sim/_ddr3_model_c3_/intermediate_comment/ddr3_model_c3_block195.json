    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a data transfer operation. Specifically, it employs an always block that gets triggered on the positive edge of the 14th bit of the `dqs_even` signal. When this condition is met, it calls the `dqs_even_receiver` function with the argument 13. Therefore, the block primarily serves to function as an event-driven receiver, specifically looking for transitions to the high state in the 14th bit of the `dqs_even` signal to initiate data reception via function call."
