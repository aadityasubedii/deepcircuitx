    "block_comment": "This block handles the logic for a data driven FIFO circuit. It uses a simple finite state design pattern, deciding its internal state based on the reset signal, availability of space in the FIFO, the user burst count, and the command start trigger. Based on these inputs, it conditions its data width appropriately for 16, 8, or 4 pins, manifesting in hex values chosen to match the associated bit widths. If the reset signal is detected, it zeroes out its information."
