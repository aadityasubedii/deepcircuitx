    "block_comment": "This block of code checks whether the count of the receive (RX) FIFO buffer is half full or more. It creates a signal, `rx_fifo_half_or_more`, which is assigned a boolean value based on whether the `rx_fifo_count` is greater than or equal to 8. If the condition is met, the signal will be high (1), otherwise, it will be low (0). This is achieved by a single line assignment in Verilog using the 'assign' keyword and a comparison operator.\n"
