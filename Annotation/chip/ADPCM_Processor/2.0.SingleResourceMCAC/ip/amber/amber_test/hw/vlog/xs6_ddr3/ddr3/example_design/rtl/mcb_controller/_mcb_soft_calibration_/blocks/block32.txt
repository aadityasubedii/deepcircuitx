This block primarily concerns with writing the "n-terminator" control in the I/O Delay Register Programmable Control Register (IODRPCTRLR) and setting the memory controller (MCB) UI address. It handles this by setting up the IODRPCTRLR's MEMCELL_ADDR with NTerm, its R_WB (read-write bit) to write mode, WRITE_DATA to a combination of 0 and N_Term_w, and the MCB_UIADDR to IOI_LDQS_PIN value. A valid command is then initialized, followed by a check on MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal. If it is true, the state is re-assigned to LDQS_PIN_WRITE_N_TERM, otherwise, it is set as LDQS_PIN_N_TERM_WAIT.
