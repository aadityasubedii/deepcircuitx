    "block_comment": "The block assigns the `data_hit_way[i]` signal based on three conditions. It verifies if the most significant bit of `tag_rdata_way[i]` is high and it checks whether the selected bits from `tag_rdata_way[i]` match with the selected bits from the `i_address` signal. Further, it ensures the current state is idle (`CS_IDLE`)."
