    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for checking the timing of a negative edge in the dqs_in signal at the 23rd bit. The check is triggered whenever there's a positive edge at the 23rd bit of the dqs_in signal. This is implemented by a function called \"dqs_neg_timing_check\" which is designed to perform the said operation only when the specific condition is met. In particular, it performs the timing check cycle at every positive edge of the given bit."
