Comment: 
This block of Verilog code represents a state machine transition control structure. When signal `IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N` is not ready or in busy state (active low), the state machine remains in the `WAIT3` state. Once `IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N` is ready (not busy), the state machine changes state to `LOAD_ZIO_NTERM`. This accommodates the system operation to sync with the readiness of the "IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N" signal.
