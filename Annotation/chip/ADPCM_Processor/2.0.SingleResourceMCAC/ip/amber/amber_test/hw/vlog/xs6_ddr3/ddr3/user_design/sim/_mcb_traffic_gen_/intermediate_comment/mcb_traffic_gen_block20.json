    "block_comment": "This block of code enables reading from the command FIFO queue. It uses bitwise operations for checking status and ensuring safe read operation. The read operation is allowed (cmd_fifo_rd is true) only if the command enable signal (mcb_cmd_en_o) is set and both the command FIFO overflow flag (mcb_cmd_full_i) and the FIFO empty flag (cmd_fifo_empty) are not set."
