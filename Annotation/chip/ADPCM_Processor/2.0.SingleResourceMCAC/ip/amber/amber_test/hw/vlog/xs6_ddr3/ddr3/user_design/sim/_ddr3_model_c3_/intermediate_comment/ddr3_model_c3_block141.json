    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for triggering a timing check event whenever a change is detected in the 6th bit (Indexed from 0) of the 'dm_in' input data bus. To achieve this, the 'always' keyword is used, which causes the 'dm_timing_check' function to be called with the parameter '6' every time the 6th bit of 'dm_in' is modified."
