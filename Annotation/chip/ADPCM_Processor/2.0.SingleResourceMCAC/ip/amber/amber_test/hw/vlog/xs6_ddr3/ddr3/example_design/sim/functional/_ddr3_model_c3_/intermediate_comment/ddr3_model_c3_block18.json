    "block_comment": "The block of code sets up an event that triggers on the negative edge of the 15th bit of the 'dqs_in' signal. This is achieved by using an 'always' block with sensitivity list '@(negedge dqs_in[14])' to initiate a call to the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' with the value '14' as argument whenever there's a falling edge on the 15th bit of 'dqs_in' signal.\n"
