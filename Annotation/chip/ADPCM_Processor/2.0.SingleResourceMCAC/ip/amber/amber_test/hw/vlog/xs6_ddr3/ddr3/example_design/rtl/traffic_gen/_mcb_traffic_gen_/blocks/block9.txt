The block of code enables the read operation for commands when the command buffer of the memory controller is not full. Implementation-wise, this is achieved via an assignment operation: a bitwise negation is performed on the full status of the command buffer and the result is bitwise AND'd with the output enable signal of the command buffer, which dictates whether command operations are permitted. The output of this operation is assigned to cmd_rd_en, enabling reading from the command buffer when it's not full and the command operation is allowed.
