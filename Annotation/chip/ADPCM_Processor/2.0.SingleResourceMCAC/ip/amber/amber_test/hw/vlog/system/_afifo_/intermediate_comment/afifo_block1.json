    "block_comment": "This block of code is a conversion function that transforms a 3-bit Gray code into an equivalent 3-bit binary code. It does this by taking the Gray code as an input and executing a case selection structure to map each possible combination of the Gray code to its corresponding binary notation. This process is hardcoded and exhaustive, covering all possible situations of 3-bit Gray codes, thereby ensuring accurate conversion."
