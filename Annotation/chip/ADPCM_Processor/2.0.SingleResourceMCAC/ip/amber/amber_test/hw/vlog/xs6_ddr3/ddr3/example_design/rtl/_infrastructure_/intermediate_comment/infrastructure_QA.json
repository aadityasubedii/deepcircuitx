It functions by taking various Input and Output parameters defined as constants. It firstly enables either differential or single-ended input clock types using an input buffer ('IBUFGDS' or 'IBUFG'). Then, a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) defined by 'PLL_ADV' helps to generate multiple targeted frequency outputs from the primary input clock after necessary division and multiplication. Base clocks are buffered using 'BUFG' and 'BUFGCE' modules. Moreover, the module handles the system reset functionality and ensures to apply the reset only when the PLL is locked. The BUFPLL_MCB instance links the PLL output clocks to the MCB interface, and the module also generates a delayed clock 'pll_ce_90' besides the primary clock 'pll_ce_0'. In summary, this module creates reliable clocking infrastructure for high-speed digital designs."
