    "block_comment": "This block of code is a clocked process that manages write buffer full flags in a memory controller. Based on an asynchronous reset and the number of items in the write FIFO buffer, it sets or clears the flags indicating that the buffer is full. The flags are updated following the system clock (clk_i) edge. If a reset signal (rst_ra) is received, mcb_wr_full_r1 is cleared. When the FIFO buffer count reaches or exceeds 63, mcb_wr_full_r1 and mcb_wr_full_r2 are set. Otherwise, they are cleared."
