Comment: 
This block manages the status of the TxRetryPacket signal in a synchronous transmission system, reacting to changes in the WB_CLK_I clock or a system reset. It sets the TxRetryPacket to low when a reset occurs, or when the transmission is not blocked, and the packet is either ready for first-time transmission or in need of a retry. The determinations are based on several status flags such as TxRetry_wb, tx_burst_en, MasterWbTX, MasterAccessFinished, and TxRetryPacketBlocked to reflect different transmission and system states.
