    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls a read pointer for a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure setup. When the system reset (rst) signal is received, the read pointer (rd_ptr) and the corresponding Gray code (rd_gray) are reset synchronously with the read clock (rd_clk), ensuring they start from an initial state. In normal operation, at each read clock positive edge, if a read strobe (rd_strobe) signal is received, the read pointer is incremented by one. Further, the current state of the read pointer is stored in a temporary variable (rd_ptr_tmp), and the Gray code for the next state is stored in the present rd_gray register. The use of Gray code here is crucial for synchronizing between two clock domains, reducing the risk of misinterpretation due to clock skew issues."
