    "block_comment": "This block assigns the transmit state of a serial communication protocol. It uses a ternary operator (? :) to assign state values to `xTXD_STATE` based on the current value of `txd_state`. This process helps in identifying and flagging which data byte or signal (idle, start, data bits or stop signals) is being transmitted. If `txd_state` doesn't match any predefined states, \"UNKNOWN\" is assigned to `xTXD_STATE` as a default."
