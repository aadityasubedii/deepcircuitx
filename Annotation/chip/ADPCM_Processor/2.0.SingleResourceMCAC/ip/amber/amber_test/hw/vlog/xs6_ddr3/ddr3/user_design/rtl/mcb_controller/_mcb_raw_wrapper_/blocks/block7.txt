This block of code generates output buffer for the DDR3 memory reset control. If the memory type is identified as DDR3, a specific instance of the output buffer (OBUFT) named 'iob_rst' is created. This instance connects the input signal 'ioi_rst' and control signal 't_rst' to the DDR3 memory reset output 'mcbx_dram_ddr3_rst', enabling the control of the DDR3 memory reset function.
