Comment: 
This block of code manages the reset condition, Rst_condition1, in a digital system based on the value of the reset counter, RstCounter. When the rising edge of the UI_CLK clock signal is detected, the state of RstCounter is compared to a constant, TZQINIT_MAXCNT. If RstCounter has reached or exceeded TZQINIT_MAXCNT, the reset condition, Rst_condition1, is set high (1'b1). Otherwise, the reset condition is set low (1'b0).
