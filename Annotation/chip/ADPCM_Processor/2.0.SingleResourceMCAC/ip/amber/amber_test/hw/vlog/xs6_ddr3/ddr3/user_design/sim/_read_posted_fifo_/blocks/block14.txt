This block is responsible for updating the cmd_rdy_o signal as per certain conditions. The cmd_rdy_o signal is only updated at the positive edge of the clk_i (input clock) signal. The value of cmd_rdy_o will be the logical AND of three other signals/conditions: not full, dfifo_has_enough_room, and wait_done. The first implies that the DONE flag is negated, second means that the FPGA's inbuilt FIFO has sufficient room and third 'wait_done' suggests that a specific wait operation is finished. This code effectively synchronizes the readiness of a command based on the clock signal and certain prerequisites.
