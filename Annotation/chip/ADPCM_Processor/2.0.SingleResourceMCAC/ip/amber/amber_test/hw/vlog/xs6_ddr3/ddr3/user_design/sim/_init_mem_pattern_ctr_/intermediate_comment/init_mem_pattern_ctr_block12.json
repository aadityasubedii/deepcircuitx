    "block_comment": "The code block generates a signal called 'tst_matched' that indicates whether both 'upper_end_matched' and 'lower_end_matched' signals are true. It uses the bitwise AND operator (&) on 'upper_end_matched' and 'lower_end_matched' signals to achieve this. If both signals are true, 'tst_matched' will be set to true (1), otherwise, it will be set to false (0).\n"
