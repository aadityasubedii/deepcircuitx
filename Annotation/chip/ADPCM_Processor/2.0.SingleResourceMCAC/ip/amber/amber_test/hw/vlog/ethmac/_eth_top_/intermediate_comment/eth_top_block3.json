    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the synchronization and reset of a receiver abort signal (`RxAbort`). The block is controlled by the rising edge of a clock signal (`wb_clk_i`) or a reset signal (`wb_rst_i`). If a reset signal is present, it sets two register `RxAbort_sync1` and `RxAbort_wb` to 0. When there isn't a reset, the `RxAbort_sync1` register is updated with the value of `RxAbort_latch` and `RxAbort_wb` is updated with the value from `RxAbort_sync1`. This shows a one-cycle delay in signal transition from `RxAbort_latch` to `RxAbort_wb` via `RxAbort_sync1`."
