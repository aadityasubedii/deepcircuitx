Comment: 
The block of code provided defines a task named `wshift` in Verilog, which formats and writes shift operations used in an executed instruction to a decomposed file. This is achieved by evaluating the two most significant bits of the `execute_instruction` variable, comparing with different shift instructions like "Logical Shift Left (LSL)", "Logical Shift Right (LSR)", "Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR)", "Rotate Right with Extend (RRX)", and "Rotate Right (ROR)". The specific shift instruction and immediate shift amount 'shift_imm' are then written to `decompile_file`. If these two bits don't indicate "Rotate Right", or the shift immediate is not zero, it also writes the shift amount to the file.
