    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a math function for multiply and divide operations on 8-bit inputs. It multiplies an `Input` value by a `Mult` value and then divides the result by a `Div` value. The function utilizes a iterative loop to perform the multiply operation by incrementally adding the `Input` value to 'Result' for `Mult` times. Then, the 'Result' is divided by `Div`. The final output 'Mult_Divide' is the least significant 8 bits of 'Result'."
