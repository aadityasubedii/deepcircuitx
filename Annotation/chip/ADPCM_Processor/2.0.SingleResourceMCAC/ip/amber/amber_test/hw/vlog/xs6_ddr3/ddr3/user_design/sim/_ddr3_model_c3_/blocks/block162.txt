This block of code is meant to monitor changes in the third bit of the `addr_in` signal and accordingly trigger the `cmd_addr_timing_check` function with a constant input,9. It basically constitutes a part of some timing check system by continuously observing a specific bit of `addr_in` and invoking a checking routine with a pre-defined parameter. The 'always' keyword in Verilog is leveraged to ensure the said logic block gets evaluated whenever the specific addr_in bit changes its state.
