Module-level comment: This module implements the Ethernet controller's register block, managing configuration and status registers for Ethernet operations. It handles read/write operations to various registers, synchronizes signals between clock domains, and generates interrupt signals. The module uses multiple sub-registers for different functionalities, implements clock domain crossing for certain signals, and provides access to Ethernet parameters such as MAC address, flow control settings, and interrupt masks. It plays a crucial role in controlling and monitoring the Ethernet controller's behavior by interfacing with other modules and providing a centralized configuration point.
