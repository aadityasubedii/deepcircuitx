    "block_comment": "The block of code performs a logical shift right (LSR) operation for a hardware system. In the first line, the least significant bit of the output (`lsr_out[0]`) is being assigned the result of a bitwise AND operation between the 32nd bit of the temporary register (`p_r[31]`) and the 32nd bit of the mask (`lsr_mask[31]`). In the second line, depending on conditionals, it assigns the second least significant bit of the output. If `i_shift_imm_zero` is true, the second bit of the output (`lsr_out[1]`) is assigned the 32nd bit of the input (`i_in[31]`), otherwise it checks if `shift_nzero` is true then performs a bitwise AND operation similar to line one, and if both conditions are false, the bit is assigned the carry-in signal (`i_carry_in`)."
