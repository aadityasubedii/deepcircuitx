Comment: 
The block of Verilog RTL code assigns the output `last_word_o` based on the bitwise AND operation between variables `u_bcount_2` and `fifo_not_full`. The output `last_word_o` turns true if both the variables `u_bcount_2` and `fifo_not_full` are true, indicating that the last word operation is occurring when the binary counter `u_bcount_2` is active and the FIFO is not full. This design enables efficient utilization of memory space without overflow by monitoring the FIFO full status.
