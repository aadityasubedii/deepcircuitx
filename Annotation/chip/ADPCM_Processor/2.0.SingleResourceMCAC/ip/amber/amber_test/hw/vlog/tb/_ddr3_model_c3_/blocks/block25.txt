This block is a negedge-triggered timing check function specific to a DQS (data strobe) memory bus signal. The function dqs_neg_timing_check is called whenever there's a falling edge on the eighth bit of the dqs_in bus, effectively monitoring and appropriately processing data transactions during every negative edge of this particular DQS signal.
