The function logb2 calculates the base-2 logarithm of an integer. It is implemented using bitwise mathematical operations in an iterative manner. An integer 'i' is initialized as the input 'in'. In a loop that executes until 'i' becomes 0, 'i' is right-shifted repeatedly by one bit which effectively divides 'i' by 2. The variable 'logb2' is incremented in each step of the loop to count the iterations, providing the approximate base-2 logarithm of the input.
