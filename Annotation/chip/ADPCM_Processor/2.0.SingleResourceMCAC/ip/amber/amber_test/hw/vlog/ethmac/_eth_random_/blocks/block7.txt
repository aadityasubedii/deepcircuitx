Comment: 
This block manages the shift register function with a reset option. Upon a positive edge of either MTxClk or Reset signals, the state of the 10-bit register x is updated based on the logic: if Reset is high, x is cleared (set to 0); otherwise, a right shift operation is performed on x, and the new LSB (Least Significant Bit) is filled with the Feedback bit value.
