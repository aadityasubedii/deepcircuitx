    "block_comment": "This block of code handles timing checks of a data strobe value within a synchronous block. It achieves its functionality by triggering the 'always' block at the negative edge of the 'dqs_in' value at the 4th index (3 when starting index from 0). When such condition occurs, it calls the dqs_neg_timing_check function with the index position 3 as an argument."
