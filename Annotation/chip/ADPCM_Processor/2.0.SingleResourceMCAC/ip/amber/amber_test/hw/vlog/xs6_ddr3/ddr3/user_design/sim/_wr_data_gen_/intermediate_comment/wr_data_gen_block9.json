    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the readiness of a command signal, `cmd_rdyB`, in a synchronous digital circuit. It is designed to respond to a rising edge clock signal, `clk_i`. Upon a high reset signal, `rst_i[0]`, or the start of the command, `cmd_startB`, with `bl_i` equals 1, or when `user_burst_cnt` equals 2 and `fifo_not_full` is true, it sets the `cmd_rdyB` to high with a specific delay indicated by `TCQ`. Otherwise, it sets `cmd_rdyB` to low when `cmd_startB` is high and `bl_i` is not 1. Thus, this block manages the command readiness with regard to the reset signal, command start signal, block size, and FIFO full status."
