    "block_comment": "The block of code is implementing a latency-optimized valid signal generation logic. Specifically, it assigns `v6_data_cmp_valid` signal a delay equivalent to `TCQ`, whenever there is a positive edge detected on the input clock `clk_i` and if `rd_mdata_en` signal is enabled. The valid signal `v6_data_cmp_valid` will be used later to validate the data comparison operations in the downstream pipeline stages of the design."
