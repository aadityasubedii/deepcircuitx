    "block_comment": "This block serves as a synchronous reset and data control module in a Verilog design. At positive edge of a Reset or Clock signal, if Reset is active, it initializes Mdo_2d, Mdo_d, and Mdo signals to zero. If Reset is not active, and the MdcEn_n signal is high, it computes the Mdo_2d, Mdo_d, and Mdo signals based on the current values of SerialEn, BitCounter, and ShiftedBit. In particular, the block performs bitwise operations to produce Mdo_2d, then uses this value together with ShiftedBit value to generate Mdo_d, which ultimately is assigned to Mdo.\n"
