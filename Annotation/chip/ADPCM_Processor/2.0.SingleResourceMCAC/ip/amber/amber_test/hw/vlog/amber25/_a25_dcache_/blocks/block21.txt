This block manages the data read operation for a cache memory module with configurable number of ways. Depending on the cache configuration, i.e., 2-way, 3-way, 4-way or 8-way, it assigns a hit data based on the way in which a cache hit occurs. If a hit occurs at the n-th way, the corresponding data from the n-th way is assigned to `hit_rdata`. If no hit occurs in any way, `hit_rdata` is assigned to the default cache line width value, which is a series of '1'.
