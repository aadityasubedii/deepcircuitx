Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for assigning a value to the variable `r14_rds` based on the modes of execution from `i_mode_rds_exec`. If the USR mode is active, `r14` is assigned to `r14_rds`. If the SVC mode is active, `r14_svc` is assigned. If the IRQ mode is active, `r14_irq` is assigned and if none of these modes are active, `r14_firq` is assigned to `r14_rds`. The block uses the ternary operator (`?:`) to decide which assignment to make based on the active execution mode.
