Comment: 
The block assigns string identifiers to different states in the "c_state" control signal. The system compares the value of "c_state" to each listed state, providing a human-readable description of the active state. The states include initialization, idleness, filling, filling completion, deletion request handling, turnaround, write hit, waiting writeback during write hit, and waiting writeback for write miss operations. If the "c_state" does not match any predefined states, an "UNKNOWN" flag is assigned representing an error or an undefined state.
