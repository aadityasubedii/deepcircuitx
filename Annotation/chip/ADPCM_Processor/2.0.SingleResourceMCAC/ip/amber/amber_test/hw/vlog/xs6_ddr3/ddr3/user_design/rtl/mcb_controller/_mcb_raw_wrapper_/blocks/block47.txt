This block manages the assignment of variables for a memory interface generator (MIG) in B64_B64 configuration mode. If port 0 is enabled, it assigns the corresponding "p0_" properties to the corresponding "mig_p_" properties for arbitration, command, write, and read operations. It includes specific controls for AXI interface mode. In normal read/write, it checks if the operation is full or empty. If port 0 is not enabled, all properties are set to 'b0 disabling all relevant MIG operations.
