The block of code is a sequential circuit that facilitates the start event of a specific process in response to the wishbone clock (WB_CLK_I) or reset signal. Implemented using Verilog, its operation hinges on edge detection; specifically, positive edges of WB_CLK_I or the Reset signal. If Reset is high, it resets the flag StartOccured. When TxStartFrm_wb is asserted,  it marks the occurrence of the start event by setting StartOccured high. In case ResetTxBDReady is triggered, the StartOccured flag is reset.
