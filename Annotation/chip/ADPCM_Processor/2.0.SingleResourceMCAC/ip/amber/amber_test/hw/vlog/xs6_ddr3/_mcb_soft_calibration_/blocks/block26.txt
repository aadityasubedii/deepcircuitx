This Verilog block functions as an I/O Digital Resistance Programmable (DRP) controller memory cell and a Memory Controller Block (MCB) to set specific parameters. The block assigns the value of the Physical Termination impedance to the address, sets the controller mode to WRITE, and assigns the signal P_Term_s with two zeroes prefixed to the write data. It further assigns an input/output double data rate user data strobe pin to the MCB user address and sends a command validation signal. If the MCB is ready, the state transitions to writing to the user data strobe pin.
