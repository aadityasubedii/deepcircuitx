It has the ability to perform both read and write operations with parameters such as data width and select width. This module has different processes for memory access depending on the defined data width (either 32-bit or 128-bit). It includes mechanisms to prevent simultaneous read and write operations to the same data block (`busy` assignment and usage), and uses write enable (wr_en) and read strobes (start_read_d1, start_read_d2) to properly sequence reading and writing. While writing, it considers a write-enable mask and the write data is stored into a RAM of this memory module. During reading, the read data is fetched from the RAM. The acknowledgement signals for both write (`start_write`) and read (`start_read_d2`) operations are combined to produce the overall acknowledgement `o_wb_ack`. The module also seems to have some debug facilities to trace memory write events with specific pragma declared."

They act as 'remember' devices for the read process from one clock pulse to the next.\n\n- rd_data: This is the actual data read from the internal memory (ram). It's 128 bits wide, spanning the entire width of the memory.\n\n- masked_wdata: This data is the masked version of the write data. The masking process is controlled by `wr_mask`, allowing for selective byte updates via write operations.\n\n- wr_en: This signal is used to enable the write operation. It gets updated with the value of the `start_write` signal at each clock cycle.\n\n- wr_mask: This signal is used to mask the write data during write operations. The configuration of bits in this mask decides which part of data gets written.\n\n- wr_data: The data to be written to memory. It gets updated with the value of the `i_wb_dat` signal at each clock cycle.\n\n- addr_d1: Address of the memory location where write operation occurs or read data gets fetched from.\n\n- busy: This signal is used to indicate whether the memory is currently engaged in a read or write operation.\n\n- i: This is a genvar variable which is used in generate loop structures in Verilog.
