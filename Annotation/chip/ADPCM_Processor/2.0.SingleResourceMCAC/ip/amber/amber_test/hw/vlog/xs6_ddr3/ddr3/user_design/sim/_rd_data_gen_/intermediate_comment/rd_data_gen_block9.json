    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a synchronous counter. This counter is reset on the rising edge of the clock whenever 'rst_i'[0] is high. If 'cmd_start' is high, the counter is set to 'bl_i' or 64 ('1000000' in binary) if 'bl_i' is zero. If 'data_port_fifo_rdy' is high and 'user_burst_cnt' is not zero, it decrements the counter by one, otherwise, the counter is kept at zero. This block of code has built-in contingencies for multiple inputs hence, allowing variable countdown values based on different scenarios, which makes it integral to managing data flow or timing operations within larger systems in which it's used."
