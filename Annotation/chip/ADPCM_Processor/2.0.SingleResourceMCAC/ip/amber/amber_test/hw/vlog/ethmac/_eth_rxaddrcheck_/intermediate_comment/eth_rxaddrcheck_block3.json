    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for assigning an internal hash value. It effectively performs a conditional selection between two preset hash values, HASH1 and HASH0. The selection criterion is determined by the 6th bit of CrcHash array; if the bit is set ('1'), it selects HASH1, otherwise, it picks HASH0."
