    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a conditional check in the testbench for a 32-bit data bus (NUM_DQ_PINS equals to 32) under certain defined data patterns (DGEN_NEIGHBOR, DGEN_WALKING1, DGEN_WALKING0, DGEN_ALL). It is implemented using a conditional 'if' statement inside a 'generate' construct to create synthesizable RTL based on a set of conditions. The structure is labeled with `WALKING_ONE_32_PATTERN` for identification."
