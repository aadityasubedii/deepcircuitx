    "module": "Module-level comment: This is the a23_ram_register_bank, a Verilog module emulating a CPU's register bank. It manages read/write operations, various execution modes, and updates register values based on mode and select signals. The module uses input ports for incoming signals like execution mode, write selector, program counter, and register values, whereas output ports provide the current register values. Internal signals are used for operating modes, addressing, and flagging elements inside the module. It includes signal assignments, register assignments, event-driven block for updating register values and a function to compute register address. It directly impacts the processing capability of the ARM A23 modelled CPU.\n"
