    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as an interrupt handler for a transmission (tx) process in a Wishbone bus system. Implemented as an always block in Verilog, it triggers on every rising edge of the system clock (WB_CLK_I) or when a Reset signal is received. Upon a Reset, it clears the TxB_IRQ flag. If not resetting, and if both the TxStatusWrite and TxIRQEn conditions are met, it negates the TxError signal and assigns it to TxB_IRQ. In case neither the reset condition, nor the twin-conditions of TxStatusWrite and TxIRQEn are met, it defaults to clear the TxB_IRQ flag."
