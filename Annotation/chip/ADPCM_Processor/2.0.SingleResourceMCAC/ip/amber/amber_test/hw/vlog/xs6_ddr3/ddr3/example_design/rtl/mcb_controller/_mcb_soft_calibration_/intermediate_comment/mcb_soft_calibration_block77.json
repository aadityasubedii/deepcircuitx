    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a system reset in the Microcontroller Block (MCB). The system reset `MCB_SYSRST` is assigned the value of `Pre_SYSRST`. This line essentially acts as a level trigger for system reset, which indicates that when `Pre_SYSRST` changes its state, `MCB_SYSRST` will immediately reflect the same. It's effectively a wire assignment in Verilog that ties the two signals together."
