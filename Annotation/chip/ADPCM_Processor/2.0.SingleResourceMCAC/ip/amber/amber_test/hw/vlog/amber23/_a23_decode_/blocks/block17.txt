Comment: 
The block functions as an encoded interrupt handler, assigning the next interrupt based on various trigger events occurring on the system. This assignment of interrupts is prioritized and handled through conditional statements, using a ternary '?' operator, forming a priority chain in the order of the conditions. `dabt_request` is given the highest priority `3'd1`, followed by `firq_request` with a lower priority `3'd2`, and so forth. If none of the specified conditions are met, it defaults the `next_interrupt` to `3'd0`.
