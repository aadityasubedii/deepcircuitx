    "block_comment": "The block of code is a state machine handling the transitions and operations for reading and writing in a media-dependent interface (MDI). States in this system include idle, start, read, write, physical address, register address, turn, read data, write data, and write transfer. The transitions between states depend on a combination of the current state and the input 'md_io'. For reading and writing operations, the respective data is processed bit by bit, with each bit being shifted for its position and retrieved or assigned to related registers (md_rdata_r, md_wdata_r, md_bmcr_r, md_ctrl1000_r). Register and physical addresses are also constructed in this approach. The state transitions typically reset the state to idle upon completion of the tasks."
