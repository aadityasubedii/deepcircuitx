    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code implements a detection mechanism for the start of RX signal in a serial communication scenario. Specifically, the 'assign' keyword is used to continuously assign the value of the 'rx_start' signal. The code checks the 3rd and 4th bits of the 'rxd_d' variable and the 1st and 2nd bits as well, verifying if they respectively match '11' and '00'. If the condition holds true, the 'rx_start' signal is asserted, indicating the start of RX operation."
