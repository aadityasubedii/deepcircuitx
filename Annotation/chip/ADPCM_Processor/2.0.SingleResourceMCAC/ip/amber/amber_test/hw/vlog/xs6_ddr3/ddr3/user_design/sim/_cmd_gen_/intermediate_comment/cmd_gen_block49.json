    "block_comment": "This block of code is a data pipeline clocked by a positive edge of clk_i. It takes in an input signal and processes it on various conditions, ensuring appropriate modification and alignment dependent on data width(DWIDTH) and address mode. On reset, it initializes with start address. If instr_vld is high, data is modified based on the addr_mode_reg and gen_addr_larger condition. For different data widths (32, 64, and 128 bits), different bit alignment logic is implemented to fill pipe_data_in."
