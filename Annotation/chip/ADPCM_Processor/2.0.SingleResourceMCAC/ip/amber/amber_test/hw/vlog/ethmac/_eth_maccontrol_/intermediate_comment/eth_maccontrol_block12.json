    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling a multiplexed abort signal (`MuxedAbort`) within a transmitter module. The operation of this block is driven by the positive edge of either `MTxClk` (possibly a Module specific Transmission Clock) or `TxReset` (Transmit Reset signal). The `MuxedAbort` is reset to 0 both on receiving a `TxReset` signal and at the start of a new transmission (`TxStartFrmIn` is high). However, `MuxedAbort` is set to 1 if an abort command (`TxAbortIn`) is received, which isn't already latched (`~TxAbortInLatched`), and output data has been detected (`TxUsedDataOutDetected`). This code effectively aids in aborting a transmission whenever unwanted output data is detected."
