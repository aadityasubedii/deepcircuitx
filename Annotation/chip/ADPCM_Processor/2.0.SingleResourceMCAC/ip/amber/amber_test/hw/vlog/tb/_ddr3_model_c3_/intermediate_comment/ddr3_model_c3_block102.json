    "block_comment": "This block of code is meant to keep track of the array element `dq_in[28]` and call the function `dq_timing_check` every time this value changes. It does this using the keyword `always @`, which sets up a sensitivity list that the system checks continuously. When a change is detected in the list (in this case, the value of `dq_in[28]`), the system executes the function call that follows (`dq_timing_check(28)`). This process is crucial in digital logic design for monitoring changes in signal values."
