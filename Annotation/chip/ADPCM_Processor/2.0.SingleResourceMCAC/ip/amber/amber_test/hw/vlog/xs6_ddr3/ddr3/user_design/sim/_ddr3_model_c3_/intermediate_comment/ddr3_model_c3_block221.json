    "block_comment": "The block of code is a task for writing data to memory in a Verilog design. The function takes in bank, row, col, and data parameters for specifying the memory address and the data to be written. Depending upon the definition of MAX_MEM, the memory address is computed differently. If MAX_MEM is defined, it uses row and col. If MAX_MEM is not defined, it uses bank, row, and col. Then, it writes the data to the computed address. There is an error check in place which halts the operation upon memory overflow. This task is useful for loading test data or initializing the memory in a hardware simulation environment."
