This block of code is used to initiate a timing check whenever there's a change in the `we_n_in` signal. The `always` keyword in Verilog triggers a resultant action on every change of the mentioned signal. Here, the action is executing the `cmd_addr_timing_check` function with an argument of 3. This function is likely designed to handle timing control or validate the timing of certain operations in the hardware design. The function implementation is not provided here, but it's expected to use the argument `3` to perform some specific hardware timing checks.
