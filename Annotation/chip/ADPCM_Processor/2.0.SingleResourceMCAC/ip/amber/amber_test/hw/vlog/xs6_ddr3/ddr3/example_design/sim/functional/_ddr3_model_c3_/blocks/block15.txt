This code block implements a timing event check for a specified data bit in a data set ("dqs_in") on the rising edge signal cycle. It uses a built-in procedure "always @" to monitor for changes or value updates at the specified index value 17 on the data quantization set "dqs_in". The procedure initiates a secondary user-defined procedure "dqs_neg_timing_check()" whenever it detects a positive edge signal on the 18th element of "dqs_in". Notice that when the positive edge of the "dqs_in[17]" signal occurs, this functional call will be made.
