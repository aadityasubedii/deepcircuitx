    "module": "Module-level comment: \"This infrastructure module manages the clock and reset infrastructure of an RTL design. It uses input signals like system clocks and a system reset to generate various clock, reset, and control outputs. Internal signals help adjust clocks, maintain reset stability, and indicate lock status. Elements like differential/single-ended input clock sections, a PLL for signal adjustments, and a BUFPLL_MCB for clock multiplication, division, and phase shifting are used. Additionally, mechanisms for asynchronous reset generation and resetting synchronization with the output clock are in place.\""
