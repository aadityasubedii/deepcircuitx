    "block_comment": "The block executes a timing check for the 54th bit of the `dq_in` signal. This operation is conducted each time there's a change in the state of the 54th bit of the `dq_in` signal (in Verilog, the bit indexing starts from `0`). Specifically, the block calls the `dq_timing_check` function and passes the index `53` as the argument whenever a change is detected in the bit. This enables dynamic timing verification for this specific data line in the larger design context."
