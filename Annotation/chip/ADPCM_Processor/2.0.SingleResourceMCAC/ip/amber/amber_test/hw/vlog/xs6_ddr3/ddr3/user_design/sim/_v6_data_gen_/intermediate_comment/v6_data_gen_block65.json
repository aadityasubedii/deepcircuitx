    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a clock-triggered signal setting for the `sel_w1gen_logic`. Upon each rising edge of the input clock `clk_i`, the code checks the 3 least significant bits of `data_mode_rr_c`. If these bits are either `101`, `100`, or `110`, `sel_w1gen_logic` is set to `1'b1` with a delay defined by `#TCQ`; otherwise, it is set to `0` with the same delay."
