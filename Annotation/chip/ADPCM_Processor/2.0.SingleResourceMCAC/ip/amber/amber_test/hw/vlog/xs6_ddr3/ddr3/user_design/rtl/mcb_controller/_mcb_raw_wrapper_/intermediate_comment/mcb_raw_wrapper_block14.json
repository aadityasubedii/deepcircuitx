    "block_comment": "The block configures input-output delay registers and programmable delay elements for a memory controller interface. It does this by invoking multiple instances of the IODRP2_MCB module for Data (DQ), Data strobe(DQS), Upper Data Mask(UDM), and Lower Data Mask(LDM). These elements are configured with specific delay values, data rates, and addresses. Internally, each instance is associated with memory update signals, clock signals, and input data and acts as a Master or Slave in a double data rate (DDR) configuration. The block also configures auxiliary information for the IODRP2_MCB module, ensuring data integrity during the transfer through the interface. Each instance handles separate data bit, allowing for parallel data management."
