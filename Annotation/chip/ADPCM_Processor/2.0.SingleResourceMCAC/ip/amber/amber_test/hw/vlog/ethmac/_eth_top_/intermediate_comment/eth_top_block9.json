    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a register update conditionally on a clock's rising edge or system reset. During reset (signified by 'wb_rst_i' high), the register 'WillSendControlFrame_sync2' is cleared to zero. In the absence of reset, and on every rising clock edge, 'WillSendControlFrame_sync2' takes the delayed value of 'WillSendControlFrame_sync1', with an assigned propagation delay (Tp).\n"
