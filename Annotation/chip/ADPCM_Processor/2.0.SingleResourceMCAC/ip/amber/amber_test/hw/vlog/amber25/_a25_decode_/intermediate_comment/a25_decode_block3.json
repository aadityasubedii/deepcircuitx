    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a synchronous system that reacts to a high reset or clock edge. Its purpose is to manage interrupt signals and data abort (dabt) signals under specific core and control state conditions. Upon reset, all signals are set to 0. However, when reset is not invoked, the interrupt (IRQ, FIR) and data abort (dabt_reg) signals are updated based on the input signals and internal state conditions. If the core is not stalled, the irq, and firq signals mirror the corresponding input signals, whereas the data abort register (dabt_reg) is updated depending on the control state and status mode. If the control state is INT_WAIT1 and status mode is SVC, dabt_reg is kept zero, otherwise, it captures incoming aborts. In every non-reset and non-stalled condition, the data abort register (dabt_reg_d1) is updated with the present value of dabt_reg."
