    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to control the Serial Data Input (SDI) of a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) in Verilog. If the CS (Chip Select) control signal (DRP_CS) for DRP is HIGH, it assigns the least significant bit (LSB) of the shift_through_reg register to DRP_SDI_pre; otherwise, it assigns '0' to DRP_SDI_pre. This mechanism ensures that SDI only accepts data when the CS signal is active, preventing undesired data from entering the port when CS is inactive."
