    "block_comment": "This block of code utilizes an edge-sensitive hardware description for a Digital Quality Service (DQS) receiver module, executed on every rising edge of dqs_even[4]. Here, we use a Verilog always block which allows the creation of dynamic behaviour in hardware. When dqs_even[4] sees a positive edge, the DQS receiver for the even line number 4 is triggered, ensuring data is received correctly in reference to the corresponding data strobe signal."
