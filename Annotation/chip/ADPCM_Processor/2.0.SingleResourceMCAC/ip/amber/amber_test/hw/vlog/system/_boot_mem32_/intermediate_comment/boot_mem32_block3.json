    "block_comment": "The given block of code represents a memory module instantiation in Verilog. This module's function is to perform data read and write operations. The module is activated by the clock signal (`i_wb_clk`) and uses signals `start_write`, `byte_enable`, `address`, `write_data` to write data into the memory. Furthermore, it spits out `read_data` from the memory based on given `address`."
