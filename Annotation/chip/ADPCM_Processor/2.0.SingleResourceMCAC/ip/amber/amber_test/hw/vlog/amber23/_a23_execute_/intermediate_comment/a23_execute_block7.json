    "block_comment": "This line of code is performing a conditional assignment operation for the `carry_in` signal. If the input `i_use_carry_in` is true, then `carry_in` is assigned the value of the second bit of the `status_bits_flags` register. If `i_use_carry_in` is false, then `carry_in` is simply set to zero."
