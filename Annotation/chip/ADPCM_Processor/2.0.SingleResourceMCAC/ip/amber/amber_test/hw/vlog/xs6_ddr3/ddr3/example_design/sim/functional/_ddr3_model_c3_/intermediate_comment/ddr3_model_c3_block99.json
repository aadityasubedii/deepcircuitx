    "block_comment": "This block of code induces a timing check for the most significant bit (MSB) of an input data queue (dq_in). The operation is triggered by any change in the state of the 31st bit (MSB, considering 0 based indexing) of \"dq_in\". Once the MSB changes, the function \"dq_timing_check\" is called with '31' (the index of MSB of dq_in) as the argument, to ensure that the signal is being received at the expected time."
