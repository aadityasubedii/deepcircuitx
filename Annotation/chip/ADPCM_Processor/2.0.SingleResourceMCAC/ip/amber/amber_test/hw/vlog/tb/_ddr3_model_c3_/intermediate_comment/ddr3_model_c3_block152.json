    "block_comment": "This block of code is used as a procedural block that triggers based on the 13th bit of the `addr_in` signal. Component usage entails invoking the function `cmd_addr_timing_check` with an argument of `19` whenever there is a change in the state of the `addr_in[12]`, which allows it to monitor and maintain the timing of command addresses within the hardware design."
