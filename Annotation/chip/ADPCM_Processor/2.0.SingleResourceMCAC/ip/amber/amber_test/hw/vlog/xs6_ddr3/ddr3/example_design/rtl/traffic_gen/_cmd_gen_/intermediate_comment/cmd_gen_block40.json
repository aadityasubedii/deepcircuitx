    "block_comment": "The function of this block of code is to manage the count of read data received on a system. It keeps track of each individual read operation and a cumulative count of this read operation. During each clock cycle, when the system reset signal 'rst_i[0]' is set, both types of counters are reset to 0 due to synchronous reset logic. However, if the reset is not set and there is a signal for the reading of read data 'reading_rd_data_i', both counters are incremented by one, reflecting input data flow state tracking, and cumulative inbound data monitoring."
