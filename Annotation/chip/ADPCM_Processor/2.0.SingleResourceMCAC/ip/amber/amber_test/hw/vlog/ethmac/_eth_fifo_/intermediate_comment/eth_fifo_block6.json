    "block_comment": "The block of code is used as a counter in digital system design. This counter is enhanced with reset, clear and control based on 'read' & 'write' signals. At every 'clk' clock edge, the counter examines the signals 'reset', 'clear', and a XOR of 'read' and 'write'. When 'reset' signal is set, the counter is reset to 0. If 'clear' is set, the counter is configured to the XOR of 'read' and 'write' values. Lastly, if 'read' and 'write' are different, the counter is incremented by 1 if 'write' is active, and decremented by 1 if 'read' is active. The '#Tp' indicates there may be a propagation delay for each operation."
