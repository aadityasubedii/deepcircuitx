    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is configurable to two operational modes based on the C_S4_AXI_ENABLE flag. If C_S4_AXI_ENABLE is 0, the code assigns several system interface signals, with each one uniquely mapped to a corresponding module interface signal. When C_S4_AXI_ENABLE is not 0, the Verilog block assigns p4_arb_en_i and manipulates the address signals to be within the address mask, and then uses the mcb_ui_top_synch and axi_mcb modules to synchronize system operations. There are further specific assignments of inputs and outputs to the axi_mcb module signals, allowing for communication and synchronization between different hardware units."
