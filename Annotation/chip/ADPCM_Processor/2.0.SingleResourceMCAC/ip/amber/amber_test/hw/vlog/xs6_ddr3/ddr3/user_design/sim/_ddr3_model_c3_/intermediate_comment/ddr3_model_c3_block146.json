    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a Verilog hardware description language process that listens for changes on the `dm_in[1]` signal, and then triggers the `dm_timing_check(1)` function. This function is scheduled to run every time there's a change in the `dm_in[1]`signal, which is, in this case, the digital input for the data communication."
