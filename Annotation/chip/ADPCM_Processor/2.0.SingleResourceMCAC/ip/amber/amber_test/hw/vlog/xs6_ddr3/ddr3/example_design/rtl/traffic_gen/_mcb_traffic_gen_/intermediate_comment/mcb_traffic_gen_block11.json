    "block_comment": "This block of code represents an instantiation of an asynchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) memory module with associated control signals. The module \"afifo\", with parameters for latency, data size, depth, address size, and synchronization setup, is instantiated as \"rd_mdata_fifo\". The block is making use of system clock \"clk_i\" for both write and read operations. Write enable signal \"wr_en\" is driven by negation of \"mcb_rd_empty\" while read enable is passed by \"mcb_rd_en_o\". Data is written into the FIFO through \"mcb_rd_data_i\" and read from \"rd_v6_mdata\". Presence of signals for \"full\", \"almost_full\", and \"empty\" provide information about the status of the FIFO."
