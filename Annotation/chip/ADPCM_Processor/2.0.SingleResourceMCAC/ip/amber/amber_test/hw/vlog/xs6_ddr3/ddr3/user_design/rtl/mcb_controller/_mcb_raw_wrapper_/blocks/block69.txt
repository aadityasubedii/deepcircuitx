This block serves the purpose of controlling the reading and writing operations of the Memory Interface Generator's (MIG's) port 0. Depending on the status of the C_PORT_ENABLE signal, it either enables these operations or disables them. When C_PORT_ENABLE is high, the block aligns the read and write control signals (clock, enable, mask, data), as well as the statuses (full, empty, error, overflow, underrun, count) between the port 0 (p0) and MIG's port 0 (mig_p0). When C_PORT_ENABLE is low, the block deactivates the aforementioned read and write operations by assigning these signals and statuses to zero.
