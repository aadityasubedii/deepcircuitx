    "block_comment": "This function reads values from memory. It takes two inputs, a flag (tx) and a 32-bit address. If the tx flag is set, it reads a value from the 'mem' array at an index 3 positions ahead of the specified address. If the tx flag is not set, it reads a value from the 'rxm' array at the specified address."
