    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for setting up a broadcast request in a memory controller. The address of the target memory cell and the data to write are taken from `NTerm` and `{2'b00,N_Term}` respectively, and operation mode is set to write. The `MCB_CMD_VALID`, `MCB_USE_BKST` fields are set to high, indicating a valid command and that the backup store should be used. The `MCB_UIDRPUPDATE` is negated by `First_In_Term_Done`, thereby updating only during the first term. Based on the memory controller's readiness, the state either remains in `BROADCAST_NTERM` or transitions to `WAIT6`.\n"
