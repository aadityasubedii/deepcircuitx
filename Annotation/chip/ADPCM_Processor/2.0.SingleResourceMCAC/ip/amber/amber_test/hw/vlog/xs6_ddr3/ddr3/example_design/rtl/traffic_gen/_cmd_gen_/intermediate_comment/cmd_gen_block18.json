    "block_comment": "This block of code is a parallel-to-serial converter configured with a generic/unspecified number of bits for conversion. The initial functionality is implemented through the 'genvar' loop, which generates parallel inputs alongside corresponding shift registers to convert parallel inputs into a serial output. The shift register is used to sequentially shift the parallel input bits to a single output bit concurrently on each clock cycle. The implementation uses 'always @(posedge clk)' to capture the stable parallel input and 'if (reset)' signal to set the shift register to input when a reset event occurs, indicating a new parallel word is ready for conversion."
