    "block_comment": "This block of code is for data strobe timing checks. It implements a timing check function, `dqs_pos_timing_check`, that gets triggered on the positive edge of the 12th bit of the `dqs_in` signal, ensuring proper synchronization between data and the data strobe signal in high-speed memory interfaces."
