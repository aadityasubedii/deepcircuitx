    "block_comment": "The block monitors the `instr_mode_i` signal to ensure the instruction mode is valid when being used with \"VIRTEX6\" family hardware. When the `instr_mode_i` signal exceeds 2 and the hardware family is \"VIRTEX6\", this non-synthesizable block prints an execution-time error message and halts further simulation. The check is performed whenever `instr_mode_i` changes, implying that the represented system is sensitive to instruction mode changes."
