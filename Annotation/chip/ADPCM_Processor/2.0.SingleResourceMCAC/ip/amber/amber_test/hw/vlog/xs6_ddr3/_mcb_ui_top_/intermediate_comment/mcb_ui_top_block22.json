    "block_comment": "The function 'blso' is a Verilog code block that performs a bitwise rotation operation on a 18-bit input 'a'. It takes this input along with two integer parameters namely 'shift' and 'width', and returns an 18-bit output. Internally, the function calculates the shift value 's' and the width 'w' using the input parameters. It then initializes 'blso' to a zero value. Through a for loop that runs 'w' times, the function cyclically shifts the bits of input 'a' to the right by 's' places, wrapping the bits around to the beginning as needed, and assigns the result to 'blso'."
