This block of Verilog code is used to monitor the change in `dm_in[15]` signal and invokes the `dm_timing_check(15)` function whenever the signal changes. It utilizes an `always @` block to track the changes of the specified bit (15 in this case) in the `dm_in` data bus. Every time that bit changes, the function `dm_timing_check` is called with the argument 15. This provides a timing check that corresponds to the 15th bit of the input data bus.
