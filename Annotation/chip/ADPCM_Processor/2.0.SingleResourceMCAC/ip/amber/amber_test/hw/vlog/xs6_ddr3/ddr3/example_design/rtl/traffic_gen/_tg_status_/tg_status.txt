Module-level comment: The 'tg_status' module logs and manages system error status. It monitors 'data_error_i' and captures system state, including data and address comparisons for debugging. Operation is synced with the rising clock edge with a delay ('TCQ'). Inputs handle triggering resets and error detection while outputs flag error occurrence and provide captured status. Internally, signals latch error state and flag error detection. On reset signal, error log is cleared; else, on new error, system status is captured.
