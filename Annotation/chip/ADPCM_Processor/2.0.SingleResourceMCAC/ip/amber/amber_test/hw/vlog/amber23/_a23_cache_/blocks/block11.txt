This block of code handles source selection. It is implemented using a wire named xSOURCE_SEL that stores the currently selected source from various options such as C_CORE, C_INIT, C_FILL, C_INVA. The selected source is determined by the boolean condition of source_sel variable. When one of these sources has a true value, its associated string literal is assigned to xSOURCE_SEL, otherwise, "UNKNOWN" is assigned.
