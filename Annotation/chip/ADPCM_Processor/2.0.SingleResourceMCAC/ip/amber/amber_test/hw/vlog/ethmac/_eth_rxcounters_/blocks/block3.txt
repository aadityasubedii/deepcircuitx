Comment: 
This block of Verilog code defines a synchronous reset and incremental operation for the 5-bit signal 'IFGCounter'. The reset takes precedence and sets the counter to zero, this is handled at the positive edge of master reset signal or clock signal events. If 'Reset' is not asserted, then the block checks if 'ResetIFGCounter' is active, if it is, then 'IFGCounter' gets zeroed. If not, it checks 'IncrementIFGCounter'. If 'IncrementIFGCounter' is active, it increments 'IFGCounter' by 1; otherwise, the state of 'IFGCounter' remains the same.
