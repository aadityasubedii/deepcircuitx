    "module": "Module-level comment: The `a25_wishbone_buf` module is a Wishbone protocol buffer which handles read and write requests. It uses synchronized operations with clock signal 'clk' and allows state reset with 'reset'. Inputs include read/write request and data signals and outputs RSVP with acknowledgments via 'o_ack' and 'o_valid'. It uses internal signals for buffer management, request acknowledgment and read/write pointers to store data in buffer. The 'always' blocks conduct the buffer operation, resetting, and data read/write operations. Conditional assignments manage outputs based on buffer state."
