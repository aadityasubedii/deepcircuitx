    "block_comment": "This block of code performs mathematical calculations on various terms and updates their values, sets a state variable, and prepares the application for a broadcast start. It uses a user-defined function \"Mult_Divide()\" to perform multiplications and divisions on the terms P_Term and N_Term with respective multiplication (MULT_S, MULT_W) and division (DIV_S, DIV_W) terms. After calculation, it assigns the new values to the terms combined with subscripts 's' and 'w'. The original P_Term and N_Term are also updated with newly calculated values in the same way. The final line sets the state to \"WAIT_FOR_START_BROADCAST\", indicating that the application is ready to receive a broadcast."
