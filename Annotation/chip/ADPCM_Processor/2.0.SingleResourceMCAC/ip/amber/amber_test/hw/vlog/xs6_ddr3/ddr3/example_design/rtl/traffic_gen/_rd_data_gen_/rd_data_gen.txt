Module-level comment: The rd_data_gen is a configurable read data generator for SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 FPGA families. It receives inputs like clock, reset, seed for pseudorandom binary sequence, data mode, command validity, fixed data, address, burst length, data readiness and read metadata enable signal. It also provides outputs like command readiness, last word in data burst, user burst count status, data validity and data. Workflow is managed by internal signals like cmd_start, data registers (adata, hdata etc), cmd_rdy and user_burst_cnt while distinct blocks manage initialization, data generation specific to FPGA family, signal handling and burst operation.
