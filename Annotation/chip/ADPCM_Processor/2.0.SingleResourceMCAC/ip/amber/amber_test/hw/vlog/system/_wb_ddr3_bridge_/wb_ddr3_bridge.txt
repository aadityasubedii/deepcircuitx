Module-level comment: The `wb_ddr3_bridge` module serves as an interface between a wishbone bus and a DDR3 memory module. It translates wishbone read and write commands into the DDR3 protocol format. Inputs control the operation type and target memory address, and outputs signal successful completion and operation results. Internally, signals control the status and execution of operations. Preprocessor directives allow for debug information output and FPGA target-dependent behavior. Additionally, the module manages FIFOs to effectively handle command executions.
