Module-level comment: The 'a25_shifter' module performs shift operations (LSL, LSR, ASR, ROR) on a 32-bit 'i_in' signal using inputs 'i_carry_in', 'i_shift_amount', 'i_shift_imm_zero', and 'i_function'. The FULL_BARREL parameter switches between full coverage or selected shift amounts for quicker operations. The result and carry out of shift operations are stored in 'o_out' and 'o_carry_out'. Internally, four 33-bit signals store the result of each operation. The code structure includes specific blocks for each operation conditional on FULL_BARREL, and the final output is routed based on 'i_function'.
