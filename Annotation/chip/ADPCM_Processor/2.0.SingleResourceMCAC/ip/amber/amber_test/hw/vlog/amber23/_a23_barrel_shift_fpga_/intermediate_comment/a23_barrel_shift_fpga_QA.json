Supported operations include logical shift left (LSL), logical shift right (LSR), arithmetic shift right (ASR), and rotate right (ROR). The specific operation is determined by the 'i_function' input, and the shift magnitude is given by the 'i_shift_amount' input. This module helps in implementing the shift and rotate functionality which is a crucial part of many digital circuits including processors and data handling/logic circuits. It would be used in operations such as multiplication, division, and data manipulation tasks within a digital system. It also provides a carry out output for subsequent chaining of shift operations. This module includes generation of respective masks for LSL and LSR operations and routing logic for implementing shifts and rotations. Functions for wrapping and bit swapping are also implemented for operational purposes."
