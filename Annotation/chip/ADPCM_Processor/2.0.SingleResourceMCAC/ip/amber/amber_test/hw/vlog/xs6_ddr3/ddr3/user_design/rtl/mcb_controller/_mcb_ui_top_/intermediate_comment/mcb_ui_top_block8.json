    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is used for interfacing with an AXI bus and a memory controller bus (MCB). It helps synchronize data transfer between the two buses and manage the data traffic. In the initial assignments, the block simply relays incoming signals to respective outputs. In the 'else' block, it uses p3_arb_en to enable or disable the arbitration and masks the AXI address with a predefined mask. The code implements synchronization using mcb_ui_top_synch instance which syncs the calibration done signal with system clock (s3_axi_aclk). It also declares and instanciates an axi_mcb module with certain parameter configurations to manage data transfer operation such as read, write between MCB and AXI. Inputs and outputs of this module are assigned to either AXI or MCB signals, ensuring proper communication between the two buses."
