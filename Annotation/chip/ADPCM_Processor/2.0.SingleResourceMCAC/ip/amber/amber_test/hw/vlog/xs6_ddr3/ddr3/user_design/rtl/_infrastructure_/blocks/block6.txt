Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages a flag related to the locking status of a phase-locked loop (PLL) during power up. With every positive edge of the provided system clock or system reset, the block evaluates if a system reset is ongoing in which case, it resets the flag `powerup_pll_locked` to 0 indicating the PLL is not locked. If there is no system reset and the buffered PLL indicates a locked status (`bufpll_mcb_locked`), then it sets `powerup_pll_locked` to 1, indicating that the PLL is locked.
