    "module": "Module-level comment: This is the 'infrastructure' module that generates various clock and reset signals for a digital system. It uses differential/single-ended system clock inputs to produce clocks of different frequencies/phases via a parametrizable PLL and buffer components. Internal signals and synchronization logic ensure coherency. The module offers adjustable reset characteristics. It's specifically used for system initialization and timing control."
