    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for triggering a specific function, cmd_addr_timing_check, based on specific changes to the addr_in signal. More specifically, the function cmd_addr_timing_check with parameter 10 is invoked whenever there is a change in the 4th bit (since index starts from 0) of addr_in. The implementation leverages the always @ construct in Verilog to constantly monitor changes in the aforementioned addr_in bit and initiate the function accordingly."
