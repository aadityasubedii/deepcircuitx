This block is responsible for synchronizing the start frame of a received signal in a design. Whenever there's a rising edge in the system's clock (WB_CLK_I) or a high Reset signal, this code snippet gets activated. If Reset is high, it implies the system is in a reset state, thereby initializing `SyncRxStartFrm_q` to zero, emulating a clear or reset functionality. If not reset, `SyncRxStartFrm_q` will be updated to the value of `SyncRxStartFrm` (presumably another register), following the system's timing requirements symbolized by `#Tp` noticing propagation delay.
