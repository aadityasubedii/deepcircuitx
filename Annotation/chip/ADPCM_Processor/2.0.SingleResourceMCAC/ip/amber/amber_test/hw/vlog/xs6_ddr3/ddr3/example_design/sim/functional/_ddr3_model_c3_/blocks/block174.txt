This block of Verilog RTL code is designed to function as a monitoring system for error detection. The block constantly checks for and displays errors related to timing violations with the 'CKE' signal, specifically 'tIH' (Input Hold Time) and 'tIPW' (Input Pulse Width) violations. The module achieves this by always triggering on the positive edge of the clock. When the reset signal 'rst_n_in' is high, it sequentially checks if 'tIH' and 'tIPW' timing constraints are met, using the time function '$time' for calculation. On violation, the module displays a respective error message with details of the violation occurred. The variable 'tm_cke' is updated as the system time for every clock cycle for later calculations.
