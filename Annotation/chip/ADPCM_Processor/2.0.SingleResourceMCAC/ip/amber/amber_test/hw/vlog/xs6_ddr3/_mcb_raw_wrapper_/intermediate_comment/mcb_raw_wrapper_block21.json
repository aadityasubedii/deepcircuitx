    "block_comment": "This block is an instantiation of an OSERDES2 module which serves as a parallel-to-serial converter in the design. Commonly found in FPGA designs, it particularly helps in increasing the data rate of the data path. The module is setup with a 2-bit data width for parallel data input. For inputs, the synchronous parallel data (dqpum and dqnum) and write enables (dqIO_w_en_0) are used. The output is managed via 'udm_oq' for data and 'udm_t' for tristate control. The module operates synchronously with respect to the provided clock signal 'ioclk90' and is enabled via 'pll_ce_90'. The shift outputs and inputs are kept unconnected in the current design. The bypass flag is set as true and reset is controlled by 'int_sys_rst'."
