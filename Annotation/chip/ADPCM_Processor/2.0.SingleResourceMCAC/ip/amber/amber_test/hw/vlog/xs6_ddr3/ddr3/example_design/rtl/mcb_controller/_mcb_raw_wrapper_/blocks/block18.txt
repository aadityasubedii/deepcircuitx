This block is responsible for generating a set of double-data-rate Output Serializer/Deserializer (OSERDES) modules corresponding to each Data-Query (DQ) pin. For a defined number of DQ pins (`C_NUM_DQ_PINS`), an OSERDES2 instance is generated with specific configuration parameters, output mode set to single-ended and used in MASTER mode. Output and tristate signals (`.OQ`, `.TQ`) for each instance are directed to corresponding DQ pin arrays. The same write-enable signal is used for both `.T1` and `.T2` while the default '0' state is set for the rest. Input data is fed through `.D1` and `.D2` while unused data pin states are set to '0'. Clock and control signals (`.CLK0`, `.IOCE`, `.TCE`) are shared among instances while retaining the capability to reset with `int_sys_rst`. Unused shift input and output signals are set to '0'. Finally, training pattern is enabled with `ioi_drp_train`.
