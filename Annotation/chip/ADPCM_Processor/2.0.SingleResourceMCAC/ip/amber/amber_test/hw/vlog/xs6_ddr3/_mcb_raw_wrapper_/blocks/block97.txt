This Verilog block maps memory addresses to row, column, and bank addresses based on various memory configuration parameters. Depending on the configuration, the block picks out relevant bits from the byte address, and if necessary, fills the rest with zeros. There are two conditional blocks determined by the C_MEM_ADDR_ORDER and C_NUM_DQ_PINS flags. The config parameters for memory includes address width, bank address width, number of column bits, and port configuration, which play an important role in determining the assignments. It handles four address inputs (p0_cmd_byte_addr, p1_cmd_byte_addr, p2_cmd_byte_addr, p3_cmd_byte_addr) and two additional ones (p4_cmd_byte_addr, p5_cmd_byte_addr) based on certain port configurations.
