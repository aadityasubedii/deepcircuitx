    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a burst read data shift register for use in a system with a wishbone interface. This operation is triggered on the rising edge of the system clock, 'i_clk'. For every clock cycle, a check is made to ensure that the wishbone bus is not being stalled, as indicated by 'i_wb_stall' being low. If not stalled, the module concatenates the new 32-bit input data, 'i_wb_read_data', to the existing burst read data, shifting out the oldest 32-bit input in the burst."
