    "block_comment": "The block primarily manages state transitions for memory control in Ultra Deep Quiescent State (UDQS). It handles the transitioning of states between 'upholding p termination wait' and 'writing n termination', based on the readiness status of the Memory Control Block (MCB). When the MCB is not ready, the state remains in the 'UDQS_PIN_P_TERM_WAIT' waiting state. However, when the MCB is ready, it transitions to the 'UDQS_PIN_WRITE_N_TERM' state, where it sets up various control and data registers for write operation, such as 'IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR', 'IODRPCTRLR_R_WB', 'IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA', and 'MCB_UIADDR'. The signal 'MCB_CMD_VALID' is also asserted high to validate the command."
