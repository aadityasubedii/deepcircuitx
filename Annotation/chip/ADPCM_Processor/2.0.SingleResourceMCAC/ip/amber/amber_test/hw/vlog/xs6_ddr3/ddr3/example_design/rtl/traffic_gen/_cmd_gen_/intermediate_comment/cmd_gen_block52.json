    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is handling the validation of a specific command based on a clock signal. At each positive edge of the incoming clock signal 'clk_i', the command validity 'cmd_vld' is updated with a delay implemented through the '#TCQ' system task. Its operation relies on two conditions, either 'cmd_clk_en' is true, which might indicate that command clock is enabled, or a mode loading pulse happens for the first time, as suggested by the conjunction of 'mode_load_pulse' and 'first_load_pulse'."
