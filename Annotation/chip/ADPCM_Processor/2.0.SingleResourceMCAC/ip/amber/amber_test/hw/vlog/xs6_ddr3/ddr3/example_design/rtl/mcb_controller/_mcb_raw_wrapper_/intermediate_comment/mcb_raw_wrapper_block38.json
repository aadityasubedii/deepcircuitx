    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a counter that resets after reaching a specific threshold. Upon the occurrence of a rising edge of either ui_clk or int_sys_rst, the counter reset or increment actions occur. If a system reset (int_sys_rst) appears, the counter resets to zero. If no reset signal is detected, it checks whether the 16th bit (15th index) of `wait_200us_counter` is high. If it is high, the counter holds its current value, otherwise, it increments by one."
