This block is responsible for generating a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS). It achieves this by using a module (cmd_prbs_gen) with predefined parameters, such as clock cycle (TCQ), chip family (FAMILY), PRBS command type (BLEN), address width (32), seed width (15), and PRBS width (20). The PRBS generation is triggered when the command pattern (CMD_PATTERN) is either "CGEN_PRBS" or "CGEN_ALL". It also takes some inputs which include the initial seed (prbs_seed_init), seed input (prbs_seed_i), and output PRBS value (prbs_o). The module is selectively activated by a clock enable signal (cmd_clk_en).
