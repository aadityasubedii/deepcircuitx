    "block_comment": "This Verilog block handles logic shift right (LSR) operations with different control paths for full shift (FULL_BARREL) or partial shift. The barrel shifter performs bitwise shifts on a 32-bit input depending on the shift amount specified. In full shift mode, the block can shift up to 32 bits, returning the shifted input concatenated with zeros in the least significant bits. In partial shift mode, the control signals decrease to a 4-way branching sequence of conditional shifts of up to 3 bits only."
