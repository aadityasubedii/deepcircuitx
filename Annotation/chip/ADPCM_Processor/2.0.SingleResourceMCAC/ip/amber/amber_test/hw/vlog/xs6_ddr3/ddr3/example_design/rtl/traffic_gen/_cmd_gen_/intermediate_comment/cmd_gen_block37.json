    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles load mode register and load mode latches for a circuit under the activation of a clock signal. It achieves this through an always block that triggers at the positive edge of the clock input signal. If 'mode_load_pulse' is True, the 'bl_mode_reg' gets the value of 'bl_mode_i' with a delay of #TCQ time units. In subsequent two cycles (given by 'mode_load_d1' and 'mode_load_d2'), the 'mode_load_i' input is latched and transferred with a delay of #TCQ time units each, thus creating a two-cycle delay for 'mode_load_i'."
