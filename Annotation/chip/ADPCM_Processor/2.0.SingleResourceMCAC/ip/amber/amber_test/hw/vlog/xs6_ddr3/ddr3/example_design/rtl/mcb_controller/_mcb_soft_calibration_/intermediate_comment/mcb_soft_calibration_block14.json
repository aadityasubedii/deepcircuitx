    "block_comment": "The code block primarily sets up a write operation for the UDQS signal with a negative delay in an integrated circuit memory design. It sets register and memory control parameters to initialize the write operation. It assigns a negative edge delay address to the memory cell address, sets the mode to write, and assigns an initial delay to the write data. The user address is set for UDQS clock, and a command validation trigger is turned on. Depending on the state of the 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N' flag (signifying system readiness), the operational state either loops in the current state until the system is available, or transitions to a 'UDQS_WAIT2' state."
