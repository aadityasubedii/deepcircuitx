    "block_comment": "This block of code carries out timing checks for negative edge cases of a signal. Specifically, it monitors for negative edge cases within `dqs_in[24]`, a 25-bit data quick switch (DQS) input signal, and when such an event occurs, it triggers the `dqs_pos_timing_check` procedure with 24 as an argument. The `dqs_pos_timing_check` procedure hence initiates the post-layout positive edge timing verification for the DQS signal to ensure reliable operation."
