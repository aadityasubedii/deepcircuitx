Comment: 
This block generates IO buffer circuits for each data quantum (DQ) pin in a memory controller block (MCB). The number of generated circuits is controlled by the parameter `C_NUM_DQ_PINS`. Each iteration of the loop creates an instance of the `IOBUF` module with the current DQ pin designated as its input-output (`IO`). The other three parameters (`I`, `T`, `O`) are also fed with their respective values.
