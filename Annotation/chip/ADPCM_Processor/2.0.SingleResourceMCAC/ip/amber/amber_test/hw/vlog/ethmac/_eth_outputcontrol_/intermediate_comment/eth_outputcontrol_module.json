    "module": "Module-level comment: The eth_outputcontrol module manages output control operations in an Ethernet MAC context, specifically controlling Mdo and MdoEn signals based on clock or reset events. The module uses various input ports such as Clk, Reset, WriteOp, NoPre, InProgress, ShiftedBit, BitCounter, and MdcEn_n. The output ports are Mdo and MdoEn. Internally, signals like SerialEn, MdoEn_2d & MdoEn_d, and Mdo_2d & Mdo_d are used for sequential and synchronizing operations. The logic within the module is designed to consistently update and control the output sequence based on these inputs and internal signals."
