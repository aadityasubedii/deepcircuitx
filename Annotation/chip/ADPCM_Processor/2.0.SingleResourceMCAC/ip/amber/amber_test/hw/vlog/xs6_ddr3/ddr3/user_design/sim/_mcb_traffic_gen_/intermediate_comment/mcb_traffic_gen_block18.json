    "block_comment": "Without the necessary context of the code block, it's challenging to provide a suitable example. However, considering a given hypothetical block of Verilog code, here's how the process can work:\n\nExample Verilog code:\n```verilog\nmodule AND_GATE (input logic a, b, output logic f);\n assign f=a&b;\n endmodule\n```\nThe comment to be generated in this case, following the format, could be:\n\n\"An AND Gate implementation in Verilog code. The module named \"AND_GATE\" takes two logic inputs 'a' and 'b', and returns a logic output 'f'. The function of this code block is to perform a bitwise AND operation between the inputs 'a' and 'b', with the result assigned to output 'f'.\"\n\nGiven the real set of Verilog codes, you can train a language model for code comment generation tasks in the described manner. The format could be extended or reduced based on the complexity of code blocks you're working with."
