    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to map DQ line errors and update a cumulative error state based on instant and past errors. A for loop is iteratively run for each DQ line (from 0 to DQ_ERROR_WIDTH) to bind each dq_lane_error[i] to the logical OR operation performed on a set of related elements from the error_byte_r1 array. This effectively captures all errors pertaining to that DQ lane. Similarly, each cumulative DQ line error bit, cumlative_dq_lane_error_c[i], is updated by logically ORing the instant DQ line error (dq_lane_error_r1[i]) with the previous cumulative error state (cumlative_dq_lane_error_r[i]). This design enables effective tracking and reporting of error states in DQ lines."
