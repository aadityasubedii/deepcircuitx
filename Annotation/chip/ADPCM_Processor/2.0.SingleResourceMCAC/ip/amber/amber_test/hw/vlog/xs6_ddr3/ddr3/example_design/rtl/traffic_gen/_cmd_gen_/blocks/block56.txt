Comment: 
This block is a clock-based control for a signal, `first_load_pulse`. Upon a rising edge of the clock signal, if the least significant bit of `rst_i` is 1, then `first_load_pulse` is set high, introducing a slight delay defined by #TCQ. Otherwise, if `mode_load_pulse` is true, `first_load_pulse` is set to low with the same delay. If neither condition is met, the `first_load_pulse` signal retains its prior state.
