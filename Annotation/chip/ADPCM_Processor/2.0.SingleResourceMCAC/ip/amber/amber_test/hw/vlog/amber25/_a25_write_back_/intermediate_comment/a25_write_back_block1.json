    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a flip-flop with reset and clock sensitivity for the purpose of latching a data address. Upon a positive edge detection of the reset signal, the block assigns the `daddress_r` a value of zero, effectively resetting the latch. When the reset is not active and upon detection of a positive edge of the `clk` signal and `i_mem_stall` not occurring, the input data address `i_daddress` is latched and saved into `daddress_r` for future cycles until another positive edge is detected on the clk signal. With this structure, the location of memory addresses can be safely handled and updated."
