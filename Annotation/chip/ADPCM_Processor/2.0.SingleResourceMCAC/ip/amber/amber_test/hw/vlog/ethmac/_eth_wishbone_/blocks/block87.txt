Comment: 
This block of code manages the state of the `TxDonePacketBlocked` signal in a network transmitter. It operates synchronously with either a rising edge of `WB_CLK_I` or a high `Reset` signal. During a reset condition, `TxDonePacketBlocked` is set to binary zero with delay `#Tp`. If reset is not asserted and `TxDone_wb` is low while `TxDone_wb_q` is high, `TxDonePacketBlocked` is also set to zero. Alternatively, if `TxDonePacket` is high, `TxDonePacketBlocked` is set to binary one. These signal changes occur after a delay denoted by `#Tp`. This manipulation of `TxDonePacketBlocked` helps in controlling the packet transmission process based on varying conditions.
