Comment: 
This one-line Verilog code snippet is focused on a signal assignment, associating the signal 'rdy_busy_n' with a state comparison. This line assigns the output signal 'rdy_busy_n' based on the current state of the system. The 'rdy_busy_n' signal is asserted '1' when the state of the system is 'READY', otherwise, it is '0'. This can be used to indicate externally whether the system is ready or busy in a state machine setting.
