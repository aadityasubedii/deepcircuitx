    "block_comment": "The given block of code enables Port 3 if a specific control line (C_PORT_ENABLE[3]) is set to 1. It then assigns a 32-bit comparison data (cmp_data) from Port 3 (p3_cmp_data[31:0]). The functionality of the block relies on the condition of C_PORT_ENABLE[3], showcasing how the data from different ports can be selected and processed depending on control signals. This demonstrates Verilog's conditional structuring and bit manipulation capabilities."
