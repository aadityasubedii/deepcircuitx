    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is involved in the operation of various memory interface generator (MIG) operations and user-interface modes. The primary activities handled by the code include assigning MIG command accesses, enabling/disabling various interface modes, and handling read/write operations. The code is divided into different conditional sections, which depend on port configurations and enable signals. This facilitates the handling of data read and write operations, error management, and command queries between different components of the system. The implementation leverages the `assign` statement to route data and control signals between different MIGs, switching them on and off based on the conditions specified. This concise approach also facilitates efficient updating of data and status flags, ensuring appropriate system responses to different operational states."
