Comment: 
This block manages the transmission completion signal in a communication system. When either the `MTxClk` clock signal rises or the system is reset, this block is evaluated. On a system reset, `TxDone` is set to 0. Otherwise, if a new transmission frame is started and the status is not latched, `TxDone` is also reset to 0. Finally, if the transmission is completed, `TxDone` is set to 1. The delay of `Tp` ensures synchronization in changing `TxDone` status.
