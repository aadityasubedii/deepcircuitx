    "block_comment": "The block of code generates an interrupt signal based on specific conditions. The interrupt signal is activated when the 'next_interrupt' value is not equal to 0, 6, or 7, and when there is no conflict present. This is achieved using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog, which continuously drives the 'interrupt' signal as per the logic defined."
