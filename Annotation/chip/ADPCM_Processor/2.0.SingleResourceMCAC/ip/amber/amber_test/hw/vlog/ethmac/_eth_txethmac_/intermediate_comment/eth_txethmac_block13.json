    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block is designed to manage a retry count mechanism under various conditions, working under either a master transmit clock or a reset signal. Upon receiving a reset signal, the retry count (RetryCnt[3:0]) is reset to zero. When different events occur like having an excessive defer, an underrun, a too big event, start transmit done event, a transmit underrun, or when there is a signal jam at the seventh nibble (~ColWindow | RetryMax), the retry count is again reset to zero. Meanwhile, if there is a signal jam at the seventh nibble and in the collision window, and it is either not a back-off situation or the random value equals to zero (RandomEq0 | NoBckof), or when there is a back-off state and the random value equals the byte count, the retry count is increased by one."
