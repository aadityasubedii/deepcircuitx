Comment: 
This block is responsible for performing a timing check when a positive edge is detected in the 27th bit of the `dqs_in` array. It accomplishes this through usage of the `always @` construct that triggers on positive edge changes, specifically on the 27th bit of `dqs_in`. When such change occurs, the `dqs_neg_timing_check` function is called with the integer argument 26, presumably correlating with the index of the bit that just experienced the positive edge change.
