    "block_comment": "The block of code describes a state machine operating in 'WAIT5' state, chiefly awaiting the 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N' and 'First_In_Term_Done' signals. If 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N' is not asserted, it remains in the 'WAIT5' state. However, when 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N' is high and 'First_In_Term_Done' is also triggered, it checks the 'MCB_UOREFRSHFLAG' and if it is set, it updates the 'MCB_UIDRPUPDATE' signal, while simultaneously comparing the present 'N_Term' with its previous value. If there's a mismatch, 'N_Term_Prev' is updated and the state is transitioned to 'BROADCAST_NTERM'. If 'N_Term' is equal to 'N_Term_Prev', it switches to 'OFF_RZQ_PTERM' state. Without the 'MCB_UOREFRSHFLAG', the state remains 'WAIT5'."
