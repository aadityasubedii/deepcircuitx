Comment: 
This block of Verilog code assists in determining if a write enable condition occurs for a specified data way. It utilizes a combination of signals to accomplish this; if the source select is set to fill and the chosen way is active, or if a write hit, a data hit in the way indexed 'i', and cache state being idle all occur simultaneously, this statement will generate a true (1) value for `data_wenable_way[i]`. This either triggers a write operation into the cache way in the case of a hit, or it determines which cache way gets updated during a fill operation.
