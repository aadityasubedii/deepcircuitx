    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code serves as a configuration and control interface for a data port (port 2). The block checks the configuration setting for the port size, and if it matches \"B32\" for write size and \"R32\" for read size, it activates the relevant data lines for reading operation. If port 2 is enabled, it assigns respective lines for clock, read data, enable signal, overflow, error, fill status, and count from related 'mig_p2_' signals. If port 2 is not enabled, it zeroes out all these values to prevent undesired operations. For write data of mig_p2_wr_data, it is always assigned as zero, indicating no write operation is performed in this scope."
