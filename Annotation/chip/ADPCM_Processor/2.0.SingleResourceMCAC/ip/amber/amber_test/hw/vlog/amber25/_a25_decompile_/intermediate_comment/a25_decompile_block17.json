    "block_comment": "The task `codtrans_args` primarily functions to write certain portions of the execute instruction to a file, specifically the bits from 8th to 11th and 12th to 15th. It also calls `warmreg` function passing `reg_n` as an argument. To achieve its function, the task uses `$fwrite` function for writing to `decompile_file`. It writes the 8th to 11th bits first, followed by the 12th to 15th bits of the `execute_instruction`, each followed by a comma for separation. The `warmreg` function is then called with `reg_n` as an argument."
