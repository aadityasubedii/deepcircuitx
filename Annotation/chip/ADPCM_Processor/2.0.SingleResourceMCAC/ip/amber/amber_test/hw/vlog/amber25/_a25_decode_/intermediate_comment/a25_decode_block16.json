    "block_comment": "This block of code is part of a control system in a Verilog module, specifically controlling a multiplication process, denoted as 'MULT_PROC1'. This block instructs the system to pre-fetch the next instruction and indicate the multiplication function as the current operation. The process is prompted if the control state is in 'MULT_PROC1', an instruction execution is happening, and there's no conflict in the process. The pre-fetching is enabled by setting 'pre_fetch_instruction_wen' to '1'd1', and the program counter write-enable-next (pc_wen_nxt) is reset to '1'd0'. The next multiplication function is set as the current operation by setting 'multiply_function_nxt' equal to the output of the multiplication function 'o_multiply_function'."
