    "block_comment": "This block deals with the assignment of byte address, row address and column address to two different commands, p4_cmd and p5_cmd, based on memory configurations. If a specific port configuration is matched, the block checks if certain memory parameters (C_MEM_BANKADDR_WIDTH, C_MEM_ADDR_WIDTH, C_MEM_NUM_COL_BITS) meet specific conditions. If these parameters match the conditions, they are directly assigned to command addresses. Otherwise, a bitwise concatenation occurs using 'allzero', effectively prefixing zeroes to the command addresses. This block caters to different memory configurations by dynamically assigning parts of the address width to appropriate ranges of the command byte addresses."
