    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is responsible for a synchronous reset and data update in a hardware design. This block primarily responds to two clock-edge triggers: when a reset is triggered, it initializes 'count', 'product', and 'o_done' to zero. When a positive clock edge is detected and 'i_core_stall' is not active, it conditionally updates the value of 'count', 'product', and 'o_done'. The specific updates depend on whether 'i_execute' is high. 'Count' and 'product' are updated with new values ('count_nxt' and 'product_nxt'), while 'o_done' is updated according to whether the 'count' has reached 31 (using 6-bit decimal representation) or keeps its previous state."
