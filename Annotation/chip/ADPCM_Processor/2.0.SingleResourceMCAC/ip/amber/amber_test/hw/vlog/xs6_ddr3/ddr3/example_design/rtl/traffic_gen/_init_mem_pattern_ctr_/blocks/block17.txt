This block of code is an always block that is activated at the positive edge of the input clock signal. The main function of this code block is to calculate the end address boundary for some memory or register operation. In terms of implementation, the end address boundary calculation happens by subtracting the memory width in bytes (DWIDTH/8) from END_ADDRESS and then adding 1. This newly calculated result is then assigned to the end_boundary_addr in every clock cycle. This calculation presumably helps ensure that memory access stays within the designated boundaries.
