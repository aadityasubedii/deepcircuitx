    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the pull-up and pull-down resistors for the upper data strobe line (UDQS) of the memory controller block depending on the type of memory and configuration settings. If the memory is DDR or MDDR or if it's DDR2 with no differential DQS enabled and 16 DQ pins are used, it only generates a pull-down resistor for UDQS. In case of other memory types with 16 DQ pins, it generates both pull-up and pull-down resistors for UDQS line. The upper data strobe line helps in data read and write operations on the memory interface."
