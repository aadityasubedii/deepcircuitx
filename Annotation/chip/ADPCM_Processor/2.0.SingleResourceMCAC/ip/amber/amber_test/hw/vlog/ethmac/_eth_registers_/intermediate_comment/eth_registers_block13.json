    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing the SetRxCIrq signal based on clock (Clk) or reset (Reset) conditions. Whenever a positive edge (rising signal) is detected on either of the Clk or Reset lines, the block gets activated. If the Reset signal is set, it immediately synchronously resets the SetRxCIrq signal by setting it to zero. However, in the absence of a Reset condition, it assigns the AND operation result of the signals SetRxCIrq_sync2 and the negation of SetRxCIrq_sync3 to SetRxCIrq signal, effectively sequencing or pipelining synchronization to avoid any metastability. This occurs asynchronously to ensure synchronization with the system clock."
