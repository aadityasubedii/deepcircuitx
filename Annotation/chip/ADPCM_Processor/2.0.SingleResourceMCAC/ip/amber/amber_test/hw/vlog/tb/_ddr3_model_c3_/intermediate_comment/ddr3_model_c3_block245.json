    "block_comment": "The given block of code in the Verilog RTL is implementing a delay function. Specifically, it is delaying the input signal 'cke' by a stipulated number of time units defined by the macro 'BUS_DELAY', and outputting the signal as 'cke_in'. This delay is enforced everytime there is a change in the state of the 'cke' input. The delay is typically used to mimic physical characteristics of a line driver or other hardware components, enabling realistic simulation of circuit behaviour."
