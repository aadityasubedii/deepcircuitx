    "block_comment": "The block of code provides functionality to write a decompiled version of executed instructions into a file. Upon a positive edge clock signal, if the 'execute_now' signal is high, it checks if an interrupt has occurred (values 0 or 7). If so, the specific memory address of the execution and corresponding instruction is noted down into 'decompile_file'. It further details conditions associated with the instruction type, such as Machine Translation, Register Operations, Multiplication, System Calls, and others. Based on these conditions, it appends characters to distinguish them. Additionally, it takes care of spacing and padding for proper alignment of output in the file. If an undefined or SWI instruction is encountered during execution, the processor state at that point along with the return address is recorded."
