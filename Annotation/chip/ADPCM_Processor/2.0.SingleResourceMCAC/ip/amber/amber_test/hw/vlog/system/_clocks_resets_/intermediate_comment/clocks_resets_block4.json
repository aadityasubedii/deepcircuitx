    "block_comment": "The provided block of code functions to calculate the clock period for the board and the PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) clock. At the initial run-time, the current time in simulation is captured at the rising edge of the board clock and stored in 'brd_temp'. On the next rising edge of the board clock, the time that has elapsed since the preceding rising edge (i.e., the board's clock period) is calculated by subtracting 'brd_temp' from the current simulation time. The PLL clock period is then determined by dividing the board clock period by four."
