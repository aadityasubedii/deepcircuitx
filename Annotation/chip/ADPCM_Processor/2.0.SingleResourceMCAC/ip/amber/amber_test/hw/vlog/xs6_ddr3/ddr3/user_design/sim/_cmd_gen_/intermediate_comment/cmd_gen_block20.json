    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to create a clock-enabled command signal based on the rising edge of the input clock. It waits for a positive edge transition on the clk_i signal, and then, after a delay specified by the constant TCQ, assigns the current value of cmd_clk_en to cmd_clk_en_r. This kind of logic is often used for synchronizing signals in synchronous systems."
