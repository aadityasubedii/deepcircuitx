The given module decides the condition for data validity in a comparator circuit. If a Spartan6 family FPGA is used, it will directly assign the 'cmp_data_en' signal to 'cmp_data_valid'. However, if a Virtex6 family FPGA is used with a memory burst length of 4, 'v6_data_cmp_valid' get assigned to 'cmp_data_valid'. For any other case, 'data_valid_i' is set as the 'cmp_data_valid' signal.
