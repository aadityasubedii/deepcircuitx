Comment: 
This Verilog block acts as an interrupt handler for three timers, Timer0, Timer1 and Timer2. At every positive clock edge, the current status of each timer interrupt register is stored. If an interrupt occurs i.e., when the interrupt register's present state is high and the past state was low, then a debug message is displayed indicating which timer has initiated the interrupt.
