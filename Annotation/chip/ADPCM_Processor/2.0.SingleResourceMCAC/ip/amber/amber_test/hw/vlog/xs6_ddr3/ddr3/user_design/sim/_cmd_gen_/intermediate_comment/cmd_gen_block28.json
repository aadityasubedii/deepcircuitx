    "block_comment": "The function of this Verilog RTL block is to dynamically scale the `INC_COUNTS` signal by a factor determined by the number of data query (DQ) pins (`NUM_DQ_PINS`). The block uses a series of conditional statements to set `INC_COUNTS`, clocked with the rising edge of the `clk_i` signal, for different ranges of `NUM_DQ_PINS`. For instance, if `NUM_DQ_PINS` falls between 128 and 144, `INC_COUNTS` is set as 64 times quarter of `MEM_BURST_INT`. Similarly, for different value ranges of `NUM_DQ_PINS`, `INC_COUNTS` is set to different multiples of quarter `MEM_BURST_INT`."
