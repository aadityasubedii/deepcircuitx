Comment: 
This block of code is essentially a flip-flop that generates a differential clock signal, `diff_ck`, based on the input clock signal `ck_n_in`. This operation takes place at the rising edge of the input clock, as indicated by `@(posedge ck_n_in)`. The flip-flop inverts the input clock signal using the bit-wise negation operator (`~`), and assigns the result to the `diff_ck` output at each positive edge of the `ck_n_in` signal.
