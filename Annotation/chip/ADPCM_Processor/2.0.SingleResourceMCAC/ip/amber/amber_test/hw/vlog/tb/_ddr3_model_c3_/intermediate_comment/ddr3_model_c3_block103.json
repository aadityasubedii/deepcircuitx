    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog uses an \"always\" block to execute a timing verification function. The function, dq_timing_check, monitors the changes in bit 27 of the dq_in array. The function is triggered immediately after any change in state of dq_in's 27th bit. The goal of this block is to keep tracking the timing performance of the indicated data bit in the dq_in array."
