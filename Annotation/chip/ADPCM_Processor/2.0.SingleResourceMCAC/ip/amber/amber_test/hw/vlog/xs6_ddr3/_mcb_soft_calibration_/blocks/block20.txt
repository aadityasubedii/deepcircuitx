Comment: 
This block initiates a dynamic calibration procedure. It sets the `LastPass_DynCal` to `IN_TERM_PASS` signifying the state of the last calibration pass whilst disabling the user command enable (`MCB_UICMDEN`) and setting the calibration done flag (`MCB_UIDONECAL`). The `Pre_SYSRST` is set for a system reset. The calibration mode is then checked - if it's not equal to 'CALIBRATION', it transitions the state to `START_DYN_CAL`; else if the minimum pulse width check (`pre_sysrst_minpulse_width_ok`) passes, it moves to the `WAIT_FOR_UODONE` state.
