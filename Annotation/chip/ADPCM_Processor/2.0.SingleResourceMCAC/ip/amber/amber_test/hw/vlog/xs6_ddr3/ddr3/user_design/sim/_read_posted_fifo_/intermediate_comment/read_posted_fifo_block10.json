    "block_comment": "This block is generating a write enable signal (wr_en) for a FIFO design. The signal wr_en is assigned true when there's a valid command (cmd_valid_i), the FIFO is not full (indicated by !full), there's enough room in the data FIFO (dfifo_has_enough_room_d1), and waiting is done (signalled by wait_done). These conditions ensure safe write operations avoiding overflow, and ensuring FIFO has adequate space before a write is enabled."
