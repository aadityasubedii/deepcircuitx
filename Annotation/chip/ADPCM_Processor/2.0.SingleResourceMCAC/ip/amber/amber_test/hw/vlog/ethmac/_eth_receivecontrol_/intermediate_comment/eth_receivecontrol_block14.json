    "block_comment": "The block assigns the logic operation result to the signal `IncrementByteCnt`. The `IncrementByteCnt`  toggles when `RxValid`, `DetectionWindow` are high (true), `ByteCntEq18` is low (false), and `DlyCrcEn` is either low (false) or high (true) when `DlyCrcCnt[2]` is also high (true). Therefore, this block implements a conditional incrementing mechanism for the byte count during a valid data reception and detection window, but not when the byte count equals 18. The incrementing also takes into account a delay cyclic redundancy check (CRC) signal or a scenario where the delay CRC signal and the third bit of the delayed CRC count are high."
