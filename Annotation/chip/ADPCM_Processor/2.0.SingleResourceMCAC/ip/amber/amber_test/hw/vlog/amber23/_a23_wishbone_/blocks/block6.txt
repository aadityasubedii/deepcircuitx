This block of code is responsible for writing data to the output wire `o_wb_dat` when a certain condition is met. This function is implemented using a synchronous process, triggered on the rising edge of `i_clk`, implying that changes are synchronized with the clock signal. When the `start_access` signal is high, the data in `i_write_data` is written to `o_wb_dat`, effectively allowing for the control of write operations to `o_wb_dat`.
