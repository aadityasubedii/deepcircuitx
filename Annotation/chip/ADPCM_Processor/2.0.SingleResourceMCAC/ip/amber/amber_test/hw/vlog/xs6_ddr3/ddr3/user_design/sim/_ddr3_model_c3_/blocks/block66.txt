This block provides a timing analysis and error checking mechanism for a memory write operation, more specifically during a DDR timing mode known as Write Leveling. It monitors the control signals and timestamp for each bit of the Data Strobe (DQS) during a write operation, it checks for time violations and generates appropriate warnings or errors. If the conditions are met, it updates the DQS output enabling flag, DQS difference from clock for each part of the DQS bit and DM bits. It features multiple if conditions to check different timings like TWLMRD, TWLS, TWPRE, etc. Certain debug logs are also printed based on the system's debug status. The block also updates write preamble, postamble, and checks conditions based on the delay locked loop (DLL) locked status. To ensure proper timing, the timestamps for each DQS, DQ, and DQSS are also monitored and updated accordingly.
