Module name: cmd_gen. Module specification: The cmd_gen module is a command generator for memory interfaces, designed to generate memory commands (read, write, refresh) with various address patterns (sequential, PRBS, fixed) and burst lengths. It supports different memory types and families (Spartan-6, Virtex-6) and can be configured for different data widths and port modes. The module takes inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), run traffic signal (run_traffic_i), and various configuration parameters like address modes, data modes, and instruction modes. It outputs generated address (addr_o), instruction (instr_o), burst length (bl_o), and a command valid signal (cmd_o_vld). Internally, the module uses signals like addr_counts for sequential address generation, prbs_addr for PRBS address generation, and instr_out for instruction selection
