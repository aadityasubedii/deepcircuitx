    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for the initialization and configuration of the memory pattern controller and memory traffic generator for Port 2 if the corresponding port is enabled. The initialization is achieved by instantiating the `init_mem_pattern_ctr` module with specific settings regarding data width, address range, seeds for command and data, data mode, and port mode. Following that, the `mcb_traffic_gen` module is initiated to manipulate the overall traffic of memory commands, defining parameters like command and data patterns, and start and end address. The input and output ports of both modules are interconnected, facilitating the management of memory commands and data. If Port 2 is not enabled, it sets various error and data comparison outputs to zero."
