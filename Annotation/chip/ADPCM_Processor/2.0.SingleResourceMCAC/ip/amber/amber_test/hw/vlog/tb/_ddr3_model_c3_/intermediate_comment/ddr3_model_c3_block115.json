    "block_comment": "This block deploys a timing checking function called `dq_timing_check` on the highest bit of the `dq_in` bus. The function is set to be sensitive to the changes of the 15th bit of the `dq_in` bus, and whenever its value changes, it triggers the `dq_timing_check(15)` function. The purpose of this block is to monitor the timing performance of the most significant bit (MSB) of the `dq_in` data bus. The event-driven nature of this design ensures real-time performance monitoring and potential issue detection."
