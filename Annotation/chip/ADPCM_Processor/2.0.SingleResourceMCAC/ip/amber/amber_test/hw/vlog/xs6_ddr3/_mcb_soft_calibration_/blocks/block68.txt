Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls SELFREFRESH_MODE flag based on various conditions. Upon each positive edge of UI_CLK, the SELFREFRESH_MODE is reset to low if the RST signal is high indicating a reset state. However, if SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE_R2 is high, SELFREFRESH_MODE is set to high, marking that device is in self-refresh mode. Otherwise, if the condition WarmEnough is true, SELFREFRESH_MODE is cleared to low, indicating the device is warm enough and no longer needs to keep itself in self-refresh mode.
