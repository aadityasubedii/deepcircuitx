    "block_comment": "This block is designed to compare address ranges and update certain signals accordingly. It operates under a clock edge detection paradigm, triggering only when there's a rising edge on the 'clk_i' input. Specifically, it splits the 'addr_out' output address and 'end_addr_r' end address into 3 sections: [31:24], [23:16], and [15:8]. In each case, if 'addr_out' is greater or equal to 'end_addr_r', the corresponding signal (AC3_G_E3, AC2_G_E2, or AC1_G_E1) is set to 1. If not, the signal is set to 0. The '#TCQ' directive defines the time of the signal assignment."
