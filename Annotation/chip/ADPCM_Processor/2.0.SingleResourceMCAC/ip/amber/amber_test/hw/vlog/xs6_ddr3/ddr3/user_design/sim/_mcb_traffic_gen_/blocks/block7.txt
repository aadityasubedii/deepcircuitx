Comment: 
The code block assigns a value to the variable `rdpath_rd_data_i` based on the evaluation of a conditional expression. The assignment operation is conditioned on the `FAMILY` and `MEM_BLEN` being "VIRTEX6" and 4 respectively, in which case, `rd_v6_mdata` is assigned, else `mcb_rd_data_i` is assigned.
