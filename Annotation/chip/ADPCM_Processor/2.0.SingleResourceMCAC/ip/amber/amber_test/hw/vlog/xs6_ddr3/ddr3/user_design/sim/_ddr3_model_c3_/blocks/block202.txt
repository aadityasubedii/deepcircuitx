Comment: 
This code block initiates the `dqs_even_receiver` for the 7th bit whenever a rising edge is detected in the 7th bit of the `dqs_even` signal. The `always @(posedge dqs_even[ 6])` function triggers the execution by monitoring the positive edge of the 7th bit of `dqs_even` (since indexing starts at 0), hence it's synchronous with the rising edge of `dqs_even[ 6]`. This process is driving the `dqs_even_receiver` with the index of 6.
