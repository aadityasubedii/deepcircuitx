This Verilog block controls flags for incrementing and decrementing delay. The `Dec_Flag` gets assigned when the target DQS delay is less than the current DQS delay implying a need to reduce the delay. Conversely, the `Inc_Flag` gets assigned when the target DQS delay is greater than the current DQS delay indicating a need to increase the delay. This allows efficient, condition-specific control over data queuing synchronization, optimizing data transmission speed at runtime.
