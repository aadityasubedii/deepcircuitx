    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to handle data output with a width of 128 bits. It works by continuously monitoring various data signals including `adata`, `hdata`, `ndata`, `w1data`, `prbs_data`, and applies different modes of operation (`data_mode_i`) and fixed data input (`fixed_data_i`) depending on their states. The `if` statement within the `generate` clause enables the code to run when the data width specified (`DWIDTH`) equals 128, providing an organized way of managing the data throughput efficiently for high-bit operations."
