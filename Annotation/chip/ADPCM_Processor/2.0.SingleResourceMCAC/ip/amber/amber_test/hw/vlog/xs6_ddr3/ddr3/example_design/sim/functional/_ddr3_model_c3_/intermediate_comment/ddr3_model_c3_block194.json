    "block_comment": "This block of code is a high level model of the DQS (Data Strobe) event receiver, specifically of the even numbered DQS signal [14]. The 'always' block is triggered by the positive edge of the DQS signal, suggesting it's a edge-triggered action - often a signal read or write operation. This simplistic setup represents a portion of a memory interface where DQS signals are commonly used for indicating when data should be read from or written into a memory cell. However, without more context, exact operation cannot be determined.\n"
