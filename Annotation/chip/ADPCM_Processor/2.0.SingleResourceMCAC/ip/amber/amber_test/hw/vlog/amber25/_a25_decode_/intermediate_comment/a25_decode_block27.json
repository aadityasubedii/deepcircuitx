    "block_comment": "The block assigns the signal `und_request` based on instruction type and, in certain cases, instruction content. The `und_request` signal is set when `type` is either `CODTRANS` or `COREGOP`. It also sets `und_request` when `type` is `CORTRANS` and the 4-bit slice from the 8th to the 11th bit of `instruction` does not equal `4'd15`. The use of the bitwise equality operator and the logical OR operator easily synthesizes this multiple condition matching."
