    "block_comment": "This function, named `ceil`, calculates and returns the ceiling of a given number. The input number, which can be a fractional value, is parsed and used within the function. If the number exceeds its integer representation, the function increments the integer part by one, effectively computing its ceiling value. If not, the integer representation of the number is directly returned as the result."
