    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block performs range checking on an outgoing address (addr_out) against an end address (end_addr_i) at each rising edge of the clock signal. It checks different byte ranges (from the most significant byte to the least), sets the respective 'A_G_E' flag to 1 if 'addr_out' is greater than or equal to 'end_addr_i', and 0 otherwise. The comparison for the least significant byte range involves additional logic to account for data-width and burst length offsets. All assignments are carried out after a delay corresponding to the timing check value(TCQ)."
