Module name: v6_data_gen. Module specification: This module generates various data patterns for memory testing or simulation purposes. It supports multiple data generation modes including address-based, PRBS (Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence), walking 1/0 patterns, neighbor patterns, and fixed data patterns. The module takes inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), data mode (data_mode_i), address inputs (addr_i, m_addr_i), and control signals (cmd_startA/B/C/D/E, data_rdy_i, fifo_rdy_i). It outputs generated data (data_o) based on the selected mode and input parameters. Internally, it uses signals like prbs_data, acounts, adata, hdata, ndata, w1data, and w0data for different pattern generations. The module is divided into sections for
