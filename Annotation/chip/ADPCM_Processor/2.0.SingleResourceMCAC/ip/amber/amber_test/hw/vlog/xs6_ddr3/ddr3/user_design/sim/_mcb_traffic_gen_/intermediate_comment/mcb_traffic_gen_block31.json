    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for synchronous updates of three registers (data_mode_r_a, data_mode_r_b, data_mode_r_c) based on the input data_mode_i. The updates occur on the rising edges of the input clock signal (clk_i). The delay model (#TCQ) slows down the register update, creating a timing control for the intended delay between the rising edge of the clock and the time when the data_mode_i is captured in the registered variables."
