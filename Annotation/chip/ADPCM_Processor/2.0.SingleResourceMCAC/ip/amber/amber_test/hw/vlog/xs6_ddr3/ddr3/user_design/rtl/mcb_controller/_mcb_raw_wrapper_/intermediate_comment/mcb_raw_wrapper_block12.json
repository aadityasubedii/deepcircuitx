    "block_comment": "The block of code is a generate loop intended for instantiation of the output buffer (OBUFT), specifically done for a memory bank addressed by 'C_MEM_BANKADDR_WIDTH'. This is accomplished by incrementing the index 'ba_i' while iterating over the width of the memory address. Within each iteration, an instance of OBUFT, 'iob_ba_inst,' takes the specific bit 'ioi_ba[ba_i]' from the input signal and the 't_ba[ba_i]' from a test signal as inputs, and outputs it to 'mcbx_dram_ba[ba_i]', corresponding to the memory cell in the DRAM bank. The implementation detail thus involves the buffer's orderly instantiation for each bit of the memory bank address."
