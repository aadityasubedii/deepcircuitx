Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is used for applying a delay to reset signal 'rst_n'. It uses a non-blocking assignment in an always block, which is triggered whenever the reset signal 'rst_n' changes its state. The '#BUS_DELAY' applies a pre-defined delay to the signal, and the delayed signal value is assigned to 'rst_n_in'. This manipulation aids in synchronization across different parts of a complex digital system, preventing potential glitches caused by instant reset.
