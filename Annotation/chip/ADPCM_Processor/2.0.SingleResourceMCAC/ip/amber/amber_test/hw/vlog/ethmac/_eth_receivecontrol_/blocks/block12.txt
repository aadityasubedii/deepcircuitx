Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is checking for validity of byte counts and assigning these counts to certain variables. The block accomplishes its function by comparing the received value of 'ByteCnt' with a specific set of hexadecimal values ranging from 'h0' to 'h10'. If 'RxValid' is high and the received byte count matches any of the hexadecimal values, the respective Boolean variable (from 'ByteCntEq0' to 'ByteCntEq16') is assigned as true.
