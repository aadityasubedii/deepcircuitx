    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to conditionally assign values dependent on the Wishbone data width, particularly for two scenarios - a width of 128 and 32. For a Wishbone data width (WB_DWIDTH) of 128, it slices the input data (i_wb_dat) into four 32-bit segments based on the two least significant bits of the address (i_wb_adr), assigning the selected segment to 'wb_wdata32'. It then assigns the output data (o_wb_dat) by replicating 'wb_rdata32' four times. For the second scenario, where the Wishbone data width equals 32, it assigns the input data directly to 'wb_wdata32' while the output data directly becomes 'wb_rdata32'."
