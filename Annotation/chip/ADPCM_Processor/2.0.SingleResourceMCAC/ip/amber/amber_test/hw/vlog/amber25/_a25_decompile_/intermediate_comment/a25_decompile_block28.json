    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for configuring, mapping, and assigning specific bits of the 'execute_instruction' input to various smaller parts for further processing. The opcode, condition, and various register values such as 'reg_n', 'reg_d', and 'reg_m' are all assigned by extracting specific bit-ranges from the 'execute_instruction'. Additionally, offsets are calculated and flagged if there's no shifting operation performed. It accomplishes this via hardware bit slicing on the 'execute_instruction' data variable, using the assign keyword for continuous assignment."
