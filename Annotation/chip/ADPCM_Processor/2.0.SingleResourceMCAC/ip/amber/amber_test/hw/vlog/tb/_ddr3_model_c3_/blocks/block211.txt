This block is a system reset function for a memory system in Verilog. Upon the positive edge of a reset signal `rst_n_in`, the block is activated and performs a series of checks: it checks if the reset happens before 200 microseconds if `check_strict_timing` is enabled, and it gives a warning if this condition is not met; it checks if the clock enable signal `cke_in` is inactive when the reset goes inactive, and it throws an error if this is not true; it also checks if the `cke_in` is inactive for a minimum of 10 nanoseconds before the reset goes inactive and throws an error if this condition is not satisfied. Further, if MAX_MEM is not defined, the used memory is reset to 0.
