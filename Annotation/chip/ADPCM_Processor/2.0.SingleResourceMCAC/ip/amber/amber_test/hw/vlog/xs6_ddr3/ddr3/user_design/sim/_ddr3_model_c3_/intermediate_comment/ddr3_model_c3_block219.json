    "block_comment": "The task `set_latency` configures bus latency related parameters for read and write operations. Depending on the value of `al` (additive latency), it computes and sets the `additive_latency` variable accordingly. If `al` is 0, `additive_latency` is directly set to 0. Otherwise, it's determined by subtracting `al` from `cas_latency` (Column Address Strobe latency). Afterwards, it sets both `read_latency` and `write_latency` by adding `cas_latency` and `cas_write_latency` respectively to `additive_latency`."
