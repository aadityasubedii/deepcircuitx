    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for synchronous resetting and shifting of the 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb3' signal. Upon detection of a rising edge ('posedge') of either the master transmit clock ('MTxClk') or a reset signal ('Reset'), the block will carry out an operation. If a reset is detected, it will asynchronously set the 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb3' signal to '0'. In the absence of a reset, it will set 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb3' equal to the second synchronous buffer of the 'ReadTxDataFromFifo', denoted as 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb2'. The '#' operator indicates a delay of 'Tp' simulation time units before performing the assignment."
