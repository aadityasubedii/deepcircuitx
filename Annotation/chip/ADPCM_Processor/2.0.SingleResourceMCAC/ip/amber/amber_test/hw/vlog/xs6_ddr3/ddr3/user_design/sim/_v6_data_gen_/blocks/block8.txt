The block of Verilog code performs a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation between two sets of data, 'hdata' and 'w1data'. Iterating over a range up to four times the constant 'NUM_DQ_PINS', it applies the XOR operation on corresponding elements of 'hdata' and 'w1data', storing the result in the array 'ndata'.
