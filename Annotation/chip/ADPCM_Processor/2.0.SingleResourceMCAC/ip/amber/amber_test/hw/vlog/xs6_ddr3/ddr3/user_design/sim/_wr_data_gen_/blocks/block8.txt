This block of code in Verilog is used for controlling the ready command signal (cmd_rdyC) in response to different conditions. This operation is performed synchronously on the positive edge of clock (clk_i). When the reset signal (rst_i[0]) is high or the command start signal (cmd_startC) is activated and burst length (bl_i) equals 1, or the user burst count is 2 and the FIFO is not full (fifo_not_full), the ready command signal (cmd_rdyC) is set to 1 after a delay of TCQ (Time Clock to Q, a predefined technology-specific parameter). If none of these conditions is met and the block is executing on command start signal with burst length not equals 1, it sets the ready command signal to 0 after the same delay TCQ.
