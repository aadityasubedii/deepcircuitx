This block controls data flow within the memory controller for two conditions, when C_S4_AXI_ENABLE is either enabled or not. When not enabled, it directly maps the control and status signals of the user interface to memory controller. When enabled, it also performs address masking on both read and write address interfaces for AXI and synchronizes the calibration completion signal from ultra-scale+ memory controller to S4 AXI clock domain. Furthermore, it instantiates an axi_mcb module interfacing S4 AXI signals with the user interface and memory controller signals with parameterized configuration settings for address width, data width, AXI properties and enabling application ports. This manages the data transfers between AXI and memory controller interfaces.
