    "block_comment": "This block of code performs error checking on memory controller command (MCB) addresses. If the computed address (sum of 'mcb_cmd_addr_o' and 'mcb_cmd_bl_o' multiplied by the data width divided by 8) exceeds the provided endpoint address 'end_addr_i', an error message is displayed to notify the user, and the system sets 'error_access_range' to 1 and stops the operation to prevent data access beyond the address range."
