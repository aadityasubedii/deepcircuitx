    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for running the function dm_timing_check with an argument of 10, whenever there's a change in the tenth index value of the array dm_in. It adopts the 'always' keyword for continuous monitoring of the specified condition, i.e, alteration in dm_in[10], and subsequently calls the dm_timing_check function. This function call ensures appropriate checks are performed pertaining to delay or timing requirements."
