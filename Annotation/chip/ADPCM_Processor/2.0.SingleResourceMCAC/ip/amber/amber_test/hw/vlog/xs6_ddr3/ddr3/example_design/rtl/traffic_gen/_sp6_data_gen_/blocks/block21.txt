[187, 188]
Comment: 
The block serves a conditional checking function, specifically verifying if the data width (DWIDTH) is 128. If the DWIDTH equals 128, it then initiates the begin-end block named data_out128. This is accomplished using a generate if conditional statement which makes the hardware design more scalable and flexible in handling different data widths.
