    "block_comment": "The block configures the read and write data streams based on the specified port configuration and status of port enable. It checks the port configuration for B32 and R32 scenarios and if the port is enabled. If enabled, it sets the MIG and read/output signals tied to the port accordingly, otherwise these signals are set to zero. This ensures correct data transfer and status indication depending on port configuration and status."
