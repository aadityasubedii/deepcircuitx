    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls data write operations using a MIG (Memory Interface Generator) component in a specific configuration ('u_config1_5W'). If certain conditions are met, specified by 'C_PORT_CONFIG' and 'C_PORT_ENABLE' values, MIG's write functions are controlled by signals like 'p5_wr_clk' (clock), 'p5_wr_data' (write data), 'p5_wr_mask' (write mask), and 'p5_wr_en' (enable write). Signals are also used to monitor state information like whether the write operation is full, empty, has an error, or an underrun condition. If the conditions aren't met, these signals are all deactivated."
