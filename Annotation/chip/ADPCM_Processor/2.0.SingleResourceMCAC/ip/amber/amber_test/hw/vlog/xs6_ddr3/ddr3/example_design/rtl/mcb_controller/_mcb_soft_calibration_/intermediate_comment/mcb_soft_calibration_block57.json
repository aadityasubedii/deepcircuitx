    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a reset state for a memory controller block (MCB) interface in a digital hardware design. Upon a positive edge trigger of the user interface (UI) clock, the MCB along with IO DRP controller and other related variables are reset to their default states. This accounts for variables such as command validation, address, command enable, done calibration, backstore usage, DRP update, system reset, write mode, termination, active IO DRP, delay and counter management signals and state states control among others. This wide resetting operation ensures the system can be brought back to a known, stable condition after a reset condition is met. The MCB state machine is also sent back to the START state to initialize execution after reset."
