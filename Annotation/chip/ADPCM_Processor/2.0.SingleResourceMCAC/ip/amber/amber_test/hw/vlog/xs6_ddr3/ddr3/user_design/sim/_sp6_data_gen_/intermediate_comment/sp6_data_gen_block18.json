    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for setting specific hexadecimal values to SHIFTB registers based on the data mode (data_mode_i) input. When the 3-bit data_mode_i is 101, eight SHIFTB registers (from SHIFTB_0 to SHIFTB_7) are assigned distinct hex values, ranging from 'h0002_0001 to 'h8000_4000. Similarly, if the data_mode_i is 100, the same registers are assigned different hex values, this time ranging from 'h0000_0001 to 'h0000_0080. However, if the data_mode_i doesn't match any of the previously specified conditions, we have a catch-all \"else\" statement that assigns yet another group of hex values to the SHIFTB registers, ranging from 'hfffd_fffe to 'h7fff_bfff. It seems like a form of pseudorandom bit sequence value assignments based on data mode conditions."
