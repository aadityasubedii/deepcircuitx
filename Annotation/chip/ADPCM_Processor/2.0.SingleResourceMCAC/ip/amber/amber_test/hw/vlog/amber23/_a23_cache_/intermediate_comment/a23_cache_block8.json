    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block serves as an error detection mechanism in a cache system. When the summation of the data hits from way 0 and way 1 exceeds '1', this block prompts a testbench error message signifying that a 'Hit' has occurred in more than one cache way which is an irregular phenomenon. The block operates whenever there's a rising edge on the clock (i_clk) and checks the specific condition on each posedge."
