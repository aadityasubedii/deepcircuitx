Comment: 
This Verilog RTL code block handles IRQ/FIRQ interrupt status and control registers' read operations on a Wishbone interface for two interrupt vectors. Upon the positive edge of a clock signal and when a read request is initiated, according to the least significant 16 bits of the address signal, it selects the corresponding register and assigns its value to the read data 'wb_rdata32'. Two special cases handle the software interrupts for both vectors. If an unrecognized address is provided, it returns a default hexadecimal value '22334455'.
