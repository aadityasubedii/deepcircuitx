The module generates data read commands along with the necessary control signals in either a SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6 family of FPGA hardware. It supports various data patterns, burst lengths, data and address widths among other parameters. The module generates the appropriate command based on a command validation signal and adjusted by the current state of burst count and the module's family. The output is a ready command, signifying readiness for the next data item, and a data valid signal indicating the validity of the data presented. The module also contains different configurations for two different data generator modules for SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 respectively."
