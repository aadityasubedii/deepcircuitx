    "block_comment": "This block of code is handling data retrieval operations in a 4-way set associative cache. The operation involves the selection of data from one of the four 'ways' or slots. If there is a hit (indicated by `data_hit_way[n]` being true), the retrieved data `data_rdata_way[n]`  from the corresponding way is chosen and returned by `hit_rdata`. If a hit is not achieved in any of the ways, a default value `{CACHE_LINE_WIDTH{1'd1}}` is returned instead."
