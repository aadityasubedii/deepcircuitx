    "block_comment": "The block functions as a control logic for an under-run scenario in a transmission system, hooked onto a positive edge trigger. Upon each positive edge of `WB_CLK_I`, it handles transmission abort and empty buffer scenarios. If the system is reset or a transmission is aborted (`TxAbortPulse` is high), the under-run flip flop `TxUnderRun_wb` is reset (set to 0) after a certain delay denoted by `#Tp`. If the transmission buffer is empty and data is attempted to be read from FIFO (`ReadTxDataFromFifo_wb` is high), it reflects an under-run state, setting `TxUnderRun_wb` to 1 after the delay."
