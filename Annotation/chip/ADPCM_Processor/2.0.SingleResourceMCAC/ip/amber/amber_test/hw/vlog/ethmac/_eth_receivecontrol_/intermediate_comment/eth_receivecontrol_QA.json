It has functionalities mainly related to receiving, checking, buffering, and acknowledging Ethernet control frames. It appears to include detection of Pause frames (with or without address recognition) according to the 802.3x Ethernet standard. This module seems to handle checking of control frames' type/length and opcode, assembling and latching the timer values from decoded ethernet frames, maintaining the byte counters for identification of different fields in a frame, and handling of Pause mechanism operational logic based on the state of different signals and timers. Overall, the module plays a critical role in flow control in an Ethernet communication setting."
