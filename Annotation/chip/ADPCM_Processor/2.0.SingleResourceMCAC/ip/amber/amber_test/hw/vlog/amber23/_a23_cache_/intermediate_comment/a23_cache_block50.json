    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the cache hit signal in an exclusive cache design. If the `ex_read_hit_clear` signal is active, the code resets the `ex_read_hit_r` and `ex_read_hit_way` signals. In the event of a cache hit (`ex_read_hit`), the `ex_read_hit_r` is set, and `ex_read_hit_way` is set as the data from the cache, with an optional debug message. If no hit is present and the cache fill is complete, `ex_read_hit_way` gets updated with `select_way`."
