This block of code is responsible for triggering the dqs_neg_timing_check function every time there's a positive edge occurrence in the 16th index of the dqs_in array. The always @(posedge dqs_in[16]) statement in Verilog is used to observe changes in a specific bit of dqs_in and subsequently triggers the function whenever the bit changes from low to high. This function is typically used in timing checks within synchronous systems.
