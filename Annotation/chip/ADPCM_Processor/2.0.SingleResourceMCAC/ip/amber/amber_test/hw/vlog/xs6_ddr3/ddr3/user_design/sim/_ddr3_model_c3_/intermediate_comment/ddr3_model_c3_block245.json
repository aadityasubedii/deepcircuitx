    "block_comment": "This block of code is a simulation model for a delay buffer. The buffer serves the function of delay propagation of the 'cke' input signal to achieve synchronization in simulation environments. The delay is implemented using the '#BUS_DELAY' system task in the Verilog RTL code. An always block is used to consistently monitor changes at 'cke'. Whenever 'cke' changes, the block initiates and the system task '#BUS_DELAY' introduces the pre-specified delay before 'cke' is propagated to 'cke_in'.\n"
