    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for delay simulation. It sets the input dm_in to the value of variable dm_tdqs after a certain delay, represented by the parameter BUS_DELAY. The always @ construct in Verilog is used to describe the behavior that should occur in response to changes in the specified signals, in this case, dm_tdqs. The signal assignment using the <= operator ensures that changes to the dm_in signal occur only at the end of a simulation time step, ensuring accurate modeling of hardware behavior."
