    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mcb_traffic_gen' module acts as a traffic generator for a Memory Controller Block (MCB), generating memory operation commands and data patterns required for memory tests. It adapts to specific memory technologies using configurable parameters. Inputs include control signals, address ranges, and testing patterns, while outputs include data to be written to memory and status signals reflecting read/write operations and error states. Internally, the module makes effective use of FIFOs for command and data flow management, specific blocks handle command generation and data paths for read/write operations. This flexible design supports testing across various operation modes with fault error detection and status reporting capabilities."
