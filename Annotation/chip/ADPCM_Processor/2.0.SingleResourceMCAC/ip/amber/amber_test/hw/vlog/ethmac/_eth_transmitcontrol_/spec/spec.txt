Module name: eth_transmitcontrol. 

Module specification: 

The eth_transmitcontrol module is deployed for managing the data transmission process in an ethernet network protocol. It employs a range of input signals like MTxClk for synchronization of the data transmission, TxReset as the reset signal, TxUsedDataIn indicating the data in use, TxUsedDataOut signifying the status of output data, TxDoneIn as the end signal, and others. It outputs signals such as TxCtrlStartFrm and TxCtrlEndFrm, which denote the start and end of control frame transmission, CtrlMux as the control line of the multiplexer, ControlData carrying the control information with WillSendControlFrame indicating a control frame ready for transmission, and BlockTxDone blocking the TxDoneIn signal. 

The module contains internal signals like SendingCtrlFrm for controlling the sending of control frame, CtrlMux as the multiplexer control line, WillSendControlFrame indicating readiness of a control frame to be sent, DlyCrcCnt accounting for the CRC delay, ByteCnt as the byte counter, ControlEnd_q, MuxedCtrlData, TxCtrlStartFrm, TxCtrlStartFrm_q, TxCtrlEndFrm, ControlData, TxUsedDataIn_q, and BlockTxDone serving their respective purposes like control data multiplexing, start and end of control frame transmission, blockage of Done signal etc. 

The Verilog RTL code for this module is comprehensive of several code sections performing distinct functionalities. These include sections for setting the control frame ready for transmission, initiating or aborting the control frame transmission, controlling the transmission process, blocking the Done signal, setting a checksum delay count, resetting or incrementing a byte count, and deflecting control data. With a robust structure and multiple functions, the eth_transmitcontrol module is designed to efficiently regulate data transmission in an ethernet network protocol.
