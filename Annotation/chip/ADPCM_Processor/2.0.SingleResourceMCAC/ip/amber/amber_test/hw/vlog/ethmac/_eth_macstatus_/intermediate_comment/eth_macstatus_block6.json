    "block_comment": "This block ensures the packet size does not exceed a certain limit. If the system reset or LoadRxStatus signal is active, the `ReceivedPacketTooBig` flag is reset. If `TakeSample` is set, the flag is on only if the `RxByteCnt` is greater than `r_MaxFL`, provided packet processing is not huge (`~r_HugEn` is true)."
