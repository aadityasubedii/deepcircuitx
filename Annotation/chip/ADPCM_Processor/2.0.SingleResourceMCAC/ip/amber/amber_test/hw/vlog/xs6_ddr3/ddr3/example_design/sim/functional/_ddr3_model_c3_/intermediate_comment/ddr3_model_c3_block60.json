    "block_comment": "This block of code is for instantiating a timing check procedure for a DDR data strobe signal. On every positive edge of the 6th 'dqs_in' signal (indexed from 0), a procedure 'dqs_pos_timing_check' is called with an argument of '5'. This coded behavior contributes to the Advanced Data Strobe Timing Check, a pivotal protocol for DDR memory interface to ensure the data and strobe signals are synchronously transmitted."
