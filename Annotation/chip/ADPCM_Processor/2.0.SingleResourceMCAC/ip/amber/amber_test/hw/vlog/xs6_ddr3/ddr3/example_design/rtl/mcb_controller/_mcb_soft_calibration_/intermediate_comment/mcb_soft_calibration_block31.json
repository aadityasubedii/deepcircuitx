    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code describes two states in a state machine and handles the transitional logic among them. It firsts waits for the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal to be high in the state LDQS_PIN_N_TERM_WAIT, then proceeds to the next state (UDQS_CLK_WRITE_P_TERM). In the UDQS_CLK_WRITE_P_TERM state, the code configures the control register through several lines of code, sets IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR to PTerm, IODRPCTRLR_R_WB to WRITE_MODE, IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA to a bit combination including P_Term_w, sets MCB_UIADDR to IOI_UDQS_CLK and MCB_CMD_VALID to '1'. This action seems to serve as a setup for a write operation."
