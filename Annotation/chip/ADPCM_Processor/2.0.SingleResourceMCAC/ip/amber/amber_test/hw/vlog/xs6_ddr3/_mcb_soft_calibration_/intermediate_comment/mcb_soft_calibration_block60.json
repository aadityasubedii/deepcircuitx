    "block_comment": "The block triggers a flip-flop update at every positive edge of the UI_CLK clock pulse or when the MCB_UODATAVALID signal goes high. If MCB_UODATAVALID is '1', it sets the output register MCB_UODATAVALID_U to '1'. If MCB_UODATAVALID isn't '1', the output register MCB_UODATAVALID_U holds its prior state, creating a latch effect."
