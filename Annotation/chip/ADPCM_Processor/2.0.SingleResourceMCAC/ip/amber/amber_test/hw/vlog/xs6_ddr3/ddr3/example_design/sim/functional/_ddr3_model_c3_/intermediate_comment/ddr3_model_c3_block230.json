    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for initial setup and error-checking of defined parameters. The initial begin-end block in Verilog is typically used for code that only needs to be executed once. The first two checks present in this block display error messages if the conditions are not met: if BL_MAX parameter is less than 2, and if 2 to the power of BO_BITS is greater than BL_MAX. Both the conditions are used to ensure that certain thresholds are maintained for the parameters. The $timeformat statement is used to set the display format for time values, while 'seed' is initialized with the value of RANDOM_SEED. Lastly, the block sets the initial value of 'ck_cntr' as 0."
