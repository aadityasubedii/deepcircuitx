    "block_comment": "This block updates the end boundary address in a memory system. It does this at every positive edge of the input clock signal, meaning it updates synchronously with the main system clock. It works by subtracting the data width (divided by 8) from the defined end address, then adding 1 to ensure the calculated address falls within the desired memory boundary."
