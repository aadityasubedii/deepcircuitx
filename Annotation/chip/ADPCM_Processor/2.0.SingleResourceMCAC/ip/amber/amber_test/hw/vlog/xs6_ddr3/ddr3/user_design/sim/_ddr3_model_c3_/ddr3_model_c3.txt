Module-level comment: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, implementing timing and behavior of DDR3 memory operations. It handles command decoding, address processing, data read/write operations, and enforces various timing constraints. The module uses state machines, pipelines, and internal storage to model memory functionality. It performs extensive timing checks to ensure compliance with DDR3 specifications and includes features such as burst operations, power-down modes, self-refresh, and on-die termination.
