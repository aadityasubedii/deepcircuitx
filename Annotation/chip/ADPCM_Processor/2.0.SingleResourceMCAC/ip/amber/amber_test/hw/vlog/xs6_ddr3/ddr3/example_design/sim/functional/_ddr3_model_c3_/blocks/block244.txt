Comment: 
This block of code manages a delay on the clock enable ('cke') signal. The implemented behavior insures that the 'cke' signal is delayed by a certain amount of time defined as 'BUS_DELAY' before it is asserted to 'cke_in', providing control over when the subsequent modules or operations triggered by this signal should be invoked.
