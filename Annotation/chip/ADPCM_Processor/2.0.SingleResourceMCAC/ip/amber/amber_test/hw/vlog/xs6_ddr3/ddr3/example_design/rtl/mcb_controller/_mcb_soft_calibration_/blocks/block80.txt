Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for defining the reset condition for the training cycle of the Clock Enable (CKE) signal in a memory controller or any other digital system that uses a CKE signal. The implementation uses an `always` block, which is a concurrent procedural block in Verilog that gets activated whenever the reset variable (`RST`) changes. When this occurs, the CKE_Train signal is set low (`1'b0`), hence stopping any ongoing training or initialization processes.
