    "block_comment": "The given block of code performs bit-wise shift or rotation operations on a 32-bit operand. Depending on the value of `i_function`, it selects one of four operations: logical shift left (LSL), logical shift right (LSR), arithmetic shift right (ASR), or rotation right (ROR). The computed result is stored in `o_out[31]`, and any overflow or out of range bits from the operation are stored in `o_carry_out`. The specific bitwise operation is selected using a conditional ternary operator `? : `, creating a cascading selection structure based on the value of `i_function`."
