    "block_comment": "This block implements a logic OR operation for the purpose of resetting a counter. The reset signal (`dcount_rst`) will be set (\"high\" or logical 1) if either the `counts_rst` is set or if the first element (`rst_ra[0]`) of the reset register array (`rst_ra`) is set. The `assign` statement in Verilog is used for continuous assignment which means the value of `dcount_rst` will be constantly updated as the values of `counts_rst` or `rst_ra[0]` change."
