    "block_comment": "This block of code checks if the DRP controller is busy and stores the read data if it isn't. First, it waits for the IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N signal to indicate that it's not busy. If the controller is busy, the block keeps the current state. If the controller is not busy, it reads data into Max_Value from IODRPCTRLR_READ_DATA. Then, if First_In_Term_Done flag has not been set, the block changes the state to RST_DELAY and sets the First_In_Term_Done flag. If the flag has already been set, it changes state to ANALYZE_MAX_VALUE."
