Comment: 
This block of code is a clock-triggered event that generates a mode load pulse. More specifically, the pulse is asserted at the positive edge of the given clock signal 'clk_i'. The line of code uses a delay modeled by #TCQ, and the pulse is generated when 'mode_load_d1' is true and 'mode_load_d2' is not true. The output signal 'mode_load_pulse' is set according to these conditions. The block thus provides a temporal mechanism to respond to specific states of 'mode_load_d1' and 'mode_load_d2' signals under the timing of the clock signal.
