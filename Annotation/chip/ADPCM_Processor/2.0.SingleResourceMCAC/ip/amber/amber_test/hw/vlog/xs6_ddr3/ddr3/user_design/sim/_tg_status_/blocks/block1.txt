This block of Verilog code implements an error detection system with manual reset. When the `rst_i` or `manual_clear_error` signals are high, the `error_status` and `error_set` states reset. In the absence of these signals, the system checks for data error (`data_error_i`). If a data error is detected, the current hardware status is stored in `error_status` (addresses, buffer status, comparison and read data) and `error_set` is set to true, indicating an error has occurred. The `error_status` is then zeroed out for unused bits to maintain data integrity and size.
