    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a sequential logic block that controls the Most Significant Bits (MSB) of the Receive Pointer (RxPointerMSB). The logic block is triggered on the rising edge of the WriteBack Clock (WB_CLK_I) or when a system reset event occurs. When the system is reset, the RxPointerMSB is cleared to all zeros. If the Receive Enable (RxEn) signal and its delayed version (RxEn_q) are both high, and the Pointer is being read (RxPointerRead), the MSB of the Pointer is updated with bits 31:2 from the output of a RAM module (ram_do). Moreover, if the Master signaling WriteBack RX event and the acknowledgment signal (m_wb_ack_i) is received, the RxPointerMSB is incremented by 1."
