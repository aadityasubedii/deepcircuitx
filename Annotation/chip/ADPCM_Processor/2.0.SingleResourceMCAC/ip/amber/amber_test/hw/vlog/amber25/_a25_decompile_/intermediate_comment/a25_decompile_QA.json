Its primary function is to translate machine code instructions into human-readable assembly language during simulation or debugging. The module takes various inputs related to the processor's state and current instruction, and generates detailed textual output describing each executed instruction, including its mnemonic, operands, and memory accesses. It also handles interrupt events and provides information about program flow. This decompiler is likely used for debugging and analysis purposes during the development and testing of the ARM processor implementation."
