This block of code is responsible for assigning the 'master_ack' signal, based on the 'current_slave' value. The implementation uses a conditional (ternary) operator to accomplish this. The 'master_ack' is assigned a corresponding 'i_sX_wb_ack' signal based on the 'current_slave' 4-bit value. If 'current_slave' matches a value between 4'd0 and 4'd7, the 'master_ack' gets the corresponding 'i_sX_wb_ack' value. In case the 'current_slave' value falls outside this range, the 'master_ack' is assigned the 'i_s2_wb_ack' value by default.
