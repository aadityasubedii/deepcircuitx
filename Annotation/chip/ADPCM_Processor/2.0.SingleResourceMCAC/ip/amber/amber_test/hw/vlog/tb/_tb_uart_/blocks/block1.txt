Comment: 
This Verilog code block corresponds to the implementation of a UART transmitter state machine, which is responsible for asynchronously sending data bits over serial communication. Upon a reset condition, the block initializes the state variables to zero and sets transmission data, `o_uart_txd`, high representing the IDLE state of the UART protocol. If no reset is present and the transmission begins (`tx_bit_start`), the block executes a state machine with three states (idle, data bit send, and completion state). In the idle state, if start condition (`tx_start`) is triggered and transmit FIFO (First-In, First-Out memory) is not empty, the block fetches a byte from it, incrementing read pointer and starts the transmission by pulling `o_uart_txd` low. In the data bit send state, the block shifts out the data bits and sets `o_uart_txd` accordingly. Upon transmitting a byte, the state machine returns to the idle state, signifying completion of a data byte transfer.
