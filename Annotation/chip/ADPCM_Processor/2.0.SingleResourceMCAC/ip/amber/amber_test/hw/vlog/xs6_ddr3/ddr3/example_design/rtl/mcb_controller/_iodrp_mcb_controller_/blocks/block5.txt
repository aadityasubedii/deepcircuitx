Comment: 
This Verilog block manages the DRP (Dynamic Reconfiguration Port) and MCB (Memory Controller Block) operation states. Upon the rising edge of the DRP_CLK clock signal, the DRP_ADD, and DRP_CS lines are set high if the next state is the ADDR_PHASE, with DRP_CS also set high in the DATA_PHASE. The MCB_UIREAD becomes active during a read operation in the DATA_PHASE. If currently in the READY state, the DRP_BKST line is configured as per the broadcast setting.
