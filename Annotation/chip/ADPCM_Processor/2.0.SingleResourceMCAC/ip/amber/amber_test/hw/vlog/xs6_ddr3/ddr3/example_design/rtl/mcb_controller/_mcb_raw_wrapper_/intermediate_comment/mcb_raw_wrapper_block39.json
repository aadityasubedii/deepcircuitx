    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for configuring various settings in the Memory Controller Block (MCB) when certain conditions are met during non-calibration mode. The application of several \"assign\" statements within the code block dictates how different variables and signals of the MCB will behave. These statements include setting the DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL to logic low, triggering MCB system reset, and instructing the MCB on how to handle various inputs and UI events such as recalibration, addition, clock, and read operations. When the system isn't in simulation mode, it begins with an initialization sequence. This facilitates smooth and correct execution of the MCB operations under these specific conditions.\n"
