It has both read and write capabilities. The RAM is broken down into 32 instances of 16x1 RAM sub-modules (\"RAM16X1D\"). Each subroutine represents a single bit of the 32-bit words stored in the memory. The module accepts 32-bit data for writing into the RAM, a write enable signal, a clock signal, as well as 4-bit read and write addresses. The output of the module is a 32-bit data from the memory. It performs these operations based on the control signals provided (write enable and clock)."

If this signal is high, it means that the RAM is in write mode and it will store the 32 bit data received from data_in port at the address provided by write_address port.\n\n2. wclk: This is a single bit input signal, specifically a clock signal. Explanation: This signal is responsible for synchronizing the read, write operations in RAM.\n\n3. data_in: This port is a 32 bit input signal. Explanation: This port is used to provide data which needs to be written in RAM.\n\n4. write_address and read_address: These are 4-bit addressing input ports. Explanation: write_address port provides the address where the input data has to be written when the write enable signal is high. read_address port provides the address that needs to be accessed when data is being read.\n\nOutput ports:\n\n1. data_out: This port is a 32 bit output signal.
