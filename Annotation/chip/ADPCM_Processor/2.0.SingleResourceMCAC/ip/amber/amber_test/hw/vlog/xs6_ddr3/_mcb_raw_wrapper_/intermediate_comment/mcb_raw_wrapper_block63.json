    "block_comment": "This block initializes and sets all control and command signals of the memory interface generator (MIG) ports 3 and 5 to zero. It does so by using Verilog's `assign` statement, which assigns a constant value of zero to all MIG control and command signals. This includes clock signal, enable signal, row address, bank address, column address, instruction, burst length and the arbitration enable for both the MIG ports 3 and 5."
