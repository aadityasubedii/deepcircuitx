    "block_comment": "This block of code is handling conditional control signals for a count based on the readiness of some data and another user-defined controllable count. This block is triggered on the rising edge of the input clock `clk_i`. If the `user_burst_cnt` equals to 2, and `data_rdy_i` is ready or set to 1, the `next_count_is_one` is set to 1 with a delay of `#TCQ`. In all other scenarios, `next_count_is_one` is set to 0 with a delay of `#TCQ`."
