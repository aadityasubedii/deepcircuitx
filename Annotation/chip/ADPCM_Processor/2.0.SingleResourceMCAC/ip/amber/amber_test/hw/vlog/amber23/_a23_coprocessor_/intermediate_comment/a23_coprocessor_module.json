    "module": "Module-level comment: The module a23_coprocessor functions as a cache controller and fault handler within the system. It operates based on a set of inputs, notably instructions, operations, and addresses, regulated by a clock pulse. The logic includes separate control paths for writing data, managing cacheable, updatable, and disruptive areas, as well as fault handling. Outputs include data read by the coprocessor, cache enable signal, cache flush state, and cacheable area. This core functionality is achieved via the efficient use of internal signals and conditional logic blocks. Debugging statements provide operational visibility when required."
