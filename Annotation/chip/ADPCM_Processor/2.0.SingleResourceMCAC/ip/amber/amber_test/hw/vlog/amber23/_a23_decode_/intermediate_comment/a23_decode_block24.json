    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code mainly performs the operation of shift amount assignment and checks if the immediate shift amount is zero. The immediate shift amount for the next cycle is assigned as the currently given shift amount 'shift_imm'. Further, it checks if the next immediate shift amount is zero and also if the 'barrel_shift_amount_sel_nxt' equals '2'd2. If both conditions aremet, 'shift_imm_zero_nxt' is set to TRUE."
