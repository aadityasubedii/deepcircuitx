    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a task named 'wcond' that writes condition codes to a file based on a hexadecimal input. The task takes no input parameters, instead using a presumed global or higher scoped variable named 'condition'. It uses a case statement to process the 'condition' variable, mapping each possible 4-bit hexadecimal value (4'hX) to a corresponding condition code string, which it writes to 'decompile_file'. If 'condition' does not match any of the defined cases, it defaults to writing \"nv\"."
