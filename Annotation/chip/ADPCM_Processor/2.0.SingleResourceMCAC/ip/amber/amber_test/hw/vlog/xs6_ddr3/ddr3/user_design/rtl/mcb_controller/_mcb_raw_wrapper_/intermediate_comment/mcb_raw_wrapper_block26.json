    "block_comment": "This block of code configures an OSERDES2 Serializer for DDR2 and DDR3 memory types. Depending on the memory type specified by C_MEM_TYPE, the OSERDES2 is instantiated to configure memory On Die Termination (ODT) with the corresponding clock, reset, data, and control signals. The configured ODT includes input signals for clock (ioclk0), data (odt_90), clock enable (pll_ce_0), system reset (int_sys_rst), and other pipeline stages with constant values, along with a designated output (ioi_odt). All parameters are specifically set considering the DDR2 and DDR3 memory types in mind."
