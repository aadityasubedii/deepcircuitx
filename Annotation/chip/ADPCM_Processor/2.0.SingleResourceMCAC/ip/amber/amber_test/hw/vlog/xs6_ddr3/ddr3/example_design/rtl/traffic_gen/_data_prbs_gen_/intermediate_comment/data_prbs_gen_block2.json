    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to continuously monitor and update the value of the variable 'prbs', based on the bit range `[PRBS_WIDTH:1]` from the Q-output of a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) 'lfsr_q'. This is achieved by using an 'always' block which triggers at every change of the specified bits in 'lfsr_q', assigning the value to 'prbs' inside the always block."
