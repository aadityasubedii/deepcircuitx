Comment: 
This block is a declaration of an OSERDES2 module, specifically as 'ioi_we_0', which serves as a serializer for parallel data to serial output. The design has been configured with a data width of 2, suggesting it is converting 2-bit parallel data into a serial stream. The 'we_90' signal serves as input data to be serialized. The clock 'ioclk0' controls the rate of serialization. The system reset signal 'int_sys_rst' is wired to reset the whole circuitry, and 'pll_ce_0' signal controls the operation of serializer. The other data, clock, and control signals are either unused (wired to '1'b0') or permanently enabled, inferred by a hardcoded '1'b1'.
