    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code represents a synchronous digital circuit responsible for handling transmission abort requests. The digital circuit is driven by 'WB_CLK_I' clock signal or a positive edge 'Reset'. On reset, the 'TxAbortPacket' is set to '0', indicating no abort request. However, when certain conditions are satisfied such as 'TxAbort_wb', 'MasterWbTX and 'MasterAccessFinished' being high, while 'tx_burst_en' and 'TxAbortPacketBlocked' being low or 'TxAbort_wb' being high while 'MasterWbTX' and 'TxAbortPacketBlocked' are low, it sets the 'TxAbortPacket' to '1', signaling an abort request. In all other cases, it resets the 'TxAbortPacket' to '0'."
