    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM device, implementing memory operations, timing checks, and protocol compliance. It models the behavior of memory arrays, handles read/write operations, and enforces DDR3 specifications. The module uses state machines for command decoding, pipelines for operation scheduling, and timing counters to ensure proper signal timing and latency. It also includes error checking for timing violations and illegal operations, supporting various DDR3 features like multiple banks, burst modes, and on-die termination."
