    "block_comment": "The given block of code in Verilog RTL defines two states within a finite state machine (FSM) namely 'OFF_ZIO_NTERM' and 'WAIT8'. During the 'OFF_ZIO_NTERM' state, an I/O command to write '8'b00' to a memory cell is prepared. This command is indicated as valid (IODRPCTRLR_CMD_VALID = 1'b1) and it is marked as a write operation (IODRPCTRLR_R_WB = WRITE_MODE). Once the controller is ready (IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N = True), it then moves to the 'WAIT8' state. In the 'WAIT8' state, it waits until the command processing is done (IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N = False) and then proceeds based on whether the 'First_In_Term_Done' condition is met or not. If met, it moves to 'START_DYN_CAL' state otherwise it moves to 'WRITE_CALIBRATE' state.\n"
