    "block_comment": "This code block assigns the input wire `bl_i` to the output wire `rd_bl_o`. It is a one-line statement in Verilog that directly ties the input value to the output. The `assign` keyword is used to establish this relationship, accomplishing a continuous assignment. This operation is used when the value of the output wire is expected to immediately reflect any changes to the input signal."
