    "block_comment": "This block primarily controls the state machine sequence of a memory controller subsystem. The subsystem waits for a start broadcast signal and then based on different conditional statements, the block alters the MCB_PORT's active IODRP (Instruction, Operand data Register pairs) and the state of the system. If the start broadcast is received and IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N is asserted, the block checks whether P_Term or N_Term has changed since the last cycle or if SKIP_IN_TERM_CAL is asserted. It then correspondingly updates P_Term_Prev/N_Term_Prev and shifts the state to BROADCAST_PTERM/BROADCAST_NTERM. If no change is detected, it transitions to state OFF_RZQ_PTERM. If the start broadcast signal is not detected, it stays in the current state."
