    "block_comment": "The block forms two output assignment statements using a combination of flag status bits, IRQ mask, FIRQ mask, processor status, and execution mode. It employs the 'assign' keyword to allocate values for r15_out_rm and r15_out_rm_nxt; the former takes the current processor status (r15) while the latter takes the program counter (i_pc). Both outputs are constructed as bit concatenation of different system signal states and processor status, which are useful to display stack pointer for current and next instructions respectively."
