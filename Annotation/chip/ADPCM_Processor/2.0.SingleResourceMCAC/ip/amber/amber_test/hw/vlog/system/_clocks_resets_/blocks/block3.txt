Comment: 
The provided Verilog block generates a clock signal based on a positive edge of an incoming broad clock (`i_brd_clk_p`). This is accomplished by ensuring the PLL clock behavioral (`pll_clk_beh`) alternates between high and low values at every delay of half a clock period (`pll_clk_period` / 2). The process repeats for every positive clock edge of `i_brd_clk_p`, thus creating a stable clock generation routine based off the broad clock input.
