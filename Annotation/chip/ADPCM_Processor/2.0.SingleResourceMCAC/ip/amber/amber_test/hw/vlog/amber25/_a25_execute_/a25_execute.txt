Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements the execute stage of a processor pipeline. It performs arithmetic and logical operations using an ALU, barrel shifter, and multiplier. It manages register access, memory operations, and status updates. The module processes instructions based on processor mode and condition codes, handles interrupts, and controls privilege levels. It operates synchronously with clock and reset inputs, and includes testing provisions.
