This block of Verilog RTL code handles memory control buffer (MCB) command address updating. It's designed to be clock-driven, and updates the command address on the rising edge of the input clock (clk_i). The address update only occurs if the command enable input (mcb_cmd_en_i) is activated, triggering asynchronous command address loading with the input address, (mcb_cmd_addr_i) and storing it in the registered address (mcb_cmd_addr_r).
