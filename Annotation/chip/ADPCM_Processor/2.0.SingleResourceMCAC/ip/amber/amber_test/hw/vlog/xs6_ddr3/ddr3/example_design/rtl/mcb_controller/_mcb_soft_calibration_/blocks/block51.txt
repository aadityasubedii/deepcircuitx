Comment: 
The block provides a finite state machine (FSM) which checks the readiness of the IODRPCTRLR, and if not ready, it remains in the current state (WAIT2). If ready, it then checks two other conditions, `RZQ_IN` or `P_Term` is maximum, before transitioning to the next state (MULTIPLY_DIVIDE), or else it moves to the `INC_PTERM` state. The implementation is done through if-else statements for state transitions, based on the results of various condition checks.
