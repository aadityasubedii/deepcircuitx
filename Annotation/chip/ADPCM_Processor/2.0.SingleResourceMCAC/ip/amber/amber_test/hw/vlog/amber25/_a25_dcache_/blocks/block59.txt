This block handles the address for a write-back cache. The cache address is reset to zero when a reset signal is high. If a cache request is made, the address from the request is stored in the write-back address. Alternatively, if the cache is ready and in fill state, the address is advanced to the next 16-byte aligned address. This enables efficient caching by moving to the next block once the current one is filled.
