Comment: 
This block assigns an interrupt mode based on the value of the `next_interrupt` signal. The conditional operator `? :` is heavily used for parallel selection among different interrupt modes such as FIRQ, IRQ, SVC, and USR. Depending on the 3-bit value of `next_interrupt`, from 2 (FIRQ) to 7 (SVC), the `interrupt_mode` is determined, defaulting to USR when `next_interrupt` is not within the specified range.
