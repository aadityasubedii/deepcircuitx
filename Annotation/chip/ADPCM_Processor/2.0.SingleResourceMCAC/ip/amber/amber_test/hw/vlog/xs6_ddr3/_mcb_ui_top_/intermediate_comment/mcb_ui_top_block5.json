    "block_comment": "The block of code describes a conditional construct based on the state of `C_S5_AXI_ENABLE`. If this flag is not set, it copies local module signals to interface signals within the `P5_UI_MCB` block. If `C_S5_AXI_ENABLE` is enabled, it enters into `P5_UI_AXI` block. First, it assigns the address after masking for read and write transactions. A single-bit synchronization process is initiated for the calibration completion signal. In addition, this block instantiates two modules, namely `mcb_ui_top_synch` and `axi_mcb` with necessary width parameters, address widths, and control flags, as well as assigns the relevant axi and mcb interfaces. This enables the S_AXI interface to be mapped to the memory controller to perform read/write transactions."
