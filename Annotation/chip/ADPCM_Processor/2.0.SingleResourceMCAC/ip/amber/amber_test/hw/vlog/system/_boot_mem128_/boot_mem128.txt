Module-level comment: This module, boot_mem128, functions as a memory segment for a Wishbone-bus architecture system, supporting read-write operations. It uses start_write and start_read internal signals to initialize these operations, holding data with read_data and write_data signals. Byte-specific enablement at the memory location is achieved with the byte_enable signal. The module dynamically adjusts for debug modes and different FPGA utilization through conditional compilation directives. It also includes files based on specific directives to support various boot files.
