    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM device, modeling its timing, functionality, and behavior. It implements command decoding, data handling, and timing checks for various DDR3 operations including read, write, activate, precharge, and refresh. The module uses internal signals to track timing, state, and configuration, and manages mode registers, bank status, and pipeline stages. It performs thorough timing checks and violations reporting, simulating the complex timing requirements of DDR3 memory operations."
