    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronous system that resets or updates two signals, `PacketFinished` and `PacketFinished_q`, based on the condition of the `Reset` input. When a rising edge is detected on the `MTxClk` clock signal or the `Reset` signal, the module is activated via the `always @ (posedge MTxClk or posedge Reset)` line. If the `Reset` signal is high, the two signals `PacketFinished` and `PacketFinished_q` are asynchronously reset to '0'. Otherwise, in the absence of Reset, the `PacketFinished` signal takes its next value from `PacketFinished_d`, while the `PacketFinished_q` signal gets its next value from the `PacketFinished` signal. The `#Tp` delay value handles any propagation delay associated with these assignments."
