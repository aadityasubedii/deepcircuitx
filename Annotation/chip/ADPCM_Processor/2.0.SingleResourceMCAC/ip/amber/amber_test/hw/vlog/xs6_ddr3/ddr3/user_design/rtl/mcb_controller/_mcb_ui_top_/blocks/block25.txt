This block of code switches between two modes based on the value of `C_MCB_USE_EXTERNAL_BUFPLL`. For `C_MCB_USE_EXTERNAL_BUFPLL == 0`, it instantiates a BUFPLL_MCB module, which is a specialized phase-locked loop device designed for memory controller blocks (MCB) in Spartan-6 FPGAs. The input clocks are generated by dividing the input frequency by 2 and the lock source is provided as `"LOCK_TO_0"`. For `C_MCB_USE_EXTERNAL_BUFPLL != 0`, it configures the `pll_ce_0_i`, `pll_ce_90_i`, `ioclk0`, `ioclk180` directly from the inputs `pll_ce_0`, `pll_ce_90`, `sysclk_2x`, `sysclk_2x_180` respectively and the `pll_lock` is directly assigned to `pll_lock_bufpll_o`.
