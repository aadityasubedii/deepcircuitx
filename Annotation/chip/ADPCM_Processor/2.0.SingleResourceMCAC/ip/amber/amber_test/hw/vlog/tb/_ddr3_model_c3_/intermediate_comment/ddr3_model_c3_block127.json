    "block_comment": "This block of code invokes the function `dq_timing_check` with the argument `3` whenever there is a change in the `dq_in[3]` signal. It sets up a sensitivity list for `dq_in[3]`, meaning that the block will only be activated when the state of `dq_in[3]` changes. This is achieved by using an `always` block, which is a key construct in Verilog used for both combinational and sequential logic but here used for combinational logic given it executes with the change in the input signal."
