Comment: 
This block manages the synchronous reading of data from a FIFO buffer. It executes on either the rising edge of the input clock signal (WB_CLK_I) or the positive edge of the reset signal. If the reset signal is high, the block will reset the synchronous FIFO read process (ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync1) to '0'. If the reset signal is not high, the system will assign the value of 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_tck' to 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync1' on the next positive edge of the input clock signal. This mechanism ensures synchronous data reading from the FIFO.
