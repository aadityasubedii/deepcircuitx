    "module": "Module-level comment: This 'test_module' acts as a system handler managing Wishbone communication protocol, interrupts, random number generation, and UART communication, along with LED and PHY interfaces. It uses distinct input-output ports along with internally declared signals for efficient management. The code uses 'generate' and 'always' blocks to handle operations based on the Wishbone data width and specific conditions during the clock signal's positive edge. Actions like read/write operations, interrupts, timers, and system control are implemented through nested conditional statements. This module provides a comprehensive and systematic approach to control system execution."
