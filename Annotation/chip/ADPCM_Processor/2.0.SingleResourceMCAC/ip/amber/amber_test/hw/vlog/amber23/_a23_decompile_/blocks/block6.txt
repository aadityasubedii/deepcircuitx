Comment: 
This block is a function called get_reg_val that takes an input register number and returns the value of the respective register. It achieves this using a case statement to map the input with a corresponding register in the U_REGISTER_BANK. It maps 5-bit input numbers (ranging from 0 to 21) to individual registers within the U_REGISTER_BANK module, returning the output from the appropriate register based on the input. Processing is conditionally branched according to the input to extract the required value from relevant register.
