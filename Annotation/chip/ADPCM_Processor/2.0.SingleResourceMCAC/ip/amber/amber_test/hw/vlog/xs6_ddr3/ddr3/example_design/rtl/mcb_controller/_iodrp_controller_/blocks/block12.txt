The given Verilog block is a string representation generator for various phases in a finite state machine. In this block, an 'always' block is used which executes at every change of 'state'. An ASCII string equivalent of each phase is selected using a 'case' statement that matches 'state' with predefined finite state machine phases such as 'READY', 'DECIDE', 'ADDR_PHASE' etc. The string equivalent of a matching state is then assigned to 'state_ascii'.
