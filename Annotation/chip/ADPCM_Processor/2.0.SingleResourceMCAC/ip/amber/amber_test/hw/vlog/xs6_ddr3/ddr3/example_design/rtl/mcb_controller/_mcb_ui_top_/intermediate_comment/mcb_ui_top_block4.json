    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for signal assignment in a digital system design. It assigns internal system signals with the corresponding external interface signals for the purpose of reading data. The `assign` keyword is used for continuous assignment statements that declare net data types, facilitating communication between the internal system signals and the external interface. The model receives read clock (`p5_rd_clk_i`), read enable (`p5_rd_en_i`), full status (`p5_rd_full_i`), empty status (`p5_rd_empty_i`), count of data (`p5_rd_count_i`), overflow indicator (`p5_rd_overflow_i`) and error indicators (`p5_rd_error_i`) as inputs; and assigns them to the respective external interface read signals. The block also forwards internal read data (`p5_rd_data_i`) to the external interface (`p5_rd_data`)."
