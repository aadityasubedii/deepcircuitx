    "block_comment": "This code block assigns the value of the RxError signal based on the status of RxStatusInLatched signal. Specifically, it generates an RxError when any bit within either the [6:3] range or the [1:0] range of RxStatusInLatched is high (logical '1'), indicating a received error. This is done using the logical OR operator '|' which returns a high output if any bit of the input binary number is high."
