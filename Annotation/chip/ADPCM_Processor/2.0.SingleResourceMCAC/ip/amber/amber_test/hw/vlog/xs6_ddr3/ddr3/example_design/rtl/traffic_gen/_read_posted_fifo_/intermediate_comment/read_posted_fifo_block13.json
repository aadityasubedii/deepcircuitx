    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is a synchronous always block that controls the 'wait_done' signal based on a few conditions. The block gets executed at the rising edge of 'clk_i'. The 'wait_done' signal is set to high immediately upon reset (rst_i) condition. If reset is not active and there's a ready command (cmd_rdy_o) aligned with command validation (cmd_valid_i), 'wait_done' is set to low. Given the absence of these signals, 'wait_done' is dictated by 'wait_cnt'. If 'wait_cnt' equals zero, then 'wait_done' goes high, otherwise, it remains low. These operations might be related to some command processing unit where 'wait_done' indicates the completion of command execution or wait period."
