The block is a function named Data_Gen that generates a data pattern based on the input integer 'i'. Function takes an integer 'i' as an input and outputs a 4*NUM_DQ_PINS bit pattern. The implementation divides 'i' by 2 to calculate 'j'. Depending on whether 'i' is odd or even, it generates different data patterns. Based on 'j', it sequentially selects the parts of the output pattern to which it assigns different 8-bit values. Those values are assigned to the segments of Data_Gen in the positions derived from the product of 'j' and constant NUM_DQ_PINS. For odd 'i' values patterns are more shifted to the left, while for even 'i' values they're more shifted to the right.
