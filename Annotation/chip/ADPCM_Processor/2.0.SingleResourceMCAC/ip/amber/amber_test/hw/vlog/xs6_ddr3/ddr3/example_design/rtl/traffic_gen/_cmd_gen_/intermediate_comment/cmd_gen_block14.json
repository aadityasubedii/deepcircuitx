    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the value of the `force_rd` signal. The functionality of this signal is driven by a digital clock (`clk_i`) and it resets `force_rd` to 0 when the 5th bit of `rst_i` is active or sets `force_rd` to 1 when the 4th element of `force_rd_counts` is active; otherwise, it keeps `force_rd`  at 0. The propagation delay `#TCQ` affects the time it takes for input changes to affect the outputs, providing control of the signal timing."
