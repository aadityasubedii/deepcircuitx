This block serves the purpose of generating a set of serial deserializers (OSERDES2) using Verilog's generate construct. These deserializers operate on an address of width defined by the constant `C_MEM_ADDR_WIDTH`. The instantiated OSERDES2 modules have their properties configured with predefined constants such as `C_OSERDES2_DATA_RATE_OQ`, `C_OSERDES2_DATA_RATE_OT`, `C_OSERDES2_OUTPUT_MODE_SE`, and `C_OSERDES2_SERDES_MODE_MASTER`. The interfaces for the clock, reset, and data are tied to specific signals (`ioclk0`, `int_sys_rst`, `address_90[addr_ioi]`). For each generated OSERDES2 instance, the output `OQ` is connected to `ioi_addr[addr_ioi]`, while the tristate control output `TQ` is connected to `t_addr[addr_ioi]`. The remaining control inputs and outputs are either tied to a neutral value such as `1'b0` or `1'b1`, or connected to some control signals (`pll_ce_0`).
