    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as an acknowledgment logic control for the Wishbone interface. When a strobe signal (i_wb_stb) is active and either writing or reading operation is initiated (signaled by wb_start_write or wb_start_read_d1), the acknowledgment signal (o_wb_ack) is activated indicating a successful operation."
