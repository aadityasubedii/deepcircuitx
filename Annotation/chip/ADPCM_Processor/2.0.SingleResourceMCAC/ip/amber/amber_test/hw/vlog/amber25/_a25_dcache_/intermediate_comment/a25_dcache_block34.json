    "block_comment": "This block of code acts as a conditional assignment for a read hit in an exclusive access scenario of a cache memory system in Verilog. It checks whether the system is in an exclusive accessing mode (`exclusive_access`), is not in a write-enable mode (`!i_write_enable`), and whether the cache access results in a hit during idle state (`idle_hit`). Upon satisfying all these conditions, a read hit (`ex_read_hit`) is acknowledged."
