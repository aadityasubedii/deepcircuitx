    "block_comment": "This block initiates a DQS (Data Strobe) timing check function during the rising edge of the DQS signal. It leverages an always block triggered by a positive edge of the 7th bit in the dqs_in signal (which is an input signal array) to run the dqs_pos_timing_check function for the 7th bit. This construct ensures that the timing check function is invoked in synchrony with the specific DQS signal transition, maintaining timing integrity."
