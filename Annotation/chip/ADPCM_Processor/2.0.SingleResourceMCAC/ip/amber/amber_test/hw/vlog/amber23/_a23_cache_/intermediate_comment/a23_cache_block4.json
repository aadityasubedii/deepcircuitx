    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a cache hit detector that logs an error message if more than one cache ways get hit at the same time. The implementation utilizes an edge-triggered always block sensitive to positive clock edges. In each clock cycle, it checks if the sum of the boolean values in 'data_hit_way' array has exceeded one, indicating hits on multiple cache ways. If this condition is met, a pre-defined macro `TB_ERROR_MESSAGE` is invoked, and an error message is displayed."
