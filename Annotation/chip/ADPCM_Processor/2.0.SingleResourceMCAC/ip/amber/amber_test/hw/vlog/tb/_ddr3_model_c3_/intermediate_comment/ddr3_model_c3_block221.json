    "block_comment": "This block of code is dedicated to the memory write task. It accepts address parameters (bank, row, col) and data to be written (input data). Depending on whether MAX_MEM is defined, it either write the data to a file (based on the memory location calculated by row, col) or organizes memory locations in an `address` array and writes the associated data to the corresponding location in the `memory` array. If memory overflows (`memory_used == MEM_SIZE`), an error message is displayed, and program execution can be stopped based on configuration."
