Module name: a25_decompile. Module specification: The a25_decompile module is a Verilog implementation of a decompiler for an ARM processor, likely an ARM25 variant. Its primary function is to translate machine code instructions into human-readable assembly language during simulation or debugging. The module takes various inputs related to the processor's state and current instruction, including clock, reset, instruction data, validity flags, interrupt signals, and program counter information. It doesn't have explicit output ports; instead, it generates detailed textual output describing each executed instruction, including its mnemonic, operands, and memory accesses, which is written to a file for analysis. Internally, the module uses numerous signals to extract and process instruction components, such as opcodes, register numbers, and immediate values. The code is organized into several blocks, including instruction decoding, execution tracking, interrupt handling, and output formatting. Key functionalities include instruction type identification
