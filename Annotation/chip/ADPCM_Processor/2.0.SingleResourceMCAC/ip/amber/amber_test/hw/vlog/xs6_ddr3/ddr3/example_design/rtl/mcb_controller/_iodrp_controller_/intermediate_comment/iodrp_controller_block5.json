    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for controlling the phase of an address in synchronization with the DRP clock. The activation of the synchronous reset ('sync_rst') signal clears the 'AddressPhase' flag. If not in a reset state, the block checks whether it's in an AddressPhase. If so, it stays in this phase as long as the device state is not 'ALMOST_READY'. Otherwise, it enters the AddressPhase when the system state is 'ADDR_PHASE' and when 'bit_cnt' equals to 7 (or 3'b111 in binary representation)."
