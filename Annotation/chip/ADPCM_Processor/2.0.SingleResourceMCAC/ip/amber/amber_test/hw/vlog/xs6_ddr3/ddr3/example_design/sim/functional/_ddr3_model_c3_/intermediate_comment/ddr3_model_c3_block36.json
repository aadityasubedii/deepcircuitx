    "block_comment": "This block of code performs negative edge detection on the 30th bit of the input data stream (`dqs_in[29]`). It does this by placing a procedural block(`always`), and specifying the 30th bit of `dqs_in` array on a negative edge event. When a negative edge is detected, the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function is called for the corresponding bit."
