    "block_comment": "The purpose of this block of code is to enable the data comparison for port 1 when the second position of the `C_PORT_ENABLE` register is set to 1. The implementation relies on an `else if` condition that verifies the status of the `C_PORT_ENABLE[1]`. If this value equals '1', the code block named 'port1_status' begins execution, and `cmp_data` is assigned the 32-bit data from `p1_cmp_data` ranging from bit 0 to bit 31."
