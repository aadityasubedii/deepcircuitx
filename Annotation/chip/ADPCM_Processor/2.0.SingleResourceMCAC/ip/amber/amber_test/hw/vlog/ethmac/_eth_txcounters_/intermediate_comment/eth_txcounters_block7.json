    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the 'ExcessiveDefer' signal based on a specific condition. The condition checks if the 14-bit 'NibCnt' value is equal to hexadecimal value '17b7' and if the 'ExDfrEn' signal is not enabled. If this condition is satisfied, the resultant value assigned to 'ExcessiveDefer' is true; otherwise, it is false."
