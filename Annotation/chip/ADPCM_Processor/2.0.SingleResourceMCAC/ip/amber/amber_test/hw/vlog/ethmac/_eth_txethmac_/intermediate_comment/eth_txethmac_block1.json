    "block_comment": "The block of code instantiates the `eth_random` module to generate a pseudorandom sequence. The module takes in a clock signal (`MTxClk`), a reset signal (`Reset`), a state jam signal (`StateJam`), a value of the previous state (`StateJam_q`), and a retry counter (`RetryCnt`). It also takes stylus and byte counters (`NibCnt` and `ByteCnt[9:0]`), and outputs a signal (`RandomEq0`) that monitors whether the sequence equals zero and a counter (`RandomEqByteCnt`) that tracks the number of bytes in the random sequence."
