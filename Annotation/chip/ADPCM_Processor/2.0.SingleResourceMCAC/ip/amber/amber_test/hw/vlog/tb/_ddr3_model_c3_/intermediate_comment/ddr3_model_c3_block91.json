    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed for performing an event-based timing check on the 40th bit of the given input, `dq_in`. This task is achieved by passing the corresponding bit index, `39`, into the `dq_timing_check` function whenever there's a state change in the considered bit, as signaled by the event control operator @. Thus, the block allows real-time monitoring and verification of the specific bit's timing characteristics in the `dq_in` data.\n"
