Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level interface for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) in a Xilinx FPGA design, supporting up to 6 ports with configurable AXI or native interfaces. It integrates various components including AXI interfaces, MCB raw wrapper, and optional BUFPLL for clock management. The module handles memory operations, arbitration, and clock management for DDR memory interactions. Key input ports include clock signals (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), reset (sys_rst), and multiple ports for command, write, and read operations (p0_cmd_* to p5_cmd_*, p0_wr_* to p5_wr_*, p0_rd_* to p5_rd_*). Output ports provide status information, memory interface signals, and responses for memory
