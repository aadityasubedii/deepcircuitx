    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages a write command force timeout counter. When a reset signal is detected or when the memory block end signal switch from high to low, the counter is reset. Conversely, when a force write command is generated, the counter increments. This is done synchronously with respect to the positive edge of the input clock. It's used to create a delay from the moment a write command is issued, until a time-out condition occurs and forces a write command operation. To achieve this, it relies on the clock signal, reset signal, wait block end signal, and the force write command generation signal."
