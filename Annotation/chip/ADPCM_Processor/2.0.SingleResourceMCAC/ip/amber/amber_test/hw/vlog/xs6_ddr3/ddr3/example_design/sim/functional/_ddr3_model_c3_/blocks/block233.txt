This block of code is responsible for capturing the edge-triggered change in `ck_in` signal. More specifically, this block waits for a rising edge (positive edge) on the `ck_in` signal and then assigns the current value of `ck_in` to the `diff_ck`. The operation is performed by the `always` statement in combination with the `@(posedge ck_in)` event control, and the `<=` non-blocking assignment ensures the values are updated all at the same time at the end of the simulation time step.
