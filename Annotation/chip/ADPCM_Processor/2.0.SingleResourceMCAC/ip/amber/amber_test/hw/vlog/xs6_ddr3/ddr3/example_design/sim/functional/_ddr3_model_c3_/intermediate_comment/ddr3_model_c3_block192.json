    "block_comment": "The block is a task named `dqs_odd_receiver` that handles DQS (Data Strobe) signaling in odd cycles for DDR data transfer. It receives a 4-bit input `i`, constructs a bit mask based on this input, and applies it to `dq_in` if `dqs_odd[i]` is true. The dual functionality is realized by examining the `tdqs_en` signal. If it's enabled, `dm_in_neg[i]` is set to zero; otherwise, it's set to `dm_in[i]`. The resulting data `dq_in_neg` is generated by logical bitwise AND and OR operations with the `bit_mask`."
