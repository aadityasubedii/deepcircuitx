The block of Verilog code defines a function for retrieving the value of a register, indicated by the passed register number. The implementation uses a switch-case statement (case-endcase block) that accepts the 5-bit register number as input and assigns the value from the respective register in U_REGISTER_BANK to the function's return value, get_reg_val. Each case corresponds to a different register (from r0_out to r15_out_rm and r14_svc to r15_out_rn).
