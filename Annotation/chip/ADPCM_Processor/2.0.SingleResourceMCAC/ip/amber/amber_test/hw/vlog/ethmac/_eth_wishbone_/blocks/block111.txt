Comment: 
This block handles the control signal settings for a transmission process in a Verilog-based system. On clock's positive edge or a high reset signal, it sets `TxEndFrm_wb`- a flag indicating the end of a transmission frame. On reset, it disables the flag. If the transmission length is zero, the buffer is almost empty and the used data is not zero, it activates the flag indicating a successful end of transmission. However, in case of a retry, complete transmission or an intentional abort, it deactivates the flag resetting it for future transmission processes.
