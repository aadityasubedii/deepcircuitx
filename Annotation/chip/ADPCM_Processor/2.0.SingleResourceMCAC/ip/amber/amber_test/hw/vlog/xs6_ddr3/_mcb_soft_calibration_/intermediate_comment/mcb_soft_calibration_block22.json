    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the transitioning of states in a Finite State Machine (FSM), with particular states being 'WAIT7', 'OFF_ZIO_NTERM', and 'WAIT8'. When in 'WAIT7' state, the FSM waits for 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' to be true before transitioning to 'OFF_ZIO_NTERM'. In the 'OFF_ZIO_NTERM' state, some control signal values are set and the FSM switches to the 'WAIT8' state if 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' is false. The states manage the control flow of the system, particularly in writing data to a memory cell."
