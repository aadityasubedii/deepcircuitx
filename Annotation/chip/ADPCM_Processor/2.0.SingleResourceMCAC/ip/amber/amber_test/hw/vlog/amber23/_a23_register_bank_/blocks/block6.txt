Comment: 
The purpose of this block of code is to assign register values based on the current execution mode. If the execution mode is `FIRQ`, the values of `r8_rds` to `r12_rds` are assigned from their respective `FIRQ` registers. For `r13_rds` and `r14_rds`, distinct register values are selected depending on whether the execution mode is `USR`, `SVC`, `IRQ`, or `FIRQ`. This implementation leverages Verilog's conditional ('?') operator for these value assignments, allowing mode-appropriate selection of register contents.
