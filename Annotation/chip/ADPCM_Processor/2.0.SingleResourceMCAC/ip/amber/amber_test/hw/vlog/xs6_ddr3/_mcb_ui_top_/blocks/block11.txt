Comment: 
This block is responsible for controlling multiple sets of clock signals and enables interfaces for a hardware component based on the condition of `C_S3_AXI_ENABLE` being zero. When `C_S3_AXI_ENABLE` equals zero, multiple in/out signals related to command instructions (`p3_cmd_*`), write instructions (`p3_wr_*`), and read instructions (`p3_rd_*`) are being assigned their equivalent internal signals. It is through these signals the block connects and communicates with other components.
