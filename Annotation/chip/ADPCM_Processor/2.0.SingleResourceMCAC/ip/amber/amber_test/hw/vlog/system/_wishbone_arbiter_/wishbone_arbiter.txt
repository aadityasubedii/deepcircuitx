Module-level comment: The 'wishbone_arbiter' module manages requests from multiple masters to access slave devices in a Wishbone interconnection. Two input parameters, `WB_DWIDTH` and `WB_SWIDTH`, define data and selection widths. The module chooses the current master and slave based on the input clock cycle and the master's address. The arbiter then delegates read or write operations and manages data, acknowledgment, and error signals between the master and the slave. The communication process is handled via specific control signals. Internally, registers and wires facilitate state holding and data transfer. Through efficient signal manipulation, the module ensures exclusive access of a slave device by one master at a time.
