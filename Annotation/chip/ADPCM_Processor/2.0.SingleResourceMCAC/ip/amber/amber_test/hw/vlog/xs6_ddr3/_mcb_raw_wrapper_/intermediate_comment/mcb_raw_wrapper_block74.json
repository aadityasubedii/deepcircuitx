    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code configures the memory interface (mig) of a 32-bit wide port and ensures data integrity during write operations. It conditionally assigns key signals when enable bit is set, linking write-enabled clk, data, mask, status, and count signals from the input port to the memory. If the port is not enabled, these signals are forcefully assigned to zero, ensuring no unwanted activity. Independent of the enable bit, read-related signals are assigned zero, indicating no read activities are supported on this port."
