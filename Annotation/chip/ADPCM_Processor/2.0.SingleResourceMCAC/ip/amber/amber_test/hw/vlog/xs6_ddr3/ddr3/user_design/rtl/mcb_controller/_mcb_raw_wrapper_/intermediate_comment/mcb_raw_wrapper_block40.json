    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog generates a set of signals for memory control, specifically when the 'C_CALIB_SOFT_IP' parameter is not set to \"TRUE\". The signals dictate how the hardware behaves on a clock event by assigning various inputs, outputs, and control signals to their corresponding signals in the memory control block (mcb). The system reset signal (int_sys_rst) is OR'ed with the inverse of the 16th bit of the 'wait_200us_counter' to produce the MCB system reset, while other signals such as mcb_ui_read, mcb_ui_add, mcb_ui_cs are directly tied to their corresponding signals. A feature is the self-refresh mode, which is permanently set to False within this generated block."
