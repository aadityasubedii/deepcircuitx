    "block_comment": "The code block is a state machine logic controlling the calibration and load regulation of some system, most likely Memory / DDR controller logic. Depending on the ready state (`IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N`), calibration completion (`MCB_UODONECAL`), and self-refresh request condition (`SELFREFRESH_REQ_R1`), it either proceeds to the dynamic calibration or reverts back to the initial state. Further, it incorporates a mechanism to skip dynamic input termination (`SKIP_DYN_IN_TERMINATION`) based on the last successful pass of dynamic calibration (`LastPass_DynCal`). Depending on this, it either loads an alternate form of termination (`LOAD_RZQ_NTERM`) or proceeds with further calibration (`WRITE_CALIBRATE`)."
