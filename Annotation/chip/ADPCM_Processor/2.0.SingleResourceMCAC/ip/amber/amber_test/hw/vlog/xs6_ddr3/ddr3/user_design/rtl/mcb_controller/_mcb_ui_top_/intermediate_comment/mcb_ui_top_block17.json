    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block establishes wire connections between interfaces. Specific implementation involves direct assignments, assigning the right-hand side variables to the left-hand side. Variables designated with \"_i\" suffix are likely representing internal wires, and these are assigned to their respective external exposed counterparts without \"_i\" suffix. This block appears to be managing read operations, as suggested by variable names like \"p1_rd_clk\" (likely a clock signal for read operations), \"p1_rd_en\" (indicating a read enable signal), etc. No complex logic is used in this block, only straight wire connections, indicating a pass-through function."
