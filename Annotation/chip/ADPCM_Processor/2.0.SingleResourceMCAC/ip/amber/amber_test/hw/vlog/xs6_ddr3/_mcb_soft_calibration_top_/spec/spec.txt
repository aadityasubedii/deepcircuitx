Module name: mcb_soft_calibration_top. 

Module specification: The mcb_soft_calibration_top module serves as the top module for Memory Controller Blocks (MCB) soft calibration in FPGA memory designs. It configures the calibration process based on parameters such as memory type, calibration mode, simulation, and others. The module instantiates another module 'mcb_soft_calibration' to perform the main unit of calibration with user interface communication through several input and output ports. It uses input ports such as UI_CLK, RST, IOCLK, PLL_LOCK, SELFREFRESH_REQ, SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE, MCB_UOSDO and further mentioned in the code. The output ports include DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL, SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ, SELFREFRESH_MODE, MCB_UIADD, MCB_UISDI, and other control and data signals for MCB, along with CKE_Train. There also are bidirectional pins such as RZQ_Pin and ZIO_Pin. Internal signals like IODRP_ADD, IODRP_SDI, RZQ_IODRP_SDO, ZIO_IODRP_SDO, and others serve their distinct roles inside the module. These include addressing, serial data inputs, and outputs tracking for equipment like IODRP, and the others described in the code. The main code sections include always block which is employed for registering the input signals on specific conditions, IOBUF block to connect the internal signals to pins, and IODRP2 instantiated for I/O DRP handling. The generate block is used to produce the IOBUF and IODRP2 for ZIO only in certain conditions. The execution and interaction between these code blocks establish the successful calibration procedure.
