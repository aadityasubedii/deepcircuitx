Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code is used for assigning the value of `gen_addr` to `cmp_addr_o`. The operation takes place continuously, meaning that if the value of `gen_addr` changes, the newly evaluated value will be immediately reflected in `cmp_addr_o`. This is achieved using the `assign` keyword, which designates continuous assignment in Verilog.
