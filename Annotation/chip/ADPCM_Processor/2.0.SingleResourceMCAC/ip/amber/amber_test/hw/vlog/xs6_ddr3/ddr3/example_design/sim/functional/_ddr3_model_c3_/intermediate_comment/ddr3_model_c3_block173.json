    "block_comment": "This block monitors for violations of the Timing Input High (tIH) and Input Pulse Width (tIPW) on the On-Die Termination (ODT) signal under regular operating conditions (not in self-refresh mode). The violations are tracked using system time. When the reset signal (rst_n_in) and ODT enable signal (odt_en) are active, it checks if the time elapsed since the last positive clock edge (tm_ck_pos) is less than tIH and since the last change of ODT (tm_odt) is less than tIPW. If either condition is violated, it displays a respective error message indicating the time and extent of violation. The time of last change of ODT (tm_odt) is updated after each evaluation."
