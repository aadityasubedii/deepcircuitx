Comment: 
This block of Verilog code assigns the output `TxDoneOut` depending on the value of the `CtrlMux` input. If `CtrlMux` is high, it implies that the transmission is controlled by an internal block, where `TxDoneOut` will be true only when `TxStartFrmIn` and `BlockTxDone` are both not active, and `MuxedDone` is active. However, if `CtrlMux` is low, the transmission is controlled externally, and `TxDoneOut` works the same way as the previous condition, but instead of `MuxedDone`, it depends on `TxDoneIn`.
