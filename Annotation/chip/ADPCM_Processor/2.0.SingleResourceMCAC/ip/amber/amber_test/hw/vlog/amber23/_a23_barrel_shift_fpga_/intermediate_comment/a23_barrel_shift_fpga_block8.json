    "block_comment": "The provided block of Verilog RTL code is used for right rotation (ror) operation on a 32-bit word. The `ror_out[0]` first checks if the immediate shift value is zero. If it is, `ror_out[0]` is assigned the value of the input carry, otherwise the bit at position 31 of the rotated output is assigned. For `ror_out[1]`, the process is slightly more complex. If the immediate shift value is zero, it's assigned `i_in[0]` and if the shift value is not zero, it's assigned `p_r[31]` otherwise it gets the value from the input carry in."
