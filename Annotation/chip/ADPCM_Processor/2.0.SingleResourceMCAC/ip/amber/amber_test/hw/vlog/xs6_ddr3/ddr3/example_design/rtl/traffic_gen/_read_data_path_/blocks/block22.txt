Comment: 
The block of code assigns a comparison data output (`cmp_data_o`) based on the type of FPGA family being used. If the FPGA family is `"SPARTAN6"`, `cmp_data_r3` is used as the comparison data output; otherwise, `cmp_data_r2` is used. This conditional assignment is achieved through the use of the ternary operator (`?:`) in Verilog, which lets the code route the data output depending on the specific hardware context.
