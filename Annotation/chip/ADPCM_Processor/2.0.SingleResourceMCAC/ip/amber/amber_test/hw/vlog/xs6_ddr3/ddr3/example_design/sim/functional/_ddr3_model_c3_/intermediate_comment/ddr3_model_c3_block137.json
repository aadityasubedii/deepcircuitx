    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to trigger a function-call everytime there's a change in the 11th bit of the dm_in signal. This block is implemented using an always statement which in Verilog RTL code is used to specify a persistent action. In this case, the action is a call to the dm_timing_check function with the parameter 10. The function is invoked whenever the monitored signal, i.e., the 11th bit (indexed at 10) of the dm_in bus, changes."
