    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the reception of PAUSE frames in an Ethernet MAC receiver. The block is predominantly governed by the rising edges of the `MRxClk` (MAC receiver clock) or `RxReset` signal. If a reset happens, `ReceivedPauseFrm` is set to 0. In normal operation, `ReceivedPauseFrm` is cleared (0) when a write latched status is received along with a `PassAll` signal or if a pause frame is previously received and `PassAll` is not asserted. Lastly, `ReceivedPauseFrm` is set (1) when a byte count equals 16, type of length is okay, and opcode is recognized as valid. These indicate that a valid PAUSE frame is identified."
