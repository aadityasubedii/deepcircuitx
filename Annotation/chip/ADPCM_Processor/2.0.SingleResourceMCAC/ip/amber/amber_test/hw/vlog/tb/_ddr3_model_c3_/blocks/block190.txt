Comment: 
This block of code is used for handling clock-edge triggered operations associated with the 'dqs_odd' array's second element. The block is implemented using an 'always' clause, which in Verilog allows it to execute whenever a positive edge (rising edge) is detected in 'dqs_odd[ 1]'. This triggers the 'dqs_odd_receiver' function with the parameter '1'.
