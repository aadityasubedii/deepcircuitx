It consists of eight 36-bit wide RAMB16BWER primitives, each configured as 512x32 bits. The module supports both read and write operations with a 128-bit data width and 10-bit address space. It allows byte-level write enables, providing granular control over data writes. The memory is split into two banks, selected by the most significant address bit, to achieve the full 1024-word depth. The module also includes parameters for initializing the memory contents."
