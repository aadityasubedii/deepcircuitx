    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'a23_fetch' module interfaces with the 'a23_cache' and 'a23_wishbone' subsystems within a CPU to manage data accesses. It validates input addresses and chooses the pathway for data fetch, based on cachability, cache enable signals and operating conditions. It facilitates the fetch operation by interfacing with 'a23_cache' for cacheable addresses (controlled by the 'sel_cache' signal), and with 'a23_wishbone' for non-cacheable addresses (controlled by the 'sel_wb' signal). It stalls the fetch operation if the system is not ready or receives stall signals. The 'a23_fetch' further supports write operations and privileged accesses."
