    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating the 'TxValidBytesLatched' register based on various signal conditions. If a reset signal is triggered, 'TxValidBytesLatched' is set to 0 right away. Subsequently, if the 'LatchValidBytes' is asserted but its previous state is not, it latches the 'TxValidBytes' into 'TxValidBytesLatched'. In cases where a transmission retry, done, or abort pulse is detected, the 'TxValidBytesLatched' is again reset to 0. The entire operation sequence is governed by the rising edge of 'WB_CLK_I' clock signal or a reset signal."
