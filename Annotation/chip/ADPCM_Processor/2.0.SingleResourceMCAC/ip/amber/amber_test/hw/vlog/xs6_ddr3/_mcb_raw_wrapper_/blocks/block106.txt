This block of code manages the normal operation mode of a system that can enter into a 'self-refresh' mode. The block listens for a positive edge on the 'ui_clk' signal, then checks for multiple conditions to determine the state of 'normal_operation_window'. If the system reset 'sys_rst' is asserted, it forces the system into normal operation mode. If the system is entering or is in self-refresh mode, it forces the system out of normal operation mode. If the system is not entering and not in self-refresh mode, it reasserts the normal operation mode. In any other cases, it maintains the current state of 'normal_operation_window'.
