    "block_comment": "The provided block of code is a delay element. This block is used to delay the signal 'odt' by a predefined duration defined by the parameter 'BUS_DELAY'. The delayed signal is then assigned to the output 'odt_in'. The always @ (odt) construct in this code implies that the block reacts to changes on the 'odt' signal, ensuring the output 'odt_in' reflects a time-delayed version of the same."
