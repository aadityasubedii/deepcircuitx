    "block_comment": "The Verilog RTL block defines a task `cmd_addr_timing_check` which performs timing checks on command and address inputs to ensure they adhere to timing specifications. The checks are performed only when there are no resets and 'prev_cke' is true. If the input 'i' is zero and the difference between current time and positive clock edge time is less than 'TIH', it throws an error for 'TIH' violation. A similar check is performed if 'i' is non-zero and 'cs_n_in' is zero. Additionally, it checks whether the difference between the current time and the execution time of the command or address is less than 'TIPW', throwing if so, an error for 'TIPW' violation. The execution time of the command or address is then updated to the current time."
