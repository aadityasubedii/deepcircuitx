    "block_comment": "This block configures IODRP2_MCB for Double Data Rate (DDR) memory operations. It sets up instances for accessing and controlling Data Query (DQ), strobe (DQS) signals, and data masks (DM). When the number of DQ pins is 4, two instances are created per DQ for master and slave setup. Each instance uses configuration parameters such as data rate, delay values and SerDes mode. These instances interact with I/O Control Block (IOCB) for write and read. For DQS, two separate instances for positive and negative parts and for mask signals (UDM, LDM), it sets up one instance each. Control signals (CLK, CS, ADD, MEMUPDATE) are used for DRP interface, IDATAIN input data and DOUT is the output. The operation is synchronized with 90-degree phased clock signal."
