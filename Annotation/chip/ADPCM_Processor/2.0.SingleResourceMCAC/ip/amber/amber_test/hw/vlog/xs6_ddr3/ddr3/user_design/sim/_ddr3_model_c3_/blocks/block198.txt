Comment: 
This block of code is performing a sampling operation on `dqs_even[10]` using a positive edge-triggered logic. The Verilog `always` statement executes whenever there is a positive-edge change (signaled by `@(posedge)`) in the `dqs_even[10]` signal. As soon as such a change is detected, the procedure `dqs_even_receiver` is called with `10` as an index, thereby enabling the reception of data from `dqs_even[10]`.
