    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily functions as an error checking mechanism for invalid commands on port 2. In detail, the block uses the bitwise AND operator to check for specific conditions in the 'C_PORT_CONFIG' configuration and 'p2_cmd_en' and 'p2_cmd_instr' input signals. If 'C_PORT_CONFIG[119:96]' equals \"W32\", 'p2_cmd_en' is enabled (equals 1), and if the second bit of 'p2_cmd_instr' is 0 but the zeroth bit is 1, then it's considered an invalid command for a write-only port. In that case, it outputs an appropriate error message and then terminates the simulation."
