    "spec": "Module name: generic_iobuf. \n\nModule specification: The generic_iobuf is a straightforward Input Output buffer module designed with Verilog RTL code. It receives, processes and delivers data through its input, output and inout ports. There are two input ports: 'I' is the data input that delivers the state of IO when the tri-state control 'T' is low, and 'T' determines whether the inout port IO drives a logic level or is at high impedance state. The 'O', an output port, always reflects the current state of the port IO. Additionally, 'IO', an inout port, functions both as an input or output depending on 'T', and its status is reflected to 'O' port. Although a more complex design might incorporate internal signals to perform operations or maintain states, this module doesn't require any such signals due to its simplicity. In essence, the core code comprises of two assignment statements. The first equates the output 'O' with the inout port 'IO', and the second determines the state of 'IO' based on the input ports 'T' and 'I'. This symbolizes the logic of the module, establishing the interrelationships between the ports.",
