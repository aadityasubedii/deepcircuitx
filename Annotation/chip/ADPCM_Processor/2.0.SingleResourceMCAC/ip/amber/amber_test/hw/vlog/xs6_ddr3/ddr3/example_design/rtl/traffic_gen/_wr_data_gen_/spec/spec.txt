Module name: wr_data_gen.

Module specification: The wr_data_gen is a versatile write data generator for the SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 families. Its primary operations revolve around command readiness, data validity, and data preparation during write operations. Additionally, it handles PRBS (Pseudo Random Bit Sequence), considering the burst length, user burst count, and fixed data input. 

This module has various input and output ports. Key input ports include clk_i for synchronization, rst_i to initiate the data generation process, prbs_fseed_i - a seed for PRBS data generation, data_mode_i for data mode specification, cmd_valid_i to cmd_validC_i indicating command validity/start, fixed_data_i serving as input data, addr_i for data allocation in memory, bl_i specifying the burst length, and data_rdy_i symbolizing data readiness for write operation. The notable output ports are cmd_rdy_o signaling command readiness, last_word_o to signal end of operation, data_valid_o indicating the validity of the output data, data_o - the output data, and data_wr_end_o implying the completion of a write operation.

Internally, the module uses signals like data for holding current data, cmd_rdy and cmd_start (from A-F) indicating readiness and start of different commands, burst_count_reached2, data_valid, user_burst_cnt (user burst count), and fifo_not_full denoting if the fifo memory is not full. Certain signals like u_bcount_2 and last_word_t have specific applications during certain states of the module.

The code can be broken down into a few key sections. The parameters area contains critical settings like FAMILY, DWIDTH, DATA_PATTERN, etc. Next, the various inputs and outputs are declared and followed by internal signals' definitions. Afterward, flip-flops are used to track and change state-related, data-related, and readiness signals. The core of the module is encapsulated in the generate blocks where specific data generators (sp6_data_gen and v6_data_gen) are invoked based on 'FAMILY' parameter. These data generators are responsible for the actual data outputs in accordance with set parameters. Finally, the endmodule token signifies the module's end.
