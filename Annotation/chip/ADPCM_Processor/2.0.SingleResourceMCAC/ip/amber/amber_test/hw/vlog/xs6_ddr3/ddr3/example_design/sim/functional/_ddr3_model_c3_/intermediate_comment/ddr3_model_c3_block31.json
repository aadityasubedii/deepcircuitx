    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a timing check function for the digital quaternary signal (DQS). The action is triggered on the negative edge of the second value in the `dqs_in` array using the 'always' keyword, which means this block continuously executes whenever the event (falling edge of `dqs_in[1]`) occurs. The `dqs_neg_timing_check(1)` function is then called to perform the timing check."
