    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a flip-flop that's sensitive to the rising edge of the input clock signal (clk_i). The flip-flop's output (u_bcount_2) is controlled by conditional logic -- it's set to 1 if the user_burst_cnt equals 2 and the FIFO is not full, or if cmd_startC is active and bl_i equals 1. Additionally, the output u_bcount_2 is set back to 0 if the last_word_o signal is active. This flip-flop with embedded logic helps in controlling the data flow in a system, most likely as part of a larger circuit dealing with data storage or transfer."
