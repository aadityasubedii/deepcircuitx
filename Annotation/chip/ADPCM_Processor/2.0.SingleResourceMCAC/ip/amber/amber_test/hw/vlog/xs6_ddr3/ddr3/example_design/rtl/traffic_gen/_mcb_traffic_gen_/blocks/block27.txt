This block manages the state of the write FIFO in a memory controller based on the FIFO's count and an external reset signal. The block is triggered by the rising edge of the input clock. If the reset signal is active, the FIFO is flagged as not full. However, if the FIFO count reaches 63, the block sets the FIFO as full, otherwise, the FIFO remains flagged as not full. This mechanism helps to prevent data overflows and ensure proper memory transactions.
