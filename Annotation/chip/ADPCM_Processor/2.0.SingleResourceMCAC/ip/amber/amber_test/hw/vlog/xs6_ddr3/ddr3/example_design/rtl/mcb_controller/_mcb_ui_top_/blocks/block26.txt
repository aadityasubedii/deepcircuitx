Comment: 
This block manages the selection of internal and external BUFPLL in a Spartan-6 FPGA for Memory Controller Block (MCB). If the `C_MCB_USE_EXTERNAL_BUFPLL` is not defined, an internal `BUFPLL_MCB` component is instantiated with dividers set to 2 and `LOCK_SRC` set to `LOCK_TO_0`. Its inputs and outputs are mapped to relevant signals, including reference clocks, locking, and strobe signals. The external BUFPLL option, is simply connections from the incoming reference clocks and lock signals to the corresponding signals in the design with no division or other operation.
