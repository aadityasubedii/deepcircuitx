Module name: wishbone_arbiter. 

Module specification: The module "wishbone_arbiter" acts as the design for a hardware arbiter in a Wishbone interconnection architecture. It manages the control signals between various masters and slaves. The arbiter routes the request from a specific master to a selected slave and ensures only one master can access a slave at a given time. Parameters `WB_DWIDTH` and `WB_SWIDTH` define data width and selection width respectively. The module also handles read from/write to operations based on the current master and current slave. The selection of both the current master and slave is done based on the `i_wb_clk` signal and the address range of various devices. Error and acknowledgment signals are managed through the arbiter.

Master input signals start with 'i_m' followed by the master number and signal type (adr for address, sel for selection, we for read/write, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe). Slave input signals start with 'i_s' followed by the slave number and signal type (dat for data, ack for acknowledgment, and err for error).

Master output signals start with 'o_m' followed by the master number and the signal type (dat for data, ack for acknowledgment, and err for error). Slave output signals start with 'o_s' followed by the slave number and the type of signal (adr for address, sel for selection, we for write enable, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe). 

Internally, signals starting with 'm' holds the state of each master, while signals `current_master` and `next_master` indicate the current and next master in line for accessing slaves. The `current_slave` signal selects the current slave. Signals `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`, `master_cyc`, and `master_stb` control the data transactions between current master and current slave. Signals `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, and `master_err` indicate the data read from the slave, successful operation, and error encountered respectively. 

In this module, `current_master` gets selected based on the clock cycle. Based on the selected master and address input, the `current_slave` is determined using a series of if conditions. Corresponding to each master-slave pair, different sets of assign statements are written to manage the data transfer by enabling certain signals, such as address, write enable, cycle signal, and strobe. The received data, acknowledgment, and error signals from the slave are generated for the master. The module ends with the assignment of acknowledgment, error, and data signals from the slave to the master. Overall, this module ensures efficient multi-master and multi-slave communication within the Wishbone interconnection architecture.
