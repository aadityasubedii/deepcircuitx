    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a function that updates a few register values on the positive edge of the DRP_CLK signal. When the system is in a \"READY\" state, the address of a memory cell, data to be written, and the read/write signal are stored into separate registers (`memcell_addr_reg`, `data_reg`, and `rd_not_write_reg`, respectively). These registers further possibly serve as inputs to other modules or processes in the hardware design."
