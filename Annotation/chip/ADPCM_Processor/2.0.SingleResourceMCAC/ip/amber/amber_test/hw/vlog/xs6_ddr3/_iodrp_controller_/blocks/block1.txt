Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code handles a specific state transition logic based on when the DRP_CLK signal is at the positive edge. When the clock is at the rising edge, and a synchronous reset (sync_rst) is triggered, it sets the state to the READY mode. Otherwise, if no reset is detected, the state is moved to the next state as defined by 'nextstate'. This block forms a part of a state machine's state transition function, where the state is advanced based on the clock and reset conditions.
