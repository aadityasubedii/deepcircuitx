    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the register `copro15_reg1_write` based on certain conditions. If the internal fetching process is not stalled (`!i_fetch_stall`), a coprocessor operation (`i_copro_operation`) equals '2' and the coprocessor register n (`i_copro_crn`) equals '1', then `copro15_reg1_write` becomes `true`. Otherwise, it is `false`. The assignment uses Boolean logic operators, enabling concurrent processing in hardware."
