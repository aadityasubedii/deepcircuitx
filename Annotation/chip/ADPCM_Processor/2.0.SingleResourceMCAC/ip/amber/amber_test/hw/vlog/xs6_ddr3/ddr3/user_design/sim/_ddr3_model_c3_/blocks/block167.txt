[Function of the Block] This block monitors the least significant bit (bit 0) of the 'ba_in' input signal and triggers the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function whenever this bit changes. [Implementation Details of the Block] The implementation uses the 'always' keyword to ensure that the monitoring of this bit is continuous and immediate. The 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function is called with a delay of four time units from the event that triggers it. This is ensured by passing '4' as an argument in the function call.
