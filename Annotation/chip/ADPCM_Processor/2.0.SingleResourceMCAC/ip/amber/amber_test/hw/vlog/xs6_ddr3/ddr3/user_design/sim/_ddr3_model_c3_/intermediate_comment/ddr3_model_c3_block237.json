    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for modeling the bus delay of a signal. It does this by using the always block to monitor changes in the signal 'dq'. When the 'dq' signal changes, the block assigns a delay of BUS_DELAY units to the 'dq' input to model real world physical delays that exist on buses in hardware systems. This is implemented in Verilog using the non-blocking '<=' assignment, which guarantees sequential assignments within a single time step."
