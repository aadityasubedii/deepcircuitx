This block generates a specific pattern used for data transfer when the number of data query pins equals 112 and the data pattern corresponds to either 'Neighbor', 'Walking 1', 'Walking 0', or 'All'. It does this through a conditional generation based on the defined constants for 'NUM_DQ_PINS' and 'DATA_PATTERN', effectively configuring the data pattern for the system's data transfer process.
