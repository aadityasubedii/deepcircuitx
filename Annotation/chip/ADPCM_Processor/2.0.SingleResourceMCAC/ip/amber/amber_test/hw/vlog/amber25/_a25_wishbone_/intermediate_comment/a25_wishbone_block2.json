    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a synchronous logic block to control serving ports and manage the write buffer (WB). At the rising edge of a reset or clock (clk) signal, the logic is triggered. If a reset signal is detected, the serving port and all WB-related output signals are reset to a default state. However, in the absence of a reset signal with a new access, the block checks the validity flags of the WB (wbuf_valid). Depending on the valid buffer, corresponding address (wbuf_addr), byte enables (wbuf_be), write enable (wbuf_write), and data (wbuf_wdata) are assigned to WB output signals. The cycle (o_wb_cyc) and strobe (o_wb_stb) signals are set to 1, indicating that a write cycle is in progress. The serving port is simultaneously updated. If no buffers are valid, the cycle, strobe, write enable, address, and data signals are reset and the serving port is also reset."
