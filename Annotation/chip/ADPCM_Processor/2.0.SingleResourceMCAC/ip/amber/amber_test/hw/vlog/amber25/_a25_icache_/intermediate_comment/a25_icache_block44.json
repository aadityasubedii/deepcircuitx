    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a hardware condition for an invalid memory read operation. It performs this by comparing the current read address (`address_r`) with the input address (`i_address`) and assigning the result to the signal `invalid_read`. If the two addresses are not equal, it signifies an invalid read operation, thus setting the `invalid_read` signal high.\n"
