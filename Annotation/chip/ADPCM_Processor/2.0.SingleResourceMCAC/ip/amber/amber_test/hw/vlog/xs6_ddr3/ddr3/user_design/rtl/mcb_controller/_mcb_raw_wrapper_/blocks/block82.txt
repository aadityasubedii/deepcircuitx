Comment: 
This block of code executes a conditional check on certain bit configurations and signals. It verifies if the C_PORT_CONFIG bits from 119 to 96 hold the value "R32", a read command is enabled through the 'p2_cmd_en' signal, and the 'p2_cmd_instr' signals are in the specified configuration for a possible write request. If these conditions are met, it denotes invalid operations as it indicates a write request to a read-only port ("port 2"), in which case, an error message is displayed and simulation will be terminated.
