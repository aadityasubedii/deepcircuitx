    "spec": "Module name: a25_alu. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe a25_alu module represents a 32-bit configurable Arithmetic Logic Unit typically used in computer processors. The module receives two 32-bit inputs, i_a_in and i_b_in, along with a 9-bit function code, i_function, which instructs the ALU to perform specific logic operations. In addition, there are two more inputs, i_status_bits_carry and i_barrel_shift_carry, which are used for handling carry in some operations.\n\nThe module produces a 32-bit output result of the operation, o_out, and flag signals, o_flags, which indicate conditions like overflow, zero, negative and carry. \n\nInternally, the module uses several signals such as a, b, b_not, etc to perform the requested operation. The operands 'a' and 'b' could be swapped based on i_function. Similarly, the operand 'b' can be bitwise complemented to b_not based on i_function. It also has specific signals to handle carry in (carry_in) and carry out (carry_out) operations and to detect overflow (overflow_out). \n\nIn the code, there are several sections used to assign appropriate values to operands a and b, carry in, and carry out. Further, there are sections to perform and/or/xor operations and to extend the value of b_not. The result of various operations could be selected as output based on the i_function. The module also handles device-specific operations for Xilinx FPGA devices. \n\nOverall, this module encapsulates a powerful and versatile ALU unit capable of conducting a range of arithmetic and logic operations, depending on the signal provided by i_function. Its configurability and provision for carry input and output make it suitable for use in a variety of processing applications, with comprehensive signaling to interface with other system blocks.",

                    "text": "Module name: a25_alu. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe a25_alu module represents a 32-bit configurable Arithmetic Logic Unit typically used in computer processors. The module receives two 32-bit inputs, i_a_in and i_b_in, along with a 9-bit function code, i_function, which instructs the ALU to perform specific logic operations. In addition, there are two more inputs, i_status_bits_carry and i_barrel_shift_carry, which are used for handling carry in some operations.\n\nThe module produces a 32-bit output result of the operation, o_out, and flag signals, o_flags, which indicate conditions like overflow, zero, negative and carry. \n\nInternally, the module uses several signals such as a, b, b_not, etc to perform the requested operation. The operands 'a' and 'b' could be swapped based on i_function. Similarly, the operand 'b' can be bitwise complemented to b_not based on i_function. It also has specific signals to handle carry in (carry_in) and carry out (carry_out) operations and to detect overflow (overflow_out). \n\nIn the code, there are several sections used to assign appropriate values to operands a and b, carry in, and carry out. Further, there are sections to perform and/or/xor operations and to extend the value of b_not. The result of various operations could be selected as output based on the i_function. The module also handles device-specific operations for Xilinx FPGA devices. \n\nOverall, this module encapsulates a powerful and versatile ALU unit capable of conducting a range of arithmetic and logic operations, depending on the signal provided by i_function. Its configurability and provision for carry input and output make it suitable for use in a variety of processing applications, with comprehensive signaling to interface with other system blocks."
