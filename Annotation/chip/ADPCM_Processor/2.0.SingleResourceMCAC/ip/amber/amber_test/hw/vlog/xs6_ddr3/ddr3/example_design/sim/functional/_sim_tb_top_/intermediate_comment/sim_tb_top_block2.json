    "block_comment": "This block instantiates a DDR3 memory, `u_mem_c3`, based on the number of DQ pins (`C3_NUM_DQ_PINS`). If the count is 16, it utilizes both upper and lower DQS and DM lines, whereas for lower counts, the model only uses the lower DQ data/strobe lines. This memory block facilitates handshake with DRAM via signal assignments like command (cas, ras, we), control (cke, cs), addressing, data, and data strobe (dqs) lines for read/write activity under different configurations encapsulated using a generate-conditional structure."
