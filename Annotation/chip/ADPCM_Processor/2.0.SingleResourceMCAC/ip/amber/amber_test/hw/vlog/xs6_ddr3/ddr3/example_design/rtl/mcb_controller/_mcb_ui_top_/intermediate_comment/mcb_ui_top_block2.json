    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for interfacing with the AXI bus and communicating with a Memory Controller Block (MCB). It automates read and write operations by providing an accessible interface to the MCB system. Firstly, address lines are masked, carving out the used portion of the AXI address space. Then, a synchronization module `mcb_ui_top_synch` is instantiated to synchronize the 'done_cal' signal and the output is assigned to 'calib_done_synch'. A core AXI-MCB interface module `axi_mcb` is instantiated with specific parameters like AXI widths, data widths, support flags, etc. It includes many signal assignments that link to system AXI signals related to data, address, ID, control flags, etc. The bottom portion of the code assigns the MCB output and control signals. These include clock, enable, data and error flags, each of which directly interfaces with both the AXI and the MCB."
