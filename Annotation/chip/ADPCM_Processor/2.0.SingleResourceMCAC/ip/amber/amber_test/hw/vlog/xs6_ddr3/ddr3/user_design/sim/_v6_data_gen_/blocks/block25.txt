This block of Verilog code is a conditional generate block which is used to instantiate certain logic structure based on the value of `NUM_DQ_PINS` and `DATA_PATTERN` parameters. If the number of data-query pins (`NUM_DQ_PINS`) equals 120 and the data pattern (`DATA_PATTERN`) equals any of the specified strings ("DGEN_NEIGHBOR," "DGEN_WALKING1," "DGEN_WALKING0," or "DGEN_ALL"), the code within this block will be generated. The operation within this block is triggered at the rising edge of input clock 'clk_i'.
