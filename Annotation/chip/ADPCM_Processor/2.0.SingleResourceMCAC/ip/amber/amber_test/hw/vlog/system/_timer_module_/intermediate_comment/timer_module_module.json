    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'timer_module' is a programmable timer module implemented in Verilog, comprising three timers (timer0, timer1, timer2) that count down from a given value to zero and generate interrupts upon reaching zero. It uses multiple internal registers to hold initial count values, current counts, control bits, and interrupt statuses for each timer. The module interacts with a Wishbone bus, handling data read and write operations. It also features sections for data width adjustment and debug information. The module's design ensures robust timer operation and data transactions for hardware applications."
