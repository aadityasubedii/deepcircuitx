Comment: 
The block of code controls the status of the Read pointer (`RxPointerRead`) within a system, using a Write Back Clock (`WB_CLK_I`) and a Reset signal. When reset is high, it sets `RxPointerRead` to 0 at the next positive clock edge (indicating no read operation). If `StartRxPointerRead` is set, `RxPointerRead` is set to 1, indicating the initiation of a read operation. If both `RxEn` and `RxEn_q` (probably previous state of `RxEn`) are true, it indicates that the reading is completed, therefore `RxPointerRead` is reset to 0. The transitions in `RxPointerRead` happen at the positive edge of `WB_CLK_I`, with a propagation delay of `Tp`.
