Comment: 
This block of code handles fault conditions in a clocked digital system. If a fault signal is present and there is no fetch stall, the system stores the information about the fault in the 'fault_status' and 'fault_address' registers on the rising edge of the clock. Vital in fault detection and debugging processes, it can optionally display fault status and address information when the A23_COPRO15_DEBUG mode is active.
