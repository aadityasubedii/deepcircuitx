    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the decision logic for memory type selection other than \"DDR2\". It uses a built-in conditional check \"if\" anchored inside a \"generate\" statement to dynamically adjust synthesis in the design time, according to the memory type represented by the variable C_MEM_TYPE. This function is implemented by evaluating the string comparison between the variable C_MEM_TYPE and \"DDR2\", and the labeled block 'gen_cketrain_b' is instantiated when the memory type is not \"DDR2\"."
