    "block_comment": "This block of code declares a concatenation assignment to the 'o_timer_int' output signal. This concatenation combines the status of three timer interrupt signals (timer2_int_reg, timer1_int_reg, and timer0_int_reg). These signals are grouped together as one entity, thus allowing the system to monitor or respond concurrently to the state of all three timers. The order is from timer2 (most significant bit) to timer0 (least significant bit)."
