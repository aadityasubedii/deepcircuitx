This block of code handles the case where a memory burst length of eight is specified. The block sequentially modifies portions of the 'w1data' variable based on the specified number of data pins (NUM_DQ_PINS). Each portion of 'w1data' beginning from the fourth segment down to the first is reassigned with a delay of 'TCQ' simulation time units, concatenating a segment of 'w1data' excluding the last four bits with the last four bits of 'w1data' from the respective segment.
