Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code activates a digital timing check mechanism for the 17th data bit (zero-indexed) of input data queue (dq_in). The `always` keyword is used to set a sensitivity list, meaning that this block is executed whenever there's a change in the 17th data bit of `dq_in`. It calls a user-defined function, `dq_timing_check`, with a constant 16 as a parameter, which means it is specifically monitoring the behaviour of this particular bit in runtime.
