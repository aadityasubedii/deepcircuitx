    "block_comment": "This block of code's function depends on the value of C_S5_AXI_ENABLE. If it's zero, the block simply assigns the internal signals to the respective inputs, keeping the hardware design unchanged. If it's non-zero, the block configures an AXI interface for an MCB (Memory Controller Block). It uses a top synchronous module and an AXI MCB module. The top synchronous module is used to ensure the calibration signal is synchronized to the axi clock domain. The AXI MCB module makes the MCB accessible over the AXI interface with proper address masking. Both modules are controlled by the AXI clock input and the reset signal. The data width of AXI interface is assigned as 32, which matches the standard AXI configurations."
