    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a conditional generator for type 'DDR2' memory in a Verilog RTL design. The block is implemented using the 'generate' and 'if' statements to conditionally include a section of code that will execute if 'C_MEM_TYPE' equals 'DDR2'. The label 'gen_cketrain_a' represents a named block scope of this conditional structure."
