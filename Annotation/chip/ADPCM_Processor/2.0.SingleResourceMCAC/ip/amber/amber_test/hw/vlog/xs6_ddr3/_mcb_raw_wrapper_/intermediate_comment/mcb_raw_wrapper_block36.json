    "block_comment": "This block of code controls a 200 microsecond wait timer. The timer relies on a counter `wait_200us_counter`, and when both the 14th and 13th bits of this counter are high, indicating that 200 microseconds elapsed, `wait_200us_done_r1` is set to high. If not, `wait_200us_done_r1` is set to low. On every positive edge of the user interface clock `ui_clk`, the value of `wait_200us_done_r1` is then assigned to `wait_200us_done_r2`, which could be used in other parts of the system interacting with this timer block.\n"
