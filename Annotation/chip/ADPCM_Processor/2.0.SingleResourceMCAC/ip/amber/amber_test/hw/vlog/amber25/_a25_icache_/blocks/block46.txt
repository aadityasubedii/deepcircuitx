The block of code is designed to handle reset and idle states in a system. Upon a rising edge of reset signal, the 'miss_address' register is set to decimal zero, effectively resetting the value. Whereas, when the system state is idle, represented by 'c_state == CS_IDLE', the miss_address register is updated with the incoming address, 'i_address', on the rising edge of the clock signal. This mechanism facilitates address tracking on idle state thereby preparing for the next active cycle.
