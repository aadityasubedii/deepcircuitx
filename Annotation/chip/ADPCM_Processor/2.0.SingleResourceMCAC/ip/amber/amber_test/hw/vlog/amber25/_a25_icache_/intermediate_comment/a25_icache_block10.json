    "block_comment": "This block of code declares a wire named xSOURCE_SEL. The wire is bit-wise defined with a width of (6*8)-1:0, meaning it is 48 bits wide. This block is essentially reserving a 48-bit wide wire in hardware, which can be used for transferring 48 bits of parallel data from one module to another in the same clock cycle."
