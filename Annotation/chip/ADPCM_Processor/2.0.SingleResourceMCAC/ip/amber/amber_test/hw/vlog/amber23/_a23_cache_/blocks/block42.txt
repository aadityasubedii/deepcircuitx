Comment: 
This block of Verilog code performs selective byte write operation on a word based on a 4-bit enable signal. If the enable signal is a specific value, the corresponding bytes from the input data are overwritten onto the output data at the correct positions. The rest of the bytes are left as they were in the original word. For instance, if the enable signal is '0001', the least significant byte of the input data replace the least significant byte of the output data, and the rest of the bytes are taken from the output data. If the condition does not match any case, the input data is returned as is.
