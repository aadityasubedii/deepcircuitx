    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates an always block which insists on a continuous monitoring of pin dm_in[11]. Whenever there is a change in the value at dm_in[11], this triggers the dm_timing_check function at index 11. The function's role is to ensure that the timing check for the digital signal at the given dm_in index, in this case, 11, is performed. Consequently, this setup ensures an as-per-need timing check for the signal on a change-detection basis."
