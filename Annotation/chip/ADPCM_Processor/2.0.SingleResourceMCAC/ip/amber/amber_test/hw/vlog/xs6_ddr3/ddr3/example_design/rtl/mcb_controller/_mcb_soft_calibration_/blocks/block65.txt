Comment: 
This block of code is part of a state machine handling a dynamic calibration process in a digital logic circuit. The described operation gets triggered by a positive edge of the User Interface Clock (UI_CLK). If a reset signal (RST) is high, the circuit moves to the initial state by setting 'State_Start_DynCal' to zero. If in the 'START_DYN_CAL' state, it maintains this state by setting 'State_Start_DynCal' as one, while in any other cases, it sets 'State_Start_DynCal' back to zero to resume normal operation.
