    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily functions as a timing check module for DQS (Data Strobe) signals in memory interfaces. It triggers on the positive edge of the 11th DQS signal line on the data bus and calls the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function with 11 as its argument. The mechanism of operation includes inferring latch or flip flops to hold data, which is then analyzed by the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function for timing related irregularities or errors."
