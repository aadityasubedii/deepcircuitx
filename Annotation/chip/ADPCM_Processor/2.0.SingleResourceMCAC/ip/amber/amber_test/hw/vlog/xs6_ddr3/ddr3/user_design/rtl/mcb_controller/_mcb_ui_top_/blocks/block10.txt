This block of Verilog RTL is a hardware interface which handles data flow between hardware components when the S3 AXI (ARM AMBA AXI specifications) bus is disabled. The block consists of read and write commands, clocks, enable signals, status flags and data buffers for three different instances: command filters, write channels and read channels. The status flags include indicators for full, empty, count, underflow, overflow and error conditions, providing robust control and status monitoring of data flow.
