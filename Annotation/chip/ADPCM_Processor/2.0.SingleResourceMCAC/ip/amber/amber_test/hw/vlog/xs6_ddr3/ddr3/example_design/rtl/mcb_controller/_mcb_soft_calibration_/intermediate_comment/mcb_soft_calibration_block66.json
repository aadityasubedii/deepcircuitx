    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for enabling wait count under specific conditions. Functioning on the positive edge of the user interface clock `UI_CLK`, it sets the `WaitCountEnable` flag to 0 during a reset `RST` or when `SELFREFRESH_REQ_R1` is high and `SELFREFRESH_REQ_R2` is low, disabling the wait count. However, when a dynamic calibration needs to be executed right after a self-refresh (`PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH_R1` is high and `PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH` is low), it sets the `WaitCountEnable` flag to 1. This conditional-mutability of `WaitCountEnable` is maintained within a clock cycle."
