It accepts inputs for write data, write enable, memory address, and byte enable signals. If the write enable signal is high, the data is written to the specified memory address. The byte enable signal is used to select which byte to be written to. On each rising edge of the clock, if the write enable is off, the module outputs the data located at the specified memory address. The module also supports reset functionality, where it can either initialize all memory values to zeroes or keep them intact based on the INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO parameter. Also, it includes test mode and scan functionalities for testing purposes."
