Comment: 
This block of code serves as a data writing operation trigger in the Verilog-based digital system. It uses bitwise operations on two inputs, `WCtrlDataStart_q1` and `WCtrlDataStart_q2`, to determine the output `WriteDataOp`. The value of `WriteDataOp` is true (1) only when `WCtrlDataStart_q1` is true and `WCtrlDataStart_q2` is false, basing on the AND and NOT operations respectively.
