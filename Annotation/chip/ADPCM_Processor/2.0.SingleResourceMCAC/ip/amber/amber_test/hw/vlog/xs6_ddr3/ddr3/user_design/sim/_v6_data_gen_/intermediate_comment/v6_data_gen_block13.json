    "block_comment": "This Verilog block manages the generation of data patterns depending on the number of Data Query (DQ) pins and the specific data pattern type defined. Specifically, it checks if the number of DQ pins is 144 and if the data pattern type falls under \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\". If both conditions are met, it moves into the block labelled \"WALKING_ONE_144_PATTERN\". The purpose of this design is to likely side-step unnecessary computations or segmentation faults when the conditions for the specific pattern generation aren't met."
