    "block_comment": "This block of code handles reset and read data count update functionality in a Verilog code. At a rising edge of the clock signal 'clk_i', if reset 'rst_i' is active, it resets the 'rd_data_counts_asked' to zero. Alternatively, if the 'cmd_en_i' (command enable) is high, and the least significant bit of 'cmd_sent' equals 1, it increments 'rd_data_counts_asked' by the value of 'bl_sent' plus one, encapsulated within a defined timing constraint \"#TCQ\"."
