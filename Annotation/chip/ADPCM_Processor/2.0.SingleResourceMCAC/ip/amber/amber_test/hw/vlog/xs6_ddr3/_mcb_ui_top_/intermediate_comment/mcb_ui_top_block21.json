    "block_comment": "This block is a user-defined function with the name 'rr', used to configure ports according to input options and assign them unique IDs. This function takes in three inputs: 'port_enable', which likely specifies which ports are active; 'port_config', which defines the maximum number of available ports via case statement; and 'slot_num', which is used in a final bitwise function 'blso'. The function computes the number of active ports through a loop, and subsequently assigns each active port a unique three-bit identifier within an 18-bit word 'rr'. It manages port configuration for different cases and ensures the ports are properly labeled and ready for use within a larger system."
