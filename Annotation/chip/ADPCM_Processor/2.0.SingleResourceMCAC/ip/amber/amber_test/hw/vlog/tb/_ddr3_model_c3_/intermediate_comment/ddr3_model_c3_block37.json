    "block_comment": "This block of code monitors the falling edge of the `dqs_in[28]` signal and calls the `dqs_pos_timing_check(28)` function. The always block is triggered on every negative edge of the `dqs_in[28]` signal, meaning it executes whenever `dqs_in[28]` transitions from a logic high state to a logic low state. At each negative edge, it invokes the function `dqs_pos_timing_check(28)`, passing an argument of 28."
