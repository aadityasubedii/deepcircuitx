Comment: 
This Verilog block is responsible for synchronizing the "ddr_calib_done" signal with the system clock, `o_sys_clk`. The block continually listens for rising edges on the system clock or a temporary reset signal, `rst_tmp`, and accordingly updates a registered variable ‘ddr_calib_done_sync_r’. On a reset signal, the register `ddr_calib_done_sync_r` is set to zero, while on a clock signal, the register shifts one position to the left and appends the current state of the 'ddr_calib_done' signal, effectively creating a running history of the 'ddr_calib_done' signal's state.
