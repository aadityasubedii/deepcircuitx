The function of this block of code is to synchronize the SetRxCIrq signal to the system clock and reset it with the rising edge of the reset signal. In terms of implementation, the block is implemented using a sequential always block in Verilog which gets triggered at the positive edges of 'Clk' or 'Reset' signals. If the reset signal is active, SetRxCIrq_sync2 is asynchronously set to 0 with a delay referenced by Tp. Otherwise, the value of SetRxCIrq_sync2 follows the value of SetRxCIrq_sync1 after a delay referenced by Tp.
