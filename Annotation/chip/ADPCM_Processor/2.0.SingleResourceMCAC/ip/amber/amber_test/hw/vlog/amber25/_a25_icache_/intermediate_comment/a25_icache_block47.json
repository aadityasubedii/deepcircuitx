    "block_comment": "This Verilog block defines a state machine, which processes the cache lines for a CPU. The actions within the state machine occur on the positive edge of either a reset or clk signal. When the system is reset, the machine is set to an idle state (CS_IDLE) with an initial source selection (source_sel), initial count (init_count), chosen way (select_way) and random number (random_num). When cache is flushed (i_cache_flush activated), the state machine is set to initiation mode (CS_INIT). Depending on the current state, the state machine can be used to increment the count of initialized caches (CS_INIT), handle cache misses (CS_IDLE), select the way (ring method) and generate a random number for next cycle reference (CS_FILL3), mark a fill as complete and return the source selector to the core for more assignments (CS_FILL_COMPLETE), and return to idle state after executions (CS_TURN_AROUND). These controls are crucial in operating and optimizing the performance of a CPU's cache."
