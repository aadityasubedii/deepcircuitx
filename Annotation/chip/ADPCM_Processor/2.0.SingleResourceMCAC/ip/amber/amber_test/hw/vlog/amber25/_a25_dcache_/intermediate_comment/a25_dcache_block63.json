    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a register update mechanism primarily handling the 'miss_address'. Upon positive edge of reset or clock signals, the \u2018miss_address\u2019 variable is updated. If the reset signal is active, 'miss_address' is reset to decimal 0. However, when the reset signal is inactive, but either 'o_wb_cached_req' is true, indicating a cache miss from the write buffer, or 'write_hit' is true, indicating a successful write operation, 'miss_address' gets updated with the input address, 'i_address'."
