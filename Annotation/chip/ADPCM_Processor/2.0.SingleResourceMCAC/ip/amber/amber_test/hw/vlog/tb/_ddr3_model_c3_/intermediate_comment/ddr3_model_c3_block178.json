    "block_comment": "This block is designed to activate the dqs_odd_receiver function when there is a positive edge in the 14th bit of the dqs_odd signal. It is implemented with an always block that triggers on every positive edge of the 14th bit of the dqs_odd signal, a common strategy in hardware description languages like Verilog to handle event-driven functionality. This could be part of a larger system that cares about changes in this specific bit of the signal."
