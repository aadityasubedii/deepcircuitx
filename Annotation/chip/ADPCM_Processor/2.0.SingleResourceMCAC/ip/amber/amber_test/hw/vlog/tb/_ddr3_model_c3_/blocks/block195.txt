This snippet of Verilog code is responsible for launching the function `dqs_even_receiver` for the 14th bit (indexed as 13) of the `dqs_even` array, whenever there is a rising edge (any increase in voltage level) detected. The code is implemented using an always block, ensuring `dqs_even_receiver(13)` is continuously monitored and activated once a specific condition, the positive edge of the `dqs_even[13]`, is met.
