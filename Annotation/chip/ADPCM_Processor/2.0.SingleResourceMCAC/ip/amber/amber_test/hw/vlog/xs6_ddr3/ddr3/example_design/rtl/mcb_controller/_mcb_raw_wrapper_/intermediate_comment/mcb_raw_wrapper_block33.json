    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the CKE (Clock Enable) signal during training. It is implemented as a sequential logic with `int_sys_rst`, `wait_200us_done_r1`, `wait_200us_done_r2`, and `uo_done_cal` as controlling conditions. Upon system reset (`int_sys_rst`), the `cke_train_reg` is cleared. If a 200us wait period is over indicated by `wait_200us_done_r1` and `wait_200us_done_r2`, `cke_train_reg` is set. This flag is again cleared when calibration (`uo_done_cal`) is complete."
