    "block_comment": "This block of code is a conditional branching block activated when the variable 'WAYS' is equal to 8, indicating an 8-way set associative cache configuration is in use. Named 'check_hit_8ways', the block would contain implementation details specifying the operations performed for a cache hit under an 8-way set associative cache memory system. The specific operations performed by the system in this configuration will be detailed in the subsequent lines of code within this block."
