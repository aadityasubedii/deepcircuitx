Module name: a25_core. 

Module specification: The a25_core module is an ARM CPU design implemented in Verilog RTL code. It consists of several child modules including fetch, decode, execute, memory, write-back, wishbone interface, and co-processor functions, forming a five-stage pipeline CPU. This CPU follows a fetch-decode-execute-memory-write_back sequence, which is a typical architecture for RISC CPUs like ARM. 

The module takes clock and reset inputs to drive and initialize the system respectively. It supports testing modes through scan_in, scan_enable, and test_mode inputs. The handling of interrupts is managed through input ports i_irq and i_firq. Signals for enabling or disabling cache management are provided through the cache_enable, cache_flush and cacheable_area signals. 

The module defines input and output ports for Wishbone bus interface which is a standard bus architecture for interfacing with memory and I/O systems. The module also defines several internal signals which facilitate communication between various stages of the instruction execution pipeline for controlling flow, managing cache, handling interrupts and exceptions, and managing other relevant operations including those from the co-processor.

The a25_core code is fundamentally organized into several subsystems pertaining to different stages of CPU instruction execution pipeline - fetching (`a25_fetch`), decoding (`a25_decode`), execution (`a25_execute`), memory operations (`a25_mem`), writing back (`a25_write_back`), interfacing with memory and I/O systems (`a25_wishbone`) and coprocessor operations (`a25_coprocessor`). Each of these subsystems is carefully coordinated via the module's internal signals to function together as a synchronized, efficient CPU core implementing ARM instruction set architecture.
