    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block is a conditional check statement for data yield mode scenarios, within a generated code construct. This system-specific, conditional check implementation determines which data generating pattern will be used based on the number of 'NUM_DQ_PINS' defined, and the predefined 'DATA_PATTERN' modes. If 'NUM_DQ_PINS' is equal to 80, and the data pattern is either 'DGEN_NEIGHBOR', 'DGEN_WALKING1', 'DGEN_WALKING0' or 'DGEN_ALL', then this specific data yield case for 80 pins will be triggered."
