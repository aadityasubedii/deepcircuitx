    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the control logic for setting the Pause signal in a transmission module. This operation happens on the rising edge of either the MTxClk clock signal or the TxReset signal. If TxReset is logic high, the Pause signal is asynchronously reset to zero after a delay specified by Tp. Otherwise, if the transmission is either done (TxDoneIn), has abruptly stopped (TxAbortIn), or hasn't detected data being used out (represented by negation of TxUsedDataOutDetected), and there's no outgoing start frame signal (~TxStartFrmOut), the Pause signal is then set to the logical AND between RxFlow and the inverse of PauseTimerEq0_sync2 after a delay specified by Tp.\n"
