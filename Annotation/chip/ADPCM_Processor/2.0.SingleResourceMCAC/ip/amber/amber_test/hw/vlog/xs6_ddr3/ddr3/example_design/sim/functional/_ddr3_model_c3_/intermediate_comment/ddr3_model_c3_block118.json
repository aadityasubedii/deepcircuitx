    "block_comment": "This block of code is a statement for a synchronous event in Verilog, specifically dealing with signal 'dq_in' at the 13th bit. It invokes 'dq_timing_check' function whenever there's a change in the value of the 13th bit of 'dq_in'. The use of 'always @' creates a procedural block that will be triggered on every edge (either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transition) of 'dq_in[12]'. This operation is particularly useful for monitoring and managing timing and edge-related events in a digital design."
