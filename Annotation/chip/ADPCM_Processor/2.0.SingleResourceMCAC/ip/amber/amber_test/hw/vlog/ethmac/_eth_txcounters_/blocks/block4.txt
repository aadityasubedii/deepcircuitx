Comment: 
This block is a 16-bit asynchronous and synchronous counter (ByteCnt). On the positive edge of the MTxClk signal or when Reset is high, the block resets the ByteCnt register to zero. However, under normal operation (when Reset is not high), the block checks the ResetByteCnt control signal. If ResetByteCnt is high, the ByteCnt register is cleared. If ResetByteCnt is not high but IncrementByteCnt is high, the ByteCnt register is incremented by one.
