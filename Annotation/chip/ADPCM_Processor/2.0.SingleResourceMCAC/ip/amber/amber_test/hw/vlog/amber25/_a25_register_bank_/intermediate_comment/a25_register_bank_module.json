    "module": "Module-level comment: Module 'a25_register_bank' acts as a register bank for a processor, managing different operating modes (e.g., interrupts) and handling writing/reading operations. It uses clock signals for synchronization and leverages signals like 'i_core_stall' and 'i_mem_stall' to manage stalls. Data registers (r0 to r15), mode-specific registers (like r13_svc, r14_irq), communication registers, and enable signals constitute primary internal signals. Implementation involves clock-triggered always@ blocks to update the register states, assign statements to govern data flow, and case statements to direct execution control flow based on operating conditions."
