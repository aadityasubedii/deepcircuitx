The block of code is designed to sample and hold the 'wb_start_read' signal at the rising edge of the 'i_clk' signal. It signifies a common behavior in synchronous digital design where the value of an input (in this case 'wb_start_read') is captured and held until the next rising edge of the clock ('i_clk'). It is implemented using a non-blocking assignment which ensures sequential updating on clock edges, typically used for flip-flops and clocked registers in Verilog.
