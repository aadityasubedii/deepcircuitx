This block implements a system reset function for a memory control interface. It is driven by the user interface clock (UI_CLK). On a positive edge of UI_CLK, if the signal RST_reg is high, all registers including MCB (Memory Control Block) command and address registers, IODRPCTRLR (IO Drive Control) registers, termination resistors' registers, DQS (Data Strobe Signal) delay counters, and various command and address stages, are reset to their default states. The implementation also sets the system state to the start point with the STATE register. The reset operation ensures that the interface starts operation from a known, predictable state.
