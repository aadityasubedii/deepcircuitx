Comment: 
This block of code represents a transmission control procedure in a digital communication system. It orchestrates the start of a transmission frame based on various conditions. The operations are conducted in synchronisation with a positive edge, clock signal (WB_CLK_I) or upon receiving a reset signal. On a reset or when a previous transmission frame completes (TxStartFrm_syncb2 is high), it resets the 'TxStartFrm_wb' signal. If the transmitter buffer is ready for data (TxBDReady) and no transmission has started (StartOccurred) and either the buffer is full (TxBufferFull) or the length of data equals zero (TxLengthEq0), it initiates a transmission event by setting 'TxStartFrm_wb' high. This block of code implements event-driven transmission control according to buffer occupancy conditions.
