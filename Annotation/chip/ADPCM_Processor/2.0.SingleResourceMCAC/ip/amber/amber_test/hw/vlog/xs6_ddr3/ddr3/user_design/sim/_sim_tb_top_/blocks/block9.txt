Comment: 
This block initializes a non-blocking assignment of the signal 'c3_sys_clk' to 'c3_sys_clk_p'. The purpose of this line is to create an alias signal that mirrors the behavior and value of 'c3_sys_clk'. This is accomplished using the 'assign' keyword, indicating that the right-hand signal value 'c3_sys_clk' should always be assigned to the left-hand signal 'c3_sys_clk_p', establishing a continuous assignment relationship.
