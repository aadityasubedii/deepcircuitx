    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a timing check on the 56th bit of the input data (dq_in). It triggers the function dq_timing_check every time there's a change in the state of dq_in[55]. The function dq_timing_check is passed the value 55, indicating that we are specifically interested in the 56th bit of the data. This functionality is achieved through Verilog's always keyword, which effectively sets up a continuous monitor on its sensitivity list, in this case dq_in[55]."
