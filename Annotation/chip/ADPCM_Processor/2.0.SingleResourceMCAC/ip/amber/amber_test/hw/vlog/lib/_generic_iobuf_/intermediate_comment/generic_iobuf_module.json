    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, generic_iobuf, is a basic Input Output buffer designed using Verilog RTL. It consists of two input ports 'I' and 'T', an output port 'O', and an inout port 'IO'. The functionality is achieved through two assignment operations: 'O' is continuously reflecting IO's state, and IO's state is determined by 'I' when 'T' is low and stands at high impedance otherwise. This module does not require any internal signals due to its simplicity."
