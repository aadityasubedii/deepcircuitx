    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a process (always block) that is triggered on the positive edge transition (rising edge) of the signal 'dqs_in[24]'. Upon every rising edge of this signal, the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' is invoked with parameter '24'. The purpose of the function is presumably timing verification, specifically when the signal 'dqs_in[24]' transitions from low to high (positive edge)."
