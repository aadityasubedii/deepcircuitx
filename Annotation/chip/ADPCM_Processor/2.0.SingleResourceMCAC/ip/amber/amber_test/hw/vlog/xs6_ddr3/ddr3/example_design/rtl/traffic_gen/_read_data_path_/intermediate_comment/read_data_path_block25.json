    "block_comment": "The block of code is performing a continuous assignment operation. Specifically, it assigns the value of the signal 'rd_mdata' to 'rd_mdata_o'. This means that whenever the value of 'rd_mdata' changes, 'rd_mdata_o' immediately takes on the new value. This kind of operation is used when we want to ensure that two signals share the same value throughout the operation of the circuit. It does not involve any clock signal, which makes it asynchronous, thereby providing immediate update of signal values."
