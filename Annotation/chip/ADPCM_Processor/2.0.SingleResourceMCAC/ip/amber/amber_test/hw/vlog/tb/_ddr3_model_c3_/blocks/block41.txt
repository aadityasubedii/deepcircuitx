Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code in an always block serves the purpose of timing check. Specifically, it checks for a negative edge of the data quantum stipulation (dqs_in[24]) and then activates a function called 'dqs_pos_timing_check' with 24 as the input parameter on the occurrence of each negative edge. The function dqs_pos_timing_check is activated synchronously with the negedge trigger of dqs_in[24], serving as a digital control signal in the design process, while 24 indicates the associated bit index. The specific implementation of what takes place within the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function is not shown in this excerpt.
