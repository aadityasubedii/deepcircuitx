This block is responsible for managing the read pointer for a given register or memory block. The read pointer is reset to 0 every time a reset signal is detected, ensuring the pointer is correctly positioned at the start of the read process post-reset. When a clear signal is received, the read pointer is set to the "read" position, if it's not already there. If neither reset or clear signals are active and the "read" command is given with the "empty" flag not set, the read pointer gets incremented, allowing the next piece of data to be read on the following clock cycle.
