These registers also allow reading the fault status and address.\n\n6. copro15_reg1_write: This is a wire which signals when a write operation to a specific register (coprocessor register 1) is commanded.\n\n   Explanation: This signal is set high when a write operation to coprocessor register 1 is being performed.
