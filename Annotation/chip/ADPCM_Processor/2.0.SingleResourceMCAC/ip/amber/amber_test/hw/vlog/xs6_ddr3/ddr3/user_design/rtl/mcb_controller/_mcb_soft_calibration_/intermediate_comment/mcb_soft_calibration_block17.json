    "block_comment": "The block manages the behavior of the RST_reg register based on the system clock (UI_CLK) and reset signal (non_violating_rst). When there's a positive edge trigger on either the UI_CLK or non_violating_rst, the block sets the RST_reg to 1 if the non_violating_rst is high or the 16th bit of the WAIT_200us_COUNTER is zero. If neither condition is met, RST_reg follows the value of rst_tmp."
