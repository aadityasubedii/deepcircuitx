    "block_comment": "This block initializes a conditional generate statement based on the predefined FPGA FAMILY type. Specifically, it checks if the FPGA FAMILY is \"VIRTEX6\". If the condition is met, a label \"INC_COUNTS_V\" is assigned to the following block of logic. This label allows for selective instantiation of design blocks based on the target FPGA fabric, optimizing for different hardware characteristics."
