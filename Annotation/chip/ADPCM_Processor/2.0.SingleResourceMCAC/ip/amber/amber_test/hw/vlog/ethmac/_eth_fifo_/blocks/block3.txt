This block of Verilog code is handling flag assignments for a FIFO queue. The 'empty' flag signals when the FIFO queue is empty, achieved by bitwise negation of the 'cnt' (count of items in the queue). The 'almost_empty' flag signals when there is only one thing left in the queue as determined by checking if 'cnt' is 1. The 'full' flag signals when the queue is full, asserted when 'cnt' is equal to the defined DEPTH of the queue. Finally, 'almost_full' flag is raised when the least three significant bits of 'cnt' are all 1s, denoting the queue is nearly full.
