It's designed to handle data and address phases to push data in or out of the memory unit. The module handles both write and read requests and is controlled mainly by the DRP_CLK, sync_rst, rd_not_write, and cmd_valid signals. It also allows the use of broadcast functionality. Furthermore, it includes safety measures such as resetting to default state when failure occurs. The output/in-transit data can be accessed via shift_through_reg register, which collects bits serially whenever DRP_CLK is activated. The actual state of the FSM is stored in the state variable, with transition being determined by the conditions in the always block with the state-switch case structure. Various phases exist in the FSM including READY, DECIDE, ADDR_PHASE, DATA_PHASE, and ALMOST_READY among others, for proper flow control."
