    "block_comment": "The code block functions to set the value of the signal `SetReadTxDataFromMemory`. This value gets set when the 'transmit enable' signal (`TxEn`), the delayed 'transmit enable' signal (`TxEn_q`) and the 'transmit pointer read' signal (`TxPointerRead`) are all active. This operation occurs by making use of bitwise AND operator, which results in a logical high state only when all input signals are high, thus controlling the data setting operation for the transmission path from memory."
