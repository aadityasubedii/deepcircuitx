    "block_comment": "The block of code controls a register update on a memory command bus (MCB). On every rising edge of the clock (clk_i), if the MCB command enable signal (mcb_cmd_en_i) is high, the MCB command address (mcb_cmd_addr_r) is updated with the input address (mcb_cmd_addr_i). Thus, this block uses a clock signal to time the update and a command enable signal to conditionally control the address updating on the MCB."
