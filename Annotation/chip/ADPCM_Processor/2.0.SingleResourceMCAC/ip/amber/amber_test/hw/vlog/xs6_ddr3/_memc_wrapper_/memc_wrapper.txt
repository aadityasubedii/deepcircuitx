Module-level comment: 
/*
 * Memory Controller Wrapper (memc_wrapper)
 * 
 * This module interfaces multiple user ports (p0-p5) and AXI interfaces (s0-s5) with external DDR memory.
 * It manages memory operations, arbitration, and timing through:
 * - Multiple port interfaces for commands, writes, and reads
 * - AXI slave interfaces for high-performance memory access
 * - Configurable parameters for different memory types and timings
 * - Internal calibration and status reporting
 * The module uses a complex state machine to handle memory operations and ensure proper timing and sequencing.
