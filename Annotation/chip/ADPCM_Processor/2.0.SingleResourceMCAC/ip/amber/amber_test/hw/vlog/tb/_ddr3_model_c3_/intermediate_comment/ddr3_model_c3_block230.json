    "block_comment": "This function computes the write Return-to-Turnaround (RTT_WR) value. It accepts two input bits (`rtt[0]` and `rtt[1]`) that represent the RTT mode, which are used to adjust the output impedance of the DDR memory. The function then calculates the RTT_WR by dividing a constant resistance (RZQ) by an integer formed by concatenating `rtt[0]`, `rtt[1]`, and a constant bit (`1'b0`)."
