    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a task named `warmreg` that writes the name of a register to a file. It takes a 4-bit input `regnum` which specifies the register number. If `regnum` is less than 12, the register is simply denoted by its number. However, if `regnum` equals 12, 13, 14, or 15, it corresponds to specific registers `ip`, `sp`, `lr`, or `pc`, respectively, and these shorthand register identifiers are written to the file. The block implements this by using a conditional `if` statement for `regnum` less than 12 and a `case` statement for the remaining register numbers."
