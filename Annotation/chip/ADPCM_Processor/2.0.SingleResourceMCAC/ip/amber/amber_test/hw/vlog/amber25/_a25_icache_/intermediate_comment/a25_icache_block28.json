    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a resettable, clock-edge triggered register with some conditional update. When a positive edge of the `reset` signal is detected, the register `valid_bits_r` is reset to zero. On the positive edge of the `clk` signal, if the current state `c_state` is `CS_IDLE`, then the `valid_bits_r` register is loaded with the most significant bits (at index `TAG_WIDTH-1`) of `tag_rdata_way[0]` and `tag_rdata_way[1]`. The `valid_bits_r` varies as per the state and control signals, thus aiding in control flow based on operational states of the system.\n"
