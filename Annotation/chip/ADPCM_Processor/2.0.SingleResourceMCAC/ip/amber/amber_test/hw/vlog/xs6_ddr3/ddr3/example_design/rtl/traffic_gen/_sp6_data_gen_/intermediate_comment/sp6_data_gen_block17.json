    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for setting different predefined hexadecimal values in the variables SHIFTB_0 through SHIFTB_7 under three distinct conditions. The condition selection depends on the incoming `data_mode_i`. If the incoming `data_mode_i` matches '3b101', a particular set of predefined hexadecimal values is assigned to the SHIFTB array, similarly for '3b100' a different set of values is assigned. For all other values of `data_mode_i`, a third set of hexadecimal values is assigned. Hence, this block functions as a conditional hexadecimal value assigner based on the `data_mode_i` input."
