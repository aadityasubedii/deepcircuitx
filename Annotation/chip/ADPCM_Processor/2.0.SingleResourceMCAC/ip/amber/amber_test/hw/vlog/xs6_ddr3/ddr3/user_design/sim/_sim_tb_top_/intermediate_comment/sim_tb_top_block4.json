    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is performing an assignment operation. The `assign` keyword indicates a continuous assignment that propagates the value of `c3_calib_done` to `calib_done`. Thus, `calib_done` will continuously mirror the state of `c3_calib_done`, implying that `calib_done` is defined as a wire in RTL. The direct assignment indicates that the operation is hardware concurrent and doesn't need any clocking signal. This code segment is likely part of a larger module where `calib_done` and `c3_calib_done` play significant roles."
