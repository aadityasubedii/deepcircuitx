    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is a conditional assignment for the `data_wdata` signal. If a write hit occurs (`write_hit` is high) and the control state (`c_state`) is idle (`CS_IDLE`), `data_wdata` is assigned the value of `write_hit_wdata`; otherwise, `data_wdata` gets the value of `read_miss_wdata`. The purpose of this line is to determine what data gets written to memory during a cache operation based on the cache state and hit/miss results."
