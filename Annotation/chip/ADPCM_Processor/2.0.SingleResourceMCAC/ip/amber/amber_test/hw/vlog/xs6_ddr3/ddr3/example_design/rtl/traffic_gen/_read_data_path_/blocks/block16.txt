Comment: 
This block of Verilog code primarily focuses on data error detection in digital signal processing. Following the raising edge of the clock signal, it compares a received data packet with a reference, divided into lower and upper halves; flags are then set accordingly for any discrepancy. The flags for error in the lower and upper halves of the data (`l_data_error` & `u_data_error`) are decoupled to allow investigation of the specific source of error. The compilation has a delay of `#TCQ`. In the event an error is detected (`data_error` is true), an error message with the expected and received data, and the time of occurrence, is displayed.
