Module-level comment: The 'eth_clockgen' module generates the Management Data Clock (Mdc) for Ethernet applications. It takes clock, reset, and divider signals as inputs and produces Mdc along with its enable(MdcEn) and inverse enable (MdcEn_n) signals. It utilizes an internal counter that counts down and resets based on the reset input or when it reaches zero. The Mdc toggles with the counter reaching zero, and MdcEn, MdcEn_n signals are set accordingly. The clock frequency is adjustably divided using the divider input.
