Comment: 
This block of code manages the synchronous reset operation of an interrupt request signal (`ResetRxCIrq_sync1`) in a receiving interface. The operation is triggered at the rising edge of either the receiver clock (`RxClk`) or the reset signal (`Reset`). When the `Reset` signal is asserted, `ResetRxCIrq_sync1` is explicitly set to `0`, indicating a reset condition. On the other hand, when the `Reset` signal is not active, `ResetRxCIrq_sync1` is assigned the value of `SetRxCIrq_sync2`, which indicates the presence of new incoming data, hence used to control data flow. This effective management ensures smooth data reception even in the event of system reset.
