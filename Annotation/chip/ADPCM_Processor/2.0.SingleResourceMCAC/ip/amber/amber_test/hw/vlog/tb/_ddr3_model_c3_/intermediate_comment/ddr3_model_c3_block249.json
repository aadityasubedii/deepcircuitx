    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for initializing file I/O operations, particularly with regard to opening bank files. If there is no specified model_data path through the +model_data option, the block defaults to the /tmp directory, issuing a warning about this. After setting the model data directory, the block opens files associated with each bank in a loop, utilizing the predefined `BANKS constant to iterate through all available banks. Each bank file is opened by calling the open_bank_file function and storing the file descriptor in the respective slot of the memfd array.\n"
