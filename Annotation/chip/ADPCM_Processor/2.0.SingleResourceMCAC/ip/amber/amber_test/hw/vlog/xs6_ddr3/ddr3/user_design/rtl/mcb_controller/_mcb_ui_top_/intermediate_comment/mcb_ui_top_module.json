    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) supporting multiple ports and AXI interfaces. It manages clock signals, arbitrates between ports, and converts AXI to MCB protocols. The module uses configurable parameters for memory type, port configuration, and arbitration schemes. It instantiates a raw MCB wrapper and optionally AXI interfaces for each port, handling data flow between AXI and MCB domains through internal signals and control logic."
