This block of code executes a timing check procedure, specifically, the cmd_addr_timing_check(18), whenever the 12th bit of the addr_in signal changes. This procedure call helps to ensure timing and synchronization modelling or verification within the system. To achieve this, the Verilog 'always' construct is used, which allows the embedded procedure, cmd_addr_timing_check(18), to respond to any changes in the specified signal, addr_in[11].
