    "block_comment": "The block manages a Delayed Cyclic Redundancy Check Counter (DlyCrcCnt) in a telecommunication data transmission system. At each positive edge of transmitter clock (MTxClk) or on a system reset (Reset), if Reset is high, the counter is initialised to zero. Else, several conditions are evaluated to manage the count: it is reset if the second bit of the data state (StateData[1]) and the counter are both 4 or if 'StartJam' or a previous packet finishes. If the Delayed CRC is enabled (DlyCrcEn) and is in State Start of Frame Delimiter (StateSFD) or the second bit of the data state is true and any of the counter bits are true, the counter increments by one."
