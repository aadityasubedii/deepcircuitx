This block of code is primarily responsible for converting the binary state values to comprehensible ASCII state names for monitoring or debugging purposes. It leverages a Verilog "case" statement within an "always" block that gets triggered on any change in the "state" variable. Depending on the state's value, the "state_ascii" string is updated accordingly to represent the current state of the system using human-understandable terminology. This helps in state tracking and system behavior understanding.
