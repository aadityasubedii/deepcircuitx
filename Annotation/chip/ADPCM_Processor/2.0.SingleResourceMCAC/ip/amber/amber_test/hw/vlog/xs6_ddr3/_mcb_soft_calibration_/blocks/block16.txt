Comment: 
This block controls the memory address of I/O data register and writes the initial delay of Data Quasi-Strobe (DQS) into it. The write mode is set for 'IODRPCTRLR_R_WB' and the address for the memory cell is assigned from 'NegEdgeInDly'. The written data comes from 'DQS_DELAY_INITIAL'. Simultaneously, the 'MCB_UIADDR' is assigned 'IOI_LDQS_CLK' value and 'MCB_CMD_VALID' is set to '1' indicating that the command is valid. If the memory controller buffer (MCB) is ready, not busy ('MCB_RDY_BUSY_N'), the state machine transitions to the 'LDQS_WRITE_NEG_INDELAY' state, else it transitions to 'LDQS_WAIT2' state.
