Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles interrupt generation based on transmission errors in a Write-back (WB) system. At every positive edge of the WB_CLK_I signal or upon system reset, the code sets the transmission error interrupt (TxE_IRQ) signal in synchronous way following certain conditions. If the system is reset, it clears the TxE_IRQ immediately. Alternatively, when both a status write and interrupt enable signals are present (TxStatusWrite & TxIRQEn), it sets TxE_IRQ signal equivalent to the transmission error signal (TxError). In every other case, the TxE_IRQ signal is cleared.
