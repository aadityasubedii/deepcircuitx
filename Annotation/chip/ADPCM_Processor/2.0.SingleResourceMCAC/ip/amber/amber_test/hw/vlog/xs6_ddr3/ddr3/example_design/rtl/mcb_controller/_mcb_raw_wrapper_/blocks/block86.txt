This block manages the state of the `normal_operation_window` signal in response to system resets and self- refresh modes. The 'normal_operation_window' signal is set high during a system reset as per the positive edge of `ui_clk` clock signal. If the system is entering or is already in self-refresh mode, the signal goes low. If it's not standing by for self-refresh but isn't in self-refresh mode either, the signal is again set high. If none of the conditions are met, the signal's status remains unchanged.
