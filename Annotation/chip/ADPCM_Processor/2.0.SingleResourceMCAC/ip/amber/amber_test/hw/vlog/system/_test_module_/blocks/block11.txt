Comment: 
The given block of code assigns output interrupt request signals based on timer conditions. Specifically, it uses the `assign` keyword to continuously drive the output interrupt request (`o_irq`) and fast interrupt request (`o_firq`) signals. These assignments are based on equality checks with the value 1 (`8'd1`), thus the `o_irq` signal is activated when `irq_timer` equals 1 and similarly, the `o_firq` signal is activated when `firq_timer` equals to 1.
