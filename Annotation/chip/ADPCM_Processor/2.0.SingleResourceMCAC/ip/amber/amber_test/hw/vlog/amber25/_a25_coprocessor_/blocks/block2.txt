Comment: 
This block operates as a synchronous circuit that responds to the positive edges of the reset or clock signal. It populates values of 'copro_operation_d1' and 'copro_crn_d1'. On reset, it initializes the 'copro_operation_d1' and 'copro_crn_d1' to zero. On positive edge of the clock signal, if the 'i_core_stall' is not asserted, it assigns input-variable values 'i_copro_operation' and 'i_copro_crn' to 'copro_operation_d1' and 'copro_crn_d1' respectively.
