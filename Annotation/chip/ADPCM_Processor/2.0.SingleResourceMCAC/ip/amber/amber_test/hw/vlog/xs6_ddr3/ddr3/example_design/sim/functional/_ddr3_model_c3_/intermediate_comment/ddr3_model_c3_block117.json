    "block_comment": "This block is a procedural block designed to initiate a subroutine named `dq_timing_check` when the 14th index (using 0-based index) value in the `dq_in` vector changes. This procedure is implemented in an `always` block, indicating that it is continually monitored for any change in `dq_in[13]`. When a change in `dq_in[13]` occurs, the `dq_timing_check` procedure is executed with the argument `13`. This allows the `dq_timing_check` procedure to perform a timing verification for this specific index of the `dq_in` vector."
