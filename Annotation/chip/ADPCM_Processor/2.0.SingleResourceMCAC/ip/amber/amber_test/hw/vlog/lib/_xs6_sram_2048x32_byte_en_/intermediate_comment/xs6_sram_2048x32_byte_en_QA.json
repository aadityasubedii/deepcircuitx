It consists of four 2048x8-bit SRAM blocks (RAMB16BWER) to create a 32-bit wide memory. The module supports byte-level write operations through the byte enable input, allowing selective writing of individual bytes within a 32-bit word. The memory can be initialized with predefined values using parameters. It provides a synchronous read/write interface with a clock input, address bus, data input/output, write enable, and byte enable signals."
