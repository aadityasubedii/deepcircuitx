    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is essentially for dynamically selecting the type of I/O Buffer (IOBUF) based on the memory type configuration. If the memory type (C_MEM_TYPE) is DDR, MDDR or DDR2 without Differential DQS Enabled (C_MEM_DDR2_DIFF_DQS_EN == \"NO\"), a standard I/O Buffer (IOBUF) is used, otherwise a Differential I/O Buffer (IOBUFDS) is used. The IOBUF or IOBUFDS is configured with inputs/outputs such as `.I(ioi_dqs)`,`.T(t_dqs)`,`.O(in_pre_dqsp)`. Differential version also has an additional inverted output `.IOB(mcbx_dram_dqs_n)`."
