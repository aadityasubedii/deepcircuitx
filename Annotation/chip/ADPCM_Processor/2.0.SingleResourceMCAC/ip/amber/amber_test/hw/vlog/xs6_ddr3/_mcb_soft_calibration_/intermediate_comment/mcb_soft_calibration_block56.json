    "block_comment": "The block defines the operations performed at the START state in a state machine. The signals MCB_UICMDEN, MCB_UIDONECAL, P_Term, N_Term, Pre_SYSRST, LastPass_DynCal are set to specific values to initialize or prepare for subsequent operations. If the SKIP_IN_TERM_CAL condition is true, the STATE is immediately changed to WAIT_FOR_START_BROADCAST with P_Term, N_Term reset. Otherwise, if IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N is true, the STATE is set to LOAD_RZQ_NTERM. If both conditions are false, the STATE stays at START."
