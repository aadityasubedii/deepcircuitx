    "block_comment": "This block of code represents instantiation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog. The instantiation is done using an instance of the module \"a23_alu\" named \"u_alu\". The inputs to the ALU include two operands (\"rn\", \"barrel_shift_out\"), a carry from a barrel shifter (\"barrel_shift_carry_alu\"), a status bit for carry (\"status_bits_flags[1]\"), and an ALU function (\"i_alu_function\"). The outputs of the ALU are the result of the computation (\"alu_out\") and flags for condition checking (\"alu_flags\")."
