    "block_comment": "This block of code acts as an error checking mechanism in a Verilog design. It observes the state of the 'C_PORT_CONFIG', 'p4_cmd_en' and specific bits of 'p4_cmd_instr'. If the check condition is met (which signifies an invalid command for a write-only port), an error message is displayed, and the simulation execution is ceased via the $finish command.\n"
