Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a part of the receiver logic which functions to manage ending signal for a shift operation. On a rising edge of MRxClk or Reset, it checks for certain conditions and sets the 'ShiftEnded_rck' signal. If the system is being reset, it clears 'ShiftEnded_rck' by setting it to 0. If the receiver isn't being aborted, permits data writing to RX FIFO, and if start shift signal indicates the end of shift operation, it sets 'ShiftEnded_rck' to 1. Alternatively, it clears 'ShiftEnded_rck' if the receiver is being aborted, or when synchronization signals ('ShiftEndedSync_c1' and 'ShiftEndedSync_c2') are true.
