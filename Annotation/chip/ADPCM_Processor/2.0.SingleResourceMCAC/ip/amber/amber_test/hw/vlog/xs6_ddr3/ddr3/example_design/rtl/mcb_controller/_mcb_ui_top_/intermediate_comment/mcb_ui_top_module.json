It manages memory access requests, performs \narbitration, and handles command and data operations. The module integrates AXI \ninterfaces with the MCB, supports various memory types and configurations, and \nincludes calibration features. It uses internal signals to connect AXI interfaces \nto the MCB and generates appropriate control signals for memory operations.\n*/"
