Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is used for generating system reset signal `c3_sys_rst_i`. The functionality is determined by the `C3_RST_ACT_LOW` condition. If `C3_RST_ACT_LOW` is true, the system reset signal `c3_sys_rst_i` is simply assigned the same logic level as `c3_sys_rst`. If it's false, `c3_sys_rst_i` is assigned the inverted value of `c3_sys_rst`. This provides flexibility in systems where the active state of the reset signal might be high or low.
