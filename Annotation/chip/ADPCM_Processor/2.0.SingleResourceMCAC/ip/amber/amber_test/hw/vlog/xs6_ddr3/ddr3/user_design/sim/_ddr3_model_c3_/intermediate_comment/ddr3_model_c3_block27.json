    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a timing check procedure for the digital quarternary system (DQS) signal. It achieves this through an always block that's triggered at the falling edge (negative edge) of the 5th element of the dqs_in array - indicating a focus on the particular timing of this element. This triggers the function `dqs_neg_timing_check(5)` dedicated to check the timing properties related to the negative-edge instances of this specific signal line."
