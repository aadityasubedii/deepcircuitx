    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for generating and assigning specific data based on the given address and data mode. On every positive edge of the input clock signal, if the fifo (first in, first out) system is ready or the command start signal is high, and the select for word1 generator logic signal is high, then depending on the 3 bits (encoded from 0 to 7) of the input address, different data is generated using either the Data_Gen or Data_GenW0 function and is assigned to word1 data. The specific data function that is called and data that is produced is further dependent on the state of the data mode signal."
