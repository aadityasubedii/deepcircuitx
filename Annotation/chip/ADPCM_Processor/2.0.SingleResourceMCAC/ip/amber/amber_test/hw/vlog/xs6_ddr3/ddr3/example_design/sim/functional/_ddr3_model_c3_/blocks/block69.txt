This block triggers a function called dq_timing_check with argument 61 whenever there is a change in the 61st bit of the dq_in array. Specifically, using the `always @` construct, the block listens for any change (a rise or fall in signal level) on the specific bit of the dq_in array. When an event occurs, it calls the dq_timing_check function passing in 61 as an argument, likely for programmatically adjusting timing checks associated with this bit in a digital circuit.
