    "module": "Module-level comment: The eth_transmitcontrol module manages ethernet data transmission including start, control, and abort of data frames. It uses multiple input/output ports and internal signals for real-time data processing. Use of Tx signals, MAC address, and CRC delay counters optimizes transmission integrity and flow. The module performs a range of functions including data synchronization, reset, multiplexing data, controlling CRC delay, and handling byte count. The robust design efficiently drives the ethernet communication protocol."
