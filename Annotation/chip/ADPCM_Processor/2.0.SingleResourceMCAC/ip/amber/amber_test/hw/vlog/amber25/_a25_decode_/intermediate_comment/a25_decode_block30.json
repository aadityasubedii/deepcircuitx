    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code calculates the sum of the bits in an instruction, storing the result in 'mtrans_num_registers'. The block achieves this by taking each individual bit from the instruction (bits [0:15]) and adding them together. The 4\u2019d0 on the left side of each summand ensures the single bit instruction is translated to a wider format before addition to maintain bit-width consistency."
