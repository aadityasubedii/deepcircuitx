    "block_comment": "This block is a data generator based on the input address and data mode. During a positive edge of the clock, it checks if fifo_rdy_i is high or cmd_startC is high and if w1data generation should be done. It uses a case statement to divide the address lines into different categories for data generation depending on the addr_i value. If data_mode_i is 0101, it calls the Data_Gen function with the corresponding case number, otherwise, it calls the Data_GenW0 function. Additionally, if MEM_BURST_LEN is 8, it shifts the generated data bits to packing four data units side by side."
