This line of code is performing a continuous assignment in Verilog. The purpose of this block, specifically, is to assign the value of the `wdp_validB` to the output register `wdp_validB_o`. With the use of 'assign' keyword, the variable `wdp_validB_o` is continuously updated whenever the value of `wdp_validB` changes, making it essentially a wire that mirrors the value on `wdp_validB`.
