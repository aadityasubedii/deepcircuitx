    "block_comment": "This block of code launches a timing check whenever there's a falling edge on the 10th bit of the dqs_in signal. This is performed using the built-in 'always' construction, and the operation is initiated on the falling (negative) edge of the dqs_in bus, specifically for the 10th bit. The function dqs_neg_timing_check is subsequently called with '9' as the parameter, which likely refers to the aforementioned 10th bit based on zero-indexing."
