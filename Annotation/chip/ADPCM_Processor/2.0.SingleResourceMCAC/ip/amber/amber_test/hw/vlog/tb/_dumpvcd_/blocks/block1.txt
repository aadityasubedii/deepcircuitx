Comment: 
The code block controls the testing debug data capture according to clock tick counts. As the clock signal 'U_DECOMPILE.i_clk' rises, the block checks for certain conditions to either turn on or off the data dump function `$dumpon` or `$dumpoff`. It triggers according to different clock count conditions such as it reaches 10, 20, or (`AMBER_DUMP_START + 0`), and (`AMBER_DUMP_START + AMBER_DUMP_LENGTH`). Each trigger also outputs a display message marking the time. If a defined `AMBER_TERMINATE` is present, it will display a termination message and throw an error when the clock count hits (`AMBER_DUMP_START + AMBER_DUMP_LENGTH + 100`).
