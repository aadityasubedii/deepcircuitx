    "block_comment": "The given block of code is involved in the process of controlling latching of CRC errors in a Receiver module. The always block is triggered at the positive edge of MRxClk or Reset signal. When a Reset signal or RxStateSFD is detected, LatchedCrcError is set to 0 implying no detected error. However, if RxStateData[0] is true (which indicates the reception of data), LatchedCrcError is set to the result of a bitwise operation between RxCrcError and the not-operation of RxByteCntEq0, indicating potential error detection."
