    "block_comment": "This is a procedural block in Verilog that gets invoked whenever there's a change in the input signal 'cas_n_in'. This particular block invokes a function 'cmd_addr_timing_check' with the constant argument '2'. The purpose of this block is to perform a command address timing check whenever the 'cas_n_in' gets updated. The operation is implemented using an 'always' block, which listens for changes in the signal 'cas_n_in'. Upon such change, the function 'cmd_addr_timing_check' is called with the timing value set to '2'."
