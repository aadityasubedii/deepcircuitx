    "block_comment": "This block is used for triggering different commands based on the validity and readiness of the respective commands. Upon every positive edge of the clock signal (clk_i), using delay modelled by '#TCQ', it assigns to each cmd_startX logical AND of cmd_validX_i and cmd_rdyX. This signifies that a specific command can only start if it is not only valid but also ready to be started."
