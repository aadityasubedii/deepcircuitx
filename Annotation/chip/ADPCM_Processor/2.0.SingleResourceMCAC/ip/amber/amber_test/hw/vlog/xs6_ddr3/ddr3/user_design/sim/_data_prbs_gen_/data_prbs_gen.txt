Module-level comment: The data_prbs_gen module generates a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) using a configurable linear feedback shift register (LFSR). It operates based on clock, clock enable, and reset input signals. Seed inputs allow for dynamic reseeding of LFSR. The LFSR operates only when clock enable is active, and generates a PRBS sequence stored in a register and output. The module includes two always blocks: one handles the LFSR update and another manages the propagation of current PRBS. The module's operation is parameterized for configurable delay and PRBS width.
