This block of code configures a specific data generation pattern in a 24-pin memory system. The configuration is conditional, with the number of Data Query (DQ) pins set to 24 and the Data Pattern controlled by a predefined set of string comparisons, i.e., "DGEN_WALKING1", "DGEN_WALKING0", "DGEN_NEIGHBOR", and "DGEN_ALL". Depending on the conditions met, the code segment labelled as "WALKING_ONE_24_PATTERN" will execute.
