    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the assignment of values to mig_p2 components and p2_cmd components based on the status of the 'C_PORT_ENABLE[2]'. If C_PORT_ENABLE[2] is high, various 'mig_p2_cmd' variables and 'p2_cmd' variables are assigned values corresponding to their related 'p2_cmd' variables and 'mig_p2_cmd' variables respectively. The block length (mig_p2_cmd_bl) specifically performs an OR operation with the third bit of 'p2_cmd_instr' and the sixth bit of 'p2_cmd_bl'. All other assignments are direct. If the C_PORT_ENABLE[2] is not set, all these variables are assigned to a bit of 0."
