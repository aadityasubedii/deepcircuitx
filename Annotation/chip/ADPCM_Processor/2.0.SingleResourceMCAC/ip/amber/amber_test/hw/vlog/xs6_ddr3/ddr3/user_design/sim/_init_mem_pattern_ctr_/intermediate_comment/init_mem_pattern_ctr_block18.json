    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for assigning a value to the wire `FIXED_BL_VALUE` based on the FPGA family type and the memory burst length. If the FPGA family is \"VIRTEX6\" and the memory burst length is 0 or 8, then the fixed burst length becomes 2. However, if the FPGA family type is \"VIRTEX6\" and the memory burst length is 4, then the fixed burst length is assigned a value of 1. For all other configurations, the fixed burst length is assigned the predefined value `FIXEDBL`. This is implemented using multiple conditional ternary operators."
