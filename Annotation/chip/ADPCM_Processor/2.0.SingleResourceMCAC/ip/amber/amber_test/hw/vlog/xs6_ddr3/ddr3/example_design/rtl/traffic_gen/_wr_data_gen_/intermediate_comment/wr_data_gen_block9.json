    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a 'ready' command signal (cmd_rdyB) based on certain conditions. The command is set to 'ready' whenever a reset signal is high, or a start signal is received and the block length is 1. Additionally, it sets 'ready' when user burst count equals 2 and the FIFO buffer is not full. This is implemented using an always block in Verilog, which is triggered at every positive clock edge. It employs conditional statements to check for the required conditions and accordingly sets the 'ready' command."
