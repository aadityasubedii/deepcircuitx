Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) that interfaces with external DDR/DDR2/DDR3 memory. It handles low-level I/O operations, including data read/write, address management, and command signals. The module supports multiple port configurations, different memory types, and various data widths. Input ports include clock signals, control signals, command interfaces, and data for read/write operations across multiple ports. Output ports provide status information, memory interface signals, and data read from memory. Internal signals are used for reset control, clock management, calibration processes, and self-refresh operations. The module incorporates IOB instantiation for address, bank address, and control signals, IODRP2 components for DQ and DQS signals, and OSERDES2 for data serialization. It includes logic for clock generation, reset handling
