Comment: 
The block of code assigns a string value to the variable `xSOURCE_SEL` based on the status of various source select signals. It performs this assignment within a priority-based secession using a multi-line conditional (ternary) operator, which assigns `xSOURCE_SEL` with the first string whose corresponding source selection signal is true. If none of the signals is true, "UNKNOWN" is assigned.
