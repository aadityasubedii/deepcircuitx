    "block_comment": "The block runs a reset and synchronization operation for the receiver status write latched signal. During a reset or at the rising edge of the wishbone clock, the signal `RxStatusWriteLatched_syncb1` and `RxStatusWriteLatched_syncb2` are both set to 0. However, under normal operation or when reset is not asserted, a delay mechanism (`#Tp`) is employed to synchronize the states of `RxStatusWriteLatched_syncb1` and `RxStatusWriteLatched_syncb2` with succeeding and preceding signals respectively for coordination of actions."
