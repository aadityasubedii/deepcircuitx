    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns a constant value to a wire or reg variable. More specifically, the wire or reg 'o_wb_err' is assigned the constant value of 1'b0, a binary single bit of zero. This is a straightforward assignment, usually used for initialization or to create a constant signal in Verilog RTL code."
