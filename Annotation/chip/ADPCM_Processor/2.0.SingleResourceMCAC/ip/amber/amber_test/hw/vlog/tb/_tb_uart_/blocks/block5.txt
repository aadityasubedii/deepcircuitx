This block of code is a resettable flip-flop. It governs the behavior of the register `tx_push_r`, sensitive to the rising edge of `clk_uart` or the falling edge of `clk_uart_rst_n`. Specifically, in the presence of a negative `clk_uart_rst_n` (reset active low), the `tx_push_r` register is reset to a default value of decimal 0. Otherwise, the value of `tx_push` is loaded into the register `tx_push_r` on the rising edge of `clk_uart`.
