    "block_comment": "This block initiates a timing check function whenever a positive edge (transition from low to high) is detected in the dqs_in signal at the 4th index, which implies that it is associated with dynamic timing analysis. This is implemented through an \"always @\" block, which in Verilog RTL, is a sensitive block triggered whenever the condition within the brackets met. Here, the condition is the rising edge of the dqs_in signal's 4th bit. Hence, whenever dqs_in[4] has a positive edge, the function \"dqs_pos_timing_check\" with the input argument of 4, gets executed."
