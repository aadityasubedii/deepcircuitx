Module-level comment: The "infrastructure" module serves as a fundamental clocking setup for a digital system. It uses the 'IBUFGDS' or 'IBUFG' buffers for handling differential or single-ended input clocks respectively, and employs a PLL for target frequency output generation. Key functionalities include base-clock buffering, system reset handling, and primary and phase-delayed clock enable generation. Internal signals and the 'generate' and 'always' blocks in Verilog facilitate these functions.
