Module-level comment: This module performs soft calibration for a Memory Controller Block (MCB), including initialization, termination calibration, and dynamic DQS calibration. It uses a state machine to control the calibration process, adjusting termination resistances and DQS delays. The module interfaces with IODRP controllers, handles self-refresh requests, and implements dynamic calibration algorithms to optimize signal integrity. It progresses through multiple stages, including RZQ/ZIO calibration, DQS delay adjustment, and continuous monitoring of performance metrics to maintain optimal calibration.
