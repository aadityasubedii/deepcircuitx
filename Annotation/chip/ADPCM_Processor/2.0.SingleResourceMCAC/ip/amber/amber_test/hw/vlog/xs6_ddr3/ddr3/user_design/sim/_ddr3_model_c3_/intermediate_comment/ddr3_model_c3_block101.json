    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to monitor changes in the 30th bit of the 'dq_in' signal and invoke the 'dq_timing_check' procedure whenever any change occurs. This block uses an 'always @' statement in Verilog to watch the specified bit continuously. On change detected, it implements a call to 'dq_timing_check' procedure with the argument '29', noting that the indices in Verilog are zero-based, referring to the 30th bit.\n"
