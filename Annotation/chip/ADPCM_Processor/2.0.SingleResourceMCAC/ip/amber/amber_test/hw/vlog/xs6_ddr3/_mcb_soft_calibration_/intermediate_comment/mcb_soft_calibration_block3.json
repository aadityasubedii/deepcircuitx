    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a state in a state machine labeled as 'DONE'. It carries out a post computation operation where it resets the Pre_SYSRST and MCB_UICMDEN signals to 0, indicating the end of a particular operation. Then it sets the current state to 'DONE'. This is typically used in synchronous designs where operations need to be disabled and the system reset after certain operations are completed."
