Module-level comment:
This module, named 'interrupt_controller', manages and controls main interrupts (IRQs), fast interrupt requests (FIRQs), and communicates with the Wishbone bus. It executes these operations via multiple input/output ports and internal signals. The module processes interrupt inputs from UART modules, Ethernet MAC module, timer modules, software interrupt registers, and selectively uses enabling registers to filter the final interrupts. Furthermore, the module handles read and write operations with Wishbone bus and generates debugging information. Higher level cases are defined based on data width which dictates how the data is divided before processing.
