    "block_comment": "The block of code functions as a control logic block for transmitting frames. It orchestrates operations based on the condition of the Reset line, the TxStartFrm_sync2 signal, and complex conditions related to data usage and transmission statuses. When the Reset line goes high, the transmission starts from the frame is set to false (0). If the TxStartFrm_sync2 signal goes high, the transmission starts from the frame is set to true (1). If the frame is being used or TxRetry or TxAbort signals are activated without their previous states, the transmission starts from the frame is set to false (0). These changes are explicitly activated at the rising edge of MTxClk or Reset."
