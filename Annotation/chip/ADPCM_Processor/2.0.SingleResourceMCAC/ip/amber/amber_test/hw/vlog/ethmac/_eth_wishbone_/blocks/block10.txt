Comment: 
This block updates two registers, RxStatusWriteLatched_sync1 and RxStatusWriteLatched_sync2, based on either a positive edge clock signal or a reset signal. The registers are reset when a Reset signal is received. In absence of a Reset, the registers get updated synchronously with the input RxStatusWriteLatched and its intermediate first stage ripple carry RxStatusWriteLatched_sync1, providing two-stage synchronization to avoid potential metastability issues.
