    "block_comment": "The given block of code regulates the updating of registers in a memory cell system on a positive clock cycle. At each positive cycle of the DRP_CLK, it checks if its state is in the READY condition. If it's true, the memory cell address, write_data and rd_not_write values get stored in 'memcell_addr_reg', 'data_reg' and 'rd_not_write_reg' registers, respectively."
