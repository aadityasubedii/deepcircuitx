    "block_comment": "This block of code is for synchronizing the 'mcb_init_done_i' signal with respect to the rising edge of the 'clk_i' clock signal. In every rising edge of the clock, the value of 'mcb_init_done_i' is stored first in 'mcb_init_done_reg1' and then it is transferred to another register 'mcb_init_done_reg'. This two-level storage mechanism ensures the signal is properly synchronized to the clock, reducing the effect of metastability.\n"
