    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a synchronous reset and update of the variable 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync2'. It consistently checks for a rising edge of the 'MTxClk' or 'Reset' signal using the 'always' function. If the 'Reset' signal is high, it immediately flushes 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync2' to binary 0, otherwise, it loads the state from 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync1'."
