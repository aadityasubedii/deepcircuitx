    "block_comment": "This block is a broadcast process term state in a finite state machine (FSM) for the operations of a memory cell. It sets up the address, write data, write mode, command signal, and other parameters for memory operations. It particularly uses inverse logic of whether it's the first term done to update the DRP, and utilizes a backup store. The block transitions into the same state if the memory cell bus resource (MCB) is ready, else it goes to the WAIT5 state for the FSM to get another chance to access the resources."
