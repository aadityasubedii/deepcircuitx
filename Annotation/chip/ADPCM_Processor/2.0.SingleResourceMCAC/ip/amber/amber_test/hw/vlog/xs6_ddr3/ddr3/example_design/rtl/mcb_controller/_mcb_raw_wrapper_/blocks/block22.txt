This block of code configures an OSERDES2 block, which is a Serializer/Deserializer that facilitates high-speed data transmission by serializing the input. Here, it is set up with a bypass flip-flop, predetermined output modes, and data rates. It has a fixed data width of 2. The internal system reset (int_sys_rst) and pll_ce_0 from a PLL block drive the reset and clock enable respectively. The inputs we_90 are fed into D1 and D2 while other D and T inputs are held at 0. The output is taken from OQ (ioi_we) and TQ (t_we). No shiftin functionality is used in this configuration considering SHIFTIN inputs are set to 0. The CLK0 is driven by ioclk0, and the other clocking inputs are held at a constant 0.
