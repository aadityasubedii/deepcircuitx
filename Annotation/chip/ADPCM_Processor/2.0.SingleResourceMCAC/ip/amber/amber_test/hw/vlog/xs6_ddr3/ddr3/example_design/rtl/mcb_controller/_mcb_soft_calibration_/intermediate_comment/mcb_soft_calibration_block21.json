    "block_comment": "This block performs initial calibration in dynamic calibration mode and assigns initial state and signals. It disables the UICMDEN signal, denotes completion of calibration by setting UIDONECAL to 1, and sends a calibration pre-system reset by setting Pre_SYSRST. Based on calibration mode (CALMODE_EQ_CALIBRATION) and pre_sysrst_minpulse_width_ok condition, it either goes to the START_DYN_CAL state or waits for UODONE signal in the WAIT_FOR_UODONE state."
