    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is designed to generate a clock signal with a frequency of 25 MHz. The code accomplishes this by toggling the signal `clk_25mhz` every 20,000 time units. The `forever` loop helps to continually flip the state of the clock signal `clk_25mhz` at the defined interval. This simulation construct is typically used in a testbench to generate a clock signal for the Device Under Test (DUT)."
