    "spec": "Module name: \"infrastructure\".\nModule specification: The 'infrastructure' module is a critical part of a system that manages the clock and reset infrastructure of a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design. It employs various parameters to manage, divide, and condition the clocks. This module retrieves inputs like different system clocks and a system reset signal. It generates numerous output clock signals, reset signals, clock signals, phase-locked-loop controls, and others, under different input signal conditions. The \"infrastructure\" module includes several input ports, including sys_clk_p, sys_clk_n, sys_clk, and sys_rst_i, responsible for the timing control and synchronization of the RTL infrastructure. In return, it generates output ports like clk0, rst0, async_rst, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, and pll_lock, which manage timing, resets, and provide indicators for locking status of system inputs. It uses several internal signals, such as RST_SYNC_NUM, CLK_PERIOD_NS, clk_2x_0, and powerup_pll_locked, for different purpose like managing stable reset signal propagation, managing clock period, doubling the frequency, and indicating pll locked status during the power-up. The design contains several blocks such as a differential and single-ended input clock section, a Phase Locked Loop (PLL), and a BUFPLL_MCB, which is used to manage the frequency multiply, divide, or phase shift the clock signals in the design. The module also includes an asynchronous reset generation, synchronizing the reset signal with output clock, and generating reset output. Therefore, this 'infrastructure' module is a comprehensive interface responsible for managing and maintaining RTL design's timing and signal functions.",

                    "text": "Module name: \"infrastructure\".\nModule specification: The 'infrastructure' module is a critical part of a system that manages the clock and reset infrastructure of a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design. It employs various parameters to manage, divide, and condition the clocks. This module retrieves inputs like different system clocks and a system reset signal. It generates numerous output clock signals, reset signals, clock signals, phase-locked-loop controls, and others, under different input signal conditions. The \"infrastructure\" module includes several input ports, including sys_clk_p, sys_clk_n, sys_clk, and sys_rst_i, responsible for the timing control and synchronization of the RTL infrastructure. In return, it generates output ports like clk0, rst0, async_rst, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, and pll_lock, which manage timing, resets, and provide indicators for locking status of system inputs. It uses several internal signals, such as RST_SYNC_NUM, CLK_PERIOD_NS, clk_2x_0, and powerup_pll_locked, for different purpose like managing stable reset signal propagation, managing clock period, doubling the frequency, and indicating pll locked status during the power-up. The design contains several blocks such as a differential and single-ended input clock section, a Phase Locked Loop (PLL), and a BUFPLL_MCB, which is used to manage the frequency multiply, divide, or phase shift the clock signals in the design. The module also includes an asynchronous reset generation, synchronizing the reset signal with output clock, and generating reset output. Therefore, this 'infrastructure' module is a comprehensive interface responsible for managing and maintaining RTL design's timing and signal functions."
