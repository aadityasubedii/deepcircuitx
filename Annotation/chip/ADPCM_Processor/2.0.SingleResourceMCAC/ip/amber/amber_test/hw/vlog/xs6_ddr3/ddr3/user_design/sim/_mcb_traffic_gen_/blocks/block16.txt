The block assigns the output of a memory command buffer (mcb_cmd_addr_o) from the output address (addr_o). It does this by selecting the entire range of the address width (from the most significant bit to the least significant bit [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0]) and ensuring that all bits are represented in this assignment.
