This block of Verilog RTL code defines a write pointer controller for a clocked circuit. On each positive edge of the read clock (rd_clk), if a reset signal (rst) is high, the write pointer (wr_ptr) and gray code (wr_gray) are resets to zero. Otherwise, if the write enable signal (wr_en) is high, the write pointer is incremented by one. Concurrently, the gray code is updated to the next state (wr_gray_nxt) in every clock cycle regardless of the write enable signal. The propagation delay for the register updates is defined by the constant TCQ.
