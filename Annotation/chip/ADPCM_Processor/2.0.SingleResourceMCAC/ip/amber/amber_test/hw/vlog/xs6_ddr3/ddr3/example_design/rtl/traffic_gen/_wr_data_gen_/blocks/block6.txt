Comment: 
This block controls the signal `cmd_rdyE`, which indicates that a command is ready to be executed. It works by monitoring the reset input `rst_i[0]` and the command start signal `cmd_startE`, as well as the state of the FIFO buffer and the user burst count. If `rst_i[0]` is set or `cmd_startE` is active and `bl_i` is 1, or if the user burst count equals 2 and the FIFO buffer is not full, then `cmd_rdyE` is set high (indicating a command is ready), with a delay defined by `TCQ`. Otherwise, `cmd_rdyE` is set low.
