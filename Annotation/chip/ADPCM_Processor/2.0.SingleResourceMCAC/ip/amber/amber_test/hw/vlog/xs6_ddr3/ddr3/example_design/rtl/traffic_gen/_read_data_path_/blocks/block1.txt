[509, 509]
Comment: 
This single line of Verilog code is for error output propagation. It leverages the 'assign' keyword to propagate the value of the 'data_error' wire or reg to the output port 'data_error_o'. Thus, whenever a data error event or condition occurs internally within the module or sub-block, this condition will be reported at the output port 'data_error_o' for the external logic or parent module to act upon.
