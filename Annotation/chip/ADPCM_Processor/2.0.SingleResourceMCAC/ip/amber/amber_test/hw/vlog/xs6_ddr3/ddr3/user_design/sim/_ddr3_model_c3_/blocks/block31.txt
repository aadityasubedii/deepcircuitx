Comment: 
This block of code triggers a specific function when there is a falling edge (negative edge) detected in the second bit (indexed from 0) of the dqs_in bus. This is implemented via an always block in Verilog, which continuously monitors the specified signal conditions, and upon fulfillment of the condition (in this case, a negative edge on 'dqs_in[ 1]') it calls the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check( 1)'.
