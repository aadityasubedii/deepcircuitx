    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for data manipulation and shifting based on certain conditions and the value of the fifo_rdy_i signal, user_burst_cnt, cmd_startC, and NUM_DQ_PINS, with the activities occurring at the positive edge of clk_i or with a reset. On reset, it initializes w1data, ndata_rising, and shift_en. If either fifo_rdy_i is high and user_burst_cnt is not zero or cmd_startC is high, it carries out conditional operations based on NUM_DQ_PINS being 16, 8, or 4 and assigns a new value to w1data. The data manipulation is based on cmd_startC and data_mode_i. If NUM_DQ_PINS has a non-matching value, there is no effect on the output of this block."
