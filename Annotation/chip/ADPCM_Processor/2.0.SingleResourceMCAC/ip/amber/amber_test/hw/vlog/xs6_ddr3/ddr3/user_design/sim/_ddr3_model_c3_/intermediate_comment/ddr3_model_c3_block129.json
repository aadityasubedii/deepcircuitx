    "block_comment": "This block of code monitors the dq_in array's second element (indices start from 0) and triggers the dq_timing_check function whenever the state of dq_in[1] changes. The implementation utilizes an 'always' block in Verilog, which is an event control statement that is triggered when the specified condition in the sensitivity list (dq_in[1] in this case) changes. Whenever the dq_in array's second element transitions (from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0), the function dq_timing_check with parameter '1' is called, maintaining constant vigilance on the input signals."
