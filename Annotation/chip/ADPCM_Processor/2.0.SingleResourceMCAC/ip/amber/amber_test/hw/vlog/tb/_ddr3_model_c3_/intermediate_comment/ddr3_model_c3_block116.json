    "block_comment": "This block of code deals with the monitoring of a particular bit line, specifically the 15th (zero-indexed) line, of a given digital signal (dq_in). It employs an always block that is sensitive only to changes in dq_in[14]. As soon as there's any change in this bit line, the function dq_timing_check with an argument of 14, is executed to verify timing properties of that particular data line."
