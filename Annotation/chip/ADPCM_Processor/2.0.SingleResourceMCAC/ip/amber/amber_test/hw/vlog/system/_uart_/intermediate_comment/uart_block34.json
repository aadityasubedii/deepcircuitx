    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the signal `rx_fifo_pop` in a way that it becomes high if a read operation is initiated (`wb_start_read`) and if the lower 16 bits of the address on the wishbone bus (`i_wb_adr[15:0]`) match the UART data register (`AMBER_UART_DR`). The use of the `assign` keyword and the logical AND operation (`&&`) in Verilog RTL indicate a continuous assignment that continuously drives the `rx_fifo_pop` wire with the evaluated result of the logical expression."
