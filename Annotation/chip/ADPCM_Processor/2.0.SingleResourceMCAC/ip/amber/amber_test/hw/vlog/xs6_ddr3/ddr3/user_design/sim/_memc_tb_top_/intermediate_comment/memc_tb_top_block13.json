    "block_comment": "The code block controls data flow and traffic generation for a specific memory port, provided the memory port enable flag is set. Upon activation, it initializes the memory pattern controller with multiple modes and parameters and links it to signal inputs and outputs. The block also handles traffic generation, conditions for traffic execution and manual error-clearing operations via interaction with the Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface. In case the memory port is not enabled, the associated error, error status, cmp_data, cmp_data_valid, and cmp_error signals are automatically set to zero. Details include conditional generation code for traffic control, memory pattern control and MCB-related operations, and also the usage of parameters for adjusting working modes, addresses, seed values and data bus size."
