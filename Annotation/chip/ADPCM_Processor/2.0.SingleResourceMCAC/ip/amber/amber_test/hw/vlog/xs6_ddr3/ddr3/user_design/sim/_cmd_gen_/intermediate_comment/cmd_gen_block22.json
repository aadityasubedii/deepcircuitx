    "block_comment": "This block of code is meant to calculate and assign the end address range of a memory operation. It captures the value at each positive edge of the input clock. The calculation involves subtracting the product of the data width (DWIDTH, presumably defined elsewhere in the code) divided by eight and the current burst length (bl_out_reg) from the 16 least significant bits of end_addr_i, adding 1 to the result, and storing it into the end_addr_range after a delay specified by the parameter TCQ. This suggests the excerpt is situated in the context of a memory controller module dealing with varied size data transfers."
