    "block_comment": "This code block is a function named `pick_way` in Verilog that serves as a router or selector mechanism based on input `valid_bits` and a `random_num`. It sequentially tests each bit in `valid_bits` from lowest index upwards. If it encounters a zero, it indicates the respective way (in binary representation where each bit stands for a corresponding way) and then exits. However, if all valid_bits are set (all 1s), it executes a case statement based on `random_num[3:1]` (i.e., the higher 3 bits of `random_num`) to arbitrarily select a way. The `pick_way` function is thus designed to auto-route/assign based on `valid_bits` or randomize assignments when all bits are engaged."
