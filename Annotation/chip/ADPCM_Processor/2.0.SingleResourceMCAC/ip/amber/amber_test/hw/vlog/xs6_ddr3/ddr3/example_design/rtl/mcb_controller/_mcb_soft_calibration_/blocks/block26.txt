Comment: 
This block of Verilog code facilitates state transitions in a state machine tailored for memory control. In the `UDQS_PIN_N_TERM_WAIT` state, the code checks for the `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` signal. As long as it remains not activated, the state machine continues to stay in this state. Once `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` signal gets activated, the machine transitions to the `OFF_RZQ_PTERM` state where it sets the `Active_IODRP` value to `RZQ`. Noteworthy, this block is part of a larger state machine, so transitions from other states like `UDQS_PIN_WRITE_N_TERM` are contextual and depend on previous or subsequent states.
