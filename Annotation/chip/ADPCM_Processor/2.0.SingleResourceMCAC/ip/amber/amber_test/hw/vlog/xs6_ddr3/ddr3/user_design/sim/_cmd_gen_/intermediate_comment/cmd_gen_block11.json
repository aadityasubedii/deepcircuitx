    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for assigning a value to the 'refresh_prbs' signal on the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk_i'. How the signal is assigned depends on the value of the FAMILY macro. If FAMILY is set to \"SPARTAN6\", 'refresh_prbs' will be assigned the logical AND of 'prbs_instr_b[3]' and 'refresh_cmd_en' after some delay defined by '#TCQ'. However, if FAMILY is not \"SPARTAN6\", 'refresh_prbs' will be set low ('1'b0') after the defined delay. This implies this block is part of a design compatible with multiple FPGA families, and has different behaviors based on the target FPGA."
