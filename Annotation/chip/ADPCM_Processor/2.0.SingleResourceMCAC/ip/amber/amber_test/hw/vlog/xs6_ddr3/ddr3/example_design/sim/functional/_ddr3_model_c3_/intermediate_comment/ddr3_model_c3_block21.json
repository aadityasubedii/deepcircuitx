    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a timing check on the falling edge (negative edge) of a 'dqs_in' signal at index 11. It utilizes the 'always' keyword which is a procedural block that gets triggered whenever there is a de-assertion of the given 'dqs_in' signal. It ensures the activation of a named block 'dqs_neg_timing_check' with the index value 11, further ensuring that the digital input/output sequences are synchronized and delivered according to the specified requirements."
