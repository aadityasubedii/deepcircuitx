    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for error detection during data write operations on a specific port (port 3). It first checks if the port configuration (C_PORT_CONFIG[87:64]) is set to \"W32\" (writes of 32 bits). Next, it checks if the command enable signal (p3_cmd_en) is high, and then checks the command instruction (p3_cmd_instr[2] and p3_cmd_instr[0]) to verify it is a write-only operation. If all these conditions are met, an error message is displayed and the program execution is halted. This is designed to prevent invalid commands from being executed on write-only port 3 and to maintain data integrity."
