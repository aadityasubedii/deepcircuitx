    "block_comment": "This block samples data on the rising edge of the DQS signal in a DDR interface. The `always @(posedge dqs_odd[ 5])` construct specifies that the followed procedure happens at the positive edge of the dqs_odd signal with index 5, meaning when the transition is from low to high. When a positive-edge ( rising edge ) of the dqs_odd signal state is detected, it triggers the 'dqs_odd_receiver' function or procedure with 5 as the argument, which is likely used to manage information transfer across the data bus."
