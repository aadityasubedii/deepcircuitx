This block is responsible for managing the 'Busy_IRQ_rck' signal based on various conditions. At the positive edge of MRxClk or Reset, if Reset is high, the 'Busy_IRQ_rck' is made low indicating no interrupt. If the signal RxValid is high and signals RxStartFrm is high & RxReady is low, it implies valid data is being received but the receiver is not ready, thus 'Busy_IRQ_rck' is set high, indicating an interrupt. If the signal 'Busy_IRQ_syncb2' is high, 'Busy_IRQ_rck' is cleared, indicating no interrupt.
