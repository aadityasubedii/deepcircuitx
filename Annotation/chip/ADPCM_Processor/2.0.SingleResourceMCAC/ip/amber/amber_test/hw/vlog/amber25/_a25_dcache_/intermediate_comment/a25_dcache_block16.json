    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for choosing a \"way\" when there are exactly four \"ways\". Specifically, it assigns to 'next_way' the result of calling the 'pick_way' function with 'valid_bits_r' and 'random_num' as arguments. This function, not shown here, presumably returns a value representing one of the available \"ways\" based on the given valid bits and a pseudo-random number."
