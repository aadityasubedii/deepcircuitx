    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the synchronous operation of the 'RxAbortSync3' register. It is triggered by a positive edge of either the 'WB_CLK_I' (the clock signal) or 'Reset' signal. When a reset condition is detected, 'RxAbortSync3' is immediately set to 0. Otherwise, on each positive edge of the clock, the state of 'RxAbortSync2' is transferred asynchronously to 'RxAbortSync3'. This structure ensures the clocked synchronous operation of the 'RxAbortSync3' register."
