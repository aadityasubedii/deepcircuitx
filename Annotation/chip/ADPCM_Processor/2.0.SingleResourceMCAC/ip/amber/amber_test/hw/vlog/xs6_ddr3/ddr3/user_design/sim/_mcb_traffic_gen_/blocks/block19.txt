This block of code defines a synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue named `cmd_fifo` using the Verilog module `afifo`. The FIFO uses a write clock and read clock (`wr_clk` and `rd_clk`) provided by the input signal `clk_i`. It enables writing to the FIFO queue when the signal `cmd_fifo_wr` is high and the FIFO is not full. The data written into the FIFO are `cmd2flow_bl` and `cmd2flow_addr` packed into one. Similarly, it enables reading from the FIFO queue when the signal `cmd_fifo_rd` is high and the FIFO is not empty. The read data `xfer_cmd_bl` and `xfer_addr` reflects the first item in the FIFO. The FIFO signals if it's full or empty with `cmd_fifo_full` and `cmd_fifo_empty` signals respectively. It instantiates the `afifo` with a few parameters such as depth of 16, address size of 4, and data size of 38.
