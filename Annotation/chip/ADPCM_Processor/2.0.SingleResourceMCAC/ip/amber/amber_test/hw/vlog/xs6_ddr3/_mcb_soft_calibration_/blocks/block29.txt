Comment: 
This block of code manages a state transition within a memory controller. The transition is conditional, based on the signal MCB_RDY_BUSY_N. If MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is not asserted, the STATE is set to "UDQS_CLK_P_TERM_WAIT". However, if MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is asserted, signalling that the memory controller is ready and not busy, the STATE is set to "UDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM". Within the UDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM state, the IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR is updated with value from `NTerm`.
