    "block_comment": "This block of code is a multiplexer selector for output registers. The selector input 'i_rn_sel' determines which register value (r0_out through r15_out_rn) is assigned to output 'o_rn'. If 'i_rn_sel' is '4'd0', 'r0_out' is assigned; if 'i_rn_sel' is '4'd1', 'r1_out' is assigned and so forth. When 'i_rn_sel' is '4'd14', 'r14_out' is assigned. By default, 'r15_out_rn' is assigned."
