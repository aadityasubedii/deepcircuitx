    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a timing check triggered on the falling edge of a DQS input signal (Data Strobe, a specific type of DDR memory signal, at bit 29). The DQS signal is used to synchronize read or write operations. The block ensures that the actual data timing stays within the expected range to avoid any data corruption or loss. The block invokes the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function when there is a negative edge in the `dqs_in[29]` signal, ensuring correct timing and synchronization."
