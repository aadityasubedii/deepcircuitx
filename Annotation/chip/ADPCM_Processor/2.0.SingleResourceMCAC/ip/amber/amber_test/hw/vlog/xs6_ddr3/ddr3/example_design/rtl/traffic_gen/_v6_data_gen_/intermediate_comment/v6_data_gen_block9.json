    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs a bitwise XOR operation on the data input vectors, hdata and w1data. The operation is always enabled whenever there is a change in hdata or w1data. The iterative procedure uses a loop of size four times the number of data input pins, NUM_DQ_PINS. The loop counter starts from 0, increments by 1 each cycle till it reaches 4*NUM_DQ_PINS - 1. During each iteration, the corresponding indices of hdata and w1data are XOR'd together, with the result stored in the corresponding index of the output vector, ndata."
