This block creates an OSERDES2 module for DDR3 memory if `C_MEM_TYPE` equals to `"DDR3"`, configured with specific parameters. The OSERDES2 module acts as a Serializer/Deserializer in the FPGA transmitting the incoming data in series. The reset signal, configuration, and other parameters are supplied by input constants and internal signals. The `ioi_rst_0` instance gets the reset, lock, and clock signals inserted into its relevant ports. The `OQ` port outputs the serial data generated within the OSERDES2 instance using these inputs, performing a critical role in memory operations.
