    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a real-time monitor for the second bit (bit '1') of the ba_in signal. Whenever there's a change in the value of that specific bit in the ba_in input, the cmd_addr_timing_check function is triggered. This function, which is defined elsewhere and takes a single argument, is called with value '5'. The execution of this function provides an internal mechanism for managing timing checks initiated by changes in certain bits of our input. The block operates asynchronously, supervised by events on the specified signal bit."
