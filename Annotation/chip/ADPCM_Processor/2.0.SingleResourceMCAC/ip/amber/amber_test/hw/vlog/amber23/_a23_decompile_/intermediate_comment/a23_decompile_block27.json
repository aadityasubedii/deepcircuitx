    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for decoding instructions based on instruction type (itype) and opcode. The decoded instruction is then stored in the xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE register. The block first checks if the execution should occur now. If not, the current instruction is saved, else it determines the instruction based on the opcode. Various instruction types are considered, such as REGOP, BRANCH, MULTIOP, etc., and each type contains checks against different opcodes (like ADD, MUL, SUB, etc.). Based on the itype and opcode, the corresponding instruction execution string is assigned to xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE. In case none of the conditions meet, \"unkow\" is assigned indicating an unknown instruction."
