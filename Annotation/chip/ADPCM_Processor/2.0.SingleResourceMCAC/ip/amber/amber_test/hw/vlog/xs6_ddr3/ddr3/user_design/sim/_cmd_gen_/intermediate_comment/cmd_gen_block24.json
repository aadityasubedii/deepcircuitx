    "block_comment": "This line of code represents a continuous assignment operation in Verilog RTL design. It essentially transfers the value stored in 'addr_counts' to 'seq_addr'. The 'assign' keyword keeps 'seq_addr' and 'addr_counts' in persistent equivalence; thus whenever 'addr_counts' is updated, 'seq_addr' is simultaneously adjusted. This operation is essential for implementing constructs where real-time tracking or mirroring of variable values is essential."
