    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is a task that translates the given instructions into a specific output format. It receives an input instruction, retrieves the necessary register information using the `warmreg` function, and then formats and writes this and other necessary information into the `decompile_file`, depending on the bit pattern of the input instruction. It uses a `casez` statement with the bit pattern formed from several parameters as the case expression. For each case, different encoded information is written to the file, e.g., register info, offset number, a potentially modified register info, etc. It employs the `warmreg` function to decode register information and `$fwrite` to write the translation to the `decompile_file`."
