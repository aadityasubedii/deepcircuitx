    "block_comment": "The code block represents a reset delay logic line for two reset signals (rst_ra, rst_rb) using a serial shift register. The reset signals (rst_ra and rst_rb) are updated every rising edge of the input clock signal (clk_i). This is implemented through a delay model (#TCQ) which forms a shift register, the rst_i input propagates through the delay model before they get assigned to rst_ra and rst_rb."
