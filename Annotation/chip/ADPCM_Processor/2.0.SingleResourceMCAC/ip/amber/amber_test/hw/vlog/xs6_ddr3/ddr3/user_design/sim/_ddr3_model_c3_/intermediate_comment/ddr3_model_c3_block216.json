    "block_comment": "This block initializes and resets all the parameters of a memory system. It chiefly controls and manipulates the inputs and states of the read and write data registers, data qualifiers, on-die termination, dynamic on-die termination, precharge for different banks, initialization stages, modes, DLL (delay-locked loop) operations, and pipeline stages for different commands. Initialization and resets are achieved through direct assignment of default or zero values to all parameters needed for the system's operation. Multibit parameters such as wdqs_pos_cntr are reset in a for loop that iterates through their indices. For some 1-bit parameters, an 'x' (unknown) state is assigned."
