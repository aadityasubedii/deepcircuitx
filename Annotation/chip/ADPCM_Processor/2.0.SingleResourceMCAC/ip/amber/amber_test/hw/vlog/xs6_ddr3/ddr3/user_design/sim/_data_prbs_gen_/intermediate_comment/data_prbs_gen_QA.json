This module generates a PRBS based on a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) process. The initial seed for this process can be provided through the input ports. The generator can be controlled by the clock signal (clk_i), the clock enable input (clk_en), and a reset signal (rst_i). The output from this module is the PRBS which is of the width specified by the parameter (PRBS_WIDTH). This module is highly configurable and can be adjusted based on the parameters provided at the instantiation. It also includes a clock delay mechanism using the \"TCQ\" parameter for simulation purposes."

It drives the LFSR to generate the pseudo-random binary sequence.\n2. clk_en: This is the clock enable input. When this signal is high, the LFSR operates normally. When this signal is low, the LFSR pauses its operation.\n3. rst_i: This is the reset input. When this signal is high, it resets the LFSR and loads it with a predefined seed.\n4. prbs_fseed_i: This 32-bit fixed seed input gets added to prbs_seed_i to form the initial loading value for the LFSR.\n5. prbs_seed_init: When this is high, the LFSR is reseeded with the value of {prbs_seed_i + prbs_fseed_i[31:0] + 32'h55555555}.\n6. prbs_seed_i: This is the seed input for the PRBS generator. This can be a dynamic value which upon provided, reseeds the LFSR.
