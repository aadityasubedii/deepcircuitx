Comment: 
This block of Verilog code validates incoming unicast packets by checking if the packet destination MAC address matches the receiving device MAC address. It operates by triggering at positive edges of the MRxClk or Reset signals. Initially, it sets 'UnicastOK' as 0. If 'Reset' is asserted, it keeps 'UnicastOK' deasserted, i.e., no unicast packet is valid. But in the absence of 'Reset', for every ByteCntEq (from 2 to 7), it checks if corresponding 8 bits of received data RxData matches with MAC. The 'UnicastOK' signal is kept asserted throughout if it matches, indicating successful unicast packet reception. However, reception of 'RxEndFrm' or 'RxAbort' triggers resetting of 'UnicastOK' to 0, marking end or abortion of packet reception.
