Comment: 
This block of code handles the control and state of cache hits in exclusive read operations. Upon rising edges of reset or clock signal, if reset signal is asserted, the read hit register ('ex_read_hit_r') and the read hit way ('ex_read_hit_way') are initialized to defaults. If an exclusive read hit is flagged, the block enters a debug state where it displays the hit address and sets the read hit register to 1 and corresponding read hit way. If the cache state indicates 'fill complete' and there is an exclusive read hit, it assigns the selected way to the read hit way.
