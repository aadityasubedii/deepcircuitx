    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code serves as the synchronization and control sequence for the execution stage in a pipeline architecture. Specifically, it resets the execution stage variables when the 'reset' signal is asserted. Otherwise, under the clock's positive edge, if there is no stall and an instruction is valid, preparation for the execution of the instruction is performed. Irrespective of whether an instruction is valid or stalled, on every positive edge of the clock signal, the \u2018execute_now\u2019 variable gets updated, informing whether an instruction execution must initiate or not."
