    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is used to configure and initialize the memory pattern generator for port 3 and the corresponding memory controller based traffic generator, conditional on C_PORT_ENABLE[3] being set to 1. When C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is set, the init_mem_pattern_ctr and mcb_traffic_gen modules are instantiated with specific configuration parameters such as data width, family, begin and end addresses, seed values, modes, etc. These modules interface with memory controller commands, and they accept clock signals, reset signals, addresses, seeds, modes, errors, etc., on their input ports, and produce signals like start and end addresses, seeds, modes etc., on their output ports. If C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is not set to 1, then port 3 error, error status, cmp_data, cmp_data_valid, and cmp_error ports are assigned a 'b0 value."
