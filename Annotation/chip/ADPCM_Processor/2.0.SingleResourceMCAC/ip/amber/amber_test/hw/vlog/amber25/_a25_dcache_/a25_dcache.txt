Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple ways (2-8).
It manages cache hits/misses, read/write requests, and external memory interfacing. The cache
uses parameterized design for flexibility, employs random replacement policy, and features
cache line filling, write-back, exclusive access, and flushing. It utilizes separate tag and
data RAM structures, state machines for control, and way selection logic to achieve its functionality.
