    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for capturing the rising edge of the 14th bit of the `dqs_odd` signal by employing an `always` block, activating the `dqs_odd_receiver` process specifically for this bit. The implementation is accomplished using a sensitivity list that reacts solely to the positive edge of the `dqs_odd[14]` bit. This allows it to precisely follow the changes of this bit and pass its value to the `dqs_odd_receiver` process."
