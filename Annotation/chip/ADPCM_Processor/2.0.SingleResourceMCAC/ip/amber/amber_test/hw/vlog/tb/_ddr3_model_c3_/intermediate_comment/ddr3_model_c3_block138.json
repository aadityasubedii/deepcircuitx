    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a function which is essentially testing and flagging a timing violation for the 10th (index 9) element of the `dm_in` bit-vector. The function is achieved by scheduling the procedure `dm_timing_check` to be invoked every time the state of `dm_in[ 9]` changes. The input to this function refers to the specific index of the bit vector that should be checked."
