Comment: 
This Verilog block defines a task, `chk_err`, that checks for timing violations based on the DDR SDRAM switching characteristics. The implementation leverages a casex statement for different command sequences and their relationships (same bank, different bank, etc.). For each potential violation, a specific timing constraint is checked, for instance checking a `tRRD` violation during an 'ACTIVATE' command. If a violation is detected, an error message with details is printed out. Bank-specific states and time markers are stored and updated based on commands, thus implementing fine-grained tracking of timing behavior between memory banks.
