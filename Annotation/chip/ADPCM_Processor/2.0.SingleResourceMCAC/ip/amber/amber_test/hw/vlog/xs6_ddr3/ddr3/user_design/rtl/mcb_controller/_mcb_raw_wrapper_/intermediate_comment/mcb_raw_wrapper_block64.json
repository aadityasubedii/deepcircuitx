    "block_comment": "The block of code configures read/write protocols for a memory interface (MIG). Depending on the settings in the C_PORT_CONFIG and C_PORT_ENABLE, this block either sets up connections between key interface signals (mig_p3_xx) and protocol specific signals (p3_rd/wr_xx) or forcefully clears these signals. When the third port is enabled (C_PORT_ENABLE[3] == 1'b1), and its configuration matches ('B32', 'R32'), all the read signals connect directly to their corresponding MIG signals, basically enabling data flow. For other cases (either the port is not enabled or the configuration doesn\u2019t match), the signals are set to logical '0' indicating no data flow or potential errors, protecting the memory interface from incorrect data access or configuration."
