    "block_comment": "This line of code is assigning the data read from the Wishbone bus to the output wire `o_wb_dat`. The Wishbone bus is a common hardware interconnection standard for System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. Here, `wb_rdata128` is the variable storing the 128-bit data read from the Wishbone bus, and it is being assigned to `o_wb_dat`, which presumably is connected to the logic that utilizes this bus data."
