    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/* \nThis module implements a memory controller wrapper supporting multiple ports and memory types.\nIt interfaces with external memory, handling command, write, and read operations through \nconfigurable ports. The wrapper manages memory calibration, port arbitration, and AXI4 protocol \ninterfacing. It uses a combination of input clocks, reset signals, and port-specific controls \nto coordinate memory operations, while providing status signals and memory interface outputs.\n*/"
