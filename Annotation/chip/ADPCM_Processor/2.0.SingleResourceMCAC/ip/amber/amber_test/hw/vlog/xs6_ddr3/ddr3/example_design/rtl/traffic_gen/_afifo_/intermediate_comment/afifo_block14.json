    "block_comment": "This line of code is responsible for assigning the value of `wr_ptr` to `wr_addr`. The use of the `assign` keyword implies that this operation will always be active, updating `wr_addr` whenever `wr_ptr` changes. This typically signifies a part of a circuit where data written at some pointer location needs to be accessed or stored at some address location."
