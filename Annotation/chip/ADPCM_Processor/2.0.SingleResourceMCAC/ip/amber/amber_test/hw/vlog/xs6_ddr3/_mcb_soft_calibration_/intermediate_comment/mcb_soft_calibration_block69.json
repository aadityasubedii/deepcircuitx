    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a dynamic calibration control module. It resets and manages calibration state based on the system state conditions. At the rising edge of UI_CLK, if a restart (RST) is triggered, it resets the dynamic calibration flags. It also latches state of PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH flag to PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH_R1 for the next cycle. In absence of RST, the START_DYN_CAL_STATE_R1 flag is set if the system state (STATE) is in START_DYN_CAL, otherwise it is reset. Furthermore, conditions based on states for WAIT_SELFREFRESH_EXIT_DQS_CAL, START_DYN_CAL, and SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE_R3 set or reset the PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH flag."
