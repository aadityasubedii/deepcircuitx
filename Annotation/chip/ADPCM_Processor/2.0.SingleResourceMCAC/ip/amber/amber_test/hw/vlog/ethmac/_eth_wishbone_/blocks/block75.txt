Comment: 
This block is responsible for the synchronous reset and data update of the `ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb1` register. The update happens on either a positive edge of `MTxClk` (Main Transmission Clock) or `Reset` signal. When a reset signal is asserted, the `ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb1` register is immediately set to 0. In the absence of a reset (in the normal operating condition), the value of `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync2` is transferred to `ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb1` with a delay of `Tp` (Transmission propogation delay) for synchronization.
