Module name: a23_wishbone. 

Module specification: The a23_wishbone module interfaces with the Wishbone protocol for synchronous data transmission between peripherals and FPGA cores. It handles read and write requests from a CPU core or cache module and controls different types of service requests using a state machine. The module provides signals to pause operations when Wishbone bus is occupied and exports the status of bus operations for debugging. 

The module has numerous input ports such as `i_clk` for clock signals, `i_select` which enables the module, `i_write_data` for input data, `i_write_enable` to initiate a write operation, `i_byte_enable` for byte selection during write operation, `i_address` as the address location for operations, `i_exclusive` to indicate exclusive access requests and `i_cache_req` for request signals from the cache. There are also inputs from the Wishbone bus itself, `i_wb_dat` for data, `i_wb_ack` for acknowledgement and `i_wb_err` for error handling. The output ports include stalling signal `o_stall`, signals for addressing, byte selection and write commitment to the Wishbone bus (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`), data output for write operations (`o_wb_dat`), signals marking valid bus cycles and validity of data/address (`o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb`). 

Additionally, it uses internal signals like `wishbone_st` and `wbuf_busy_r` which respectively denote state of the Wishbone operation and write buffer status, and signals like `read_ack` and `wait_write_ack` for acknowledgement of read/write operations. The `start_access` and `exclusive_access` signals are used for initiation of core or cache requests and exclusive access request status respectively. The module contains dedicated states for different phases of operation in a state machine implementation. 

The code can be broken down into sections with unique functionality, for instance, several always blocks which handle write buffer operations, data transfer to Wishbone bus and transitions of the Wishbone state machine.
