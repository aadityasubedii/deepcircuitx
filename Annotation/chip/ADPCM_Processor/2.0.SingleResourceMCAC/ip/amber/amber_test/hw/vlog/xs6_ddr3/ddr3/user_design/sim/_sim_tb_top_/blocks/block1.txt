Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for logging the status of a calibration process. It initiates two parallel processes, `calibration_done` and `calib_not_done`. The first process waits for the 'calib_done' signal, then prints a message and after a delay of '50000000' units of simulation time, checks if there was any error. If no errors, it prints "TEST PASSED" else it prints "TEST FAILED: DATA ERROR". Post that, it disables the `calib_not_done` process and ends the test. The second process waits for '200000000' units of simulation time. If the 'calib_done' signal has not been received, it prints "TEST FAILED: INITIALIZATION DID NOT COMPLETE", disables the `calibration_done` process and ends the test. The two processes `calibration_done` and `calib_not_done` are under a 'fork-join' block, which means both processes are initiated simultaneously and the program waits until both are done.
