This Verilog block of code handles a Wishbone control interface for memory accesses. In the `WB_IDLE` state, the process initializes its outputs and checks for both read and write requests. If a start access is detected, it sets up the memory selection and wishbone signals, and then determines the next state based on the type of request. It also maps the byte enable to bits of the address, supporting different byte lineups. In the `WB_BURST` states, the Wishbone control increments address for burst memory access, until it gets acknowledgment from memory, before transitioning to the `WB_WAIT_ACK` state. If a memory acknowledgment is received during `WB_WAIT_ACK`, it toggles back to the `WB_IDLE` state and prepares for the next memory request by resetting most of its output signals.
