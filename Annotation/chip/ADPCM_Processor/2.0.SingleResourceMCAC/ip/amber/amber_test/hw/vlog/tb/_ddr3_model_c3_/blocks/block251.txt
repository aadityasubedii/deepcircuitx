This block initializes the `cmd_addr_string` array with string representations of the command addresses used in a memory system design. It's implemented in Verilog's `initial` begin-end block, which runs once at the start of the simulation. The block assigns human-readable labels, such as `CS_N`, `RAS_N`, and various `ADDR` and `BA` entries, to individual indices of the array. This initialization aids in the readability and understanding of generated cmd_addr_string during the simulation.
