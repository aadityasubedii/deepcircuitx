    "block_comment": "The block is used for reading from memory. It implements this by using an assign statement, which is a continuous assignment statement in Verilog, to continuously assign the data stored at the memory address specified by 'rd_addr' to the 'rd_data' wire. The data in memory at 'rd_addr' is read out whenever 'rd_addr' changes and is continuously available at 'rd_data'."
