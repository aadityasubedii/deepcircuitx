    "block_comment": "The block assigns a value to `TxStatusWrite` based on a set of conditions. It uses bitwise operations including OR, AND, and NOT operators for comparing and merging different signals. If `TxDonePacket_NotCleared` or `TxAbortPacket_NotCleared` is high, and `TxEn` along with `TxEn_q` is high, while `BlockingTxStatusWrite` is low, `TxStatusWrite` goes high, signifying that a Transmission Status Write operation is called for in this state."
