    "block_comment": "This block triggers a negative timing check on the 18th bit of 'dqs_in' data upon its rising edge. The Verilog RTL code uses the 'always' keyword to continuously monitor the dqs_in[17] variable. Upon the positive edge, the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' is called with 17 as the function argument, instigating the necessary logic procedures to ensure proper timing."
