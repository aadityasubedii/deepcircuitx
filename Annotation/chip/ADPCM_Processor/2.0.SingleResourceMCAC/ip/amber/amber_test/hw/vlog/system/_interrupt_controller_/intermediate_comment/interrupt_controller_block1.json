    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code manages read and write operations to the interrupt controller's various registers, through the use of a Wishbone interface. It listens to clock cycles and initiates the debugging message as a response to either a read acknowledgment or a write commencement. Depending on whether there's a write or read operation, it prints different messages followed by the data value being transacted. Then it identifies the concerned register using the switch case block that matches the address bits to predefined register codes (AMBER ICs). For undefined addresses, it logs an error message indicating the unknown address. The operations are synchronous, tied to the positive edge of the input clock signal."
