    "block_comment": "This block handles interrupt processing in the context of an instruction pipeline. Whenever a valid instruction coincides with an interrupt signal, and the next interrupt is not '6', the block initiates an interrupt routine. Specifically, it overlays the execution of the current instruction and then determines the next register write selection based on whether the next interrupt is '4'. The block writes to the register bank, sets the next instruction address and program counter selectors, modifies the status bits for the mode, IRQ mask and, if the next interrupt is '2', sets the status bits for the FIRQ mask."
