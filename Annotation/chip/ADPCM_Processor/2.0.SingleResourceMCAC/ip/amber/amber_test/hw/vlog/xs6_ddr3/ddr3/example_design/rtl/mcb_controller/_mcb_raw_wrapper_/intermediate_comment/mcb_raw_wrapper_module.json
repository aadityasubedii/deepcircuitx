    "module": "Module-level comment: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) that interfaces with external DDR/DDR2/DDR3 memory. It manages low-level I/O operations, including data read/write, address handling, and command signals. The module implements IOB instantiation, IODRP2 components for DQ/DQS signals, and OSERDES2 for data serialization. It supports multiple port configurations, various memory types, and different data widths. The module also handles clock generation, reset management, and calibration processes, providing a flexible interface between user logic and external memory."
