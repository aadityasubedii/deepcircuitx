    "block_comment": "This block is a procedural always block that checks for changes on the 7th bit (bit 6 as index starts at 0) of the addr_in variable. When a change on this bit is detected, the 'cmd_addr_timing_check(13)' function is executed. The function likely checks some timing constrain on the hardware design, with a specific configuration set by the parameter '13'."
