    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for the process of assuring data validation while maintaining the FIFO buffer's status. The block utilizes the bitwise AND operation to ensure `data_valid_o` only becomes true if data validity (`data_valid`) is confirmed, and the FIFO buffer is not full (`fifo_not_full`). Hence, it prevents overfilling of the buffer and ensures data integrity."
