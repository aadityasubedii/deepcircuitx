    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the variable `user_bl_cnt_is_1` based on certain conditions. If the conditions `user_burst_cnt` being equal to 2, `data_port_fifo_rdy` being asserted, and either `FAMILY` being equal to either \"SPARTAN6\" or \"VIRTEX6\" are all true, it assigns `user_bl_cnt_is_1` with a time delay defined by `TCQ` to 1; otherwise, it assigns it with the same delay to 0. This is executed on the positive edge of clock signal `clk_i`."
