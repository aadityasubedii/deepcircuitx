Comment: 
This block of Verilog code triggers a function whenever there is a negative edge on the 19th bit of the signal `dqs_in`. The function `dqs_pos_timing_check` is then called with parameter `18`, which could be possibly used inside the function to specifically analyze or manipulate only the 19th bit of some signal or operation. The intention behind this design can be to precisely and immediately respond to any state changes in the 19th bit of `dqs_in`.
