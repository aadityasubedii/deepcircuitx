    "block_comment": "The 'open_bank_file' function is purposed for opening a file with a particular bank number and returning a file descriptor for that file. In the implementation, a filename is formed using the bank number and a directory. Then, it tries to open the file with write and read permissions. If it fails to open, an error message is displayed and the simulation is finished. Otherwise, a debug message is displayed indicating successful file opening, and the opened file descriptor is returned."
