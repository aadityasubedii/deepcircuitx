    "block_comment": "This code block performs a bitwise inversion and logical AND operation. Specifically, it employs two input signals, `CtrlMux` and `TxUsedDataIn`, and produces an output signal `TxUsedDataOut`. The bitwise inversion NOT (`~`) operator inverts the bits of its operand `CtrlMux`, and the logical AND (`&`) operator then performs a binary AND operation between the inverted `CtrlMux` and `TxUsedDataIn`. The result of the AND operation is assigned to `TxUsedDataOut`."
