    "block_comment": "This block of code creates a conditional assignment for `read_data_filtered_c`. If `i_wb_read_data_valid` is true, `read_data_filtered` is assigned; otherwise, the output is `read_data_filtered_r`. This construct is typically employed in conditional data routing or multiplexing scenarios, where the output is determined based on the value of a certain control or status signal."
