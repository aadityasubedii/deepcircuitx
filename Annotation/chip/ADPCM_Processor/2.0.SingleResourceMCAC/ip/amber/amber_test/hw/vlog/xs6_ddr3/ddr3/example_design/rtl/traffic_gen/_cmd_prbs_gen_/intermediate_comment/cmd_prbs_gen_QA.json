It has capability to generate PRBS sequences of various lengths (32 bit, 64 bit, 20 bit) based on the parameters passed during its instantiation. It utilizes a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) technique for generating the sequences. The sequences generation can be controlled using input signals like 'prbs_seed_init', 'clk_en'. The initial seed for the sequences can be provided through 'prbs_seed_i' signal. The generated sequence is available on 'prbs_o' output port. Also, it takes care of mask setting for start and end addresses in case of address sequence generation."

When this signal is high, the 'lfsr_q' register is initialized with the seed value given in 'prbs_seed_i' port.\n- clk_en: The clock enable signal.

It is used in LFSR sequence modification in case of instruction and burst length command PRBS generation.\n\n- prbs: This is an internal register signal of width equal to SEED_WIDTH.
