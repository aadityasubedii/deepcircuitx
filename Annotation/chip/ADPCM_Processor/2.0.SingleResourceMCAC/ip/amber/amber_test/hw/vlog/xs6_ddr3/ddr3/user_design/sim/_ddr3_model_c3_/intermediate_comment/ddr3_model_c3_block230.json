    "block_comment": "The function `get_rtt_wr` calculates the impedance matching value. It takes a 2-bit input 'rtt' and returns an integer that corresponds to the impedance matching control word. The execution involves dividing a set impedance value 'RZQ' by a value crafted from padding 'rtt' with a 0 at its least significant bit. This is done to map the rtt input to a physical ohm value, which can then be used in the impedance matching process."
