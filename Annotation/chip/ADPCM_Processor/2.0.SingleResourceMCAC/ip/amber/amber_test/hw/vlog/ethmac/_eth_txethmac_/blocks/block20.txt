The block of code manages the triggering event 'StopExcessiveDeferOccured'. The event is reset at every rising edge of the 'MTxClk' or 'Reset' signals, setting 'StopExcessiveDeferOccured' to 0. If neither of these conditions is met but 'TxStartFrm' is not set, 'StopExcessiveDeferOccured' is also set to 0. In the case where 'ExcessiveDeferOccured' is active, 'StopExcessiveDeferOccured' is accordingly set to 1. This block thus controls the occurrence of excessive defers based on specific conditions and resets.
