    "block_comment": "This block is a state update block in a clocked digital circuit or processor implemented in Verilog. The block listens for a rising edge in the clock signal and updates a series of output and internal state variables, either with their next-state calculated values or retains their present values, based on respective update flags. The block implements multiplexing operations by using ternary operators, where the decision is controlled by different update flags. For instance, `o_priviledged` gets updated with the value of `priviledged_nxt` if `priviledged_update` is true and maintains its old value otherwise. Each expression in this block follows a similar pattern. Therefore, every clock cycle, this block decides whether to keep or update the state of a list of variables used probably in a complex digital system."
