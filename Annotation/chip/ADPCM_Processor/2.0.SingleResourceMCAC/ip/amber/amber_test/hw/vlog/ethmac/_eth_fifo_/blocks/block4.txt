Comment: 
This block of code manages the write pointer for a buffer system in Verilog. Upon receiving a positive edge of a reset signal, it initializes the write pointer to zero, effectively starting the pointer anew. In the presence of a clear signal, it adjusts the write pointer to keep space for new write operations. Finally, if write command is enabled and the buffer is not marked as full, the code increments the write pointer, allowing new elements to be added to the buffer system.
