    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for implementing a data receiver in sync with the rising edge of the dqs_odd data stream. The implementation is accomplished using an \"always\" block that triggers on the positive edge of the 9th element of the dqs_odd array, indicating that the data receiver function, dqs_odd_receiver, is called every time this event occurs."
