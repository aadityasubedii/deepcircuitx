    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for transferring the state of the `instr_vld` signal to the `instr_vld_dly1` register. The operation takes place at the positive edge of the clock signal `clk_i`, which ensures synchronous operation of the design, following the clock signal. This design employs a delay element that maps the input to the output with a one-cycle delay, denoted by `#TCQ` (Time Clock to Q), which signifies the propagation delay from clock input to output."
