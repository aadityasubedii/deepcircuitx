    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates a check for the positive edge timing of the DQS (Data Strobe) signal each time there is a falling edge in the 24th bit of the dqs_in signal. This is implemented through the invocation of the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function with the parameter `23`, which corresponds to the index of the DQS signal under consideration."
