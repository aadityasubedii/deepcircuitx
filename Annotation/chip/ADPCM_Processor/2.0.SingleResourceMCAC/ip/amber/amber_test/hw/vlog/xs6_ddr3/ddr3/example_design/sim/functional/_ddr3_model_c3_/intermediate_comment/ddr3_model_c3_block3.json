    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for clock edge detection, specifically it detects the positive edge of the 30th bit of the incoming DQS signal. When the 30th bit of the DQS signal transitions from low to high (positive edge), it triggers an instance of the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function targeted at the 30th bit (index 29)."
