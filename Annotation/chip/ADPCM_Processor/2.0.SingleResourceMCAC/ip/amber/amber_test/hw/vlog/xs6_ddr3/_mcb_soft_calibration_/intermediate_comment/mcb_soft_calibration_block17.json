    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a state transition within a finite state machine. The state, labeled as LDQS_WAIT1, checks the status of MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal. If the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal is not active (Logic LOW), the state remains at LDQS_WAIT1 indicating the machine is busy. If the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal is active (Logic HIGH), it triggers a state transition to LDQS_WRITE_NEG_INDELAY reflecting readiness for a new operation."
