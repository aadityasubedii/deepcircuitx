    "block_comment": "The block of code functions primarily as a switch between two different signals controlled by the 'normal_operation_window' signal. It delegates the 'gated_pll_lock' signal to either 'pll_lock' or 'syn_uiclk_pll_lock', based on the state of 'normal_operation_window'. If 'normal_operation_window' is high (1), 'gated_pll_lock' will mirror the state of 'pll_lock' signal, otherwise, it mirrors 'syn_uiclk_pll_lock'. The use of an always block denotes this as a combinational logic module."
