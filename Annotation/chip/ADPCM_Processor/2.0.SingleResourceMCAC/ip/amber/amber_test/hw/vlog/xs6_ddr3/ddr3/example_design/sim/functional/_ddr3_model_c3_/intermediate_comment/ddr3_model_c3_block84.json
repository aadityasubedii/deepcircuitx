    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is primarily used for checking the timing for '46th' element of the `dq_in` input array. Implementation-wise, this is achieved using an 'always' block which gets triggered every time there is any change in '46th' element of the `dq_in` array. Upon triggered, it calls the `dq_timing_check` function with an argument of '46', expected to check the timing of the corresponding dq signal."
