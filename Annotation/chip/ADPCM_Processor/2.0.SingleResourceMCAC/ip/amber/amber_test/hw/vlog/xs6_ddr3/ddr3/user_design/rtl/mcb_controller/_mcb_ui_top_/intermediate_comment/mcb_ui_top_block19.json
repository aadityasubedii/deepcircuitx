    "block_comment": "The block handles the condition when AXI interface S1 is disabled: data isn't fetched from or loaded into it in that case. Upon this condition, all related control signals are directly assigned their input signal values without any computational logic or modification, essentially achieving a passthrough mode. Input signals like enable, clock, instruction, block address etc., for cmd, wr, and rd sections are assigned directly to their respective internal signals. Similarly, status signals regarding full, empty, and error states, and the read/write count from these sections' internal signals are forwarded out as output signals."
