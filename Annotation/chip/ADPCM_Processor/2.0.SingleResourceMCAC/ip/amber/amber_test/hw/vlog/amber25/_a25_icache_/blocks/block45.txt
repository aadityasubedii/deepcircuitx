Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for updating a register, 'address_r', based on the status of the system reset and clock signal. Instantiated in an always block, 'address_r' is reset to decimal value zero on a positive edge trigger of the 'reset' signal. However, on a positive edge trigger of the 'clk' signal in the absence of a system reset, 'address_r' is updated to the value of 'address_c'.
