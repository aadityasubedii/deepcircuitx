    "block_comment": "Without a specific Verilog code block present, I can only provide a general procedure for transforming raw Verilog RTL codes into a suitable format for training a language model.\n\nSplitting: The first step involves splitting the raw Verilog codes into separate sections. These sections could be modules, generate blocks, always blocks, assign statements or any other significant Verilog hierarchy. Each section is associated with an intent or purpose which constitutes the summary. \n\nPairing: Every segment of the Verilog code is paired with its corresponding intent or summary. This would depend on the detailed knowledge of the Verilog RTL code functionality.\n\nData Cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant text, extra spaces, comments, and special characters from the code sections. The intent summaries can also be processed by correcting grammatical errors, removing filler words, and ensuring they stay within the 100 token limit.\n\nFormatting: The processed pairs of code sections and intent summaries are then formatted properly into a 'from-to' structure where one entity acts as the source (Verilog RTL code) and the other as the target (Summary).\n\nTraining: The model can now be trained on these paired sequences to carry out its task of generating coherent summaries for Verilog RTL code blocks. \n\nWe can incorporate these steps in a script to automate the preprocessing, making it effective and efficient."
