    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code, labeled as INC_PTERM, mainly functions to increment the variable P_Term and transition the state machine to the LOAD_RZQ_PTERM state. The increment operation on P_Term is achieved by using the verilog non-blocking assignment operator \"<=\" which resolves all right hand side variables first before updating the left hand side. The state transition is also carried out using the non-blocking assignment, ensuring smooth state transitions.\n"
