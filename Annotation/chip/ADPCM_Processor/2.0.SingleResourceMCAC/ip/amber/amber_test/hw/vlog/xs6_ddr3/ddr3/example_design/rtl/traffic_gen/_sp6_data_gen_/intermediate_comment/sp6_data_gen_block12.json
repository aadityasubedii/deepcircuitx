    "block_comment": "This code block is a conditional statement inside a generate construct, used in the synthesis of configurable hardware components in Verilog. It activates a specific mode of the data controller when its width (DWIDTH) is 128 and when it receives specific patterns (\"DGEN_WALKING0\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", or \"DGEN_ALL\"). The internal name of the generated block is 'WALKING_ONE_128_PATTERN'."
