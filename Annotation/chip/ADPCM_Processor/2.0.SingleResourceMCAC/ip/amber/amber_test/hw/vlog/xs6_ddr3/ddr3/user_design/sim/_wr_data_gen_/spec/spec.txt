Module name: wr_data_gen.

Module specification: The wr_data_gen is a parameterized digital logic subsystem written in Verilog, primarily engaged in data generation for various commands within a memory controller architecture, specifically for write operations. Its operation is adaptable with SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 FPGA families. It can either generate data randomly using a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS), or by using a predetermined fixed input data pattern. The module receives inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), seed for PRBS (prbs_fseed_i), data mode (data_mode_i), command valid signals (cmd_valid_i, cmd_validB_i, cmd_validC_i), fixed pattern data (fixed_data_i), address (addr_i), burst length (bl_i), and data readiness signal (data_rdy_i). The output signals include command readiness (cmd_rdy_o), last word indicator (last_word_o), data validity (data_valid_o), generated data (data_o), and the end of data writing signal (data_wr_end_o). 

Internally, the module has various signals and registers like cmd_start, cmd_rdy, user_burst_cnt, u_bcount_2, last_word_t and fifo_not_full, which work in tandem to control the flow, generation and validity of data.

The code is divided into blocks that handle different aspects of data generation and control. The always blocks at different positive edges of the clock signal control various conditions for readiness and validity of commands/data and update the user burst count. Generate commands are used to invoke either SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6 specific data generation sub-modules based on the FAMILY parameter, controlling the logical flow of data as per the data readiness and validity criteria, while the memory write process is ongoing. Thus, this module accurately manages the data generation and write processes for a memory controller.
