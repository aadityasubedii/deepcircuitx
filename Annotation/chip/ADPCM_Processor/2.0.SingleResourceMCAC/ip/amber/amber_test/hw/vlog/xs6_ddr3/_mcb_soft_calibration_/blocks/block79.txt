Comment: 
The block of code performs a logical AND operation between the RST signal and a condition signal, Rst_condition1. In Verilog, the "&" operator carries out the AND operation and the result is assigned to the signal "non_violating_rst." This operation ensures the reset of the system only when the RST signal is activated and when the condition Rst_condition1 is met.
