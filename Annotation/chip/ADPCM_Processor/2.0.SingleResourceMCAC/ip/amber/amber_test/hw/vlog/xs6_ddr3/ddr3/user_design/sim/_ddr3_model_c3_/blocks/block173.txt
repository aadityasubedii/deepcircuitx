This block is mainly monitoring violations of specific DDR memory constraints. It verifies real-time protocol adherence while in the "On-Die Termination" (ODT) mode of a DDR memory interface. These checks are conducted only when reset is not active, ODT is enabled and the system is not in self-refresh mode. Should the duration between the current time and the last clock signal occurrence be less than TIH (input high time), it logs an error indicating a tIH violation. It does the same for tIPW (input pulse width) based on the time difference between the current time and the last ODT signal occurrence.
