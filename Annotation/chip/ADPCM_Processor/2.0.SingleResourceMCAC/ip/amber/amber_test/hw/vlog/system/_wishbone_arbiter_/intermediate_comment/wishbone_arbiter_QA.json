Explanation: The module \"wishbone_arbiter\" acts as the design for a hardware arbiter in a Wishbone interconnection architecture. It is responsible for managing the control signals between various masters and slaves. A master can be a CPU or a DMA controller while a slave can be memory or a peripheral device. The arbiter helps in routing the request from a specific master to a selected slave and ensures that only one master can access a slave at any given time. Parameters WB_DWIDTH and WB_SWIDTH define data width and selection width respectively. The module also handles the read from/write to operations based on the current master and current slave. The selection of both the current master and slave is done based on the i_wb_clk signal and the address range of various devices. Error and acknowledgment signals are also managed through the arbiter."

The clock signal i_wb_clk is the main timing signal. The master signals start with 'i_m' followed by the master number and the signal type (adr for address, sel for selection, we for read/write, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe). Similarly, the slave signals start with 'i_s' followed by the slave number and the type of the signal (dat for data, ack for acknowledgment, and err for error).\n\nOutput Ports: \n1. o_m0_wb_dat and o_m1_wb_dat: Data output ports for master 0 and master 1.\n2. o_m0_wb_ack and o_m1_wb_ack: Acknowledgement signals to master 0 and master 1 of a successful read/write operation.\n3. o_m0_wb_err and o_m1_wb_err: Error signals to master 0 and master 1, indicating an error encountered during operation.\n4. o_s0_wb_adr to o_s7_wb_adr: Address output ports for slave 0 to slave 7.\n5. o_s0_wb_sel to o_s7_wb_sel: Selection signals for slave 0 to slave 7.\n6. o_s0_wb_we to o_s7_wb_we: Write enable signals for slave 0 to slave 7.\n7. o_s0_wb_dat to o_s7_wb_dat: Data output ports for slave 0 to slave 7.\n8. o_s0_wb_cyc to o_s7_wb_cyc: Cycle signals for slave 0 to slave 7.\n9. o_s0_wb_stb to o_s7_wb_stb: Strobe signals indicating the valid data address for slave 0 to slave 7.\n\nExplanation: \nOutput ports represent different data or control signals sent out by the module. The master output signal starts with 'o_m' followed by the master number and the signal type (dat for data, ack for acknowledgment, and err for error). The slave output signals start with 'o_s' followed by the slave number and the type of the signal (adr for address, sel for selection, we for write enable, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe).
