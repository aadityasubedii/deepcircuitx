    "block_comment": "This block of code governs the behavior of the RxLateCollision signal during a specific period in a Verilog logic design. The block is triggered on the positive edge of the MRxClk signal or the Reset signal. If the Reset signal is high, or if the LoadRxStatus signal is high, the RxLateCollision signal is asynchronously reset. However, if there is a collision, and either the r_FullD signal is low, or the RxColWindow signal is low or if r_RecSmall signal is high, then the RxLateCollision signal is set. This implementation details key aspects of collision detection in this logic design."
