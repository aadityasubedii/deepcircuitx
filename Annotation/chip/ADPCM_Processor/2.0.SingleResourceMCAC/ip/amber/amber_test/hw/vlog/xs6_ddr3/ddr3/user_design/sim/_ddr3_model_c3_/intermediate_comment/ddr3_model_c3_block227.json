    "block_comment": "This function computes the ceiling of a real number. It accepts a real as an input defined as 'number'. Inside the function, a condition checks if the input number is greater than the nearest integer rounded towards zero (obtained using the $rtoi function). If so, it assigns the next integer (obtained by adding 1 to the result of the $rtoi function) to the 'ceil', otherwise, the input 'number' itself is assigned to 'ceil'."
