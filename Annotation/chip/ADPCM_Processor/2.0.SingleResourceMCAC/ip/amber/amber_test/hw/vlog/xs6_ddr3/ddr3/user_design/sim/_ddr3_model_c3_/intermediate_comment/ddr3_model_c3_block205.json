    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for triggering the `dqs_even_receiver` function whenever there's a rising edge on the third bit of `dqs_even`. The entire function `dqs_even_receiver`, which expects an integer argument denoting which bit of `dqs_even` to evaluate, is invoked specifically with the value 3. This event-driven (also referred to as data flow) behavior is brought about using the `always` keyword followed by a sensitivity list, in this case, `posedge dqs_even[ 3]`, meaning the block responds to positive edge changes of the third bit of the `dqs_even`."
