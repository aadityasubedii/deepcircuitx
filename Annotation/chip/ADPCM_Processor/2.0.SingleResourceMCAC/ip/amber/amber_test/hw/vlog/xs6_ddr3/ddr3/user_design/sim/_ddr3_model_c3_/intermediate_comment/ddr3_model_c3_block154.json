    "block_comment": "This code block deals with cmd_addr_timing_check, a function for checking the timing commands at a specific address. The function is implemented as a `always` block in Verilog, which is a type of procedural block that carries out the instructions within it anytime there's a change in address in the specified bit of `addr_in[10]`. Specifically, the block invokes the function `cmd_addr_timing_check` with the argument `17` whenever the 10th bit of `addr_in` changes."
