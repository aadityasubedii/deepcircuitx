    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for assigning a boolean value to the `EnableCnt` variable. This resultant value is decided based on the logical operation embedded within the parenthesis. Specifically, the block uses bitwise negation on `DlyCrcEn`, followed by a bitwise OR operation with the conjunction of `DlyCrcEn` and bitwise AND operation of a 2-bit slice (1 to 0 positions) from `DlyCrcCnt`. This logic effectively implies `EnableCnt` will be set to true unless `DlyCrcEn` is false and the two least significant bits of `DlyCrcCnt` are not both true."
