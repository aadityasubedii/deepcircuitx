Comment: 
This block of code detects the rising edge of the `dqs_odd[9]` signal and triggers the `dqs_odd_receiver(9)` procedure at each occurrence. The key component here is an "always" block which is sensitive to a positive edge (`posedge`) of the `dqs_odd[9]` signal. When `dqs_odd[9]` transitions from low to high, the `dqs_odd_receiver(9)` procedure is executed.
