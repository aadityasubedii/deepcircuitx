    "block_comment": "This is a synchronous code block handling data writing. The block initializes on receiving a positive edge signal from `clk_i` and if `rst_i` is enabled, the data (`w1data`) is cleared. When `fifo_rdy_i` is ready and `user_burst_cnt` is not zero, or `cmd_startC` is true, it writes to `w1data` based on `NUM_DQ_PINS` which can be 16, 8 or 4. When 16, it writes subsequent shifts to its indexed positions. It has a specific mechanism for `data_mode_i == 3'b100`, reorganizing the data using shifting operations. Similar operations occur for 8 or 4 `NUM_DQ_PINS` with appropriate adjustments for data width."
