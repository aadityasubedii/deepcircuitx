Comment: 
The block is a control flow element acting on a rising edge of the clock. It manages the condition and timing for the signal 'wait_done'. If the ninth bit of the reset signal 'rst_i' is asserted, 'wait_done' is set to 1 after a delay defined by the cycle time constant 'TCQ'. 'wait_done' is also set to 1 if the 'push_cmd_r' signal is true. In the case where the command is valid 'cmd_valid_i', the command is ready 'cmd_rdy_o', and the target family is "SPARTAN6", 'wait_done' is set to 0, indicating that the command processing is still ongoing.
