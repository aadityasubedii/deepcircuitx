This block monitors for simultaneous hits in multiple cache ways which should not occur in a proper functioning setup. It is implemented by adding values of data_hit_way for all eight ways (from 0 to 7) and triggering a testbench error message if the sum exceeds 1, indicating hits in more than one cache way.
