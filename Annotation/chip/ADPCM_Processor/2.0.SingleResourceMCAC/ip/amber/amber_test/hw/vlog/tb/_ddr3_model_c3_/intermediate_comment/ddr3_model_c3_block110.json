    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for performing a timing check operation on the 21st bit of the 'dq_in' signal array. This is achieved by continuously monitoring this specific bit for any changes using the 'always' construct in Verilog. Upon any change in this specific bit, the routine 'dq_timing_check' is called with the index '20' as its parameter, indicating the specific bit on which the operation is to be performed."
