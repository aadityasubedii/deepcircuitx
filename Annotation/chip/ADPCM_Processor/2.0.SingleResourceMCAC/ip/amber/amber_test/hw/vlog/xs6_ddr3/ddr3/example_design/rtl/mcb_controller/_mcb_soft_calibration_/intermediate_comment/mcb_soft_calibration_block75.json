    "block_comment": "The block of code responds to a positive edge of UI_CLK and sets the condition for a reset state in a system. The reset state, Rst_condition1, is set to 1 if RstCounter has reached or passed a defined maximum count, TZQINIT_MAXCNT, implying that a reset-ready state is achieved. If this condition isn't met, the reset state remains at 0, indicating no shift to a reset condition."
