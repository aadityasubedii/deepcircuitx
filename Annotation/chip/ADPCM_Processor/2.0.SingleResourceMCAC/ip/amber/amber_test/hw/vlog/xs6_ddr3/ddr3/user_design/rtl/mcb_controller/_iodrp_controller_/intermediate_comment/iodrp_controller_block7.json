    "block_comment": "The block manages a bit counter, which increments on each positive edge of the DRP clock if the system is in either the address phase or data phase and not performing a synchronous reset. The bit count resets to zero in all other conditions such as during a synchronous reset or if the state does not fall under the address phase or data phase."
