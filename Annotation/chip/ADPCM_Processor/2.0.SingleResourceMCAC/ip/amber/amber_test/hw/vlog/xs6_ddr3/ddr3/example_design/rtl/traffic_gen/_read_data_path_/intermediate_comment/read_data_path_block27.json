    "block_comment": "This block of code describes the instantiation of an asynchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) circuit named 'rd_mdata_fifo'. This circuit is used for buffering data with a depth of 32 with transmitted data size defined by the `DWIDTH` parameter on the 'data_i' input signal when the 'data_valid_i' signal is high. The FIFO data is read out on the 'rd_v6_mdata' signal when the 'rd_mdata_en' signal is high. Both write and read processes share the same clock 'clk_i'. Resetting is handled by the 'rst_i[0]' signal. The FIFO's empty status is reported on the 'rd_mdata_fifo_empty' wire."
