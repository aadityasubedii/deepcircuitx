    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a task for displaying the status and values of registers in the Amber Core processing unit. It starts by printing a header with the name of the core, then it presents the current operating mode by evaluating the `status_bits_mode` and indicating the active mode with a `>` symbol. Following this, it sequentially displays the hexadecimal values of the general-purpose registers (r0 to r12) and dedicated registers including the stack pointer (r13), link register (r14), and program counter (r15). Lastly, it displays the current status flags (N, Z, C, V, IRQ Mask, and FIRQ Mask) and the operating mode in a user-friendly format. This task effectively assists in debugging and program flow tracking by providing a comprehensive view of the registers' state at a given instance."
