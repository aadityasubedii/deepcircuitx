    "block_comment": "The block of code is a flip-flop sensitive to the rising edges of reset and clock signals, designed to control the busy reading state. When a reset signal occurs, the 'busy_reading_r' register is cleared, setting the state to not busy. On a clock edge if the output is valid and not in write mode, the 'busy_reading_r' is set, indicating that the system is busy. If valid read data is available, the 'busy_reading_r' reset occurs, implying the read process is complete and the system is no longer busy."
