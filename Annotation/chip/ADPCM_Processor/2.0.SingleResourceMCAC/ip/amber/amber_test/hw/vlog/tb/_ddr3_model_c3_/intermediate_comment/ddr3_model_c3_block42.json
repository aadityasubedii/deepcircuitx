    "block_comment": "This block of code concerns the implementation of a timing check on the DQS (Data Strobe) signal line in a memory interface. Specifically, it calls the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function for the 24th signal line (note that the indexing starts from 0) whenever a falling edge (negative edge transition) is detected on the DQS signal. This check serves to maintain correct data sampling and transfer times, ensuring signal integrity."
