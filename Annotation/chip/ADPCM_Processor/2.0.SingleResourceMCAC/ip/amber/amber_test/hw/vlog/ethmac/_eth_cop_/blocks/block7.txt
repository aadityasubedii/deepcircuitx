This block performs a check to see if a task (`m2`) is in progress and acknowledges data input from two separate sources accordingly. If `m2` is in progress, the logic inside the block is run. It checks whether `m2` is addressed to `s1` or `s2`, and if it is, it assigns their respective acknowledgment and data inputs (`s1_wb_ack_i`, `s1_wb_dat_i`, `s2_wb_ack_i`, `s2_wb_dat_i`) to the outputs (`m2_wb_ack_o`, `m2_wb_dat_o`). If `m2` is not in progress, then it sets the acknowledgment output to 0. This implementation uses if-else conditional statements to map the correct input data to the output based on the task status and addressing.
