The module has a large number of input and output ports that handle Ethernet receive functionality. It processes incoming raw Ethernet data (MRxD), validates it (MRxDV), and then decrypts it into useful segments, like start and end frame signals, byte counts, CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) errors, and state of the transmission. It also manages the detaching of unnecessary parts from the raw data, such as the Preamble and SFD (Start Frame Delimiter). In addition, other inputs control features such as frame length (MaxFL) and Interframe Gap (IFG)."
