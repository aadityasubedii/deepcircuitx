The block of code captures and calculates the end address range for a data transfer operation on every positive edge of the clock signal. A delay of 'TCQ' cycles is incorporated on the 'end_addr_range' signal assignment for synchronization purposes. It performs the calculation by subtracting the product of the 'bl_out_reg' register value and data width (DWIDTH) divided by 8 from 'end_addr_i[15:0]', and then adds 1. The transaction width of this operation corresponds to the DWIDTH bits scaled by 'bl_out_reg', ensuring correctly positioned data transfers.
