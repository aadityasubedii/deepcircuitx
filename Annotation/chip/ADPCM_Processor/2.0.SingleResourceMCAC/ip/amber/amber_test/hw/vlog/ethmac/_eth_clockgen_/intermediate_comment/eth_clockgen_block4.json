    "block_comment": "The provided block of Verilog code is used to manage a clock divider, which can also be reset. The block of code is governed by a positive clock edge or a positive reset signal. If the reset signal is received, then the output Mdc is turned off with a propagation delay defined by Tp. However, if there is no reset signal and the counter (CountEq0) is zero, the output Mdc toggles its state with the same propagation delay."
