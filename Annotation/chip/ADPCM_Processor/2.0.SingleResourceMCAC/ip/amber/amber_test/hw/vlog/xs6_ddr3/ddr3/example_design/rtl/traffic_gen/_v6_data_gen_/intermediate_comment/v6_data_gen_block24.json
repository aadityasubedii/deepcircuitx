    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the data burst scenario in memory where the burst length is eight. The implementation involves shifting sections of the w1data variable, followed by an appropriate re-assignment. Specifically, each \"NUM_DQ_PINS\" sized nibble of the w1data vector is updated by taking sections of the same w1data but offset by 4 bits, merged with the original content for a total shift of 4 bits. This operation is performed on each nibble synchronously with a delay of \"#TCQ\" simulating the clock period of a synchronous DRAM."
