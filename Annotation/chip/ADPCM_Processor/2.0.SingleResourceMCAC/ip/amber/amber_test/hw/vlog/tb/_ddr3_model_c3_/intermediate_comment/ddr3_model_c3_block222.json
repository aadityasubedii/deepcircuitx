    "block_comment": "The function \"get_index\" checks if a given address is already in use. This is accomplished by initializing a \"get_index\" variable to 0 and iteratively scanning through an in-use memory array using a for loop. If a match between the current memory index in use and the input address is found, it sets the \"get_index\" variable to 1, and immediately terminates the loop."
