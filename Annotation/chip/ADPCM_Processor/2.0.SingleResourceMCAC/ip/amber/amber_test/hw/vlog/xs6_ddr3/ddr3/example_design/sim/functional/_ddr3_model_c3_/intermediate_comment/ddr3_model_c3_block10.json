    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for invoking the function `dqs_neg_timing_check(22)` whenever there is a rising edge detected on the input signal `dqs_in[22]`. The block uses an always-statement to constantly monitor changes on the `dqs_in[22]` signal. Once a positive (from low to high) transition is noticed, the function `dqs_neg_timing_check(22)` is called."
