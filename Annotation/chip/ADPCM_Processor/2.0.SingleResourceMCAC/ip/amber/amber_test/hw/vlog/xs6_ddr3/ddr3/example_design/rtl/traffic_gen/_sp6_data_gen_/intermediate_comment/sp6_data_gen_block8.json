    "block_comment": "The block is a conditional check within a generate-construct in Verilog hardware description language. The block checks if the width of the data is 64 bits and if data pattern is either \"DGEN_HAMMER\" or \"DGEN_ALL\". It's designated with label \"HAMMER_PATTERN_64\". If the condition is true, the following constructs would be included in the hardware instance, allowing certain hardware configuration for specific data patterns and width to be generated. This is achieved by utilizing conditional compilation feature provided by the `generate` construct in Verilog."
