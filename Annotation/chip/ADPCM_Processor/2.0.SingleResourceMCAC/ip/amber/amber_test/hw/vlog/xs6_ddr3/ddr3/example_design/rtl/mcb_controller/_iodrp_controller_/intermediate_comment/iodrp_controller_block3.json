    "block_comment": "This block assigns the least significant bit of the `shift_through_reg` array to the `DRP_SDI` variable. The operation is carried out using an `assign` statement, which keeps `DRP_SDI` continuously updated to `shift_through_reg[0]` throughout the code\u2019s operation. This code snippet implements a part of shift register functionality in digital circuits."
