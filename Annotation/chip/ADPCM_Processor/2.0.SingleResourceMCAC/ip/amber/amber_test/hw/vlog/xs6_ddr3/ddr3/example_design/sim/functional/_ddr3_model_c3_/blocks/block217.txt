The function of the provided Verilog block is to erase specified banks from a memory structure. If the MAX_MEM flag is defined, it iterates over all memory banks and closes the file representing the data in a bank if that bank is marked for erasure. The file is then re-opened essentially erasing the data. If the MAX_MEM flag is not defined, the block operates differently. It shifts through all utilized slots in the memory and checks if the bank of the current slot is marked for erasure. If it isn't, it stores that particular slot's address and value into the respective arrays i.e., 'address' and 'memory'. Else, if it is marked for erasure, it will not store this piece of data. Thus, in effect, not copying data equates to erasing. In the end, it prepares the leftover unused slots for future use and adjusts the count of used memory slots accordingly.
