    "block_comment": "This block of code, named 'WR_ONLY_PATH', is designed to ensure that the 'cmp_error' flag is always initialized to false. This is achieved through the 'assign' statement which ensures that 'cmp_error' is given a default value of zero. Therefore, unless there's explicit error detection logic that states otherwise, the 'cmp_error' flag stays in a state of no error. You can find this block of code in the write-only path logic, which implies that it is applicable when only write operations are being performed."
