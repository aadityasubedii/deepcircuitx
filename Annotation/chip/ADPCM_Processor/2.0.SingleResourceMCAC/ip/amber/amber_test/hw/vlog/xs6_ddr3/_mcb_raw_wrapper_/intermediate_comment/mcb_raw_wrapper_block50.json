    "block_comment": "The function of this code block is to initialize the memory interface (mig) control signals and status indicators for both port 0 and port 1 to a default state of 0 ('b0). This involves write and read commands, write and read data, masks, as well as command and data buffers' full, empty, error, underrun, overflow conditions. The implementation involves direct assignments of 0 ('b0) to desired signals, ensuring that they are in their default state. It provides a clean slate before any operation begins, thus making the system reliable."
