    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents an instantiation of a memory unit (`u_mem`). The functionality of the memory unit is primarily determined by the `start_write` signal. If active, the data from the `write_data` input is written to the memory address specified by `address`. If `start_write` is not active, the value at the memory address `address` is read and sent to the `read_data` output. Control signals like clock (`i_wb_clk`), reset (`i_wb_rst`), and byte enable signals (`byte_enable`) are used for synchronization and control over how and when data is read or written."
