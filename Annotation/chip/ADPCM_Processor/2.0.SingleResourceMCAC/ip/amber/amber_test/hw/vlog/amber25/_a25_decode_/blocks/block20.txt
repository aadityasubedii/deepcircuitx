This block of Verilog code manages the control state transition and memory fetch operation. When the control state is in MEM_WAIT1 and there are no conflicts, the signal to fetch the next instruction is enabled. If during this state the instruction is executed, the next instruction address selector is set to value '3', the PC write enable is disabled, and the value of load_pc_nxt is updated to the current value of load_pc_r.
