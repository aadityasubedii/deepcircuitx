    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the valid bits of a cache tag array during the idle state. Whenever there is a rising edge in the clock (i_clk), and if the current state (c_state) equals idle state (CS_IDLE), it adjusts the valid bit register (valid_bits_r) by storing the most significant bits (bit at position TAG_WIDTH-1) of the tag data from each way (tag_rdata_way[7] to tag_rdata_way[0]). By resorting to the sensitivity to the rising clock edge, it ensures that changes in the valid bits are synchronized with the clock cycles."
