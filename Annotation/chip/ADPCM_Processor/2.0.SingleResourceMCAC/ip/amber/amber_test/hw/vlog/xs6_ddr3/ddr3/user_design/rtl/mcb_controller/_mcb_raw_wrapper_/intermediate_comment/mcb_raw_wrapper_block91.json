    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code controls a three-stage pipeline for entering a self-refresh state in a system. If the system undergoes a reset (sys_rst), all pipeline stages are cleared. However, in the absence of a reset signal, the stages are loaded following the positive edge of the ui_clk signal, each following stage taking its value from the previous stage, thus forming the pipeline of entering the self-refresh state."
