This always block manages the negative edge timing check for data queue stream (dqs) input. The function is triggered by utilizing always @(negedge dqs_in[6]), effectively calling the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' procedure every time when a falling edge is experienced at the dqs_in[6]. This is essentially interrupt driven, which helps in event-controlled simulation, making design more efficient by focusing on specific changes (negative edges in this case) on the signal.
