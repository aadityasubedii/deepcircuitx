Comment: 
This Verilog RTL code is used to generate data for writing to a memory location. It becomes active at each positive edge of the input clock signal, 'clk_i'. The data generation is dependent on two control signals, 'fifo_rdy_i' and 'cmd_startC'. If 'sel_w1gen_logic' is active, the block uses the 'addr_i' and 'data_mode_i' inputs to control the generated data. A unique case of data is generated and assigned to 'w1data' based on the 4 upper bits of 'addr_i', with different data for when 'data_mode_i' is 4'b0101 and when it's not. If 'MEM_BURST_LEN' equals 8, a portion of the write data is cyclically shifted. All data assignments are made with a delay of 'TCQ' time units.
