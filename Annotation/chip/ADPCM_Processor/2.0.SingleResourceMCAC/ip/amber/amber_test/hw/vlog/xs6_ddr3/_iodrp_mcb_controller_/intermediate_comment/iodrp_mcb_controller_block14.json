    "block_comment": "This code block is for writing data into memory based on the state of a system. During a positive edge (rising edge) of the DRP clock cycle, if the system state is in the 'READY' condition, the memory cell address is updated with the new 'memcell_address', and the 'data_reg' register is updated with 'write_data'. Additionally, the 'rd_not_write_reg' register is updated with the 'rd_not_write' bit status, indicating whether the operation is for read or write."
