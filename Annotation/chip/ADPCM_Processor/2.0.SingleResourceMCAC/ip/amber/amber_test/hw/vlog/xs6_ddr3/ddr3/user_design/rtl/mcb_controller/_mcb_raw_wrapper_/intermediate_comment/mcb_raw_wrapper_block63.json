    "block_comment": "This block is involved in configuring the memory interface controller (MIG) for a 32-bit databus width configuration (C_PORT_CONFIG[183:160] == \"B32\" && C_PORT_CONFIG[55:32]  == \"W32\"). It sets corresponding signals by checking the fifth port enable signal (C_PORT_ENABLE[4]). If this signal is set, MIG signals like clock, data, mask, and enable are set accordingly, and the status signals like full, empty, under-run, count, and error from the MIG are mapped to the fifth port. When the port is disabled, these MIG signals are set to 0. The port status signals also reflect a null state."
