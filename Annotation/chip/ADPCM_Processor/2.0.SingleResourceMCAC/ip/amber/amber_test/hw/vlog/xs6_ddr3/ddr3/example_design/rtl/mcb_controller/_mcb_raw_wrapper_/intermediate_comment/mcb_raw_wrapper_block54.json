    "block_comment": "This block configures and controls the data read operations of the MIG port 5 based on the port configuration and enable signals. When the configured settings correspond to \"B32\" and \"R32\" and the port is enabled, various control and status signals associated with the reading process are assigned their corresponding values from the MIG port 5. If the port is not enabled, these signals are set to 0. Write-related signals for the same port are always set to 0 within this block, indicating no write operations are performed under this configuration."
