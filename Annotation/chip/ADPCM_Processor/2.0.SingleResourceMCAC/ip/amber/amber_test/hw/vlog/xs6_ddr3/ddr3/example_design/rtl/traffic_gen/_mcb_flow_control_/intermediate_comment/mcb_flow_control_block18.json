    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the readiness of a command FIFO in a hardware context. It achieves this by being sensitive to the positive edge of a clock signal and acts based on different conditions: (1) if the tenth bit of the reset signal is active, it promptly asserts the command FIFO ready flag after a delay of TCQ, (2) if the transfer command is active, it deasserts the command FIFO ready flag after TCQ, and (3) if the MCB command FIFO is not full, it asserts the command FIFO ready flag after a delay of TCQ."
