Comment: 
The block of code depicted is a Verilog task named `wshift`, whose main function is to handle various shifting operations - namely logical shift left (`lsl`), logical shift right (`lsr`), arithmetic shift right (`asr`), rotate right (`ror`), and rotate right with extend (`rrx`). The specific operation to be executed is determined by the `execute_instruction[6:5]` input of the block. The block implements these operations using a case statement to differentiate between the types of shift, writing the corresponding operation type to `decompile_file`. For `rrx` and `ror` operations, they are selected based on the condition if `shift_imm` is zero or not. Moreover, if the operation is not `ror` with `shift_imm` as zero, the block also writes the value of `shift_imm` to the `decompile_file`.
