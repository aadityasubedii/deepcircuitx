    "block_comment": "The block of code connects the signal `c3_error` to `error`, thereby propagating its value. This operation is a commonplace in digital design, often used to forward an internal signal to an output or another part in the design hierarchy. Here, this is achieved through the \"assign\" keyword, which is used for continuous assignments in Verilog."
