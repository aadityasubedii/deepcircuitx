    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily controls the flow of Read operations in a Receive Buffer Descriptor (RxBD). It is designed to run in sync with a Write Back clock (WB_CLK_I) or whenever a Reset is triggered. On a positive edge of either signal, the block checks the current state of various control flags. Initially, if a Reset is detected, the RxBDRead switch is set to 0, indicating no active read operation. If the Reset is not set, the block checks if a Read operation was initiated (StartRxBDRead) and if the system is presently not ready to receive (RxReady flag is cleared), in which case, it sets RxBDRead to 1, thus initiating a Read operation. If the Read operation has ended (RxBDReady), it deactivates the Read operation by setting the RxBDRead switch back to 0."
