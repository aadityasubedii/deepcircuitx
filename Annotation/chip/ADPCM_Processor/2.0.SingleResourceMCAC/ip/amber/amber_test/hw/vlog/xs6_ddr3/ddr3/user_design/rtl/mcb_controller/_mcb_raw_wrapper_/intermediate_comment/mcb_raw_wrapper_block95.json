    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages a control signal, normal_operation_window, in different modes of system operation. On every positive edge of the ui_clk, it first checks whether a system reset (sys_rst) has occurred; if so, it sets normal_operation_window to 1, meaning the system is in normal operating state. Then, if the system is either entering or in self-refresh mode, it sets normal_operation_window to 0, indicating a non-standard operation state. If the system is neither entering nor in self-refresh mode, it sets normal_operation_window back to 1, signifying return to normal operation. If none of these conditions are met, the signal remains unchanged."
