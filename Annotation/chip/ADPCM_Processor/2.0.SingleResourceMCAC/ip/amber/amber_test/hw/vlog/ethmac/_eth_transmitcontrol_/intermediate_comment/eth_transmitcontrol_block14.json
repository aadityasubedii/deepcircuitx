    "block_comment": "This Verilog block serves as a control frame sender, deciding when to send a control frame signal. Upon receiving a positive edge of the MTxClk signal or a reset signal (TxReset), the 'SendingCtrlFrm' flag is modified. If a reset is received, the 'SendingCtrlFrm' flag is set to 0, terminating any ongoing control frame transmission. If a new control frame is prepared to be sent and the 'TxCtrlStartFrm' is active, the 'SendingCtrlFrm' flag is set to 1, initiating the control frame transmission. Finally, if a 'TxDoneIn' signal is received, indicating the transmission of the current frame has completed, the 'SendingCtrlFrm' flag is set back to 0, readying it for the next transmission cycle."
