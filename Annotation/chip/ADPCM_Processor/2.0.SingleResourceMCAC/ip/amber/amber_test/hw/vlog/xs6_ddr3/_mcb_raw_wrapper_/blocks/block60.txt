Comment: 
This Verilog RTL block is involved in data, mask, and status management for a memory interface generator (MIG). It assigns write masks, write data, and read data between local variables and MIG variables, dependent on the bit widths required. Moreover, it also handles whether read enable signals are set based on whether the user interface mode is AXI and the read data availability. Lastly, it mirrors the write/read count, tries to determine if the write queue is empty, and checks for any write errors by flagging either local or MIG errors.
