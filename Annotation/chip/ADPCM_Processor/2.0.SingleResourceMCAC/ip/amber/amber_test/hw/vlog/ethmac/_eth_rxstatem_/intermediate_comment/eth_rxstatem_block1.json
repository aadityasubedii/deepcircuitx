    "block_comment": "This line of code constitutes an assignment operation in a Verilog model. The operation assigns the concatenation of the StateData1 and StateData0 signals to the two least significant bits of the array StateData. Practically, this assignment operation combines the values of StateData1 and StateData0 into a 2-bit value and assigns it to StateData. This is key in maintaining the state of a finite state machine or similar system logic in a compact format."
