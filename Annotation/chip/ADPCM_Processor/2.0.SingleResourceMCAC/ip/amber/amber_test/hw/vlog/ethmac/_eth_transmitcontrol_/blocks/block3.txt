Comment: 
This block is responsible for generating a control signal named 'ControlEnd'. It does so by comparing the lower 6 bits of the 'ByteCnt' value to hexadecimal '22'. If they are equal, the 'ControlEnd' signal will be asserted or set to '1', indicating the end of byte count control operation. If not equal, 'ControlEnd' remains deasserted or '0'. Hence, the block compares specific portions of a byte counter to a set value and generates a control signal based on that comparison.
