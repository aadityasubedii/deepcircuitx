    "block_comment": "The block of code is handling switching phases in a digital logic design, specifically for a DRP (Dynamics Reference Phase) address phase. This happens at every rising edge of the DRP_CLK. If a synchronous reset (`sync_rst`) signal is high, the `AddressPhase` is being reset to zero. Without `sync_rst` being high, if `AddressPhase` is true then it only remains true if the state doesn't equal `ALMOST_READY`. If `AddressPhase` is not true, it is set to true only when the state is `ADDR_PHASE` and `bit_cnt` equals seven."
