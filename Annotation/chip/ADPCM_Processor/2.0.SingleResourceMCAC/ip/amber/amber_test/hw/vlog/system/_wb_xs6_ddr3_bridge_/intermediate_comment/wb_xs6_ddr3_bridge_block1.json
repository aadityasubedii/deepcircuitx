    "block_comment": "This block is used to generate a write acknowledgement signal. It works by checking if a write request has been issued and the write buffer is ready to receive data, which is indicated by its 'write_buf_r' signal being low. If both conditions are met, the write acknowledgement signal 'write_ack' is set otherwise it's unset. This is implemented using an '&&' AND logical operator and a '!' NOT logical operator in conjunction with assignment ('assign') keyword. Note that this operation takes place concurrently and continually."
