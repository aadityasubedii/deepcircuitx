This block implements an I/O interface for a 16-bit memory controller using IODRP2_MCB (Input/Output Data Rate-to-Phase) modules. It configures and connects multiple IODRP2_MCB instances to handle data (DQ), data strobe (DQS), and data mask (DM) signals. The implementation uses a master-slave configuration for each pair of signals, with delay values set for individual pins. The block includes logic for both the upper and lower bytes of the 16-bit interface, handling input/output operations, delay adjustments, and serialization/deserialization of data.
