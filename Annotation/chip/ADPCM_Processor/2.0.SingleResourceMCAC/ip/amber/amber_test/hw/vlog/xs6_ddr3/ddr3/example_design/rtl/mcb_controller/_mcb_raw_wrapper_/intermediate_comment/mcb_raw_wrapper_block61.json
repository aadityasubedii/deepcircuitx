    "block_comment": "This block configures the writing functionality of the Memory Interface Generator (MIG) in a certain condition. If the CONFIG parameters for the ports are 'B32' and 'W32', and MIG port 2 is enabled, the block assigns the corresponding input signals to the respective MIG's write interface signals. However, if MIG port 2 is not enabled, all the MIG write interface signals are assigned 'b0, effectively disabling these signals."
