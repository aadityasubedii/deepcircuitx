    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to continually monitor the state of the 18th bit of the data queue (dq_in) array. This is achieved by using the always @ control statement in Verilog RTL, which allows this particular element of dq_in array to be under constant observation. If there's any change in the state of dq_in[17], the function `dq_timing_check(17)` is invoked, enabling continuous checks for this specific bit for any potential timing issues."
