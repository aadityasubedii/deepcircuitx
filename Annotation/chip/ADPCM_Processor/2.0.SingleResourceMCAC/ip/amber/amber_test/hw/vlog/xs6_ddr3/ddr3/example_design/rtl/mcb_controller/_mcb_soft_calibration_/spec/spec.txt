Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module implements a soft calibration process for memory controller blocks (MCBs), performing input termination calibration and dynamic DQS delay calibration. It takes inputs such as UI_CLK (clock), RST (reset), PLL_LOCK (PLL status), and various MCB signals, while outputting control signals like DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL, SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ, and DQS delay adjustments. The module uses internal signals including STATE (state machine control), P_Term and N_Term (termination values), DQS_DELAY (current DQS delay), and Max_Value (maximum calibration value). It comprises several main blocks: input termination calibration, DQS delay initialization, dynamic calibration, and self-refresh handling. The module implements a state machine to control the calib
