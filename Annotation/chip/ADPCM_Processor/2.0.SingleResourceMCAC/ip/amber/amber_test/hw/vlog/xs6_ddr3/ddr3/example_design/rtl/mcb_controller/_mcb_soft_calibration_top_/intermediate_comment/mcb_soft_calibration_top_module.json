    "module": "Module-level comment: The mcb_soft_calibration_top module performs soft calibration on DDR memory controller blocks, with control provided over various calibration modes via input parameters. It receives synchronization, control and status signals (like UI_CLK, RST, IOCLK, PLL_LOCK) and communicates calibrations states via a wide range of output signals. The module utilizes internal signals to control IO Data Rate Phase (IODRP), and manage ZIO and RZQ states, while conditionally instantiating IOBUF and IODRP2 modules to handle specific tasks. Its operation involves managing the soft calibration process, which is achieved through complex interactions with these signals and modules."
