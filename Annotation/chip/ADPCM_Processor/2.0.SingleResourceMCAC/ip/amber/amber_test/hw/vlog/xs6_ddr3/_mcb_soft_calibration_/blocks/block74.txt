Comment: 
This code block is responsible for incrementing a counter (`pre_sysrst_cnt`) at every rising edge of `UI_CLK` under a specific condition (`STATE == START_DYN_CAL_PRE`). If the condition does not hold true, it resets the counter to zero. In the implementation, an 'always' block is used with `(UI_CLK)` as a sensitivity list to ensure the action happens at every positive edge of the `UI_CLK` clock signal. The condition is checked by an `if` statement, and according to the result, the counter is either incremented or reset.
