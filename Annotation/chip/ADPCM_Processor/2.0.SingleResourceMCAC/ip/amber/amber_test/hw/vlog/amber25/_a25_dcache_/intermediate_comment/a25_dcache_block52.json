    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the memory read address for a certain hardware module. If a reset signal is detected, the read address is reset to 0, ensuring the hardware module starts reading from the beginning of the memory after reset. If a reset signal is not present but a memory read hit signal ('ex_read_hit') is, the code updates the read address with the corresponding input address bit range, determined by the CACHE_ADDR32_MSB to CACHE_ADDR32_LSB constants. This effectively navigates the read address to a desired memory location."
