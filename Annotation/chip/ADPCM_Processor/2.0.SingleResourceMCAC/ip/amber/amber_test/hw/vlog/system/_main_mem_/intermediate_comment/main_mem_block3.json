    "block_comment": "The block of code handles data read operations. In each clock cycle, trigger signals for the read operation are delayed by two clock periods to synchronize the operation with the rest of the system. The series of ternary operators function as a decoder, selecting a 32-bit subset of a 128-bit data array based on the last 2 bits of the address. This efficiently implements data extraction from the 128-bit word based on the given address."
