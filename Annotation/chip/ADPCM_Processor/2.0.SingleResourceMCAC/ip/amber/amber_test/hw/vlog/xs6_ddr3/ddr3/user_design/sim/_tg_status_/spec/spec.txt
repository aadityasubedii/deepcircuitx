Module name: tg_status.

Module specification: The `tg_status` module is designed to monitor and register data error conditions within a system, ignoring subsequent errors until a reset or manual error clear input is received. The inputs to this module include the system clock (`clk_i`), reset signal (`rst_i`), manual error clear (`manual_clear_error`), data error (`data_error_i`), comparison data (`cmp_data_i`), read data (`rd_data_i`), comparison address (`cmp_addr_i`), comparison block length (`cmp_bl_i`), and Memory Buffer Full or Empty Read conditions (`mcb_cmd_full_i`, `mcb_wr_full_i`, `mcb_rd_empty_i`). The module outputs an error status signal (`error_status`) which stores details of the data error when one occurs, and an error flag (`error`) indicating when an error is stored. Internally, it maintains a register (`data_error_r`) to track the state of the data_error input signal from the last clock cycle and a flag (`error_set`) to denote if an error has been registered or not. The module operates synchronously with the system clock, checking and responding to changes in its inputs upon each clock pulse. During operation, if a data error is detected and no previous error is stored, the module records the current comparison data, read data, comparison address, block length, and buffer statuses into the `error_status` register, and sets `error_set` high. If a reset or a manual clear error signal is received, the stored error status and the `error_set` are cleared. All this functionality is encapsulated within the always blocks that operate upon clock edge and determine the behavior of the internal signals and output based on the current inputs and the state of the internal registers.
