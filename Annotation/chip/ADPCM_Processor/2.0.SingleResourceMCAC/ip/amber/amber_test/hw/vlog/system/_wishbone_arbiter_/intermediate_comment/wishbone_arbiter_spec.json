    "spec": "Module name: wishbone_arbiter. \n\nModule specification: The module \"wishbone_arbiter\" acts as the design for a hardware arbiter in a Wishbone interconnection architecture. It manages the control signals between various masters and slaves. The arbiter routes the request from a specific master to a selected slave and ensures only one master can access a slave at a given time. Parameters `WB_DWIDTH` and `WB_SWIDTH` define data width and selection width respectively. The module also handles read from/write to operations based on the current master and current slave. The selection of both the current master and slave is done based on the `i_wb_clk` signal and the address range of various devices. Error and acknowledgment signals are managed through the arbiter.\n\nMaster input signals start with 'i_m' followed by the master number and signal type (adr for address, sel for selection, we for read/write, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe). Slave input signals start with 'i_s' followed by the slave number and signal type (dat for data, ack for acknowledgment, and err for error).\n\nMaster output signals start with 'o_m' followed by the master number and the signal type (dat for data, ack for acknowledgment, and err for error). Slave output signals start with 'o_s' followed by the slave number and the type of signal (adr for address, sel for selection, we for write enable, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe). \n\nInternally, signals starting with 'm' holds the state of each master, while signals `current_master` and `next_master` indicate the current and next master in line for accessing slaves. The `current_slave` signal selects the current slave. Signals `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`, `master_cyc`, and `master_stb` control the data transactions between current master and current slave. Signals `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, and `master_err` indicate the data read from the slave, successful operation, and error encountered respectively. \n\nIn this module, `current_master` gets selected based on the clock cycle. Based on the selected master and address input, the `current_slave` is determined using a series of if conditions. Corresponding to each master-slave pair, different sets of assign statements are written to manage the data transfer by enabling certain signals, such as address, write enable, cycle signal, and strobe. The received data, acknowledgment, and error signals from the slave are generated for the master. The module ends with the assignment of acknowledgment, error, and data signals from the slave to the master. Overall, this module ensures efficient multi-master and multi-slave communication within the Wishbone interconnection architecture.",

Explanation: The module \"wishbone_arbiter\" acts as the design for a hardware arbiter in a Wishbone interconnection architecture. It is responsible for managing the control signals between various masters and slaves. A master can be a CPU or a DMA controller while a slave can be memory or a peripheral device. The arbiter helps in routing the request from a specific master to a selected slave and ensures that only one master can access a slave at any given time. Parameters WB_DWIDTH and WB_SWIDTH define data width and selection width respectively. The module also handles the read from/write to operations based on the current master and current slave. The selection of both the current master and slave is done based on the i_wb_clk signal and the address range of various devices.

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput Ports:  \n1. i_wb_clk: The clock signal for the module.\n2. i_m0_wb_adr and i_m1_wb_adr: Master 0 and master 1 address input ports.\n3. i_m0_wb_sel and i_m1_wb_sel: Selection signals for master 0 and master 1.\n4. i_m0_wb_we and i_m1_wb_we: Write enable signals for Master 0 and master 1.\n5. i_m0_wb_dat and i_m1_wb_dat: Data input ports for master 0 and master 1.\n6. i_m0_wb_cyc and i_m1_wb_cyc: Cycle signals for master 0 and master 1.\n7. i_m0_wb_stb and i_m1_wb_stb: Strobe signals indicating the valid data address for master 0 and master 1.\n8. i_s0_wb_dat to i_s7_wb_dat: Slave data input ports from slave 0 to slave 7.\n9. i_s0_wb_ack to i_s7_wb_ack: Acknowledgement signals from slave 0 to slave 7 of a successful read/write operation.\n10. i_s2_wb_err to i_s7_wb_err: Error signals from slave 0 to slave 7, indicating an error encountered during operation.\n\nExplanation: \nInput ports represent different data or control signals received by the module. The clock signal i_wb_clk is the main timing signal. The master signals start with 'i_m' followed by the master number and the signal type (adr for address, sel for selection, we for read/write, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe). Similarly, the slave signals start with 'i_s' followed by the slave number and the type of the signal (dat for data, ack for acknowledgment, and err for error).\n\nOutput Ports: \n1. o_m0_wb_dat and o_m1_wb_dat: Data output ports for master 0 and master 1.\n2. o_m0_wb_ack and o_m1_wb_ack: Acknowledgement signals to master 0 and master 1 of a successful read/write operation.\n3. o_m0_wb_err and o_m1_wb_err: Error signals to master 0 and master 1, indicating an error encountered during operation.\n4. o_s0_wb_adr to o_s7_wb_adr: Address output ports for slave 0 to slave 7.\n5. o_s0_wb_sel to o_s7_wb_sel: Selection signals for slave 0 to slave 7.\n6. o_s0_wb_we to o_s7_wb_we: Write enable signals for slave 0 to slave 7.\n7. o_s0_wb_dat to o_s7_wb_dat: Data output ports for slave 0 to slave 7.\n8. o_s0_wb_cyc to o_s7_wb_cyc: Cycle signals for slave 0 to slave 7.\n9. o_s0_wb_stb to o_s7_wb_stb: Strobe signals indicating the valid data address for slave 0 to slave 7.\n\nExplanation: \nOutput ports represent different data or control signals sent out by the module. The master output signal starts with 'o_m' followed by the master number and the signal type (dat for data, ack for acknowledgment, and err for error). The slave output signals start with 'o_s' followed by the slave number and the type of the signal (adr for address, sel for selection, we for write enable, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe). These signals control the interaction between this arbiter module and master and slave modules in the system."

The signals 'm0_wb_hold_r' and 'm1_wb_hold_r' are used to prevent the respective masters from sending more requests until their previous request is acknowledged. The 'current_master' and 'current_master_r' signals hold information about the currently active master, while 'next_master' prepares for the next master in queue. The 'select_master' signal helps in this selection. Based on the current master and the address input, the 'current_slave' is determined. The 'master_adr', 'master_sel', 'master_we', 'master_wdat', 'master_cyc', and 'master_stb' signals are used to initiate and control the data transfer between the current master and the current slave. The 'master_rdat', 'master_ack', and 'master_err' signals are responses from the slaves to the master indicating the data read, successful operation, and error encountered respectively."

It manages the control signals between various masters and slaves. The arbiter routes the request from a specific master to a selected slave and ensures only one master can access a slave at a given time. Parameters `WB_DWIDTH` and `WB_SWIDTH` define data width and selection width respectively. The module also handles read from/write to operations based on the current master and current slave. The selection of both the current master and slave is done based on the `i_wb_clk` signal and the address range of various devices. Error and acknowledgment signals are managed through the arbiter.\n\nMaster input signals start with 'i_m' followed by the master number and signal type (adr for address, sel for selection, we for read/write, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe). Slave input signals start with 'i_s' followed by the slave number and signal type (dat for data, ack for acknowledgment, and err for error).\n\nMaster output signals start with 'o_m' followed by the master number and the signal type (dat for data, ack for acknowledgment, and err for error). Slave output signals start with 'o_s' followed by the slave number and the type of signal (adr for address, sel for selection, we for write enable, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe). \n\nInternally, signals starting with 'm' holds the state of each master, while signals `current_master` and `next_master` indicate the current and next master in line for accessing slaves. The `current_slave` signal selects the current slave. Signals `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`, `master_cyc`, and `master_stb` control the data transactions between current master and current slave. Signals `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, and `master_err` indicate the data read from the slave, successful operation, and error encountered respectively. \n\nIn this module, `current_master` gets selected based on the clock cycle. Based on the selected master and address input, the `current_slave` is determined using a series of if conditions. Corresponding to each master-slave pair, different sets of assign statements are written to manage the data transfer by enabling certain signals, such as address, write enable, cycle signal, and strobe. The received data, acknowledgment, and error signals from the slave are generated for the master. The module ends with the assignment of acknowledgment, error, and data signals from the slave to the master. Overall, this module ensures efficient multi-master and multi-slave communication within the Wishbone interconnection architecture."

The clock signal i_wb_clk is the main timing signal. The master signals start with 'i_m' followed by the master number and the signal type (adr for address, sel for selection, we for read/write, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe).

The signals 'm0_wb_hold_r' and 'm1_wb_hold_r' are used to prevent the respective masters from sending more requests until their previous request is acknowledged. The 'current_master' and 'current_master_r' signals hold information about the currently active master, while 'next_master' prepares for the next master in queue. The 'select_master' signal helps in this selection. Based on the current master and the address input, the 'current_slave' is determined. The 'master_adr', 'master_sel', 'master_we', 'master_wdat', 'master_cyc', and 'master_stb' signals are used to initiate and control the data transfer between the current master and the current slave. The 'master_rdat', 'master_ack', and 'master_err' signals are responses from the slaves to the master indicating the data read, successful operation, and error encountered respectively."

                    "text": "Module name: wishbone_arbiter. \n\nModule specification: The module \"wishbone_arbiter\" acts as the design for a hardware arbiter in a Wishbone interconnection architecture. It manages the control signals between various masters and slaves. The arbiter routes the request from a specific master to a selected slave and ensures only one master can access a slave at a given time. Parameters `WB_DWIDTH` and `WB_SWIDTH` define data width and selection width respectively. The module also handles read from/write to operations based on the current master and current slave. The selection of both the current master and slave is done based on the `i_wb_clk` signal and the address range of various devices. Error and acknowledgment signals are managed through the arbiter.\n\nMaster input signals start with 'i_m' followed by the master number and signal type (adr for address, sel for selection, we for read/write, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe). Slave input signals start with 'i_s' followed by the slave number and signal type (dat for data, ack for acknowledgment, and err for error).\n\nMaster output signals start with 'o_m' followed by the master number and the signal type (dat for data, ack for acknowledgment, and err for error). Slave output signals start with 'o_s' followed by the slave number and the type of signal (adr for address, sel for selection, we for write enable, dat for data, cyc for cycle, and stb for strobe). \n\nInternally, signals starting with 'm' holds the state of each master, while signals `current_master` and `next_master` indicate the current and next master in line for accessing slaves. The `current_slave` signal selects the current slave. Signals `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`, `master_cyc`, and `master_stb` control the data transactions between current master and current slave. Signals `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, and `master_err` indicate the data read from the slave, successful operation, and error encountered respectively. \n\nIn this module, `current_master` gets selected based on the clock cycle. Based on the selected master and address input, the `current_slave` is determined using a series of if conditions. Corresponding to each master-slave pair, different sets of assign statements are written to manage the data transfer by enabling certain signals, such as address, write enable, cycle signal, and strobe. The received data, acknowledgment, and error signals from the slave are generated for the master. The module ends with the assignment of acknowledgment, error, and data signals from the slave to the master. Overall, this module ensures efficient multi-master and multi-slave communication within the Wishbone interconnection architecture."
