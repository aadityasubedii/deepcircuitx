This block of Verilog code is responsible for managing a two-stage synchronizer for transmitting start frame signals (`TxStartFrm_syncb2`), which are clocked by `WB_CLK_I`. The synchronizer is resettable, and when the `Reset` signal is high, it sets the `TxStartFrm_syncb2` to 0. If the `Reset` is not active, the block simply transfers the previous `TxStartFrm_syncb1` to `TxStartFrm_syncb2`. The synchronizer aims to reduce the chance of metastability of the `TxStartFrm_syncb2` by introducing `Tp` delay.
