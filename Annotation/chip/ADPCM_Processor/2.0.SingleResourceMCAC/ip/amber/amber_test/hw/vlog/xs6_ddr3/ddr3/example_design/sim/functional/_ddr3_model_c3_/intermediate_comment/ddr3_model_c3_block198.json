    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a flip flop that triggers on the positive edge of the dqs_even[10] signal. The implemented functionality is the method dqs_even_receiver with the input '10'. The state change of this flip flop is controlled by the 10th index of the dqs_even vector. When the 10th bit of this vector goes from '0' to '1' (positive edge), the dqs_even_receiver function will be invoked."
