This block of code is primarily intended for memory controller board (MCB) software calibration. The procedure includes an if condition that checks if the 'C_CALIB_SOFT_IP' is true to start the calibration process. Within the if condition, an instance 'mcb_soft_calibration_top_inst' of the module 'mcb_soft_calibration_top' gets called with specified parameters for clock rates, reset, I/O clock rates, calibration, and PLL lock among others. The purpose of this block is achieved through the use of the MCB software calibration top module, that communicates with various inputs and outputs such as UI_CLK, RST, IOCLK, etc to manage the calibration process. MCB also manipulates various signals during this process, like UIDRPUPDATE, UICMDEN, UIDONECAL etc. The calibration process ends when the DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL signal is pushed. Control, command, and status signals all get set and used within this block, providing a comprehensive approach to manage the memory controller board's software calibration.
