Comment: 
This block of code generates and latches a pulse signal reflecting the current mode state. The signal generation is triggered by the positive edge of the input clock(`clk_i`). Before assigning the `mode_load_pulse` to the block level register `mode_load_pulse_r1`, the code introduces a delay modeled by `#TCQ` to simulate register clock-to-q delay. The updated value of `mode_load_pulse` is latched at the rising edge of the clock and held steady for the remainder of the clock cycle.
