Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for monitoring the 8th bit (denoted by [7]) of the 'dq_in' signal. Whenever this particular bit changes (either from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0), the always@ block gets triggered. The associated function 'dq_timing_check' with an argument of '7' is called each time this happens, which can be utilized for timing checks or other specific functions dependent upon this signal bit transition event.
