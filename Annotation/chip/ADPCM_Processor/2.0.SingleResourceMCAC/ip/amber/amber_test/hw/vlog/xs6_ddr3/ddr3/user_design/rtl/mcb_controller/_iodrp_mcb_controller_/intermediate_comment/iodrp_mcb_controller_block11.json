    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manipulates the output data signal 'data_out' based on the 'drp_ioi_addr' input. The 'data_out' is routed to 'data_out_mux' with possible left-shift operations for signal manipulation or amplification. This is done through a case statement wherein each case corresponds to a unique 'drp_ioi_addr' value. Depending on this value, 'data_out' could remain same, be left-shifted by one, or passed through a 'shift_n_expand' function. Further, a macro preprocessor conditional directive 'ifdef' is used, which specifies that if 'DRP_v1_0_FIX' is defined, certain cases will have 'data_out' left-shifted once before being assigned to 'data_out_mux'."
