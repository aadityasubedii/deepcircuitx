Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: The memc_wrapper module is a comprehensive memory controller interface wrapper designed to manage interactions between user ports and external DDR memory. It supports multiple ports (p0-p5) with command, write, and read interfaces, as well as AXI interfaces (s0-s5). The module handles various input signals including clocks, resets, and control signals, and provides output signals for memory addressing, control, and data transfer. Key input ports include sysclk_2x, pll_ce_0, async_rst, and multiple port-specific signals for command, write, and read operations. Output ports encompass memory interface signals like mcbx_dram_addr, mcbx_dram_ba, and status indicators such as calib_done. Internal signals are used for configuration, calibration, and status reporting, including C_MC_CALIBRATION_CLK
