Comment: 
The block of code is a procedural block triggered on the positive edge of the 16th element in the `dqs_in` array. It executes a function `dqs_neg_timing_check()` with parameter 16. This function likely confirms the correct timing of the 16th bit in the `dqs_in` data queue. The trigger condition indicates that this check is performed whenever there's a logical high transition, or positive edge, on the 16th bit of the `dqs_in` array.
