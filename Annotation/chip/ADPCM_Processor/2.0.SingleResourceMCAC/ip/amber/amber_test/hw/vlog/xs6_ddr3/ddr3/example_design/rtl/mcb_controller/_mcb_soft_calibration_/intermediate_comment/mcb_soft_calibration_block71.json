    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is tasked with managing memory self-refreshing modes and PLL lock status, under certain clock or reset conditions. At the rising edge of either UI_CLK or RST, the block reacts differently. When RST is high, it sets all the SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE, SELFREFRESH_REQ, and PLL_LOCK related signals to '0', effectively disabling self-refresh requests and indicating no PLL lock. Conversely, should the system not be in reset, this block cyclically updates these registers, passing current status to the next in a chained, 3-stage pipeline each clock cycle. This pipelining invigorates system performance by concurrently processing multiple operations."
