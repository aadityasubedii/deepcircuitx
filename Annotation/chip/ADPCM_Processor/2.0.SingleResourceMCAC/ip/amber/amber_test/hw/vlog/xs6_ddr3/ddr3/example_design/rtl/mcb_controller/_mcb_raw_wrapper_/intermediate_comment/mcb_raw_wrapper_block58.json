    "block_comment": "This block is primarily responsible for managing the assignment of various hardware ports and signals related to the reading functionality of memory interface generator (MIG) in a specific configuration. An evaluation of the C_PORT_CONFIG register checks if it matches with the \"B32\" and \"R32\" configuration. If this condition and the C_PORT_ENABLE[3] are true, the MIG port signals like clk, rd_data, and rd_en are directly assigned from those of P3 port signals. In addition to these, overflow, error, full, empty, and count signals also get assigned. Else, in case C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is not true, the MIG clock is simply assigned a value of zero, leaving other values unmodified, effectively disabling the MIG reading mechanism."
