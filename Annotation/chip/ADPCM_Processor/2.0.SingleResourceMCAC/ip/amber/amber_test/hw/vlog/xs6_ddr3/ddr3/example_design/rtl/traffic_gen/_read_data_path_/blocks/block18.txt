This block is responsible for enabling comparison data processing based on certain triggering conditions. This operation is implemented using an always block in Verilog which is sensitive to the positive edge of the input clock (clk_i), suggesting the operation happens at every clock cycle. The comparison data readiness (cmp_data_en) is then set with a predefined time delay defined by TCQ after the data is prepared, indicated by data_rdy. This solves the synchronization issues in digital circuits.
