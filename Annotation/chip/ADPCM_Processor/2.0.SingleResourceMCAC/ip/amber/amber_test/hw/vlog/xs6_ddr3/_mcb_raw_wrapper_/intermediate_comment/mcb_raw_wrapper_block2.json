    "block_comment": "This block of code dynamically configures the pull up and pull down of the ultra data queue strobe (UDQS) based on the memory type and the number of data queue (DQ) pins. If the memory type is DDR, MDDR, or DDR2 (with differential DQS disabled) and the number of DQ pins are 16, a pull down operation on the UDQS signal is performed. For all other memory configurations with 16 DQ pins, both pull up and pull down operations are performed on the UDQS and its complement (UDQS_N) signals respectively."
