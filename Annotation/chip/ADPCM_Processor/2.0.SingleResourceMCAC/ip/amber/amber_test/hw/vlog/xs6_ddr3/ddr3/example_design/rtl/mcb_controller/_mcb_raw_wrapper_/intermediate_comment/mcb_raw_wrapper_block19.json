    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the OSERDES2 instance `ioi_ldm_0` and configures the datapath for data serialization. The Output Serializer (OSERDES) in Master mode serializes parallel data inputs (`dqplm`, `dqnlm`) into a serialized output (`ldm_oq`). Unused data input shifts (`SHIFTOUTX`), data inputs (`DX`), training, and output buffers for tristate signals (`TX`) are set to logical '0'. The clock signal `ioclk90` is used for data output, with the system reset signal `int_sys_rst` defined for reset functionality. In addition, the tristate buffer control input is driven by `dqIO_w_en_0`. The clock enable signals for output logic and data output are permanently enabled by declaring `OCE` and `TCE` as logic '1'. The module's instantiation is done using specified parameters."
