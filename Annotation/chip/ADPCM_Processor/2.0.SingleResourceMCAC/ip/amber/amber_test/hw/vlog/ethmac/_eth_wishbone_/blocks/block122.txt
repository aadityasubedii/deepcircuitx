Comment: 
This block of code handles the completion of access operations from a master device. It does so by implementing a logical OR operation on the acknowledgment signal (m_wb_ack_i) and the error signal (m_wb_err_i) and assigns the result to the `MasterAccessFinished` signal. This indicates that an operation has finished either successfully (acknowledgment) or with an error condition.
