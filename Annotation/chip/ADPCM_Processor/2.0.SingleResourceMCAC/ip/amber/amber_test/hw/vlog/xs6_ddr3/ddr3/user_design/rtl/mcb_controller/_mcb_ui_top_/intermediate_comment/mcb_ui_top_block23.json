    "block_comment": "This block configures the Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper, essential in defining the fundamental memory element's specifications. It manages the memory timing, layout, addressing, user interface, the number of Data Query (DQ) pins, read-write operations, calibration values and the functioning during simulation. It also handles specific characteristics for various memory types (DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, etc.) and employs calibration techniques for fine-tuning the read and write paths on MCB. It also establishes mask sizes and data port sizes for memory ports P0 and P1. All the parameters are user-defined constants, making the block highly configurable according to specific system requirement."
