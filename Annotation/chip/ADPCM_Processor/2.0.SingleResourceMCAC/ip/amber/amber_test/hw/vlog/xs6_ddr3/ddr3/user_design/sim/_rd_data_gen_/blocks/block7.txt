This block is used to generate the signal 'last_word_o', which indicates if the last word in stream has been accessed and is ready for processing. It is implemented by using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog, which creates a continuous assignment. The signal 'last_word_o' is generated by logically ANDing the signals 'u_bcount_2' and 'data_rdy_i', in order to ensure both conditions are met. The 'u_bcount_2' signal indicates whether or not the last word in the stream has been accessed, and 'data_rdy_i' signal indicates whether or not the data is ready to be processed.
