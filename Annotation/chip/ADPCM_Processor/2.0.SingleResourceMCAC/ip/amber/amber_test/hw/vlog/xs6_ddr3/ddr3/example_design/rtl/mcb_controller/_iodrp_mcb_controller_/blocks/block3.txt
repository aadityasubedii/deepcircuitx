Comment: 
This block's function is a conditional assignment of values to the DRP_SDI signal based on other signal states. This block achieves its function by using a ternary operator line of code, which evaluates based on the conditions: if 'rd_not_write_reg' AND 'DRP_CS' are high, and 'DRP_ADD' is low, then assign the value of 'DRP_SDO' to 'DRP_SDI', else the 'DRP_SDI' retains its previous value ('DRP_SDI_pre').
