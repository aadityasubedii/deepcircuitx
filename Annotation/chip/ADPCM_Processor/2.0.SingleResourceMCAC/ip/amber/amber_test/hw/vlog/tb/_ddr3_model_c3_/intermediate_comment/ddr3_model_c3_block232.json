    "block_comment": "This code block defines a tri-state signal `tdqs_n` in Verilog. The function of the block is to denote a bus of High-Impedance (Z-state) signals whose width is equal to the constant DQS_BITS. The command \"assign\" is used to continuously drive `tdqs_n` with the constructed High-Impedance bus. The construct `{DQS_BITS{1'bz}}` generates a bus signal where all bits are 'z' (High-Impedance state) and its size will be the value defined by DQS_BITS. The underscore \"n\" at the end of the signal name typically signifies that this signal is active low, it's a common naming convention in hardware designs."
