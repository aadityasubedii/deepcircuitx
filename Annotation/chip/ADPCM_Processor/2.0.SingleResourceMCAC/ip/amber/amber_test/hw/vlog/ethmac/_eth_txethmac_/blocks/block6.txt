Comment: 
The block is used to indicate the completion of a packet transmitting sequence. This event is flagged when any one of six different conditions is met: transmission start completion, excessive packet size, underrun, late collision, occurrence of maximum collisions, or excessive deferment event. The `assign` construct is used for the concurrent evaluation of these conditions each clock cycle with a logical OR operator, and the composite result is assigned to the `PacketFinished_d` signal.
