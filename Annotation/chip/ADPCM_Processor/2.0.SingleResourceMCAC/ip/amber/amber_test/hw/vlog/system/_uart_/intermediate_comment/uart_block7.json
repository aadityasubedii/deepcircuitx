    "block_comment": "The block handles the signaling of an interrupt in a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) system; specifically for the receiving (rx) side. On every positive edge of the input clock, the interrupt signal, `rx_interrupt`, is captured and saved to `uart0_rx_int_d1`. If an interrupt is signaled in the current cycle that wasn't present in the last (rising edge), a debug message reporting the interrupt is printed, detailing the current status of fifo-enable, whether the receiver fifo is full, half or more than half its size, the interrupt timer and the count of the fifo. Conversely, if the interrupt was signaled in the last cycle but isn't in the current one (falling edge), it logs that the interrupt condition has been cleared and reports the same details."
