    "block_comment": "This code block assigns a force write command variable to an output signal. The output, `force_wrcmd_gen_o`, gets its value from `force_wrcmd_gen`. This is a simple wire assignment in Verilog, and it immediately copies the value of `force_wrcmd_gen` to `force_wrcmd_gen_o` in every single clock cycle. This process is crucial for maintaining signal continuity in synchronous hardware designs and for passing flags or signals in a digital system from one module to another."
