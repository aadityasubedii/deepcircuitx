    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for invoking the `dqs_odd_receiver` function upon the rising edge of `dqs_odd[10]`. It relies on an `always` block which in Verilog specifies combinational logic. In this case, the logic reacts every time there is a positive edge transition (from low to high) in the 10th bit of the `dqs_odd` array. This would be typically used in the context of handling some type of data reception or synchronization where the signal `dqs_odd[10]` serves as a clock or a flag to handle incoming data."
