    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for triggering the digital circuit 'dqs_odd_receiver' on every positive edge of the 16th bit of 'dqs_odd'. Achieving this function relies on the hardware description language's (Verilog) sensitivity list feature. The 'always' keyword is used in conjunction with the '@' sign to denote an event-driven or sensitive process. Hence, whenever there's a positive edge detected on 'dqs_odd' at index 15, it triggers the 'dqs_odd_receiver' circuit."
