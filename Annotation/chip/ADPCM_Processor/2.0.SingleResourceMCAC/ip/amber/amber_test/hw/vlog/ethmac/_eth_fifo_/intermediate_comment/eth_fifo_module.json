    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'eth_fifo' module enables FIFO operations on ethernet data with parameterizable depth and width. It uses input signals (data_in, clk, reset, write, read, clear) for control operations and output signals (data_out, almost_full, full, almost_empty, empty, cnt) to provide data and status updates. Internally, a 2D fifo array holds the data, while 'cnt', 'read_pointer' and 'write_pointer' signals aid in tracking and managing data. Depending on the hardware, it may use distributed FPGA memory. The module also utilizes delay gates to simulate propagation delays."
