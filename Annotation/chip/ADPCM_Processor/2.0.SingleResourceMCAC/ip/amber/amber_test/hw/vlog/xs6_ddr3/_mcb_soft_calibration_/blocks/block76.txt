The block of code manages a reset condition. At every positive edge of the user interface clock (UI_CLK), the code checks if the `RstCounter` value is greater or equal to the maximum count `TZQINIT_MAXCNT`. If true, it sets the `Rst_condition1` to 1 indicating a reset condition; if false, `Rst_condition1` is set to 0.
