    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is a task for checking memory timing violations. It does this by verifying specific time delay conditions concerning data mask (DM) bits and data strobe (DQS) bits, and will print an error message if any violation occurs. The code checks if the difference between the current simulation time and the time of the last DM or DQS bit is less than a pre-defined limit (TDH for DQS, TDIPW for DM bit). If the condition fails, an error message is printed with the details of the violation. The task also resets the check_dm_tdipw array to zero for the next bit and updates the time marker tm_dm for the current DM bit."
