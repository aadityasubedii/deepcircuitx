This block of code serves as a counter. It's implemented as a synchronous process that triggers on the positive edge of UI_CLK. When RST_reg is high, the `count` is reset to 0. If `counter_en` is high and RST_reg is not active, the `count` is incremented by 1 on each cycle, otherwise it resets to 0.
