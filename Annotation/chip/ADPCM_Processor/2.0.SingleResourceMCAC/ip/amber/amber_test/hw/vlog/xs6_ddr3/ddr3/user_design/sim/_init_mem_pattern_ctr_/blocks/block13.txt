Comment: 
The block monitors the system clock and sets the `end_addr_reached` flag based on given conditions. It checks if `upper_end_matched` and `lower_end_matched` are true for specific family types (SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6), along with proper data widths (32, 64, or 128). If these conditions are met, `end_addr_reached` is set to '1' indicating the end address has been reached, otherwise it's reset to '0'.
