    "block_comment": "The specified block initializes a function (dqs_pos_timing_check) that performs a positive edge detection on the 13th bit of the `dqs_in` input array at every system timestep. This function is executed every time a transition from low to high voltage level is detected on the 13th bit of the array, allowing for time-specific actions to be carried out."
