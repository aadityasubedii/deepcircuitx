Module name: ddr3. Module specification: The ddr3 module is a DDR3 memory controller interface designed for FPGA-based systems requiring high-bandwidth memory access. It instantiates infrastructure and memory controller wrapper submodules to handle DDR3 SDRAM operations. The module features configurable parameters for memory timings, sizes, and interfaces, supporting multiple command, write, and read ports (p0-p5) for interacting with DDR3 memory. Key input ports include DDR3 data bus (mcb3_dram_dq), system clock (c3_sys_clk), reset (c3_sys_rst_i), and various command, write, and read interface signals for each port. Output ports comprise DDR3 address and control signals, clock signals, and status signals for each port. Internal signals handle clock management, reset control, and additional memory port interfaces. The
