    "block_comment": "This block performs the function of generating specific data patterns based on the number of Data Query (DQ) pins and the selected data pattern. If there are 72 DQ pins and the pattern is set to \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\", the block will generate the corresponding pattern. A conditional evaluation is performed at the beginning of the block checking for these conditions. The pattern generation is executed at the positive edge of the input clock signal, ensuring it operates in sync with the entire system's timing."
