    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to control a particular signal in a synchronous system. It triggers on the positive edge of the clock input (`clk_i`). When `user_burst_cnt` equals two and `data_rdy_i` is available (`data_rdy_i = 1`), indicating that the system is ready to process data, it sets the signal `next_count_is_one` to high (`1'b1`) after a delay defined by the parameter `TCQ`. Otherwise, it sets the signal `next_count_is_one` to low (`1'b0`) after the same delay."
