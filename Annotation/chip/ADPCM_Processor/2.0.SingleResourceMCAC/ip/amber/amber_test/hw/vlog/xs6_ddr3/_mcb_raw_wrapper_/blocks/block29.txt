Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is a serial data transmitter for the bank addresses. It generates a series of Output Serializer-Deserializer 2 (OSERDES2) modules in a bounded loop, where the loop variable is the bank address width. Each iteration configures an OSERDES2 module with fixed parameters to tightly control the data rate, output mode, and serialization mode. The instantiated OSERDES2 takes the current bank address bit as input and produces deserialized outputs, which are driven by a clock signal and a system reset signal. It also ensures that the addresses are clocked out simultaneously by disregarding any input data after the first two stages. The operation is initiated when the phase-locked loop control signal is enabled.
