This block of code is responsible for managing state transitions in a Finite-State Machine (FSM) related to clock termination. Specifically, it implements a wait state (LDQS_CLK_P_TERM_WAIT) where the system waits for the MCB (Memory Control Block) to become available (MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is false). If the MCB is already available, the state machine advances to the next state (LDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM). The decision to transition is based on the system's MCB status, ensuring synchronization with memory operations.
