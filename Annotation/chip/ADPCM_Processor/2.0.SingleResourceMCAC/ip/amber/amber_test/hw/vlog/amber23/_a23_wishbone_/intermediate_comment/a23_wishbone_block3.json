    "block_comment": "This block represents a state display mechanism for a Wishbone protocol. It uses conditional operator logic to map the `wishbone_st` signal to human-readable state names, offering quicker debugging and better understanding of the system state at any given time. The block assigns a specific string according to each different possible 'wishbone_st' state condition, and if none of these conditions is matched, an 'UNKNOWN' string is assigned to `xAS_STATE`, revealing that the Wishbone protocol is in an undefined state."
