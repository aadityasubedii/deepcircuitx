Comment: 
This block of code forms part of a finite state machine (FSM) and handles the transition between states, particularly the UDQS_WAIT1 and UDQS_WRITE_NEG_INDELAY states. If the memory controller (MCB) is busy (MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is false), the current state remains UDQS_WAIT1; otherwise, the FSM transitions to the UDQS_WRITE_NEG_INDELAY state.
