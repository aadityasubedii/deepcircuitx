    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs the updating of register values based on specific conditions. On every positive edge of the `i_clk` signal, if `i_fetch_stall` is not triggered, the registers (r0 to r15, and their variations) are updated. The first set of register (r0 to r7) is directly updated with input `i_reg` if corresponding `i_reg_bank_wen` signals are asserted. For the rest, the updates to the registers (r8 to r14 and their special cases) are contingent on conditions where `i_reg_bank_wen[x]` state and `!firq_idec`, `firq_idec`, `usr_idec`, `svc_idec`, `irq_idec` conditions are met. The last register r15 is updated with `i_pc` if the `i_pc_wen` signal asserts. This mechanism ensures that each register is updated at appropriate times, depending on the input control signals and their state conditions."
