    "block_comment": "This block generates error byte signals based on comparison results and data validity for VIRTEX6 family with a burst length of 8. This is achieved by iterating over half of the data query pins, with an increment of 1 at each pass. For each index \"i\", if the incoming data \"data_i\" is valid and mismatches with the comparison data \"cmp_data\" at specific positions (8*(i+1)-1:8*i), the \"error_byte\" signal at index \"i\" is asserted."
