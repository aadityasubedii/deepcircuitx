    "block_comment": "This block primarily handles the operation of stopping specific read and write operations within a memory system in Verilog, while also managing memory stall. On every positive edge of the `reset` or `clk` signals, the block checks for certain stall conditions and accordingly sets the flags `uncached_wb_stop_r`, `cached_wb_stop_r`, `mem_stall_r`, `daddress_valid_stop_r`. In the presence of a reset signal, all flags are reset to zero. Under normal operation, these flags are set by logical operations based on different signals like `uncached_data_access_p` for uncached writeback operations, `cached_wb_req` for cached writeback, `daddress_valid_p` for valid data address read/write operations, as well as signals of instruction fetch stall and memory output stall. These flags aid in managing the memory read-write operations under stall conditions.\n"
