    "block_comment": "The block of code is a primary memory (main_mem) instantiation in a hardware design. It implements functionality for reading and writing data to and from a Wishbone-compliant memory system. The memory address (i_wb_adr), select lines (i_wb_sel), write enable (i_wb_we), input data (i_wb_dat), cycle line (i_wb_cyc), and strobe (i_wb_stb) serve as inputs while the output data (o_wb_dat), acknowledgment (o_wb_ack), and error signals (o_wb_err) serve as outputs. There is also a clock input (i_clk) and a separate input for memory control (i_mem_ctrl), and a signal 'phy_init_done' assigned to 1, indicating the completion of physical initialization."
