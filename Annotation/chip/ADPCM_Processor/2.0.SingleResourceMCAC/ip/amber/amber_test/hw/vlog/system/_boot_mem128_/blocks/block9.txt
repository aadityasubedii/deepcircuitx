Comment: 
This block initiates a pseudo-random number generator using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) design. Functioning as a clocked sequential logic block, it activates on the rising edge of the Writeback-stage (`i_wb_clk`). The least significant bits from the `jitter_r` register shifts as bitwise defined and a new bit comes in at the most significant register bit. The new bit is found by applying XOR logic to the 8th, 5th, and 2nd bits of 'jitter_r'.
