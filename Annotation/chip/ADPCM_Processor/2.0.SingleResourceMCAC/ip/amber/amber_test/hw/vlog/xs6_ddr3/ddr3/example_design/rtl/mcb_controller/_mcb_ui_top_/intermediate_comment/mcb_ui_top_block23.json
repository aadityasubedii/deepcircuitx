    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for interfacing the different components of a Memory Controller Block (MCB), with signals for clocking, control, read and write operations, and error handling functionalities. It has a highly flexible design that encapsulates command, read and write operations for six different ports (p0 to p5). These instructions manage the execution, access, and data transfer within each port. It also directs the communication with the embedded DRAM through signals such as MCBx_dram_addr, MCBx_dram_ba, MCBx_dram_ras_n, and MCBx_dram_we_n among others. The block also includes signals related to calibration and self-refresh functionalities of the memory system."
