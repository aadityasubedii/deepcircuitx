    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to calculate the available buffer space in a FIFO memory scheme. It determines the buffer's availability by subtracting the writing pointer (\"wr_ptr\") from the summation of the read capture pointer (\"rd_capture_ptr\") and the buffer's full depth (\"FIFO_DEPTH\")."
