    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for data generation based on certain input conditions. The operations are executed at the positive edge of the 'clk_i' clock signal, indicating this is a sequential process. If the 'fifo_rdy_i' is enabled or if 'cmd_startC' is true, the block starts its operations. If the selector for 'w1gen_logic' is triggered, the block maps the input address bits ('addr_i') to a specific data generator function - 'Data_Gen' or 'Data_GenW0', depending on the 'data_mode_i' input - to assign values to 'w1data' variable with a 'TCQ' delay. This conditional assignment and the usage of 'case', imply this block also provides a kind of decoding functionality."
