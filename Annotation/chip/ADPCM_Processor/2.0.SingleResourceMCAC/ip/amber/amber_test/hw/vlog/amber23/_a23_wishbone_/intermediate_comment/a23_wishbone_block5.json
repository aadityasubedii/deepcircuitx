    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles a wait state for a Write Acknowledge signal in a Wishbone bus protocol. It does this by implementing a logical AND operation on Write Strobe (o_wb_stb) and Write Enable (o_wb_we) signals, then logical AND NOT operation with the complement of the Write Acknowledge (i_wb_ack) signal."
