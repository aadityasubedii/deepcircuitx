    "module": "Module-level comment: This module decodes ARM instructions for an A25 processor core. It implements a complex state machine to handle various instruction types, interrupts, and pipeline stages. The module generates control signals for the execution stage, manages register selection, ALU operations, and memory accesses. It uses multiple internal signals and combinational logic to decode instructions, handle pipeline conflicts, and control the processor's execution flow."
