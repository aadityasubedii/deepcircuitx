    "block_comment": "This block serves as a hardware functional unit, enabling or disabling a series of AXI signals depending on the status of C_S5_AXI_ENABLE. If C_S5_AXI_ENABLE is disabled (0), the unit assigns incoming signals such as p5_arb_en, p5_cmd_clk, p5_cmd_en etc. to corresponding \"p5\" prefixed processes. These processes include a variety of operations such as clock signal switching, command instruction execution, read/write operations. The mapping ensures proper interfacing and signal flow for the system when the AXI bus is deactivated."
