This block of code is a simple bus pipe that forwards certain Wishbone signals from input to output. It receives data, select signals, and read data from the Wishbone interface and passes them directly to the appropriate output. This simple copying mechanism is achieved using three assignment operations, which ensure that the input values for write data, select signals, and read data are reflected at the corresponding output.
