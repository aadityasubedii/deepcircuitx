    "block_comment": "This block of code instantiates a BUFGCE primitive which is a clock buffer with a clock enable (CE) feature in Xilinx FPGAs. It takes an input clock signal (mcb_drp_clk_bufg_in) and a control signal (locked), and outputs a clock (mcb_drp_clk). The control signal is used to enable or disable this clock output depending on if the system design is locked or not. If 'locked' is HIGH, the input clock signal will pass through to the output clock signal, else the output will be disabled."
