    "block_comment": "This block is used for configuration, specifically enabling direct registers access when the AXI interface is disabled. When the macro `C_S5_AXI_ENABLE` is set to `0`, all the input assignments are directly connected to their corresponding internal signals (`p5_arb_en`, `p5_cmd_clk`, `p5_cmd_en`, etc.) without any intermediate computation or function, implying a direct pass-through configuration mode. This block serves a crucial role as part of a larger AXI module, allowing for seamless control over read and write operations, and error and overflow status signaling."
