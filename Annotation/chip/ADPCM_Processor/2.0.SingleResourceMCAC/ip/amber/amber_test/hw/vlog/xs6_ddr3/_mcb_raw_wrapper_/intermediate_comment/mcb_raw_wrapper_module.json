    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper for DDR/DDR2/DDR3 memory interfaces. It manages physical layer communication between FPGA and external memory, handling address, data, and control signals. The module uses IODRP2 blocks for I/O configuration, supports multiple ports with configurable data widths, and includes calibration logic. It implements clock management, data serialization/deserialization, and supports various memory types and configurations through parameterization."
