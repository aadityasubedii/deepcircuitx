    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `priviledged_update` based on the negation of `i_core_stall`. In other words, whenever `i_core_stall` is not set (value 0), the `priviledged_update` is enabled (value 1). This implementation provides a mechanism to control updates based on the stall signal of the core module in the design."
