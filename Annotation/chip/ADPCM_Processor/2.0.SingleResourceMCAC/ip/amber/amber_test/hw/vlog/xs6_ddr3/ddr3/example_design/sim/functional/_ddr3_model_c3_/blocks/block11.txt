Comment: 
This block of code sets up an event-triggered procedure in the design. Whenever there is a positive edge detected on the 22nd bit of the signal 'dqs_in', it calls the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' with parameter 21. The function is most likely used to test or monitor the timing characteristics of the negative edge of a data strobe signal in DDR memory interfaces.
