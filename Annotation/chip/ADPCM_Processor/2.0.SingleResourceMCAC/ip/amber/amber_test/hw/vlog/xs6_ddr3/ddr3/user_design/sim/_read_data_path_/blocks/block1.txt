Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code performs an assignment operation. It assigns the current state of the `data_error` (usually derived from other logic or registers in the RTL code) to the output port (`data_error_o`). This essentially gives external modules or hardware access to the `data_error` state. The assignment takes place continuously in hardware, as denoted by the `assign` keyword. The state of `data_error_o` gets updated whenever the state of `data_error` changes.
