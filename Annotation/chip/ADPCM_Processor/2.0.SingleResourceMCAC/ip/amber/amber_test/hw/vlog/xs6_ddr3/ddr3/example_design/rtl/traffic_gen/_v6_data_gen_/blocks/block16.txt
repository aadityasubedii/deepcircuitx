This block handles the shifting of data for a memory burst length of 8 in a volatile memory interaction. The code achieves this function by slicing the w1data vector based on the defined size of NUM_DQ_PINS constant and using non-blocking assignments with a delay of TCQ time units to shift the segmented data in each range. The shift operation is carried out for each quarter of the full-range of the w1data vector.
