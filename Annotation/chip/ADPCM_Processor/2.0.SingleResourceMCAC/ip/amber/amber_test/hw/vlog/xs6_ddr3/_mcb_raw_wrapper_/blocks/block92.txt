This block of Verilog code is used for error detection in write only ports. The block is active at all times ('always @(*)'). If a command is detected on 'C_PORT_CONFIG' at bits 87 through 64 where the command string is "W32", and 'p3_cmd_en' is enabled, but the command 'p3_cmd_instr' is not formatted correctly (third bit 0 and first bit 1), then an error message is displayed stating "ERROR - Invalid command for write only port 3", and the simulation is halted ('$finish').
