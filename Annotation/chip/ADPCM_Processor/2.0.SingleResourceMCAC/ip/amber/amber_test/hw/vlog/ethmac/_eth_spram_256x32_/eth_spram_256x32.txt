Module-level comment: The eth_spram_256x32 module represents a single port RAM controller with byte-enable support, with a capacity of 256 addresses, each holding 32-bit data. It manages memory operations using control parameters such as 'clk', 'rst', 'ce', 'we', 'oe', 'addr', and 'di' as inputs, and emits 'do' as the 32-bit output data. The internal signal 'write_enable' helps coordinate write operations. It supports three types of FPGA: Xilinx Spartan6, Virtex6, and generic, specified by a defined parameter.
