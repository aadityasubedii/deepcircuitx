    "block_comment": "This block is for saving and pre-fetching instructions based on certain conditions in a pipelined processor design. On the rising edge of `i_clk`, if `i_fetch_stall` isn't high, the block checks the `itype`. If `itype` equals `MTRANS`, the block captures the specific micro-transaction instruction details and stores them in the relevant `saved_` variables. However, if `itype` doesn't equal `MTRANS` but `saved_current_instruction_wen` is high, it saves the regular instruction details likewise. Independently, if `pre_fetch_instruction_wen` is high, it pre-fetches the next instruction and saves those details into `pre_fetch_` variables."
