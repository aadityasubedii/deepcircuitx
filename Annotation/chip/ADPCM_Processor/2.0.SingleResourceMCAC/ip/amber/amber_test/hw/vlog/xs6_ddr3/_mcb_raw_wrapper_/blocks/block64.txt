This block handles both the read and write operations error management, overflow detection, underflow detection, checking write empty and full states, and finally provides stub functionality for command handling on a data interface with multiple (P0 to P4) paths. The block assigns each path with corresponding condition checks. The error, overflow, and underflow states for read and write operations are tracked using respective registers. It also monitors whether the data write operations are either empty or full for each path, providing insights into the queue status. Simultaneously, it assigns stubs for the 'p4' path command empty and full states. The block ends by zeroing out the write mask for "mig_p2" and "mig_p4", effectively disabling them.
