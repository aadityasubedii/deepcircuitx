This block of code is responsible for data writing operations in memory. The writing operation is carried out at each rising edge of the input clock, regulated by the 'start_write' signal. The writing mask is selected based on the addressed memory chunk segments. The input data is also prepared in a replicated format to the writing variable. In the second part, a conditional addressing logic is deployed, depending upon the 'i_mem_ctrl' command signal. The addressed memory is written with masked data when the 'wr_en' signal goes high. Debugging provisions are included to display the write operations with the timestamp, address, data, and byte enable sequence.
