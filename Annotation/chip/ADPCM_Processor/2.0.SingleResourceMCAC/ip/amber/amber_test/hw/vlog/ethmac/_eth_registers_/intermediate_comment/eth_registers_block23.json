    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is primarily built for managing the status of the SetTxCIrq_sync1 signal in synchronization with a system clock (Clk) or a given reset signal (Reset). The block gets activated at the rising edge (positive edge) of the system clock or the Reset signal. If the Reset signal is high, the SetTxCIrq_sync1 signal is instantaneously set to zero with a delay introduced through Tp parameter. If the Reset signal is not high (i.e., low), the status of SetTxCIrq_sync1 is made equivalent to SetTxCIrq_txclk with the same delay. This essentially synchronizes the SetTxCIrq_sync1 signal state with the SetTxCIrq_txclk signal or resets it based on the system's condition."
