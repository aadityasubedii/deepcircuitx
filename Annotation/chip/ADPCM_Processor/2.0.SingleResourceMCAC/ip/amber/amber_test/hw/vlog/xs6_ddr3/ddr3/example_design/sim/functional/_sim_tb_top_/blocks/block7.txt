Comment: 
This block of code generates a system clock signal, named `c3_sys_clk` in the Verilog RTL design. It uses an `always` block to continuously toggle the value of `c3_sys_clk` by inverting its state (`~c3_sys_clk`) at a time delay equal to half of the `C3_MEMCLK_PERIOD`. This creates a clock signal with a period equal to `C3_MEMCLK_PERIOD`, achieving regular and predictable timing necessary for digital circuit synchronization.
