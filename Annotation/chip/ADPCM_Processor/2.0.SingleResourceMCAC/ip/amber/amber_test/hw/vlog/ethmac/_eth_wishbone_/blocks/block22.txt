Comment: 
This block manages the synchronous clearing and updating process of RxAbortSync4 signal. The update/reset mechanism is triggered with the positive edges of either WB_CLK_I or Reset. If the Reset signal is active, the RxAbortSync4 signal is asynchronously updated to be 0, leading to the immediate termination of any ongoing reception. If not, the prevailing value of RxAbortSync3 is transferred to RxAbortSync4, providing a one-clock-delay to the propagation of RxAbortSync3's value.
