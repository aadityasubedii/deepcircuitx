    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of the logical AND operation between 'u_bcount_2' and 'data_rdy_i' to 'last_word_o'. This operation helps indicate that the last word in a data sequence is ready. This is achieved through the use of the AND operation in Verilog, which returns a high output (last word is ready) only if both 'u_bcount_2' and 'data_rdy_i' signals are high."
