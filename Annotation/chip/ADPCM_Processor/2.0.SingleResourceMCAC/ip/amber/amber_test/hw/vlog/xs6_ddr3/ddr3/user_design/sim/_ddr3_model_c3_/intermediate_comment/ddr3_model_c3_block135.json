    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates an event-driven function `dm_timing_check` in Verilog whenever there is a change in `dm_in[12]` signal. The function, `dm_timing_check(12)`, is a user-defined procedure, presumably used for checking timing properties of digital signals. The `always @` means this is a sensitivity list, and the block will be evaluated whenever there is a change on `dm_in[12]` due to this event-driven behaviour."
