Comment: 
This block of code generates a delayed clock signal. It achieves this through the use of an always block that assigns a delay of BUS_DELAY units to the input clock signal 'ck' and assigns the delayed signal to 'ck_in'. This effectively creates a new clock signal 'ck_in' that is a delayed version of the original 'ck' signal.
