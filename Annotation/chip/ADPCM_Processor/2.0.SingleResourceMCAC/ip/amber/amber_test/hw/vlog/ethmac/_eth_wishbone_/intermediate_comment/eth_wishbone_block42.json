    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for controlling the state of the WriteRxDataToFifoSync1 signal, which is used to write received data into a FIFO buffer. If a positively triggered reset signal or a WriteRxDataToFifo instruction is detected on the positive edge of the WB_CLK_I signal, the value of WriteRxDataToFifoSync1 is assigned accordingly. If the Reset signal is high, WriteRxDataToFifoSync1 is set to the binary value of 0, thus disabling data write into the FIFO. On the other hand, if WriteRxDataToFifo is high, WriteRxDataToFifoSync1 gets set to the binary value of 1, allowing data write. For all other conditions, WriteRxDataToFifoSync1 is set back to 0, confirming that the FIFO write remains inactive."
