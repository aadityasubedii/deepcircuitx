    "block_comment": "The block of code implements read data selection for a three-way set associative cache. It functions by checking each cache line, in order, to see if the desired data is present. If the data is found in the first cache line (`data_hit_way[0]`), it assigns the corresponding data (`data_rdata_way[0]`) to `hit_rdata`. If not, it checks the next cache line and repeats the process. If the data is not in any cache line, it assigns the default value to `hit_rdata` which is `CACHE_LINE_WIDTH` number of 1's."
