    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for assignment operation in Verilog. It assigns the value of `wdp_validC` to `wdp_validC_o`. This simple operation is made in continuous assignment statement form which means it continuously checks for changes in the `wdp_validC` value and immediately assigns any new value to `wdp_validC_o`. This one-line code effectively relates two variables ensuring their values are always identical by propagating any changes in the input to the output."
