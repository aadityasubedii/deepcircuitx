    "block_comment": "This conditional block plays a role in pattern generation, specifically when the number of Data Query (DQ) pins is equal to 80 and the data pattern is either \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\". It utilizes the 'if' statement for its operation, triggering specific behavior depending on the data pattern available. The block name 'WALKING_ONE_80_PATTERN' implies it's used for a particular design scenario dealing with high pin count and data movement."
