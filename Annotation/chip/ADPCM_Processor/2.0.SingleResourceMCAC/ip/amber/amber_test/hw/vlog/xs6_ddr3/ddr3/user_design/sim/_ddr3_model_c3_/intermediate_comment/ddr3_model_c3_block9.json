    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for triggering a function named 'dqs_neg_timing_check(23)' when a rising edge is detected on the 23rd bit of the 'dqs_in' signal. Specifically, the keyword 'always' sets up a situation where the function is continuously monitored and the '@(posedge dqs_in[23])' statement specifies that the function call is event-driven, responding to a positive edge transition of the 'dqs_in[23]' signal. This mechanism ensures that the 'dqs_neg_timing_check(23)' function is promptly executed whenever 'dqs_in[23]' transitions from a low to high state."
