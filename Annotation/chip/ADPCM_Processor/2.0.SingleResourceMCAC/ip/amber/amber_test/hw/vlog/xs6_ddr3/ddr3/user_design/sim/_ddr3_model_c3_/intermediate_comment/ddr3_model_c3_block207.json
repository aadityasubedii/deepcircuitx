    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for detecting the positive edge of the dqs_even signal. This is accomplished by setting up an always block that operates on the positive edge of the second bit of dqs_even signal array, which then calls the dqs_even_receiver function with the parameter 1 when this event occurs."
