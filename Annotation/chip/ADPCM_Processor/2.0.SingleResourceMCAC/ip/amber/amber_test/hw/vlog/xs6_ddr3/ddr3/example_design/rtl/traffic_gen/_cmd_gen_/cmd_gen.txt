Module-level comment: This module generates memory interface commands (read, write, refresh) with associated addresses and burst lengths. It supports various modes including fixed, sequential, and PRBS patterns for address and instruction generation. The module uses configurable inputs to determine operation modes, generates addresses and instructions based on selected patterns, manages burst lengths, and outputs valid commands while respecting buffer availability and timing constraints. It includes PRBS generators, address counters, and control logic to handle different FPGA families and memory interface widths.
