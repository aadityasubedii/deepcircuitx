    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for assigning the 'load_rd_c' value based on the 'i_wb_read_data_valid' condition. If 'i_wb_read_data_valid' is true, it selects certain bits from 'i_wb_load_rd' (bits 6 to 5 and 3 to 0, in that order) and assigns these to 'load_rd_c'. If it's not true, 'load_rd_c' takes the old value 'load_rd_r'. This conditional assignment is how the block accomplishes its function."
