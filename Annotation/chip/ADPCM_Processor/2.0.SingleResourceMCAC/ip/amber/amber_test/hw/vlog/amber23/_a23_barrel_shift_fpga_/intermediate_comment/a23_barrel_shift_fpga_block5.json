    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for assigning values to specific parts of the `asr_out` signal based on certain conditions. Firstly, if the 32nd bit of `i_in` signal is true or 1, this value gets assigned to the first bit of `asr_out` signal, otherwise, it takes value from the result of logical AND operation between 32nd bit of `p_r` and `lsr_mask` signals. The second part of `asr_out` signal assignment also works similarly, where it checks two conditions (`shift_over` and `shift_nzero`). For the condition where `shift_over` is true, `i_in` 32nd bit is assigned to `asr_out` second bit. If `shift_over` is false, then it checks `shift_nzero` condition. If `shift_nzero` is true, it assigns 32nd bit `p_r` to `asr_out`, failing which it assigns `i_carry_in`."
