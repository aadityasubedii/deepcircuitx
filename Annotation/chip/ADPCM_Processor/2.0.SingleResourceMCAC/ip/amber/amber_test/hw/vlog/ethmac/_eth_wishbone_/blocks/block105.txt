Comment: 
This block of code is used for signal assignments related to Receiver (Rx) status signals. The first line assigns the 14th bit of the RxStatus_s signal to the RxIRQEn signal, which is usually used for enabling the interrupt of the receiver. The second line assigns the 13th bit of the RxStatus_s signal to the WrapRxStatusBit signal, which can typically be used to indicate a wrap-around status in a circular buffer scenario in the receiver's data processing logic. Both signals rely on bit-specific assignments from the RxStatus_s signal for their values.
