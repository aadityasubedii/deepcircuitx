This block of code performs parameter checking in a hardware design. Specifically, it verifies whether the DATA_WIDTH is set to 21 and the ADDRESS_WIDTH is set to 8 at the beginning of the simulation. If any of these parameters are not set to their expected values, the block generates a warning message, indicating the specific parameter that has been incorrectly set.
