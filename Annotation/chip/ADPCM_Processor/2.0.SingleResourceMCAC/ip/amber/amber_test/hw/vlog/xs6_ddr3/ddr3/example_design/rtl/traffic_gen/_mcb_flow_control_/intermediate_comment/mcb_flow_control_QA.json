The module is focused around a state machine (READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, REFRESH_ST) that handles transitions for various commands related to memory operations (Read, Write, Refresh and others). \n\nTransitions occur on rising edge of a clock signal, and various outputs are set/updated based on the current state. There are parts of the module that handle memory read, write, waiting, refresh, and other command operations. Inputs to the module include command validity, command type, address, burst length, memory full signal, and memory ready signals. \n\nOutputs include readiness of command, command type, data address, burst length, and different memory-valid signals indicating different parts of data word have been written. The module has additional handling for SPARTAN6 family. \n\nIt uses a set of registers to store local state, addresses, command type, and for sending to other parts of the system. Registers are synchronous and are updated on a rising clock edge. They are enabled by various conditions relating to the current state of the system and input signals. Wire connections are used to connect logical components, and assign statements are used to define combinational logic. Several inline comments indicate that this module is sensitive to timing considerations especially with SPARTAN6 family FPGAs."
