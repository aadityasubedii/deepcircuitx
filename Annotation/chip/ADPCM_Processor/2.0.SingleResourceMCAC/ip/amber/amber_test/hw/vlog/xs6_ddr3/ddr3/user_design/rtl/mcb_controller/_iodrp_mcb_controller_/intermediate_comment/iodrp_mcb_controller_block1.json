    "block_comment": "This block of code performs sequential state transition in a finite state machine. In response to the positive edge trigger of DRP_CLK, it decides between two states, READY or the nextstate, relying on the 'sync_rst' signal. If 'sync_rst' is high, it forces the state to be READY, otherwise, it switches to 'nextstate', allowing transitions between different states based on the FSM design."
