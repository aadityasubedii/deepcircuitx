This block of Verilog RTL code manages the end control of a transmitter operation. The block listens for a positive edge trigger on either the MTxClk or TxReset signals. When the TxReset is active, the transmitter control end frame (TxCtrlEndFrm) gets cleared to prepare for a new transmission sequence. In contrast, if either the ControlEnd or ControlEnd_q flags are set, the TxCtrlEndFrm is set to indicate the end of a control frame. If not in a reset condition or end of control, TxCtrlEndFrm resets to ensure it's ready for the next control trigger. The block employs delays (#Tp) sync with system timing requirements.
