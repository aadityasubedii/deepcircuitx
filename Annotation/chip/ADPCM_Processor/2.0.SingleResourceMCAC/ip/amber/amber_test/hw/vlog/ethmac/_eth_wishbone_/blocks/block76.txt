This Verilog code block manages the state of the `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync2` signal, based on the system clock (`WB_CLK_I`) or a reset condition. Upon a positive edge of reset or clock signal, the block checks the `Reset` condition. If 'Reset' is high, the `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync2` signal is set to 0 with some propagation delay defined by `Tp`. In all other cases, the signal is set to the value of `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync1`, again with the `Tp` delay.
