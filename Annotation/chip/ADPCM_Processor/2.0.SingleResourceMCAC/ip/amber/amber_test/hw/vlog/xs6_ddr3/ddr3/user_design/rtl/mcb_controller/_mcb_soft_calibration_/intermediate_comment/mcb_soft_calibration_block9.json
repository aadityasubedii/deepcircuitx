    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to control the enable state of a waiting counter (`WaitCountEnable`) based on various conditions. The implementation is such that on a rising edge of `UI_CLK`, if `RST` is high, `WaitCountEnable` is disabled (set to 0). If `SELFREFRESH_REQ_R1` is high and `SELFREFRESH_REQ_R2` is low, `WaitCountEnable` is again disabled. In contrast, if there is a positive edge on `PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH` (going from low to high) while `PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH_R1` is low, `WaitCountEnable` is enabled (set to 1). In all other cases, the `WaitCountEnable` maintains its previous state."
