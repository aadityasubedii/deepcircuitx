    "block_comment": "This block of code manages memory addresses in a write or read process based on the input signals. If the 'rst_i' reset signal is active, the current_address is reset to a preset BEGIN_ADDRESS. Moreover, the current_address is incremented by a specific count (INC_COUNTS) when a 'mcb_wr_en_i' write enable signal is on and the current state is either initializing the memory write (under 'WR_MODE' or 'BI_MODE') or in an idle state under 'RD_MODE'. In all other scenarios, the current_address stays the same.\n"
