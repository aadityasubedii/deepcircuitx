    "block_comment": "This block of code declares and assigns values to two wire elements: \"write_hit\" and \"write_miss\". These elements represent write operation statuses within a cache memory architecture designed with Verilog. \"write_hit\" is used to indicate successful data writing when the enable signal, write request signal, and cache hit signal are all ON. Meanwhile, \"write_miss\" implies a cache miss event under active enable and write request signals, and when the cache state is different from the \"CS_WRITE_HIT1\" state; it implies unsuccessful data writing due to a missing required address in the cache. This subsequent write miss is to be handled by further logic not represented in this particular block."
