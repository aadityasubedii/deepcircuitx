    "block_comment": "This block of code is for error handling in a control state execution context. It operates during the positive edge of the input clock cycles. If the control state is currently in EXECUTION mode and the first or last bit of the instruction are undefined ('x'), it triggers the pre-defined test bench error message macro and displays the erroneous instruction in hexadecimal format."
