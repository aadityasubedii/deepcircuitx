    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code appears to generate a bit-walking sequence of a specific pattern for a setup with 88 data query (DQ) pins. Depending on the value of the DATA_PATTERN (which could be \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\" or \"DGEN_ALL\"), it starts the walking sequence on a clock's positive edge. It allows tracking and observing the responses on the 88 DQ_PINS to specific data pattern such as neighbouring pins or walking '1' or '0', for testing or validation activities."
