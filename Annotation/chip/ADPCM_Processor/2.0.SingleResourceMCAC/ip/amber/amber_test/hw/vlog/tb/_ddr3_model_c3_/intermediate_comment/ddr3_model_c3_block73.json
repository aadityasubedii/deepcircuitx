    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a real-time monitoring function that invokes the dq_timing_check function whenever there's a change detected at bit 57 of dq_in signal. The described block employs event-driven programming particular to hardware description languages. This type of system ensures that the system promptly reacts to changes and minimizes idle run-time during simulation. It uses an 'always' construct that will trigger the named function, dq_timing_check, with the bit index 57 as an argument, anytime there's a change in the state of the 57th bit of signal dq_in."
