    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for controlling a divide-by-two function based on conditions. Using flip-flops, the block reacts to the positive edges of the MRxClk or the RxReset. When the RxReset input is true, the Divider2 output is reset to 0. If not, and a bitwise OR operation between a 16-bit slice of PauseTimer and RxFlow yields a non-zero result, Divider2's current state is inverted. However, if neither condition is met, Divider2 will be reset to 0. Here, the #Tp is used to delay the execution of the assignment operation, simulating the propagation delay in hardware."
