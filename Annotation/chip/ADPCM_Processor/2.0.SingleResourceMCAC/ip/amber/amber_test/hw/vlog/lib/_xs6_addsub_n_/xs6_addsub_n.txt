Module-level comment: The Verilog module 'xs6_addsub_n' is a width-parameterizable addition/subtraction module. The operations are performed using a DSP48A1 block with mode defined by 'opmode'. It takes 'i_a', 'i_b' as operands and 'i_cin' for carry input, and a mode flag 'i_sub' to decide between addition or subtraction operations, producing 'o_sum' and 'o_co' as result and carry output respectively. The operands are extended to meet DSP48A1's input width requirements. The block works in sync with the global clock and is configured with synchronous reset type.
