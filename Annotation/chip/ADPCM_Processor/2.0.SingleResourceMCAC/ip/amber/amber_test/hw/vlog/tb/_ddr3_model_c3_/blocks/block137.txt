This block continuously monitors changes in dm_in[10] and initiates a call to the dm_timing_check method with the integer 10 as a parameter. It uses the keyword always and @(dm_in[10]), ensuring enforcement everytime there is a change in dm_in[10]. This block essentially offers a dynamic timing check feature for dm_in[10] in the code.
