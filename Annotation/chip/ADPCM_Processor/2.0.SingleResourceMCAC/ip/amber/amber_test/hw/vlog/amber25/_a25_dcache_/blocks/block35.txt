Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code is used for generating a signal to indicate a read miss event in a cache memory system. The `read_miss` gets assigned when there's a held request (`request_hold`), the cache is not in the idle and hit state (`!idle_hit`) and the write-enable input signal is inactive (`!i_write_enable`). This configuration makes sure that a read miss signal is generated when the cache system is unable to find the requested data and is not in the write mode.
