    "block_comment": "This block functions as a control block for the transmission enable (TxEn) signal in a data transmission system. Upon a rising edge of WB_CLK_I or a positive Reset signal, the block determines the next state of TxEn_needed based on a series of conditions. If Reset is active, TxEn_needed is set to 0 with a delay of Tp units. In the absence of Reset, if the conditions of the data transmission and write buffers are met, namely, ~TxBDReady & r_TxEn & WbEn & ~WbEn_Q, TxEn_needed is set to 1, else if conditions concerning the transmission pointer read, TxEn and previous state of TxEn are met, TxEn_needed is set back to 0, all changes have a delay equivalent to Tp units."
