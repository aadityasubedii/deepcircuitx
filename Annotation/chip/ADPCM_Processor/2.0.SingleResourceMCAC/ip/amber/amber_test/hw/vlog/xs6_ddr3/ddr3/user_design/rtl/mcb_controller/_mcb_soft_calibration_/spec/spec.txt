Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a Memory Controller Block (MCB), handling initialization, termination calibration, and dynamic calibration of DQS signals. It receives inputs such as UI_CLK (input clock), RST (reset), PLL_LOCK (PLL lock status), and various MCB and IODRP signals. The module outputs calibration control signals, including DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL (calibration completion), SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ (self-refresh request), and numerous MCB control signals. Internally, it uses signals like STATE (current calibration state), P_Term and N_Term (termination values), and DQS_DELAY (DQS delay value) to manage the calibration process. The module implements a state machine that progresses through various stages, including RZQ/
