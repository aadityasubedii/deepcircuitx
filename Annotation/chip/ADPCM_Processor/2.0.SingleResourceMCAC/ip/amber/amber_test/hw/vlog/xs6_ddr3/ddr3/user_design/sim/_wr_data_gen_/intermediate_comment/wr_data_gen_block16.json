    "block_comment": "The block of code manages data write termination processes in a synchronous design, specifically related to a FIFO buffer and a user defined a bursting sequence. It's triggered at the rising edge of the input clock, checking several conditions, such as the user burst counter equals to 2 or when a command start is signaled simultaneously with single beat burst length and the family is VIRTEX6, and that the FIFO is not full. If these conditions are met, it sends a high signal '1' after a delay defined by the Timing Control Queue(TCQ) to the data write end output (data_wr_end_o). Otherwise, it sends a low signal '0' to the data write end output."
