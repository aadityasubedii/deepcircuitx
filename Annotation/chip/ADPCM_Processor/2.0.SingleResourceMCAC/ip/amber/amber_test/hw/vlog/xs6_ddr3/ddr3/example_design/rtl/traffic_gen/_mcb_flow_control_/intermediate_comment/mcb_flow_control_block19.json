    "block_comment": "The block of code implements a sequential logic circuit, specifically for regulating the 'cmd_en_r1' signal based on a given set of conditions. On receiving a positive edge clock signal, the code block first checks if the 9th bit of the 'rst_i' signal is high. If it is, it disables the 'cmd_en_r1' command enabling signal. If the 'rst_i' is not high, it then checks if the 'xfer_cmd' signal is active. A high 'xfer_cmd' signal leads to the command enabling signal 'cmd_en_r1' being set to high. If neither 'rst_i' is high nor 'xfer_cmd' is active, it then checks if the signal 'mcb_cmd_full' is not set. If it isn't, the command enabling signal 'cmd_en_r1' is set to low. The '#TCQ' command presumably introduces a delay based on a pre-defined Clock Quality factor."
