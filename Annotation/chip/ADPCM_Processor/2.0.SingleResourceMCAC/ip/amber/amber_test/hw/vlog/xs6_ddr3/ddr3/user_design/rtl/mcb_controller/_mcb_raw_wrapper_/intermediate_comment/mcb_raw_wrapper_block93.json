    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the updating of the PLL lock signal in the event of a non-self-refresh mode for the hardware device. In the positive edge of the user interface clock (ui_clk), if the system is not entering self-refresh mode (due to negative selfrefresh_enter) and the system is not already in self-refresh mode (negative selfrefresh_mode), the value of the PLL lock ('pll_lock') is assigned to 'syn_uiclk_pll_lock'. This ensures that the system continues to function with an updated and accurate PLL lock signal, which is vital for subsequent synchronization processes."
