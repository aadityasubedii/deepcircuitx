Module name: mcb_flow_control. 

Module specification: The module `mcb_flow_control` is a Memory Controller Block (MCB) flow control unit; it primarily operates based on a state machine with five main states (READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, REFRESH_ST). This module is designed to manage commands related to memory operations such as Read, Write, Refresh, etc. 

Inputs to the module (1) clk_i: the clock input, (2) rst_i: 10-bit reset, (3) cmd_valid_i: command validation, (4) cmd_i: command type, (5) addr_i: command operation address, (6) bl_i: burst length for command operation, (7) mcb_cmd_full: signals whether memory command is full, (8) last_word_wr_i: last word write operation completion signal, (9) wdp_rdy_i: write data port ready signal, (10) last_word_rd_i: last word read operation completion signal, (11) rdp_rdy_i: read data port ready signal.

Outputs of the module (1) cmd_rdy_o: next command readiness, (2) cmd_o: type of command being executed, (3) addr_o: address of command operation, (4) bl_o: Burst Length for command operation, (5) cmd_en_o: signal if command execution is enabled, (6-8) wdp_valid_o/ wdp_validB_o/ wdp_validC_o: signals for different parts of data word written, (9) wr_addr_o: address for write operation, (10) wr_bl_o: burst length for write operation, (11) rdp_valid_o: read operation validity signal, (12) rd_addr_o: address for read operation, (13) rd_bl_o: burst length for read operation.

Internal signals include command FIFO ready signal (cmd_fifo_rdy), read and write command signals (cmd_rd, cmd_wr), push and transfer command signals (push_cmd, xfer_cmd), validity signals for current read and write commands (rd_vld, wr_vld), command ready signal (cmd_rdy), register for active command, address and burst length (cmd_reg, addr_reg, bl_reg), validity signal for read data port (rdp_valid), validity signals for different parts of data word written(wdp_valid, wdp_validB, wdp_validC), current and next states signals of the control flow (current_state, next_state), and signals indicating pending write or read command (cmd_wr_pending_r1, cmd_rd_pending_r1).

The module primarily operates based on a state machine with five main states (READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, REFRESH_ST). Each state manages the command execution, coordination between read and write operations, status of command FIFO and also determines the next state based on a combination of conditions from the input and internal signals. The state machine is sensitive to the condition of mcb_cmd_full, wdp_rdy_i, and rdp_rdy_i, which are signals depicting memory command buffer status, write data port readiness, and read data port readiness, respectively. Further, each register update and signal assignment happens on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk_i). Overall, this module efficiently manages the flow control in a Memory Controller Block (MCB).
