    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements an instruction cache for the A25 processor core, providing faster access to frequently used instructions. It uses a parameterized design with configurable cache lines, words per line, and ways of associativity. The cache operates through multiple states (initialization, idle, fill, etc.) and employs tag and data RAMs for storage. It handles cache hits, misses, and write-back operations, utilizing a random replacement policy when necessary. The module interfaces with the core and memory system, managing instruction fetches and cache coherency."
