This block of code is responsible for managing and updating the hash value (CrcHash) in a CRC computation process. It is triggered on the rising edge of MRxClk. When the system is in the Reset or StateIdle state, the hash value will be set to zeros. Otherwise, if the system is processing data (StateData[0]) and ByteCntEq6 flag is high, which might represent condition when 6 bytes of data have been processed, the higher-order 6 bits of the CRC register (Crc[31:26]) will be loaded into the CrcHash. The propagation delay is controlled by the Tp parameter.
