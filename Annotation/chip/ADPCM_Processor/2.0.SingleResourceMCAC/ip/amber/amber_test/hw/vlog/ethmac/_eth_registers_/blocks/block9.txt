Comment: 
This block of code manages the "irq_txb" register that controls transmit buffer (TxB) interrupts. On every rising edge of clock (Clk) or whenever a reset is issued, the block checks if a reset flag ("Reset") is active. If so, it clears the "irq_txb". But if the transmission buffer interrupt ("TxB_IRQ") is active, "irq_txb" is enabled after some propagation delay. Finally, if a certain condition is met based on "INT_SOURCE_Wr[0]" and "DataIn[0]", the interrupt is cleared after the same delay.
