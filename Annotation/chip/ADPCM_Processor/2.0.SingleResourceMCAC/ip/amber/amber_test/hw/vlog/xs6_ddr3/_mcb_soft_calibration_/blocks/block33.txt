This block of code represents a state in a finite state machine, named 'LDQS_PIN_P_TERM_WAIT'. It is responsible for handling the system in situations when the Memory Controller Block (MCB) is not ready or busy. If the MCB is not ready (MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is 0), the system is placed into the LDQS_PIN_P_TERM_WAIT state again, in a waiting loop till MCB is no longer busy. On the contrary, if the MCB is ready (MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is 1), the state of the system transitions to 'LDQS_PIN_WRITE_N_TERM'.
