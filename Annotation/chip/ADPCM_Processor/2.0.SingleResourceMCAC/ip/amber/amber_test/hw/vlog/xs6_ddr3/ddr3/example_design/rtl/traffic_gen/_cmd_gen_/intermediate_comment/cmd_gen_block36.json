    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a clock-triggered buffering mechanism. More specifically, on the rising edge of the input clock, it evaluates the logical AND of 'mode_load_d1' and the logical NOT of 'mode_load_d2', and concurrently assigns the result to 'mode_load_pulse' after a delay of 'TCQ' time units."
