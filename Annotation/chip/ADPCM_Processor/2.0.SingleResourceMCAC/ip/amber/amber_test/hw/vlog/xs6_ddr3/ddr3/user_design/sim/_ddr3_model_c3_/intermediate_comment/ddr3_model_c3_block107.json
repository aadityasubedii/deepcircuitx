    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for triggering a timing check for the 24th bit of a digital signal, represented by the array dq_in. It uses an always block to continuously monitor the state of the 24th bit of dq_in. Whenever there is a change in the state of dq_in[23], the function dq_timing_check is called with 23 as an argument. The dq_timing_check function is likely used to verify whether the state change of the 24th bit is within the expected timing margins."
