This block is a logic error detector for certain operations in Port 4, based on configuration and command inputs. Should Port 4 (configurable) receive an invalid command instruction with `p4_cmd_en` enabled, specifically a `R32` command, the block prints an "ERROR - Invalid Command" message and halts the system. It's achieved by employing an always block with conditional statements comparing certain segments of the `C_PORT_CONFIG` and `p4_cmd_instr` bits with predefined values. This block serves as an error-checking mechanism.
