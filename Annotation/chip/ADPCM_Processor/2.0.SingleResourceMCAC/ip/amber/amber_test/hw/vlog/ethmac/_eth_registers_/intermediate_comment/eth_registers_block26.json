    "block_comment": "The block assigns values to four registers: r_MAC, and r_HASH1, r_HASH0. The implementation detail includes using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog which assigns the evaluated right-hand-side (RHS) to the left-hand-side (LHS) continuously. Specifically, r_MAC register gets values from two parts: MAC_ADDR0Out for the lower 32 bits and MAC_ADDR1Out for the higher 16 bits resulting in 48-bit value. r_HASH1 and r_HASH0 registers are assigned 32-bit values from HASH1Out and HASH0Out respectively.\n"
