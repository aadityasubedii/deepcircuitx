This block of code defines an OSERDES2 (Output Serializer-Deserializer) instance (an FPGA SerDes block) for processing parallel data input into serial output data. The code is configured to operate in master mode, bypassing the general clock flip flop for data rate purposes. The data rate of the output queue (OQ) and the trailing edge output rate (OT) is defined. The SERDES unit operates in single-ended output mode. The data width is set to 2. The clock source, reset signal, and other required signals are connected. The unit receives data from 'cas_90' and outputs it via 'ioi_cas'. The RESET input is connected to 'int_sys_rst', allowing the unit to be reset from an external signal. Majority of pins are assigned default zero values, and only necessary outputs and inputs are defined.
