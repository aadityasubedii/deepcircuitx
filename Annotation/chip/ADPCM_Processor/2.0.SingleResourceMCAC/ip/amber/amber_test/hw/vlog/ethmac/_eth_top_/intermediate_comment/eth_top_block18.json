    "block_comment": "This block of code is the instantiation of an ethernet receiver module (eth_rxethmac) in a larger Verilog design. The module connects to various signals for its operation. These signals include inputs for clock (mrx_clk_pad_i), reset (wb_rst_i), and ethernet data and signals (MRxD_Lb, MRxDV_Lb). It also has output signals which indicate the state of the receiver like RxValid, RxStartFrm, RxEndFrm, and the received data (RxData). It also has control signals for the operation, such as the maximum frame length (r_MaxFL) and delay CRC enable signal (r_DlyCrcEn). Further, there are signals for error checking (RxCrcError), byte count during transmission (RxByteCnt, RxByteCntEq0, RxByteCntGreat2, RxByteCntMaxFrame), and MAC address settings (r_Bro, r_Pro, r_MAC, r_HASH0, r_HASH1)."
