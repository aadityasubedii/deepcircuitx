    "block_comment": "The block manages the reset and update of the control data in response to clock changes or reset signals in a Verilog design. At the rising edge of the MTxClk or TxReset signals, the code executes. If a reset is active (TxReset high), the ControlData[7:0] bits are cleared after a propagation delay specified by Tp. Otherwise, if the least significant bit of ByteCnt is not set (~ByteCnt[0]), the MuxedCtrlData[7:0] is assigned to ControlData[7:0] after the propagation delay."
