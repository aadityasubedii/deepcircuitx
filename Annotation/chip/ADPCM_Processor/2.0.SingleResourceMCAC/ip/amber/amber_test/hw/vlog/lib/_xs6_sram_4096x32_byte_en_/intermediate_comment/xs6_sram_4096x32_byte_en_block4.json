    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to define and control two types of Synchronous Random Access Memories (SRAM), sram4 and RAMB16BWER, for a Spartan6 device. The functionality includes initializing their respective memory contents, setting read and write modes, and determining the interaction with other modules or devices. Initialization is mainly done by setting zeroes for all input pins and memory contents. The read and write operations are set to \"READ_FIRST\" to prioritize read operations. The reset and enable of the SRAMs are defined but kept inactive by setting them to false or to a low state. Both memory units are synchronized to the same clock signal, 'i_clk', to ensure coordinated access and data transfer."
