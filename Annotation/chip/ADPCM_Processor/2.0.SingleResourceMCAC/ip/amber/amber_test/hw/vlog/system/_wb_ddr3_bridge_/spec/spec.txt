Module name: wb_ddr3_bridge. 

Module specification: The `wb_ddr3_bridge` module serves as a bridge between a wishbone bus interface and a DDR3 memory module. The module performs its function by executing read and write commands from the wishbone interface into the appropriate format for the DDR3 protocol, while managing commands addressing specific memory locations. The module signals upon successful operation completion and post operations signalization is embedded into the module. The module functions with debug information option for read and write operations, as indicated by the `LP_MEMIF_DEBUG` directive. The behavior of the module can also differ based on the FPGA design target, determined by the `XILINX_VIRTEX6_FPGA` flag.

The module contains multiple input ports and output ports. Input ports serve to receive operational requests, data, and status signals. The wishbone address bus (`i_wb_adr`) designates the memory address for read/write operations. There are select lines (`i_wb_sel`), write enable `i_wb_we`, and data input bus (`i_wb_dat`) serving for write operation. Additionally, there is an indication of a wishbone bus cycle (`i_wb_cyc`), data transfer cycle (`i_wb_stb`), and indications of status of different FIFOs (`i_cmd_full`, `i_wr_full`, `i_rd_data`, `i_rd_empty`). The output ports primarily serve to provide results of operations, acknowledgment, and operation status signals.

Internally, the module works with signals that are responsible for initiating, preserving status, and addressing read and write operations such as `start_write`, `start_read`, `start_write_d1`, `start_read_d1`, `start_read_hold`, `wb_adr_d1`. Signals `ddr3_busy` and `read_ack` indicate the module's busyness by revealing fullness of either command FIFO or write FIFO, and successful read operation acknowledgment. A signal 'read_ready' operates with a readiness element for a read operation.

The module code splits into several blocks: starting write and read status blocks, a block of commands for DDR3, a block for write operations and a block for handling read operations. Each of these blocks holds defining signals, setting signal priorities, and executing conditions for operations. An additional block is available for the debug mode. This module specification provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of the design, functionality, and operation of the `wb_ddr3_bridge` module.
