    "block_comment": "This block defines a part of a system that controls the arbitration and transfer of data between the AXI and MCB interfaces. Initially, it allows the arbitration signals to pass through (set by the `p3_arb_en` variable), assigns addresses for AXI bus by masking the address signals with the specified `P_S3_AXI_ADDRMASK`. It uses a module `mcb_ui_top_synch` to synchronize when the calibration is done (`uo_done_cal` to `calib_done_synch`). Afterwards, it defines `axi_mcb` module, which handles the communication between the AXI and MCB buses by addressing and managing data transfers. Signals related to transaction details, control, configuration, write and read channels and error checks of AXI and MCB have been used in this instantiation. The `axi_mcb` also receives the calibration signal, `calib_done_synch`."
