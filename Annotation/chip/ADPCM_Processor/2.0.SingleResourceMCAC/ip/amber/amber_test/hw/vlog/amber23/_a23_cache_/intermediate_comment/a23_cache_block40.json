    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is primarily used to manage the enablement and exclusivity of cache access. The first line activates cache access (`'enable'`) when both `i_select` and `i_cache_enable` conditions are true, achieved using the logical AND (`&&`) operation. The second line determines if the cache access should be exclusive (`'exclusive_access'`) based on the states of `i_exclusive` and `i_cache_enable`, by employing similar logical AND operation. Thus, the block sets up a conditional control mechanism for cache access using simple logical combinations."
