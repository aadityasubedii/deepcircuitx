Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for updating a register, INC_COUNTS, on every rising edge of the input clock, clk_i. The value that the register is updated to is calculated as the constant DWIDTH divided by eight. This implementation implies that the register is being used to count in increments of an eighth of the DWIDTH value, and this count is updated synchronously with the system clock.
