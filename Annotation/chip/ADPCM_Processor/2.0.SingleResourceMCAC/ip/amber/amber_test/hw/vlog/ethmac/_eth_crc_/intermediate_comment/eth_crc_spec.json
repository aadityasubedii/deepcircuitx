    "spec": "Module name: eth_crc. \nModule specification: The eth_crc module is designed to implement an Ethernet Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), which is an error-checking mechanism widely used in digital data processing. The inputs include a Clock (Clk) signal which synchronizes the circuit's operations, a Reset signal for returning the Crc register to its default value, a 4-bit Data signal for representing the data to be checked by CRC, an Enable signal for operating the CRC, and an Initialize signal to reset the Crc register without the Reset signal. The output of the module includes a 32-bit Crc output register representing the calculated checksum and a CrcError bit that flags a mismatch of the CRC calculation and the expected value. Internally, the module uses a 32-bit Crc register to hold the ongoing CRC and CrcNext wire to compute the next CRC. In the RTL code, each bit of CrcNext is individually calculated using the current Data and Crc values, employing XOR operations which are essential in the operation of Ethernet CRC. These calculations respond to the Enable signal, thereby preserving current values when the Enable signal is low. The Crc register is updated with the value of CrcNext on the rising edge of the Clock signal except when either the Reset or Initialize input signals are active. The CRC Error output is triggered if the final CRC value does not match a predefined value.\n",

Explanation: This module is implementing a version of an Ethernet CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) calculation. The CRC is a popular technique for error checking in digital data. The module reads the input data, and upon enable, performs a series of XOR operations which is the core of the CRC calculation. The result is available on the Crc output. If a reset or initialize is asserted, the CRC calculation restarts from a predefined initial value (0xFFFFFFFF). Additionally, it checks if the processed CRC value is equal to a specific value (0xc704dd7b) and if not, it flags a CRC error on the CrcError output."

Clk: This is the input Clock signal which controls the synchronization of the circuit's processes.\n2. Reset: This is an input signal that resets the Crc register to its default value.\n3. Data: A 4-bit input data signal which represents the data on which the CRC calculation will be performed.\n4. Enable: This input enables or disables the operation of the CRC. If it's high, CRC is performed; if not, the current Crc value is maintained.\n5. Initialize: This input signal initializes the Crc register to its default value without needing a reset signal.\n\nExplanation: These input signals drive the operation of the module. 'Clk' is used to manage the timing of the operations inside the module, 'Reset' and 'Initialize' are used to bring the module to its initial state, 'Data' is the incoming data that needs the CRC check, and 'Enable' allows or inhibits the data processing.\n\nOutput Ports:\n1. Crc: This 32-bit output registers represents the checksum value calculated by the CRC operation.\n2. CrcError: This is a single bit output that indicates an error if the CRC check does not match the expected value.\n\nExplanation: The 'Crc' output provides the result of the CRC operation on the input data. If this CRC value does not match a predefined value (32'hC704DD7B), that indicates an error in the data, which is signalled by the 'CrcError' output. Thus, 'Crc' is the result of the operation and 'CrcError' is the status of this result."

It is updated every rising edge of the clock if the Reset or Initialize signals are not active. If Reset is active, it is set to all ones (0xFFFFFFFF). If Initialize is active, it is also set to all ones but with a delay defined by the Tp parameter. If neither Reset nor Initialize are active, it takes the value of CrcNext with the same Tp delay.\n\nCrcNext: This is a wire with size of 32-bits that performs the calculation of the next CRC value based on the current 'Data' and 'Crc' values. The calculation is a series of XOR operations, which are fundamental in CRC calculations, responding to the Enable signal. If Enable is low, the current values are preserved. It is then liable to be transferred to the Crc register on the next rising clock edge, if Reset or Initialize are not active."
