Comment: 
This block of code controls the ready-first-data flag based on reset and empty signals in synchronous design. At each positive edge of the clock, if the reset input (rst_i) is high, it clears the read-first-data flag (rd_first_data) immediately with a typical constant propagation delay (TCQ). If the reset is not high and the FIFO is transitioning from an empty to a non-empty state (~empty && empty_r), it sets the read-first-data flag with the same delay.
