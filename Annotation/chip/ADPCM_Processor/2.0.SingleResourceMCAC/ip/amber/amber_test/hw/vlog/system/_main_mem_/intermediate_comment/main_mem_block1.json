    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for generating a writeback acknowledgment (o_wb_ack). This is achieved by using an 'assign' statement which continuously drives its output. Assign statement sets o_wb_ack to the logical AND result of the input writeback strobe signal (i_wb_stb) and the logic OR result of the signals start_write and start_read_d2. This implies that the acknowledgment is only high when a writeback strobe is present and either a write or a second cycle read is initiated."
