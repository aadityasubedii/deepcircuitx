    "module": "Module-level comment: The eth_cop module acts as a traffic controller for Wishbone bus data. Ingesting data from m1 and m2 sources, it manages data transfer, selects data, discretely acknowledges successful transactions and handles errors. The functionality is achieved using internal signals and multiple blocks that control the progress and requests of m1 and m2. Specific blocks handle acknowledgement, data output, and error conditions for each data source, as well as the bus-level access acknowledgements and errors."
