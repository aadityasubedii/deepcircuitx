Comment: 
This block controls a counter based on input signals and memory initialization status. On every positive edge of the input clock, if the memory initialization is complete (mem_init_done; a signal which might be set elsewhere), it increments the count (INC_COUNTS) by a product of the data width (DWIDTH) and the block length output register (bl_out_reg), after a designated time delay (TCQ). In case the memory initialization is not complete, it checks the fixed block length input (fixed_bl_i). If this input is zero, the counter gets incremented by the product of data width and 64. If it's non-zero, it uses this non-zero fixed block length to increment the counter after a delay.
