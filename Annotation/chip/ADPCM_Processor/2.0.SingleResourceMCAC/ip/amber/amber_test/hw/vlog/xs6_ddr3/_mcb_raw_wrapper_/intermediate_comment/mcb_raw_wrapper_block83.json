    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code controls the assignment of several interfaces pertaining to the status and control variables of the third command port (port 3) of a memory interface generator (MIG). When the third port is enabled (C_PORT_ENABLE[3] == 1'b1), the respective status and control interfaces (like command clock, enable signal, row address, bank address, column address, burst length, command instruction, arbiter enable, empty, and full statuses of the third command) are assigned their corresponding input signals. Else, when the port is not enabled, all these interfaces are assigned a value of 'b0, indicating no operational activity for port 3."
