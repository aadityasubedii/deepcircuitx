    "block_comment": "This is a block of Verilog code designed to perform timing checks on negative edge transitions of a given data qualifier. The 'always' command means this process repeatedly checks for falling edges of element 13 in 'dqs_in' data qualifier signal array. The timing check is performed by the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' specifically targeted at element 13."
