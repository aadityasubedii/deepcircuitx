Comment: 
This block of code configures an IO DRP (Dynamic Reconfiguration Port) and specifies the actions based on the ready/busy status of the port. The IO DRP is activated with the signal `ZIO`. For the DRP control, a command validity flag is set, the memory cell address is assigned, the write data is determined as `N_Term`, and the read/write mode is set to `WRITE_MODE`. If the `IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N` signal indicates that the IO DRP is ready, the state machine transitions to the `LOAD_ZIO_NTERM` state.
