    "block_comment": "The provided block handles resetting and updating the WriteRxDataToFifoSync3 signal. Upon the positive edge of the WB_CLK_I clock signal or a high-level Reset signal, the code enters an execution block. If the Reset signal is active, the WriteRxDataToFifoSync3 signal is promptly reset to 0. Otherwise, it reflects the value of WriteRxDataToFifoSync2. This operation is essential for maintaining meaningful transitions between the two aforementioned signals across clock cycles."
