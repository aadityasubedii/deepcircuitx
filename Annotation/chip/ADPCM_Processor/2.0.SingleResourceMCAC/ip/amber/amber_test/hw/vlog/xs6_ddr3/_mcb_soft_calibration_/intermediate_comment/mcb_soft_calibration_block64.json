    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a self-refresh request handler synchronised to the rising edge of the UI_CLK signal. When a reset or a self-refresh request event occurs, it resets WaitTimer and sets (or resets for self-refresh) the 'warm enough' flag. The block uses a timer \"WaitTimer\", which increments by one at each clock cycle if \"WaitCountEnable\" is high, stopping when it reaches '8'h4' and setting the 'WarmEnough' flag high, indicating that the system is ready for operations. Source data like the \"RST\" (reset signal), \"SELFREFRESH_REQ_Rx\" (self-refresh requests) and \"WaitCountEnable\" (timer enable signal) are used to control the block's behavior."
