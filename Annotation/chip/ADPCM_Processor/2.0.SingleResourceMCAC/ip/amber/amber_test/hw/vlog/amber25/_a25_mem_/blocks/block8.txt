Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is used for controlling the 'fetch only stall' condition in a pipeline processor, typically used in dataflow control. It performs a logical "AND" operation on the 'i_fetch_stall' input signal and the negation of the 'o_mem_stall' output signal. If the fetch process is stalled (i_fetch_stall = 1) and there's no stall in the memory process (o_mem_stall = 0), the fetch_only_stall will be asserted. As a result, the instruction fetch operation alone would be stalled, while other operations would continue, thus improving the overall efficiency of the pipeline operation.
