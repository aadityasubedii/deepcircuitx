Comment: 
This block of code is a synchronous reset system that primarily manages the WaitTimer and WarmEnough signals in a memory controller. Upon every positive edge of the UI_CLK signal, the system checks if a reset signal, RST, has been issued. If RST is true, the WaitTimer is reset to zero and WarmEnough is set to true, implying that the system is ready. Conversely, if a self-refresh request was raised (SELFREFRESH_REQ_R1) but not in the previous state (SELFREFRESH_REQ_R2) then WaitTimer is reset and WarmEnough is set to false, implying the system is not yet ready. If WaitTimer reaches a specific value (0x4), WarmEnough is set to 1, signifying readiness. If none of these conditions are met but WaitCountEnable is true, WaitTimer increments, otherwise it remains the same.
