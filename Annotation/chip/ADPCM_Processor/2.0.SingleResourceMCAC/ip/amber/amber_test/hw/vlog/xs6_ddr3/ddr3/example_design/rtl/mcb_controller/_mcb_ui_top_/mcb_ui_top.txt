Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements a top-level interface for a Memory Controller Block (MCB), 
supporting up to 6 AXI interfaces. It manages memory access requests, performs 
arbitration, and handles command and data operations. The module integrates AXI 
interfaces with the MCB, supports various memory types and configurations, and 
includes calibration features. It uses internal signals to connect AXI interfaces 
to the MCB and generates appropriate control signals for memory operations.
