This block is responsible for the control of a MIG (Memory Interface Generator) port's write functionality. The block checks if the port's enable flag, `C_PORT_ENABLE[3]`, is set and then assigns values that either activate the proper signals for data and mask writing and error handling when enabled, or resets those signals to 0, effectively deactivating the write capabilities, when not enabled.
