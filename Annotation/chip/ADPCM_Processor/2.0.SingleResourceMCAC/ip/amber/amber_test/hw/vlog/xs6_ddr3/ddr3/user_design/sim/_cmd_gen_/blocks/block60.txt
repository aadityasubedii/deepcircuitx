Comment: 
This block of verilog code creates a clocked register and generates a pulse when the input traffic run signal transitions from low to high. Upon each clock cycle's rising edge, the provided 'run_traffic_i' input is latched into 'run_traffic_r' after being slightly delayed using the '#TCQ' delay. Concurrently, 'run_traffic_pulse' is updated; if 'run_traffic_i' is high and 'run_traffic_r' is not, this indicates a leading edge, causing a pulse to be produced. If not, 'run_traffic_pulse' remains low.
