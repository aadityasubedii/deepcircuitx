This block code sets up a sensitivity list event trigger for the digital module (dm) that performs a timing check. It is specifically designed in Verilog RTL to constantly monitor the 14th bit of the dm_in input vector array. The timing check is achieved by calling the function `dm_timing_check()` whenever there's a change to the 14th bit (dm_in[13]) of the digital module's input. Essentially, it establishes an asynchronous trigger on the 14th bit of the `dm_in` array to ensure proper signal timing of the system.
