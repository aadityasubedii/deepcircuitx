Comment: 
This block of Verilog code triggers a function called `dqs_pos_timing_check` whenever there's a falling edge on the 22nd bit of `dqs_in` signal array. The function is called with a parameter of 21. The function `dqs_pos_timing_check` isn't defined in this block but is assumed to perform some timing check or synchronization related to the signal `dqs_in` at a particular point of time.
