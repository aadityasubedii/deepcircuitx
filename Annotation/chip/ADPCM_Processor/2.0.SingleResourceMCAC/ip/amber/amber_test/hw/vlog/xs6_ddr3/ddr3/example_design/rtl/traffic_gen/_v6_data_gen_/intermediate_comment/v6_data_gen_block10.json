    "block_comment": "This block manages the flag synchronization for a register hdata based on system clock. It's a sequential logic circuit triggered on rising edges of the provided system clock. It loops through a 4x multi-bit data (NUM_DQ_PINS) line, updating flags of hdata register. Hdata flags are set high on matching the selected victim-line value, and within each quad-rate clock cycle with a specified delay 'TCQ', the flags undergo a scheduled pattern of highs and lows, lastly, if conditions are unmet, the flags are held high. In essence, it's a multi-bit flag synchronizer regulating sequential computations on a 4x data line."
