    "block_comment": "The block of code sets the address mode register based on certain conditions. If there is a positive edge clock signal and the reset input's fourth bit is on, it checks if the command pattern is \"CGEN_BRAM\", and if true, it sets the address mode register to \"3'b000\" after a delay defined by TCQ; if not, it sets the register to \"3'b011\". If the reset input's fourth bit is off and mode_load_pulse is true, it sets the address mode register to the value of addr_mode_i after the same TCQ delay."
