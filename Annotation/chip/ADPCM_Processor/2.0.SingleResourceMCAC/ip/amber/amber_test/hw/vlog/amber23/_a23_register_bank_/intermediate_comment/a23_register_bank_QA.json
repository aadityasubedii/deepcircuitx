The module includes circuits to handle different modes like USR, SVC, IRQ, and FIQR, with provisions to load user mode registers and to identify and handle exceptions. It has dedicated control lines for register read and write operations. The functionality is also extended to specific register selections through muxing logic. The registers are updated in every positive edge of the i_clk signal unless there is a stall signal. The o_pc, o_rm, o_rs, o_rd and o_rn are outputs which provide the state of the PC register, RM register, RS register, RD register, and RN register respectively."
