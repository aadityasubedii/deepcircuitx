This block of Verilog RTL code is designed to control a PLL's power-up lock status. It uses a conditional statement within an `always` block, which triggers with every positive edge of either the `mcb_drp_clk` or `sys_rst`. If the `sys_rst` signal occurs, it forces `powerup_pll_locked` to '0', effectively stating that PLL is not locked. If, instead, the `bufpll_mcb_locked` signal is triggered, it signifies that the PLL has achieved lock status and `powerup_pll_locked` is set to '1'.
