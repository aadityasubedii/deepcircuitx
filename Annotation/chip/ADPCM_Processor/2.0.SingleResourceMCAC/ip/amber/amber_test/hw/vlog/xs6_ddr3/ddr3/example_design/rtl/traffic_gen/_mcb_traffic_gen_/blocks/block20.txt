This block counts the amount of read data from the memory controller block. Operating at every rising edge of the input clock (clk_i), it uses an asynchronous reset (dcount_rst) to clear the read data count (rd_data_counts) immediately if set high. Conversely, if the memory controller block's read enable (mcb_rd_en_o) becomes high, it increments the read data count by the amount of data width divided by 8 (DWIDTH/8), essentially counting the number of read data bytes.
