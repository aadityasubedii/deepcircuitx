    "block_comment": "The block of code represents an instantiation of a 2-bit OSERDES2 (Output Serializer/Deserializer) module with a name of `ioi_cas_0`. The purpose of this module is to convert parallel data to serial data. It accepts clock signal `ioclk0`, parallel data inputs `cas_90`, and control signals `pll_ce_0` and `int_sys_rst`. The serialized output is labelled `ioi_cas`. The configuration parameters specify that the conversion will happen in master mode without a bypass grid clock flip flop. The data is serialized at the specified rates for both output clock `OQ` and test clock `TQ`. All other shift inputs/outputs, additional clock signals, and training are left unused in this instance."
