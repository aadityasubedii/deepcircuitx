    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synthesizable Verilog code chunk that incrementally updates the 'acounts' register based on the 'cmd_startD' input signal and memory configurations. When the 'cmd_startD' signal is asserted, this block captures the 'addr_i' input to 'acounts'. If 'fifo_rdy_i' and 'data_rdy_i' signals are both high and the memory burst length is set to 8, it will increase the 'acounts' value by an increment which depends on the number of data queue (DQ) pins of the memory interface. Depending on the specified amount of DQ pins, increment varies from 4 to 64. This block is primarily implemented to handle FIFO interface with variable data width."
