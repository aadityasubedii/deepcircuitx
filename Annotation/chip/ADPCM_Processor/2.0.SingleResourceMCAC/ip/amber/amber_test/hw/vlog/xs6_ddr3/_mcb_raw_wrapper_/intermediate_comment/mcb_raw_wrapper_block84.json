    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is conditionally enabling and configuring a Memory Interface Generator (MIG). If the third entry of C_PORT_ENABLE is asserted, this code is responsible for activating and configuring the MIG such as enabling the command clock, setting the read and write addresses, bank address, column address, instruction command, and burst length. Also, it updates the status of command as empty or full based on MIG's state. If the condition is not met, the code simply deactivates all MIG related signals."
