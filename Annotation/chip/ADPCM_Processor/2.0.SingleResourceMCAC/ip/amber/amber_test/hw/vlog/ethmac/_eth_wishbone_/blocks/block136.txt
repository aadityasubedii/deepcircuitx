Comment: 
This Verilog RTL block is used to generate a latched reset signal, 'RstDeferLatched'. This reset signal is generated through a combination of logical operations on two input status signals: 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync2' and 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync3'. This RTL code implements a basic AND operation followed by a NOT operation. Initially, the AND operation is executed between 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync2' and 'BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync3'. The output of this AND operation is then inverted to form the final 'RstDeferLatched' signal.
