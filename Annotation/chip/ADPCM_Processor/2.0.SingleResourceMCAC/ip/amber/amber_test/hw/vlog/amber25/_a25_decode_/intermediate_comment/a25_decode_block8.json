    "block_comment": "This block of code is for executing an instruction based on certain conditions. It operates by assigning the result of a function 'conditional_execute()' to a variable 'instruction_execute'. The 'conditional_execute()' function checks the \u2018condition_r\u2019 variable and the 31st to 28th bits of 'i_execute_status_bits', and returns a value accordingly which is assigned to 'instruction_execute'."
