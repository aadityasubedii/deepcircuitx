    "block_comment": "This block of code performs write enable and data write operations for a memory module, controlled on rising edges of the input clock signal `i_clk`. The write enable signal `o_wr_en` is determined by the `start_write` flag. The write mask `o_wr_mask` is produced based on checks against the `i_wb_adr` (address) input. Conditional compilation directives are used to support multiple platforms, the `XILINX_VIRTEX6_FPGA` platform and others. The write data `o_wr_data` is loaded from the provided `i_wb_dat` (input data), which is made into a 32-bit value by repetition."
