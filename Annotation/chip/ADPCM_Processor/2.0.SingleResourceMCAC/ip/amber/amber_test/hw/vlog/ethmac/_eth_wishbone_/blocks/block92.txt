Comment: 
This code block is designated to control packet transmission based on the system's abort signals in a design. The "always" block with two sensitivity lists including "WB_CLK_I" and "Reset" demonstrates the asynchronous reset or the positive edge clock system. Here, the "Reset" will hold the transaction abort packet to be blocked set to 0, unblocking any transmission halted due to system Reset. If a new packet does not need an abort transmission and the packet in the queue does, it would set "TxAbortPacketBlocked" to 0. However, if a new packet arrives and requires aborting, it will enable "TxAbortPacketBlocked" by setting it to 1.
