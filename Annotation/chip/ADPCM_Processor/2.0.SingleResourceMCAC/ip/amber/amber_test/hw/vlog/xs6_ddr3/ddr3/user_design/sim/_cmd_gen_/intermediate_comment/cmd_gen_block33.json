    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for address boundary checking in a synchronous design with a clock signal 'clk_i'. Upon every positive edge of the clk_i, it checks if the current address (addr_out[31:8]) is equal to or larger than the ending address (end_addr_i[31:8]). If the condition is true, it sets the 'gen_addr_larger' signal to 1, indicating a boundary violation, otherwise it resets the signal to 0."
