    "block_comment": "The block of code serves to control the signal 'TxAbortPacket_NotCleared' based on various conditions, within a system working on a Writeback Clock (WB_CLK_I) or upon system reset (Reset). The signal is initially set to 0 with a system reset. The block further implements conditions: if 'TxEn', 'TxEn_q', and 'TxAbortPacket_NotCleared' are asserted, the signal will be reset to 0 again. The signal is set to 1 if either 'TxAbort_wb' is triggered while transmission is not in burst mode, the master writeback transmission is active and the master access has finished without any transmission abort packet being blocked, or if 'TxAbort_wb' is triggered with no master writeback transmission and no transmission abort packet being blocked."
