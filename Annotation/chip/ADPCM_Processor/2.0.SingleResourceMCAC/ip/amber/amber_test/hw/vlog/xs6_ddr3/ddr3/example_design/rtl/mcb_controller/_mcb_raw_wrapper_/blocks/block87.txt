This function performs ceiling division. The inputs are two integers, 'num' and 'div'. The operation involves dividing the 'num' by 'div' and rounding up. The rounding up is achieved if the remainder of 'num' divided by 'div' is greater than zero, then 1 is added to the result quotient. Otherwise, nothing is added.
