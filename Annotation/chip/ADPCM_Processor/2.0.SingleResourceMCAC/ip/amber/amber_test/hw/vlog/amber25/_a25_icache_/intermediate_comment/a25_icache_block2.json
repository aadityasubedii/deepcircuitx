    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a cache hit error check mechanism in a Verilog RTL design. The block operates on the positive edges of either a `reset` signal or `clk` (clock) signal. On reset, the code does not perform any operations. However, when clocked and the total sum of `data_hit_way` (interpreted as instances of cache hits across eight different ways of set-associative cache) exceeds 1, it issues an error message through `$display` about a cache hit occurring in more than one cache way. The check happens synchronously on every clock edge."
