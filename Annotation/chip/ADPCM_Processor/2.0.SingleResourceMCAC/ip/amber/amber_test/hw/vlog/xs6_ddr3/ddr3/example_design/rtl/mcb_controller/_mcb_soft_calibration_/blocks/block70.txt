This Verilog block controls the request for self-refresh mode of a memory controller block (MCB) based on certain conditions. The operation starts at the rising edge of User Interface Clock (UI_CLK). If the reset (RST) signal is active, the SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ is set to 0, effectively negating the self-refresh request. Additionally, if both Phase Lock Loop (PLL) is locked (PLL_LOCK_R2) and there is no outstanding self-refresh request (signified by the negation of SELFREFRESH_REQ_R3), the SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ is also set to 0. Lastly, if the current state equals START_DYN_CAL and a new self-refresh request arises (SELFREFRESH_REQ_R3 is 1), the SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ is set to 1, signalling the request for MCB to enter self-refresh mode.
