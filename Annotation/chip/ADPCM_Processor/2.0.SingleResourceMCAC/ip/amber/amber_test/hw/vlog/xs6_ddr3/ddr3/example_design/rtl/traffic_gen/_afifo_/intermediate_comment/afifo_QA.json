FIFO depth and data size are parameterized. Write and read operations are driven by independent clocks (wr_clk and rd_clk) and controlled by respective signals (wr_en and rd_en). The module also provides flag signals such as full, empty and almost_full for better managing the data flow. The memory storage used here is a 1-dimensional array of registers. It uses gray code for addressing to prevent synchronization issues. The module incorporates handling for synchronization (SYNC) to match the read and write pointers with their captured versions."
