    "block_comment": "This line of code is defining a signal `rdy_busy_n` as a boolean condition which checks if the variable `state` is in the `READY` state. Implementation-wise, it uses the `assign` keyword to declare a continuous assignment statement, which gets evaluated every time when there are changes to the right-hand side variables, i.e., `state`. Thus this line of code reflects on 'readiness' state of a certain mechanism in the larger system and can be used as a flag for control in subsequent code structure."
