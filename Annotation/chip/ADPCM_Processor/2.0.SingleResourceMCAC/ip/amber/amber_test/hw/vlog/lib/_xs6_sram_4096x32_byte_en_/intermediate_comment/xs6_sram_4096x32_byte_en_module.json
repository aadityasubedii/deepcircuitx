    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module implements a 4096x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using 8 RAMB16BWER primitives from Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. It's organized as two banks of 2048x32 bits each, supporting read and write operations with byte-level write enables. The module uses synchronous operations, handles address decoding, and combines outputs from individual RAM blocks to form 32-bit words. It also includes parameters for initializing memory contents.\n*/"
