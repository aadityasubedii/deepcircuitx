    "block_comment": "This block of code launches a timing check whenever a falling edge (negedge) is detected on the 22nd bit of the `dqs_in` signal. The function `dqs_pos_timing_check(22)` is called whenever this condition is met. The chosen implementation is event driven, making use of Verilog's `always @` construct to efficiently trigger the function call only when the specific event occurs. This allows for effective checking of signal timing without the need for continuous polling."
