    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a write operation logger that tracks and records write operations in a decompilation file as they occur along with the time at which they occur. The block is triggered on the rising edge of 'i_clk' and only functions when the first bit of the 'get_1bit_signal' function is enabled and second bit is disabled. It generates a formatted string containing the clock count, the write command, write address, write data, and byte-enable signal. Special attention is given to specific write operations that may have been aborted, with the abort status indicated in the file. The addresses, data and byte-enables are fetched via 'get_32bit_signal' and 'get_4bit_signal' functions."
