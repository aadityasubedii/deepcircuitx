    "block_comment": "This block initializes various signal flags for error checking and comparison operations in a data processing module. All flags are individually assigned a binary zero ('b0), effectively resetting them and preparing the system for upcoming processing or error checking procedures. The flags include a general error flag, an error status, comparator data and its validity flag, and a comparator error flag."
