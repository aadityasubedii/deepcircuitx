The block assigns specific pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) data or original data to different elements of a hardware PRBS data array. The assignment is based on a given selected victim line index. If the index of an element in the hardware PRBS data array equals to any victim line index indicated by SEL_VICTIM_LINE or its multiple applied offsets, the element gets assigned the PRBS data indexed by SEL_VICTIM_LINE; otherwise, the original data indexed by the given index is assigned. This block implementation is governed by an always block, making the assignment reactive to changes in PRBS data, original data (hdata), or the victim line selection.
