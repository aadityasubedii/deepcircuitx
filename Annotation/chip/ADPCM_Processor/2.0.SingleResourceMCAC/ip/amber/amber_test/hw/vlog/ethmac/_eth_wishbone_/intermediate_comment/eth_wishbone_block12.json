    "block_comment": "This block of code declares five register variables that are all related to the RxStatusWriteLatched state. The state is propagated across pairs of registers to mitigate metastability issue by acting as flip-flops. The '_sync1', '_sync2', '_syncb1', and '_syncb2' registers are used to synchronize the 'RxStatusWriteLatched' signal between different clock domains, in two stages to avoid glitches and race conditions."
