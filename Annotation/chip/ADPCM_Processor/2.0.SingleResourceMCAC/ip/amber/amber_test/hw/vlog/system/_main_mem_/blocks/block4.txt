This block of code reads data from a memory section denoted by 'ram'. It achieves this by utilizing the 'assign' keyword, which establishes a continuous assignment link between 'rd_data' and the relevant section of the 'ram' memory. The selection of memory address relies on a subset of bits (ranging from bit 2 to bit 27, both inclusive) from the variable 'addr_d1'.
