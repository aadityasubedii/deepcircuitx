Module-level comment: The ddr3_afifo module serves as an Asynchronous FIFO interface for DDR3 memory, managing command, write, and read data operations across different clock domains (system and DDR). It employs specific input and output ports for controlling these operations and utilizes internal signals to check the emptiness of FIFOs. The module is architectured into three sub-blocks each for command, write, and read operations, each having an asynchronous fifo for efficient operations management across the clock domains.
