Comment: 
The block of code serves as a sensitivity list to the signal `dq_in` at index 10, triggering the `dq_timing_check` function whenever there is a change in the state of `dq_in[10]`. The `always` keyword means that this process is continuously monitoring for changes indefinitely. Once a change is detected, it calls the `dq_timing_check` function with the parameter 10, presumably to perform some timing checks or operations on this specific bit of the signal.
