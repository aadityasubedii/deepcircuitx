This block is a SERDES (Serializer/Deserializer) module instantiation, specifically an OSERDES2 instance, named `ioi_ldm_0`. The role of this block is converting between parallel and serial data. In this scheme, data inputs `D1` and `D2` represent the parallel input data to be serialized, and `TQ` output provides serialized output data. Similarly, `T1` and `T2` are used for transmission control. Its clock signal is fed by `ioclk90` and its reset signal comes from `int_sys_rst`. The settings (`DATA_RATE_OQ`, `DATA_RATE_OT`, `OUTPUT_MODE`, `SERDES_MODE`, `DATA_WIDTH`) define the configuration for data output rate, output mode, SERDES mode, and data width respectively.
