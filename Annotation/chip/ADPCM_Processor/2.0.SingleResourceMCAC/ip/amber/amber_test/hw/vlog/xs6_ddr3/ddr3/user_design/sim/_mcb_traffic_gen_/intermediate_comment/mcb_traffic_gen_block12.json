    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a parameterized asynchronous FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure (afifo). This FIFO structure receives a specific clock quality factor (TCQ), width of the data bus (DWIDTH), depth of the FIFO (32), address space size (5), and a synchronization status (1) to adapt to different system needs. The parameters are fully customizable, allowing this FIFO block to be adapted for various applications requiring buffer storage and data synchronization in digital systems."
