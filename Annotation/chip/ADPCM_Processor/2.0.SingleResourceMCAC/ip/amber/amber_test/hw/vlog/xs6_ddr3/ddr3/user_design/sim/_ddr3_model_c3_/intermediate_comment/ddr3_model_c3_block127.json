    "block_comment": "This block of code is a procedural block that specifies a condition and a system task. When there is any change in the 4th bit (index 3, starting from 0) of the data queue input (dq_in), it initiates a timing check procedure (dq_timing_check) connected to the statement for the specific index 3. The 'always' keyword in Verilog RTL codes triggers the execution of its procedural block whenever the condition (dq_in[3]) changes. The procedural block in this case involves the execution of the system task dq_timing_check with the argument 3. Therefore, this block is used to monitor changes to bit 3 of dq_in and perform the respective timing check via the system task when it changes."
