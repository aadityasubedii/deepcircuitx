This block conditionally assigns data based on an address and a data mode. On a clock's positive edge, if fifo_rdy_i is true or cmd_startC is initiated, it enters a sub-process. If sel_w1gen_logic is selected, a switch statement determines the address segment. Each case assigns w1data from the Data_Gen or Data_GenW0 function based on the data_mode_i. If the address doesn't match any cases, w1data is defaulted to zero. Besides, if MEM_BURST_LEN equals 8, w1data's sections are reassigned their values and moved towards a lesser index.
