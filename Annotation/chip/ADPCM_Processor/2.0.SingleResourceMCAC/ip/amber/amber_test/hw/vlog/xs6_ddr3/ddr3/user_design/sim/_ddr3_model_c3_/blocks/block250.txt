The block of code initializes the dqs_string array with predefined strings. Specifically, it assigns "DQS" to the first index of the array (dqs_string[0]) and "DQS_N" to the second index (dqs_string[1]). This is done in the initial begin-end block to ensure that it only executes once at the start of the simulation.
