Module name: write_data_path.

Module specification: The `write_data_path` module serves as an interface or 'glue logic' for a data generation module (wr_data_gen) within a memory system. It controls data flow in a memory system by handling the assignment of ready, validity, and other control signals necessary for writing data to the memory. Input ports include `clk_i` (the clock input), `rst_i` (reset input), `cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i` (command valid input signals), `prbs_fseed_i` (hexadecimal seed for pseudo-random binary sequence generator), `data_mode_i` (mode for input data), `fixed_data_i` (fixed input data), `addr_i` (address input), `bl_i` (block length input), and `data_rdy_i` (signal marking data readiness). Output ports include `cmd_rdy_o` (ready for new command), `data_valid_o`, `data_valid` (data validity signals), `last_word_wr_o` (last word written indication), `data_o` (actual output data), `data_mask_o` (data masking output), and `data_wr_end_o` (write operation completion signal). In addition, two internal signals `data_valid` and `cmd_rdy` are used to coordinate the process of data generation and writing on the basis of signals from `wr_data_gen` module and inputs. The module consists of assignments of internal signals and output, as well as the instance of `wr_data_gen` module. This makes it a pivotal module in controlling the data flow in the memory system.
