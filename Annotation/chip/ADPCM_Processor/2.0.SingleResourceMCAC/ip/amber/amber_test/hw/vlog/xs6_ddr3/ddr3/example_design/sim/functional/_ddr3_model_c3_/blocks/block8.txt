Comment: 
The block of code serves to Monitor a positive edge at the 25th bit of the signal 'dqs_in'. Whenever a positive edge is detected at the 25th bit of dqs_in signal, the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' is executed with the argument '24'. This function implementation is carried out using an always block in Verilog, which executes the function every time it detects a specified change (posedge in this case) on the monitoring signal.
