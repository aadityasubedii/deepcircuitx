    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a hardware block that triggers a function on the rising edge of a signal. Specifically, it uses an 'always' block that monitors the dqs_even[6] signal; when there is a positive edge transition or rising edge observed in that signal, it triggers the 'dqs_even_receiver' function with an argument of '6'. This function is implemented in such a way that it gets executed on each positive edge transition of the 'dqs_even[6]' signal."
