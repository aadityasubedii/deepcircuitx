    "block_comment": "The task called memory_read is designed to read data from memory. It starts by taking in bank, row, and column details as inputs. It then outputs the designated memory data. It establishes an address by concatenating row and column inputs. The system then invokes the function read_from_file with the input being a file descriptor and an address. This value is sent out via the data output. However, in the absence of MAX_MEM, the address is formed by concatenating bank, row, and column. It then checks if a valid index exists. If the index is valid, it retrieves the corresponding memory and sends this as output, else, it outputs a 'x' for every bit in the data bus."
