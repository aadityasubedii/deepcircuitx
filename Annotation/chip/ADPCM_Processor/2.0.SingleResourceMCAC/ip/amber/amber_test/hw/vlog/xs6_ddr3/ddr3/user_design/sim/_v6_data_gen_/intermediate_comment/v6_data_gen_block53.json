    "block_comment": "The block of code forms a conditional data pattern generation circuit in a digital system, triggered by a positive edge of the input clock signal. The circuit is configured dynamically using parameters like 'NUM_DQ_PINS' and 'DATA_PATTERN'. If the number of data-queue pins is equal to 40 and the data pattern is either 'DGEN_NEIGHBOR', 'DGEN_WALKING1', 'DGEN_WALKING0' or 'DGEN_ALL', the 'always' block activates on the rising edge of the clock signal, thereby allowing the specific data pattern generation."
