    "module": "Module-level comment: The wr_data_gen module serves as a write data generator primarily for SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 families. By controlling command readiness, data validity, and data preparation, it achieves desired write operations. Inputs like clock, reset, PRBS seed, command validity, burst length, etc. guide its operation. Outputs notify readiness to accept new commands, last data word, and write end. Internal state-management signals respond dynamically to commands. Depending on FAMILY, either a SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6 generator (sp6_data_gen/v6_data_gen) is used to produce output data."
