    "block_comment": "This block primarily regulates transmission control by latching transmission state values. During a positive clock edge of `MTxClk` or positive signal edge of `TxReset`, it checks the `TxReset` signal. If `TxReset` is high, `TxAbortInLatched` and `TxDoneInLatched` are set to 0 with an expected delay of `#Tp`, effectively resetting transmission states. Otherwise, the values of `TxAbortIn` and `TxDoneIn` are assigned to `TxAbortInLatched` and `TxDoneInLatched` respectively with the same delay, updating the latched transmission states to their current values."
