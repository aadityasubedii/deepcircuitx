    "block_comment": "The block of code generates nets, interconnecting 5 modules in a systematic way. It utilizes two nested generate loops, with the outer loop representing each of the five modules and the inner loop dealing with the 32-bit inputs and outputs (wires and registers respectively) of each module. It creates a 32-bit input wire and a 32-bit output register for each of the 5 modules, essentially setting up the fundamental input-output structure.\n"
