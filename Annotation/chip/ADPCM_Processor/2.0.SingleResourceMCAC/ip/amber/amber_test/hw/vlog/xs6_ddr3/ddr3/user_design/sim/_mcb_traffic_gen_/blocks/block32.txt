The block assigns the value of `mcb_wr_full_i` to `mcb_wr_full`. This is an instant assignment operation in Verilog, implying the output `mcb_wr_full` always mirrors the value of `mcb_wr_full_i`. By performing this, it copies the information from `mcb_wr_full_i` to `mcb_wr_full` to be used in other parts of the code.
