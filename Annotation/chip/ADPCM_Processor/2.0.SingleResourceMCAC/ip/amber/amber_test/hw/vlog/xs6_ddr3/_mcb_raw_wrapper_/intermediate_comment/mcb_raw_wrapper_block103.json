    "block_comment": "The given block of code is responsible for generating the internal system reset signal (int_sys_rst). This is implemented by using a logical OR gate ('|') to combine the external system reset signal (sys_rst) and the inverted gated Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) lock signal (~gated_pll_lock). In simple terms, this block ensures that an internal reset occurs either when the external system commands a reset, or when the PLL is not locked, effectively ensuring the system's stability."
