    "block_comment": "The block of code designates a synchronization interface for calibration completion status in a Memory Controller Block (MCB). More precisely, it instantiates a top-level synchronization module (\"mcb_ui_top_synch\") with a 1-bit width parameter and connects this new module with the main AXI system, using 's4_axi_aclk' as the clock signal. The state of calibration completion ('uo_done_cal') is input into this module, which, after synchronization, is output as 'calib_done_synch'."
