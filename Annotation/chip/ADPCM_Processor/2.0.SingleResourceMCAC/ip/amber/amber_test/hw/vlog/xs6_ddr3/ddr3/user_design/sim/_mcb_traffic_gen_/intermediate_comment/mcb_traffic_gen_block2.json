    "block_comment": "The line of code signifies the assignment of the wire signal 'mcb_wr_en_o' with the value of 'mcb_wr_en'. This assignment is done continuously, meaning whenever there's a change in the 'mcb_wr_en' signal, the change is immediately reflected in 'mcb_wr_en_o'. This is normally used to propagate signal changes onto the subsequent layers or modules of the design for synchronizing data flow."
