    "block_comment": "This block is a register update block in a memory controller. On a positive edge of the clock signal, if the reset input is high, it initializes the current address register to a predefined beginning address. However, if the write enable input signal is high and the current state is either 'INIT_MEM_WRITE' while the port mode allows writing or 'IDLE' while the port mode is read only, the current address register increments by a certain count. If none of these conditions is satisfied, the current address remains unchanged."
