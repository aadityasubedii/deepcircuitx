Module name: memc_tb_top. Module specification: This module is a testbench top-level module for a memory controller, supporting up to 6 ports. It instantiates multiple traffic generators and memory pattern controllers for each enabled port. The module configures various parameters such as data width, port modes, and address ranges. It generates and manages memory read/write traffic, compares data, and reports errors. Input ports include clock, reset, calibration status, VIO control signals, and various status signals from the memory controller for each port. Output ports consist of control signals for interfacing with the memory controller, such as command enable, instruction, burst length, address, write enable, write mask, and write data. Internal signals are used to control and monitor traffic generation for each port, including run signals, address ranges, seed values, mode settings, and error flags. The module contains several blocks: port-specific traffic generators, memory pattern controllers,
