Comment: 
This block checks if the data pattern is configured to be one of four particular values ("DGEN_NEIGHBOR", "DGEN_WALKING1", "DGEN_WALKING0", "DGEN_ALL") and the number of data query pins is set to 104. If both conditions are satisfied, it activates a specific pattern labelled "WALKING_ONE_104_PATTERN". The generate-if structure allows this pattern activation to be conditionally included at elaboration time, providing flexibility in Verilog configuration.
