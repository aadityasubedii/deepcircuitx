    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the state of the WAIT_SELFREFRESH_EXIT_DQS_CAL flag, which is related to the exit process from self-refresh mode in a Memory Controller Block (MCB). The flag's state is updated at the positive edge of the UI_CLK signal. If a reset (RST) signal is detected, the flag is cleared. If the system is not in R3 self-refresh mode and is in R2 self-refresh mode, the flag is set. Finally, if the system is waiting to exit self-refresh, no self-refresh request in R3 is pending, and a dynamic calibration after self-refresh is to be performed, the flag is reset again."
