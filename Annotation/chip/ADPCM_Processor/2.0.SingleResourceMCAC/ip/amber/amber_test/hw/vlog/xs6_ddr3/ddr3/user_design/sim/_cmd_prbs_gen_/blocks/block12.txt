Comment: 
This block of code initiates a conditional generate statement upon specific conditions in a Verilog RTL. This specific block engages when PRBS_CMD equals "ADDRESS" and PRBS_WIDTH equals 64, marking the start of a block for the generation of a 64-bit polynomial representation binary sequence (PRBS) generator specific to an "ADDRESS" command. The block is identified by the label `gen64_taps`, serving to structure and isolate the ensuing implementation related to this specific configuration. The underlying logic codes for the said configurations follow after this block.
