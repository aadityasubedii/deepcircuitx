    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for triggering the end of a start shift operation. The \"StartShiftWillEnd\" wire is set high if either the last byte has been received or all the following conditions are met: a valid reception (\"RxValid\"), end of frame (\"RxEndFrm\"), all bits in the received byte count (\"&RxByteCnt\") are 1, and the reception window is enabled (\"RxEnableWindow\")."
