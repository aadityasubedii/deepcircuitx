Comment: 
This block controls the DQS odd signal receiver. It does this by triggering an action at the positive edge of the dqs_odd[3] signal, which then calls the "dqs_odd_receiver" function with an integer argument "3". This is implemented with Verilog's always @ functionality, which begins some action whenever the specified condition, here a positive-edge clock signal, is met.
