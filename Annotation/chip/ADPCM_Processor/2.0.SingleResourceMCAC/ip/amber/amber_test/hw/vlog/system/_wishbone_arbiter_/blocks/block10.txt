Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used for Wishbone bus protocol arbitration. It passes a set of signals (address, data, selector) directly from the master to the third slave (o_s3_wb). However, signals associated with write-enable, cycle, and strobe are passed to the third slave only if the currently selected slave is the third one; if not, they are set to zero. The third slave identification happens using the 4-bit representation '4'd3'.
