This block of code carries out a timing check function for DQS (Data Quickest Serial) signal. Specifically, it is implemented as a sensitivity list for a process, triggered by a positive edge transition on the 19th bit of the "dqs_in" signal, which then calls the "dqs_neg_timing_check" function passing "18" as an argument for the function.
