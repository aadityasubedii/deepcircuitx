    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling and updating the state of the `SlotTimer`, a six-bit digital timer. The block primarily functions on the positive edge of the `MRxClk` clock signal or the positive edge of a `RxReset` signal. It starts by resetting `SlotTimer` to 0 either if the 'RxReset' signal is high or if the 'ResetSlotTimer' signal is high. Following this, if the `IncrementSlotTimer` signal is high, the current value of the `SlotTimer` is incremented by 1. On any other condition, the state of the `SlotTimer` remains unchanged. The time delay for these state changes is given by `#Tp`, indicating that there is a propagation delay.\n"
