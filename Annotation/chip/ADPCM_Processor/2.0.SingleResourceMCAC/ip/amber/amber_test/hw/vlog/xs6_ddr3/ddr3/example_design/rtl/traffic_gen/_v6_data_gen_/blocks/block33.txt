This block of Verilog RTL code generates data streams (w1data) from two specific functions Data_Gen and Data_GenW0 under various address and data mode conditions. On the rising edge of the clock or when the ready signal or start command is indicated (fifo_rdy_i  or cmd_startC), the block will evaluate the condition of internally defined addr_i and data_mode_i. Depending on the selected data mode (4'b0101 or others), it utilizes either Data_Gen or Data_GenW0 function to populate the w1data register with different values. In a specific case when the memory burst length equals 8, it reshuffles the w1data register. The default case will reset the w1data to 'b0. The timing control (#TCQ) is applied to delay the assignment, reflecting the delay attribute of the hardware system.
