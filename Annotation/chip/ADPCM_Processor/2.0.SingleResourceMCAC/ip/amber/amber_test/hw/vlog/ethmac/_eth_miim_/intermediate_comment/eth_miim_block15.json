    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code governs signal 'Nvalid' behavior and how it reacts to various system statuses. In response to a system reset or clock increase, the block initialises 'Nvalid' to 0 if a reset condition is triggered. When there is a lack of ongoing operations, as reflected by 'InProgress_q2' and 'InProgress_q3', 'Nvalid' remains 0. However, when the condition changes (ScanStat_q2 is true and SyncStatMdcEn is false), it switches 'Nvalid' to 1."
