    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is defining an output buffer (OBUFT) for clock enable signal in a memory controller block. The OBUFT, denoted as 'iob_cke', manages signal transmission from the input ('I') named 'ioi_cke', to the output ('O') labeled 'mcbx_dram_cke', controlled by the tristate control pin ('T') 't_cke'. The buffer allows an efficient transfer of signals while ensuring safety with tristate control."
