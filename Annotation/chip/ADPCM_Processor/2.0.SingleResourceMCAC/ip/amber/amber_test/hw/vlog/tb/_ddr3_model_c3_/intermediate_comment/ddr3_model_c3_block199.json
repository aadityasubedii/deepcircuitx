    "block_comment": "This block of code is in charge of receiving data through a data strobe line, specifically at the 10th position in the 'dqs_even' array. The receiving action is triggered by the positive edge of a clock signal, which is determined by the 10th bit of the 'dqs_even' array. By using the 'always @(posedge...)' structure, the block ensures that 'dqs_even_receiver(9)' is only activated when a positive edge is caught in 'dqs_even[9]'."
