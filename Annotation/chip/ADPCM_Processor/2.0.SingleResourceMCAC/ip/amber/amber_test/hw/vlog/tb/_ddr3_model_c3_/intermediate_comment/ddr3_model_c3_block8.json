    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for implementing a timing check on a specific signal in the system. Specifically, the function `dqs_neg_timing_check` is triggered on the rising edge of the digital quad signal `dqs_in[24]`. This block of Verilog RTL code ensures that real-time signal integrity is preserved and tests for potential timing violations."
