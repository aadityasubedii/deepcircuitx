    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the state transitions for a certain process or operation in a digital design. If IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N signal is not asserted, the state machine transitions to the 'WAIT2' state. Alternatively, if either RZQ_IN is high or P_Term matches 6'b111111, it transitions to the 'MULTIPLY_DIVIDE' state. If neither of the two conditions are met, the state transitions to 'INC_PTERM'."
