    "block_comment": "The code block handles the assignment of values to interface signals of a Block Random Access Memory (BRAM) module. The implementation leverages Verilog's bitwise concatenation and slicing operations to extract and assign signal values. The 'bram_addr_i' signal gets the lower 30 bits of the 'bram_cmd_i' signal concatenated with two zero bits for alignment. The 'bram_instr_i' signal is assigned the values from bits 32 to 30 of 'bram_cmd_i'. Finally, 'bram_bl_i' (a 6-bit signal) receives a slice from the 'bram_cmd_i' signal corresponding to bits 38 to 33."
