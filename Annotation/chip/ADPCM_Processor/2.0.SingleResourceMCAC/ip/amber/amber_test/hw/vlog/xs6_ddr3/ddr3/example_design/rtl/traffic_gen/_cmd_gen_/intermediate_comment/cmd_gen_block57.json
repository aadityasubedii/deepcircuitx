    "block_comment": "This block of code controls various pipeline-stage flags based on the state of the input signals. In response to a positive edge of the input clock signal 'clk_i', this block assigns new values to 'instr_vld', 'bl_out_clk_en', 'bl_out_vld' and 'pipe_data_in_vld'. Delay 'TCQ' is introduced to these assignments ensuring synchronicity with the clock signal. The 'instr_vld' and 'bl_out_clk_en' values are determined by the logic OR operation of 'cmd_clk_en' and an AND operation between 'mode_load_pulse' and 'first_load_pulse'. Finally 'bl_out_vld' is subsequently assigned to be equal to 'bl_out_clk_en' and 'pipe_data_in_vld' equals 'instr_vld'. This reflects a pipelining technique that sequentially processes instructions and operates based on the clock signal."
