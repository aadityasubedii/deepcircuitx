Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls the end-of-write signal (`data_wr_end_o`) in a data writing process. Based on a synchronous design, it acts on a positive edge of the clock cycle (`posedge clk_i`). It checks if the user burst count equals 2, or there is a command start and the burst length equals 1 and the hardware family is VIRTEX6, and the fifo (First In, First Out) buffer isn't full. If these conditions are satisfied, the write end signal is set to 1, indicating the end of the write process with a delay defined by TCQ. If these conditions aren't met, the write end signal is set to 0, implying the write process is still ongoing with a delay defined by TCQ.
