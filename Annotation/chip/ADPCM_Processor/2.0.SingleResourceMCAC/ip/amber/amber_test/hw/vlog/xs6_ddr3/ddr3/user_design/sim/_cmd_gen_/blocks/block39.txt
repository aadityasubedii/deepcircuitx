Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog handles the update of available buffer size. It is triggered on the positive edge of the input clock signal `clk_i`. The new buffer available size `buf_avail_r` is calculated as the sum of `rd_data_received_counts` and a constant "64", from which `rd_data_counts_asked` is subtracted. This calculation updates at each clock cycle, with a delay specified by #TCQ.
