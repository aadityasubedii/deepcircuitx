The block of code provides the calculated temporary addresses for the Transmit Buffer Descriptor (TempTxBDAddress) and the Receive Buffer Descriptor (TempRxBDAddress). The TempTxBDAddress calculation is done by performing a bitwise AND operation on the inverted state of the WrapTxStatusBit and the status of TxStatusWrite, extended to 7 bits, which is then AND'ed with the incremented TxBDAddress. The TempRxBDAddress is calculated differently based on the state of the WrapRxStatusBit. When the WrapRxStatusBit is high, it returns the 7 bits of r_TxBDNum. Otherwise, it returns RxBDAddress incremented by 1. This calculation involves bit extension, bitwise AND, OR and addition operations.
