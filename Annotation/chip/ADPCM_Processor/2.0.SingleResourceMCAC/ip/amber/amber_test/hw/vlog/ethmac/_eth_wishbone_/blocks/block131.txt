Comment: 
This line of Verilog code declares an assign statement which serves the function of creating a boolean comparison result, stored in the variable named as 'TxLengthEq0'. This variable is set to true if and only if 'TxLength' equals zero, otherwise it is set to false. This is quite an efficient way of quickly determining whether 'TxLength' has a meaningful (i.e., non-zero) value, which could be used within conditional statements for further processing.
