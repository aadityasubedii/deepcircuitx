    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code handles the control logic for updating the `InvalidSymbol` signal in the event of a master clock rising edge (`MRxClk`) or a reset signal (`Reset`). If `Reset` is high, `InvalidSymbol` is cleared immediately. In the absence of a reset, if `LoadRxStatus` is true and `SetInvalidSymbol` is false, `InvalidSymbol` is cleared, otherwise, `InvalidSymbol` is set when `SetInvalidSymbol` is true. Note that the symbol updates are time-delayed by `#Tp`."
