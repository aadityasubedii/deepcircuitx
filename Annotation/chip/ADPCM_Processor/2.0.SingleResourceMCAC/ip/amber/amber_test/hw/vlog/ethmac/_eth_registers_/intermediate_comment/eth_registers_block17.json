    "block_comment": "This block of code is for managing the status of a \"SetRxCIrq_rxclk\" signal in a system on receiving clock edge or Reset edge. The block incorporates three conditions controlled by the Reset signal and the status of 'SetPauseTimer', 'r_RxFlow', 'ResetRxCIrq_sync2', and 'ResetRxCIrq_sync3'. On receipt of either 'Reset' or 'RxClk' edge, the 'SetRxCIrq_rxclk' signal is evaluated and set in accordance with the conditions. If 'Reset' is active, 'SetRxCIrq_rxclk' is cleared; but if 'SetPauseTimer' and 'r_RxFlow' are active, 'SetRxCIrq_rxclk' is set. When 'ResetRxCIrq_sync2' is active and 'ResetRxCIrq_sync3' is inactive, 'SetRxCIrq_rxclk' is cleared."
