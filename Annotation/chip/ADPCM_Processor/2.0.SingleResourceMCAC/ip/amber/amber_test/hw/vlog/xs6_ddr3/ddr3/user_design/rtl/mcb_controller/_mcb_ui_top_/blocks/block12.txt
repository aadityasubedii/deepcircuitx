The given block of code is utilized for conditionally assigning interface signals and components based on the configuration. The block distinguishes between cases when the AXI interface of a second channel is disabled versus when it's enabled. If the AXI interface is disabled, indicated through `C_S2_AXI_ENABLE == 0`, all interface signals between a presumable user interface and a memory controller block (`mcb`) are straightforwardly assigned from their external to their internal representations. On the other hand, when the AXI interface is enabled, some addresses of the AXI interface are bitmask-applied to guarantee address correctness, a synchronization instance `axi_mcb_synch` is activated to facilitate synchronization of calibration signals, and a complete AXI-MCB interface named `p2_axi_mcb` is instantiated with meticulously mapped AXI and MCB signals, and AXI configuration parameters.
