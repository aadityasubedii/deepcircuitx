    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily executes a function `dqs_neg_timing_check` at the negative edge of the 13th element of the `dqs_in` array. The `always @` construct in Verilog makes the process sensitive to the change in the signal, dqs_in[12], and whenever a negative-edge (falling edge) is detected on `dqs_in[12]`, the defined function `dqs_neg_timing_check` with the argument 12 is called."
