    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the input signal 'bl_i' to the output 'wr_bl_o'. This is accomplished through the use of the 'assign' keyword in Verilog, which sets the value of a wire (in this case, 'wr_bl_o') to the value of an expression (here, 'bl_i'). This is typically used to model combinational logic. This assignment happens continuously, i.e., any change in the 'bl_i' will result in an immediate change in the 'wr_bl_o'. So in essence, the block represents a continuous assignment statement providing a direct pathway for signal from 'bl_i' to 'wr_bl_o'."
