This block of code generates the next Gray code for a read pointer in asynchronous FIFO. It does this by implementing a binary to Gray code converter. The 'rd_gray_nxt[ASIZE]' is assigned the MSB of 'rd_ptr' directly. Then, in a loop over the bits of the read pointer 'rd_ptr', each bit of the next Gray code 'rd_gray_nxt' is computed as the XOR of the current bit with the next more significant bit of the read pointer.
