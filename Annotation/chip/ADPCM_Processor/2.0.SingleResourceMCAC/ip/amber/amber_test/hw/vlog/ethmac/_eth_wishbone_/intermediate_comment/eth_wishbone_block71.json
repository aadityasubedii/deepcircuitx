    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code represents a boolean logic operation on two signals, `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync2` and `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync3`. It assigns the value of the operation to the new signal `ReadTxDataFromFifo_wb`. It performs a bitwise AND operation on `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync2` and the bitwise negation of `ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync3`. This operation might be used in situations like data synchronization, where you need to activate an event based on the state of two other signals."
