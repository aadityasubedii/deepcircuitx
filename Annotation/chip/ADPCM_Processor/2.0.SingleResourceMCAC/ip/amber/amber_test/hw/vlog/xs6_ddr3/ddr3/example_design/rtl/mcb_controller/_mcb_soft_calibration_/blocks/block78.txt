Comment: 
This block is responsible for generating a reset signal, specifically a non-violating reset signal. It leverages the bitwise AND operation with the original reset signal (RST) and another condition (Rst_condition1) to derive this output, ensuring reset occurs only when both the RST signal is asserted and the Rst_condition1 is met.
