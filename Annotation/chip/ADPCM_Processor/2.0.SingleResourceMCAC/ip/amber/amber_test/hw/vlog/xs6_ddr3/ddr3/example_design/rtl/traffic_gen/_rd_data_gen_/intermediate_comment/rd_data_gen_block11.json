    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the signal 'user_bl_cnt_is_1' dependent on a specific condition. It verifies whether the 'user_burst_cnt' equals to 2 and the 'data_port_fifo_rdy' is ready, and the FPGA family is either \"SPARTAN6\" or \"VIRTEX6\". The signal 'user_bl_cnt_is_1' is set to 1 if the condition is matched, otherwise, it's set to 0, using delay #TCQ to mimic the actual hardware delay due to RC delay and setup hold time."
