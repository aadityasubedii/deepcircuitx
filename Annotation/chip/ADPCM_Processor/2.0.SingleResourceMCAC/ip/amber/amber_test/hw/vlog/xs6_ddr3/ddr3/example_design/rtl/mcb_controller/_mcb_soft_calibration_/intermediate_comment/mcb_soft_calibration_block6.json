    "block_comment": "The block of code called FIRST_DYN_CAL is responsible for initializing a dynamic calibration process. In its implementation, it does so by setting the First_Dyn_Cal_Done bit to '1', signaling that this block has been executed at least once. The STATE is then set to START_DYN_CAL, staging the system for the commencement of the dynamic calibration process."
