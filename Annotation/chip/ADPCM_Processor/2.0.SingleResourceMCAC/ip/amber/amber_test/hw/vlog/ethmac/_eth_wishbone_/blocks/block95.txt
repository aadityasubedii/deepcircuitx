Comment: 
This block of code primarily dictates the behavior of WriteBack (WB) signals under different conditions on a rising edge of WB clock or a reset. In terms of implementation, when a reset signal is triggered, it forcefully sets the WriteBack signals: TxDone_wb_q, TxAbort_wb_q, and TxRetry_wb_q to 0 with a propagation delay (Tp). In the absence of a reset, the old (previous) values of the WriteBack signals: TxDone_wb, TxAbort_wb, and TxRetry_wb, are preserved with a propagation delay, effectively creating a positive edge-triggered flip-flop for each signal.
