    "block_comment": "This function, `blso`, performs bit-level barrel shout to left operation on a 18-bit input signal `a`. The function is defined to take three inputs which are an 18-bit vector `a`, a shift `shift`, and a width `width`. It initializes integer variables `i`, `w`, and `s`. `w` and `s` are both calculated based on the input parameters, `width` and `shift`, respectively. `blso` is then set to zero, and a for loop is defined to iterate over each bit in `w`, and in each iteration, the `i`th bit of `blso` is set to correspond to the `(i+w-s)%w`th bit of the input `a`. This effectively shifts the bits in `a` to the left, wrapping around at the end of the signal vector."
