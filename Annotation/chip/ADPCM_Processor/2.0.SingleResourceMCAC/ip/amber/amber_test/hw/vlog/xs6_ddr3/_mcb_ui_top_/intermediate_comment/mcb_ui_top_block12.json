    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code configures address multiplexing and data routing. If the S2_AXI_ENABLE parameter is not set, direct assignments between ports are performed. If it is set, then address lines of AXI ports are first masked and the \"axi_mcb_synch\" and \"axi_mcb\" modules are instantiated. The \"axi_mcb_synch\" module synchronizes the calibration done signal, and the \"axi_mcb\" module performs the multiplexing and routing work based on the instantiated AXI configuration parameters and ports."
