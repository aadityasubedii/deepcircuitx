It performs memory operations (write/read) based on the incoming command and the internal state it is currently in. Changes in state are determined by the internal Finite State Machine (FSM). States include active address and data phases, address to data gap, and different ready conditions. The \"shift_n_expand\" task exists to expand data based on specific conditions. The memory address, write data, and whether it's a read or write operation, are stored for use in each state. Depending on the current state, parameters such as DRP_CS, DRP_ADD, MCB_UIREAD are set, which act as control signals for read/write operations. Read data is stored in 'read_data' register. The data is manipulated and shifted based on the state of the system."
