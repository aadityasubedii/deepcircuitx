The Wishbone protocol is a standard method for interconnecting different parts of a microcontroller, including the CPU, memory and peripherals. This module appears to manage read and write requests and acknowledges them. It uses buffers to store write data, addresses, and write enable signals. These tasks include checking if the buffer is empty or not, receiving data and then sending it when required, acknowledging receipt of data, and signalling when data is valid. The module also handles resets and clock inputs for synchronous operations."
