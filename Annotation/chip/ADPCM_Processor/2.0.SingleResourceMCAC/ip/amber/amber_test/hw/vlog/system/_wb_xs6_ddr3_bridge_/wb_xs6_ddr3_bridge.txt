Module-level comment: The wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge module operates as a bridge converting the Wishbone bus protocols to DDR3 memory read/write commands. The module supports variable data widths of 32 or 128 bits. Inputs control memory operations, and outputs manage data and command flow. Internal signals, registers, and conditional blocks coordinate the operational flow, buffering data when necessary, and manage specific operations based on the data width. This module facilitates efficient memory access tasks between Wishbone systems and DDR3 memory.
