Comment: 
This block of code manages the condition of a RxOverrun signal in a Verilog-based design. If a high-signal positive edge is detected on either the WB_CLK_I or Reset lines, the code initialises. On Reset, or when a write operation to RxStatus occurs, RxOverrun is set to false, indicating no overrun conditions. Else, if the Rx Buffer is full and data writing to the FIFO buffer is in progress, RxOverrun is activated to true, signalling an overrun. The timing of these updates is determined by the delay #Tp, enforcing synchronisation.
