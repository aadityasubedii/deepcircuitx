This code block stores the 11th bit of an input address on every rising edge of the clock signal, `i_clk`. The operation is implemented using a basic flip-flop design pattern, which is a common method in Verilog for holding or storing values in transitional states. This ensures that the 11th bit is detected, latched and ready for future use in the system as per the clock cycle defined by `i_clk` signal.
