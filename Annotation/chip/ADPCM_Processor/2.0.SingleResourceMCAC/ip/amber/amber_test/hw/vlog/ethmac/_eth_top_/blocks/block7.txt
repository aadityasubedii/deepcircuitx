This block is responsible for managing signal resets for transmitting pause requests in a system. As a hardware description language, Verilog is used to model a digital system. Whenever there's a rising edge of either 'wb_clk_i' (write clock input) or 'wb_rst_i' (write reset input), the block runs. If a reset signal 'wb_rst_i' is triggered, 'RstTxPauseRq' (Reset Transmit Pause Request) is set to 0. However, in the absence of a reset signal, synchronization happens. The statement 'WillSendControlFrame_sync2 & ~WillSendControlFrame_sync3' creates a synchronous reset condition for 'RstTxPauseRq' that takes effect after a period defined by '#Tp', where '#Tp' is a propagation delay. This approach ensures that the Transmit Pause Request is reset in a synchronous manner, thus facilitating effective control frame transmission.
