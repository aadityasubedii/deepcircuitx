    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of the async_rst signal. It implements an OR operation between the system reset signal (sys_rst) and the inverse (negation) of the powerup_pll_locked signal, meaning async_rst will be high when either the system reset signal is high or the powerup_pll_locked signal is not locked(i.e., is low). Thus, this block mainly serves as a part of the system's reset mechanism."
