    "module": "Module-level comment: This module generates various data patterns for stress testing and functionality verification of integrated circuits. It supports constant, address-based, hammer, walking, and PRBS patterns. The module uses parameterized data width and pattern selection, with multiple input signals controlling the generation process. It implements pattern-specific logic blocks, including PRBS generation, walking pattern shifts, and address incrementing. The final output is selected based on the data mode input, providing flexibility for different testing scenarios."
