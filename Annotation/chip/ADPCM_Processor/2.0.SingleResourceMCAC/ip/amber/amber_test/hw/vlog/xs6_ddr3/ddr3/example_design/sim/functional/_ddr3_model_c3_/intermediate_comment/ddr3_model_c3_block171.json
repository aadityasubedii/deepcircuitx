    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for implementing a timing check on the `cmd_addr` command whenever there's a change in the `cs_n_in` input signal. It calls the `cmd_addr_timing_check` function, passing in `0` as an argument. The `cmd_addr_timing_check` function then checks the timing of the `cmd_addr` command in response to changes in the `cs_n_in` input signal, ensuring proper synchronization between these commands and the system clock."
