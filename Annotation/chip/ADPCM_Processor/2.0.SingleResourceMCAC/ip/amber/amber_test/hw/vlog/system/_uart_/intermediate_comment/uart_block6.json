    "block_comment": "This block handles reading and writing to UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) registers. Notice that the processes are triggered on the rising edge of i_clk and when either wb_read_ack or wb_start_write is high. In a situation when wb_start_write is high, the block will write the value of wb_wdata32 into a specific register, denoted by the address i_wb_adr and in the case of read (when wb_read_ack is high), it reads the data from the register at address i_wb_adr and into o_wb_dat. The case statement assigns a specific register for each adress value, and for undefined addresses, it prints an error message. The updated data written to or read from the corresponding register is shown on the standard output."
