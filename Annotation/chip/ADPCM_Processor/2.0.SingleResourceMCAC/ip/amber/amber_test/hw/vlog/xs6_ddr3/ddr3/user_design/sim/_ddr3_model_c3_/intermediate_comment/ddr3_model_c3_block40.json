    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a timing check based on the falling edge (negative edge) of the 26th bit (index 25) in the data quantum synchronization (DQS) input array. The implementation leverages a user-defined function \"dqs_pos_timing_check\" which is called whenever the specified event occurs (i.e., when the 26th bit of 'dqs_in' transitions from high voltage level to low voltage level). This function presumably performs some form of timing analysis corresponding to the waveform patterns of 'dqs_in' to verify timing requirements."
