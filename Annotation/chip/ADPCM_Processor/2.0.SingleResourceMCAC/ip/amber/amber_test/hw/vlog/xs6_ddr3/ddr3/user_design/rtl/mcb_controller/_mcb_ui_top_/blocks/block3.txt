This block handles AXI to MCB interfacing within the "spartan6" system. The interfacing is achieved through `p5_arb_en_i`, `s5_axi_araddr_i`, and `s5_axi_awaddr_i`, which are assigned the respective inputs passed through bit-wise AND with the AXI address mask. Additionally, the `mcb_ui_top_synch` module is used to synchronize the `calib_done_synch` signal with the system clock (`s5_axi_aclk`). An instance of `axi_mcb` is declared with parameters specific to the "spartan6" system. This block uses the assigned addresses, system clock, and reset signals, to manage read and write operations between the AXI and MCB interfaces, and also handles calibration through `calib_done_synch`.
