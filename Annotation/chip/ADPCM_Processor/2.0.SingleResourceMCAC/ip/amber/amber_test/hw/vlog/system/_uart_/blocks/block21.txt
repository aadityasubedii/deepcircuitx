Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for resetting and incrementing a bit pulse counter in a transmitter application. The code block operates at the positive edge of the input clock signal (`i_clk`). If the `tx_bit_pulse_count` meets certain conditions, it resets to zero, otherwise, it increments with every clock cycle. When the count reaches `TX_BITADJUST_COUNT-1` and `txd_state` equates to `TXD_STOP2`, or the count reaches `TX_BITPULSE_COUNT-1` and `txd_state` differs from `TXD_STOP2`, it resets `tx_bit_pulse_count` and sets `tx_bit_pulse` to 1. In all other scenarios, `tx_bit_pulse_count` increments and `tx_bit_pulse` resets.
