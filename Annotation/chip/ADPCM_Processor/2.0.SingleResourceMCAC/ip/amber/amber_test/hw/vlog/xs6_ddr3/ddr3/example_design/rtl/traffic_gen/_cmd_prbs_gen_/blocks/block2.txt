The block of code generates a Pseudo-Random Bit Sequence (PRBS). It executes always at changes of the top-level bit slice (SEED_WIDTH-1:1) of the input Linear Feedback Shift Register (lfsr_q) and the constant zeros (ZEROS). The PRBS algorithm relies on shifting the lower 6 bits (lfsr_q[6:1]) of the lfsr_q, padding with the specified zero pattern (first 7 bits of zeros: ZEROS[SEED_WIDTH - 1:7]) to form the output prbs sequence.
