    "block_comment": "The block assigns the value of `txd` to `o_uart_txd` and manages full, empty, and half-full states of the transmit FIFO buffer (`tx_fifo`). If the FIFO mode (`fifo_enable`) is active, it considers the FIFO buffer as full when `tx_fifo_count` reaches or exceeds 16 and empty when `tx_fifo_count` equals 0. Otherwise, it depends on `tx_fifo_full_flag` for determining full and empty buffer states. It also maintains a half-full or less condition where it is set true when `tx_fifo_count` is 8 or less."
