This block of code is responsible for updating the state of the `data_valid_r` signal when a positive edge of the clock `clk_i` is detected. The state of `data_valid_r` gets assigned the value of `data_valid_i` after a delay specified by the time constant `TCQ`. This delay models the timing characteristics of a digital system and ensures a synchronized update of `data_valid_r` with respect to the `clk_i` signal.
