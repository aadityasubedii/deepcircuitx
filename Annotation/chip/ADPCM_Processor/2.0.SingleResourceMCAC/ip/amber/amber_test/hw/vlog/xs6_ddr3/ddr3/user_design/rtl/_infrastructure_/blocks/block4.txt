Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code creates a composite asynchronous reset signal. The reset signal, `async_rst`, is the logical OR of the system reset signal, `sys_rst`, and the negated status of a power-up PLL lock (`powerup_pll_locked`). This means that `async_rst` will be set to high (reset state), if either the system reset is high, or if the PLL lock is not established, ensuring the system remains in the reset state under these conditions.
