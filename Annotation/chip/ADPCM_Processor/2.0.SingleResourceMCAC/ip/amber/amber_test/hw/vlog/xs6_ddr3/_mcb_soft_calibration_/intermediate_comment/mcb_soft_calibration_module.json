    "module": "Module-level comment: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), including input termination and dynamic DQS calibration. It uses a state machine to control the calibration process, interfacing with IODRP controllers for I/O operations. The module adjusts termination values, sets DQS delays, and optimizes signal integrity through multiple calibration passes, including RZQ/ZIO calibration and dynamic calibration. It handles self-refresh requests and manages the calibration sequence based on various input signals and internal counters."
