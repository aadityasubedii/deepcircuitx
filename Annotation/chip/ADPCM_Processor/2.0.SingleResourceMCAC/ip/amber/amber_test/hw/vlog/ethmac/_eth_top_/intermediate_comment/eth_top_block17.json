    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code implements a synchronous reset mechanism for two signals, CarrierSense_Tx1 and CarrierSense_Tx2. On the positive edge of either the mtx_clk_pad_i or wb_rst_i signals, if a reset condition (wb_rst_i) is detected, both CarrierSense_Tx1 and CarrierSense_Tx2 are asynchronously reset to 0. This action typically happens during initial startup or when a reset operation is required. Alternatively, in the absence of reset, on each positive clock edge (mtx_clk_pad_i), the block updates CarrierSense_Tx1 with the current state of mcrs_pad_i and CarrierSense_Tx2 with the previous state of CarrierSense_Tx1, effectively creating a shift register effect."
