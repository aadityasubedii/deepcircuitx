Comment: 
This block monitors the input signals `wb_clk_i` and `wb_rst_i` and updates the output registers `temp_wb_ack_o_reg`, `temp_wb_dat_o_reg`, and `temp_wb_err_o_reg` accordingly. On positive edge of reset signal, the output registers are reset to their initial values. On the contrary, during positive clock edge, the `temp_wb_ack_o_reg` and `temp_wb_err_o_reg` register values are set to acknowledge and error signals respectively, which are boolean '&' with inverses of their own, and `temp_wb_dat_o_reg` gets updated with `temp_wb_dat_o`.
