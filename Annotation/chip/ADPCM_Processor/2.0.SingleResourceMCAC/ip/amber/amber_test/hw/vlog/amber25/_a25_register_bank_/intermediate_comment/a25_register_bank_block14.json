    "block_comment": "This block of code is a register file in a processor, activated on a positive edge of a reset or clock signal. When reset, all the registers from r0 to r14 are set to a default 'dead_beef' and r15 is set to 'c0_ffee'. Under normal operation, on every clock trigger, the code checks if a write enable signal for each individual register is active. If it's active, the code assigns the input register value to the respective register. Similarly, if the read_data writing enable 'read_data_wen' for any register is active, it'll assign the respective read data to the register. The block also includes mode-dependent writes, where it checks the write enable signal and a condition based on the processor mode, such as FIRQ, USR, SVC, IRQ, before making assignments. Lastly, the program counter, 'r15', is updated with the program counter value when its write enable signal is active, or with the read_data on a DMemory write enable."
