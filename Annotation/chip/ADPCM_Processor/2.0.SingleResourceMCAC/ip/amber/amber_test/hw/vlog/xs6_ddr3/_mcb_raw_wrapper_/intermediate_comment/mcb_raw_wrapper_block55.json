    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code functions as a reset or initial state setter for multiple system registers and soft flags. It ensures that all the variables are assigned a initial low value (`'b0`), effectively rendering them currently inactive or their related modules/operations disabled. The implementation involves explicitly assigning each signal or register bit to `'b0` using 'assign' statements, ensuring a deterministic and known initial state which has critical importance in hardware design for avoiding any unexpected behavior or glitches."
