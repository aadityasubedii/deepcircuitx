Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for error detection and command validation for port 5 in write-only mode. If the C_PORT_CONFIG register indicates a "W32" mode (indicating a 32-bit write operation), and a command_en signal is active indicating an instruction is pending, it checks the instruction bits. If the bits don't correspond to a valid command for the write-only mode, an error message is shown on the console and the simulation is terminated using the $finish system call.
