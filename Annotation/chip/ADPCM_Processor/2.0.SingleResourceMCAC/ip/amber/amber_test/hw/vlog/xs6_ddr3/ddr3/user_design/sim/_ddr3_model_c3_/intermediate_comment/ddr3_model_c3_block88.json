    "block_comment": "The block of code triggers a timing check based on a specific bit. The check is activated whenever there's a change in the 43rd bit (0-indexed) of dq_in signal/binary number. The 'always' keyword implies that the function 'dq_timing_check' is called for bit with index 42 at any change in its value. More precisely, once there is a value change (either a rising or falling edge) in the 43rd bit of the dq_in signal, the timing check function associated with this bit (dq_timing_check(42)) is invoked."
