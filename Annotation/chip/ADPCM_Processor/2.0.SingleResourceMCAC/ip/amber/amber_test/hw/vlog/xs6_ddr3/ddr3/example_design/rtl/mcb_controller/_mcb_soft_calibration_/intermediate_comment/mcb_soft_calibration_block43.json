    "block_comment": "This block defines the 'SKEW' state in a finite state machine and computes certain values. It assigns the results of several dividing and multiplying operations to different variables such as `P_Term_s`, `N_Term_w`, etc. This block also updates the values of `P_Term` and `N_Term` variables. These operations might be used for different mathematical calculations related to a hardware design. The last line of the block moves the state machine to the 'WAIT_FOR_START_BROADCAST' state, demonstrating that after processing this block, the program waits for a broadcast start signal."
