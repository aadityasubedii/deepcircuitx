    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is a conditional \"generate\" statement that queries if the width of the write back data bus (WB_DWIDTH) is 32 bits. The generate construct is used in parametric or configurable designs, allowing the logic inscribed within its scope to be included or excluded during design elaboration based on the condition provided. If the condition (WB_DWIDTH being 32) is met, the logic under the label 'wb32r' is then included in the final elaborated design."
