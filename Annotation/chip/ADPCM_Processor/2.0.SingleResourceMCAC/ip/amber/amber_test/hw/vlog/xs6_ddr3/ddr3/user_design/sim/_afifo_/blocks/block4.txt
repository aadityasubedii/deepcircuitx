This block of code implements a binary to Gray code converter with a specific focus on the write pointer (wr_ptr) in a hardware system. The code uses bitwise XOR operations in a loop to convert each binary number to its equivalent Gray code. The most significant bit (MSB) of the Gray code is the same as the binary number, and all other bits are generated by XOR'ing the nth and (n+1)th bits of the binary number.
