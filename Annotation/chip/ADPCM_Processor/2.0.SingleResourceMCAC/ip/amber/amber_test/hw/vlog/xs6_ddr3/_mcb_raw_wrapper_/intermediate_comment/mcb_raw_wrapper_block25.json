    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents an implementation of a 2-bit OSERDES2 serializer. The block is configured to operate in master mode, with separate data rates for output (OQ) and tristate (OT), and is designed to process inputs independently of the global clock. Data to be serialized (ras_90) is fed through D1 and D2 inputs and serialized data is output through the OQ output signal. Meanwhile, 't_ras' is used as tristate control input and 'pll_ce_0' as clock enable. The block is reset via 'int_sys_rst' signal. All other inputs are held at inactive states (zero)."
