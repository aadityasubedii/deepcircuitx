    "block_comment": "The block of code seems to define a register named \"user_bl_cnt_is_1\". The implementation detail behind this is that it just declares a register (a hardware storage element) and doesn't carry out any operations. However, without the full context, a detailed comment cannot be applied. This register could be used in other parts of the code for a variety of reasons such as to hold some validation flag, intermediate result, or a state variable depending on the logic implemented within the RTL code. Future references to this register within the code should provide more detail about its specific usage."
