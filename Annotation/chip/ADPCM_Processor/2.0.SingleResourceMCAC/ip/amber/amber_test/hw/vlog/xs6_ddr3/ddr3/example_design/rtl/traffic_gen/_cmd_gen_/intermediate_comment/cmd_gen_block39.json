    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a portion of a data buffer management unit in a hardware design. Specifically, it calculates the available buffer space on every positive clock edge. Implementing by subtracting the `rd_data_counts_asked` count from the total of `rd_data_received_counts` and a fixed value of 64, and updating the `buf_avail_r` register with the result, introducing a delay defined by #TCQ."
