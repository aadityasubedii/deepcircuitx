Comment: 
The block of code manages the state of the `WaitCountEnable` signal in a synchronous digital system. This is achieved through an `always` block triggered at the rising edge of the `UI_CLK` signal. If the `RST` signal is high, `WaitCountEnable` is set to zero. Similarly, if `SELFREFRESH_REQ_R2` is not high while `SELFREFRESH_REQ_R1` is high, `WaitCountEnable` is again set to zero. Otherwise, if the `PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH` signal changes from low to high, as indicated by its comparison with `PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH_R1`, the `WaitCountEnable` is set to one. If none of these conditions are met, `WaitCountEnable` remains unaltered.
