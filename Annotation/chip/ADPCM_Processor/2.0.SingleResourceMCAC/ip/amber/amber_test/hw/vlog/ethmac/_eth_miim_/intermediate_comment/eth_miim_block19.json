    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a synchronous reset controller for 'EndBusy' and 'EndBusy_d' flags. By using positive edge triggered flip-flops, it manages these flags based on the 'Reset' and 'Clk' signals. When 'Reset' is high, both flags are reset to 0 after a delay represented by '#Tp'. Otherwise, during a positive edge of the clock cycle, 'EndBusy_d' is set to the inverse logic AND of 'InProgress_q2' and 'InProgress_q3', after a '#Tp' delay. Simultaneously, 'EndBusy' is set to the value of 'EndBusy_d'. This effectively sets 'EndBusy' flags at end of a process, hence the name 'EndBusy'."
