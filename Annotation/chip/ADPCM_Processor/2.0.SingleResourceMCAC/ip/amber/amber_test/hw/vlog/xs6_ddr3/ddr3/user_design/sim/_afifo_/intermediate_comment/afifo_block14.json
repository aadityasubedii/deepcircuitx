    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the current write pointer's value to the write address. This operation is implemented using an assign statement, a continuous assignment statement in Verilog RTL code, which indicates that any change in the value of 'wr_ptr' would instantly update the 'wr_addr'. Essentially, 'wr_addr' mirrors the 'wr_ptr', ensuring synchronization in their values."
