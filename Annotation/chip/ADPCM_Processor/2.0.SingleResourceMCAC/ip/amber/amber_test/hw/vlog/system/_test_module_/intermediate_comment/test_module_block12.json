    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for updating the `sim_ctrl_reg` register value at each rising edge of the `i_clk` signal. The assignment within this always block assigns an immediate value to `sim_ctrl_reg`; the value assigned is `3'd` which is an interpretation of `AMBER_SIM_CTRL` as a 3-bit decimal number."
