This block of code performs an initial assertion check for the memory burst length in a test bench for a Traffic Generator system. By explicitly comparing the memory burst length (MEM_BURST_LEN) with 4 and 8, it ensures that the system only operates with these specified burst lengths. If a different burst length is encountered, the block displays a warning message stating that the current logic does not support On The Fly (OTF) Burst Mode, only generating traffic for burst length 8 (BL8).
