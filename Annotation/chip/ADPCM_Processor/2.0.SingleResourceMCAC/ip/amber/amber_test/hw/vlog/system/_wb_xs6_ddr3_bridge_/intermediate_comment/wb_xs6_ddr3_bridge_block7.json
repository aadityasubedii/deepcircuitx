    "block_comment": "This block of code writes data to a memory location on a rising-edge clock cycle. When the signal `i_cmd_full` is not asserted, the write enable register `wr_en_r` captures the current state of `write_request` indicating if a write operation needs to take place. The write mask output `o_wr_mask` is set to the bitwise inverse of `wb_sel` signal, and this dictate which byte lanes to write. The data to be written `o_wr_data` is set to the value of `wb_dat`. The entire write operation is synchronized with the rising edge of the input clock `i_clk`."
