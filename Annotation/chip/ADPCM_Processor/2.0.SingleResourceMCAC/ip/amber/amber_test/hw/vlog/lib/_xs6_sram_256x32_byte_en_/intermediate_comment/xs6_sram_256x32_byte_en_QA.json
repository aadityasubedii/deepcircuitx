The SRAM uses distributed RAM in SDP (Single Dual Port) mode provided by the `RAMB8BWER` core. It performs both read and write operations, with the operation determined by the `i_write_enable` signal. The SRAM accepts 32-bit data input and outputs 32-bit data, assigns addresses with an 8-bit address line, and uses the 4-bit `i_byte_enable` signal to enable writing to specific bytes. Data width and address width are parametrized, but it expects them to be 32 and 8 respectively, as set in the initial block."
