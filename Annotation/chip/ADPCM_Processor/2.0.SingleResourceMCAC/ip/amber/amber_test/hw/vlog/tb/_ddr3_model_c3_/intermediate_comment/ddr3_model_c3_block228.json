    "block_comment": "This function calculates the absolute value of a real number. The function takes a real argument and checks if the value is less than zero. If so, it multiplies the argument by -1.0, effectively making it positive. If the argument is not less than zero, the function simply returns the argument as it is, thereby ensuring that the output is always a non-negative value."
