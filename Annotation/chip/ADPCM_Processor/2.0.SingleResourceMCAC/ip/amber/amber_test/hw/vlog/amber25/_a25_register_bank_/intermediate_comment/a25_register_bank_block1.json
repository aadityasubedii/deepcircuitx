    "block_comment": "Given just the `endmodule` keyword of Verilog without any preceding code, it's impossible to provide detailed function and implementation details of the block. However, for your understanding, the `endmodule` keyword in Verilog is used to signify the end of a module, which can define a variety of logical blocks from simple gates and flip-flops to more complex systems like multiplexers and arithmetic logic units. However, without additional information about the specific code that precedes `endmodule`, it's not possible to provide a detailed summary. It would be beneficial to provide full RTL code block."
