This block is a sequential logic block that drives the addr_out register based on various input conditions. On the positive edge of clk_i, start_addr_i is assigned to addr_out if rst_i[3] is asserted. If not, addr_out is assigned with a delay defined by #TCQ based on the value of addr_mode_reg. For six different modes of addr_mode_reg ranging from 3'b000 to 3'b101, addr_out is assigned differently choosing from bram_addr_i, fixed_addr, prbs_addr to manipulated seq_addr. For all other instances, addr_out is assigned to zero.
