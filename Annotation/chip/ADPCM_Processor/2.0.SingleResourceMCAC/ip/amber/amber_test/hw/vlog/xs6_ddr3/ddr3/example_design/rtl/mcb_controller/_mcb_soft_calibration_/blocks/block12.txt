This block of code elaborates the start of a dynamic calibration process within a potential memory controller. Following the start of the control process, it initially resets Pre_SYSRST and the counters, 'counter_inc' and 'counter_dec'. If the dynamic DQS calibration and the dynamic input termination are both skipped, the process transfers to the 'DONE' state directly. Otherwise, if the IO Delay Replica Control Ready is active and the Memory Controller Block calibration process is finished without a self-refresh request, it checks if the dynamic input termination is not to be skipped and the last calibration passed. If these conditions are satisfied, this block then updates the 'LastPass_DynCal' to indicate a successful IN_TERM_PASS and transits the controlling state to 'LOAD_RZQ_NTERM'.
