Comment: 
This block of code models the delay propagation through a bus for the `cas_n_in` signal. This is executed continuously anytime the `cas_n` signal changes. The operand `#BUS_DELAY` represents the delay value constant, simulating the physical signal propagation delay in digital hardware. Applications of this block include accurate hardware simulations and event-driven analysis.
