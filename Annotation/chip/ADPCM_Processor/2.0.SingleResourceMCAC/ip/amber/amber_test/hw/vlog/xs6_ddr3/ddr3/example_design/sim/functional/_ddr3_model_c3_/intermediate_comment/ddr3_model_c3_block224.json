    "block_comment": "The function 'open_bank_file' mainly handles file operations for a given bank number. It operates by formatting a new string 'filename' using the 'tmp_model_dir' and the input 'bank' number, and trying to open this file in write and read mode. If the opening fails, it displays an error message and terminates the program. If it succeeds, it assigns the file descriptor to the function return value 'open_bank_file' and, in debug mode, prints out an information message indicating the successful file opening."
