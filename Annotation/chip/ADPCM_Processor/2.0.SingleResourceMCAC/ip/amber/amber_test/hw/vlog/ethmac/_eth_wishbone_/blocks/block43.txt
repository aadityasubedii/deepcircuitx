Comment: 
The block manages Reset signal and conditions for writing received data to the FIFO storage. It employs edge-sensitive logic to monitor rising edges of 'MRxClk' or 'Reset'. When a reset is detected, it prevents writing received data to the FIFO by forcing 'WriteRxDataToFifo' to be zero. Otherwise, if both 'SetWriteRxDataToFifo' and negated 'RxAbort' signals are true, it allows the received data to be written into the FIFO by setting 'WriteRxDataToFifo' to one. However, it turns off the write operation, setting 'WriteRxDataToFifo' to zero, upon detecting either a 'WriteRxDataToFifoSync2' or 'RxAbort' signal.
