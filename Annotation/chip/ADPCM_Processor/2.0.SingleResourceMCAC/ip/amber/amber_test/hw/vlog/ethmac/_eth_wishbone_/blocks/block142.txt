Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the Read Pointer of a Transmit Buffer. The code is triggered on the rising edge of either the Write Back Clock Input (`WB_CLK_I`) or a full reset (`Reset`). A reset operation takes priority, resetting the Transmit Pointer Read (`TxPointerRead`) to 0. Otherwise, if the Start Transmit Pointer Read signal (`StartTxPointerRead`) is high, it sets `TxPointerRead` to 1, signaling start of read operation. However, if Transmit Enable move signal (`TxEn_q`) is high, it resets the `TxPointerRead` to 0, indicating a stop for read operation.
