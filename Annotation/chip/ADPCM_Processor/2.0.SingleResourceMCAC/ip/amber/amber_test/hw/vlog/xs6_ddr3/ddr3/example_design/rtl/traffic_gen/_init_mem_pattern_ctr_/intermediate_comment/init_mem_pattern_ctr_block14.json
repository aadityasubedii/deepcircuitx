    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code handles the control of memory buffer command. On each positive edge of input clock signal (clk_i), it checks the enabling signal (mcb_cmd_en_i) for the memory buffer command. If this enabling signal is set (i.e., equal to 1), the block value (mcb_cmd_bl_i) of the memory buffer command is transferred to the register (mcb_cmd_bl_r)."
