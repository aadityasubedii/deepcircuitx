Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is a procedural assignment with a sensitivity list, with the sole purpose of monitoring changes to the 25th bit of the `dq_in` signal. Whenever there's a change in the state of `dq_in[24]` (i.e., either from `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`), the procedure `dq_timing_check(24)` is triggered. The function `dq_timing_check(24)` is presumably defined elsewhere in the code and is called with '24' as an argument, which could possibly be used to specify which bit of the `dq_in` signal is being monitored.
