Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is assigning the value of the "cumlative_dq_lane_error_reg" to the "cumlative_dq_lane_error_r". This operation is often used for signal assignment in hardware design, wherein the left-hand side adopts the value of the right-hand side. The specific operation here seems to be part of a process for tracking cumulative data lane error rates in a data communication system.
