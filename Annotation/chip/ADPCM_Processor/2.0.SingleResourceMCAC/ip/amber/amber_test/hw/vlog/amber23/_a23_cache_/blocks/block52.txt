Comment: 
The block of code captures the address associated with a write-back request during the positive edge of the clock cycle. When a write-back request signal 'o_wb_req' is evaluated as true on a positive clock edge 'i_clk', the incoming address 'i_address' is captured and stored into the 'miss_address' variable. The operation ensures that the write-back address is retained for use in consecutive clock cycles.
