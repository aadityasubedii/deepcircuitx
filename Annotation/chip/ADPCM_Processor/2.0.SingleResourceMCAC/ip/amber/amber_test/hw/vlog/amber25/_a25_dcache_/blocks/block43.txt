This block of Verilog RTL code serves to assign values to the variable `con_read_data_word` based on the specific range in `data_wdata_r` indexed by the `i_address` input values. More specifically, the 'i_address' bits 3 through 2 are matched against these predefined conditions, 2'd0, 2'd1, and 2'd2. If a match is found, a slice of the 'data_wdata_r' variable (32-bit per slice) is assigned to 'con_read_data_word'. If none of the conditions are matched, the final part of 'data_wdata_r' (i.e., bits 127 through 96) is assigned to 'con_read_data_word'.
