    "block_comment": "The block is a control circuit for a command ready (cmd_rdy) signal. It uses a clock signal (clk_i) and a reset signal (rst_i), as well as a command start signal (cmd_start), an input signal (bl_i), a user burst count, and a FIFO status signal (fifo_not_full). On a reset or if the command is just starting and input is high, it sets the cmd_rdy high. If the command is starting and input is low, it sets cmd_rdy low. It also sets cmd_rdy high when the burst count is 2 and the FIFO is not full. All assignments to cmd_rdy are delayed by a #TCQ time unit."
