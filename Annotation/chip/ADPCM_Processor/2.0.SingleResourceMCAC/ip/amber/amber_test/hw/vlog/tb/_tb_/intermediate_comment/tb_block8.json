    "block_comment": "The block of code helps in debug and verification of the hardware and in choosing different cores for the device. It also defines a couple of register and wires related to a testing framework. The block opens with an instance of the `dumpvcd` module which will be used for logging value change dump (VCD) for debugging hardware simulations. Following this, it decides to include certain parameter and function files based on whether AMBER_A25_CORE is defined or not. If AMBER_A25_CORE is defined, it includes \"a25_localparams.vh\" and \"a25_functions.vh\", otherwise \"a23_localparams.vh\" and \"a23_functions.vh\" are included. Lastly, it declares a register 'testfail' and two wire 'test_status_set' and 'test_status_reg' which are 32-bit wide."
