Comment: 
This block handles signal assignment for certain output clocks and control enables associated with the system's Phase-Locked Loop (PLL). Specifically, it ties 'sysclk_2x_bufpll_o' and 'sysclk_2x_180_bufpll_o' to 'ioclk0' and 'ioclk180' respectively, and 'pll_ce_0_bufpll_o' and 'pll_ce_90_bufpll_o' to 'pll_ce_0_i' and 'pll_ce_90_i' respectively. These assignments ensure that the output signals directly track their corresponding input signals.
