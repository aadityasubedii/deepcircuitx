    "block_comment": "This block handles data and memory address updating based on a positive edge clock event. When the system state is READY, it synchronizes the memory cell address, data to be written, and the read/write signal to the rising edge of the DRP_CLK. These updates are done through memory cell address register (memcell_addr_reg), data register (data_reg), and read/write register (rd_not_write_reg), ensuring that their respective values are up-to-date with the system state."
