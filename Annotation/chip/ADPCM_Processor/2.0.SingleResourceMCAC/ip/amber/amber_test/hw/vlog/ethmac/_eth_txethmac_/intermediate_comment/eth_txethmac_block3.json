    "block_comment": "The Verilog RTL block enables hardware implementation of CRC initialization. It performs the operation by leveraging a bitwise OR operation on \"StateIdle\", \"StatePreamble\", and a bitwise OR reduction of \"DlyCrcCnt\", generating an output \"Initialize_Crc\". The result output indictes the necessity to initialize Cyclic Redundancy Check, signifying either idle state, preambulatory state, or when any bit in DlyCrcCnt is active."
