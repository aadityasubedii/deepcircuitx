    "spec": "Module name: eth_outputcontrol. \n\nModule specification: The eth_outputcontrol module is designed for handling output control within an Ethernet MAC (Medium Access Control) controller, specifically managing output of MDO (Output data) and MDOEN (Output data enable signal) based on synchronous events dictated by a rising edge clock or reset signal. The module utilizes various input and output ports. Input ports include Clk (system clock input), Reset (system resetting signal), WriteOp (defines write or read operation mode), NoPre (determines if a preamble is required), InProgress (status signal for ongoing operation), ShiftedBit (indicates a bit that has been shifted), BitCounter (7-bit order/count of bits processed), and MdcEn_n (an enable signal for Management Data Clock). Two output ports exist viz., Mdo (data output) and MdoEn (enabling signal for Mdo, controls validation of output data). Internally, the module uses signals like SerialEn (controls serial data processing), MdoEn_2d and MdoEn_d (two flip-flop stages for MdoEn for synchronization and sequential operations), and Mdo_2d and Mdo_d (similar to MdoEn_2d and MdoEn_d but for Mdo). The code blocks perform initialization, updating and logic for output sequence based on inputs and internal signals. This results in a module that can interact and function seamlessly within a wider Ethernet MAC system.",
