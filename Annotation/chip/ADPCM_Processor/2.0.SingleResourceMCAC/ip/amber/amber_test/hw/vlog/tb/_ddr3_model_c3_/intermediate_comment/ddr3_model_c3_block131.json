    "block_comment": "The provided block of Verilog code is a task that checks the timing boundaries for data queue (DQ) signals in a digital system. It evaluates time constraints and data validity to ensure the system operates within set parameters. Initiated with an input 'i', the task starts by checking if 'dqs_in_valid' is true, indicating that the DQS signal is valid. It then checks if the current system time minus the last known time of DQS signal is less than a predefined time hold (TDH). If it's less, it means there is a timing violation and hence, an error message is displayed. The block continues to a second layer of check when 'check_dq_tdipw' of 'i' is true. If the recent system time minus last known DQ signal's time is less than the minimum DQ pulse width (TDIPW), it denotes another timing violation, thereby triggering another error message. To finalize, 'check_dq_tdipw' of 'i' is set to zero and the current system time is recorded as the last known DQ signal's time."
