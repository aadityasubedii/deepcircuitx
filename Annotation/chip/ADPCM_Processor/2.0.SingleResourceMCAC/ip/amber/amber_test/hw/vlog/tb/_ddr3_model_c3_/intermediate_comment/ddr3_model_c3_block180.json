    "block_comment": "This block functions as an edge-sensitive receiver that monitors transitions on the `dqs_odd[11]` signal. The always block is triggered at the positive edge of the `dqs_odd[11]` signal, upon which the `dqs_odd_receiver` function with the argument 11 is called. This design exemplifies a basic digital circuit concept where certain actions are triggered in response to an edge (in this case the positive edge) of a signal."
