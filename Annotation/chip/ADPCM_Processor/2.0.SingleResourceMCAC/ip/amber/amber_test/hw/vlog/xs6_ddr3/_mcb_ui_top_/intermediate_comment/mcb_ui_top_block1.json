    "block_comment": "This block instantiates two Verilog modules, axi_mcb_synch and axi_mcb, controlling the interfacing and memory interactions in FPGA with AXI protocol support. The axi_mcb_synch synchronizes input 'uo_done_cal' and outputs 'calib_done_synch'. It functions over 's5_axi_aclk' clock. The axi_mcb, parameterized with ID, Address, Data widths and various controls, serves as an AXI interfaced memory controller for Spartan-6 family. The signals it hosts cater to Address, Write, Read channels, and Error reporting and the calibrations done in the previous module. It operates in synchronization with same clock, 's5_axi_aclk'."
