    "block_comment": "This block provides an inverted system clock signal. It utilizes the built-in Verilog \"~\" operator, which flips all the binary bits from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1, effectively creating an inverse of the original 'c3_sys_clk' signal. This inversion operation is therefore providing a system clock signal ('c3_sys_clk_n') that is the exact opposite phase of 'c3_sys_clk'."
