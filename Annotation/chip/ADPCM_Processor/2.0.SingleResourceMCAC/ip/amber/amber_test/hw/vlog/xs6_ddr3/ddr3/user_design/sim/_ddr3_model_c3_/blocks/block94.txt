This block of Verilog code is used to monitor changes on a signal, specifically the 37th bit of the dq_in input signal. Whenever the 37th bit of this signal changes, the block will execute the `dq_timing_check(36)` function. This function call is placed within an `always` block, which is a common Verilog construct that provides infinite looping behavior. Therefore, each time the specified signal changes, it triggers an event, causing the function to be called over and over again during the simulation as long as the specified condition (in this case, a change in dq_in[36]) remains true.
