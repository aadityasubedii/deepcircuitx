    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for generating the signal to reset the byte counter. The signal is generated based on three conditions: when the StartBackoff signal is high, when both the StateIdle and TxStartFrm signals are high, or when the PacketFinished_q signal becomes high. The operator '|' implements a logical OR functionality ensuring ResetByteCnt signal goes high if any of the conditions are true."
