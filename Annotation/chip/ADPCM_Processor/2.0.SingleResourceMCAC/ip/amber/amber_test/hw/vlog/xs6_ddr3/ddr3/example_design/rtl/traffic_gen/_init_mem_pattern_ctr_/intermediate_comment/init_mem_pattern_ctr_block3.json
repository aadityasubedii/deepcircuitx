    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for controlling the Burst Length (BL) mode in a RAM or memory module. At each positive edge cycle of the clock, if the reset signal is high or if the FAMILY parameter equals \"VIRTEX6\", it sets the BL mode according to the FAMILY parameter. If FAMILY is \"VIRTEX6\", the BL mode is set to FIXED_BL_MODE otherwise it is set to PRBS_BL_MODE. It also monitors the vio_modify_enable signal for changes. When vio_modify_enable is high, the BL mode gets set to the current value of vio_bl_mode_value."
