    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a function `get_index` that finds the index of a particular address in a memory array. It accepts an address as an input, which is a `MAX_BITS` length binary number. Initially, `get_index` is set to 0 indicating that the address is not found. Then, a for loop iterates over the indices of the used memory locations (`memory_used`). Inside the loop, it checks if the input address (`addr`) matches the stored address at the memory index (`address[memory_index]`). If a match is found, `get_index` is set to 1, indicating that the address exists, and the loop prematurely ends with the `disable` statement, optimizing the block for performance by reducing unnecessary iterations.\n"
