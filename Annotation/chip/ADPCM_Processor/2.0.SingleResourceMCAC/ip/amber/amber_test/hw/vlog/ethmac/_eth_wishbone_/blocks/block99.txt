The block is responsible for generating a retry pulse signal for data transmission. This occurs when the write-back retry (TxRetry_wb) signal is high and the previous state (TxRetry_wb_q) signal is low. This is an edge detection mechanism implemented using a bitwise AND operator and a bitwise NOT operator. The signal TxRetryPulse is therefore set to high only at the rising edge of TxRetry_wb. The block helps in ensuring re-transmission is initiated when required.
