    "block_comment": "The block of code enables or disables the controller ports based on the state of `C_PORT_ENABLE[3]`. If `C_PORT_ENABLE[3]` is set to 1, signals for memory interface generation like clock, enable, row address, bank address, target memory address, instruction command, and burst signal are assigned values from port 3, with an additional setting for the burst length (`mig_p3_cmd_bl`) taking into an account the command instruction or the original burst length. Condition tracking signals `p3_cmd_empty` and `p3_cmd_full` are also updated. Otherwise, if `C_PORT_ENABLE[3]` is set to 0, all these signals are disabled by assigning them a value of 'b0."
