    "block_comment": "The function `pick_way` is responsible for picking a way or path based on the input valid bits and a random number. It is designed to consider a 3-bit space where each particular bit from valid_bits represents a specific way. If a bit in the valid_bits is '0', that corresponding way is selected. If all bits are '1', it chooses based on a given random number. The random_num value's higher 3 bits are utilized in a case statement to decide the way when multiple options are available, providing a form of pseudo-random way selection."
