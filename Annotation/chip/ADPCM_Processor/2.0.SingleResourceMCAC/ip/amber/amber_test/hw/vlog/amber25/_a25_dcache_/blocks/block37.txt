Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog functions as a conditional write hit operation in a memory model or cache. It generates a write hit request when all the requisite conditions are met simultaneously. The conditions include: a prior request (`request_hold`) being present; a write command being enabled (`i_write_enable`); and the system being currently idle (`idle_hit`). The use of the `assign` keyword implies that it captures the combinational logic of the said conditions and propagates the value of the expression on its right to the nets on its left, `write_hit` in this case, immediately and continually when any of the conditions change.
