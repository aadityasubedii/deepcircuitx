    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily deals with command signal updating based on certain constraints in a synchronous context. The code operates synchronously with a clock signal 'clk_i', triggering on its positive edge. The signals, cmd_start, cmd_startB, cmd_startC, cmd_startD, cmd_startE, and cmd_startF, are each updated with the result of a bitwise AND between two input signals after a delay defined by #TCQ: 'cmd_validC_i' and 'cmd_rdyC' for cmd_start; 'cmd_valid_i' and 'cmd_rdyB' for cmd_startB; and 'cmd_validB_i' with 'cmd_rdyC', 'cmd_rdyD', 'cmd_rdyE', and 'cmd_rdyF' for cmd_startC, cmd_startD, cmd_startE, and cmd_startF respectively."
