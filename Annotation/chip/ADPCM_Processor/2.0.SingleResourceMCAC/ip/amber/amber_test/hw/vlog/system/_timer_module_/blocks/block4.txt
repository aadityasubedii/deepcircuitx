Comment: 
This block manages 3 timers (timer 0, timer 1, and timer 2) for the Amber processor on the positive edge of the clock. Firstly, it handles the control registers for each timer based on the 16-bit input address. Furthermore, it manages the loading of values into the timer registers and sets the behavior when the timer counts down to zero; the resulting behavior is reloaded based on the control register, set to a maximum value, or decremented based on the pre-scaled bits in the control registers. The block also handles flags signaling the completion of the countdown, clearing them if instructed to do so or setting them when the timer counts down to zero.
