    "block_comment": "This block of code is centered around state transitions of a state machine. The current state, assigned to the 'control_state' variable, determines the next state, as assigned to 'control_state_nxt'. This reassignment process occurs within multiple if-statements, which represent the various potential transitions based on states such as RST_WAIT2, EXECUTE, INT_WAIT1, etc. Additionally, the block of code considers special circumstances surrounding MEM_WAIT1 and MEM_WAIT2 states, with specific sub-conditions implemented within nested if-statements. Certain conditions such as 'write_pc', 'dabt', 'mtrans_instruction_nxt[15:0] != 16'd0', and others, determine whether these sub-transitions should take place. Furthermore, if 'instruction_valid' is true, multiple state transitions possibilities are outlined, including further conditional transitions based upon states such as 'load_op', 'type', 'current_write_pc', etc."
