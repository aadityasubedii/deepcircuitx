This block of code is a clocked register. This block operates by triggering on the positive edge of the input clock (clk_i). When a clock cycle starts (rising edge), the value of 'run_traffic_i' is registered into 'run_traffic_reg' after a delay of #TCQ time units. This usage of delay modeling ensures that the assignment takes place after the specified delay duration. It helps to accurately model the behavior of a register with a certain-clock-to-Q delay in real hardware designs.
