    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily serves as a reset and read data counter function, designed to work synchronously with the rising edge of a clock signal. Upon receiving a reset signal, the read data count ('rd_data_counts_asked') is set back to 0. However, if a command enable signal ('cmd_en_i') is on and the command has been sent, it increments the count of 'rd_data_counts_asked' by the value obtained by adding 1 to 'bl_sent'. This indicates the number of read requests that have been initiated, helping to track the read operations."
