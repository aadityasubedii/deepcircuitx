    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for monitoring changes in the 37th bit (since count starts from 0) of the dq_in bit-vector. Upon any change in the 37th bit, the function `dq_timing_check(36)` is invoked. This is most likely used for timing verification where the effect of the 37th bit change on the rest of the design is evaluated and validated. This block is implemented using an always block which triggers the function call every time the particular bit in the bit-vector changes."
