Module-level comment: The module `xilinx_dist_ram_16x32` is a 16x32-bit memory utilizing Xilinx's distributed RAM primitives. It has read and write capabilities with respect to inputs (data_in, we, wclk, read_address, write_address) and outputs (data_out). The 32 1-bit memory cells are implemented using RAM16X1D sub-modules, managing each bit of the word independently. Control signals (we, wclk) govern the synchronizing operations of these sub-modules. The reading and writing addresses are handled internally through `waddr` and `raddr` signals respectively.
