Comment: 
This block is used for timing checks on the negative edge of data strobe signal dqs_in[31]. It's implemented using the keyword 'always @', which triggers upon the positive edge of the dqs_in[31] signal. Once this trigger condition is met, the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function is called with the argument value '31'. This function, not described here, presumably performs the necessary timing checks.
