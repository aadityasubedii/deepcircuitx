    "block_comment": "This block of code reviews whether a change has occurred to the 'ras_n_in' signal in the circuit. Upon detecting a change, the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function is called with '1' as a parameter. It forms a part of a hardware design intended to monitor changes in specific inputs and initiate designated functions. The block is designed based on event-driven programming in Verilog, making it sensitive to changes in the state of 'ras_n_in'."
