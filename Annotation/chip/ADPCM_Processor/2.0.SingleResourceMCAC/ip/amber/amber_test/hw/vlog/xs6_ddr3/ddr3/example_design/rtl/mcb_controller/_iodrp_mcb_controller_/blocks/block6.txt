Comment: 
This Verilog code block controls the AddressPhase flag based on different states of a sequential system. The system works synchronously with the positive edge of DRP_CLK signal. Upon activation of the synchronous reset (sync_rst) signal, the AddressPhase flag is reset to 0. If the system is not in reset, the AddressPhase flag is affected by the state of the system and the bit count. If the AddressPhase flag is set, it remains high until the system reaches the state ALMOST_READY2. When the AddressPhase flag is low, it only goes high when the system reaches the ADDR_PHASE state and the bit count equals seven (binary 111).
