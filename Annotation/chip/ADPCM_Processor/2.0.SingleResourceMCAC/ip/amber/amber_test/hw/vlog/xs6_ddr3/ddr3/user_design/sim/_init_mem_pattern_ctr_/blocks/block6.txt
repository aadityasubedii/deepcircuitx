Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for setting modes of data and address for a hardware synthesizer on positive edge of the clock signal. Initially, when reset input is high, default modes are set (for data mode as '011' and for address mode as '11'). If the 'vio_modify_enable' bit is set, it captures new values for 'syn1_vio_data_mode_value' and 'syn1_vio_addr_mode_value' from 'vio_data_mode_value' and 'vio_addr_mode_value' respectively. The change in state is based on the rising edge of 'clk_i' and the values of 'rst_i' and 'vio_modify_enable'.
