This block of code controls a safe asynchronous reset. When a positive clock edge for MRxClk or a high signal for Reset is detected, the 'ShiftEndedSync_c2' logic signal is updated. If Reset is active, this signal is set to '0' immediately. However, if Reset is not active, this signal is set to the previous state of 'ShiftEndedSync_c1' after a propagation delay defined by Tp.
