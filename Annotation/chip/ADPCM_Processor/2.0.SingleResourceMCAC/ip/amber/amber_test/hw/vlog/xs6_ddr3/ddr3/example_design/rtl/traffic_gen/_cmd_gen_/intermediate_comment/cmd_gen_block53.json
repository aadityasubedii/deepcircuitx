    "block_comment": "This block of code checks if the command pattern does not match the \"CGEN_BRAM\" pattern. In Verilog, the \"generate\" keyword is used to enable conditional compilation of hardware. The \"if\" statement is used to compare the current command pattern with the defined pattern \"CGEN_BRAM\". If there's a mismatch, the code block named \"cv2\" is executed. This conditional check operation makes it possible to select different patterns for different command operations."
