    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code refers to a synchronous system. The function of the block is to manage data shifting operations when certain conditions are met. On each positive edge of the DRP_CLK clock signal, it checks if the synchronous reset (sync_rst) is activated. If so, it initializes the shift_through_reg register to zero. When the reset is not active, two scenarios can arise. If load_shift_n signal is active, current output (data_out_mux) is loaded into shift_through_reg. Else, the code performs a one-bit shift operation, feeding the DRP_SDO bit into the shift_through_reg. This implements a shift register functionality."
