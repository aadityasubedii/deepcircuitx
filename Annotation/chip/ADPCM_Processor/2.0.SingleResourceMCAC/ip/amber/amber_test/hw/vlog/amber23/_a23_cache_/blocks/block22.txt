Comment: 
The block, synchronized to the positive edge of the `i_clk`, keeps track of the status of valid bits in a four-way cache (Specifically the most significant bit from each tag of the cache ways). In the idle state of the state machine, it packs the most significant (validity) bits of four cache ways into the `valid_bits_r` register. If the machine is not in the idle state, the `valid_bits_r` register retains its previous value.
