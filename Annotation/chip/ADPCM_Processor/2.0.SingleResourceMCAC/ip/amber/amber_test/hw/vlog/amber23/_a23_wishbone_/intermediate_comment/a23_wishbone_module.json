    "module": "Module-level comment: The a23_wishbone module is designed to interface with the Wishbone protocol for synchronous data transfer between CPU cores, caches, and FPGA peripherals. It controls read/write requests and manages exclusive access requests. This is achieved by a state machine-based system which handles the operational flow and monitors the status of the bus and buffers. It also has specific functionalities for debugging, error handling, and operational pausing. This module uses several always blocks for managing write buffer operations, data transfer, and the transitioning states of the Wishbone state machine."
