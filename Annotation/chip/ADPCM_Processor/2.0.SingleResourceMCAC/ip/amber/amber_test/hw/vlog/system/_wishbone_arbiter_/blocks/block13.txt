Comment: 
This block of Verilog code assigns values to various output registers that are part of a write-back bus. The registers include the address register (`o_s0_wb_adr`), the data register (`o_s0_wb_dat`), and the selection register (`o_s0_wb_sel`). Further, the code enables or disables the write enable (`o_s0_wb_we`), cycle (`o_s0_wb_cyc`), and strobe (`o_s0_wb_stb`) of the bus based on whether the `current_slave` value is 0. If `current_slave` is 0, these registers are controlled by corresponding `master_` registers, if not, they are disabled.
