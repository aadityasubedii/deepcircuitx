    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is responsible for creating a register named 'user_bl_cnt_is_1', and its corresponding output port 'user_bl_cnt_is_1_o'. The register 'user_bl_cnt_is_1' can store a binary value and the 'assign' statement connects the output signal 'user_bl_cnt_is_1_o' to the value stored in the register. This means the value from the register 'user_bl_cnt_is_1' can be observed on the block output 'user_bl_cnt_is_1_o'."
