    "block_comment": "The block handles the operations related to memory control register in a writeback(WB) process. Upon a positive edge of the clock (i_clk), it first checks if a write operation to the memory control register (using the address AMBER_TEST_MEM_CTRL) is about to start (indicated by wb_start_write). If the address matches and the write operation is flagged to start, it writes the least significant bit of the 32-bit data (wb_wdata32) into the memory control register named mem_ctrl_reg."
