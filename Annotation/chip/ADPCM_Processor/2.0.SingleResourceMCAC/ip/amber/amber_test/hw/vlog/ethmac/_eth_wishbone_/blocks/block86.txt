This block of code represents a register update mechanism that is triggered either upon positive edge of the MTxClk clock signal or assertion of Reset signal. If the Reset signal is encountered, the LastWord register is set to 0. In the absence of Reset signal, the LastWord register either gets updated to 0 based on conditions; TxEndFrm, TxAbort, TxRetry and Flop, or with TxEndFrm_wb based on conditions; TxUsedData, Flop and if TxByteCnt equals three. This behavior ensures the LastWord register always holds relevant data according to the system state.
