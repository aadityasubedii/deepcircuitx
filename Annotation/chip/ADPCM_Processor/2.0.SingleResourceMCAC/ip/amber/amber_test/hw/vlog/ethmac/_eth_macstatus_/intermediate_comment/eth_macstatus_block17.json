    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of a flag indicating the receipt of a valid packet. It achieves this by using the bitwise NOT operator (~) on the 'LatchedCrcError' signal, implying that if there is no detected CRC error (i.e., LatchedCrcError is 0), the 'ReceivedPacketGood' flag will be set (i.e., 1), indicating a successful packet reception. Inversely, if a CRC error is detected (LatchedCrcError is 1), the 'ReceivedPacketGood' flag will clear (i.e., 0), denoting an error in the packet reception."
