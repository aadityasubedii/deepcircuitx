This block of Verilog code primarily controls the operation of the IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL and Memory Controller Block (MCB) processes in write mode. The memory cell address and write data inputs of the IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL are defined as PTerm and {2'b00, P_Term_w} respectively, and the operation mode is set to the write mode. Simultaneously, the MCB's UIADDR input is set to IOI_LDQS_CLK and the CMD_VALID input is set to 1'b1, indicating the command to the MCB is valid. The value of the STATE depends on the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal: If MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is True, STATE is assigned LDQS_CLK_WRITE_P_TERM, otherwise, STATE is assigned LDQS_CLK_P_TERM_WAIT.
