Comment: 
The given block of code is a state machine that transitions between states based on the `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` signal. If `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` is high, the state machine transitions to the `UDQS_CLK_WRITE_P_TERM` state. If `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` is low, the state machine transitions to the `UDQS_CLK_P_TERM_WAIT` state and stays there until `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` returns high, upon which it transitions to the `UDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM` state. The implementation is achieved using Verilog's if-else and case constructs for conditional and state-based logic, respectively.
