    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for serial data reception in an UART interface. It works by triggering on the positive edge of a given clock signal, where it then shifts the existing 4-bit received data (`rxd_d[3:0]`) left by one bit and appends the current received serial data bit (`i_uart_rxd`) on the right end."
