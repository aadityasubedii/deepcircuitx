    "block_comment": "[Function of the block] The block is assigning a value to the variable 'tag_address' based on the true condition from multiple source select input signals `source_sel[]`: `C_FILL`, `C_INVA`, `C_INIT`, and `C_CORE`.\n\n[Implementation details of the block] The 'tag_address' is assigned with different respective values depending upon which condition in the multi-way if-then-else statement holds true. For instance, if `source_sel[C_FILL]` is true 'tag_address' is assigned `miss_address[CACHE_ADDR32_MSB:CACHE_ADDR32_LSB]` ,and so on for other conditions. The least significant bits are filled with zeros if none of the conditions hold true."
