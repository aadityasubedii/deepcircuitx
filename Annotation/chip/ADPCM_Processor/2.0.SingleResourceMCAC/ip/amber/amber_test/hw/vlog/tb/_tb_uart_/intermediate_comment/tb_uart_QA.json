The UART design uses a clock (clk_uart) and reset signal (clk_uart_rst_n) to generate the UART's baud rate from a global definition (`AMBER_UART_BAUD`).\n\nThe module facilitates data transmission (TX) and reception (RX). The TX logic monitors control signals to start transmission, handling cases where the transmission FIFO is full and where clear-to-send (CTS) signal is inactive. The RX logic monitors received data bits, increments counters, and detects start bits based on specified conditions.\n\nThe module also supports loopback testing, where received bytes are retransmitted, allowing for internal testing and validation. \n\nIn summary, this code is used to model and verify a UART's functions (including data transmission and reception) in a simulated hardware environment."

Explanation:\n\n- `clk_uart`: This is the clock signal for the UART module. It oscillates at a rate derived from the baud rate of the UART and is used to control and synchronize operations within the UART.\n- `clk_uart_rst_n`: The reset signal for the UART's clock. When active (logical 0), it resets the UART and prepares it for operation.\n- `rx_byte`, `rx_bit`, `rx_state`, `rx_tap`, `rx_bit_count`: These are registers to manage the received data byte, bit and the state of the receiver. `rx_tap` helps in implementing the shift operations of received data, while `rx_bit_count` maintains a count of the received bits.\n- `rx_bit_start`, `rx_start_negedge`, `rx_start_negedge_d1`: These are signals to detect the start of a received data byte and the negative edge of the start bit.\n- `tx_state`, `tx_bit`, `tx_byte`, `tx_bit_count`: These are registers used to manage the transmitted data byte, bit, and the state of the transmitter. `tx_bit_count` keeps track of the data bits being transmitted.\n- `tx_bit_start`, `tx_start`: These signals are used to start the data transmission.\n- `loopback`: This signal enables the loopback mode, where received bytes are retransmitted - excellent for testing.\n- `tx_push`, `tx_push_r`, `tx_push_toggle`: These signals are related to the handling of a new data byte for transmission. `tx_push_toggle` helps to detect a change in `tx_push`.\n- `txd`: A register holding the data byte to be transmitted.\n- `txfifo_empty`, `txfifo_full`: These signals indicate the status (Empty or Full) of the transmission FIFO queue.\n- `tx_fifo`, `txfifo_wp`, `txfifo_rp`: Represents the FIFO queue and the write (wp) and read (rp) pointers to manage the transmission of data bytes."
