    "module": "Module-level comment: This mcb_soft_calibration_top module implements a soft calibration system in a memory controller, dealing with operations such as memory calibration, self-refresh modes, and signal delays using various input, output, and internal signals. It communicates, controls, and synchronizes with submodules through signals passed to/from them. Specific internal blocks and call to other modules like mcb_soft_calibration, IOBUF, and IODRP2 manage functionalities related to data flow, impedance control, and digital interface communications. Signals like UI_CLK, RST, IOCLK for inputs and DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL, SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ for outputs and several MCB_ prefix signals aid in execution. Internal signals like IODRP_ADD, IODRP_SDI, IODRP_SDO handle operation-specific details."
