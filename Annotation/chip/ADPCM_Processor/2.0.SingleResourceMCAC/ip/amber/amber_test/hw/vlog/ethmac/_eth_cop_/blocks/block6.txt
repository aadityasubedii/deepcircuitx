This block checks for errors in data handshaking processes between any of the two modules 'M1' and 'S1' or 'M1' and 'S2'. The implementation uses an 'always' block to continuously monitor for three conditions. By employing nested conditional statements 'if-else', the block checks if the module 'M1' is in progress. If 'M1' is addressing 'S1' or 'S2', it assigns the respective error signal to the 'm1_wb_err_o' output. If the strobe and cycle input signals are high and no modules are being addressed, it sets 'm1_wb_err_o' to 1 indicating an error. If the conditions are not met, 'm1_wb_err_o' is set to 0.
