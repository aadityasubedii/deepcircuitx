    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code assigns a corresponding string identifier to the variable xAS_STATE based on the current state of the wishbone state machine (wishbone_st). The state machine can be in one of five states: WB_IDLE, WB_BURST1, WB_BURST2, WB_BURST3, or WB_WAIT_ACK. These states are checked in a sequence using the conditional (? :) operator, returning the corresponding string if a match is found, and defaulting to \"UNKNOWN\" if none of the states match the current state of the wishbone state machine."
