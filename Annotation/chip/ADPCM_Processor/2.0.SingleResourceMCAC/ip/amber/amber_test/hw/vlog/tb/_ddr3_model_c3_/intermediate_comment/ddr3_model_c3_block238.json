    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code defines a delay in a digital circuit. Implementing the delay in Verilog includes using a non-blocking assignment mechanism to the 'addr_in' signal. This is performed based on the change in the 'addr' signal, denoted by the 'always @(addr)' construct. The delay is modeled using the '#BUS_DELAY' construct."
