Comment: 
This block of code is essentially a data shift register that operates at the positive edge of the DRP_CLK clock signal, with the ability to be reset synchronously. The register is set to 0 when the sync_rst signal is high. Otherwise, when the load_shift_n signal is high, the shift register loads data from data_out_mux as its new value, and when load_shift_n is low, it shifts right by one bit, with the DRP_SDO signal being the new most significant bit, and the least significant bit being discarded.
