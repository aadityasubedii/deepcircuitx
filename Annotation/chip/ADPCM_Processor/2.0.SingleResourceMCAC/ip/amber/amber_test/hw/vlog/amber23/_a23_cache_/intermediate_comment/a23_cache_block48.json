    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning a value to `tag_address` based on different conditions. Depending on the condition as dictated by the `source_sel` signal, it either assigns the `miss_address`, `ex_read_address`, `init_count` or `address` to `tag_address`. If `source_sel[C_FILL]` is true, `miss_address` with bit range `CACHE_ADDR32_MSB:CACHE_ADDR32_LSB` is assigned; if `source_sel[C_INVA]` is true, `ex_read_address` is assigned; if `source_sel[C_INIT]` is true, `init_count` with bit range `CACHE_ADDR_WIDTH-1:0` is assigned; if `source_sel[C_CORE]` is true, `address` is assigned. If none of these are true, it defaults to assigning a constant '0' with a width of `CACHE_ADDR_WIDTH` to `tag_address`."
