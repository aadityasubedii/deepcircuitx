    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily serves as a data pipe controller. The block uses an always block that's activated on the rising edge of the input clock (clk_i). Upon reset (rst_i[0]), it will latch 'start_addr_i' into the 'pipe_data_in' bus with a delay defined by 'TCQ'. If 'instr_vld' is high and conditions based on 'gen_addr_larger' and 'addr_mode_reg' are satisfied, it will assign different bytes from 'end_addr_i', with different adjustments based on the data width ('DWIDTH'). Otherwise, 'pipe_data_in' gets the bytes from 'addr_out' signal also with different adjustments, again based on 'DWIDTH'. Thus, it dynamically manages the flow of data within the pipeline based on various conditions."
