The block of code is a process that is triggered on the positive edge of the DRP_CLK signal. This block serves as a memory interface that catches signals to prepare for a memory operation. When the state of the system is "READY", some key registers are updated for the memory operation. These include the memory cell address register (`memcell_addr_reg`), the data register (`data_reg`), and a control signal register (`rd_not_write_reg`) that determines if the operation is a read or a write operation.
