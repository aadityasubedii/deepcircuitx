This block of code implements a reset delay for a particular system or device. When a reset is triggered through the 'Block_Reset' signal, the code shifts the system into a reset state (STATE is set to RST_DELAY). In the absence of a reset trigger, the system transitions into the 'START_DYN_CAL_PRE' state from 'RST_DELAY'. This design ensures a stable, controlled transition between states, providing a delay which is paramount for hardware synchronization.
