    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block aims at writing data to a specified file. It implements this function through an approach that includes: seeking the desired position in the file based on the given index (using inbuilt $fseek function), displaying a failure error and terminating the simulation if the seek operation fails, and finally writing the data using the $fwrite function. Special conditions are also handled where the first bit of data is in high impedance or zero states, where it switches these two cases with the opposite states."
