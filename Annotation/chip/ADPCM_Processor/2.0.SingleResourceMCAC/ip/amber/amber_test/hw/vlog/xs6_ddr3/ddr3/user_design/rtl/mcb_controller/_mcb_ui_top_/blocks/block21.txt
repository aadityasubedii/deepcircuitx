This Verilog code block performs a conditional memory handler for a memory controller interface driven by the AXI standard. If the AXI is not enabled, the block routes signals directly to output ports. If enabled, it creates an instantiation of the `axi_mcb` module, routing the AXI signals into it, while linking AXI/master control block (MCB) interface signals. Address masking is applied to the AXI read and write addresses. A synchronizer module, `mcb_ui_top_synch`, is also instantiated to synchronize a 'calibration done' signal. The instantiated `axi_mcb` module processes memory commands depending on the specified attributes (such as family, data width, and address space).
