This block of code is for triggering soft calibration on a memory controller. Check the situation based on the condition of the C_CALIB_SOFT_IP constant. If it equals true, a mcb_soft_calibration_top object instance is created with several configuration parameters and I/O mappings pertinent to memory operations and calibration like memory type, simulation mode, UI clock, reset signal, in/out clocks, etc. The input, output, and inout ports are then connected to corresponding signals available in the design. Finally, the memory controller user-interface clock (mcb_ui_clk) is assigned to the UI Clock (ui_clk) signal.
