Peripherals such as UART, Ethernet MAC, timers, and interrupt controller\n4. A Wishbone bus interconnect for communication between components\n5. Clock and reset management\n6. DDR3 memory controller (for FPGA implementations)\n\nThe module connects these components together, handles I/O, and provides the overall system architecture. It supports different configurations based on the target platform (e.g., FPGA vs. ASIC) and processor core selection. The system uses a Wishbone bus for internal communication and includes interfaces for external connections like UART, Ethernet, and DDR3 memory."
