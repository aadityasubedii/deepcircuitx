    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the control flow for the update of the `RxStatus` register in a synchronous fashion. It operates under a positive edge-triggered clock or a high-level reset. If a reset signal is detected, the `RxStatus` register is asynchronously reset to '0'. Otherwise, the block checks if both `RxEn` and `RxEn_q` signals are high and `RxBDRead` is active. If these conditions are met, the register `RxStatus` is updated with the data output from the ram (`ram_do[14:13]`)."
