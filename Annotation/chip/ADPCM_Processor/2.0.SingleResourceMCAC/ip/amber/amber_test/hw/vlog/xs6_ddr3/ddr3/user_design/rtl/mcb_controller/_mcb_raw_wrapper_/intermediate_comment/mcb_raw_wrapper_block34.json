    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the operation of signal 'cke_train_reg'. In the course of operation, once an internal system reset occurs (int_sys_rst), the 'cke_train_reg' signal is set to 0. However, if no system reset occurs and a delay of 200 microseconds has completed (wait_200us_done_r1) but it hasn't been processed (negation of wait_200us_done_r2), the 'cke_train_reg' signal is set to 1. The 'cke_train_reg' signal is further set to 0 when the calibration done flag (uo_done_cal) is enabled."
