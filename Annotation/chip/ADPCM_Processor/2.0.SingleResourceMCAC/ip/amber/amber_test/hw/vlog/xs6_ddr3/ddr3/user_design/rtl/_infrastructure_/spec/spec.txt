Module name: Infrastructure.
Module specification: The 'infrastructure' module is a hardware description for a clock and reset system that initializes and controls other system components. It takes system clock and reset inputs (sys_clk_p, sys_clk_n, sys_clk and sys_rst_i) and generates multiple clock and reset output signals (clk0, rst0, async_rst, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock) which are critical for the timing control of digital components within the system. The module uses a range of internal signals, like clk_2x_0, clk_2x_180, clk0_bufg, clk0_bufg_in, etc., to compute and process input and output signals. 

The module is built with different blocks such as IBUFGDS and IBUFG to select the clock type, a PLL_ADV block that serves to multiply the input clock frequency to generate other clock frequencies, BUFG and BUFGCE for clock buffering, and BUFPLL_MCB for generating strobe signals. 

It also includes parameters for adjusting the clock and reset characteristics such as C_INCLK_PERIOD, C_RST_ACT_LOW, C_INPUT_CLK_TYPE, etc. Synchronization and state handling are done using always block with condition checks to set/reset power-up lock signals. The module's design ensures a properly synchronized system clock mechanism that can adapt to various design constraints and requirements.
