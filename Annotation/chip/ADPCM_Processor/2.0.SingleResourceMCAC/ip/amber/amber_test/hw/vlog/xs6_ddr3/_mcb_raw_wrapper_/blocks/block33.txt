Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code works as a state updater for the `cke_train_reg` register, whose state essentially depends on the system reset signal (`int_sys_rst`) and two other input signals: `wait_200us_done_r1`, `wait_200us_done_r2`, and `uo_done_cal`. On a hard reset, it sets `cke_train_reg` to '0'. Otherwise, it changes the state of `cke_train_reg` to '1' when `wait_200us_done_r1` is high and `wait_200us_done_r2` is low. Additionally, if `uo_done_cal` becomes high i.e., calibration is done, it resets `cke_train_reg` back to '0'.
