    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the clearing of the transmission FIFO queue. Specifically, it assigns the logic OR of `TxAbortPacket` and `TxRetryPacket` signals to `TxFifoClear` signal. If either of the `TxAbortPacket` or `TxRetryPacket` signal goes high, it indicates that the current packet transfer needs to be aborted or retried. Subsequently, it triggers the clearing of the transmission FIFO queue."
