    "block_comment": "This block is used for clock and control signals routing. Each of the system clock signals (sysclk_2x_bufpll_o, sysclk_2x_180_bufpll_o), as well as the clock enable signals for Phase Locked Loop module (pll_ce_0_bufpll_o, pll_ce_90_bufpll_o), is assigned to an input signal (ioclk0, ioclk180, pll_ce_0_i, pll_ce_90_i respectively). Thus, the block accommodates the interfacing of clock lines or PLL control paths in the system."
