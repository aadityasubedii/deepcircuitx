Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a task called `print_pkt` that is primarily responsible for decoding and displaying Ethernet packets. First, it initiates by defining the start of an Ethernet frame and differentiates between incoming and outgoing packets. It then reads the Ethernet type and accordingly, if it's an ARP packet, it prints the ARP operation and the IP it's looking for. If, on the other hand, the packet is an IP (version 4) packet, it decodes the packet header to gather details like source IP, destination IP, protocol, and IP length. If the protocol is TCP, it further decodes the TCP header to display information such as source port, destination port, sequence numbers, acknowledgement numbers, and the TCP payload (if it is printable ASCII). Any non-ASCII or control codes in the payload are ignored.
