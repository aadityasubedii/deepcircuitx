    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is used to manipulate a mask value (lsl_mask) based on the value of a selector (lsl_selector). The technique employed is a casez statement, enabling the use of wildcard characters to match multiple cases, and therefore offering an efficient method to control the mask's adjustment. Upon matching a specified pattern in lsl_selector, lsl_mask is updated either directly with specific hexadecimal values or through concatenation of bits and predefined variables like low_mask."
