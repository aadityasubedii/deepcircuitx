Module-level comment: This module performs soft calibration for memory controller blocks, including input termination and dynamic DQS delay calibration. It uses a state machine to control the calibration process, adjusting termination values and DQS delays based on measured results. The module handles initialization, dynamic calibration, and self-refresh requests, implementing a multi-step process to optimize memory interface timing and signal integrity.
