This block of code is designed to increment counts for the VIRTEX6 family of devices. By using a generate-if structure, the Verilog compiler will only instantiate the logic within the 'if' condition if the parameter FAMILY matches the string "VIRTEX6". The block operates at the positive edge of an input clock (clk_i), meaning logic inside this block would update synchronously relative to rising edges of the clk_i signal. In other words, for every time the clk_i signal transitions from 0 to 1, the operations inside this block get executed for the VIRTEX6 device family.
