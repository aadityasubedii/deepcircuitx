The block of code is responsible for detecting if there's more than one cache hit in any of the data ways during each clock cycle or reset. It does this by summing the outcomes from data_hit_way[0], data_hit_way[1], data_hit_way[2], and data_hit_way[3] and if the sum exceeds 1, an error message "Hit in more than one cache ways!" will be displayed. The logic is performed every time a positive edge of the reset or clock signals is detected. If a reset signal occurs, this block will do nothing.
