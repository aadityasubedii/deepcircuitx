    "block_comment": "This block of code configures how different input ports interact with a Memory Controller Block (MCB) based on port enablement and port mode. When port 2, 3, or, 4 (P2, P3, P4) are enabled (C_PORT_ENABLE[2], C_PORT_ENABLE[3], C_PORT_ENABLE[4]), it deciphers the port mode (RD_MODE - read or WR_MODE - write) and assigns respective signals for interacting with the MCB from available enabled ports prioritized from port 0 to 5. These include enable signal (mcb_cmd_en_sig), instruction signal (mcb_cmd_instr_sig), address signal (mcb_cmd_addr_sig), block length signal (mcb_cmd_bl_sig) and write enable signal (mcb_wr_en_sig)."
