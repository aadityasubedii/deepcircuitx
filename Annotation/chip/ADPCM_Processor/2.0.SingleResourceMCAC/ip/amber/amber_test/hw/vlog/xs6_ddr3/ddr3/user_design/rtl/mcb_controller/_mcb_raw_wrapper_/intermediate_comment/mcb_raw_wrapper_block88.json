    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is handling address assignment based on condition checks. If the number of DQ pins is 8, an internal condition checks are applied whether the memory address order is in \"ROW_BANK_COLUMN\" format. Depending on the width of memory address and bank address along with number of column bits, different byte addresses such as `p0_cmd_ra`, `p0_cmd_ba` and `p0_cmd_ca` until `p5_cmd_ra`, `p5_cmd_ba` and `p5_cmd_ca` are assigned. If `C_MEM_ADDR_WIDTH` is not 15, or `C_MEM_BANKADDR_WIDTH` is not 3, or `C_MEM_NUM_COL_BITS` is not 12, then assignments are performed with additional zero padding. If the memory address order is not \"ROW_BANK_COLUMN\", then different specific assignments are made. The selection of the address of column, row and bank happens based on the conditional checks on width of address, bank address and column bits."
