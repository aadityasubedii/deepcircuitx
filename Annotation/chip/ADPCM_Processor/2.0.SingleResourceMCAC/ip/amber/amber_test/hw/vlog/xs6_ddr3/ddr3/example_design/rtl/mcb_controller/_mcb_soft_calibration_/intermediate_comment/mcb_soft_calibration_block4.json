    "block_comment": "This block of code belongs to a finite state machine (FSM), performing a decrement operation. Specifically, it sets the various state variables to zero and checks if 'DQS_DELAY' isn't zero. If so, it incrementally advances the 'counter_dec' variable based on the 'Inc_Dec_REFRSH_Flag' value. The FSM remains in the 'DECREMENT' state."
