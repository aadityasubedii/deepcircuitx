    "block_comment": "This block of code describes operations during a \"SWAP_WRITE\" control state without conflict when an instruction is being executed. It presets registers including data selection for barrel shifter, next data address selection, next write enable, and access control for decode stage. It also configures byte-enable based on the 22nd bit of the instruction. The execute flag is used to block program counter write enable. It also pre-fetches an instruction and decides whether the program counter should be loaded in the next cycle based on the current state."
