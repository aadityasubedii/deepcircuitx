This block implements the I/O and DQS (data strobe) logic for a 16-bit DDR memory interface. The block uses IODRP2_MCB (I/O Dynamic Reconfiguration Port for Memory Controller Block) modules to handle the data (DQ), data mask (DM), and data strobe (DQS) signals. Each IODRP2_MCB is configured with specific delay values and operating modes to manage the timing of signals for proper DDR memory operation. The implementation includes master-slave pairs for each set of signals, with daisy-chained auxiliary serial data connections between modules for configuration purposes.
