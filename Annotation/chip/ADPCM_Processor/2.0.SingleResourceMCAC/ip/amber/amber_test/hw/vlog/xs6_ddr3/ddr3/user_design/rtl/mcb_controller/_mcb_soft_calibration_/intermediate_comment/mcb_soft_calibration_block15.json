    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code is used to assign the signal \"pre_sysrst_minpulse_width_ok\" based on a specific index of the array \"pre_sysrst_cnt\". More specifically, it extracts the 4th bit (as Verilog is 0-indexed) from the \"pre_sysrst_cnt\" binary counter array and assigns this value to \"pre_sysrst_minpulse_width_ok\". This operation can be commonly used to monitor or influence the control flow depending on the 4th bit's value of the counter."
