    "block_comment": "This block handles the collision window control of a Media Access Control (MAC) transmitter. Upon each rising edge of the MTxClk or Reset, if Reset is set, the collision window (ColWindow) is enabled after a delay of `Tp`. Alternatively, if the MAC is neither in collision nor in the state of valid byte count match and certain conditions related to the Data, PAD, and FCS states are met, the ColWindow is then disabled. Should the states revert to idle or Interpacket Gap (IPG), the ColWindow is re-enabled post a `Tp` delay."
