    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a reset delay logic in a digital circuit. The always block in the Verilog code is triggered by a change in the signal 'rst_n'. The 'rst_n' signal is then passed through a delay modeled by 'BUS_DELAY' before being assigned to 'rst_n_in'. This effectively means that the code block provides a delay for the reset signal, thereby simulating the propagation delay across a bus or similar circuit components."
