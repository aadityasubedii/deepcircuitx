The block of code is setting up a conditional compile or parameterization in a Verilog "generate" construct based on the value of "DATA_PATTERN". Depending on the "DATA_PATTERN" type, this block generates their respective data pattern either "DGEN_ADDR" or "DGEN_ALL". Thus, this construct allows for making design choices at compile time by determining which parts of the code are enabled depending on the predefined parameters or compile time constants.
