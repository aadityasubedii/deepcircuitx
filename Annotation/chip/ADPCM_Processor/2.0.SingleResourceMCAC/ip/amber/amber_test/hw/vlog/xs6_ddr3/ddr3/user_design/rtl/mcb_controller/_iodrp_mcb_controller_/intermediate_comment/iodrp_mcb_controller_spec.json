    "spec": "Module name: iodrp_mcb_controller. \n\nModule specification: This module is a controller tailored for the Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) that manages read and write operations through Verilog modules, flip-flops series, and shifting sequences for the DRP. It allows storage of the memory cell address and write data, controls a shifting process, and regulates DRP commands and broadcast usage. The module also coordinates addressing and data phases with a finite state machine and modifies the data output depending on the DRP IOI address.\n\nThe module contains a selection of input and output ports, including memcell_address, write_data, rd_not_write, cmd_valid, use_broadcast, drp_ioi_addr, sync_rst, DRP_CLK, and DRP_SDO as input ports, which are primarily used for controlling and providing data for DRP operations.  Output ports like read_data, rdy_busy_n, DRP_CS, DRP_SDI, DRP_ADD, DRP_BKST, and MCB_UIREAD are present, providing operation statuses, control signals, and obtained data.\n\nInternal signals within the module, such as memcell_addr_reg, data_reg, shift_through_reg, load_shift_n, addr_data_sel_n, bit_cnt, rd_not_write_reg, AddressPhase, etc., control different parts of module behavior including memory operations, phase transitions, bit counting, and the achieved state of the module.\n\nThe module is composed of several blocks to perform specialized tasks like shifting and expansion, state representation, memory cell address storage, data storage, bit counting, read data management, shift register operations, and finite state machine transitions. These blocks are organized using certain standards like ALTERNATE_READ, address and data selection, address and data phase separation, broadcasting check to ensure an efficient and effective operation of the module. The iodrp_mcb_controller module utilizes a well-structured state machine to manage transitions between different states for a well-controlled read and write format.",

It allows storage of the memory cell address and write data, controls a shifting process, and regulates DRP commands and broadcast usage. The module also coordinates addressing and data phases with a finite state machine and modifies the data output depending on the DRP IOI address.\n\nThe module contains a selection of input and output ports, including memcell_address, write_data, rd_not_write, cmd_valid, use_broadcast, drp_ioi_addr, sync_rst, DRP_CLK, and DRP_SDO as input ports, which are primarily used for controlling and providing data for DRP operations.  Output ports like read_data, rdy_busy_n, DRP_CS, DRP_SDI, DRP_ADD, DRP_BKST, and MCB_UIREAD are present, providing operation statuses, control signals, and obtained data.\n\nInternal signals within the module, such as memcell_addr_reg, data_reg, shift_through_reg, load_shift_n, addr_data_sel_n, bit_cnt, rd_not_write_reg, AddressPhase, etc., control different parts of module behavior including memory operations, phase transitions, bit counting, and the achieved state of the module.\n\nThe module is composed of several blocks to perform specialized tasks like shifting and expansion, state representation, memory cell address storage, data storage, bit counting, read data management, shift register operations, and finite state machine transitions. These blocks are organized using certain standards like ALTERNATE_READ, address and data selection, address and data phase separation, broadcasting check to ensure an efficient and effective operation of the module. The iodrp_mcb_controller module utilizes a well-structured state machine to manage transitions between different states for a well-controlled read and write format."

It allows storage of the memory cell address and write data, controls a shifting process, and regulates DRP commands and broadcast usage. The module also coordinates addressing and data phases with a finite state machine and modifies the data output depending on the DRP IOI address.\n\nThe module contains a selection of input and output ports, including memcell_address, write_data, rd_not_write, cmd_valid, use_broadcast, drp_ioi_addr, sync_rst, DRP_CLK, and DRP_SDO as input ports, which are primarily used for controlling and providing data for DRP operations.  Output ports like read_data, rdy_busy_n, DRP_CS, DRP_SDI, DRP_ADD, DRP_BKST, and MCB_UIREAD are present, providing operation statuses, control signals, and obtained data.\n\nInternal signals within the module, such as memcell_addr_reg, data_reg, shift_through_reg, load_shift_n, addr_data_sel_n, bit_cnt, rd_not_write_reg, AddressPhase, etc., control different parts of module behavior including memory operations, phase transitions, bit counting, and the achieved state of the module.\n\nThe module is composed of several blocks to perform specialized tasks like shifting and expansion, state representation, memory cell address storage, data storage, bit counting, read data management, shift register operations, and finite state machine transitions. These blocks are organized using certain standards like ALTERNATE_READ, address and data selection, address and data phase separation, broadcasting check to ensure an efficient and effective operation of the module. The iodrp_mcb_controller module utilizes a well-structured state machine to manage transitions between different states for a well-controlled read and write format."
