    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog triggers a function called cmd_addr_timing_check with an argument of 22 whenever there is a change in the most significant bit (bit 15) of the addr_in variable. This is done using an 'always' block which monitors the specified condition and calls the function each time the condition is met. This particular implementation is common in designs that require a certain procedure or function to be executed on the event of a particular signal change."
