The block is used for controlling data validity based on different conditions. At the positive edge of the input clock, if the reset input signal is active, the data validity is set to inactive after a delay defined by #TCQ. If a user-defined burst count equals one and the data port FIFO is ready, the data validity is set to inactive after the same delay. Otherwise, if the user-defined burst count is equal to or greater than one, or the command start signal is active, the data validity is set to active after the delay.
