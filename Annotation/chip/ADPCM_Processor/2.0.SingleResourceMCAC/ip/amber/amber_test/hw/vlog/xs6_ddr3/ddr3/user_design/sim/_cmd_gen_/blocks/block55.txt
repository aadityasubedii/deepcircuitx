Comment: 
This Verilog block is essentially a clock-triggered command validation routine. It uses a flip-flop, specifically a D-type flip-flop, which gets triggered at the positive edge of the incoming clock signal `clk_i`. The command validity, represented by the `cmd_vld`, is updated at every positive edge of the clock. The updated value is a function of `cmd_clk_en` passed through some time constraint quantifier `#TCQ`. This ensures that the command validity is correctly timed with respect to the overall system clock.
