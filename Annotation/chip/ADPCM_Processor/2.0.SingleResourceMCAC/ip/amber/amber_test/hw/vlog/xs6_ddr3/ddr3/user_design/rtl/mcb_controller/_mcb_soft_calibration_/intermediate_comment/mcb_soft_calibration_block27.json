    "block_comment": "The block is a synchronization and delay counter, designed to count up to 200 microseconds, depending on the system's simulation status or the reset signal. The implementation uses a 16-bit binary counter that increments on each upward transition of 'UI_CLK' clock if the 'RST' isn't active and the maximum count isn't reached. On reset or when in simulation mode, the counter is set to '16h0' or '16h7FF0', respectively. The condition 'WAIT_200us_COUNTER[15]' checks if the maximum count is reached, following which the counter preserves its state until 'RST' is triggered."
