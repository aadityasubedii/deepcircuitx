Comment: 
This block of code implements a delay functionality for a signal `cas_n` with a delay interval specified by `BUS_DELAY`. The signal `cas_n` is assigned to `cas_n_in` after `BUS_DELAY` time units within an 'always' block that is triggered by any change in the `cas_n` signal. This is typically used in simulation models to mimic the physical propagation delay that occurs in actual hardware.
