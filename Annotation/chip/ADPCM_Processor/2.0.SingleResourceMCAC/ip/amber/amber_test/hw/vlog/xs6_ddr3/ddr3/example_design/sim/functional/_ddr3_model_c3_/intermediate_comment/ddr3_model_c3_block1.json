    "block_comment": "This block functions as a timing check mechanism, reacting on the positive edge of a Data Quantization System signal. It is implemented as an always block in Verilog, a concurrent block that is triggered whenever there's a positive edge at the 32nd bit of the 'dqs_in' input signal. Following this trigger, the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' is called for processing the final bit of the data line, thereby ensuring its correct timing. The trigger point is set to be the 32nd bit of the signal, following the binary numbering convention."
