    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code is responsible for resetting or incrementing a counter (`force_wrcmd_timeout_cnts`) based on certain conditions. Upon a positive edge of the clock signal (`clk_i`), if the reset signal (`rst_i[0]`) is high, or if both `wait_bl_end` is low and `wait_bl_end_r1` is high, the counter is reset to zero. However, if the `force_wrcmd_gen` signal is high, the counter is incremented by 1."
