    "block_comment": "This Verilog block manages the status of the user_bl_cnt_not_1 signal based on data_valid_i and user_bl_cnt_is_1 flags. When triggered by a positive edge of clk_i signal, if the data_valid_i signal and user_bl_cnt_is_1 flag are both high, it sets the user_bl_cnt_not_1 signal high with specified timing control (#TCQ). Otherwise, it drives this signal to a low state. The synchronous nature of the process ensures correct signal behavior in the context of a digital clock system."
