This block checks the calibration flag and accordingly assigns signals for the memory control blocks. If the calibration flag is set to false, it assigns a set of signal variables to corresponding user interface (UI) variables, and also sets DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL and selfrefresh_mode bits to 0. MCB_SYSRST is assigned a value based on the wait_200us_counter and int_sys_rst variables. One section of the block is only enabled if the simulation flag is false which suggests this block is part of an initialization sequence.
