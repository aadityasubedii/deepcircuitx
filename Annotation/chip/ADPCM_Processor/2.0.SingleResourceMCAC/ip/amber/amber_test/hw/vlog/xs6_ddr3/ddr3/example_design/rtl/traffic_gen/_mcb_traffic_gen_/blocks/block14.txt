Comment: 
The line of code assigns an address output (`addr_o`) to the MCB command address (`mcb_cmd_addr_o`). Specifically, it uses a bit-wise section of the `addr_o` array from `ADDR_WIDTH-1` down to `0`. The assignment via `assign` ensures that `mcb_cmd_addr_o` always tracks `addr_o`'s value in real-time, representing a completely combinational logic. This is typically used in memory command block (MCB) operations where it helps in directing commands to specific addresses.
