    "block_comment": "The function of this block of Verilog code is data generation (Data_GenW0), which takes an integer input (i), and generates a bit-string output of width equal to four times NUM_DQ_PINS. The output bit-string initially consists of all ones. The function then divides the input by 2 to determine an index (j). If the input is an odd number, specified portions of the bit-string, determined by the index and NUM_DQ_PINS value, are replaced with specific 8-bit patterns. If the input is even, different 8-bit patterns are used."
