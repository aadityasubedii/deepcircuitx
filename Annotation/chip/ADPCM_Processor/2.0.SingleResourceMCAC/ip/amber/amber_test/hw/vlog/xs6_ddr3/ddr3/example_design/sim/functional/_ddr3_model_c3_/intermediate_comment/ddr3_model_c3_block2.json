    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a data strobe timing check for data transfer synchronization. When there's a rising edge (positive edge) detected on the 31st bit (index 30 when starting at 0) of the 'dqs_in' signal, it triggers the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function with parameter 30, which may perform a relevant checking or synchronization process related to the current bit."
