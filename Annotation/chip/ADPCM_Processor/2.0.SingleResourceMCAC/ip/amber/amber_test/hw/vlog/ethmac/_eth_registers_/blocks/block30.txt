Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for assigning values to certain signal lines based on the state of the MIICOMMANDOut field. The values from specific bits of the MIICOMMANDOut field are assigned to the r_WCtrlData, r_RStat, and r_ScanStat signals. The r_WCtrlData signal retrieves its value from the third bit, r_RStat from the second bit, and r_ScanStat from the first bit of the MIICOMMANDOut.
