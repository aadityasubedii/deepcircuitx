Module name: xs6_addsub_n. 

Module specification: The 'xs6_addsub_n' Verilog module is a width-parameterizable arithmetic unit designed to perform either addition or subtraction based on the supplied operation mode. It utilizes the reconfigurable DSP48A1 block available in FPGA architecture for executing the arithmetic operations. The module has four inputs - 'i_a' and 'i_b', which are the operands and their widths are determined by a parameter 'WIDTH'; 'i_cin', the carry input that is significant for carry-forward operations; and 'i_sub', a flag signal that toggles between addition and subtraction operations. The results of the operations are provided through two outputs - 'o_sum' that represents the calculation result with width matching that of the operands, and 'o_co' that provides the carryout signal for following stages in cascaded modules. Internally, the module uses 'opmode' signal to set the operation mode of the DSP48A1, 'in_a' and 'in_b' as zero-padded extensions of the inputs 'i_a' and 'i_b' to align with DSP48A1 input requirements, and 'out' to deliver the output from the DSP block to the output ports. The DSP48A1 primitive is custom-configured to perform the specific task, divided into several subsections serving different parts of the main operation. Each input and output port, internal signal and code section thus plays a unique and crucial role, contributing to the overall functionality of the xs6_addsub_n Verilog module.
