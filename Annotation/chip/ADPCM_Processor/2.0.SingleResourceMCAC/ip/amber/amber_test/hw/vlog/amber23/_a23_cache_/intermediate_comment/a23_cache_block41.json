    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the write-enable control signal for a system tag. By selectively turning on the output based on the selected source, it enables writing to be performed when the source signal corresponds to \"C_INVA\", \"C_FILL\", or \"C_INIT\", and it prevents writing when the signal corresponds to \"C_CORE\". Other unlabelled sources are also defaulted to not having write access."
