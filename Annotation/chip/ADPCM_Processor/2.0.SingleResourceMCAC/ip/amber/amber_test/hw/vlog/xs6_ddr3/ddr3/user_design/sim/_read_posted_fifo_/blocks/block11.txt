Comment: 
The block of Verilog RTL code monitors if the data fifo has enough room. A check is performed each positive edge of the clock signal, using a clocked always block. If the buffer available register (`buf_avail_r`) has a value greater than or equal to 62, then the register `dfifo_has_enough_room` is set to 1, indicating that there's sufficient space in the data fifo. Otherwise, it's set to 0. The result is also stored in `dfifo_has_enough_room_d1` in the next clock cycle as that register is delayed by one clock cycle, which could be used for synchronizing processes in different clock domains.
