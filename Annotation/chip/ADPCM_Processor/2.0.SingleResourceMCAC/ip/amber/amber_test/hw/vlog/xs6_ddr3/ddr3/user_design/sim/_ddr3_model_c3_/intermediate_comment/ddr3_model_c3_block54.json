    "block_comment": "This block of code triggers a specific function whenever there's a positive edge on the 12th bit (index 11) of the signal array 'dqs_in'. The sensitivity to the positive edge indicates that when the bit flips from 0 to 1, the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function, with 11 as argument, gets executed."
