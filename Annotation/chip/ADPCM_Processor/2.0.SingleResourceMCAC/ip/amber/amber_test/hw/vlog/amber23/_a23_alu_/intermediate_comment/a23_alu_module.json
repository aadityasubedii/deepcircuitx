    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'a23_alu' module is an Arithmetic Logic Unit implemented in Verilog, equipped to perform arithmetic and logic operations determined by a 9-bit control input. It accepts two 32-bit inputs and two control bits from a Barrel Shifter and Status Register respectively, and outputs a 32-bit result and 4-bit status flags. Internal control signals (derived from the main control input) manage various operations including input swapping, bit-inversion, carry handling, overflow detection, as well as bitwise AND, OR, XOR operations, and sign or zero bit extension. Conditional logic supports specific operations with Xilinx FPGA."
