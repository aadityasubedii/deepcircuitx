    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code implements a ready command function (cmd_rdyD) that gets set in specific conditions based on input signals and events. Upon a positive clock (clk_i) edge, it checks for a reset signal (rst_i[0]). If the reset signal is active, then cmd_rdyD is set high with a delay of TCQ time units. Otherwise, it further checks for the start command signal (cmd_startD). If the start command is active and a certain condition depending on bl_i is met, cmd_rdyD is appropriately set. It also verifies a specific condition involving user_burst_cnt and fifo_not_full, and in such case, cmd_rdyD is set high, suggesting a ready state for the next command operations."
