    "block_comment": "The block activates a timing check for the 6th bit of the dq_in data queue. It monitors the changes in the 6th bit (dq_in[5]) and triggers the timing check function (dq_timing_check) instantly upon detecting any transition in the bit value. This checks and maintains appropriate timing for that specific bit in the data queue."
