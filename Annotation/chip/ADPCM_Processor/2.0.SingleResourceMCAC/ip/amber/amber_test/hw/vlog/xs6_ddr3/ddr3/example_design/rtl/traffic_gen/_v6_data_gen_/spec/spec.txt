Module name: v6_data_gen. Module specification: This module generates data patterns for memory testing, supporting various data widths (8 to 144 bits) and burst lengths. It can produce address-based, PRBS, walking 1/0, neighbor, hammer, and fixed data patterns. The module takes inputs like clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), data mode (data_mode_i), address (addr_i), and control signals (cmd_startA-E), and outputs generated test data (data_o). Internal signals include pattern-specific data (prbs_data, adata, hdata, ndata, w1data), counters (acounts), and control flags (data_valid, sel_w1gen_logic). The module is organized into sections for different data patterns, including PRBS generation, address-based patterns, walking 1/0 patterns, and neighbor
