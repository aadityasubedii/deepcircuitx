    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for detection of invalid command for write-only port 3. The implementation checks if the configuration of port C_PORT_CONFIG is set to \"W32\" and command enable 'p3_cmd_en' is true. Furthermore, it validates 'p3_cmd_instr[2]' is 0 and 'p3_cmd_instr[0]' is 1. If all these conditions meet, then an error message gets displayed and the program execution halts."
