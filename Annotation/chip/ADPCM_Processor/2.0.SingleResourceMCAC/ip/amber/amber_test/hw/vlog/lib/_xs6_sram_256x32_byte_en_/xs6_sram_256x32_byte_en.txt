Module-level comment: This module, xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en, serves as a 256x32 Single Dual Port (SDP) SRAM with byte enable. It uses the RAMB8BWER block for data storage and handles both read and write operations controlled by i_write_enable. It accepts 32-bit data, uses 8-bit addressing, and deploys a 4-bit signal for byte-wise writes. Internally, a write enable array, wea, controls byte-specific write operations. An initial block checks for correct parameter input. Four unused internal signals (nc31, nc32, nc33, nc22) are also present.
