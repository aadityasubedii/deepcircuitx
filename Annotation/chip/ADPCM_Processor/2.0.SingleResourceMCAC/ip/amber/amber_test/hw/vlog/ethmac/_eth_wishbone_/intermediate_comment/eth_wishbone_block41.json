    "block_comment": "This block of code implements synchronous reset functionality with a flip-flop to write received data to a FIFO buffer. When a positive edge in WB_CLK_I or Reset is detected, it triggers the reset case if Reset is high, setting WriteRxDataToFifoSync2 to 0. If Reset is not high, it's the non-reset case and the current state of WriteRxDataToFifoSync1 is assigned to WriteRxDataToFifoSync2. This design ensures data integrity during writing to FIFO in a synchronized manner."
