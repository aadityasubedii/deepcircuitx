Comment: 
This block of code corresponds to a clocked synchronous block which resets or updates certain parameters with the positive edge of a clock or reset signal. If a reset signal arises, then the parameters - mem_read_data_r, mem_read_data_valid_r, and mem_load_rd_r - are all reset to the value zero. However, if the conditions of the absence of a write back stop signal or the presence of a memory stall signal are met, the parameters are updated with new values obtained from - mem_read_data_c, mem_load_rd_c, and mem_read_data_valid_c.
