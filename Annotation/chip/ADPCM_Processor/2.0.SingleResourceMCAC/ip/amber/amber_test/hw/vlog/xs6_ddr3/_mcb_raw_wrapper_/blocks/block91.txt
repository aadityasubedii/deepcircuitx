This block of code monitors the condition of port 3. If specific conditions are met, which include the C_PORT_CONFIG being set to "R32", the enable signal for the port 3 command (p3_cmd_en) being high, and the two specified bits in p3_cmd_instr being low, the block performs an error action. The implementation consists of an always block that triggers upon any change to its sensitivity list, with a conditioned error action that consists of a display function for error reporting and a finish function to stop the code execution.
