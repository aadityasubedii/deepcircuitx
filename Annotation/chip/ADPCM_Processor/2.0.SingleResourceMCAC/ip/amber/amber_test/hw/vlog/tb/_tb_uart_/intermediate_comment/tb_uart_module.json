    "module": "Module-level comment: The tb_uart module operates as a testbench for a UART, enabling data transmission and reception along with supporting loopback tests. It uses control signals through dedicated input and output ports - i_uart_cts_n and i_uart_rxd for reception, and o_uart_txd and o_uart_rts_n for transmission. Internal signals like clk_uart, clk_uart_rst_n, rx_byte, tx_byte, and their accompanying controls and counters govern the timing and data flow mechanisms. The module handles different transmission and reception states via its 'always' blocks which are triggered by the clock edges.  It also has provision to manage transmission queue overflows, ensuring robust operation."
