Comment: 
The block of code is used for resetting the input-output interfacing (IOI) in a DDR3 memory type architecture. It uses an OSERDES2 module instance 'ioi_rst_0' to implement serial/deserialization operations. Different parameters are set to specify the data rate, output mode, and the working mode of the SERDES. The 'ioi_rst' is the output while 'rst_90', 'pll_ce_0', 'pll_lock', and 'int_sys_rst' are inputs. IOI operation is synchronized with the 'ioclk0' clock signal. Extra configurations are applied to the block such as the shiftout lines being left unconnected, and certain data lines being held at constant zero logic. The block is activated only when 'C_MEM_TYPE' is set to 'DDR3'.
