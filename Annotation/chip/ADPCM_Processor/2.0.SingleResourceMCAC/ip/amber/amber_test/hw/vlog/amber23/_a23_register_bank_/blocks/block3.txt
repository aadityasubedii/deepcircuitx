Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is essentially a multiplexer (MUX). Its function is to assign the output 'o_rd' from a selection of inputs based on the value of the input 'i_rds_sel'. The input 'i_rds_sel' is used as a select signal to determine which of the inputs (r0_out to r14_rds) is assigned to the output 'o_rd'. The MUX is implemented using a case statement which assigns the respective input to the output depending on the value of 'i_rds_sel'. If 'i_rds_sel' is not any value from 4'd0 to 4'd14, the output 'o_rd' is assigned the value of 'r15_out_rm_nxt' by default.
