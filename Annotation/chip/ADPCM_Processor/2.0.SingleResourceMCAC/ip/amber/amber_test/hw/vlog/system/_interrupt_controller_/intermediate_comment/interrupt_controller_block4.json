    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for generating interrupts. Initially, it forms four different interrupt signals based on the raw interrupt inputs, software interrupt registers, and the respective enable registers. Then, it combines each interrupt with an additional interrupt, for test conditions in the case of the first set, by performing a bitwise OR reduction operation. Finally, it aggregates the interrupt signals and test signals from the two channels using bitwise OR operation, resulting in two final output interrupt signals."
