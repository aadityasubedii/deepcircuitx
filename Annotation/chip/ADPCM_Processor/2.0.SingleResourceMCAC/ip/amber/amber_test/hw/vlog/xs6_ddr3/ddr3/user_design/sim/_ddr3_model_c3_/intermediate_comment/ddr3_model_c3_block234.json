    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a flip-flop that is used to capture the change in the `ck_in` signal with respect to the rising edge of the same signal. Implemented using an `always` block, this code activates on a positive edge (`posedge`) of the input clock signal (`ck_in`). It saves the latest value of the `ck_in` signal to the `diff_ck` signal. Thus, it acts as a capture module which catches the momentary states of an input signal upon clock ticks, enabling the monitoring of `ck_in` signal transitions."
