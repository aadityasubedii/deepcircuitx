    "module": "Module-level comment: The read_posted_fifo module serves as a Read Posted FIFO handling sequential data transmission using input/output ports and internal signals/counters. It employs parameters like address width, burst length width, and TCQ for timing control. Key operations include data/command validity check, addressing, data buffering, and enabling read/write operations in synchronization with the clock signal. This module uses several always blocks for condition-based control management at each clock cycle alongside an instance of an asynchronous FIFO module, afifo, for read operations."
