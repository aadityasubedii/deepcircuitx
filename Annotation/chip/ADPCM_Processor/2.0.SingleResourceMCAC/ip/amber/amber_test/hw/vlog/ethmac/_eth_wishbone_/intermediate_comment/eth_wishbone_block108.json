    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a sequential flip-flop that's synchronized to a Wishbone (WB) clock (WB_CLK_I) signal or a reset signal. The flip-flop either holds the value of 'LatchValidBytes' until the next positive edge of the WB clock, or goes to a default state (0) when a reset signal is invoked. This is achieved via a conditional statement where in case of a reset, the variable 'LatchValidBytes_q' is set to 0 with a delay of 'Tp' simulation time, otherwise, it copies the value of 'LatchValidBytes' with the same delay."
