Comment: 
This line of Verilog code represents a hardware block that executes a timing check function whenever there is a change in the 20th bit of the dq_in data bus. The code employs the always@ construct which renders the block sensitive to changes in the mentioned bit, thereby triggering the dq_timing_check function with the number 19 as a parameter when the bit value changes. The function dq_timing_check presumably performs some form of timing verification or adjustment correlated to the 20th bit in the dq_in data bus.
