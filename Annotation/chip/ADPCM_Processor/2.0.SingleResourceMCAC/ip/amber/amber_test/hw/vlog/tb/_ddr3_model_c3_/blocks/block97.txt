Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for calling a function `dq_timing_check` every time the 34th bit (index 33) of the `dq_in` bus changes. Details of this block's implementation consist of the `always` keyword which sets a continuous monitor on the 34th bit of the `dq_in` data bus. The moment there's a change detected, it triggers the `dq_timing_check` function call with '33' as its argument.
