Comment: 
The block of code handles the state of the 'first_load_pulse' signal in a synchronous digital circuit, based on the state of the reset signal 'rst_i' and the mode signal 'mode_load_pulse'. When a rising edge is detected on the clock signal 'clk_i', the code checks if 'rst_i' is high; if so, it sets 'first_load_pulse' to high after a delay of 'TCQ' time units. If 'rst_i' is not high, but 'mode_load_pulse' is, it sets 'first_load_pulse' to low after the delay. If neither 'rst_i' nor 'mode_load_pulse' is high, it keeps the value of 'first_load_pulse' unchanged.
