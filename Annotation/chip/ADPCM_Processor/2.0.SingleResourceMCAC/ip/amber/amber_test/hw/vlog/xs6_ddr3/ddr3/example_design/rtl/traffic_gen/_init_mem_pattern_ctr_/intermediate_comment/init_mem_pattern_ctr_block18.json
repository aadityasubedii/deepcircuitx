    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning a value to the 7-bit-wide wire 'FIXED_BL_VALUE' based on the family of the target FPGA and the memory burst length (MEM_BURST_LEN). The code checks if the family is \"VIRTEX6\" and if the memory burst length is either 8 or 0. If both conditions are met, 'FIXED_BL_VALUE' is assigned a value of 2. If only the family condition is met and the memory burst length is 4, 'FIXED_BL_VALUE' is assigned a value of 1. If none of these conditions is met, 'FIXED_BL_VALUE' is assigned the value of 'FIXEDBL'. This process is implemented using conditional ternary operators."
