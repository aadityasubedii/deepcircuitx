This block serves the function of writing hexadecimal data into a file but drops leading zeros. It sequentially checks and extracts bits from the most to least significant nibble (four bits), then writes the hexadecimal equivalent of the truncated number to a file, essentially eliminating unnecessary leading zeros. This is accomplished via control flow statements examining each nibble of input in a descending order and invoking a write operation once it encounters a non-zero nibble.
