Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages a flag `TxUnderRun` to indicate a transmission underrun in a synchronous system. On each rising edge of `MTxClk` or a positive `Reset`, the code block investigates the status of the system. If a reset event occurs or the `BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync2` flag is set, the `TxUnderRun` flag is cleared. However, if the `TxUnderRun_sync1` flag is detected, it will set the `TxUnderRun` flag; this is likely to indicate that a data underflow situation has occurred, where the system attempted to read data but none was available, triggering a transmit underrun event.
