The block is a configuration condition for defining data transfer specifics to/from an MIG (Memory Interface Generator) memory block, aligned with a "B32" to "W32" interface matching. If the condition is met and port 3 is enabled, various signals related to the write operation are assigned respective port 3 signals such as clock, data, mask, enable, and status flags. If port 3 isn't enabled, these signals are grounded to zero. For both cases, the read signals like overflow, error, full, and empty are defaulted to zero.
