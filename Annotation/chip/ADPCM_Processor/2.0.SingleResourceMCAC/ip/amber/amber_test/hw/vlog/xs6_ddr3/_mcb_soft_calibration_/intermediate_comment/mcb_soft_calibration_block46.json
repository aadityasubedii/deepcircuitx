    "block_comment": "This block manages I/O control states. It primarily waits till the IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N signal is deasserted implying readiness. In addition to this primary function, it checks for the deassertion of ZIO_IN or maximum counts of N_Term, and based on the value of PNSKEW, it transitions the state between 'SKEW' or 'WAIT_FOR_START_BROADCAST'."
