    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential logic that updates the status of the `DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL` signal. It is executed at the positive edge of the `UI_CLK` signal. The `DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL` signal is set to high only when `DQS_DELAY_INITIAL` is not equal to 8'b00 or when `STATE` equates to `DONE`, and `MCB_UODONECAL` is asserted. The block utilizes and combines these conditions to create a single output that depends on these variables."
