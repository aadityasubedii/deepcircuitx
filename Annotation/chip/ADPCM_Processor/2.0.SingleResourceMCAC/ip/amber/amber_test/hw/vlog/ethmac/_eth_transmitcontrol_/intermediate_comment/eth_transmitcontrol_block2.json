    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a multiplexer responsible for selecting the data to be assigned to the 'MuxedCtrlData' register based on the value of 'ByteCnt'. The block uses the 'ByteCnt' register to index through different byte sections of the 'MAC' and 'TxPauseTV' registers, as well as applying specific hard-coded byte values, depending on the 'ByteCnt' value. If 'ByteCnt' equals zero, the block will perform bitwise operations with 'DlyCrcEn' and 'DlyCrcCnt' to decide which byte value to assign to 'MuxedCtrlData'. For other 'ByteCnt' values, the block will assign either slices from 'MAC' or 'TxPauseTV', or hard-coded byte values to 'MuxedCtrlData'. If none of these cases apply, the 'default' section sets 'MuxedCtrlData' to zero."
