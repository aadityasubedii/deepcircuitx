This block of code checks the timing of command addresses in a digital design. The function `cmd_addr_timing_check` is called whenever there is any change in the 9th bit (index 8) of the input address signal `addr_in`. This is done using an `always` block, which is a fundamental construct of the Verilog language that schedules evaluations based on the changes of its sensitivity list, in this case `addr_in[8]`. Therefore, any variable change in the 9th bit of `addr_in` will trigger the timing check for the specific command address (15).
