    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to synchronize the TxStartFrm_wb signal with the MTxClk clock. The synchronization is performed in such a way that the TxStartFrm_sync1 register is reset when the Reset signal is high. However, during the positive edge of the MTxClk clock or when Reset is inactive, the TxStartFrm_sync1 register is updated with the TxStartFrm_wb value following a delay specified by Tp."
