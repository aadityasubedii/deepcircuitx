    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is essentially a clock-edge sensitive register that updates the memory address based on certain conditions. Upon detecting a rising edge of the clock signal, the block first checks if there is a command start signal (`cmd_startD`). If there is, it immediately obtains the address from the input signal `addr_i` following a delay defined by `#TCQ`. In the absence of this start signal, it checks for readiness signals from the FIFO and data, as well as the user burst count. If these conditions are met, depending on the value of data width (`DWIDTH`), it incrementally advances the address by steps of 16,8, or 4."
