Comment: 
This line of code outputs the current state of the Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) generator. It achieves this by using the 'assign' keyword which is a continuous assignment statement in Verilog used to drive nets with continuous statements. The assigned output 'prbs_o' is set to the current value of the 'prbs' variable.
