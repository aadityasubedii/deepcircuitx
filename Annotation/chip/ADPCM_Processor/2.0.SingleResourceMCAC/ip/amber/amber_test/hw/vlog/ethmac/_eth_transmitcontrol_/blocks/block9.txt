Comment: 
The block controls the delay Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) count operation. It resets the DlyCrcCnt on both the positive edge transmission reset (TxReset) and the reset byte count (ResetByteCnt). If there is no reset command, but there's an increase flag (IncrementDlyCrcCnt), the DlyCrcCnt is incremented. The operation initialization or increment is delayed by the amount specified in 'Tp'.
