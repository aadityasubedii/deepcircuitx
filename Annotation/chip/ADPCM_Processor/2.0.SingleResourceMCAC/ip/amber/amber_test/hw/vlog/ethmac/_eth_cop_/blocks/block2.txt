Comment: 
The block of code handles error display and diagnosis in the case of either 's1' or 's2' Wishbone protocol activities. It uses a counter (`cnt`) to track the number of clock cycles, triggering a series of diagnostic messages if the counter reaches 1000 without expected Wishbone actions (`s1_wb_cyc_o` or `s2_wb_cyc_o`). The value of relevant parameters, such as data, address, select information, and write enable status, are output for troubleshooting and error analysis. The code stops execution after messages are displayed.
