    "block_comment": "The block of code acts as a trigger for a method that implements a timing check on the DQ input signal. When the 60th bit of the DQ input signal toggles, the procedure 'dq_timing_check' of index 59 is invoked, serving as a mechanism to monitor and validate the timing of the DQ signals at a specific point within a larger system architecture or design."
