Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for checking whether the received data is correct or not. It operates at the positive edge of "MRxClk" signal and after a propagation delay of 'Tp' in which a bitwise AND operation is performed between the first bit of 'StateData' and 'ByteCntEq6' to generate 'CrcHashGood' signal.
