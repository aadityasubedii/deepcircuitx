    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code oversees data transmission and acknowledgment signals for two slave devices S1 and S2 from a master device M1. Upon signalling an active transmission ('m1_in_progress'), the code checks if the addressed slave is S1 or S2 (`M1_ADDRESSED_S1 or `M1_ADDRESSED_S2), and accordingly assigns respective data (`s1_wb_dat_i/s2_wb_dat_i`) and acknowledgment signals (`s1_wb_ack_i/s2_wb_ack_i`) to the master's output. If no transmission is in progress, the acknowledgment output from the master is reset to zero."
