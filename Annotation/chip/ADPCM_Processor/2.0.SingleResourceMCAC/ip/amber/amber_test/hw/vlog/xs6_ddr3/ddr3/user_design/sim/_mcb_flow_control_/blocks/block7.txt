This block of Verilog code implements a command, address and byte length register that triggers updates on the rising edge of an incoming clock signal when a push command is given. The registers cmd_reg, addr_reg, and bl_reg get updated with the values of cmd_i, addr_i, and bl_i (with a delay of #TCQ and bl_i decremented by 1) respectively.
