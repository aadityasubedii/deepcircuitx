    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is used for debugging purposes. It calculates and displays the current UART bit pulse period by utilizing pre-calculated clock periods and bit pulse counts plus adjustments. It also displays the desired UART word period and specific details about the bit pulse count and bit adjustment counts. Moreover, these calculations and display operations are carried out at the initialization stage of RTL execution using the 'initial' keyword."
