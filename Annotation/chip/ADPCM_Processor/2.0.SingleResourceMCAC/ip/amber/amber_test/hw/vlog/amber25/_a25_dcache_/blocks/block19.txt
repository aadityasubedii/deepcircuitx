This block of Verilog code defines a function `pick_way` that selects a way based on valid bits and a random number. It takes two inputs: an array `valid_bits` and a 4-bit number `random_num`. The function checks the lowest two valid bits. If the first is 0, it sets `pick_way` to '01'; if the first is not 0 and the second is, it sets `pick_way` to '10'. If both are non-zero, it then does a case-select based on the 3 upper bits of the `random_num`, once again returning either '10' or '01', implementing a sort of pseudo-random policy.
