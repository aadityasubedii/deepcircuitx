    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a timing check on the 16th bit of the input data (dm_in). Specifically, the check is triggered whenever there's a change in the value of the 16th bit of dm_in. The implementation is handled by the function called dm_timing_check, with 15 as a parameter indicating that the relevant bit index is 15 (the 16th bit, considering 0-based indexing)."
