The block of code manages a write operation in progress flag. It enables or resets the 'wr_in_progress' flag depending on the conditions satisfied. On every rising edge of the clock, if the reset signal 'rst_i' or if 'last_word_wr_i' (indicating the last word has been written) are asserted, it resets the 'wr_in_progress' to 0. The flag is set back to 1 only when the 'current_state' is 'WRITE'. The delays marked by '#TCQ' represent a Timing Control Quantity specific to the hardware.
