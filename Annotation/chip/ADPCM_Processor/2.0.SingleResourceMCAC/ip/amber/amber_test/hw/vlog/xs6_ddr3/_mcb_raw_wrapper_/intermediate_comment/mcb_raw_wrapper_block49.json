    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code configures signals related to memory interface operation such as read/write clock, command instructions, and bloc lengths. It conditionally assigns write enable signals based on the user interface mode. It assigns `mig_p2_cmd_instr` and `mig_p2_cmd_bl` to `p1_cmd_instr` and a formed vector from `p1_cmd_instr` and `p1_cmd_bl` respectively. It also assigns the read and write clocks to `mig_p2_clk`, `mig_p3_clk`, `mig_p4_clk`, and `mig_p5_clk`. Crucially, it manages the enabled states for write operations using flags `mig_p3_en` and `mig_p5_en`, controlled by both the `p1_wr_en` (write-enable signal) and the defined user interface mode. Lastly, it assigns `p1_wr_data` to `mig_p3_wr_data` for later memory write operations."
