    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronous logic for reducing signal glitches. This logic works on the rising edge of MRxClk. Within this block, the signal 'Busy_IRQ_sync2' is delayed by a time period 'Tp' before being assigned to 'Busy_IRQ_syncb1'. Subsequently, 'Busy_IRQ_syncb1' is similarly delayed before being assigned to 'Busy_IRQ_syncb2'. This way, the original signal 'Busy_IRQ_sync2' cascades through two registers, reducing signal glitches with a total delay of 2*Tp."
