    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'a25_mem' module serves as the memory interface for a processor system, managing memory operations and cache control. It uses input ports for data processing and control signals (like clk, reset, i_fetch_stall) and output ports to communicate data status and operations. Internally, several signals manage the cache and pipeline stalls. A key section of the code integrates the a25_dcache module for efficient cache operations. The functionality is achieved through sequential and combinational logic coded in the Verilog RTL."
