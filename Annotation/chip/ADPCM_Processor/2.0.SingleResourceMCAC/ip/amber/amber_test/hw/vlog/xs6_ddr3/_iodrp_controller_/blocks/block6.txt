Comment: 
This block of code performs a synchronous reset and data reading function on a positive edge of the DRP_CLK signal. Upon the rise of the DRP_CLK signal, if a synchronous reset ('sync_rst') is detected, the 'read_data' register is reset to a default value of 8'h00. Otherwise, if the system state is indicated as 'ALMOST_READY', the 'read_data' register attains the value of the 'shift_through_reg' register.
