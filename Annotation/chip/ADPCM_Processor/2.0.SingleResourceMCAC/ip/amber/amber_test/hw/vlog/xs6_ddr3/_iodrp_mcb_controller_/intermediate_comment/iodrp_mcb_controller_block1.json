    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a system state update mechanism. When a positive edge of the DRP_CLK signal is detected, if a synchronous reset (sync_rst) is observed, the system state (state) is set to READY, else it continues as the 'nextstate'. This forms a state machine architecture which allows the system to either reset to a default 'READY' state or progress according to a predefined state transition 'nextstate'."
