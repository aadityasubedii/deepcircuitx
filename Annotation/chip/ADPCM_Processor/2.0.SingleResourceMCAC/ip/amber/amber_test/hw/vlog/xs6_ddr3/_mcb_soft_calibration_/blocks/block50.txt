Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for updating the P_Term and STATE variable. It uses the `Mult_Divide` function on the current `P_Term` value, subtracted by one, with `MULT` and `DIV` as input variables to calculate the new `P_Term`. After which, it sets the `STATE` variable to `LOAD_ZIO_PTERM`, presumably to designate the next state of the system.
