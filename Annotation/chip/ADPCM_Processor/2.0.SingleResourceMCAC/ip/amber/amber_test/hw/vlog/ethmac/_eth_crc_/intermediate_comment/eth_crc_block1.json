    "block_comment": "The code block performs a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) error detection. It does this by taking a 32-bit subsection of the 'Crc' variable, from bit 31 to bit 0, and compares it to a constant hexadecimal value ('c704dd7b'). If there is a mismatch, 'CrcError' is assigned the value of '1' indicating an error, otherwise '0', signifying no error."
