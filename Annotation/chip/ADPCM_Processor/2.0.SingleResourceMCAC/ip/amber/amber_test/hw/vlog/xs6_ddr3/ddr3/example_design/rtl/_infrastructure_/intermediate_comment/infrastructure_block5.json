    "block_comment": "This block handles a system reset signal for a phase-locked loop (PLL) module within a synchronous clock management system. Specifically, it conditionally manages the state of 'syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked' based on the system reset 'sys_rst' and the PLL locked state 'bufpll_mcb_locked'. When a system reset occurs ('sys_rst' is high), the block resets 'syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked' to 0. Else, if the PLL has locked onto the input clock ('bufpll_mcb_locked' is high), it sets 'syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked' to 1 indicating a powered-up and synchronously locked state."
