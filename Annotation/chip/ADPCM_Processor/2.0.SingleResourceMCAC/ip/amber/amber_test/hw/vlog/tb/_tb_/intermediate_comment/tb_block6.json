    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code assigns the value of a system-level signal to a local signal within the current module. The system-level signal is referenced using a macro syntax, indicating its value comes from an upper level of hierarchy. Specifically, it assigns the value from the test_status_set signal in the U_TEST_MODULE to the local test_status_set signal."
