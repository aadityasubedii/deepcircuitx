    "block_comment": "This block of code uses an always block to continuously monitor the positive edge of the `dqs_in[6]` signal. When a positive edge is detected at the 6th index of `dqs_in`, the `dqs_pos_timing_check(6)` procedure is invoked. This procedure is designed to perform a timing check specifically for the indicated index. This block heavily relies on the event-driven feature of Verilog, and specifically checks for a transition from low to high voltage level at `dqs_in[6]`."
