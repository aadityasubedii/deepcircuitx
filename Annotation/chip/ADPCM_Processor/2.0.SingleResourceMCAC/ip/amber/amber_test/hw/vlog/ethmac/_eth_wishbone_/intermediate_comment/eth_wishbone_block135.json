    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the 'BlockingTxBDRead' signal with respect to 'StartTxBDRead' and 'TxBDReady' signals under the clock 'WB_CLK_I' and 'Reset' conditions. On a positive edge of 'Reset', 'BlockingTxBDRead' is set to 0 (disabled). However, on a positive edge of 'WB_CLK_I', if 'StartTxBDRead' occurs, 'BlockingTxBDRead' is set to 1 (enabled). But if there's no 'StartTxBDRead' and 'TxBDReady' both are not active (low), 'BlockingTxBDRead' is set back to 0. This block essentially works as a simple state machine for managing 'BlockingTxBDRead' based on conditions."
