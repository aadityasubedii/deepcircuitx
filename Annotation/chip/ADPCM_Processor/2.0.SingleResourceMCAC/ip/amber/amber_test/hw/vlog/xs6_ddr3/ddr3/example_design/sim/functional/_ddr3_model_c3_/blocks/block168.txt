Comment: 
The block of code checks the timing of write enable signals using the function `cmd_addr_timing_check()`. It checks if the write enable negative signal `we_n_in` has a good timing and stable condition during the write operation. The function `cmd_addr_timing_check(3)` is invoked with an argument of '3' whenever the `we_n_in` signal changes, which is orchestrated using the keyword `always`.
