Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for outputting a signal (`data_valid_o`) indicating if the data is valid and if the FIFO buffer is not full. The statement does this by performing a bitwise AND operation (`&`) on two signals: `data_valid`, which indicates if the current data is valid, and `fifo_not_full`, which shows if the FIFO buffer is not full. If both of these conditions are true (`1`), `data_valid_o` will also be true (`1`), otherwise, it will be false (`0`).
