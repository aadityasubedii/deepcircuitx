Module-level comment: The `eth_rxethmac` module is an Ethernet Receiver MAC performing decoding and validation of incoming Ethernet data. It accepts raw ethernet data, clock signals, reset, and configuration inputs which define MAC address, frame length, and other key parameters. Through specific submodules like the state machine (`rxstatem1`), counters (`rxcounters1`), data and address checking (`rxaddrcheck1` and `eth_crc`), it segments and validates packet data. The module outputs segmented data, byte count information, state indications, and error signals, useful for subsequent processing and network interfacing.
