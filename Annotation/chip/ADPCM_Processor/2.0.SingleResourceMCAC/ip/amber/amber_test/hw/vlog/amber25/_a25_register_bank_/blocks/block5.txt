Comment: 
This block of code performs a multiplexer (MUX) operation, selectively assigning the output `o_rm` based on the input `i_rm_sel`. This operation is achieved by using conditional (ternary) operations, comparing `i_rm_sel` to different 4 bit values from `4'd0` to `4'd14`, and assigns `o_rm` the corresponding `rx_out` value for matching cases. For any other value of `i_rm_sel`, `o_rm` will default to `r15_out_rm`.
