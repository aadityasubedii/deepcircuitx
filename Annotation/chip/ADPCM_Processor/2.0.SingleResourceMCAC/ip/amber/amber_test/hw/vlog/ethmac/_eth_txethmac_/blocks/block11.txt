Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for the state-dependent assignment of the 4-bit output `MTxD_d`. Therein, it checks the state flags `StateData`, `StateFCS`, `StateJam`, `StatePreamble` and sets `MTxD_d` correspondingly based on the state and certain conditions. In `StateData` mode, data is extracted from `TxData` and assigned to `MTxD_d`. In `StateFCS` mode, it inverses the top four bits of `Crc` and assigns them to `MTxD_d`. For `StateJam` state, it simply assigns hexadecimal 9 to `MTxD_d`. Importantly, in `StatePreamble`, `MTxD_d` is set to hexadecimal 'D' or '5' depending on whether `NibCntEq15` (a condition relating to the bit count) is true - 'D' if true, '5' otherwise. If none of the conditions are met, `MTxD_d` defaults to 0's.
