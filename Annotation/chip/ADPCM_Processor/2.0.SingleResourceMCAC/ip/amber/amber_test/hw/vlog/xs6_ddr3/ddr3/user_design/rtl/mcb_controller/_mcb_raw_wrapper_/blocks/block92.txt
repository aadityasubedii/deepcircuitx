Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code generates an internal system reset signal (int_sys_rst). It takes the OR operation between a system reset signal (sys_rst) and the negation of gated phase-locked loop lock signal (~gated_pll_lock). When either the system is reset (sys_rst signal being high) or the PLL lock is not completed (gated_pll_lock is false, thereby making ~gated_pll_lock true), the internal system is forced to a reset state (int_sys_rst becomes high).
