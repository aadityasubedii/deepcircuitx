    "block_comment": "This block sets the handling of interrupt requests and data aborts in a processing unit. Upon each positive edge of the input clock, and no stall on fetch, interrupt and fast-interrupt requests are updated according to input values. In addition, if the control state is labeled as \"INT_WAIT1\" and the mode of status bits is \"SVC\", the data abort register is reset. Otherwise, a logic OR operation is performed between the existing data abort register and the input data abort value. The resultant value of the data abort register is subsequently delayed by one clock cycle."
