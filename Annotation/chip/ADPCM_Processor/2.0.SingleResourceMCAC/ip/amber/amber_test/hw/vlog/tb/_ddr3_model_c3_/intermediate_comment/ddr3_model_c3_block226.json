The 'number' passed to this function can be a real value. If the decimal number of the 'number' is greater than 0, the floor value is calculated by converting the float number to integer by using `$rtoi` function and then subtracting 1; on the contrary, if 'number' is an integer, it just returns the 'number' as it is, offering a customized floor operation."
