The number of data items it can store (i.e., the depth of the FIFO) and the width of the data are both parameterizable. The module includes input flags to handle write and read operations, as well as to reset or clear the FIFO. It provides outputs that indicate its current status, such as empty, full, almost empty, and almost full. The module utilizes separate write and read pointers to address memory locations, ensuring proper sequencing of data input and output. Depending on the hardware configuration (i.e., if it's a Xilinx Spartan6 FPGA or not), it may use distributed memory in FPGA for data storage. The module handles write and read operations only when the FIFO is not full or empty, respectively, and update the pointer and counter accordingly. The module includes delay gates (`#Tp`) for timing control to simulate propagation delays."
