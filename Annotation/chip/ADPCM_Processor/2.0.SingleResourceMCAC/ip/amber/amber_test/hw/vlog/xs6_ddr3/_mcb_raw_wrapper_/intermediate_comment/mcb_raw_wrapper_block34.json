    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a synchronous design for a CKE (Clock Enable) signal training mechanism in Verilog. It toggles `cke_train_reg` signal based on the system reset `int_sys_rst` and two additional training conditions. On a positive edge of `ui_clk` or high `int_sys_rst`, it resets `cke_train_reg` to `0`. If training is still in process, i.e., `wait_200us_done_r1` is high and `wait_200us_done_r2` is low, it sets `cke_train_reg` to `1`. Once training completes as indicated by `uo_done_cal`, it again sets `cke_train_reg` to `0`."
