The given block is responsible for capturing DQS (data strobe) signals on the positive edge of an odd DQS signal at position 13. The implementation is an 'always' block in Verilog which utilizes a procedural method for this operation. Whenever a positive transition occurs in the DQS signal at position 13 (dqs_odd[13]), the procedure 'dqs_odd_receiver' for position 13 is triggered.
