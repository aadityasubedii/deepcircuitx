    "block_comment": "This block manages the selection of received bytes based on the reset state of the LSB Rx pointer. It employs a case statement to decode the reset state, where the decoder outputs (RxByteSel[3:0]) are determined by the two least significant bits of RxPointerLSB_rst. Depending on the binary value (from '0' to '3'), the output sets to 'f', '7', '3', '1' respectively to select different bytes."
