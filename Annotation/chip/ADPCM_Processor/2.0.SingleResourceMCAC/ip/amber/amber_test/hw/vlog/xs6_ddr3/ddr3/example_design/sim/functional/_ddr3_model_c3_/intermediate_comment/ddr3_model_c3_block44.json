    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a delay-locked loop, specifically designed to track the timing of the negative edge of the `dqs_in[21]` signal. It utilizes the `always @` command to continuously monitor the specified signal edge, and upon detection, invokes the `dqs_pos_timing_check(21)` function. The approach provides accurate real-time tracking of signal changes, contributing to the robust synchrony of hardware components."
