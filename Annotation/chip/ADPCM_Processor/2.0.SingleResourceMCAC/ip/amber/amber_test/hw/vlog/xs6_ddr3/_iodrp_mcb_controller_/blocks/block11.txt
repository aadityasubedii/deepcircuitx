This block is primarily used for data output multiplexing based on the address value of 'drp_ioi_addr'. It handles data output for various addresses related to IOI DQs, UDQS CLK, UDQS PIN, LDQS CLK, LDQS PIN. Each case assignment handles a specific address and decides if the data output needs to be shifted. For certain IOI_DQ addresses conditionally, it can shift the data output to left by 1, given the macro DRP_v1_0_FIX is defined. The default case handles any other address not specified by assigning the unshifted data_out to the data_out_mux.
