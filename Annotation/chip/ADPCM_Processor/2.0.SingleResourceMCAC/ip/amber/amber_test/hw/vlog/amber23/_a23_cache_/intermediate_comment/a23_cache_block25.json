    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code inaugurates a label named \"valid_bits_3ways\" that is initiated when the condition where the variable 'WAYS' equals to 3 is met. The use of the 'begin' keyword suggests an encapsulation of a series of procedural statements or blocks, subject to the conditional 'if' statement, under this declared unique label. The specific functionality within this block or the operations that are performed aren't provided in the snippet. Normally, this structure is used for handling specific operation modes or states in hardware modelling and design. Therefore, you're tasked to provide a detailed view of the logic both within and surrounding this block for a more precise and comprehensive comment."
