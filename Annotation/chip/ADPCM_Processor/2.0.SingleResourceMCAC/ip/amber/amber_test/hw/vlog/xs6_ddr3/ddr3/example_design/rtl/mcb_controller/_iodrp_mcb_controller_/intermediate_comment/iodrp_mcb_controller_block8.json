    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the increment and reset of the variable 'bit_cnt'. The block monitors for a positive edge (rising edge) of 'DRP_CLK'. When such an edge is detected, it checks if the 'state' is either 'ADDR_PHASE' or 'DATA_PHASE' and 'sync_rst' is false. If this is true, 'bit_cnt' gets incremented by 1. Otherwise, 'bit_cnt' gets reset to 0."
