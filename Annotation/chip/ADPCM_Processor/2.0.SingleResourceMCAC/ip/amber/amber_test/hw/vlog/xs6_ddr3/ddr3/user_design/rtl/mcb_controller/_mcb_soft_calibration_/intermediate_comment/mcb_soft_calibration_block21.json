    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for generating a reset condition, `non_violating_rst`, which is a logical AND operation of 'RST' and 'Rst_condition1'. The reset condition is asserted when both `RST` (a possible global reset signal) and `Rst_condition1` (which could be a local condition for reset) are high. As it is an assign statement, it continuously checks the status of 'RST' and 'Rst_condition1', therefore creating a dynamic non-blocking reset condition."
