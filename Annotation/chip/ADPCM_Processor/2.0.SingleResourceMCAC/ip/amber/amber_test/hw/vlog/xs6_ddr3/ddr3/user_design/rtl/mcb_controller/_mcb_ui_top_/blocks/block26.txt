Comment: 
The function `calc_num_time_slots` calculates the number of time slots for a particular configuration of ports. It does this based on the enabled ports (`port_enable`) and a configuration mode (`port_config`). The function starts with a count of enabled ports, incrementing for each enabled port. If the configuration mode is 1 and there are 5 enabled ports, the function designates 10 time slots. Otherwise, it designates 12 time slots.
