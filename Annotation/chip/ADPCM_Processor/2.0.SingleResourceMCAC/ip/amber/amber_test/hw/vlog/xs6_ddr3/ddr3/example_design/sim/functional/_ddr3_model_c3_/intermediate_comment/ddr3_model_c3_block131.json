    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for the timing check in a communication/data line, identified as 'dq'. It uses a 'dqs_in_valid' signal to trigger the checks, verifying that both the setup and hold time constraints are met. It monitors potential violations by comparing current time with the pre-captured timestamp i.e., 'tm_dqs' for data hold time and 'tm_dq' for input pulse width violation, and generates an error message if these conditions aren't met. It also resets the check_dq_tdipw flag for the 'i-th' bit after it's done."
