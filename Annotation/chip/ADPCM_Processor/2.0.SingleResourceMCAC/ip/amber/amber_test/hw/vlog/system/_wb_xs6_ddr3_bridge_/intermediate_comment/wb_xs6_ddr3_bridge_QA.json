The purpose of the bridge is to facilitate the conversion of WB bus protocols (which could be a CPU or a peripheral device) to DDR3 memory read/write commands and vice versa. This facilitates memory access operations such as writing or reading data to/from memory. The bridge operation is dependant on clock signal and memory control inputs. Depending on control inputs, commands are generated and dispatched when the command queue is not full. The module includes generating correct addresses, data, and select signals for read/write operations and also acknowledging successful transactions. The data width is parameterized and can handle both 32 bit and 128 bit data widths. If the writing command is completed or a read request received when the command queue is full, data is buffered and dispatched when the queue becomes not full. The bridge translates address, data and control signals between the two types to make them compatible."
