    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for holding a request signal (`request_hold`). It accomplishes this task by performing a logical OR operation on two different signals - `request_pulse` and `request_r`. Hereby, the `request_hold` signal gets asserted if either `request_pulse` becomes true or if `request_r` is already true. This operation ensures that the request doesn't get dropped in case it was triggered either by `request_pulse` or by `request_r`."
