    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the output signal 'data_valid_o' based on the particular FPGA family used and the state of the 'data_valid' and 'data_port_fifo_rdy' signals. Specifically, when the FPGA family is 'SPARTAN6', the 'data_valid_o' signal directly mirrors the 'data_valid' signal. For other FPGA families, 'data_valid_o' reflects the readiness state of the data port FIFO."
