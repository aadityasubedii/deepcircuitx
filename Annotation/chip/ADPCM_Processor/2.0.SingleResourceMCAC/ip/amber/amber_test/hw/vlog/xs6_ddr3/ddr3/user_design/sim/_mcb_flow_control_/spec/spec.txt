Module name: mcb_flow_control. 

Module specification: The mcb_flow_control module is designed to control the data and command flow within a Memory Controller Block (MCB). It evaluates different states such as ready, write, read, wait, or refresh stage to determine the next course of action based on parameters like TCQ (time quantum) and FAMILY (type of hardware design family like SPARTAN6). 

This module contains several input and output ports. The inputs include various signals such as system clock (clk_i), reset signal (rst_i), command validity (cmd_valid_i), address (addr_i), block length (bl_i), last word read/write signals, and data pointer readiness signals. The outputs include signals indicating when the module is ready to accept a new command (cmd_rdy_o), output command (cmd_o), output address (addr_o), block length (bl_o), command enable signal (cmd_en_o), and validity status of read and write data pointers. 

Internal signals in the module play a pivotal role in tracking and controlling the state of the logic. They manage different operations such as read, write, command transfer, and state transitions. This module also comprises of registered command, address, and block length signals plus read and write data pointer validation signals. 

The mcb_flow_control module contains several blocks. The initial blocks define the module's parameters, inputs, and outputs. Following blocks declare internal signals used by the module. The module uses an always block to control state transitions based on the input and internal signals' values. Within this block, a case statement is used to determine the next state of the module. Finally, the module ends with assigning output values based on the internal signal state. Through these actions, the mcb_flow_control module provides flow control management for a Memory Controller Block.
