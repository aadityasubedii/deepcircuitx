    "block_comment": "This line of code is responsible for assigning the output of a function, 'mode_name', to a wire, 'xMODE'. Specifically, 'mode_name' takes 'status_bits_mode_r' as its input and the return value of this function is assigned to 'xMODE'. While no detail is provided about the internals of the 'mode_name' function, it is inferred that it performs some sort of transformation or extraction on the 'status_bits_mode_r' variable, perhaps returning useful information about the mode, which 'xMODE' is then set to represent."
