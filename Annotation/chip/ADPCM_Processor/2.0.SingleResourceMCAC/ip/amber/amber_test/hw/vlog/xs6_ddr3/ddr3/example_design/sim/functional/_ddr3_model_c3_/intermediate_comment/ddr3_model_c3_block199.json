    "block_comment": "The provided block of code operates as a Data Strobe (DQS) receiver. It is triggered at every positive edge of the tenth bitwise DQS signal (0-indexed), invoking the `dqs_even_receiver` function with the argument 9. The purpose of this block is to allow synchronous operations based on the arrival of new DQS (typically representing data flow), specifically at the tenth bit position.\n"
