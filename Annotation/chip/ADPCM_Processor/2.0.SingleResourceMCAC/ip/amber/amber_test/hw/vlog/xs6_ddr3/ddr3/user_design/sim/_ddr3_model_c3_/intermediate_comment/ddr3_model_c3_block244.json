    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a delay element for chip select (cs_n) in a digital system. The operation of this block is triggered by any changes on the 'cs_n' signal. This process uses non-blocking assignments to apply a constant delay value (BUS_DELAY) to the 'cs_n' input. The output, 'cs_n_in', will mirror the 'cs_n' signal but with a delay imposed, hence skewing the timing of chip selection."
