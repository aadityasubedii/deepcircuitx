    "block_comment": "This block acts as a clocked receiver for the 9th signal in the `dqs_odd` signal array. When the 9th `dqs_odd` signal transitions from a low to a high voltage level, the procedural block `dqs_odd_receiver(8)`, which is sensitive to this specific event, will execute. This setup is specifically designed for signal synchronization, ensuring that the `dqs_odd_receiver(8)` operates in response to the clock signal's rising edge."
