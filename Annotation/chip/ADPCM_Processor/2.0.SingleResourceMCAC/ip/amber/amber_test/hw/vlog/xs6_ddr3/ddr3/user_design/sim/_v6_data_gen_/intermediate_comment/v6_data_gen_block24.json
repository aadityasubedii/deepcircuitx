    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code acts as a data generator for a specific range of addresses in memory. Upon every positive edge of the clock signal, if the signal `fifo_rdy_i` is true or `cmd_startC` is initiated, the block executes. When `cmd_startC` is triggered and the data mode equals `4'b0101`, the block calls the `Data_Gen` function with the designated 5-bit memory address segment (`addr_i[9:5]`) as argument, and stores the return data into `w1data`. If the data mode differs, `Data_GenW0` function is called instead. The block caters for addresses in range 0 to 29 and 30 to 31, where former uses the immediate address (`0, 1,...`) and the latter wraps around to addresses 0 and 1 respectively. Any other out of range address defaults to zero."
