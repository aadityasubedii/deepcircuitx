This block is responsible for handling command write pendings in response to various input signals. Upon encountering a rising edge clock signal, the block checks for a reset condition first. In case the reset input `rst_i[0]` is active, it sets the `cmd_wr_pending_r1` flag to `0` after a delay of `#TCQ`. If a `last_word_wr_i` signal is received instead, the `cmd_wr_pending_r1` flag is set to `1` after `#TCQ` delay. Otherwise, if a `push_cmd` signal is received, `cmd_wr_pending_r1` is reset to `0` again after a `#TCQ` delay.
