Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code sets up an active change sensitive event on the 14th bit of the input data stream (dq_in). Whenever a change occurs on dq_in[14], the function dq_timing_check(14) is called. The purpose of this function call might be to check any timing related conditions such as skew or setup/hold violations that might occur due to the change in the 14th bit of the input stream.
