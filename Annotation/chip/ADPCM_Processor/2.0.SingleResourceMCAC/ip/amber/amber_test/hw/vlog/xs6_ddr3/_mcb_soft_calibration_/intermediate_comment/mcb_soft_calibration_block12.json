    "block_comment": "The provided block of Verilog code is a state machine transition that handles the UDQS_WAIT2 state. If the signal MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is not ready (i.e., it's equal to zero), the block forces the state machine to remain in the current UDQS_WAIT2 state. Otherwise, it resets DQS_DELAY and TARGET_DQS_DELAY to their initial values and signals the state machine to transition to the START_DYN_CAL state. This block is a part of dynamic calibration for DQS delay."
