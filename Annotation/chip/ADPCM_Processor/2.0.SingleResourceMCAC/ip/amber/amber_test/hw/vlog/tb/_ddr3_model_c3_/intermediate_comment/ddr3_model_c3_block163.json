    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to execute a command address timing check whenever there is a change in bit 1 of the 'addr_in' signal. Here, the 'always @' construct is used in Verilog code to set up a sensitive action; in this case, as soon as there is a change in second bit of input address ('addr_in[1]'), the module 'cmd_addr_timing_check' is activated with the input parameter '8'."
