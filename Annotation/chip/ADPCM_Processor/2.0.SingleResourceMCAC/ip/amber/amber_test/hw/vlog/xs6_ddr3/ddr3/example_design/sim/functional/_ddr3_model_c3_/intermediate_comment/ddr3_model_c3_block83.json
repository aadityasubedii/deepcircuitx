    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is performing a timing check on the 48th bit of the input data line 'dq_in' triggered by every state change. It achieves this task specifically via the 'always @' statement, which is a basic construct in Verilog, sending this bit to the 'dq_timing_check' function each time there is a change in the state of the 'dq_in[47]' bit, ensuring that the timing is checked and maintained for this particular bit."
