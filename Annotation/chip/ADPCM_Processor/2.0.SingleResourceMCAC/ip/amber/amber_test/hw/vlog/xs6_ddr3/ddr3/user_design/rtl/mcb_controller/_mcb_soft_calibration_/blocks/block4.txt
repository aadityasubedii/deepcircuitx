Comment: 
This block manages a counter. It operates on the positive edge of the user interface clock (UI_CLK): if the reset register (RST_reg) is on, the counter is reset to zero; if the counter enable (counter_en) signal is active, the counter increments by one; otherwise, the counter is reset to zero.
