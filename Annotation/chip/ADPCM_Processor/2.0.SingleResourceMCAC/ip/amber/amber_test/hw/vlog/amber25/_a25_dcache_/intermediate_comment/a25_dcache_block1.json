However, use the following as an example guide to create a comment:\n\nExample code:\n```verilog\nmodule multiplier (input [7:0] a, b, output [15:0] y);\n   assign y = a * b;\nendmodule\n```\n\nComment for the code block:\n\"This block functions as an 8-bit multiplier. It uses 'assign' keyword to directly multiply inputs 'a' and 'b' creating a 16-bit product 'y'.\""
