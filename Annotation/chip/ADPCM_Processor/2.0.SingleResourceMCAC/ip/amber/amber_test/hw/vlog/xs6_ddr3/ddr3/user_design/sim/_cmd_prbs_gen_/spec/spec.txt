Module name: cmd_prbs_gen.
  
Module specification: The cmd_prbs_gen module is specifically designed to generate pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) used in various tasks such as address generation or instruction definitions. The pseudorandom sequences are generated with the help of linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs).

The module takes four inputs: 
1. 'clk_i', a clock input that synchronizes operations,
2. 'prbs_seed_init', a binary signal to initialize the PRBS seed,
3. 'clk_en', a clock enable signal to control when the clock is active, and
4. 'prbs_seed_i', a seed input port to initialize PRBS generation to a known state.
The sole output of the module is 'prbs_o', a PRBS output port emitting the sequential binary data processed within the module.

Internally, the module utilizes three key signals: 
1. 'ZEROS', a wire that provides a line of zeroes and is always assigned to 0, 
2. 'prbs', a register holding the PRBS generated by the logic block inside the module, and 
3. 'lfsr_q', a linear feedback shift register that generates pseudorandom sequences.

The code of the module is divided into several major blocks or sections. The first section declares parameters, inputs, outputs, and internal signals. Following this, there are three generate-if blocks used for generating 64-bit, 32-bit, and 20-bit pseudorandom sequences based on the parameter values of 'PRBS_CMD' & 'PRBS_WIDTH'. The logic inside these generate-if blocks utilizes LFSRs and conditional logic to derive these sequences. There is also a logb2 function that calculates the logarithm to base 2 of an input number. The final section of the code assigns the generated PRBS to the output port.
