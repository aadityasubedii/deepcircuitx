Comment: 
The block controls a user burst counter in synchronous logic as per the input conditions and a reset signal. At every positive clock edge, if the reset signal is true, the burst count resets. If the command start signal is true and the FPGA family is 'SPARTAN6', it checks for a condition based on the bl_i input and adjusts the burst count accordingly. If the FPGA family is not 'SPARTAN6', it directly considers the value of the bl_i input to set the burst count. If neither reset nor command start is true and the FIFO isn't full, it decreases the burst count if not already zero or keeps it zero.
