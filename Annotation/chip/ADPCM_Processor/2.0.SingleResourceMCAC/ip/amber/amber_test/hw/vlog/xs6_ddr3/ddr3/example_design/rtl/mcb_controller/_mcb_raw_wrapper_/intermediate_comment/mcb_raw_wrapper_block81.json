    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for managing the self-refresh requests of a specific module within the system. It performs its function by using a state machine which triggers based on different system conditions. When the system reset (`sys_rst`) is high, it forces the `soft_cal_selfrefresh_req` signal to be low. However, if the third register in self-refresh mode (`selfrefresh_enter_r3`) is high, it sets the request signal high, indicating a self-refresh request. If the `selfrefresh_enter_r3` is not high and the phase-locked loop (PLL) is locked (`pll_lock`), the request signal is set low again. Otherwise, it retains its previous state."
