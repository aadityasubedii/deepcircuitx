    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a counter in synchronous digital systems. The counter gets reset to zero (6'd0) on the positive edge of UI_CLK if RST_reg is high. When the counter enable signal (counter_en) is high, the counter increments by one at the positive edge of UI_CLK, otherwise the counter returns to a state of zero."
