Comment: 
This block of code implements a bus delay for the 'dm_tdqs' signal. It's essentially defining that the 'dm_in' signal should asynchronously track the 'dm_tdqs' signal with a delay specified by 'BUS_DELAY'. This is achieved using the always keyword in Verilog, which triggers on any change in the 'dm_tdqs' signal. The '#BUS_DELAY' is the delay time in simulation that it takes for 'dm_in' to reflect the changes of 'dm_tdqs'.
