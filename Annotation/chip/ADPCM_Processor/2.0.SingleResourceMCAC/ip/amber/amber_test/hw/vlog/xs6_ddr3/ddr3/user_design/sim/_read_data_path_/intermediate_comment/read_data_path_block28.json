    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to assign the value of the variable 'force_wrcmd_gen' to the output 'force_wrcmd_gen_o'. In terms of implementation, it uses the 'assign' keyword, which indicates a continuous assignment statement in Verilog. This is a concurrent statement which means it happens concurrently with other operations in the system and does not use execution order. The assignment is completed using an '=' operator."
