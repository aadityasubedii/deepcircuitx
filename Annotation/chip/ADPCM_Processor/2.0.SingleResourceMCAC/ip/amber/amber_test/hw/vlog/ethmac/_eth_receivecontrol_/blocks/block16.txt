This block of code performs the function of a delay cyclic redundancy-check (CRC) counter in a data reception system. The counter resets whenever a reception reset signal (`RxReset`) is observed or at the end of a data frame (`RxEndFrm`). When data is being received (`RxValid`) and it's not the end of the frame and the 3rd bit of the current counter value is not set, the block increments the counter. The exact delay period is defined by `#Tp`. This mechanism ensures accurate frame reception by maintaining and managing a delay CRC count.
