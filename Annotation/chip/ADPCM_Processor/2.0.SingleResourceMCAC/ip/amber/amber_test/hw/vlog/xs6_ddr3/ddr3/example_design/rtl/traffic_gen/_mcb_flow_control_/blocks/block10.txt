This statement is simply assigning the value of 'rdp_valid' to the output signal 'rdp_valid_o'. This is achieved using the Verilog 'assign' keyword, which continuously drives the value of the right-hand side expression (here, 'rdp_valid') to the left-hand side net (here, 'rdp_valid_o'). Essentially, whenever 'rdp_valid' changes, 'rdp_valid_o' will immediately reflect that change.
