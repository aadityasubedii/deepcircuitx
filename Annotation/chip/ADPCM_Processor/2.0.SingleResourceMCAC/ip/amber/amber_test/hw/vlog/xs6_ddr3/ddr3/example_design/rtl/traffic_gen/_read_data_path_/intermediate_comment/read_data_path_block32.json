    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a force write command (`force_wrcmd_gen`). It is triggered at the positive edge of the clock (`clk_i`), and its action depends on several conditions. If the first bit of the reset input `rst_i[0]` is high, it makes the `force_wrcmd_gen` low. If the system is not waiting for block end (`wait_bl_end == 1'b0`) and the previous cycle was in wait state, or if the force write command timeout count reaches its maximum ('11111111'), `force_wrcmd_gen` is also set low. However, if a valid command is received (`cmd_valid_i`) and the block size (`bl_i`) is greater than 16 or the system is still waiting for a block end, then `force_wrcmd_gen` is made high."
