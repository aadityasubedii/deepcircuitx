Comment: 
This block of code launches an edge-triggered procedure 'dqs_odd_receiver' whenever a positive edge (transition from low to high) is detected in 'dqs_odd[3]'. It means that when the signal 'dqs_odd[3]' changes from 0 to 1, the function 'dqs_odd_receiver' with the parameter '3' is started. This is a typical style used in hardware description languages for describing logic that responds to changes in signals.
