This block of code comprises a data-write mechanism for a synchronous memory unit in Verilog. It utilizes the rising edge (`posedge`) of the input clock signal (`i_clk`) to control the timing of its operations. Firstly, it sets write-enable (`wr_en`), write-mask (`wr_mask`), and write-data (`wr_data`) based on the input write start signal (`start_write`), the inverse of selected word signal (`i_wb_sel`), and data signal (`i_wb_dat`) respectively. Then it determines the value of `addr_d1` controlled by `i_mem_ctrl`. If write is enabled, it updates the memory location `addr_d1[27:2]` with the bitwise-and of `wr_mask` and `wr_data`.
