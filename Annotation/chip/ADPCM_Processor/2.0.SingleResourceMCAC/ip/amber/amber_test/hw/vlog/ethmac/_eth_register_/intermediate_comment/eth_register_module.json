    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe 'eth_register' module acts as a customized register storing variable-width data with both synchronous and asynchronous reset capabilities. Data is fed through the 'DataIn' port and, upon a high 'Write' signal, is stored in an internal register 'DataOut'. This data can be reset to 'RESET_VALUE' either asynchronously upon a high 'Reset' signal or synchronously on the next clock cycle with a high 'SyncReset' signal. The 'DataOut' port outputs the stored or reset data. Data width is parameterized by 'WIDTH'."
