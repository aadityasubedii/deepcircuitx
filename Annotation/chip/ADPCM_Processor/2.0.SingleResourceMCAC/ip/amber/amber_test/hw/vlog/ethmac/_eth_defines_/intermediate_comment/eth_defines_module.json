    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog code serves as a parameter setting file for an Ethernet-related module, setting various constants and parameters that will be used in other modules. It consists of preprocessor directives, defining addresses, default values, widths, FIFO depths, burst length, and base addresses. Please note, this code does not implement any specific functionalities and does not have any input or output ports. It is designed to be included in a larger hardware system potentially housing Ethernet-related modules. The parameters and constants defined here may be used across such modules."
