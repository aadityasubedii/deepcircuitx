The function of this block is to perform data timing checks on data mask bits in digital memory applications. The block implementation performs bit-level timing checks based on various parameters such as data hold time (`TDH`) and input pulse width (`TDIPW`). The timing checks are performed only when the `dqs_in_valid` signal is active. If timing violations are detected, appropriate error messages are displayed with details on the bit index (`i`) and time of violation. After the checks, the `check_dm_tdipw[i]` flag is reset to '0', and the current time is stored in `tm_dm[i]` for the next check sequence.
