    "block_comment": "This block of code triggers a DQS positive edge timing check function on the positive edge of the input signal. The \"always @ (posedge dqs_in[ 9])\" construct ensures that the function 'dqs_pos_timing_check' is executed whenever a positive edge (or rising edge) is detected on the 10th bit of the 'dqs_in' signal array."
