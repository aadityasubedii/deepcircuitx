Comment: 
The given Verilog RTL task, `shift_n_expand`, operates on an 8-bit input (data_in) and generates a 9-bit output (data_out), with specific transformations implemented on the input bits. The implementation consists of a series of conditional statements that check the value of every two bits of the input data. If the two bits are equal to `2'b10`, the relevant bits in the output are set to `2'b11`. Otherwise, the output bits are set as the bitwise concatenation of the current input bit and the previous output bit. As a result, the task effectively expands and alters the input data based on the defined bit-wise conditions.
