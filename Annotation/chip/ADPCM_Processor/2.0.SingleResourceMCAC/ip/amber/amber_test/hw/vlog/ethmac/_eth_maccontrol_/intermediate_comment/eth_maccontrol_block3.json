    "block_comment": "This line of code is responsible for the assignment of the output enable signal for the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). The state of 'CrcEnOut' is determined by the logical OR operation between the input enable signal 'CrcEnIn' and 'SendingCtrlFrm'. This suggests that the CRC would be enabled when either a control frame is being sent or when it's explicitly enabled by the 'CrcEnIn' signal."
