Comment: 
The given block comprises two sub-blocks: `WRITE_CALIBRATE` and `WAIT9`. The `WRITE_CALIBRATE` block initializes several registers in preparation for a calibration write. The `IODRPCTRLR_CMD_VALID` is set to initiate the command process. The calibration addresses and data write values are dictated by `DelayControl` and `8'h20` respectively. The `Active_IODRP` is assigned the value of `RZQ` in calibration write operation. Depending on if `IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N` is ready or busy, it can stay in `WRITE_CALIBRATE` state, or transition to `WAIT9` state. Next, the `WAIT9` block is responsible for implementing a waiting mechanism that counts till a predetermined value (38 in this case) is exceeded before transitioning to `READ_MAX_VALUE` state, enabling a counter to track the waiting time.
