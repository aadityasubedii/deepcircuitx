    "block_comment": "This Verilog block runs a timing check for the 38th element (index 37) of the multi-bit data queue (dq_in). It does so by specifying dq_in[37] in the sensitivity list of an \"always\" block, meaning the procedure 'dq_timing_check' will be activated any time there is a change in the state of dq_in[37]. This method ensures accurate timing analysis for specific, critical elements within the data path."
