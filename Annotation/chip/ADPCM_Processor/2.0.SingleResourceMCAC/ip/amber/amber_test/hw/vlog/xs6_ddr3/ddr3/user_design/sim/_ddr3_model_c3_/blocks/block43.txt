Comment: 
This block of code is designed to perform timing checks on a data strobe signal. Using a negative-edge triggered sensitivity list, the block initiates the `dqs_pos_timing_check(22)` function whenever there's a falling edge (negative transition) detected on the 23rd signal (`dqs_in[22]`) of the `dqs_in` bus. The behavior of the function `dqs_pos_timing_check(22)` which is referenced but not defined within this block, will define the exact timing checks performed.
