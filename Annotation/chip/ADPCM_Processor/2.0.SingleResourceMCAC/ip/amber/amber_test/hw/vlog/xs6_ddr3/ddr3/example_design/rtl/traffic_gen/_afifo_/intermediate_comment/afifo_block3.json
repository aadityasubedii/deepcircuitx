    "block_comment": "This line of code calculates the availability of buffer space in the FIFO queue. Specifically, it adds the FIFO_DEPTH (the maximum size of the FIFO) to the `rd_capture_ptr` (read pointer), and then subtracts the `wr_ptr` (write pointer). This operation provides the distance between the write and read pointers, which represents the currently available space in the FIFO buffer."
