Comment: 
This block of code handles the state of receiver buffer descriptor readiness (`RxBDReady`) in response to different incoming signals. It works on either the positive edge of WB_CLK_I or Reset. The `RxBDReady` is reset (set to 0) if a reset is triggered or if a read operation is performed on the receiver pointer (`RxPointerRead`). Alternatively, if an enable condition (`RxEn & RxEn_q & RxBDRead`) is met, `RxBDReady` is updated with the 16th bit of the `ram_do` data output.
