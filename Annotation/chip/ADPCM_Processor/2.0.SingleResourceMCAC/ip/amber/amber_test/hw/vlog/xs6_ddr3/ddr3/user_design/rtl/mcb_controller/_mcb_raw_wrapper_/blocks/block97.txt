The function `cdiv` computes the ceiling division of two integers. It accomplishes this by performing standard division (`num/div`), and then checks if there is a remainder using the modulus operator (`num%div`). If the remainder is greater than zero, it adds one to the division result, otherwise it adds zero, effectively rounding up the division result if there's any remainder.
