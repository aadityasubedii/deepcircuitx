    "block_comment": "This block of code surveys for improper command inputs in read-only port 2. It triggers a conditionally check based on specific bits of the C_PORT_CONFIG and p2_cmd_instr values along with the p2_cmd_en flag. If these conditions are met, encompassing the scenario when C_PORT_CONFIG[119:96] equals \"R32\", p2_cmd_en is high, and both third and first bits of p2_cmd_instr are low (indicating an invalid command signal for read-only port 2), an error message is displayed and the simulation is terminated."
