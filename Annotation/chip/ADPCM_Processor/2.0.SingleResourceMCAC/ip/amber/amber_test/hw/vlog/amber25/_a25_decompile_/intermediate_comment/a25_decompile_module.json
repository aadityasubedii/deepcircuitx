    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements an ARM instruction decompiler for debugging and analysis. It decodes incoming instructions, extracts relevant fields, and generates human-readable assembly language output. The module tracks execution, handles interrupts, and formats detailed instruction information, writing it to a file. It uses combinational logic for instruction decoding and sequential logic for execution tracking and output generation, providing a comprehensive view of the ARM processor's operation during simulation."
