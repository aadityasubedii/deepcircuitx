Comment: 
This block of code disables operations in a given condition. Specifically, it deactivates the counter ('counter_en' is set to 0), invalidates the memory cell command ('IODRPCTRLR_CMD_VALID' is set to 0), sets the address of the memory cell to a default 'NoOp' state ('IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR' is assigned 'NoOp'), sets the memory operation to read mode ('IODRPCTRLR_R_WB' is set to 'READ_MODE') and finally, it switches off the use of backup store (BKST) ('IODRPCTRLR_USE_BKST' is set to 0).
