    "block_comment": "This block manages read operations within a clock cycle. At every positive edge of the input clock, the status of `start_read` is latched to the registries `start_read_d1` and `start_read_d2` in two consecutive clock cycles, creating a two-stage delay pipeline. If `start_read_d1` is set, which happens one cycle after `start_read` is set, then the block propagates the `rd_data` into `wb_rdata128`."
