Module name: clocks_resets. 

Module specification: The clocks_resets module manages the system clocks and reset signals. It takes four input ports: i_brd_rst (the system-wide reset signal), i_brd_clk_n and i_brd_clk_p (differential main clock signals), i_ddr_calib_done (a signal that indicates the completion of DDR calibration). It produces three output ports: o_sys_rst (reset signal it generates), o_sys_clk (system clock signal it generates), o_clk_200 (a 200 MHz clock signal it generates).

Internally, it uses various signals including calib_done_33mhz and rst0 (used in generating reset signal), pll_locked (indicates locking of clock multiplication unit), clkfbout_clkfbin (used in loop feedback of PLL or MMCM) and others including rst0_sync_r, ddr_calib_done_sync_r, rst_tmp, pll_clk, brd_clk_ibufg, brd_clk_period, pll_clk_period, brd_temp, pll_clk_beh, sys_clk_beh, pll_div_count. These are used for synchronization, clock generation, buffering, temporal storage, timing, behavioral simulation, and calculating clock periods.

The code can be divided into three main blocks based on functionality. The first block deals with conditional compilation based on the targeted FPGA platform and generates the system clock signal. It employs either a PLL_ADV or MMCM_ADV for clock generation based on whether XILINX_FPGA and the specific type is defined. The second block generates reset signals synchronized with the system clock and outputs the clock and reset signals. In the absence of a Xilinx FPGA, the module contains a behavioral simulation block that generates the clock signals and reset signal. Under such settings, it also gives parameters for time period calculation for behavioral simulation of the clock. This module provides an essential service by producing the required clock and reset signals for other system components, effectively acting as the heartbeat of the digital system.
