    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a task primarily for timing violation detection in a DDR protocol environment. It checks various timing parameters during write-levelization and while the Data Strobe (dqs) is in a valid state. It includes checks for tWLDQSEN, tDQSH, tDSH and tDS violations through multiple conditional statements. If a timing violation is detected, an error message is output with details including the time, and the specific bit where the issue occurred. Within these checks, other conditionals help manage transitions and the dynamic nature of the system, such as conditions when DLL is locked or output enable signal is not active. The last few lines are used to update the status of the timing checks, the Data Strobe time and the previous 'dqs_in' state before the next task call."
