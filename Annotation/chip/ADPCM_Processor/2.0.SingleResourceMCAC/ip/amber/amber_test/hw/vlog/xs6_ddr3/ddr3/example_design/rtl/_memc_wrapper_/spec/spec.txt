Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: The memc_wrapper module is a high-level interface wrapper for a memory controller (MCB) designed to interact with external DDR3 SDRAM. It provides multiple ports (p0 to p5) for command, write, and read operations, as well as AXI interfaces (s0 to s5) for advanced system integration. The module handles memory addressing, data transfer, and various timing parameters required for proper memory operation. Input ports include clock signals (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90), reset (async_rst), and multiple command/data inputs for each port. Output ports consist of memory interface signals (mcbx_dram_*), status indicators (calib_done, selfrefresh_mode), and data/status outputs for each port. Internal signals include
