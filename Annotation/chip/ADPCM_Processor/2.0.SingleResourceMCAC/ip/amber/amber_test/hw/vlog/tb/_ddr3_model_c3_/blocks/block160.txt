Comment: 
This block triggers a function call to `cmd_addr_timing_check` whenever a change is observed in the 5th bit of `addr_in`. The function call is made with the static argument '11'. The block uses an `always` block triggered by the specified bit in the binary number. This allows the block to perform a timing check operation based on the specified address position whenever the 5th bit changes.
