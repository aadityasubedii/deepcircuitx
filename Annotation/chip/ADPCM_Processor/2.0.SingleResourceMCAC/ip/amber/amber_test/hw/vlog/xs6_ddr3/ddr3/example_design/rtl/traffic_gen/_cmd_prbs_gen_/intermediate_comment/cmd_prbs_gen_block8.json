    "block_comment": "This block of code is a base-2 logarithm function. It primarily calculates the log base 2 of a 32-bit integer input. The calculation is done by right shifting the input until it becomes zero and incrementing a counter on each shift. The count value at the end of the iterations is the output, representing the base-2 logarithm of the input value."
