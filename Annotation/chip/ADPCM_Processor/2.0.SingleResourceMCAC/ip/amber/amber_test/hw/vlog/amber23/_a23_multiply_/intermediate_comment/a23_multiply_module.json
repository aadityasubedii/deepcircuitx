    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe 'a23_multiply' module performs 32-bit multiplication operations, either standard or accumulative, based on two input operands. It is clock-synchronized and can be stalled. This functionality is achieved by a sequence controlled by a state machine involving Booth's algorithm for partial product calculation, FPGA specific arithmetic operation units, and a combination of internal signals for state transition and output generation. The arithmetic operations are conditionally executed based on input control signals and status. The result of the operation and its status indicators are made available at the output.\n"
