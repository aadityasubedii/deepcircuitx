    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the operation of a reset register (`RST_reg`). It is triggered by the positive edge of the user interface clock (`UI_CLK`) or a non-violating reset signal. If the non-violating reset is active, it sets the `RST_reg` high. On the other hand, if the 16th bit of the `WAIT_200us_COUNTER` is zero, it also sets the `RST_reg` high. Otherwise, `RST_reg` is set with the value of a temporary reset signal (`rst_tmp`)."
