The block is responsible for implementing a 200 microseconds waiting timer or counter, which can be reset by an internal system reset signal. Upon each rising edge of the UI clock, or when an internal system reset takes place, the counter is reset to zero. However, in the absence of a reset signal, and provided the highest bit of the counter is not set, the counter value is incremented by 1, imposing a limit on the counter's permissible range.
