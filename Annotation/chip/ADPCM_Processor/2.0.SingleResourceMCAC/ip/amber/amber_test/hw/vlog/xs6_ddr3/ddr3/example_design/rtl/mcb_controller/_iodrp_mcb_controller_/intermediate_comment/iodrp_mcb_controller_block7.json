    "block_comment": "This block implements a synchronous reset mechanism for a DRP_CLK-driven 'read_data' register and handles an particular state condition. When a reset event 'sync_rst' occurs in the clock cycle (rising edge of DRP_CLK), the 'read_data' register is set to '0'. In the absence of the reset, it checks whether the state is 'ALMOST_READY3'. If it is, the 'read_data' register takes the value of 'shift_through_reg'."
