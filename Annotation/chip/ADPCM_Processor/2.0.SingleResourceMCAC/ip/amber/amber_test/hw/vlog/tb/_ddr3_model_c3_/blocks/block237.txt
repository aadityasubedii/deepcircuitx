Comment: 
This block of code describes a delay line, specifically for the signal 'dq'. The 'dq' signal is sampled at each positive edge of the system clock and held momentarily for a specific duration defined by the parameter 'BUS_DELAY'. This delay mechanism is implemented using non-blocking assignments, which ensure the delayed signal update occurs after all other concurrent events in the current time step have been evaluated, thereby accurately simulating the hardware behavior.
