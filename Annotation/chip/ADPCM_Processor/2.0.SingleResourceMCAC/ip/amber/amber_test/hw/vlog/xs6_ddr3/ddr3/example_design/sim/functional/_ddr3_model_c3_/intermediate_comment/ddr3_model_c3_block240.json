    "block_comment": "This block performs a write enable delay function in a memory circuit. It uses a non-blocking assignment to delay the 'we_n' signal by a predetermined amount specified by 'BUS_DELAY'. The delayed signal is then assigned to 'we_n_in'. This ensures that the write enable command is properly synchronized, thus helping to prevent race conditions or other timing-related issues."
