Comment: 
This Verilog block generates a section of code depending upon the value of the parameter SYNC. The functionality is controlled by the conditional 'if' statement, which checks whether SYNC is equal to 1. If SYNC equals 1, the section under the label RDSYNC begins. The code within this block can have different functionality based on design such as synchronization of signals or similar tasks. Implementation details are specific to what comes within this block after it begins (not shown).
