    "block_comment": "The block of code handles data manipulation based on certain conditions. Upon receiving the positive edge of the input clock (clk_i), if fifo_rdy_i is true, or the command cmd_startC is initialized, the system checks for the select generator flag (sel_w1gen_logic). If true, it then determines the output w1data based on the value of addr_i[8:5] with a case structure. It produces the data either from the Data_Gen() function or the Data_GenW0() function according to the data_mode_i, where '4b0101 indicates the former. On the other hand, if the input MEM_BURST_LEN equals 8, the system shifts the values in w1data by manipulating the bits in the defined length, filled by the last 4 bits of the subsequent higher segment of the w1data."
