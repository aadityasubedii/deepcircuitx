This block of code handles receiving data strobes in DDR communication. In response to the rising edge (positive edge) of the 'dqs_even[1]' signal, the procedure 'dqs_even_receiver(1)' is called. The block utilizes an always block to trigger this procedure, effectively achieving a reactiveness to the changes of the 'dqs_even[1]' signal; thus ensuring the correct handling and synchronization of the data strobes in the DDR communication scheme.
