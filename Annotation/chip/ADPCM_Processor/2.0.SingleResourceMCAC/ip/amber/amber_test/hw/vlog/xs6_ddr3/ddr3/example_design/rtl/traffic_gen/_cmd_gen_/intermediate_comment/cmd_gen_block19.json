    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to manage memory initialisation in a synchronous digital system. It assigns a start address to `addr_counts` during a reset or when the current address reaches an end address, and it monitors the initialisation process of the memory. If `rst_i[4]` (a specific bit of the reset signal) is high at the positive edge of the clock cycle, the system is in its reset phase, and `mem_init_done` is set to zero, indicating that memory initialisation is not complete. If a command clock enable or load pulse mode is triggered or if the next count address exceeds the end address, the start address is reassigned to `addr_counts`, and `mem_init_done` is set to one, signifying completion of memory initialisation. The process also includes an increment operation which steps up the count address if it's less than the end address."
