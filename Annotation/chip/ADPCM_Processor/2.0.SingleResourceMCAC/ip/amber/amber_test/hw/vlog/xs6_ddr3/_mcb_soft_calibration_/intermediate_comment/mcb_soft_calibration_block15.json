    "block_comment": "The code block primarily serves to manage memory operations on an FPGA (Function of block). It operates in two states, LDQS_WAIT2 and UDQS_WRITE_POS_INDELAY. In the former, if the Memory Control Block (MCB) is not ready or busy, it stays in this state. When the MCB is ready, it transitions to the UDQS_WRITE_POS_INDELAY state. In this state, it sets various parameters like memory cell address, read/write mode, and write data. The UIADDR is set to the UDQS clock, and the command validity flag is also set (Implementation details of the block)."
