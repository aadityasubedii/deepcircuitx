    "module": "Module-level comment: The a23_register_bank module serves as a multi-mode register system for an A23 microprocessor. It includes structures for loading user mode registers, handling mode switches (USR, SVC, IRQ, FIQR), and executing exception handling. The module uses input control signals for read/write operations, register selections, and changing modes, while its output signals provide the state of respective registers and the program counter. The functionality is realized through a series of internal registers along with a series of conditional checks and assignments that execute on the positive edge of the system clock. This module significantly encapsulates the logic required for a run-time register bank in an A23 microprocessor."
