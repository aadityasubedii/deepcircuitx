    "module": "Module-level comment: The xs6_sram_256x21_line_en module implements a 256x21 SRAM using Xilinx's RAMB8BWER in a Simple Dual Port (SDP) mode. It provides synchronized read and write operations controlled by 'i_clk', 'i_write_data', 'i_write_enable' and 'i_address' inputs. The extracted data is made available on 'o_read_data' output. Internally, 'read_data_lo' and 'read_data_hi' signals fetch lower and higher bits of data respectively. Initialization checks for data and address width ensure correct parameter settings."
