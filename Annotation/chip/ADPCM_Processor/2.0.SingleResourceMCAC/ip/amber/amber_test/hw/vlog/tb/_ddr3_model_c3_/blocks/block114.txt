This block of code is used to monitor the 16th bit of the dq_in input array and call the dq_timing_check function anytime there is a change in the 16th bit. The keyword 'always' is used to create an infinite loop, and the '@' operator is used for sensitivity list which declares on what condition the block will be executed. Thus, this block executes and performs a timing check on the 16th bit of the dq_in input whenever there's a change in its state.
