Comment: 
The block of code represents a task that erases certain memory banks. Leveraging Verilog's `task` feature, this block of code erases memory banks based on the input bit-width bank identifier. If defined (`ifdef`) with a MAX_MEM, the task traverses each bank checking for active banks (bit 1) and then subsequently closes and opens the file using system tasks `$fclose` and `open_bank_file`. For the else condition, the task iterates through every memory location, updates the address and memory based on whether the bank is active or not, and adjusts the total use of memory (`memory_used`), ensuring an orderly clean-up and preservation of inactive bank data.
