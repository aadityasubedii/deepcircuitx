    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is used to assign the ready-busy signal based on the current state of the system. The signal `rdy_busy_n`, indicating system state, is true or high (1) if the system is in ready state and false or low (0) if it is in any other state. This functionality is implemented using the `assign` keyword and an equality comparison between the `state` variable and the `READY` constant."
