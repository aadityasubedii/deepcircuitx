    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs a timing check on the 6th bit of the data quantum synchronization (dqs) signal. The operation triggered during the negative edge of that specific bit, to ensure synchronization and timing of data signals during transmission, thus mitigating the risks of data corruption. This function is implemented using an always block, therefore every time there's a transition from high to low ('negedge') for dqs_in[5], the function `dqs_neg_timing_check(5)` method is called."
