    "block_comment": "This code block is for ensuring timing compliance. Specifically, it checks the timing related to the negative edge of the 16th DQS signal line. The implementation for this operation relies on an `always` block that triggers specifically at the `negedge` (negative edge - when value transitions from high to low) of the `dqs_in[15]` signal, which subsequently invokes the `dqs_neg_timing_check` procedure with parameter 15. This block serves as a routine timing check in the design, ensuring that system operations obey necessary timing constraints."
