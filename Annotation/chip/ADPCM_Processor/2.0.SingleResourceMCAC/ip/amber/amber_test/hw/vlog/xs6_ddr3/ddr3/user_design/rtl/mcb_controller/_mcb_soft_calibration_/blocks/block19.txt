Comment: 
This block is a reset and counter logic module for a user clock driven system. When this system reset (`RST`) is active or user clock (`UI_CLK`) has a rising edge, the `Block_Reset` is initially set low and a `RstCounter` is initialised to zero. If the pre-system reset (`Pre_SYSRST`) condition is high, the `RstCounter` is set to `RST_CNT`. However, if the counter is less than the maximum count (`TZQINIT_MAXCNT`), `Block_Reset` is set high and the counter is incremented by one.
