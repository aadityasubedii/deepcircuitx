    "block_comment": "This block generates read data (wb_rdata32) from different registers based on the address (i_wb_adr) given. When a read request (wb_start_read) is triggered at the edge of the clock (i_clk), it reads different timer load, control, and value registers depending upon the address. Load and value registers data are used directly as it is with zero padding, whereas control registers data is further manipulated to organize in a certain bit pattern before being used. If an address does not match any case, a default value (32'h66778899) is assigned to the read data."
