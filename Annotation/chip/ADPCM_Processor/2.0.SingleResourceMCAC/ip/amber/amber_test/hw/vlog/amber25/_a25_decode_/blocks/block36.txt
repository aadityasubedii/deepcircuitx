Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for managing conflict resolution for a processor pipeline. In the event of a system reset, the block will set all its internal registers representing instruction execution conflicts and register read uses to zero. Otherwise, if the system is not experiencing a core stall, the block monitors instruction execution â€“ carrying out conflict checks using logical AND operations between 'instruction_execute' and the rising edge values of conflct, rn_conflict1, rm_conflict1, rs_conflict1, rd_conflict1. Finally, the block uses a combination of these conflicts and 'instruction_valid' to determine if a register needs to be read, updating the associated register read uses accordingly.
