Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for generating the 'TxAbortOut' signal. It performs this through a mix of logic operations and conditional mux operation based on the 'CtrlMux' signal. When the 'CtrlMux' signal is high, it uses the 'MuxedAbort' signal with negated 'TxStartFrmIn' and 'BlockTxDone' signals for generating 'TxAbortOut'. Otherwise, it uses the 'TxAbortIn' signal with the same negation operations. The produced 'TxAbortOut' indicates whether or not the transmission should be abruptly halted, depending on the input signals.
