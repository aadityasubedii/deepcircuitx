    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a synchronous process, specifically a finite state machine, used for handling the status of a Multicast transmission. It is triggered on the rising edge of a clock signal (MRxClk) or a reset signal (Reset). If a reset signal is detected, the block sets the value of MulticastOK to false, indicating an unsuccessful multicast. Similarly, if there is End of Frame (RxEndFrm) or an Abort Request (RxAbort), MulticastOK is set to false again. However, if the transmission is good (i.e., CrcHashGood is true) and the transmission is a multicast, MulticastOK is set to the HashBit value, effectively indicating a successful multicast state."
