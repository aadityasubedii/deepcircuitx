Comment: 
This block of code manages writes to UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) control and transmit data (TXD) registers in a test bench environment. Upon each rising edge of the clock (`i_clk`), the code checks if a write is being started (`wb_start_write`) and the write address (`i_wb_adr[15:0]`) matches the register's address. If the address matches the UART's control register (`AMBER_TEST_UART_CONTROL`), it updates the control register (`tb_uart_control_reg`) with the lower two bits of the write data (`wb_wdata32[1:0]`). Similarly, if the address matches the UART's transmit data register (`AMBER_TEST_UART_TXD`), it updates the transmit register (`tb_uart_txd_reg`) with the lower eight bits of the write data (`wb_wdata32[7:0]`) and toggles the `tb_uart_push` flag.
