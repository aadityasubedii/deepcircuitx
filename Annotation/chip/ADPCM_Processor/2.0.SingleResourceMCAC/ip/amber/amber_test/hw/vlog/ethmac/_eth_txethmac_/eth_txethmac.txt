Module-level comment: "The 'eth_txethmac' module is a Transmission MAC layer for Ethernet communications. It manages transmission control signals, data, timing specifications, and error detection using internal signals and sub-modules. Inputs include control signals, data, timing specs, and output signals represent the transmission status. Internally, it tracks transmission status, holds data, checks retries, and manages collisions. It interfaces with 'eth_txcounters', 'eth_txstatem', 'eth_crc', 'eth_random' sub-modules for handling different aspects of the transmission process including state management, CRC computation, count data handling, and back-off periods management."
