The function of this block is to control the latch that indicates the validity of transmitted bytes under certain conditions. It achieves this through a process which is triggered on the rising edge of the WB_CLK_I signal or the Reset signal. If Reset is high, the block clears 'LatchValidBytes'. When 'TxLengthLt4' and 'TxBDReady' are both true, 'LatchValidBytes' will be set to 1. In all other cases, 'LatchValidBytes' is cleared indicating no valid bytes.
