    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for signal assignment in Verilog. It assigns the value of the signal `prbs` into `prbs_o`. The assignment is made continually thus any change in the `prbs` signal will have immediate impact on `prbs_o`. It is often used for connecting different parts of the logic together or manipulating signals within the hardware design."
