It's primary functionality lies in temporarily storing memory read data, read data validity, and load register values, allowing these values to be accessed externally in a controlled and synchronized manner. The module is controlled by the following input ports: clk, reset, scan_enable, test_mode, i_mem_stall, i_mem_read_data, i_mem_read_data_valid, i_mem_load_rd, i_daddress, and i_daddress_valid. 'clk' is the clock signal used for synchronization, 'reset' initializes the register values, 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' are used for testing purposes, 'i_mem_stall' stalls the system, 'i_mem_read_data' is the memory data input, 'i_mem_read_data_valid' validates the read data, 'i_mem_load_rd' specifies the load register and 'i_daddress' and 'i_daddress_valid' are used for receiving the data address. The module outputs data through the following ports: o_wb_read_data, o_wb_read_data_valid, and o_wb_load_rd, each corresponding to memory read data, read data validity, and load register. Internally, it employs four registers mem_read_data_r, mem_read_data_valid_r, mem_load_rd_r, and daddress_r to hold and process input information. The code structure comprises of conditional always blocks which manages the module's functionality according to input signals.",

This is done only when the memory stall signal is not active. The module also captures data address independent of other outputs, but still only if memory stall signal is not active. Thus, it essentially serves the purpose of providing read data and related control signals, and the data address from the memory to external interfaces in a synchronized manner following the control signals."

If stall is inactive, fetched data and load register information (i_mem_read_data, i_mem_read_data_valid, and i_mem_load_rd) are written into internal registers (mem_read_data_r, mem_read_data_valid_r, and mem_load_rd_r) and passed to the outside world through their corresponding output ports (o_wb_read_data, o_wb_read_data_valid, and o_wb_load_rd).

Its value changes with each rising edge of the clock if the memory stall signal is disabled. It acts as a temporary storage buffer.\n\n2. mem_read_data_valid_r: This is a single-bit register that holds the value of the read data validity flag. Similarly to mem_read_data_r, its value is updated with the rising edge of the clock if the memory stall signal is not active. This flag is used to ensure the read data is valid.\n\n3. mem_load_rd_r: This 11-bit register holds the load register information. The module updates its value in sync with the clock signal if the memory stall signal is not active. This information is then emitted via the o_wb_load_rd port.\n\n4. daddress_r: This is a 32-bit register to keep the data address.
