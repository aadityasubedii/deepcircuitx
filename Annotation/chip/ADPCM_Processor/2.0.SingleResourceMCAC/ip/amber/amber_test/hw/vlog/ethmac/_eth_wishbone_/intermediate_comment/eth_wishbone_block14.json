    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to detect and assign an error condition for the transmitter (TxError). It accomplishes this by performing a bitwise OR operation on four conditions: TxUnderRun, RetryLimit, LateCollLatched, and CarrierSenseLost. If any of these conditions are true, the result will be an error state (TxError), indicating that there is some problem with the transmission."
