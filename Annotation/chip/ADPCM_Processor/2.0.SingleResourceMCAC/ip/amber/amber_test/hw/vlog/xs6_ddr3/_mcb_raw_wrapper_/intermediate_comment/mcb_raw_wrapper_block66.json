    "block_comment": "This block handles the assignment of bus control signals and data transfers for a memory interface (MIG) in a conditional manner. If the fourth port is enabled, the signals for command and data transfers are directed to the interface from the third port. This includes setting the arbitrator enable, command clock, enable signal, row, bank, and column addresses, burst length for commands, clock, and enable signal for read and write operations, the write data and mask. It also assigns the read and write counts returned from the MIG to the third port. In the case that the fourth port isn't enabled, all these assignments default to zero, effectively disabling the transfers."
