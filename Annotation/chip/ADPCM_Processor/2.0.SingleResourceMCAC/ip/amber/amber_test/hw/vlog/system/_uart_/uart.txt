Module-level comment: This UART module implements a configurable transmitter and receiver with FIFO buffers. It supports Wishbone bus interface for register access and data transfer. The module uses separate state machines for transmit and receive operations, handles flow control (CTS/RTS), and generates interrupts. It includes configurable parameters like baud rate, data width, and stop bits, and supports both FIFO and non-FIFO modes for flexible operation in various applications.
