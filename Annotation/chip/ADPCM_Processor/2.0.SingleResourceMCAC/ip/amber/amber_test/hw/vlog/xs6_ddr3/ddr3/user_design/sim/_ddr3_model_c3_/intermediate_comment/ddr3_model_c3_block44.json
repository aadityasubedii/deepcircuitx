    "block_comment": "This block initiates a negative edge-triggered timing check for the 22nd bit of the `dqs_in` signal. The function `dqs_pos_timing_check` is called whenever there is a negative transition at the 22nd bit of `dqs_in`, i.e., when it goes from logic high '1' to logic low '0'. This is a way to ensure proper synchronization and timing compliance in memory modules where `dqs_in` signal is associated."
