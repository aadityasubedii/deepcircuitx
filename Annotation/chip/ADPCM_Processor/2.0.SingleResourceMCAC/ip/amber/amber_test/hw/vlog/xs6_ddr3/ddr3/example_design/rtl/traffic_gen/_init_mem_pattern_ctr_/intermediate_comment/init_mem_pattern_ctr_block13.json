    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code detects whether a specified end address has been reached, based on a few conditions related to the type of FPGA family and the data width being used. The end address is considered reached (\"end_addr_reached\" is set to 1) if each of these conditions is true: both the upper and lower ends have been matched (\"upper_end_matched\" and \"lower_end_matched\"), the FPGA family is either SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6 (\"FAMILY\"), and the data width (\"DWIDTH\") is 32 or 64 (for SPARTAN6) or 128 (strictly for SPARTAN6), but doesn't matter for VIRTEX6. If these conditions are not met, \"end_addr_reached\" is set to 0."
