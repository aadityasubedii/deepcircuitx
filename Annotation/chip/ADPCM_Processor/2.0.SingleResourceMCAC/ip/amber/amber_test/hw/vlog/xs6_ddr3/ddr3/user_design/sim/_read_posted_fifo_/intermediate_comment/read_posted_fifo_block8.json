    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for handling a status signal change regarding user buffer level count based on the validity of incoming data. Specifically, the block updates the signal 'user_bl_cnt_not_1' every positive edge of the input clock 'clk_i'. It sets 'user_bl_cnt_not_1' to TRUE if there is valid data ('data_valid_i') and the user buffer level count is one ('user_bl_cnt_is_1'). Otherwise, 'user_bl_cnt_not_1' is set to FALSE. This block of the circuit operates asynchronously based on clock events."
