    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a task function in Verilog, serving as a DQS Odd Receiver. The primary function is manipulating the Data Mask (`dm_in and dm_in_neg`) and input data (`dq_in`) based on the DQS and DQ_PER_DQS signals. The `bit_mask` is likely used for selective bit manipulation within a 64-bit data interface, influenced by 'DQ_PER_DQS' shift operations denoted via the`<<` operator. Upon `dqs_odd[i]` assertion, the block determines whether to disable mask input (`dm_in_neg`) depending on the `tdqs_en` flag, and also modifies data input `dq_in_neg` using bitwise operations on `dq_in` and `bit_mask`."
