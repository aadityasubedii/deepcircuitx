    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) for Pseudo Random Bit Sequence (PRBS) generation. The operation of the LFSR is controlled by the clock signal `clk_i` and the enable signal `clk_en`. During each rising edge of the clock, if `prbs_seed_init` is true, the LFSR is initialized by loading the input seed `prbs_seed_i` into `lfsr_q`. Otherwise, if `clk_en` is true, the LFSR performs a shift operation, with the new value of each cell being the XOR of two specified cells in the previous state. This shift and feedback operation generates the desired PRBS."
