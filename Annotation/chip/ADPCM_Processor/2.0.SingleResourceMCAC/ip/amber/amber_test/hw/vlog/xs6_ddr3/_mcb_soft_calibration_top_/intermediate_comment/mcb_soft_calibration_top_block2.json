    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for synchronous resetting of the system. When a reset (RST) or user interface clock(UI_CLK) triggers a positive edge, it resets two pairs of registers. The registers ZIO_IN_R1, ZIO_IN_R2, RZQ_IN_R1, and RZQ_IN_R2 are set to binary zero, thus achieving a system reset. This enables a clean starting or re-starting state for the system, clearing any previous values stored in these registers."
