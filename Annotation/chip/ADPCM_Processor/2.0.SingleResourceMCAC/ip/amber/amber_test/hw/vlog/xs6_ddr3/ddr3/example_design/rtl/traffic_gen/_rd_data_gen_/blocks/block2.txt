Comment: 
This block is a data generator for the Spartan6 family of FPGA devices. Utilizing parameters like data transmission cycle (TCQ), address width, burst length (BL) width, data width (DWIDTH), data pattern, number of data exchange (DQ) pins, and column width, the generator produces data based on these specifications. Upon receipt of a system clock (clk_i) and a reset input (rst_i), the generator begins operation and becomes ready when data_rdy_i is high. It uses 'prbs_fseed_i' as the value for its pseudorandom binary sequence generator seed. Five different start commands can initiate the data generation. The block also accommodates for a fixed data input mode (fixed_data_i). The generated data is then routed via 'data_o', and its readiness is signaled by 'data_port_fifo_rdy'.
