    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for implementing the Reset and Interrupt Request (IRQ) logic in a hardware design. When a positive edge is detected on the Reset or Clock (Clk) input, the block is activated. If a Reset signal is detected, the IRQ receive end (irq_rxe) signal is set to low(0). If a receive end interrupt request (RxE_IRQ) is detected and there's no Reset signal present, the irq_rxe signal is set to high (1) after a propagation delay (Tp). Alternatively, if the write to the interrupt source register (INT_SOURCE_Wr at index [0]) is enabled and the Data input at index [3] is high, the irq_rxe signal is set to low (0) after a propagation delay (Tp). This controls the IRQ processing in the context of the hardware design."
