Comment: 
The provided block of code is responsible for defining a state machine and dictates different stages of operation, defining the behavior of variables 'addr_data_sel_n', 'load_shift_n', and 'nextstate' at each state. The state transitions are regulated based on conditions evaluated using control variables like 'cmd_valid', 'bit_cnt', and 'rd_not_write_reg'. Starting from the 'READY' state, the system goes through states like 'DECIDE', 'ADDR_PHASE', 'ADDR_TO_DATA_GAP', 'DATA_PHASE', and 'ALMOST_READY' based on certain conditions at each stage. Flags 'addr_data_sel_n' and 'load_shift_n' are systematically manipulated during this process. The state 'nextstate' is always set at every stage, providing an instruction for the next state transition. If no instructed case is applicable, the design defaults to the 'READY' state.
