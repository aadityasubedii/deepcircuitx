It supports different types of shift operations based on the functionality provided by the i_function control signal. The shift amount is defined by the i_shift_amount signal. This module also has a \"quick\" and \"full\" mode - the \"quick\" mode is considered when the shift amount is small (i_shift_amount[7:2] has no '1's), otherwise, it uses the \"full\" mode. The results of the operations and the data on if a shift operation might result in a carry are stored in o_out and o_carry_out respectively. If the module is in \"full\" mode and the shift amount is non-zero, a stall signal o_stall is set to indicate potential computational delay."
