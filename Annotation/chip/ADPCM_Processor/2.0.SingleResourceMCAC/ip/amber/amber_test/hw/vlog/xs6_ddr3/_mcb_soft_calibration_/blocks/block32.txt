This code block performs write operations on a memory cell using a Non-Termination (NTerm) reference address and signals when the operation is ready to proceed. It assigns the NTerm reference to the memory cell address location, selects write mode for operations, sets the write data, activates MCB's User Interface, and validates the MCB command. Then it conditionally makes a state transition: if MCB stays ready, the state remains on "LDQS_PIN_WRITE_N_TERM"; otherwise, it shifts to the waiting state "LDQS_PIN_N_TERM_WAIT".
