Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog RTL design is essentially a synchronously resettable state machine which controls the status flag, `BlockTxDone`. The signal `BlockTxDone` indicates whether transmission of a certain block is completed or not. The flag is reset to 0 when a `TxReset` signal is encountered or when a new frame transmission `TxStartFrmIn` is requested. Meanwhile, the flag is set to 1 when the `TxCtrlStartFrm` signal, which could mean the start of a controlled frame transmission, is encountered. Note that these operations are performed at the positive edge of `MTxClk` or `TxReset`, and delayed by the propagation delay time `Tp`.
