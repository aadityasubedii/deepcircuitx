    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is primarily about interfacing between design elements according to whether the `C_S1_AXI_ENABLE` parameter is set or not. If `C_S1_AXI_ENABLE` is not set, all input-output signals are simply passed through (assigned to corresponding inputs) in its parent design without any logic processing. If `C_S1_AXI_ENABLE` is enabled, the code does two main things. Firstly, it masks the bit width of address signals `s1_axi_araddr` and `s1_axi_awaddr` using `P_S1_AXI_ADDRMASK`. Secondly, it instantiates two modules - `mcb_ui_top_synch` and `axi_mcb` - for synchronizing the calibration state `uo_done_cal` and interfacing with MCB respectively. The instantiated MCB interface `p1_axi_mcb` accommodates and configures the AXI protocol features according to the provided constants and connects to corresponding input or output ports."
