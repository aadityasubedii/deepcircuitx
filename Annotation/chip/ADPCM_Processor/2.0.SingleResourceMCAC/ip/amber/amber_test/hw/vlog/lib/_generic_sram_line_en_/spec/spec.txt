Module name: generic_sram_line_en. 

Module specification: The 'generic_sram_line_en' module functions as a standard synchronous static random-access memory (SRAM) unit featuring both read and write ports. The SRAM unit is characterized by a memory array with configurable size (2^ADDRESS_WIDTH), initial value (INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO), and data width (DATA_WIDTH). The control inputs include 'reset' which initializes the output and internal memory, 'clk' which provides the clock signal for sequential operations, 'i_write_enable' that controls writing to memory, and 'i_address' which indicates the memory cell to be accessed. The module also has unused control inputs for diagnostic and testing operations (test_mode, scan_enable, scan_in0-4). The data inputs and outputs are the 'i_write_data' (write data input) and 'o_read_data' (read data output) respectively. Scanning output signals (scan_out0-4) for diagnostic and testing operations, not used in the current module, are also provided. Internally, a memory array 'mem' and a counter 'i' are used; 'mem' stores the data for SRAM operations while 'i' is used to iterate through 'mem' during reset operations. The code is structured into mainly two sections: the reset block which initializes the memory array and read data, and the normal operation block which controls SRAM read and write operations based on control signals. The module offers a simple synchronous SRAM functionality with support for future expansion in terms of diagnostic and testing capabilities.
