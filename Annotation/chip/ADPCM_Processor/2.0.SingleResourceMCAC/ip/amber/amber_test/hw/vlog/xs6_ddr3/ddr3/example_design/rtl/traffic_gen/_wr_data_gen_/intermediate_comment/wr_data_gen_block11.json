    "block_comment": "This block of code determines the readiness of a command. It uses a bitwise AND operation on 'cmd_rdy' and 'fifo_not_full' to do so. This means that the command is ready ('cmd_rdy_o' is high or '1') only if both conditions are met, i.e., if a command is indeed ready ('cmd_rdy' is high) and the FIFO buffer is not in its full state ('fifo_not_full' is high)."
