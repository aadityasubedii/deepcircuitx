    "block_comment": "The block of code is primarily involved in controlling the 'RetryLimit' signal based on specific conditions. On the rising edge of 'MTxClk' (Transmit Clock) or 'Reset', it sets the 'RetryLimit' to zero when a reset signal is encountered. However, if either 'StartTxDone' (Indicating that transmitting has finished) or 'StartTxAbort' (indicating that transmitting has been aborted) are high, it sets the 'RetryLimit' to the value of 'MaxCollisionOccured'."
