Comment: 
The block of code appears to be a conditional statement specifically designed to gate data clock based on readiness of FIFO, data and user burst count. If the `EYE_TEST` is set to "FALSE", the block of code assigns `data_clk_en` as the result of a logical operation. Specifically, it checks whether `fifo_rdy_i` and `data_rdy_i` are true, and whether `user_burst_cnt` is greater than 1. Should all these conditions be met the data clock is enabled.
