    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code essentially maps specific instruction patterns to corresponding values in the mtrans_reg register. Different values are assigned to mtrans_reg based on the position of the '1' bit in the instruction input from right to left, with each individual case statement corresponding to a distinct 16-bit instruction pattern ('1' bit at different positions). If none of the specified patterns are matched, a default value (4'hf) is assigned to mtrans_reg."
