    "block_comment": "This block deals with data reading and buffering operations, particularly for a pipeline stage in a digital system. The operation ensues upon a positive edge of the input clock. It implements delay-bounded buffering of incoming data and a specific control signal by using flip-flops. After a Transit Clock Cycle (TCQ), the read data ('data_i') is stored in 'rd_data_r'. This data is then successively buffered to 'rd_data_r2', 'rd_data_r3', and 'rd_data_r4' in subsequent clock cycles to form a pipeline. Also, the control signal 'wait_bl_end' is buffered to 'wait_bl_end_r1' after a TCQ."
