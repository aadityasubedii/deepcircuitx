    "block_comment": "This block is a procedure managing possible jumps in the execution of instructions within a hardware code. Upon every rising edge of the input clock signal and given a specific set of conditions, it records jump statements with their relevant details in a file. The conditions relate to ongoing instruction execution, absence of interruptions or stalls, and checks to avoid particular undesired states. Upon satisfying these constraints, it uses '$fwrite' function to write data into the file 'decompile_file'. It records the clock cycle at which the jump happened, the address where the execution is jumping from and to, and the values of the registers 0 and 1 during the jump. It uses utility functions like 'get_32bit_signal' and 'get_reg_val' for extracting the required data."
