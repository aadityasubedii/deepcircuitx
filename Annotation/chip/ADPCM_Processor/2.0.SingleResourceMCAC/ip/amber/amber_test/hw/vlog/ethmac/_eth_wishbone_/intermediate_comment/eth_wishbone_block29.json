    "block_comment": "This block is a shift control logic in a data receiver system. Implemented in edge-triggered fashion, the block reacts to a rising edge of two signals: WB_CLK_I or Reset. On the rise of Reset, it sets the ShiftEnded signal to low, initializing the state. On detecting condition from ShiftEndedSync3, MasterWbRX, m_wb_ack_i, RxBufferAlmostEmpty signals concurrently, it sets ShiftEnded high, indicating a finished shift operation. It also sets ShiftEnded low when RxStatusWrite signal goes high, allowing for the initiation of a new shift operation."
