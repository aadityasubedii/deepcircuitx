This code block is essentially used for initializing certain variables. It is setting four outputs: start_addr_o, end_addr_o, cmd_seed_o, and data_seed_o to their respective initial predefined values: BEGIN_ADDRESS, END_ADDRESS, CMD_SEED_VALUE, and DATA_SEED_VALUE. It's using 'assign' keyword to do continuous assignment, meaning the variables' values are instantly updated as soon as their right-hand-side expression changes. This block serves as an essential part of the initial setup for other operations that might rely on these variables.
