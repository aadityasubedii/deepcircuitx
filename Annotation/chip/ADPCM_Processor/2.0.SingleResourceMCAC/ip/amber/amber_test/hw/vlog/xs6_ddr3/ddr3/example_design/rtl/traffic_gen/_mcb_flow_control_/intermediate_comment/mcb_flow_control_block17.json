    "block_comment": "The block manages the output signals to the command, address, and burst length under certain conditions. It triggers with a rising edge clock signal. If the 10th bit of the reset `rst_i` signal is set, it resets `addr_o`, `cmd_o`, and `bl_o` to default. If the `xfer_cmd` signal is active and the `rst_i` is not active, the block assigns `addr_o` to `addr_reg`, `cmd_o` to either `cmd_reg` or to the concatenation of `2'b00` and the first bit of `cmd_reg` based on the value of `FAMILY`, and `bl_o` to `bl_reg`."
