    "block_comment": "This block is a parameterized instantiation of a `rd_data_gen` module that facilitates controlled data generation for a read operation in a memory system. The module utilized numerous parameters, which include the timing constraints (`TCQ`), the type of FPGA family (`FAMILY`), memory burst length (`MEM_BURST_LEN`), the number of data quality pins (`NUM_DQ_PINS`), the selection of the victim line (`SEL_VICTIM_LINE`), the data pattern to be read (`DATA_PATTERN`), memory data width (`DWIDTH`), and memory column width (`MEM_COL_WIDTH`). It interacts with the environment through its various input-output connections: clock (`clk_i`), reset (`rst_i`), PRBS seed (`prbs_fseed_i`), data mode (`data_mode_i`), command ready status (`cmd_rdy_o`), valid command (`cmd_valid_i`), last word status (`last_word_o`), fixed data input (`fixed_data_i`), address of the operation (`addr_i`), burst length (`bl_i`), data ready status (`data_rdy_i`), valid data (`data_valid_o`), output data (`data_o`), and read mdata enable signal (`rd_mdata_en`), which make it a versatile component for generating data for various read operations."
