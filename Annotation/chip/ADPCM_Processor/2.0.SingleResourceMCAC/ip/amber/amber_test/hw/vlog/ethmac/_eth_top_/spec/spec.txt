Module name: eth_top. Module specification: The eth_top module is the top-level module for an Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) implementation. It integrates various sub-modules to handle Ethernet communication, including transmit and receive operations, MAC control, MIIM (Management Interface), and Wishbone bus interface. The module has numerous input and output ports for Wishbone bus communication, Ethernet PHY interface, and optional BIST functionality. Key inputs include clocks, resets, data buses, and PHY signals, while outputs include data buses, control signals, and interrupt lines. Internal signals manage MIIM control, transmit and receive operations, flow control, and various status indicators. The module is composed of several main blocks: eth_miim for PHY management, eth_registers for configuration storage, eth_maccontrol for MAC-level control, eth_txethmac and eth_rxethmac for
