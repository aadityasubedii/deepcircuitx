    "block_comment": "The conditional block of code dynamically creates a named block, `SHIFT_VALUE`, if `DWIDTH` value is either 64 or 128. This is achieved using Verilog's 'generate' and 'if' constructs. These constructs allow the creation of different hardware structures based on parameters, like `DWIDTH` here. This capability is essential for creating flexible and reusable hardware components."
