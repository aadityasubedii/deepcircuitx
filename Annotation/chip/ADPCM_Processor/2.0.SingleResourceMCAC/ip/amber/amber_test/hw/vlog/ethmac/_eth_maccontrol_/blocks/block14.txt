Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is used to reset or set the 'TxUsedDataOutDetected' signal based on different input conditions. The 'TxUsedDataOutDetected' signal is set to '0' when 'TxReset' or either 'TxDoneIn' or 'TxAbortIn' signals are encountered at the positive edge of 'MTxClk'. This shows the end of a transmission or a system reset. On the other hand, if 'TxUsedDataOut' is encountered at the positive edge of 'MTxClk', 'TxUsedDataOutDetected' is set to '1', indicating that transmitted data is being utilized. The output delay '#Tp' is ensured in each case.
