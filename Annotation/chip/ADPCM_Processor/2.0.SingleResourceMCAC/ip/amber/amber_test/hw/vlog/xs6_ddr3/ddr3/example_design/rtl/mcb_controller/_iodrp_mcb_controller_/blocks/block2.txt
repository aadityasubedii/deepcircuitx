Comment: 
This block of code is a finite state machine handling different stages of data processing, including deciding, address phasing, data phasing, and transitioning between address and data stages. In each state, the block alters the behavior of addr_data_sel_n and load_shift_n signals and decides the next state based on certain conditions like cmd_valid, bit_cnt, and others. The finite state machine eases the control flow and aids in orderly data transmission or processing. Particularly, it seems to be part of a memory controller or similar system dealing with data load and addressing.
