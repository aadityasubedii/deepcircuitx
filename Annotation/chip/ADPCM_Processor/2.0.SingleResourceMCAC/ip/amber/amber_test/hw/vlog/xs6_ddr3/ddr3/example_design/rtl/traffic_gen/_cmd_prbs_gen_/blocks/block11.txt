The logic block generates a 64-bit pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) in response to an "ADDRESS" command. It activates when both the PRBS_CMD is "ADDRESS" and the PRBS_WIDTH is set to 64. This suggests the implementation of a conditional generate statement, providing the necessary hardware to generate a 64-bit sequence only when required, offering optimization of hardware according to system specifications.
