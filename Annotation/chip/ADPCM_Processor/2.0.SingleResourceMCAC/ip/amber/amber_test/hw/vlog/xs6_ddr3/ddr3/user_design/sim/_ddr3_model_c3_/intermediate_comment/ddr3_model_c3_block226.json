    "block_comment": "The function 'floor' performs a floor operation on a given real number input. If the given number is already an integer, it returns the number itself; if the given number is not an integer, it returns the largest integer less than the given number. This is achieved by comparing the input number with its integer value converted using the $rtoi function. If the real number is smaller than its integer form, it means that the number isn't an integer and thus, the function subtracts 1 from the converted integer to perform the floor operation."
