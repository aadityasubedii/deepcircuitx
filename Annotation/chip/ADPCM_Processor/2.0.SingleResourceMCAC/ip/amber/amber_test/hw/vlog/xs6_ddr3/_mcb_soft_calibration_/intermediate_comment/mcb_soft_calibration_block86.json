    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code serves as a timing or delay mechanism, specifically a counter that waits for 200 microseconds each time it is triggered by either the User Interface Clock (UI_CLK) or a Reset (RST) signal. On appearance of either signals, the WAIT_200us_COUNTER is created or updated. If a Reset signal is received, the counter is set to 16'h7FF0 during simulation or 0 otherwise. However, if the counter's 16th bit is not set, the counter increments by 1; otherwise, it retains its current value until the next rising edge of UI_CLK or RST."
