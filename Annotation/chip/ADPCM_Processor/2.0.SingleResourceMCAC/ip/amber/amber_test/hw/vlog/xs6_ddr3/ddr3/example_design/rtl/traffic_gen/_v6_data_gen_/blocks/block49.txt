Comment: 
This block of code serves as a data pattern generator for a system with 48 data pins. If the number of data pins (NUM_DQ_PINS) is 48 and the selected data pattern (DATA_PATTERN) is either "DGEN_NEIGHBOR", "DGEN_WALKING1", "DGEN_WALKING0", or "DGEN_ALL", this block will be activated. The block's operations are driven by the rising edge of the input clock signal (clk_i).
