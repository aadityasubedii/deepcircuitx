Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used to create an output buffer for a bidirectional data bus in a memory controller, provided the number of data pins, `C_NUM_DQ_PINS`, is equal to 16. The output buffer is instantiated from the `OBUFT` module and named `iob_udm`. It takes as input `ioi_udm` and `t_udm`, which presumably relate to the data line and tri-state control respectively, and drives the output `mcbx_dram_udm`. This conditional generation of the output buffer is likely part of a larger configuration for data bus widths in the context of a memory interface design.
