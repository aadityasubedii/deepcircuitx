    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for running the `cmd_addr_timing_check` function whenever there are changes to the 15th bit (index 14) of the `addr_in` bus. It employs the use of a change-sensitive `always` block to detect alterations in the specified bit position, subsequently calling the function with an input parameter of 21 to perform the designated timing check operation."
