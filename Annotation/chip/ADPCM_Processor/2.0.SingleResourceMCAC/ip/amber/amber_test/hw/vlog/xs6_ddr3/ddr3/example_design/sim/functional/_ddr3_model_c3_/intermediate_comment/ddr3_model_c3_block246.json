    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for implementing a delay line on the clock signal (ck). It uses a non-blocking assignment operator, indicated by \"<=\", which updates the 'ck_in' signal at every change of 'ck' signal state. The delay is defined by '#BUS_DELAY', a parameter which effectively sets the amount of delay between the source clock 'ck' and the destination 'ck_in'."
