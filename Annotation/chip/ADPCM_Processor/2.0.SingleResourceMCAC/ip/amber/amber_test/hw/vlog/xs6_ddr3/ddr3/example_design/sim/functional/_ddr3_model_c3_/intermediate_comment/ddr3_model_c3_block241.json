    "block_comment": "This block models a time delay in a circuit due to bus latency in signal transference. When the signal 'cas_n' changes, the event control statement 'always @' triggers the execution of the operation, where the value of 'cas_n' is assigned to the variable 'cas_n_in'. The assignment is delayed by an amount of time signified by 'BUS_DELAY'. This modeling of time delay is typically used in performance and timing accurate simulations."
