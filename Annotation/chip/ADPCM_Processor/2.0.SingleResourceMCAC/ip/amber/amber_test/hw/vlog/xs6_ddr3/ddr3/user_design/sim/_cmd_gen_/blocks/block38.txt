Comment: 
The block of code handles address mode registers depending on certain conditions. It will be triggered on the rising edge of the input clock signal. If the reset signal's third bit is high and the command pattern matches "CGEN_BRAM", the address mode register is set to "binary 000" after a delay defined by the time constant queue, represented by 'TCQ'. If the command pattern doesn't match "CGEN_BRAM", the address mode register is set to "binary 011". However, if the mode load pulse is high and the reset signal's third bit is not high, the address mode register is set to the value of the third bit of the input address mode signal after TCQ delay.
