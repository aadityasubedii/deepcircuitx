    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the registration of the input mode on the rising edge of the given clock. The implementation details of the block leverage a clock-based approach, meaning the 'instr_mode_i' signal is sent to the 'instr_mode_reg' register only after a positive edge is detected on the input clock signal (clk_i), and with a delay defined by the constant TCQ."
