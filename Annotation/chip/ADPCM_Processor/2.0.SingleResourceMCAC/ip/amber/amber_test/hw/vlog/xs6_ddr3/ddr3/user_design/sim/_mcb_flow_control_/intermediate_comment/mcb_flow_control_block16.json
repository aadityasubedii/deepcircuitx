    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is responsible for assigning input read and write addresses, as well as read bit lengths. Implementationally, it assigns the input \"addr_i\" to both the output write address \"wr_addr_o\" and the output read address \"rd_addr_o\". It also assigns the input bit length \"bl_i\" to the output read bit length \"rd_bl_o\"."
