Comment: 
This block of code is used for the activation control of the module clock divider circuit (MdcEn). The activation is dependent on the condition that the count equals zero (CountEq0) and the clock divider circuit is not currently active (~Mdc). The logical AND operation (&) guarantees that both conditions must be met for the clock divider enable signal (MdcEn) to be high or activated.
