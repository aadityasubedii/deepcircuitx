    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the behavior of the 'shift_through_reg' register, particularly how it reacts to different clock conditions and input signals. On a positive edge of the DRP_CLK clock signal, if the 'sync_rst' signal is active, the 'shift_through_reg' is reset to zero. If not, the 'load_shift_n' signal will decide whether to load the 'data_out_mux' output or perform a shift operation for the 'shift_through_reg' register. When shifting, the 'DRP_SDO' bit is inserted at the second position of the 'shift_through_reg' register and the rest of the bits are shifted right till the 7th bit."
