    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a statement block driving the ByteCnt register. On each positive edge of either the MTxClk or TxReset signals, the ByteCnt value gets updated based on conditions. If the TxReset or ResetByteCnt is high, ByteCnt gets reset to zero; otherwise, if IncrementByteCntBy2 & EnableCnt is high, ByteCnt gets its own value incremented by 2, or if IncrementByteCnt & EnableCnt is high, it gets incremented by 1. All changes to ByteCnt are delayed by Tp time units. This block essentially implements complex conditional counting and resetting functionality for ByteCnt."
