Module-level comment: The 'init_mem_pattern_ctr' module manages memory testing for FPGA families SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6. It uses a variety of inputs to control testing including address patterns, seed values, and operation modes. It maintains a finite state machine and handles state transitions, error conditions, and synchronization. Test execution is dictated through output control signals. Internal registers manage state, provide synchronization, and store operational parameters. Primary code blocks implement initialization, command issuance, error handling, and mode selection.
