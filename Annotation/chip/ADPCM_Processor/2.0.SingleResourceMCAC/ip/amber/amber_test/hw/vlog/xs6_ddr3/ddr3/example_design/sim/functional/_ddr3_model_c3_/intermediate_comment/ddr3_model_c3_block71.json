    "block_comment": "This block of code checks the timing of the 60th bit in a data input array. The `always @` construct specifies that the enclosed code should be executed whenever there are changes in the 60th data bit (`dq_in[59]`). The function `dq_timing_check(59)` is then called whenever there is a change, which checks the timing properties of the 60th bit."
