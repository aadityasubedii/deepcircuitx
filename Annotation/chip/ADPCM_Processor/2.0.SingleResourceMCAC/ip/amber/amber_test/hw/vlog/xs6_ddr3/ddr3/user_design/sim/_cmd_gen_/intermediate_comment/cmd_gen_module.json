    "module": "Module-level comment: This module generates memory commands (read, write, refresh) with configurable address patterns and burst lengths for various memory interfaces. It supports different memory types and families, implementing address generation (sequential, PRBS, fixed), instruction selection, and burst length determination based on input parameters and operating modes. The module manages timing and control signals for command generation, including ready/valid handshaking and refresh operations, using internal counters, PRBS generators, and state machines to achieve flexible and customizable command generation."
