This block of code is used to set the value of 'INC_COUNTS' based on the width of the data (DWIDTH). The code performs an asynchronous update of INC_COUNTS at the positive edge of clk_i (input clock). If DWIDTH is within the range [256, 576], the INC_COUNTS is set to 32. If the DWIDTH is within [128, 224], the INC_COUNTS is assigned 16. For DWIDTH  [64, 96], INC_COUNTS becomes 8. Finally, when DWIDTH is equal to 32, INC_COUNTS is 4.
