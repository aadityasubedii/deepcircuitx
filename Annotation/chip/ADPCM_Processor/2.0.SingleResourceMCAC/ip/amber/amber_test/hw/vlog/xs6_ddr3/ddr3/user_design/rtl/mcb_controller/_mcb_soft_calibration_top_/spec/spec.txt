Module name: mcb_soft_calibration_top. 

Module specification: The mcb_soft_calibration_top is a top-level module primarily responsible for implementing a soft calibration system in a memory controller. The module's functionality includes carrying out memory calibration, controlling self-refresh modes, handling signal delays, passing parameters to submodules like mcb_soft_calibration and IOBUF for specific operations, and dealing with refresh requirements. Its input ports include signals like UI_CLK, RST, IOCLK, PLL_LOCK, and several MCB_ prefix signals that contribute to the synchronization, resetting, monitoring, and controlling of calibration and self-refresh activities and data flow. Output ports like DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL, SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ, SELFREFRESH_MODE, MCB_UIADD, and many MCB_ prefix signals provide information about the end of calibration, mode, requests for self-refresh, and data control flow within a memory controller. These signals are useful for the follow-up stages. Internal signals like IODRP_ADD, IODRP_SDI, IODRP_SDO, RZQ_IODRP_SDO, and ZIO_IODRP_SDO, among others, are used for signaling internals of the module and manage operations like signal delay, data flow, impedance control, and timeout. The module is designed with several internal blocks such as always block, IOBUF block, and IODRP2 block, each having its specific functionality related to data flow, impedance control, and digital interface communications. These control data flow, signaling, and timing to provide the soft calibration functionality of the module in conjunction with external submodules used by the memory controller.
