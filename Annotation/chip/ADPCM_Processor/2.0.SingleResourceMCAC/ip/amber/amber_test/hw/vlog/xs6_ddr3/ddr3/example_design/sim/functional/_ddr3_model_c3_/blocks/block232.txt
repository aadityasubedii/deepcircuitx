Comment: 
This block of code generates a signal, 'diff_ck', that transitions on the positive edge of another signal, 'ck_n_in'. Whenever there is a positive edge detected on the 'ck_n_in' input signal, the 'diff_ck' output signal is assigned the inverted value of 'ck_n_in'. This implementation effectively makes the 'diff_ck' signal the negated, edge-triggered version of the input 'ck_n_in' signal.
