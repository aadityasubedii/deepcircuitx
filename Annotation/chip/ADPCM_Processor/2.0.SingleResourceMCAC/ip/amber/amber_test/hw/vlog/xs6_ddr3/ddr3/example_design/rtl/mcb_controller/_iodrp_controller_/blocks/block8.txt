Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is essentially a shift register clocked by the DRP_CLK signal. The shift register's main operation is predicated on the value of a synchronously reset signal (sync_rst). If this reset signal is true, all the bits in the register are set to zero. However, if the reset is not asserted, two conditions are considered. If the load_shift_n signal is true, the register is loaded with the value from the data_out_mux signal, serving as a parallel load functionality. If the load_shift_n signal is false, the register performs a shift right operation where the DRP_SDO is the new most significant bit, and the rest bits are filled by shifting the old values inside the register one position right.
