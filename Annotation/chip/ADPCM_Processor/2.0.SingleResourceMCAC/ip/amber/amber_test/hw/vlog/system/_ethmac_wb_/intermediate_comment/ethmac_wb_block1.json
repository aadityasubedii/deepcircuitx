    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for data routing in a Wishbone bus system. The implementation is done using the assign keyword in Verilog, where outputs are directly assigned from corresponding inputs such as acknowledgment signals, error signals, address data, write enable signal, and strobe signals. These functionalities facilitate the successful execution of read and write operations under a protocol-governed operation of the Wishbone interface."
