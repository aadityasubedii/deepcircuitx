The function of this block is to assign the correct byte length to the variable 'TxValidBytes' depending on the transmission length 'TxLength'. This block implements a conditional statement that checks if the transmission length is less than 4 ('TxLengthLt4'), it assigns the last two bits of 'TxLength' to 'TxValidBytes'. If 'TxLengthLt4' is not true, it assigns '2'b0' which is binary for 0.
