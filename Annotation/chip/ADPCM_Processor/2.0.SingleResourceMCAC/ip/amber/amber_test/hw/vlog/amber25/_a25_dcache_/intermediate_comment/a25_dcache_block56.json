    "block_comment": "This block of code plays a role in synchronization in a synchronous digital system. It particularly delineates a request reset functionality. When a positive edge of the reset signal or clock cycle is detected, the block gets triggered. If the reset signal is high, it resets the 'request_r' register to zero. In the absence of a reset signal, the register gets updated with the logical AND result of the prior stored value or a new 'request_pulse' and the 'o_stall' signal."
