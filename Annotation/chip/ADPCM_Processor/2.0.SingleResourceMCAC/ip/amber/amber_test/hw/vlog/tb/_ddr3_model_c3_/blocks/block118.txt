Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog is executing a function called dq_timing_check when there is a change in the 12th bit of the input vector dq_in. The function dq_timing_check, which is not shown here, is likely to perform timing verification or validation on the provided bit index (in this case, 12). This is performed by using the always @() construct in Verilog, which triggers the block inside whenever the given condition - a change in dq_in[12] in this case - occurs.
