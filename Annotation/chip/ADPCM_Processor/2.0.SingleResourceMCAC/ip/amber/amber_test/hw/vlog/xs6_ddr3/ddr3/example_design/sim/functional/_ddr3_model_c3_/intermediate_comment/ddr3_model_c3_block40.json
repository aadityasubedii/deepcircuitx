    "block_comment": "The block of code triggers a timing check on the falling edge of signal 'dqs_in[25]'. Using an 'always' block, a procedure named 'dqs_pos_timing_check' is scheduled with the argument '25' every time the signal 'dqs_in[25]' goes from high to low (negative edge). This effectively checks if the data is appropriately timed with the 'dqs_in[25]' signal phase."
