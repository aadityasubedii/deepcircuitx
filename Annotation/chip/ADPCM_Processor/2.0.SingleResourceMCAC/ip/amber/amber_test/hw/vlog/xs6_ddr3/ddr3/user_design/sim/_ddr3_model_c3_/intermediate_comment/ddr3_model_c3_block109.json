    "block_comment": "[Function of the block] This block of Verilog code is designed to perform a timing check function anytime there is a change on the 22nd bit (index 21) of the 'dq_in' input vector. [Implementation details of the block] The always@ construct ensures that the timing check function is activated each time there is a change in the state of the specified bit. The syntax 'dq_timing_check(21)' indicates that the function 'dq_timing_check' is called with the argument being the index of the bit to check within our 'dq_in' vector."
