    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a synchronous edge-triggered D flip-flop chain for signal debouncing or synchronization. On every positive edge of the 'WB_CLK_I' clock signal, the state of the 'Busy_IRQ_rck' signal is sampled and propagated through a chain of flip-flops ('Busy_IRQ_sync1', 'Busy_IRQ_sync2', and 'Busy_IRQ_sync3'). This mechanism aids in handling signal stability issue by removing signal glitches or noise."
