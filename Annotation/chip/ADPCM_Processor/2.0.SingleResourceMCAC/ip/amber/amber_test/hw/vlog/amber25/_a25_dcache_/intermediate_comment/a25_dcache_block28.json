    "block_comment": "This code block assigns the 'data_hit_way' signal for a specific index 'i'. This is achieved by performing a logical AND operation between the most significant bit of the 'tag_rdata_way' at index 'i' and corresponding 'TAG_WIDTH'. This operation checks if the tag data matches with the stored tag data of a specific cache set (data_hit_way[i]) when cache is accessed."
