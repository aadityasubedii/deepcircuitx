    "block_comment": "The block initializes a generate-if construct, conditioned on the number of data query (DQ) pins, and tests for different data patterns. When the number of DQ pins equals to 64 and the data pattern is either \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\", the block activates. This activation triggers an always block in the synchronized to a positive edge of input clock, indicating how the module handles specific conditions depending on the number of pins and data pattern."
