    "block_comment": "The block generates addresses and data for a write command when either the readiness signal of the FIFO is high or the start command is triggered. When the Start command is triggered and the data selection flag for data generation is high, the block generates a sequence of 32 bit data addressed over 32 cycles, with the actual values based on a specific data generation function depending on the data_mode input. For each case, if the data_mode equals 'b0101, Data_Gen function is called, otherwise, Data_GenW0 is. The data is then loaded into the wire w1data in each cycle conditionally. If none of the cases match, w1data is set to zero."
