Comment: 
This Verilog RTL block, 'initialize', is used to initialize an array of mode registers. This is achieved by executing a series of command tasks. If the debug mode is on, an initialization message is displayed that includes the simulation time. A 'NOP' (No Operation) command is firstly initiated, then a 'ZQ' command followed by multiple loads of mode registers. The base address for each mode register load is sequentially assigned from 3 to 0 while the load is performed with the register itself or an added hexadecimal value. A 'NOP' command is again issued once the register loading is complete.
