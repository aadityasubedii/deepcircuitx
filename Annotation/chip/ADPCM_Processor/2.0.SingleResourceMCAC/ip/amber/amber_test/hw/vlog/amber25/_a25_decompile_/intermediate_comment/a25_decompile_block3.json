    "block_comment": "The function `get_4bit_signal` retrieves a 4-bit signal based on a 3-bit input value `num`. Depending on the value of `num`, it interfaces with different system elements: if `num` is `3'd0`, it uses the `o_byte_enable` signal from `U_EXECUTE`; if `num` is `3'd1`, it uses the `mem_load_rd_r` signal from `U_WB`. Other input values for `num` are not covered, and the result of `get_4bit_signal` for those cases is not defined within this function. Thus, the function facilitates dynamic referencing of system-level 4-bit signals based on a 3-bit identifier."
