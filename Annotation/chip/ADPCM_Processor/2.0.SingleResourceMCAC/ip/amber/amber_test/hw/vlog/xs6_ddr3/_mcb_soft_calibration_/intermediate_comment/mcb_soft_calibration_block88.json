    "block_comment": "This block is a circuit-based latch that is triggered on the rising edge of the UI_CLK. The latch essentially checks if the calibration for both software and hardware has finished based on certain conditions defined in the Verilog code. Depending on the state of three inputs \u2013 DQS_DELAY_INITIAL, STATE, and MCB_UODONECAL, the output of DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL is set. If DQS_DELAY_INITIAL is not '00' or the STATE has reached 'DONE', and MCB_UODONECAL is true, then the output (DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL) is set true indicating that the calibration process is complete. The operation happens synchronously with the UI_CLK."
