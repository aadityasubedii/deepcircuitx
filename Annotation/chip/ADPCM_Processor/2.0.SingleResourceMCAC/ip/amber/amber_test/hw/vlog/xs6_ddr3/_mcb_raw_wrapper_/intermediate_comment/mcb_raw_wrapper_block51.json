    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for the assignment of memory interface generator (MIG) control signals. The first part of the block assigns various MIG properties from `p1` and/or `p0` to `p0`, such as command full, write full, and read count. These properties reflect the memory state held at MIG channels `p0` and `p1`. The second part of the block, under 'else', assigns several MIG control signals related to command clock, command enable and address signals to logic low. These assignments are used to disable the command interface of channel `p0`."
