The block enables data comparison based on input 'data_rdy' signal. Specifically, upon every positive edge of the clock signal 'clk_i', the 'cmp_data_en' signal gets assigned with the delayed value of 'data_rdy'. This delay is defined by the constant #TCQ, simulating the timing check quantity. This block is a typical example of sequential logic in Verilog RTL design.
