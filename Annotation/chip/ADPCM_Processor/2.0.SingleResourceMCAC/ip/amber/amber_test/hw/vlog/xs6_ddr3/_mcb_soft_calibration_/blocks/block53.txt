Comment: 
The block sets up a Write operation for controlling an IO DRAM resistor impedance. It starts by setting a command valid, then sets the address and write data, and finally selects the write mode. If the controller is not busy, the state stays the same, waiting for the operation to complete. If it's busy, the state transitions to the WAIT2 state until resources become available.
