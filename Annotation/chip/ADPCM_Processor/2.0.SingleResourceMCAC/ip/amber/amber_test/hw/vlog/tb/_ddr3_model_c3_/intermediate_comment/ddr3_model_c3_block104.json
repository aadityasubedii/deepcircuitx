    "block_comment": "This block of code activates a timing check procedure for digital signal of index 26 in the 'dq_in' bus. It does this using an 'always' block, which is triggered anytime there is a change in the signal state of dq_in[26]; upon this trigger, the 'dq_timing_check' function with respective index 26 is called for execution, essentially assessing and ensuring proper timing parameters for the digital signal at this index."
