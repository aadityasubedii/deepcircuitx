This block performs the role of a resettable flip-flop, controlling the full-status of a read data FIFO. Upon a positive edge of the clock signal, this block is activated. If the reset signal is high, it resets the 'rd_mdata_afull_set' signal immediately making it low, which signifies that the FIFO is not full. If the reset is not active but the FIFO is full, 'rd_mdata_afull_set' becomes high after a delay specified by #TCQ which signifies that the FIFO is full.
