Comment: 
The block initiates an instantiation of the module `mcb_flow_control` with two parameters, `TCQ` and `FAMILY`. The parameter `TCQ` specifies the transaction queue depth, and `FAMILY` identifies the device family. This setup allows the module to provide flow control for memory controller blocks (MCBs), where operations are tailored per device family and queue depth.
