    "block_comment": "This block is designed to increment a counter called `INC_COUNTS` under certain conditions. When the clock signal `clk_i` is at a positive edge and `mem_init_done` is HIGH, `INC_COUNTS` is incremented by a value proportional to `bl_out_reg`. However, if `mem_init_done` is not HIGH, the increment is based on `fixed_bl_i`. If `fixed_bl_i` is zero, then the increment will be equivalent to the value of `DWIDTH` divided by 8, multiplied by 64; otherwise, it will be `DWIDTH/8` multiplied by `fixed_bl_i`. The increment will be delayed by the timescaled constant `#TCQ`."
