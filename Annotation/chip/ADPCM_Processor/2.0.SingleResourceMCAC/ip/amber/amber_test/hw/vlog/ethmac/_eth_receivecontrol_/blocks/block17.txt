This block is a latch managing the value of a timer in a receiver sub-system upon specific conditions. Upon every positive edge of the receive clock signal (`MRxClk`) or the reset signal (`RxReset`), its behavior is carried out. If a reset occurs, the `LatchedTimerValue` is reset to zero utilizing a delay of `#Tp`. Alternatively, if a detection window is true, a pause frame is being received, and byte count equals 18, the `LatchedTimerValue` is updated with a newer `AssembledTimerValue` with the same delay. Lastly, when a receive operation ends, the `LatchedTimerValue` is also reset to zero.
