Module-level comment: The a25_coprocessor is a controller for an ARM A25 processor, responsible for cache management including operations such as read/write of cache data, handling of fault conditions, and defining memory areas for cache. Major inputs are control signals for operations and fault, memory addresses and data, while outputs primarily include read data and cache control signals. Internally, registers record fault information and configure memory areas. The functionality is implemented using combinational and sequential logic, with system clock and reset controlling synchronization and initial state. Debugging facilities provide state information tracing for fault diagnosis.
