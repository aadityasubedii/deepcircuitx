    "block_comment": "This Verilog block monitors and reports any reset pulse width violations. It gets triggered at the positive edge of the input reset signal. If the simulation time exceeds 100000 units, it checks whether the reset pulse width is less than the expected 100000 units by comparing the current simulation time with the time when the previous reset signal edge occurred. If a violation is detected, it displays an error message with the time of violation and how much the actual reset pulse width deviated from the expected value. The timestamp of the latest reset signal edge is recorded for use in the next check."
