    "block_comment": "This block of code incrementally counts the DRP clock cycles when the program is operating in either the Address Phase or the Data Phase, provided that the 'sync_rst' flag is not set. The counter is implemented using an always block that triggers on the positive edge of the DRP clock signal. If the current state is either 'ADDR_PHASE' or 'DATA_PHASE' and the reset condition ('sync_rst') is not active, the bit counter ('bit_cnt') is incremented by 1. Otherwise, in any other state or if a reset condition is initiated, the counter is reset to zero."
