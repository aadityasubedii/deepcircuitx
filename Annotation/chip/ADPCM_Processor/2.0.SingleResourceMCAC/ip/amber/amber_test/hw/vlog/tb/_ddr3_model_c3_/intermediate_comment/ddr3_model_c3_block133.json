    "block_comment": "This block initializes a timing check process which is contingent on the 15th bit (from 0) of the `dm_in` data stream. Technically, it invokes the `dm_timing_check` function whenever there's an alteration in the particular bit. The number 14 passed to the function indicates that it's the bit in question that triggers the function call."
