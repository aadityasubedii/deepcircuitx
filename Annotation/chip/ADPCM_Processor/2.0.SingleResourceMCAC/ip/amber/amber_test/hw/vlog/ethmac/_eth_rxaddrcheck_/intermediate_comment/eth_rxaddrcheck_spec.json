    "spec": "Module name: eth_rxaddrcheck \n\nModule specification:\n\nThe eth_rxaddrcheck module serves a crucial role in Ethernet communication, ensuring data integrity by verifying the validity of the destination MAC address of an incoming Ethernet frame. It discerns whether the frame is a broadcast, multicast, or unicast frame and validates these based on certain conditions. This module operates on the positive edge of the clock (MRxClk) or at a reset (Reset).\n\nKey input ports include MRxClk (the system clock), Reset (resets the module), RxData (incoming Ethernet frame), Broadcast, r_Bro, r_Pro (control signals), ByteCntEq2 to ByteCntEq7 (signifiers of byte count conditions), HASH0 and HASH1 (hash values for multicast frame validation), CrcHash and CrcHashGood (CRC hash values for frame checking), Multicast, MAC (Mac Address for unicast validation), StateData (current state of data), RxEndFrm (end of frame signal), PassAll (control signal), and ControlFrmAddressOK (control frame's address validity). \n\nThe module outputs two main signals: RxAbort, which signals an abort of the frame reception due to address invalidity, and AddressMiss, triggered when the address fails to be recognized as either unicast, multicast, or broadcast.\n\nInternal signals used include BroadcastOK (indicates valid broadcast frame), RxAddressInvalid (shows unsuccessful address checks), RxCheckEn (enables check for frames), HashBit (holds hashing result), IntHash and ByteHash (involved in hash selection for multicast validation), MulticastOK and UnicastOK (indicate validation success of multicast and unicast frames respectively), and internal RxAbort and AddressMiss registers to hold the status of the output signals.\n\nThe code is organized into several blocks, primarily 'always' blocks, which are evaluated at every positive edge of the clock or during a reset. These blocks define the operations of the module, including the multicast, unicast checks, hash selection for multicast validation, and setting the status of output signals. They perform the core functionality of the Ethernet frame address checking process.",

The actions in the module are executed at the positive edge of this clock signal.\n2. Reset: This signal is used to reset the state of the module.\n3. RxData[7:0]: This is the incoming Ethernet frame data that the module checks.\n4. Broadcast: This signal indicates if the incoming Ethernet frame is a broadcast message or not.\n5. r_Bro, r_Pro: These are control signals that are uses in the module logic.\n6. ByteCntEq2 to ByteCntEq7: These signals represent certain conditions of the byte count in the frame. \n7. HASH0[31:0] and HASH1[31:0]: These are hash values used for checking the validity of the multicast frame.\n8. CrcHash[5:0]: These are computed CRC hash values used for checking the received frame.\n9. CrcHashGood: This signal indicates if the computed CRC hash is valid or not.\n10.

The inputs provide the necessary data and control signals on which the module operates, while the outputs give the outcomes based on internal logic conditions. In this particular module, the inputs are related to the incoming Ethernet frame, its properties, and some control signals.

It discerns whether the frame is a broadcast, multicast, or unicast frame and validates these based on certain conditions. This module operates on the positive edge of the clock (MRxClk) or at a reset (Reset).\n\nKey input ports include MRxClk (the system clock), Reset (resets the module), RxData (incoming Ethernet frame), Broadcast, r_Bro, r_Pro (control signals), ByteCntEq2 to ByteCntEq7 (signifiers of byte count conditions), HASH0 and HASH1 (hash values for multicast frame validation), CrcHash and CrcHashGood (CRC hash values for frame checking), Multicast, MAC (Mac Address for unicast validation), StateData (current state of data), RxEndFrm (end of frame signal), PassAll (control signal), and ControlFrmAddressOK (control frame's address validity). \n\nThe module outputs two main signals: RxAbort, which signals an abort of the frame reception due to address invalidity, and AddressMiss, triggered when the address fails to be recognized as either unicast, multicast, or broadcast.\n\nInternal signals used include BroadcastOK (indicates valid broadcast frame), RxAddressInvalid (shows unsuccessful address checks), RxCheckEn (enables check for frames), HashBit (holds hashing result), IntHash and ByteHash (involved in hash selection for multicast validation), MulticastOK and UnicastOK (indicate validation success of multicast and unicast frames respectively), and internal RxAbort and AddressMiss registers to hold the status of the output signals.\n\nThe code is organized into several blocks, primarily 'always' blocks, which are evaluated at every positive edge of the clock or during a reset. These blocks define the operations of the module, including the multicast, unicast checks, hash selection for multicast validation, and setting the status of output signals. They perform the core functionality of the Ethernet frame address checking process."
