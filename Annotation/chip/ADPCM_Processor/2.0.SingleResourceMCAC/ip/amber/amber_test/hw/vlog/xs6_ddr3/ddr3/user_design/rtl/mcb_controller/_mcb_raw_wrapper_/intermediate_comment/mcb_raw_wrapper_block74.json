    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code controls the assignments for a memory interface (MIG) related to Port 1 under different conditions. If the control signal `C_PORT_ENABLE[1]` is high, the signals like `mig_p1_arb_en`, `mig_p1_cmd_clk` etc., are assigned values corresponding to their respective signals like `p1_arb_en`, `p1_cmd_clk` etc., including a specific block length assignment `mig_p1_cmd_bl` crafted from `p1_cmd_instr` and `p1_cmd_bl`. On the other hand, if `C_PORT_ENABLE[1]` is not high, all these signals are assigned a low value, effectively disabling any operation through Port 1."
