This block of code is a data output multiplexer function for an integrated circuit, specifically automated with DRP versioning. For different DRP versions, it provides logic for processing 'data_out' based on the 'drp_ioi_addr' status. In v1_0_FIX, 'data_out_mux' is selectively bit shifted depending on the specific IOI_DQ address or pin configuration. Under other conditions, 'data_out_mux' simply equals 'data_out'. The default condition ensures 'data_out_mux' equals 'data_out' if none of the outlined IOI_DQs apply.
