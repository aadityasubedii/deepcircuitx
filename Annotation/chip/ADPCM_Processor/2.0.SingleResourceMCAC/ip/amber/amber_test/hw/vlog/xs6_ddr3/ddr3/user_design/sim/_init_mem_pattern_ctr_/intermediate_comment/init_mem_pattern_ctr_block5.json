    "block_comment": "The block of code is for setting specific modes for data and address under certain conditions. It's activated on the rising edge of the input clock. If the reset input is enabled, it sets 'DATA_MODE' as the data mode and binary '11' as the address mode. If reset is not enabled, but the 'vio_modify_enable' signal is set, it then assigns the data mode select and address mode select values based upon the specific bits from 'syn1_vio_data_mode_value' and 'vio_addr_mode_value' respectively."
