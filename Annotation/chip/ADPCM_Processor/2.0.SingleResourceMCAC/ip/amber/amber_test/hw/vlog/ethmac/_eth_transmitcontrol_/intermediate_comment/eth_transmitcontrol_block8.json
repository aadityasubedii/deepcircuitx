    "block_comment": "This block assigns the signal 'ResetByteCnt' based on some conditions from transmitting inputs. It will reset the byte counter, 'ResetByteCnt', when the transmitter is reset 'TxReset' or when the transmission is not starting a frame 'TxCtrlStartFrm' and it either finishes transmitting 'TxDoneIn' or it has to abort the transmission 'TxAbortIn'. The operations are achieved via logical OR and AND operators to combine the conditions."
