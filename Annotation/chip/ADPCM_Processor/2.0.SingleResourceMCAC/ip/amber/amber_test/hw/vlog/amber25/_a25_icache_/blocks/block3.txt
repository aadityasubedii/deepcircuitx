This block of Verilog code is a conditional statement that checks if the variable WAYS equals 8, and then executes a code section named check_hit_8ways. The purpose of the block is to perform some operation specific to an 8-way set associative cache, although the specific operation itself is not revealed in this snippet. The check is implemented as an else-if clause, indicating that there may be preceding conditions handling other numbers of ways. The subsequent code in the check_hit_8ways section, not shown in this snippet, will execute if WAYS equals 8.
