Module name: xs6_sram_512x128_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 512x128-bit SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA primitives. It utilizes four RAMB16BWER blocks to create a 128-bit wide memory with 512 addresses. The module has input ports for clock (i_clk), write data (i_write_data), write enable (i_write_enable), address (i_address), and byte enable (i_byte_enable), and an output port for read data (o_read_data). Internally, it uses signals nc24_00, nc24_01, nc24_02, nc24_03 (unused outputs from RAMB16BWER primitives) and wea (for write enable control).
