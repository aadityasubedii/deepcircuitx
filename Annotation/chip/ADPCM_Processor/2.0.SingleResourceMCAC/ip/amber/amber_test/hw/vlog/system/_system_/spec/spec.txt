Module name: system. Module specification: The system module is a top-level design for an embedded system integrating various components including an Amber processor core (A23 or A25), memory interfaces, peripherals, and a Wishbone bus interconnect. It handles input/output operations, clock and reset management, and supports different configurations for FPGA or ASIC implementations. The module has numerous input ports for control signals, clocks, and data inputs; output ports for memory control, UART, Ethernet, and LED outputs; and inout ports for bidirectional signals like DDR3 memory interfaces. Internal signals manage system clock, reset, memory controller interactions, Wishbone bus communications, and interrupt handling. The code is structured into several blocks including clock/reset management, processor core instantiation, Ethernet controller, memory interfaces (boot and main memory), UART controllers, test module, timer module, interrupt controller, DDR3 memory
