    "block_comment": "This line of code in Verilog is managing the reset operation of a byte counter in a data communication protocol. It performs the reset by assigning the \"RxEndFrm\" signal to \"ResetByteCnt\". If \"RxEndFrm\" is true (usually at the end of a received data frame), the byte count would be reset, clearing the count to prepare for the next data frame."
