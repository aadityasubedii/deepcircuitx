    "block_comment": "This block manages the assignment of various input and output signals related to a 5th channel AXI interface when it's disabled. These signals are part of three main modules: command, writing, and reading module. The control signals such as 'p5_arb_en', 'p5_cmd_clk', 'p5_cmd_en', and the data signals like 'p5_cmd_instr', 'p5_cmd_bl' are assigned to their respective input counterparts. The status signals of these modules, like 'p5_cmd_empty', 'p5_cmd_full', 'p5_wr_full', and 'p5_wr_empty', are assigned from their respective internal signals. Similar assignments are done for 'wr' and 'rd' modules. This block helps facilitate various operations such as writing/reading commands and data, and checking statuses such as overflow and error."
