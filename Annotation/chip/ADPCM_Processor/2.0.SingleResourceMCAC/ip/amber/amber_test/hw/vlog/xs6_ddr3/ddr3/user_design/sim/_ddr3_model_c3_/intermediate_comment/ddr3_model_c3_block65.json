    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates a DQS positive edge timing check with the rising edge of the DQS signal. This always block listens to a specific index (0 in this case) of the 'dqs_in' signal array and calls the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function passing '0' as the argument whenever a positive edge, i.e. transition from low to high, is detected in the 'dqs_in[0]' signal. This logic is primarily used for synchronization in FPGA or other digital designs dealing with data transmission or memory interface."
