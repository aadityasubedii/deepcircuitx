The block's function is to monitor and act upon the negative edge of the 14th bit in the 'dqs_in' bus. This is done by calling the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' routine whenever a falling edge on the 14th bit signal of 'dqs_in' bus is detected. The passed parameter '13' to the routine specifies the exact bit in the bus array that the always block is reacting to, providing increased modularity and ease of code modification.
