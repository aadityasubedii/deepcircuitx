    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a timing check on the write enable signal. Using an always block, which is edge-sensitive in Verilog, it triggers the function `cmd_addr_timing_check(3)` whenever there's a change in the `we_n_in` net, which appears to represent a write enable signal in negative logic. This suggests a function dedicated to ensuring the write enable signal changes meet certain timing requirements to ensure correct operation of the broader design. Any violation of these requirements would presumably result in a warning or error."
