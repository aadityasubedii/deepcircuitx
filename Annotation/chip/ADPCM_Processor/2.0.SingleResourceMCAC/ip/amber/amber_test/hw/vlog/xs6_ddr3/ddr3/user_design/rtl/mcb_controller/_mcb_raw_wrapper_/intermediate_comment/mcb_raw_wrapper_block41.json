    "block_comment": "The line of code assigns the signal 'ui_clk' to 'mcb_ui_clk'. This operation is basically assigning the value of 'ui_clk' to 'mcb_ui_clk', creating a link between these two signals. When 'ui_clk' signal changes, the change will also reflect on 'mcb_ui_clk', hence they share the same state. This operation is implemented using the 'assign' keyword, a continuous assignment statement in Verilog RTL coding used primarily to assign values to wires."
