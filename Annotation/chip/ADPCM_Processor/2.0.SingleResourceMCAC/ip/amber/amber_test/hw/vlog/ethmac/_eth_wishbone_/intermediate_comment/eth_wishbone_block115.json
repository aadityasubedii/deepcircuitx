    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for aligning the signal TxStartFrm_sync1 with MTxClk and resetting it. It relies on an edge-triggered always block to check for a rising edge on either the MTxClk or Reset signals. If Reset is high, it asynchronously assigns a 0 to TxStartFrm_sync2 in the next positive edge of MTxClk. If not in Reset state, TxStartFrm_sync2 acquires the value of TxStartFrm_sync1 in synchrony with MTxClk's positive edge."
