    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a triggering mechanism in a Verilog circuit simulation. Whenever there is a change in the 3rd bit of the 'dq_in' signal array, it invokes a procedure named 'dq_timing_check()' and passes '2' as the argument, likely implying it performs a timing check specific to this bit of the signal. This design allows for event-driven checks, enhancing the real-time simulation accuracy of the design behavior."
