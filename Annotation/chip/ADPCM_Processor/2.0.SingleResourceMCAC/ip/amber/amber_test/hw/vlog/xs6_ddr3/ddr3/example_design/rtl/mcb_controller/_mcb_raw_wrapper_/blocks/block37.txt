This block of Verilog code initializes a timer and displays a message. It's executed at the start of simulation, setting the `wait_200us_counter` to its maximum value, effectively skipping a 200 microsecond wait period. The `$display` system task is then used to print a message to the console, notifying the user that the wait period before Clock Enable (CKE) activation has been skipped for simulation purposes.
