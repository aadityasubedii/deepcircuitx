Comment: 
This block of code performs a delay operation on the 'cs_n' signal. The 'always' keyword in Verilog signalizes that the code inside this block is to be run whenever there is any change in the 'cs_n' input. The '<=' sign is a non-blocking assignment which schedules the value on the right-hand side (RHS) to be assigned to the left-hand side (LHS) delay specified by the '#BUS_DELAY'. Specifically, the block will delay the 'cs_n' signal by an amount specified by 'BUS_DELAY'.
