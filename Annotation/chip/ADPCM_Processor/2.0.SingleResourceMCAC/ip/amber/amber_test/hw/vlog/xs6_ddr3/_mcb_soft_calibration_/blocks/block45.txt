Comment: 
The block of code primarily functions as a state machine step, specifically denoted as the 'INC_NTERM' state. Upon entering this state, the 'N_Term' register value is incremented by one, and the next state is updated to 'LOAD_ZIO_NTERM'. The block accomplishes its function through a combination of sequential and combinational logic: an arithmetic operation is used to increment the value of 'N_Term' and the state is assigned in a combinational manner to 'LOAD_ZIO_NTERM'.
