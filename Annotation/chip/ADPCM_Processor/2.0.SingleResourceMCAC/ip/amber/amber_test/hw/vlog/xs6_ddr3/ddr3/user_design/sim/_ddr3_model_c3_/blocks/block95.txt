Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for invoking the `dq_timing_check` procedure when an input on the 36th pin of the `dq_in` bus changes. This is achieved through the always block that listens for a change in the value of `dq_in[35]`, and triggers the `dq_timing_check` function with the argument `35` once the event is detected. The function serves as a data integrity and timing verification mechanism specific to this pin.
