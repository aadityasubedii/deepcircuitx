    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'eth_rxstatem' is a state machine that manages the Ethernet frame receiving process. It uses input signals to decide state transitions, reflecting different phases of the frame reception. Internally, 'StartX' signals drive the state transitions, computed in 'assign' statements, and the current states are managed in an 'always' block. 'StateData' provides the current state concisely."
