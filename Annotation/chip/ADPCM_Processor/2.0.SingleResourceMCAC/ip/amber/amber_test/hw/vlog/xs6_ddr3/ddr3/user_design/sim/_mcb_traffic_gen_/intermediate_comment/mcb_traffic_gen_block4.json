    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to set the signal 'cmp_error' to a logic low value. In Verilog, the assign keyword is used for continuous assignments which are used to drive wires with combinational logic. Here, assign cmp_error = 1'b0; means that the signal 'cmp_error' is continuously assigned with the value 0, indicating it will hold a logic low or false value until it is reassigned. This is a simple definition of a combinational logic signal in a digital logic design context. This means that the 'cmp_error' signal doesn't hold any error state at this moment and it will remain false continuously until it's reassigned in the logic anywhere later in the program."
