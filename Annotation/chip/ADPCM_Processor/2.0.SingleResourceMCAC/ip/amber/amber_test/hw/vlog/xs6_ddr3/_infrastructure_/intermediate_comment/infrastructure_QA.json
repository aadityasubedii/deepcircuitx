Its purpose is to generate multiple clock signals, manage reset signals, and maintain clocking modules under various conditions. It fetches inputs like different system clocks and a system reset signal, and other parameters used for dividing or managing clocks. It generates various output clocks, reset signals, clock signals, phase-locked-loop controls among other signals, all managed depending on the input signal conditions. Different buffer modules and conditions ensure the conforming output is delivered. This module is essential for managing system timing and ensuring stable operation of RTL designs."
