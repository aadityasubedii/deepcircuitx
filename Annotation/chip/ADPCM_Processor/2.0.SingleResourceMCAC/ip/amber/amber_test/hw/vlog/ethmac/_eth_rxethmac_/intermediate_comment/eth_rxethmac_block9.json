    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing the Broadcasting signal based on various conditions. It is always activated on the positive edge of MRxClk signal or the Reset signal. If the Reset signal is positive, the 'Broadcast' signal is set to 0 with a propagation delay '#Tp'. Otherwise, the code handles three different cases to determine the 'Broadcast' value. The cases depend on three conditions involving 'StateData[0]', 'LatchedByte[7:0]', 'ByteCntSmall7', 'ByteCntEq1', 'RxAbort' and 'RxEndFrm'. According to these cases, it sets the 'Broadcast' signal to 0 or 1 with a propagation delay '#Tp'."
