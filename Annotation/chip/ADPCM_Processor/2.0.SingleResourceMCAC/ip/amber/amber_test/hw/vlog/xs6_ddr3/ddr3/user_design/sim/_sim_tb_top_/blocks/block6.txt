Comment: 
This block of code implements a system reset logic for a certain component labelled as 'c3'. It particularly determines the value of the c3_sys_rst_i signal based on the state of the system reset. If the constant C3_RST_ACT_LOW is true, c3_sys_rst_i directly takes the value of the c3_sys_rst. Otherwise, the inverse of c3_sys_rst is used, as indicated by the bitwise NOT operation (~).
