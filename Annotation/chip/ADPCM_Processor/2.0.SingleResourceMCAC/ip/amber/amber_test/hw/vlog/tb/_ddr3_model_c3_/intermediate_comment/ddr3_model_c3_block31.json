    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a timing check associated with a negative edge of DQS (Data Queue Signals) for a specific memory operation. It does this by constantly monitoring the DQS signal (specifically, the second bit of the dqs_in array) for a negative edge. If such an edge is detected, the dqs_neg_timing_check function is called with the argument '1', following which the appropriate procedure(s) within that function are executed."
