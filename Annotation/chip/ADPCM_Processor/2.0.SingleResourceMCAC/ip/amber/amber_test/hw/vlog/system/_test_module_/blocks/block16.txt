Comment: 
This block of code is used to create a flip-flop that updates its value based on the `wb_start_read` signal. The operation of this block is dictated by the rising edge (`posedge`) of the `i_clk` signal. When a positive edge on `i_clk` is detected, the block assigns the present value of the `wb_start_read` to the `wb_start_read_d1`. This technique provides a one clock cycle delay to the `wb_start_read` signal, effectively synchronizing it with the clock signal `i_clk`. Such a setup is often used in digital systems to mitigate the risk of signal inconsistencies due to timing variations.
