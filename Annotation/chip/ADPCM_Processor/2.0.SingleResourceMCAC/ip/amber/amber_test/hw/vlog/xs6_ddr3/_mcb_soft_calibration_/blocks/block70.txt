The block controls the WAIT_SELFREFRESH_EXIT_DQS_CAL flag based on various conditions related to a memory's self-refresh mode. Upon receiving a rising edge of UI_CLK, if reset (RST) is active, the flag is reset. If the self-refresh mode is exiting (indicated by ~SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE_R3 and SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE_R2), the flag is set. If the flag is set, there is no self-refresh request, and dynamic calibration is to be performed after self-refresh, the flag is reset.
