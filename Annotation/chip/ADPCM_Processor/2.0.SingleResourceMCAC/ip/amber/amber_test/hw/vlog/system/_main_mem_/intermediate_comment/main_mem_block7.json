    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for initializing a 32-bit wide register named wb_rdata32. The implementation of the block simply assigns a digital value of 0 to wb_rdata32 using the verilog `'d0` notation. This is done under the scope identified as wb32. The block of code only executes if the preceding 'if' condition is false as it falls under the 'else' clause.\n"
