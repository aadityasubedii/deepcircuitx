It performs read and write operations, determined by the i_write_enable signal. The inputs to this module include i_clk for clock signal, i_write_data (a 32-bit signal representing data to be written), i_write_enable (signal indicating whether a write operation should occur), i_address (an 8-bit signal for addressing), and i_byte_enable (a 4-bit signal controlling byte-wise write). The only output port is o_read_data which is the 32-bit result of a read operation.\n\nInternally, the module uses 3-bit wide signals nc31, nc32, nc33, a 2-bit signal nc22 and a 4-bit signal wea. However, nc31, nc32, nc33, and nc22 seem to be unassigned. Wea signal determines the byte-wise write operation by ANDing it with 4 replicas of the write enable signal. The RAMB8BWER structure extends within the module, setting up data and address lines in SDP mode, enabling byte-wise write, and establishing the read output.\n\nThe module contains a structuring initial block where constraints for parameters DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH are executed and if not matched, corresponding warnings are displayed. This specification provides a thorough depiction of the xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en module regarding its functionality, implementation, and operation with an explicit mention of its ports and signals.",

The SRAM uses distributed RAM in SDP (Single Dual Port) mode provided by the `RAMB8BWER` core. It performs both read and write operations, with the operation determined by the `i_write_enable` signal. The SRAM accepts 32-bit data input and outputs 32-bit data, assigns addresses with an 8-bit address line, and uses the 4-bit `i_byte_enable` signal to enable writing to specific bytes. Data width and address width are parametrized, but it expects them to be 32 and 8 respectively, as set in the initial block."

When low, a read operation is intimated.\n4. i_address: This 8-bit wide signal determines the address to which the data is to be written or from which it is to be read.\n5. i_byte_enable: This 4-bit wide signal controls which bytes of the 32-bit write data should be written, each bit corresponds to each byte.\n\nOutput Ports:\n1. o_read_data: This is the 32-bit wide read data that comes out from the SRAM after a read operation.\n\nExplanation:\nThe inputs provide control and data lines to handle read/write operations in the SRAM. On each clock tick, based on the write enable signal, the module either writes the input data to the address specified (only to bytes where corresponding byte-enable bit is set) or reads data from the address specified into the o_read_data bus."
