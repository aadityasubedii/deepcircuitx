    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the signal 'pre_sysrst_minpulse_width_ok' with the 4th bit of the 'pre_sysrst_cnt' signal. The function of this particular block of code in Verilog is to set 'pre_sysrst_minpulse_width_ok' as a flag signal, indicating whether the count of 'pre_sysrst_cnt' has crossed a threshold (equivalent to 2^3 or 8 in binary count). This is achieved using bit-wise indexing on a binary encoded signal 'pre_sysrst_cnt' and only the 4th bit is extracted and assigned to 'pre_sysrst_minpulse_width_ok'."
