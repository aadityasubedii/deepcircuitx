    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is primarily used for state control assignment, specifically by mapping the control_state variable to the corresponding fairly descriptive state string. It uses a long chain of conditional (ternary) operator expressions to implement this conversion. Each possible control_state, each associated with different cycles or stages of the system operation, is checked in sequence, and upon a match, the respective descriptive string is assigned to xCONTROL_STATE. If none of the conditions is met, it defaults to assigning the string \"UNKNOWN\".\n"
