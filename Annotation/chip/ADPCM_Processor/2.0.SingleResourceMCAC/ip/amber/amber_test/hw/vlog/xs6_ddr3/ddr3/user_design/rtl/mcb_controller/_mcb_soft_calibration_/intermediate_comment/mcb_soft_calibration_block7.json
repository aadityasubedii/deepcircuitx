    "block_comment": "This block of code is implementing an edge-triggered flip-flop or a register with a reset functionality. During a positive edge of the 'UI_CLK' (user interface clock), if 'RST' (reset signal) is high, it makes the state of 'State_Start_DynCal_R1' as '0'. Otherwise, 'State_Start_DynCal_R1' holds the state of 'State_Start_DynCal'. The state transition is achieved through the 'always' statement that monitors the clock edge, combined with conditional statements that check the status of the reset signal."
