    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is intended to handle memory bursts of length 8, a common operation in memory interfaces. The block achieves its function by modifying the 'w1data' variable at different bit ranges, in steps of NUM_DQ_PINS. The modification process involves applying concatenation to portions of 'w1data' and assigning the result back to 'w1data', therefore reordering bits according to a specific pattern. Note that the delay of the assignments is time 'TCQ' which might be a predefined constant in the Verilog code referring to clock period or signal transition time."
