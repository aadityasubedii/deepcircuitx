    "block_comment": "This block defines a 36-bit wide dual-port RAM using the RAMB16BWER primitive with an initial reset state of zero. The parameters DATA_WIDTH_A and DATA_WIDTH_B specify the width of the data for each port. DOA_REG and DOB_REG parameters are set to 0, indicating that the output data from the RAM is not registered. The EN_RSTRAM_A and EN_RSTRAM_B parameters are set to \"FALSE\", meaning no synchronous RESET on the RAM arrays. The initial values of the memory are all set to zero by SRVAL_A, INITP_0 to INITP_07. However, after initialization, the RAM is filled with data from SRAM3_INIT_0 to SRAM3_INIT_61."
