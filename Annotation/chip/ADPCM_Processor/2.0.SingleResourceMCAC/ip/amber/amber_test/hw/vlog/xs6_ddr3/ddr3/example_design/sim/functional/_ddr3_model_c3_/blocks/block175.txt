The block of Verilog code is a system reset block for error checking. Its main function is to monitor the system reset signal and report an error when the pulse width violation occurs. The implementation relies on the built-in $time function in Verilog which returns the current simulation time and triggers an error message using $display function whenever the system reset condition violates the stated conditions. The reset condition corresponds to instances when 'tm_rst_n + 100000' is larger than the current 'time'. The block resumes its operation by storing the current time in 'tm_rst_n'.
