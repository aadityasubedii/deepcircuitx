Module name: xs6_sram_2048x32_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 2048x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA primitives. It consists of four 2048x8-bit SRAM blocks (RAMB16BWER) to create a 32-bit wide memory. The module supports byte-level write operations and can be initialized with predefined values using parameters. It has five input ports: i_clk (clock input), i_write_data (32-bit input data), i_write_enable (write enable signal), i_address (11-bit address input), and i_byte_enable (4-bit byte enable input). The output port is o_read_data (32-bit output data). Internally, it uses two signals: wea (4-
