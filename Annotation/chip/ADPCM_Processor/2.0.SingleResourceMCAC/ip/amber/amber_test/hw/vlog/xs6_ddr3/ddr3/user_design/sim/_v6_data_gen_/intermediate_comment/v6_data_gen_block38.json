    "block_comment": "The block is a data generation module for writing data in a memory system. Upon each clock cycle, the code checks if the system is ready or if a write command has started. If yes and sel_w1gen_logic is true, it generates data dependent on the input 'addr_i' (memory address). The data is generated by the 'Data_Gen' or `Data_GenW0` based on the 'data_mode_i'. The last part processes the generated w1data based on 'MEM_BURST_LEN', acting as a buffering system that organizes the data word size to fit memory."
