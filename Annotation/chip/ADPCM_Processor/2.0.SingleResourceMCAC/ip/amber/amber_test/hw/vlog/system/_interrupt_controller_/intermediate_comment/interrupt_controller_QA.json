It has capability to handle main interrupts (IRQs), fast interrupt requests (FIRQs) and also includes interfaces for communication with a Wishbone bus. The Wishbone bus interface allows it to access other peripherals or devices in the system. This module can enable, disable, set and clear individual interrupts. The module accepts interrupt inputs from two UART modules, an Ethernet MAC module, and three timer modules. Moreover, it uses software interrupt registers 'softint_0/1_reg' for more interrupt sources. Once interrupt requests are received, they are processed in function of their corresponding enable registers to determine the final interrupts. Finally, debugging information is generated when write/read operations are performed to/from the module's registers."
