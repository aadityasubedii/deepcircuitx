It utilizes four RAMB16BWER blocks to create a 128-bit wide memory with 512 addresses. The module supports byte-level write operations through a 16-bit byte enable signal, allowing selective writing to specific bytes within each 128-bit word. The memory is configurable with initial values for each SRAM block and provides both read and write capabilities."
