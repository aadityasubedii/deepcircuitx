    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for synchronizing the transmit retry signal (TxRetry) with the WriteBack clock (WB_CLK_I).  Upon the rising edge of WB_CLK_I or when the system reset signal is high, if the reset signal is high, it forcefully sets the TxRetrySync1 to zero. If not, it takes the existing TxRetry value. This could be a part of a serial data communication module where error handling is implemented."
