    "block_comment": "This block synchronizes the AXI interface of a memory controller block (MCB) to the user interface (UI) parameters. It assigns user interface parameters and address values while masking the address with the S5_AXI_ADDRMASK for the AXI read and write address assignments. Two modules are instantiated, one for synchronization (axi_mcb_synch) and the other for the AXI MCB interface (axi_mcb). The synchronization block receives an input 'uo_done_cal' and produces a synchronized output 'calib_done_synch'. The axi_mcb module is parameterized with settings for AXI ID, ADDR, DATA widths along with read, write supports and others. All the relevant AXI signals, MCB read/write commands, data signals, errors, and also the calibration signals are interfaced to this module."
