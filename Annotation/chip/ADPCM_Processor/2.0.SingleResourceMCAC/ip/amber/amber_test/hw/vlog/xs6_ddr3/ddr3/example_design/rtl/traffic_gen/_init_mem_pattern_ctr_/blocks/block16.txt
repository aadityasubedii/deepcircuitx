This block of code is used to identify when the current address surpasses a specified end boundary in a clock cycle interface system. It checks whether the lowest byte (8 bits) of the current address (`current_address[7:0]`) is greater than or equal to the end boundary address (`end_boundary_addr[7:0]`). If the current address does exceed or equal the end boundary, the `lower_end_matched` flag is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. This block of code is mainly used for memory address bounds checking.
