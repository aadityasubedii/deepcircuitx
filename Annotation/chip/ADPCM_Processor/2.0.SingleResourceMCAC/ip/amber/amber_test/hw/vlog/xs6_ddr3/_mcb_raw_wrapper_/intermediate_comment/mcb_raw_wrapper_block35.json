    "block_comment": "This block of code is a finite state machine for clock training in Verilog hardware description language. It primarily defines the behavior of the `cke_train` register using `ui_clk` (user interface clock) and `int_sys_rst` (system reset) signals as well as the states of `wait_200us_done_r1`, `wait_200us_done_r2`, and `uo_done_cal` flags. The block is initiated by either the rising edge of `ui_clk` or `int_sys_rst`. If the system resets, it de-asserts `cke_train_reg`. If not, the `cke_train_reg` is set to 1 when the waiting period of 200 \u00b5s is over, and it continues until the operation is done. Finally, `cke_train_reg` is assigned to `cke_train`, which can be used elsewhere in the overall design."
