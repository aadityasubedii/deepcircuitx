Comment: 
This block of Verilog code uses conditional generation to create hardware based on the value of `PRBS_CMD`. If `PRBS_CMD` matches either "INSTR" or "BLEN", a new always block named `gen20_taps` is generated, which is clocked on the rising edge of the signal `clk_i`. This structure allows dynamic hardware generation based on the predetermined conditions, ensuring proper functioning under varying requirements. The always block `gen20_taps` will execute its contents on every positive clock edge when the `PRBS_CMD` condition is satisfied.
