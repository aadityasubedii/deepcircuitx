Comment: 
The code block handles the assignment of the 'shift_amount' variable and the modification of a value retrieved from the register based on the 'shift_amount'. In more detail, the 'shift_amount' is either assigned the negation of the lower 24 bits of 'execute_instruction' plus 1 (if the 24th bit of 'execute_instruction' is high) or the lower 24 bits of 'execute_instruction' itself (if the 24th bit is low). If the 24th bit is high, the function 'fwrite_hex_drop_zeros' is called with two arguments: a file to write to and the difference between 'get_reg_val' of 21 and 'shift_amount'. If the 24th bit is low, 'fwrite_hex_drop_zeros' is called with the sum of 'get_reg_val' of 21 and 'shift_amount'.
