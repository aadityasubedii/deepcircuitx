This block of code is responsible for synchronizing the 'ReadTxDataFromFifo' signal with the write-back clock 'WB_CLK_I'. It does so by registering 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync2' to 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync3' on the rising edge of 'WB_CLK_I' or 'Reset'. 'Reset' basically resets 'ReadTxDataFromFifo_sync3' to its initial state, which is logic low or '0'.
