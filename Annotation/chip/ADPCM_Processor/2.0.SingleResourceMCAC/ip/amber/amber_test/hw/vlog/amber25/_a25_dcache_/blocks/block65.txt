This Verilog block controls cache operation states, primarily initiating the cache, delegating resources, writing and reading hits, and managing write misses. It responds to reset and clock signals, and iterates through various states (CS_INIT, CS_IDLE, CS_FILL, etc.) setting conditions for the next state and adjusting control signals (like select_way, source_sel, random_num) based on the current state. Each sub-block addresses a specific state's functions and corresponding conditions. Resets initialize default values. CS_INIT initializes cache lines. States like CS_IDLE handle read, write hits and misses. CS_TURN_AROUND makes temporal transition states while states like CS_WRITE_HIT_WAIT_WB manage write buffer readiness. The block also performs debugging displaying specific messages in corresponding states.
