This block of Verilog code controls the transmission of frames in a network. It does this through an always block that is executed at every positive edge of the MTxClk or TxReset signals. Initially, TxCtrlStartFrm is set to 0 when reset happens. The block also enables TxCtrlStartFrm when there is no ongoing data transmission (TxUsedDataOut is low) and a control frame is ready to be sent (flagged by WillSendControlFrame). When CtrlMux and TxUsedDataIn_q are both high, the transmission gets paused by setting TxCtrlStartFrm to 0. The condition to send the control frame is enhanced by checking if there are no outstanding operations (like TxDoneIn, TxAbortIn, or TxStartFrmIn) or if TxUsedDataOutDetected is low.
