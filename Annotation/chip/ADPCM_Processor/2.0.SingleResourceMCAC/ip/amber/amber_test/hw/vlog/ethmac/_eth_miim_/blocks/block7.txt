Comment: 
This block serves as a bit counter that is enabled and controlled by a few conditions. When a positive edge triggers on either the Clk or Reset signals, the block is activated. If Reset is active, the BitCounter is set to zero, but if not, it checks if MdcEn is active. If MdcEn is enabled, and InProgress is also true, BitCounter is either incremented by one, (if NoPre & its current value is not zero) or set to '21' (if NoPre & its current value equals zero). If InProgress is false, BitCounter is reset to zero. The operations have a time delay of #Tp to ensure synchronization.
