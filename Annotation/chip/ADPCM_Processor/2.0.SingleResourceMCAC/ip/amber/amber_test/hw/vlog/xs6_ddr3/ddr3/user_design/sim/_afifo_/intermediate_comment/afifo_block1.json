    "block_comment": "This block of code acts as a status flag generator for a FIFO buffer, setting an `almost_full` flag. A high level output flag, `almost_full`, is set in the case when the FIFO buffer is almost full. This is denoted by the condition `(buf_avail == FIFO_DEPTH - 2)` which checks if the buffer availability is just two less than the maximum depth. An additional condition `(buf_avail == FIFO_DEPTH -3) && wr_en` checks if the buffer availability is three less than the maximum depth and a write operation is enabled. In the case when a reset condition `rst` is true, the `almost_full` flag is set back to zero, thus resetting it."
