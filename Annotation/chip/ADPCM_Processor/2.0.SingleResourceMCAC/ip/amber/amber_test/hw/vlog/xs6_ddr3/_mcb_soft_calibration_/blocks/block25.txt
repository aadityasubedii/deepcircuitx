This block of code is essentially a state machine in the Finite State Machine (FSM) model, specifically involved in the UDQS_PIN_P_TERM_WAIT state. It establishes the condition and resultant state change. If the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N flag is not set, the state remains as UDQS_PIN_P_TERM_WAIT, otherwise, it switches to the UDQS_PIN_WRITE_N_TERM state. Such a design allows the FSM to wait till MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is set, or proceed if it's already set, regulating the state transitions.
