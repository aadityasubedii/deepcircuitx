    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code declares a wire `rx_bit_start` that indicates the start of receiving a bit in serial data transmission. This is achieved by checking if the `rx_bit_count` is equal to zero. When this condition is true, `rx_bit_start` assumestrue, otherwise it remains false. Therefore this block serves as a trigger point for starting the bit reception in the data transfer process."
