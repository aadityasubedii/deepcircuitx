    "block_comment": "The block of code combines several status bits and flags into two separate 32-bit registers, namely r15_out_rm and r15_out_rm_nxt, and also prepares a specific format of the r15 register into r15_out_rn. The r15_out_rm output register is formed by concatenating various status bit flags, irq mask, firq mask, the r15 register itself, and the current execution mode. Similarly, the r15_out_rm_nxt output register is created, but the r15 register is replaced with the current instruction counter (i_pc). Additionally, r15_out_rn is prepared by concatenating a 6-bit zero, the r15 register, and 2 zeros."
