    "block_comment": "The block primarily handles the interruption flow of a system/runtime during either a reset or normal execution. Whenever there's a reset, 'interrupt_d1' is set to zero. However, if there's no 'core_stall' in the system and an interruption occurs, this block identifies the interruption type and writes it alongside the return address into a 'decompile_file'. The type of interruption is determined based on a predefined value of 'interrupt_d1', realized through the case construct, while the return address is fetched using the function 'get_reg_val' for different registers depending on the 'interrupt_d1' value."
