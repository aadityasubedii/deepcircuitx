    "block_comment": "This Verilog block assigns the `IncrementByteCnt` signal based on the current state and other conditions. The logic primarily uses bitwise operations (`&`, `|`) and the unary reduction AND (`&`). During the `StateData[1]` and not `ByteCntMax`, or the `StateBackOff` and a reduction AND on the lower 7 bits of `NibCnt`, or (either `StatePAD` or `StateFCS` state) and `NibCnt[0]` and not `ByteCntMax`, the `IncrementByteCnt` is activated."
