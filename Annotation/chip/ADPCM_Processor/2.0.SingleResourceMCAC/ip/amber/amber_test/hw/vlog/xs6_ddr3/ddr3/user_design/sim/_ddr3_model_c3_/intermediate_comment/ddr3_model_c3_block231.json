    "block_comment": "This block carries out an initial setup for a simulation. It features parameter checks, time formatting, and a counter initialization. If the received BL_MAX parameter is less than 2 or the value of 2^BO_BITS exceeds the BL_MAX parameter, it displays an error message. Additionally, it sets the time format to picoseconds. To enable randomness in subsequent operations, it assigns an initial provided seed value to a variable named 'seed'. This block also resets the clock counter 'ck_cntr' to zero."
