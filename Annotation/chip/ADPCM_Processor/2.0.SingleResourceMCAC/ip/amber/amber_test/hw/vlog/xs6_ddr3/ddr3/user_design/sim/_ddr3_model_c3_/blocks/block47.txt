This block sets up a timing-check function for a negative edge-triggered event. Specifically, it implements a timing check for the 19th bit of the dqs_in digital input signal array whenever there is a falling edge (or 'negative edge' in hardware terms). The function 'dqs_pos_timing_check' is called every time a negedge is detected on the 19th bit of dqs_in.
