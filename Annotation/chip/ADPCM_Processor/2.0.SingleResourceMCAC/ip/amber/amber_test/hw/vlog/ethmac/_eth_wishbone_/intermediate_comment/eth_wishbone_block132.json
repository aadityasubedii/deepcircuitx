    "block_comment": "This block latches the Transmit Length based on specific conditional signals. When the system resets or on the positive edge of WB_CLK_I, the Tx Length is set to 0. Under normal circumstances, if both Transmit Enable (TxEn) and its previous state (TxEn_q) are enabled, and Transmit Buffer Descriptor is being read (TxBDRead), the Tx Length will be latched from the higher 16 bits of the data output from the RAM."
