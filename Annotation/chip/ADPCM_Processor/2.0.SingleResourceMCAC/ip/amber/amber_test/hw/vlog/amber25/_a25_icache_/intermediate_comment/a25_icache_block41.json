    "block_comment": "The block of code facilitates data transfer within the write buffer(WB). This block of code utilizes a conditional assignment operation to establish whether a hit occurs in WB, identified by `wb_hit`. The condition takes into account the present state of the write buffer, represented by `wb_address`, the incoming address `i_address`, the write buffer readiness `i_wb_ready` and the state of WB fill (`fill_state`). When these conditions are equivalent and true, `wb_hit` is set to true, signifying successful data transmission."
