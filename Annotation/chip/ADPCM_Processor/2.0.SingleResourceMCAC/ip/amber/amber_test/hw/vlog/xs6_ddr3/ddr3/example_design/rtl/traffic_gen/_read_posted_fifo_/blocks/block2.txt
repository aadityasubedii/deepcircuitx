This block of code generates a signal (gen_valid_o) that indicates the "validity" status of a certain unit, module, or data structure (which isn't implicitly stated in the snippet). It does so by taking the negation of a signal or variable "empty" using the "assign" keyword, which means that the signal gen_valid_o is high or '1' when the monitored unit is not empty, and low or '0' if the unit is empty.
