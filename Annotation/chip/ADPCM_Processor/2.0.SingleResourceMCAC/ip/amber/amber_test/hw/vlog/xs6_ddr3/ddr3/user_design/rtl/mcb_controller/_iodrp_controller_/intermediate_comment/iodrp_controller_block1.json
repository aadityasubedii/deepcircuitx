    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a synchronous state machine in Verilog. The state machine advances on the rising edge of the DRP_CLK signal. If a synchronous reset (sync_rst) occurs, the state machine transitions to the READY state. If a reset does not occur, the state machine transitions to the state indicated by \"nextstate\". Notably, this block employs synchronous reset instead of asynchronous reset to ensure clock domain integrity and to simplify timing analysis constraints."
