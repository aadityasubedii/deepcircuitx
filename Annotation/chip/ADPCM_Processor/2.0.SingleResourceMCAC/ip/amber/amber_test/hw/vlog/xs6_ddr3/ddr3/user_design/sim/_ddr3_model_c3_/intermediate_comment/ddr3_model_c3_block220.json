    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a memory read operation in a digital system. Depending on the defined condition (MAX_MEM), it uses different methods of addressing to retrieve the data. If MAX_MEM is defined, the address is calculated using the row and column inputs divided by the maximum memory block size, and the data is then read from the specified file at that address. Conversely, if MAX_MEM is not defined, the address is defined by the bank, row, and column inputs divided by maximum memory block size. The data is then either fetched from the memory if the address is present in the index or an unknown value is returned."
