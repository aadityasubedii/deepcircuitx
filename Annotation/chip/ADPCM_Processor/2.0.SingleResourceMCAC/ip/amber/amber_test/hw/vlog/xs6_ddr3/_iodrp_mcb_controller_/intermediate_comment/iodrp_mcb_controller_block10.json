    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for selecting and outputting data. Depending on the addr_data_sel_n flag, it performs a conditional assign operation. If the flag is true, it assigns the value of memcell_addr_reg, appended with a preceding '0', to the output 'data_out'. If the flag is false, it assigns the value of data_reg, also appended with a leading '0', to 'data_out'. The purpose of appending with '0' is to maintain synchronism in data size."
