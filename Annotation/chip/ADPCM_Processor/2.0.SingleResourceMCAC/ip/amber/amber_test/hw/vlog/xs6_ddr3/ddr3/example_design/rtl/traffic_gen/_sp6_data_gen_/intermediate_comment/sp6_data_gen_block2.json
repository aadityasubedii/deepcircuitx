    "block_comment": "This block of RTL Verilog code controls the increment of the 'adata' register based on different conditions. At each rising edge of the clock ('clk_i'), if 'cmd_startD' is true, it sets the 'adata' to the input address ('addr_i') after a delay defined by 'TCQ'. If 'cmd_startD' is not true but 'fifo_rdy_i' and 'data_rdy_i' are true and 'user_burst_cnt' is greater than 1, it increments 'adata' by a certain value. The increment value depends on the 'DWIDTH' which can be either 128, 64 or other, corresponding to increment by 16, 8 or 4 respectively, each with a delay defined by 'TCQ'.\n"
