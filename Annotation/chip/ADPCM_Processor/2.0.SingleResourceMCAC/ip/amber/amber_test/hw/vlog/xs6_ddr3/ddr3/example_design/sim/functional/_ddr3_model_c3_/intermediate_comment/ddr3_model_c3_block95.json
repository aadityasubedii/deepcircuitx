    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for monitoring the 36th bit of the `dq_in` signal (Verilog indexing starts from 0). The block achieves this function by using the `always` keyword to watch for any changes to `dq_in[35]`. Whenever a change is detected in the 36th bit of `dq_in`, a function named `dq_timing_check(35)` is called. This function presumably checks some timing parameters related to `dq_in[35]` within the wider system."
