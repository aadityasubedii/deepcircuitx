    "block_comment": "The code block is designed to manage buffering capabilities by checking if the buffer, represented by dfifo, has sufficient space. On every positive edge of the input clock (clk_i), it updates the status of two signals: dfifo_has_enough_room and dfifo_has_enough_room_d1. The signal dfifo_has_enough_room assesses if the buffer available, indicated by buf_avail_r, is greater than or equal to 62. It will be set to 1 if true, and 0 if false. The updated state of dfifo_has_enough_room is then used to update the state of dfifo_has_enough_room_d1 in the next clock cycle."
