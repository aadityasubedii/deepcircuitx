    "block_comment": "This block is a hardware description for managing the status signals for data transmission in a Write Back (WB) system. It operates based on the positive edges of the WB_CLK_I clock signal or a system Reset. In the event of a Reset, or if both TxDone_wb and TxAbort_wb signals are de-asserted(~), the BlockingTxStatusWrite is de-asserted(reset to 0) presumably to stop any transmission undergoing. However, if TxStatusWrite is asserted(high), the BlockingTxStatusWrite is asserted to enable transmission. Importantly, each operation happens after some propagation delay denoted by <=#Tp, which is a useful feature to ensure proper sequencing and synchronization."
