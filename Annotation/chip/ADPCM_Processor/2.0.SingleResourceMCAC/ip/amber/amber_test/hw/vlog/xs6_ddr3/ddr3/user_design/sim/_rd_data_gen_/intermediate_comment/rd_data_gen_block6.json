    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `cmd_rdy` to the output `cmd_rdy_o`. The `assign` statement in Verilog allows continuous assignment of a value to a wire. The right hand-side expression `cmd_rdy` is continuously evaluated and its latest value is assigned to `cmd_rdy_o` whenever it changes."
