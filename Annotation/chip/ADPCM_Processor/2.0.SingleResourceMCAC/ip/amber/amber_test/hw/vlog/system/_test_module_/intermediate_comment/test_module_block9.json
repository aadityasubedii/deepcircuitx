    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for managing the operations of a timer interrupt in a system. The timer's value is updated based on conditions triggered by a write bus (wb), where a \u2018wb_start_write\u2019 condition signals the bus to start writing and the address of the write bus (i_wb_adr) matches the address of this IRQ timer (AMBER_TEST_IRQ_TIMER). In this case, the timer is updated to the least significant byte of the data from the write bus(wb_wdata32). On the other hand, if the timer value is more significant than 1, it is decremented by 1 in each clock cycle."
