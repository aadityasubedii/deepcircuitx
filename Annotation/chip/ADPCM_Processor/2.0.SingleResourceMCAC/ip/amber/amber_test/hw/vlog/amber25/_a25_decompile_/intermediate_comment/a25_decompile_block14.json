    "block_comment": "The function of this block is a task called 'swap_args' that decompiles the values of three registers (reg_d, reg_m, reg_n) and writes them into a file, formatting the output in a specific way. This task first warms up reg_d and writes it to a file followed by a comma. Then, it does the same for reg_m. Afterwards, it warms up reg_n, encloses its value in square brackets and writes it to the file as well. Therefore, this task is implemented by warming up each register and using $fwrite to write the values into the file with proper formatting."
