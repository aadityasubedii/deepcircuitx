    "block_comment": "This block of code is a data generator in a Verilog design that creates different data sequences based on different conditions. It operates on the rising edge of the clock signal and creates a new data sequence when FIFO is ready or when the start command is received. If the block 'sel_w1gen_logic' is enabled, it uses a combination of 'addr_i' and 'data_mode_i' inputs to determine which data sequence 'Data_Gen' or 'Data_GenW0' to use. The 'addr_i' value helps to select a specific pattern for data generation while 'data_mode_i' determines if a standard or a specific (represented by 4'b0101) data mode must be used. If 'MEM_BURST_LEN' equals 8, a certain operation is executed to modify the 'w1data' content by shifting and combining bits from its own previous value."
