This block of code is used to generate a pulse when the run_traffic_i signal is asserted (goes from 0 to 1). It achieves this function by using a register (run_traffic_r) to store the previous state of run_traffic_i. When the current state of run_traffic_i is HIGH and the previous state (run_traffic_r) is LOW, this signifies the rising edge of run_traffic_i signal. At this moment, the code sets run_traffic_pulse at 1 until the next rising edge of the clock. Otherwise, run_traffic_pulse is reset to 0.
