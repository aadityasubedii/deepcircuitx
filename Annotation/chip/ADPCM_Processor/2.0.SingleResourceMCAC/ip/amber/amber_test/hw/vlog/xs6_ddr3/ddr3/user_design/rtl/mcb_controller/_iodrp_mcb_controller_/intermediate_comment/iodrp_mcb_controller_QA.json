The primary function is to manage read and write operations through Verilog modules, flip-flops series, and shifting sequences for the DRP. It does memory cell address storage, write data storage, a shifting process via shifting tasks, and manages DRP commands and broadcast usage. The controller also manages addressing and data phases with a finite state machine and provides functionality for modifying the data output depending on the DRP IOI address. The state of the module, defined by several local parameters, is utilized in a state machine for well-controlled read and write formats."
