    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns values to the `r_RGAD` and `r_FIAD` registers from specific slices of the `MIIADDRESSOut` register. The 5-bit slices spanning the 8th to 12th bit and the 0th to 4th bit of `MIIADDRESSOut` are assigned to `r_RGAD` and `r_FIAD`, respectively, using `assign` statements in Verilog."
