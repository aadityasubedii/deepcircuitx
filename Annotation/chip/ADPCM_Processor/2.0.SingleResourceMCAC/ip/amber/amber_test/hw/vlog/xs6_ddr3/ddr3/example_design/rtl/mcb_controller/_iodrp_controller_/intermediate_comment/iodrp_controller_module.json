    "module": "Module-level comment: The iodrp_controller module controls a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP), managing read/write operations, and supporting a broadcasting feature. The module utilizes input ports to receive data and commands; generates output controls, addresses, and read data; and employs internal signals for data management and flow control. It operates via a finite-state machine (FSM) which orchestrates all operations - address state to data transition, handling the gapped state, data state, resetting operation, etc. providing efficient operation of the DRP."
