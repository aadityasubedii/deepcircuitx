Comment: 
The block of code governs the updating mechanism for the signal 'RxEnSync'. It essentially synchronizes the receiver enable signal 'RxEnSync' with the rising edge of the master clock 'mrx_clk_pad_i' or the write-back reset signal 'wb_rst_i'. If the write-back reset signal 'wb_rst_i' is active (high), 'RxEnSync' is reset. If it is inactive (low) and at low drive strength 'mrxdv_pad_i', 'RxEnSync' mirrors the state of 'r_RxEn', after a propagation delay '#Tp'. The '#Tp' delay imitates the propagation time through the electronic circuitry.
