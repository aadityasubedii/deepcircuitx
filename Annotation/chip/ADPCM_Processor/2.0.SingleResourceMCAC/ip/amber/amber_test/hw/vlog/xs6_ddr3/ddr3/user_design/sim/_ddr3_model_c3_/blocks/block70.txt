[Function of the block] This block of code in Verilog is functioned to perform a timing check on data queue input element index 60, anytime there is a change in that specific index. [Implementation details of the block] The implementation was done by invoking the function dq_timing_check with parameter 60, in an 'always' block which will continually monitor for any changes made to dq_in[60], subsequently triggering the function for validation check.
