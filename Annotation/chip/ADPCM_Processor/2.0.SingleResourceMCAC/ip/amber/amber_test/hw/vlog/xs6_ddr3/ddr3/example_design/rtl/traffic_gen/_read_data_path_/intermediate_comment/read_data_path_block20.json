    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to assign two signals: `data_rdy_o` and `data_rdy`. `data_rdy_o` serves as the outward indication of data readiness, which mirrors the state of `data_rdy`. `data_rdy`, on the other hand, is a logical AND product of two input signals: `cmp_valid` and `data_valid_i`. Essentially, `data_rdy` is set when both the comparative operation is valid (`cmp_valid`) and the input data is valid (`data_valid_i`). Only when these conditions are met, `data_rdy_o` is also set to indicate data readiness."
