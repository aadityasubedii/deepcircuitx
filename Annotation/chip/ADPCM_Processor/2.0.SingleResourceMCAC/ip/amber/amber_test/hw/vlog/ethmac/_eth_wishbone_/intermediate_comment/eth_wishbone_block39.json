    "block_comment": "The block assigns a Boolean value to `WriteRxDataToFifo_wb` based on the bitwise AND operation involving `WriteRxDataToFifoSync2` and the negation of `WriteRxDataToFifoSync3`. The implementation logic is essentially a two-input AND gate with the second input being inverted. The block signals whether or not to write received data to the FIFO buffer. This is determined based on the asserted signal `WriteRxDataToFifoSync2` (data ready) and the negation of `WriteRxDataToFifoSync3` (buffer not full)."
