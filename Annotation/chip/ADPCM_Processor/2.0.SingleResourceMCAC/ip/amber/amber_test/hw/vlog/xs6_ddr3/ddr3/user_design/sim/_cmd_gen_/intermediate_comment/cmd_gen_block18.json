    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is an Edge Detector module. It identifies when a 'x' input signal transitions from a low state to a high state, thereby detecting the rising edge of the signal. Internally, it uses a delay element, which passes the input signal 'x' after one clock cycle delay and a comparator, which checks the difference between the delayed and non-delayed inputs to identify a rising edge event. When this occurs, the output 'y' is high for one clock cycle and low otherwise."
