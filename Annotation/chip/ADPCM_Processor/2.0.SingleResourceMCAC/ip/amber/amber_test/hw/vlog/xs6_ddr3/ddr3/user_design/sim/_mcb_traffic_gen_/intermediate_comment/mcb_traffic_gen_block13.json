    "block_comment": "This block is a module instantiation of 'mcb_control' that is responsible for managing the memory controller commands, read and write operations. It takes as inputs clock, reset signal, command and address from the flow controller, the byte length of data to be transferred, and signalling flags indicating if it's the last word for read or write. Also, it provides output flags indicating the readiness for command, read, and write operations, the processed command, address, byte length, and separate flags for validity of each operation. Implementing the command, read, and write operation logic, it reflects a central management unit in the memory controller context hence interfacing between the memory controller and the data flow."
