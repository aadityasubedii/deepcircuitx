I'm afraid your request is not feasible with the current information provided. The provided Verilog code only contains a timescale directive:

```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
```

This is not directly related to any specific module; it sets the time unit and precision for the simulation.

In order to provide a detailed specification of a module as per your request, a complete Verilog module definition is required. This definition should include the module name, its I/O ports, its internal signals, and the different blocks of logic inside the module.

A complete Verilog module definition should be similar to this:

```verilog
module module_name(input a, b, output y);
  // internal signals defined here
  // different blocks of logic here
endmodule
```

After receiving a complete Verilog code, I could generate a specification that includes module name, explanation, I/O ports, internal signals and different blocks and their functions. Until then, I'm unable to provide the information you're asking for.
