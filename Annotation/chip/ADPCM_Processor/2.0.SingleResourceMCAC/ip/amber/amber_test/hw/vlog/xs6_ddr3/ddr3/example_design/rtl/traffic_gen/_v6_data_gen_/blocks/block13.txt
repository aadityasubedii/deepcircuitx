This block of code generates a data word based on the input address and the data mode. The block prepares on every rising edge of the clock and checks if fifo is ready or a start command is received. If true, it checks the incoming address and accordingly assigns data from the respective data generator function. There are two functions Data_Gen and Data_GenW0 respectively used for data_mode_i equals to 4'b0101 or not. The output is synchronous to the clock and comes with a delay defined by TCQ. If an address doesn't match any predefined case, the data is set to 0.
