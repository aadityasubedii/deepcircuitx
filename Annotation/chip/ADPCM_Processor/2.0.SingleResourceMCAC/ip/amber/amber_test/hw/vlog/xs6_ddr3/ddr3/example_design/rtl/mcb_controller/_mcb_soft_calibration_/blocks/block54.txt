Comment: 
This block of code is dedicated to loading the non-termination impedance of the DRAM by setting appropriate control signals for the I/O data retention power conservation register (IODRPCTRLR). It works by assigning 'RZQ' to 'Active_IODRP', setting the 'CMD_VALID' signal to HIGH, passing 'NTerm' memory cell address to 'MEMCELL_ADDR', writing the non-termination value 'N_Term' to 'WRITE_DATA', and finally setting the 'R_WB' signal to 'WRITE_MODE'. Depending on the readiness state of 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N', it either loops back to 'LOAD_RZQ_NTERM' state or proceeds to 'WAIT1' state.
