This module generates a sequence of pseudorandom binary numbers. This PRBS generator is parameterized by the width of the PRBS as given by PRBS_WIDTH and the seed width as SEED_WIDTH. It uses a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) for generating the pseudorandom sequence. The operation of the LFSR can be initiated or reset through 'prbs_seed_init' and 'rst_i' input signals. If the 'prbs_seed_init' signal is high and the EYE_TEST is set to \"FALSE\", or if 'rst_i' input is high the module will initialize (or reset) the LFSR to the sum of 'prbs_seed_i', 'prbs_fseed_i' and a specific constant. If the clock enable signal 'clk_en' is high, the module updates the LFSR based on a certain logic and the output prbs_o reflects the states of the LFSR. The sequence generated by this PRBS can be used for various purposes like in testing and debugging."
