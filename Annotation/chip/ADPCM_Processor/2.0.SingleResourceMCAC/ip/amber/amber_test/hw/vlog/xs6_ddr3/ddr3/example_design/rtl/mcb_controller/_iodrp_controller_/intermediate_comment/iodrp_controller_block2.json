    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code describes a finite state machine (FSM) used for command processing. It transitions through different states including READY, DECIDE, ADDR_PHASE, ADDR_TO_DATA_GAP, DATA_PHASE, and ALMOST_READY based on the inputs like cmd_valid, rd_not_write_reg, and AddressPhase. It governs transitions by checking conditions and updating state variables such as 'nextstate' that drives FSM, and control signals like 'load_shift_n' and 'addr_data_sel_n'. At each cycle, depending on the current state and input conditions, it decides the value of control signals and the next state of FSM."
