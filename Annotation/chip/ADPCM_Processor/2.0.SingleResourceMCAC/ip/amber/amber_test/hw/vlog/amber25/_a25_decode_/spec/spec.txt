Module name: a25_decode. Module specification: This module is responsible for decoding ARM instructions in an A25 processor core. It takes various input signals, including clock, reset, fetch instruction, core stall, interrupt requests, and status bits. The module outputs control signals for the execution stage, including register selection, ALU operation, memory access, and status bit updates. Internally, it uses numerous signals to manage instruction decoding, pipeline control, and interrupt handling. The module is structured into several main blocks, including instruction decoding logic, control state machine, condition checking, and various execution modes (e.g., memory transfers, multiply operations, coprocessor operations). It handles different instruction types, manages interrupts, and generates control signals for various functional units like the ALU, barrel shifter, and register bank. The module also implements the instruction pipeline, handles pipeline stalls and conflicts, and manages the processor's overall control flow. It includes debug functionality
