    "block_comment": "The code block handles a busy or stall signal of a cache system. The busy/stall signal is active when the cache is in a TURN_AROUND or FILL1 state and the enable signal is high, or when the cache is in its INIT state, as controlled by the status of the c_state and enable signals."
