    "block_comment": "The function \"pick_way\" is configured to select a particular 'way' based upon the contents of valid_bits and a random number. Initially, the function evaluates the \"valid_bits\" input. If it's first or second bit equals '0', the function assigns corresponding values ('01' and '10') to the \"pick_way\". However, if neither condition is fulfilled, the function moves onto the \"case\" statement associated with a randomly generated number. Based on certain specific values ('0', '3', '5', '6'), \"pick_way\" is assigned '10'. For all other cases, it's made '01'."
