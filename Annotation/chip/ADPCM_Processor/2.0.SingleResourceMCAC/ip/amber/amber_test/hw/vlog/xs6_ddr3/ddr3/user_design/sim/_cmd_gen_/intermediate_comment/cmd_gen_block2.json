    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a PRBS (Pseudorandom Binary Sequence) generator based on certain command patterns. If the command pattern is either \"CGEN_PRBS\" or \"CGEN_ALL\", the PRBS generator is initiated with specified parameters. These parameters include time clock quantum (TCQ), family, command pattern, address width, seed width, and PRBS width which are assigned using the `cmd_prbs_gen` module. The PRBS generator is then synchronized to an input clock (`clk_i`) and enabled with a `cmd_clk_en` signal. A seed initiation (`load_seed_i`) and seed input (`cmd_seed_i[16:2]`) are also required for the generator which output the `prbs_bl`, the pseudorandom binary sequence."
