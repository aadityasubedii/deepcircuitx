    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for handling a timeout situation. On each positive edge of the system clock (`U_SYSTEM.sys_clk`), it checks if the timeout variable is not zero. If it's not zero, it further checks if the clock count (`U_TB.clk_count`) is greater than or equal to the timeout value. If these conditions are met, a timeout error message will be displayed. This error message provides instructions to the user about how to adjust the timeout value by editing a file (`$AMBER_BASE/hw/tests/timeouts.txt`)."
