    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a hardware design for resetting and assembling a timer value. On the positive edge-triggered clock (MRxClk) or the reset signal (RxReset), the 16-bit timer value (AssembledTimerValue) is set to zero. If RxStartFrm is enabled, the timer value is also reset. But when ByteCntEq16 or ByteCntEq17 are true within the DetectionWindow, provided RxStartFrm is not enabled and there's no reset signal, the upper and lower bytes of AssembledTimerValue are updated with the incoming data, RxData[7:0], respectively."
