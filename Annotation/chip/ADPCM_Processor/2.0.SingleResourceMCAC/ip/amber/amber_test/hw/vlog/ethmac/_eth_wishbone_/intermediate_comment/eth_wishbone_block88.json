    "block_comment": "This block of code manages packet transmission status in a Write Back (WB) cache system. Upon a rising edge of the WB clock or a high reset signal, the code evaluates several conditions to set the value of the 'TxDonePacket_NotCleared' flag. Initially, upon reset, the flag is cleared. If the transmitter is enabled both currently and in the previous state, and the packet has not been cleared, the flag is cleared again. If the packet transmission has finished with certain conditions (e.g. no current transmission burst, master WB transmission, master access finished, and packet not being blocked), or the packet transmission has finished but without master WB transmission and not blocked, the flag is set. This helps manage and control packet transmission in the system accurately."
