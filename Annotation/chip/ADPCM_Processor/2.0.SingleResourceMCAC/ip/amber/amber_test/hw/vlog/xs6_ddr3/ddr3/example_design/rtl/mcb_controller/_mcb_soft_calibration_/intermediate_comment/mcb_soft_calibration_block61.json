    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to set the Increment Flag (Inc_Flag) based on the comparison between TARGET_DQS_DELAY and DQS_DELAY. If the TARGET_DQS_DELAY is larger than DQS_DELAY, the flag is set to 1, otherwise, it remains 0. It's a simple comparison operation implemented using the assign statement in Verilog, which sets the value of Inc_Flag immediately once the right-side Boolean condition is calculated."
