    "block_comment": "This block of code generates output buffers (OBUFTs) for memory addresses in a memory controller block for DRAM (mcbx_dram_addr). Using a for-loop in the generate statement, it dynamically creates one OBUFT for each bit of the address line based on the width defined by C_MEM_ADDR_WIDTH. Each OBUFT takes one bit of the input logic vector (ioi_addr) and the tri-state control (t_addr) as inputs and connects them to corresponding bit position in the DRAM address (mcbx_dram_addr)."
