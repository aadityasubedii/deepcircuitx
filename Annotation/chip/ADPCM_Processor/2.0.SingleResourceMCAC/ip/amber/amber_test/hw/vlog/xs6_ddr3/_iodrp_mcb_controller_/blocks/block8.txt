Comment: 
This block of code pertains to a counter in a finite state machine, which increments the `bit_cnt` variable synchronously with rising edge of `DRP_CLK`. If the machine's current state is either `ADDR_PHASE` or `DATA_PHASE` and `sync_rst` is not active, `bit_cnt` is incremented. However, in all other states or if `sync_rst` is active, `bit_cnt` is reset to zero.
