This block of code is responsible for controlling a shift operation within a hardware design. It utilizes a series of conditional checks to determine when the shift operation should be ended. On every positive edge of the Master Receive Clock (MRxClk) or reset, the shift operation is checked. If the system is reset, the shift operation is abruptly ended. If the shift operation itself has ended (ShiftEnded_rck) or has been aborted (RxAbort), then the shift operation is ended as well. If the shift operation is set to start (StartShiftWillEnd), then it commences. The actual terminating or commencing of the shift operation is controlled by the ShiftWillEnd variable.
