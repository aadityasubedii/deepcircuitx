This block manages the request for self-refresh mode conditions in hardware systems. It operates on the positive edge of the user interface clock (ui_clk), resetting the 'soft_cal_selfrefresh_req' to 0 when system resets (via sys_rst). Once the system enters self-refresh mode, denoted by 'selfrefresh_enter_r3', it sets the 'soft_cal_selfrefresh_req' to 1. When both 'selfrefresh_enter_r3' is de-asserted and the PLL lock is achieved, it sets 'soft_cal_selfrefresh_req' back to 0. In all other conditions, 'soft_cal_selfrefresh_req' retains its previous state.
