    "block_comment": "The block of code functions as a timing checker for the 8th bit of the 'addr_in' input. Using the Verilog 'always' keyword, this block of code is designed to trigger whenever the value of the 8th bit of 'addr_in' changes. On every change, it calls the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function with a parameter of 14, performing a timing check on the address signal. Therefore, the block acts as a monitor for the 8th bit's status and is crucial for maintaining correct signal timing within the system."
