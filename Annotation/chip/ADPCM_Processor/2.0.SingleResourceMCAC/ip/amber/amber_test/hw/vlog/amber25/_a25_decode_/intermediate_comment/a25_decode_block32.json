    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code maps a 16-bit instruction code to a 4-bit value through casez statement. The 16-bit instruction is logically ANDed with a mask 'mtrans_reg2_mask' and the masked instruction is processed in the casez match. Depending on the location of the single '1' in the instruction from least significant to most significant bit position, 'mtrans_reg2' is set to a unique 4-bit value ranging from 0 to E. The '????' wildcard is used to match any bit value. If the instruction does not match any of the cases, it defaults to 'mtrans_reg2' being set to F."
