    "block_comment": "This block of code works as a data selector for writing data into a particular module. It uses conditional statements to determine the correct data to write. If `write_hit` is true and `c_state` is idle (CS_IDLE), the block selects 'write_hit_wdata' as the data for writing. If not, the block checks the 'consecutive_write' status. If it is true, the code selects 'consecutive_write_wdata' for writing. Otherwise, it defaults to using 'read_miss_wdata'. This structure is implemented using the ternary operator (`?:`) in Verilog, which reduces the complexity of control flow. The chosen data will be assigned to 'data_wdata'."
