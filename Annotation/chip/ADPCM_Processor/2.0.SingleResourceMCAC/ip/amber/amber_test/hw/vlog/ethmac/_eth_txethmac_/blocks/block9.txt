Comment: 
This block controls the reset functionality and data assignment of the 4-bit vector `MTxD[3:0]`. The process is sensitive to the rising edge of `MTxClk` signal or the positive edge of `Reset`. If the `Reset` is asserted, `MTxD[3:0]` is assigned to 0 after a propagation delay specified by `#Tp`. If `Reset` is not asserted, the previous value held by `MTxD_d[3:0]` is assigned to `MTxD[3:0]` with a delay of `#Tp`.
