    "block_comment": "The block of code handles data generation for Virtex-6 based configuration. It uses the `v6_data_gen` module to generate the required data under different conditions. Mandatory conditions (like FAMILY being \"VIRTEX6\") and a variety of details (like address width, burst length, data mode, etc.) are specified using parameterized variables. The clock and reset signals are input via the `.clk_i` and `.rst_i` ports while communications between modules are other input ports. The output data is relayed outward via the `.data_o` port. The implementation also supports various modes of operation through different `cmd_start` channels, offering high-level configurability and control over the data generation process."
