Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module implements a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM device, simulating its timing, functionality, and behavior. It has input ports for clock (ck, ck_n), control signals (cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank selection (ba, addr), data mask (dm_tdqs), data bus (dq), and data strobe (dqs, dqs_n), as well as reset (rst_n) and on-die termination (odt) signals. The only output port is tdqs_n for termination data strobe. Internally, it uses various signals to track timing, state, and configuration, including clock parameters, mode registers, bank status, and pipeline stages. The module implements tasks for command decoding, data handling, and timing checks. It
