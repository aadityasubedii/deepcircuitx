    "block_comment": "The block's function revolves around managing data input through generating a variety of shift register configurations and parallel data outputs based on specific conditions and controlling the LinkFail signal. Operation is managed by clock cycles and reset conditions. On the rising edge of clock or reset, when reset is high, all output variables are reset to 0. When the clock is on the rising edge and reset is not high, several actions based on MdcEn_n and ByteSelect are performed. When MdcEn_n is high, the Shift Register is loaded with varying data fields depending on ByteSelect value and LinkFail signal gets updated. When MdcEn_n is low, it either loads ShiftReg and Prsd with a concatenated value based on ShiftReg and Mdi or it updates a portion of Prsd based on conditions and updates the LinkFail signal based on ShiftReg's second least significant bit value."
