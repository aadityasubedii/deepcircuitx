    "block_comment": "The block updates the status bits of the fast interrupt request (FIRQ) mask. It works by using a logical OR operation to set 'status_bits_firq_mask_update' when either 'ldm_status_bits' is active or when both 'execute' is active and 'i_core_stall' is inactive and 'i_status_bits_firq_mask_wen' is active."
