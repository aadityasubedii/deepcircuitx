Depending on the i_function, it can perform a standard multiply or an accumulate multiply operation. The result of the multiply is provided on o_out. The module also updates o_flags with status information after execution and the o_done signal is set to indicate the completion of a multiply operation. The operation is sensitive to the i_clk signal, meaning it works synchronously with a clock. It also has functionality to stall the operation when i_fetch_stall is asserted. The module seems to be developed in a way that handles both Xilinx Spartan 6 and Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGAs specifically."
