The block of code is a monitoring trigger for changes in input data. In this Verilog RTL block, an event-driven procedure is initiated utilizing the 'always' keyword. It is conditioned on changes in the 14th bit (indexed 13) of the dq_in data input vector. Once a change is detected, the function 'dq_timing_check' with parameter 13 is triggered. This mechanism can serve as a timing analyzer for the bit in question.
