    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for executing a timing check on the 37th bit (index 36) of the dq_in signal. It utilizes an always block that is sensitive to any changes in the 37th bit of the dq_in signal. Upon a change in this specific bit's state, the timing check procedure 'dq_timing_check' is invoked with the index position 36 as the argument. This architecture assures that the timing of the 37th bit of the dq_in signal is consistently monitored and evaluated for any potential timing issues."
