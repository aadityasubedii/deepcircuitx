    "block_comment": "This Verilog block assigns a specific address to the variable data_address based on specific conditions. If a write operation is consecutive, it takes the missing address within the cache-address range. If there's a write-hit, it uses the input address within the same range. If the source selection is Cache-fill, it uses the missing address again while for Cache-core it uses the regular address. In case none of these conditions are met, it fills the provided width with zeroes."
