    "spec": "Module name: cmd_prbs_gen. \n\nModule specification: The cmd_prbs_gen is a parameterized Verilog module that generates different lengths of pseudo random binary sequences (PRBS) for system testing via a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) technique. The operation of this module is governed by clock signal 'clk_i'. Initialization of PRBS sequence is controlled by 'prbs_seed_init' while the 'clk_en' port enables the clocking of the LFSR logic to generate the PRBS sequence. The initial seed for the sequence is provided through 'prbs_seed_i'. The generated sequence is output through 'prbs_o' port. \n\nInternally, the module makes use of three important signals: ZEROS, prbs, lfsr_q. ZEROS is a wire type signal used for maintaining a zero value of a specified width. The prbs register holds the pseudo-random binary sequence during generation and lfsr_q is utilized as the linear feedback shift register for creating the necessary sequences. \n\nThe code breaks down into several key blocks. At a high level, there are generate-if blocks that are responsible for providing functionality depending on the input parameters 'PRBS_CMD' and 'PRBS_WIDTH'. These blocks implement LFSR formation and PRBS sequence generation logic according to specified parameters. Another important block is the function \"logb2\" which calculates logarithms base 2 for given input. The module also accommodates different parameters in its generation logic, providing the capability to mask certain bits in case of specific address sequence generation.",

The operation of this module is governed by clock signal 'clk_i'. Initialization of PRBS sequence is controlled by 'prbs_seed_init' while the 'clk_en' port enables the clocking of the LFSR logic to generate the PRBS sequence. The initial seed for the sequence is provided through 'prbs_seed_i'. The generated sequence is output through 'prbs_o' port. \n\nInternally, the module makes use of three important signals: ZEROS, prbs, lfsr_q. ZEROS is a wire type signal used for maintaining a zero value of a specified width. The prbs register holds the pseudo-random binary sequence during generation and lfsr_q is utilized as the linear feedback shift register for creating the necessary sequences. \n\nThe code breaks down into several key blocks. At a high level, there are generate-if blocks that are responsible for providing functionality depending on the input parameters 'PRBS_CMD' and 'PRBS_WIDTH'. These blocks implement LFSR formation and PRBS sequence generation logic according to specified parameters. Another important block is the function \"logb2\" which calculates logarithms base 2 for given input. The module also accommodates different parameters in its generation logic, providing the capability to mask certain bits in case of specific address sequence generation."
