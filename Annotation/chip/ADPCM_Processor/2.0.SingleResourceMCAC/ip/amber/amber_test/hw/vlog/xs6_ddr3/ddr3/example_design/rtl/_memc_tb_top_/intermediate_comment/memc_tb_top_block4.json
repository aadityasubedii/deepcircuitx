    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to assign control signals to port three (p3) based on enabled ports and operational mode. If port three is enabled and in the read (RD) mode, it maps signals from other enabled ports, prioritized from port zero to five. If port three is not in read mode or none of the prioritized ports is enabled, default port three signals are assigned. Therefore, this block offers a flexible signal assignment to port three depending on the ports' operational status."
