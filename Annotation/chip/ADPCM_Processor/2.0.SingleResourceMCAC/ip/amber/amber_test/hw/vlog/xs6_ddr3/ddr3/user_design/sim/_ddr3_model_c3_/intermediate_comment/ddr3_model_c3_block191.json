    "block_comment": "This block of code facilitates data reception using a specific edge of the DQS (Data-Strobe) signal. Implementation-wise, the \"always\" keyword is used to execute the function `dqs_odd_receiver` at the instance when the signal `dqs_odd[0]` transitions from low to high (i.e., a positive edge), enabling data reception synchronous to the DQS signal."
