Comment: 
This block describes a reset counter logic in an always block synchronous to the UI_CLK or the positive edge of RST. Upon activating RST, the block's reset signal, Block_Reset, is set to '0' and reset counter, RstCounter, is also initialized to zero. Otherwise, during normal operation, the Block_Reset is initially set to '0', then if Pre_SYSRST is active, RstCounter is loaded with the value of RST_CNT. However, if RstCounter is less than TZQINIT_MAXCNT, the Block_Reset signal is set to '1', indicating an active reset, and RstCounter gets incremented by one.
