    "block_comment": "This block of code deals with selecting the \"way\" in a cache system with two \"ways\" in Verilog language. It uses the ternary logic of Verilog for way selection based on the \"valid_bits_r' signal and a randomly generated number 'random_num'. The 'pick_way' function is used to select next_way based on the state of 'valid_bits_r' and 'random_num'. This feature is beneficial in cache designs where elements can be loaded into one of multiple places, in this case, two-way set associative cache."
