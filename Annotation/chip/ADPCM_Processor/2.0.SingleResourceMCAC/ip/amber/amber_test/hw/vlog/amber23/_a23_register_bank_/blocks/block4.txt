Comment: 
This block is a multiplexer that selects the output `o_rs` based on the 4-bit input `i_rds_sel`. The selection is driven by a case statement: for each of the potential 16 values of the input, a corresponding register output (rN_out or rN_rds) is assigned to `o_rs`. The catch-all "default" case covers all other possible input values, assigning `r15_out_rn` to `o_rs`.
