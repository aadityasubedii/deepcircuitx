    "spec": "Module name: a23_wishbone. \n\nModule specification: The a23_wishbone module interfaces with the Wishbone protocol for synchronous data transmission between peripherals and FPGA cores. It handles read and write requests from a CPU core or cache module and controls different types of service requests using a state machine. The module provides signals to pause operations when Wishbone bus is occupied and exports the status of bus operations for debugging. \n\nThe module has numerous input ports such as `i_clk` for clock signals, `i_select` which enables the module, `i_write_data` for input data, `i_write_enable` to initiate a write operation, `i_byte_enable` for byte selection during write operation, `i_address` as the address location for operations, `i_exclusive` to indicate exclusive access requests and `i_cache_req` for request signals from the cache. There are also inputs from the Wishbone bus itself, `i_wb_dat` for data, `i_wb_ack` for acknowledgement and `i_wb_err` for error handling. The output ports include stalling signal `o_stall`, signals for addressing, byte selection and write commitment to the Wishbone bus (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`), data output for write operations (`o_wb_dat`), signals marking valid bus cycles and validity of data/address (`o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb`). \n\nAdditionally, it uses internal signals like `wishbone_st` and `wbuf_busy_r` which respectively denote state of the Wishbone operation and write buffer status, and signals like `read_ack` and `wait_write_ack` for acknowledgement of read/write operations. The `start_access` and `exclusive_access` signals are used for initiation of core or cache requests and exclusive access request status respectively. The module contains dedicated states for different phases of operation in a state machine implementation. \n\nThe code can be broken down into sections with unique functionality, for instance, several always blocks which handle write buffer operations, data transfer to Wishbone bus and transitions of the Wishbone state machine.",

The module processes read and write requests from a CPU core or from a cache module. It handles different types of service requests like cache requests, exclusive read/write requests, and implements a simple state machine to manage these operations. The output `o_stall` is generated to pause CPU or cache operations when the Wishbone bus is occupied. A write buffer (`wbuf_addr_r`, `wbuf_sel_r`, `wbuf_busy_r`) is implemented to store the address and byte enable signals of a write operation when the Wishbone bus is waiting for an acknowledgment signal.  The status of the Wishbone bus operation is also exported through `xAS_STATE` for debugging purposes."

Explanation: This signal is asserted when the module is currently serving a cache read request.\n8. `byte_enable`. Explanation: This signal determines which bytes to allow in write operations. It's derived from `wbuf_busy_r`, `i_byte_enable` and also depends on core or cache write requests.\n9. `exclusive_access`. Explanation: This signal monitors if the request has exclusive access to the bus. \n10. `read_ack`. Explanation: This signal acknowledges the receipt of non-write Wishbone operations.\n11. `wait_write_ack`. Explanation: This signal is asserted as long as we are waiting for acknowledgment of a write request on the Wishbone bus.\n12. `wb_wait`. Explanation: This signal indicates that the module is waiting for a response from the Wishbone bus.\n13. `wbuf_addr_r`. Explanation: This reg is used as a buffer to hold the write address when the Wishbone bus is waiting for acknowledge signal in write operations.\n14. `wbuf_sel_r`. Explanation: This reg is used as a buffer to hold the write byte enable signals during write operations.\n15. `wbuf_busy_r`. Explanation: This reg is asserted when the write buffer is in use.\n\nEach internal signal plays a critical role in the functioning of the module as they contribute to controlling the flow of operation, management of the states of the module, coordination of read and write operations and global synchronization of the process."

It handles read and write requests from a CPU core or cache module and controls different types of service requests using a state machine. The module provides signals to pause operations when Wishbone bus is occupied and exports the status of bus operations for debugging. \n\nThe module has numerous input ports such as `i_clk` for clock signals, `i_select` which enables the module, `i_write_data` for input data, `i_write_enable` to initiate a write operation, `i_byte_enable` for byte selection during write operation, `i_address` as the address location for operations, `i_exclusive` to indicate exclusive access requests and `i_cache_req` for request signals from the cache. There are also inputs from the Wishbone bus itself, `i_wb_dat` for data, `i_wb_ack` for acknowledgement and `i_wb_err` for error handling. The output ports include stalling signal `o_stall`, signals for addressing, byte selection and write commitment to the Wishbone bus (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`), data output for write operations (`o_wb_dat`), signals marking valid bus cycles and validity of data/address (`o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb`). \n\nAdditionally, it uses internal signals like `wishbone_st` and `wbuf_busy_r` which respectively denote state of the Wishbone operation and write buffer status, and signals like `read_ack` and `wait_write_ack` for acknowledgement of read/write operations. The `start_access` and `exclusive_access` signals are used for initiation of core or cache requests and exclusive access request status respectively. The module contains dedicated states for different phases of operation in a state machine implementation. \n\nThe code can be broken down into sections with unique functionality, for instance, several always blocks which handle write buffer operations, data transfer to Wishbone bus and transitions of the Wishbone state machine."

The module processes read and write requests from a CPU core or from a cache module. It handles different types of service requests like cache requests, exclusive read/write requests, and implements a simple state machine to manage these operations. The output `o_stall` is generated to pause CPU or cache operations when the Wishbone bus is occupied. A write buffer (`wbuf_addr_r`, `wbuf_sel_r`, `wbuf_busy_r`) is implemented to store the address and byte enable signals of a write operation when the Wishbone bus is waiting for an acknowledgment signal.  The status of the Wishbone bus operation is also exported through `xAS_STATE` for debugging purposes."

It handles read and write requests from a CPU core or cache module and controls different types of service requests using a state machine. The module provides signals to pause operations when Wishbone bus is occupied and exports the status of bus operations for debugging. \n\nThe module has numerous input ports such as `i_clk` for clock signals, `i_select` which enables the module, `i_write_data` for input data, `i_write_enable` to initiate a write operation, `i_byte_enable` for byte selection during write operation, `i_address` as the address location for operations, `i_exclusive` to indicate exclusive access requests and `i_cache_req` for request signals from the cache. There are also inputs from the Wishbone bus itself, `i_wb_dat` for data, `i_wb_ack` for acknowledgement and `i_wb_err` for error handling. The output ports include stalling signal `o_stall`, signals for addressing, byte selection and write commitment to the Wishbone bus (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`), data output for write operations (`o_wb_dat`), signals marking valid bus cycles and validity of data/address (`o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb`). \n\nAdditionally, it uses internal signals like `wishbone_st` and `wbuf_busy_r` which respectively denote state of the Wishbone operation and write buffer status, and signals like `read_ack` and `wait_write_ack` for acknowledgement of read/write operations. The `start_access` and `exclusive_access` signals are used for initiation of core or cache requests and exclusive access request status respectively. The module contains dedicated states for different phases of operation in a state machine implementation. \n\nThe code can be broken down into sections with unique functionality, for instance, several always blocks which handle write buffer operations, data transfer to Wishbone bus and transitions of the Wishbone state machine."
