Module-level comment: This module, 'eth_txstatem', forms a key component of an Ethernet communication system, managing different stages of data transmission. It employs a state machine architecture, operated by various input signals such as transmission conditions and frame parameters, to orchestrate the transitions between Idle, Inter-packet Gap, Preamble, Data, PAD, Frame Check Sequence, Jam, Backoff, and Defer states. Internal signals are used to indicate the start of these stages. Combinational and sequential logic are utilized within the module to operate and update the state machine at each clock cycle, achieving robust data transmission control.
