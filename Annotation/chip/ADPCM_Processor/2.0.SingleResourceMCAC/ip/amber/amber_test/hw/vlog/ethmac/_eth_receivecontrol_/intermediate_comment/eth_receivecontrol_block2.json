    "block_comment": "This statement is a bitwise AND operation that helps determine if a timeslot is finished. In this verilog RTL block, `SlotFinished` is assigned the value resulted from the bitwise AND operation between all bits (bitwise reduction operation indicated by the ampersand) of `SlotTimer[5:0]` and `IncrementSlotTimer`. This statement implies a timing control mechanism, where a particular 'SlotTimer' indicates passage of a slot duration. When all bits of 'SlotTimer' becomes 1 while 'IncrementSlotTimer' is also high, 'SlotFinished' signal goes high indicating the end of the timeslot. The usage of bitwise AND operation allows efficient calculation."
