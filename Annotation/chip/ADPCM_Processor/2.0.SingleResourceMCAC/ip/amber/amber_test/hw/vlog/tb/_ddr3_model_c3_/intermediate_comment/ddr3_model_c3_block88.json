    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for monitoring the digital bit sequence input, specifically the 43rd bit, through the dq_in[42] signal. Whenever a change in the signal state occurs, it triggers the dq_timing_check function with a parameter of 42. This facilitates real-time verification of the timing characteristics of the specific bit in the input sequence, ensuring accurate synchronization and functionality."
