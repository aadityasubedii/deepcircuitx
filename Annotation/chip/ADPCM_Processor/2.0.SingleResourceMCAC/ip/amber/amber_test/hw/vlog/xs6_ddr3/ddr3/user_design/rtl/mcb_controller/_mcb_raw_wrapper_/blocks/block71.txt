Comment: 
The block decides the status of command signals based on C_PORT_ENABLE[4]. If the C_PORT_ENABLE[4] signal is active, it assigns the status of the 'mig_p4_cmd*' and 'p4_cmd*' signals to their respective counterparts. The 'mig_p4_cmd_bl' signal is assigned with a value based on the third bit of 'p4_cmd_instr' and the bit-set of value 'p4_cmd_bl'. If the C_PORT_ENABLE[4] signal is not active, all the 'mig_p4_cmd*' and 'p4_cmd*' signals are reset to zero.
