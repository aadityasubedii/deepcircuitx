    "block_comment": "This block of code performs address mapping for memory commands in a multi-port memory interface. The function of the block is to generate row address (ra), bank address (ba), and column address (ca) signals for up to 6 ports based on input byte addresses. The implementation details involve:\n\n1. Conditional logic based on the number of DQ pins (16, 8, or 4) and memory address ordering (ROW_BANK_COLUMN or BANK_ROW_COLUMN).\n2. Bit slicing and concatenation to extract appropriate address bits from the input byte addresses.\n3. Padding with zeros when necessary to match required address widths.\n4. Handling different configurations for memory address width, bank address width, and number of column bits.\n5. Generating separate address signals for each port (p0 to p5) based on the port configuration.\n\nThe code uses generate blocks and conditional assignments to create flexible address mapping that can adapt to various memory configurations and port setups."
