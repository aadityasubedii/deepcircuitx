    "block_comment": "This block manages the 'almost_full' status of a FIFO buffer. It resets the 'almost_full' flag on a reset signal, sets it high when the available space in the buffer is 2 or less and a write enable signal is active, and maintains it at low for all other conditions. The circuit updates on the positive edge of 'wr_clk' clock signal, ensuring synchronous operation. The changes in the 'almost_full' signal are delayed by a clock cycle designated by '#TCQ'."
