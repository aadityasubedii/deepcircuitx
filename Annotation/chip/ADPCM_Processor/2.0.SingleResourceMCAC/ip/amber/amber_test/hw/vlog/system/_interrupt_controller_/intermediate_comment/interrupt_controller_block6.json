    "block_comment": "This block of code sets up write and read data configurations for a system handling Wishbone protocol data width of either 32 or 128 bits. For a 128-bit data width, data packets are divided into four 32-bit subfields using a 2-bit address identifier (i_wb_adr[3:2]). Depending on the address value, the right 32-bit portion of the data is selected (wb_wdata32). All selected data field portions are then concatenated to form 128-bit output (o_wb_dat). If the data width is 32 bits, write data configuration (wb_wdata32) is identical to the input data (i_wb_dat), and the output data (o_wb_dat) directly mirrors the 32-bit read data (wb_rdata32)."
