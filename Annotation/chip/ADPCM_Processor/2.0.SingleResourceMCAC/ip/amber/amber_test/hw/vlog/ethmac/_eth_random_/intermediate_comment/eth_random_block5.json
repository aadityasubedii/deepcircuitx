    "block_comment": "This block of code fills an array 'Random' with elements from the array 'x' based on the RetryCnt value. If the RetryCnt value is greater than the index of the element in the array, the respective index in Random will be filled by the corresponding element from 'x', otherwise, the respective index in 'Random' will be set to zero. The first index of the array, 'Random[0]', is always assigned the value of 'x[0]'. This conditional filling allows for dynamic variation of the values in the 'Random' array based on the 'RetryCnt' count."
