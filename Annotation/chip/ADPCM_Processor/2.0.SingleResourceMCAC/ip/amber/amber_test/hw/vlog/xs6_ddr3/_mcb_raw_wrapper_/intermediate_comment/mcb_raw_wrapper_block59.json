    "block_comment": "This block of code is focused on error checking, status setting, and disabling all commands and control flags in error or inactive scenarios. It is designed to handle both read and write functionalities of two elements: mig_p0 and mig_p1. First, it indicates overflow and error statuses, and identifies if \"read\" function is full. In the second part, it deactivates numerous flags and manages elements' activities using the assign 'b0 command, disabling all command signals, read and write enabling statuses, and clock signals. It also empties the write count as well as read data and status, effectively putting the operation in standby or inactive state."
