    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the reading address for a memory module. It achieves this by assigning the `rd_addr` variable the value of a reading pointer `rd_ptr`, specifically the bits between indices `ASIZE-1` down to `0`. This allows the system to read data from memory at the address specified by the reading pointer."
