    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block represents a timing check task for DQS (Data Strobe) signals in a memory interface scenario. It mainly focuses on evaluating timing violations based on standard timing parameters (e.g., tWLDQSEN, tDQSH, tDS, etc.). Inside the task, it uses a combination of conditional statements and time-based monitoring to display error messages when timing constraints are violated. These timing checks are enforced on actions like DLL (Delay-Locked Loop) being locked, DQS latching edges and write data strobe being high. Also, it prepares the system for the next task by updating variables like tm_dqs, check_dm_tdipw, check_write_dqs_high, tm_dqs_neg, and prev_dqs_in. In case of a DQS signal swap or invalid latching edge, the task generates error messages."
