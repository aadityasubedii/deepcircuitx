    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for generating a reset for the DDR3 type memory. It establishes this functionality through the utilization of the `OBUFT` primitive, which offers an output buffer which allows bidirectional data transfer. When `C_MEM_TYPE` equals \"DDR3\", it allows the reset signal `ioi_rst` to pass to `mcbx_dram_ddr3_rst`, controlling the memory reset operation while 't_rst' is used to tri-state control. This is all encapsulated within a generate-if-endgenerate construct, allowing for decision-dependent hardware generation."
