Comment: 
The given Verilog block handles interrupt signal coding and logging in a processor on a rising clock edge if there's no fetch stall. When the interrupt signal (`i_interrupt`) is not zero and is in an active state (`i_interrupt_state`), the code writes the type of interrupt and the return address to the decompile file. Depending on the type of interrupt (defined by the values from 1 to 5), a corresponding message is written to the file (such as "data abort", "firq", "irq", etc.) and then, corresponding return address is written. The return address is generated by invoking the `get_reg_val` function with particular register numbers associated with each interrupt type.
