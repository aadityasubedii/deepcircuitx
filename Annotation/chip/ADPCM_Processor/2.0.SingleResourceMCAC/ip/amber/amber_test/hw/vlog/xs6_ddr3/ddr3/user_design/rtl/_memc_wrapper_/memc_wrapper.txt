Module-level comment: 
/* 
This module implements a memory controller wrapper supporting multiple ports and memory types.
It interfaces with external memory, handling command, write, and read operations through 
configurable ports. The wrapper manages memory calibration, port arbitration, and AXI4 protocol 
interfacing. It uses a combination of input clocks, reset signals, and port-specific controls 
to coordinate memory operations, while providing status signals and memory interface outputs.
