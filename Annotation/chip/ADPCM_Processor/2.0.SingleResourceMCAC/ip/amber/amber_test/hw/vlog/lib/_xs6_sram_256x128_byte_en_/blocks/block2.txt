Comment: 
The provided Verilog RTL block manages data storage using four Single-Port RAM (SPRAM) units in the FPGA design. The `RAMB8BWER` instances are loop-generated with incrementing ranges for write data, byte write enable, and read data. Each SPRAM operates in Single Data Port (SDP) mode, accepting a 36-bit data width. Read and write operations are processed using a common clock (`i_clk`). Write addresses (`{i_address, 5'd0}`) and the write enable signal (separately for lower (`byte_write_enable[4*i+1:4*i+0]`) and upper(`byte_write_enable[4*i+3:4*i+2]`) bytes) determine to which address the input data (`i_write_data[32*i+31:32*i+16]` for upper bytes and `i_write_data[32*i+15:32*i+ 0]` for lower bytes) is written. Data reading occurs from defined addresses (`{i_address, 5'd0}`) when the write enable is low, and is reflected in the `o_read_data` output signal. Reset and Clock Enable signals are hard-coded to zero.
