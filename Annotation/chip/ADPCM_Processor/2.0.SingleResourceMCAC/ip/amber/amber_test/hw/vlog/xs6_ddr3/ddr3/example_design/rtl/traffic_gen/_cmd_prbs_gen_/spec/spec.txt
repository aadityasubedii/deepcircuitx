Module name: cmd_prbs_gen. 

Module specification: The cmd_prbs_gen is a parameterized Verilog module that generates different lengths of pseudo random binary sequences (PRBS) for system testing via a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) technique. The operation of this module is governed by clock signal 'clk_i'. Initialization of PRBS sequence is controlled by 'prbs_seed_init' while the 'clk_en' port enables the clocking of the LFSR logic to generate the PRBS sequence. The initial seed for the sequence is provided through 'prbs_seed_i'. The generated sequence is output through 'prbs_o' port. 

Internally, the module makes use of three important signals: ZEROS, prbs, lfsr_q. ZEROS is a wire type signal used for maintaining a zero value of a specified width. The prbs register holds the pseudo-random binary sequence during generation and lfsr_q is utilized as the linear feedback shift register for creating the necessary sequences. 

The code breaks down into several key blocks. At a high level, there are generate-if blocks that are responsible for providing functionality depending on the input parameters 'PRBS_CMD' and 'PRBS_WIDTH'. These blocks implement LFSR formation and PRBS sequence generation logic according to specified parameters. Another important block is the function "logb2" which calculates logarithms base 2 for given input. The module also accommodates different parameters in its generation logic, providing the capability to mask certain bits in case of specific address sequence generation.
