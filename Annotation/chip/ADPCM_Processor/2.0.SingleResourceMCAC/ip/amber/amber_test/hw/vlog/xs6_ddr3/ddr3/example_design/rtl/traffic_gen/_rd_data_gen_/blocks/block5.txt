This block handles command readiness responses in a synchronous circuit. It hinges on clock input `clk_i`. During a positive clock edge, if the least significant bit of the reset (`rst_i[0]`) is high, `cmd_rdy` flag is set high after a delay defined by `TCQ` (Time Clock-to-Q). However, if a command start (`cmd_start`) is signaled, `cmd_rdy` is set low after a `TCQ` delay. Lastly, if the data port FIFO is ready (`data_port_fifo_rdy`) and `user_burst_cnt` is equal to 1, `cmd_rdy` is once again set high after a `TCQ` delay. This allows for dynamic command readiness assignment based on different conditions in the system.
