Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code is responsible for generating the signal `tx_push_toggle`. It achieves this by performing an XOR operation (`^`) between the `tx_push` and `tx_push_r` signals. The output `tx_push_toggle` indicates a change in the `tx_push` signal from the previous clock cycle, effectively acting as an edge detector.
