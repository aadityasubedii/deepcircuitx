    "block_comment": "The provided block of code is responsible for controlling the output 'bl_out' based on the state of system flags and mode registers. When the 'mode_load_pulse' flag is set, the 'bl_out' output takes the value of 'fixed_bl_i' at the next positive clock edge. When 'cmd_clk_en' is enabled but 'mode_load_pulse' is unasserted, the behavior of 'bl_out' depends on the value of 'bl_mode_reg', which could either assign it the value of 'bram_bl_i', 'fixed_bl_i', 'prbs_brlen', or the constant 6'h1, all of these assignments happening at the next clock edge."
