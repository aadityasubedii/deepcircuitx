    "spec": "Module name: a25_wishbone. \n\nModule specification: The module a25_wishbone in Verilog is an arbitration unit designed for a multiple buffered Wishbone system with three ports (0-2). The module takes in various input signals such as request signals from three different ports, system clock signal, system reset signal, test mode signal, write data along with their respective byte-enable and addresses from the three ports, and acknowledgement, data and error signals from the Wishbone bus. Output signals include acknowledgement to each request from three different ports, addresses, data, write enable signals, and read data for the ports to send access request to the Wishbone bus. \n\nThe module includes a variety of internal signals that help manage buffer state, read-write requests, validity of data, and track the current bus access transaction. It signals if the data in any buffer is valid and ready to be written, if any request from a buffer is being accepted for bus access, whether it is a read or write request, the addresses to read/write from, and validity of the read data from the bus. A signal also indicates if there\u2019s a new bus access request and another keeps track of which port\u2019s request is being served currently. \n\nThe module encompasses different blocks for ports 0-2 and are instantiated with an identifier starting with \"u_a25_wishbone_buf_p\". For each block, the interface includes input and output signals related to the data flow, read and write requests, and buffer management signals associated with each port. The assignment blocks calculate whether there is a new bus access request and assigns which port\u2019s buffer request is accepted based on a priority defined in the module. The always block handles the arbitration among the buffers, deciding which buffer's data gets to go to the Wishbone bus (lower index buffer takes priority), and managing the subsequent Wishbone bus operations like writing data to the bus or reading data from the bus. Another assignment block checks whether the read data from the Wishbone bus is valid or not. The functionality is designed around a 3-port arbitrated Wishbone bus interface that efficiently manages requests from three different ports and accesses the shared Wishbone bus resources based on a priority mechanism.",

Output ports signify the result of the module operation, signals or data going out from the module to the next stage. For this particular a25_wishbone module, input ports mainly include requests signals, data, and addresses to write from three different ports, and acknowledgment, data and error signals from the Wishbone bus. On the other hand, output ports provide acknowledgement to each request from three different ports and send address, data, and other signals for accessing the Wishbone bus. It also sends out read data to the three ports."

The module takes in various input signals such as request signals from three different ports, system clock signal, system reset signal, test mode signal, write data along with their respective byte-enable and addresses from the three ports, and acknowledgement, data and error signals from the Wishbone bus. Output signals include acknowledgement to each request from three different ports, addresses, data, write enable signals, and read data for the ports to send access request to the Wishbone bus. \n\nThe module includes a variety of internal signals that help manage buffer state, read-write requests, validity of data, and track the current bus access transaction. It signals if the data in any buffer is valid and ready to be written, if any request from a buffer is being accepted for bus access, whether it is a read or write request, the addresses to read/write from, and validity of the read data from the bus. A signal also indicates if there\u2019s a new bus access request and another keeps track of which port\u2019s request is being served currently. \n\nThe module encompasses different blocks for ports 0-2 and are instantiated with an identifier starting with \"u_a25_wishbone_buf_p\". For each block, the interface includes input and output signals related to the data flow, read and write requests, and buffer management signals associated with each port. The assignment blocks calculate whether there is a new bus access request and assigns which port\u2019s buffer request is accepted based on a priority defined in the module. The always block handles the arbitration among the buffers, deciding which buffer's data gets to go to the Wishbone bus (lower index buffer takes priority), and managing the subsequent Wishbone bus operations like writing data to the bus or reading data from the bus. Another assignment block checks whether the read data from the Wishbone bus is valid or not. The functionality is designed around a 3-port arbitrated Wishbone bus interface that efficiently manages requests from three different ports and accesses the shared Wishbone bus resources based on a priority mechanism."
