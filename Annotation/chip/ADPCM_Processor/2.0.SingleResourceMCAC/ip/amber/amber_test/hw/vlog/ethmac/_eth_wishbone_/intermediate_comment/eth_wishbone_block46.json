    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a data latch, which captures and stores received data based on various conditions. The functionality is triggered at the positive edge of 'MRxClk' or 'Reset'. On 'Reset', the 'RxDataLatched1' is cleared. If 'RxValid', 'RxReady', and not 'LastByteIn' are all true, the code examines whether 'RxStartFrm' or 'RxEnableWindow' holds. They each have four cases depending on 'RxPointerLSB_rst' or 'RxByteCnt', respectively. A new byte of 'RxData' gets latched into a different byte position of 'RxDataLatched1' depending on the case, forming 32-bits piece of data over four clock cycles."
