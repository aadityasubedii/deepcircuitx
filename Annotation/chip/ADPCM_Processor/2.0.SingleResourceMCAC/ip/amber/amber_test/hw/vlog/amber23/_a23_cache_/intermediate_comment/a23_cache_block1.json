    "block_comment": "This block of code is meant to provide a warning error message for an unsupported cache configuration. When the cache's 'ways' parameter (representing the number of cache lines) doesn't meet specified standards (2,3,4, or 8), the system produces error messages on the console output indicating an unsupported number of ways and suggests the user to set A23_CACHE_WAYS in the \"a23_config_defines.v\" file to the accepted figures. This is achieved via initial block to execute at the start of simulation combined with `$display` system tasks to print formatted strings into the simulator's standard output."
