    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for conditional compilation and to instantiate a module called \"generic_sram_byte_en\". The instantiation is conditionally compiled only if XILINX_FPGA is not defined, which means this code is specific to non-Xilinx FPGA designs. The \"generic_sram_byte_en\" module is parameterized with two arguments: DATA_WIDTH that sets the width of the data bus and ADDRESS_WIDTH that determines the size of the memory that can be addressed."
