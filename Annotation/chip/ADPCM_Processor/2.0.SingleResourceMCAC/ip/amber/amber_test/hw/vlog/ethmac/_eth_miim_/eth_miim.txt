Module-level comment: The eth_miim module manages communications between MAC and PHY components in Ethernet devices. It handles operations for writing control data, reading status data, scanning status data, among others. It utilizes internal signals to track operation progress and maintains data latching for status reading. Inputs include clock, reset, control data, PHY information, and operation signals. Outputs represent operation status, control & status clock signal, validity of status info, and output control details. The module is designed with three blocks: eth_clockgen for clock generation, eth_shiftreg for shifting operations, and eth_outputcontrol for output control.
