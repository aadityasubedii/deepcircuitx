    "block_comment": "The given block is tailored to assign appropriate data generation function to `w1data` on the positive edge of the clock cycle, depending on address input and data mode status. It primarily concerns with data write functionality considering specific command start and readiness conditions. `w1data` is assigned with data yielded by respective function `Data_Gen` or `Data_GenW0`, depending on the `addr_i[9:5]` value and `data_mode_i` with certain timing constraint `#TCQ`. The functions are indexed with values 0 to 29 to support different data scenarios. If the `addr_i[9:5]` value doesn't match any of the cases then the `w1data` is set to zero."
