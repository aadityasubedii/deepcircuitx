    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is responsible for triggering a function called dq_timing_check whenever there's a change in the 21st bit of the dq_in data. The always keyword means this block of code keeps looking for changes in the specified bit of dq_in, and whenever it detects such a change, it calls the dq_timing_check function with the argument 20. This ensures that the timing is checked consistently for this significant bit."
