This block of code checks for potentially erroneous input conditions for port 5. If an attempt is made to use port 5 (which is read-only) in write mode, it displays an error message and terminates the program. This is implemented by checking the C_PORT_CONFIG bits (23 down to 0) if they signal "R32", the enable signal p5_cmd_en is high, and the third and first bit of the p5_cmd_instr are zeros, in which case it flags an error. Both displaying the error message to simulate the console and terminating the program are achieved using the $display and $finish system tasks respectively.
