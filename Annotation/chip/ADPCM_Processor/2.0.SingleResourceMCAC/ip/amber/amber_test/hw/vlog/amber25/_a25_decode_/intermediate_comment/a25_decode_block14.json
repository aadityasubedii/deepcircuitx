    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a control logic that triggers when the system is in the multiply-accumulate state (`MULT_ACCUMU`). During this state, the multiplication function is set to the next operating cycle and the program counter write-enable (`pc_wen_nxt`) is turned off. It also sets the instruction address select (`iaddress_sel_nxt`) to the value 3 for selection purposes in the next state."
