    "block_comment": "This block of code, labeled \"LOAD_RZQ_PTERM\", is responsible for initiating a write operation to a memory cell. Here's how it accomplishes this; it first validates the command (IODRPCTRLR_CMD_VALID), assigns a memory cell address (IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR) and assigns write data (IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA) along with specifying the operation mode (IODRPCTRLR_R_WB). The state machine then checks if the memory cell is ready or busy (IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N). If it's ready, it recursively calls \"LOAD_RZQ_PTERM\". If it's busy, it transits to the \"WAIT2\" state."
