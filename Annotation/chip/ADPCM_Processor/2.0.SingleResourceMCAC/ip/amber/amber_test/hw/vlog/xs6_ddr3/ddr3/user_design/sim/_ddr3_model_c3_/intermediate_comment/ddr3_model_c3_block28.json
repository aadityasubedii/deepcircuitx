    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a timing check carried out during the negative edge transition of dqs_in at position 4. The always block triggers a delay-sensitive routine \u2013 dqs_neg_timing_check passing \"4\" as an argument, every time there is a negative edge transition in 'dqs_in' at index 4 signifying a delay or disturbance has occurred. This essentially ensures that the data input stream 'dqs_in' maintains proper timing and avoids data corruption."
