Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for handling reset and write operations for a specific data register in a synchronous manner. On every rising edge of the clock or reset signal, the block checks whether the reset flag is true, it resets the data register to a default state. If a write hit or a consecutive write operation is detected, the block updates the data register with the latest write data.
