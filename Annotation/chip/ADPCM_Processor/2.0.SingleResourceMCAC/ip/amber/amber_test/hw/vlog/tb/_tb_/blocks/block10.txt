Comment: 
Please note the code block shared just contains a compile time directive (`ifdef), which is not complete to summarize or comment. It seems to start a block of code that would only be compiled if the AMBER_LOAD_MAIN_MEM macro is defined. You should share the complete code block to generate a meaningful summary and understand its functionality.

However, following the expected comment style:

"This block is a conditional compilation directive specific to the Amber load main memory configuration. The functionalities and subsequent code within this block will only be compiled and become part of the final binary when the AMBER_LOAD_MAIN_MEM definition is enabled."
