Comment: 
This block is a synchronous reset able latch for acknowledgment flag. It is triggered on rising edges of either the reset signal or the clock signal. On system reset, it clears the acknowledgment flag. During normal operation, it sets the flag (ack_owed_r) when a push operation occurs with incoming write request and if there is no outgoing acknowledgment yet. Alternatively, it clears the flag when there is no incoming request and an outgoing acknowledgment signal is active.
