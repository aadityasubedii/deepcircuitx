    "block_comment": "This block of code illustrates the workings of a write buffer in a digital system, such as CPU. It does so by handling synchronous reset and clock signals. When a reset event occurs, it scrubbes the write buffer\u2019s data, address, write enable signal, byte enable, and pointer. Otherwise, when the push command is received, the data, address, and write enable signals are received from the input and stored into the write buffer\u2019s respective fields corresponding to the current writing pointer\u2019s position. It also updates byte enable based on the write command, with the byte enable taking on a default '16'hffff value if write is not enabled. Ultimately, the writing pointer's location is toggled to facilitate subsequent push actions."
