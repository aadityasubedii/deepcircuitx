    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code configures the value of `lsr_mask` based on the pattern of `lsr_selector`. Depending on the value of `lsr_selector`, a specific assignment to `lsr_mask` is triggered. If `lsr_selector` matches `'b1??`, then `lsr_mask` is set to `33'h_1_0000_0000`. A match with `'b01?` assigns `lsr_mask` with the value `33'h_0_0000_0000`. For `'b000`, `lsr_mask` gets both a high-order bit and a bit-swapped `low_mask` followed by `16'h_ffff`. For `'b001`, `lsr_mask` gets `17'h_1_0000` and bit-swapped `low_mask`. The `casez` statement is used for pattern matching of the `lsr_selector` in this implementation."
