Comment: 
This block acts as a data write module, handling the integration of incoming write data (`i_write_data`) with previously read data (`o_read_data`) based on a `byte_enable` code. Depending on the `byte_enable` code values, different parts of the incoming write data will be integrated with the read data. For byte enable '0001', the lower byte of the write data is combined with the upper three bytes of the read data. Conversely for '0010', the second byte of the write data is combined with the first, third, and fourth bytes of the read data. The pattern follows according to which bit in the `byte_enable` code is set. If multiple bits are enabled, more bytes from the write data replace the respective bytes of the read data in the resulting `write_data_word`. When all byte enables are off, `i_write_data` alone is assigned to `write_data_word`.
