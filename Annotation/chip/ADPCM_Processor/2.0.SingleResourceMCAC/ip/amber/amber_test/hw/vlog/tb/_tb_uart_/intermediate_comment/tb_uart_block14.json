    "block_comment": "This block of code corresponds to the operation of a UART (universal asynchronous receiver transmitter) receiver. It consists of three main parts: a reset, a shift register for incoming data, and a finite state machine (FSM) to selectively handle this data. On encountering a reset condition, it initializes all relevant variables and counters to default ('d0). In the case of the rising edge of the UART clock and absence of a reset condition, the code uses a shift register operation to sample new incoming data while shifting the old data, and checks for a 'start bit'. The FSM then determines how to process the received bit based on its current state. It initially waits for a start bit, then reads the subsequent 8 bits, and finally reverts to its initial state after finishing a byte reading and checking for the particular conditions given."
