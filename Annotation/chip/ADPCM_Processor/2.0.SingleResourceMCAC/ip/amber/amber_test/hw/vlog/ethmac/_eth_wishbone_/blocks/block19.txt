This block of code manages a latch, 'RxAbortLatched', related to the 'abort' condition in the receiver hardware, triggered either by a reset condition or when the receiver abort (RxAbort) is commanded. The latch 'RxAbortLatched' is asynchronously reset with 'Reset' or 'RxAbortSyncb2' events. If these are not triggered but an abort request 'RxAbort' is made, 'RxAbortLatched' is set. The code strictly follows reset, set priority order and ensures metastability prevention with posedge triggering to adhere to the synchronous design principles.
