    "block_comment": "The given block of code represents a flip-flop with synchronous reset functionality. It is triggered on the rising edge of either the clock signal (`Clk`) or the reset signal (`Reset`). When a positive edge is detected on the `Reset` input, the variable `SetRxCIrq_sync1` is synchronously reset to `1'b0`, which means low level or false. However, if a rising edge is detected on `Clk`, the variable `SetRxCIrq_sync1` is set to the value of `SetRxCIrq_rxclk`. The propagation delay (`#Tp`) included in the assignments of `SetRxCIrq_sync1` implies that this process isn't instantaneous and emulates real-world hardware conditions."
