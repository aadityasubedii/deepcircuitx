    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a register that is updated on the positive edge of the input clock signal (clk_i). If the 7th bit of the reset input signal (rst_i[6]) is high, the input value referred to as fixed_bl_i is loaded into the register after a delay specified by TCQ. If that is not the case, and the bl_out_vld signal is true, the value bl_out is loaded into the register, also after a delay specified by TCQ."
