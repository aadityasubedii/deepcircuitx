This block of code is used to initialize and control a system reset signal named c3_sys_rst in the given digital circuit. Initially, it sets the c3_sys_rst signal low. Then, after a delay of 20000 time units, the c3_sys_rst signal is set high to assert the system reset. This ensures the system starts with a known stable state and can be used for synchronization purposes.
