Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for updating the value of `ReceiveEnd` at every positive edge of the `MRxClk` clock or when a `Reset` occurs. When `Reset` is high, it asynchronously clears `ReceiveEnd` to 0 with a delay equal to the propagation time (`Tp`). If `Reset` is not high, i.e., during normal operation, it synchronously copies the value of `LoadRxStatus` to `ReceiveEnd` at the positive edge of `MRxClk`, again with a delay of `Tp`. This way, it helps in managing the receiving end in communication applications based on the status of `LoadRxStatus` and `Reset`.
