Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: The memc_wrapper module is a comprehensive wrapper for a memory controller (MCB) interface, designed to support multiple memory types, including DDR3. It provides six configurable ports for command, write, and read operations, allowing flexible interaction with external memory. The module handles memory calibration, arbitration between ports, and interfaces with the AXI4 protocol. Key input ports include clocks (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), reset (async_rst), and port-specific signals for commands, writes, and reads. Output ports encompass memory interface signals (e.g., mcbx_dram_addr, mcbx_dram_ba) and status indicators. Internal signals manage calibration (e.g., C_MC_CALIBRATION_CLK_DIV), configuration (e.g., C_SKIP_D
