Comment: 
This Verilog block handles the reading of multiple data registers within an Ethernet module subsystem. According to the given address and the read flag, it maps the address to its corresponding data register output. In cases where the address refers to specific data registers, such as ETH_MODER_ADR, ETH_INT_SOURCE_ADR, ETH_INT_MASK_ADR, and others (up to ETH_TX_CTRL_ADR), the data output (DataOut) is set to the register's output. If an invalid address is detected or if the read flag is not active, the data output defaults to zero.
