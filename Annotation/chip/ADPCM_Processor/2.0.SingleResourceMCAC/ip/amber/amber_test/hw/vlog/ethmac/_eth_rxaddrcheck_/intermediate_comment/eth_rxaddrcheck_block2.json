    "block_comment": "The block of code is primarily a selection or control structure, which determines which part of the 'IntHash' 32-bit register will be assigned to the 'ByteHash' 8-bit register based on the 2-bit 'CrcHash' value. The block does this by using a case statement that uses the 2 bits from 'CrcHash'[4:3] to select the appropriate 8-bit subset from the 32-bit 'IntHash'. This selection process happens anytime there is a change to 'CrcHash' or 'IntHash'."
