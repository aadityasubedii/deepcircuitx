Module-level comment: The a25_barrel_shift module performs barrel shift operations on a 32-bit input, controlled by a 2-bit function signal and an 8-bit shift signal. Shift operations occur in either "quick" mode for smaller shift amounts, or "full" mode for larger shift amounts, indicated by a stall signal, with results and carry information passed as outputs. Internal signals and registers handle data and control 'quick' or 'full' modes, and the 'quick' or 'full' operation status from the previous clock cycle. The module includes instances of an a25_shifter block for both modes of operation.
