    "block_comment": "This block triggers the timing check procedure `dq_timing_check` whenever there is a change in the 26th bit of the `dq_in` input data vector. Specifically, the 'always' keyword in Verilog is used to define a free-running procedure; here, it's combined with the @() operator to specify an event control. Thus it's evident that the code  monitors the 26th bit of `dq_in` array and calls the `dq_timing_check` function with a parameter of 25 whenever a change is detected."
