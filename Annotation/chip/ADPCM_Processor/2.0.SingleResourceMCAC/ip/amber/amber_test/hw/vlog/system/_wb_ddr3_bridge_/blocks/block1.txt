This block of Verilog code is used to display read and write operations of DDR3 memory. Upon each rising edge of the input clock signal 'i_clk', when 'start_write' is asserted, this block displays the write address, data, and byte enables of memory write data operation. Similarly, if the 'i_rd_empty' signal is de-asserted (meaning thereâ€™s data to be read), it exhibits the address and data for memory read operations. The data for both read and write operations is divided into 4 32-bit wide portions for a clear presentation.
