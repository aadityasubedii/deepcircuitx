This block is responsible for accepting and storing the incoming 'data_valid_i' signal on the rising edge of 'clk_i'. This action is implemented using an always block, which executes whenever there's a positive edge of clock ('clk_i'), where the 'data_valid_r' is assigned the value of 'data_valid_i' asynchronously after a delay of #TCQ time units.
