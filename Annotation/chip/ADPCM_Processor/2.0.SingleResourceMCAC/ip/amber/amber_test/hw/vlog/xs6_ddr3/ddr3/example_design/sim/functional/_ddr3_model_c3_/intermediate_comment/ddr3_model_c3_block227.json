    "block_comment": "The block of code functions to calculate the absolute value of a real number. It does this by taking a real number 'arg' as input. It then checks if 'arg' is less than zero, and if true, it multiplies 'arg' by -1 to make it positive. Otherwise, 'arg' is already a positive number and is returned as is."
