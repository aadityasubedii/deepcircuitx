    "block_comment": "This block generates instructions for a Pseudo Random Bit Sequence (PRBS). This functionality is achieved by instantiating two instances of the `cmd_prbs_gen` module, namely `instr_prbs_gen_a` and `instr_prbs_gen_b`. The PRBS is controlled via a clock input (`clk_i`), a clock enable signal (`clk_en`), an initial PRBS seed (`prbs_seed_init`), and a PRBS seed input (`prbs_seed_i`). Two outputs `prbs_instr_a` and `prbs_instr_b` are generated, representing two distinct PRBS produced for simulation or testing of digital equipment."
