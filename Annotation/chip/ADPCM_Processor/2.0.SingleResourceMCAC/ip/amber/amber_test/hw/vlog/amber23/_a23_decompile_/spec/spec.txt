Module name: a23_decompile. Module specification: The a23_decompile module is a decompiler for an ARM-like processor architecture, designed to generate human-readable assembly-like output from executed instructions. It takes various input signals related to instruction execution, including clock (i_clk), fetch stall (i_fetch_stall), instruction data (i_instruction), validity flags, interrupt signals, and program counter information. The module has no output ports, instead writing debug information to a file specified by the A23_DECOMPILE_FILE macro. Internally, it uses signals to decode instruction components (e.g., opcodes, registers, immediate values) and execution status flags. The module is organized into several functional blocks: instruction decoding, condition handling, register and operand formatting, and file output generation. It processes different instruction types (e.g., register operations, memory transfers, branches) and handles special cases
