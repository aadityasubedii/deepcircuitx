    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for multiplexing outputs based on the input select signal. It essentially implements a 16-to-1 multiplexer where the selection signal, 'i_rs_sel', decides which output signal 'o_rs' takes the value from. For each value of the 4-bit 'i_rs_sel', ranging from 0 to 14, 'o_rs' is assigned the value of a different corresponding output (r0_out to r14_rds). For all other values of 'i_rs_sel', 'o_rs' is assigned the default value 'r15_out_rn'."
