    "block_comment": "This block of code is a DQS signal receiver for DDR memory interfacing. It listens for a positive edge in the DQS (Data Strobe) signal, indicating incoming data to be processed. The always @ block is triggered whenever there is a positive edge on the dqs_even[ 2] signal wherein it calls the function `dqs_even_receiver( 2)` to handle the received data."
