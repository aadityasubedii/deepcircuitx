Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is responsible for conditionally assigning a data value to the 'rdpath_rd_data_i' signal. The 'rdpath_rd_data_i' signal will be assigned 'rd_v6_mdata' if the 'FAMILY' is "VIRTEX6" and the 'MEM_BLEN' equals 4. Otherwise, the 'rdpath_rd_data_i' signal will be assigned the value of 'mcb_rd_data_i'. Both 'rd_v6_mdata' and 'mcb_rd_data_i' are data signals input into the system. Therefore, this process is used for routing specific data inputs to a signal based on the defined constants, serving different data configurations for hardware usage.
