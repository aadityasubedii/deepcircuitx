This block of code is primarily responsible for invoking the dqs_neg_timing_check function during the positive edge trigger of the dqs_in signal's 21st bit. The implementation is quite straightforward: It uses a Verilog always block and a positive edge sensitivity list to call the dqs_neg_timing_check(20) function only when there's a transition from low to high in the dqs_in[20] signal.
