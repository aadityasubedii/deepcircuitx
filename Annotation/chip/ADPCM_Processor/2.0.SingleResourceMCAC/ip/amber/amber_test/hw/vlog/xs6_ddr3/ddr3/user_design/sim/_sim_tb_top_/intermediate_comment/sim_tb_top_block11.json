    "block_comment": "The highlighted Verilog code block is responsible for initializing the system clock signal 'c3_sys_clk' as low or 0. The implementation accomplishes this by using an initial block to set the 'c3_sys_clk' to a zero bit. This initial block runs once at the time zero of simulation to enforce the initial state of the system clock."
