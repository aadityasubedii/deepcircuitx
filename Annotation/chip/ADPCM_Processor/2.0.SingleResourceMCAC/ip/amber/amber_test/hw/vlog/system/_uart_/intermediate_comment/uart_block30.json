    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code controls a FIFO (First In, First Out) memory buffer for receiving data, which is clocked by `i_clk` and enabled by `fifo_enable`. In the FIFO-enabled scenario, the system first checks if the FIFO is not full (`rx_fifo_push_not_full`) and if so, it adds the incoming item (`rx_byte`) to the buffer at the write pointer location (`rx_fifo_wp`). It then increments the pointer. If the FIFO is not empty (`rx_fifo_pop_not_empty`), it increments the read pointer(`rx_fifo_rp`). The buffer counter(`rx_fifo_count`) increases or decreases accordingly based on whether data has been added or removed. This block also monitors full or empty states of the buffer and updates `rx_fifo_full` and `rx_fifo_empty`. It maintains a timer(`rx_int_timer`) which resets if FIFO is empty or is popping more data and increments as long as it's less than a max limit(`RX_INTERRUPT_COUNT`). In the FIFO-disabled case, the system simply adds or removes data to/from a single registry with respective status registers updated."
