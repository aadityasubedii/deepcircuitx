Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code delineates a multiplexing function for selecting between two sets of data. Depending on the boolean condition `r_LoopBck`, it either assigns the value of `mtxd_pad_o[3:0]` to `MRxD_Lb[3:0]` or assigns `mrxd_pad_i[3:0]` to `MRxD_Lb[3:0]`. This is achieved via the ternary operator `? :`, probing the value of `r_LoopBck` and selecting the appropriate data source.
