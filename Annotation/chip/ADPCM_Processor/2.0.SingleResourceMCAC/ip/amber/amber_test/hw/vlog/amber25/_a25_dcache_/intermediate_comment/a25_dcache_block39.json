    "block_comment": "The provided block of Verilog RTL code has two main operations. The 'request_pulse' is generated when both 'i_request' and 'i_cache_enable' inputs are true. Similarly, the 'exclusive_access' is granted when 'i_exclusive' and 'i_cache_enable' signals are true. These assignment operations enable condition-based control of 'request_pulse' and 'exclusive_access' signals in a cache system, ensuring system functionality only when the cache is enabled and relevant conditions are met."
