    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is primarily responsible for data generation based on the input address signal and data mode. It implements this function using various conditional blocks and case verilog structure. At each clock cycle, depending on the command start signal, the block checks the values of the top 5 bits of the address input and depending on these values and data mode, assigns a function-generated value to w1data. If the memory burst length equals 8, the data value is manipulated by a shift operation."
