This block serves as a delay loop, awaiting the completion of an operation before transitioning the system's state. The block checks if the 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' is inactive(low). If it is, the system remains in the current 'WAIT3' state, essentially implementing a hold until 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' becomes active. Once 'IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N' is active(high), indicating the operation is complete, the system state is directed to 'LOAD_ZIO_NTERM'.
