This block of code represents a state machine control function within a larger digital system. It uses a positive clock edge to drive transitions, in sync with DRP_CLK. On the event of a 'sync_rst' signal, the system state resets to the READY state. If there isn't a 'sync_rst' signal, the state transitions to 'nextstate', which is deduced by other parts of the code.
