Comment: 
This block of code controls a data reception process on an edge-triggered event. It is watching for a positive edge (or rising edge) on the signal `dqs_odd[ 6]`. When this positive edge event occurs, the function `dqs_odd_receiver(6)` is invoked, which likely handles a specific data received task for the associated DQS line.
