    "block_comment": "This code block handles memory buffer command enable operations. Specifically, this block waits until the next positive edge of the input clock (clk_i). When the memory buffer command enable input (mcb_cmd_en_i) is true, the block assigns the value of memory buffer command bit length input (mcb_cmd_bl_i) to the memory buffer command bit length register (mcb_cmd_bl_r). This register is updated with new values synchronously with the clock input, which means it's a typical D flip-flop operation in synchronous digital design."
