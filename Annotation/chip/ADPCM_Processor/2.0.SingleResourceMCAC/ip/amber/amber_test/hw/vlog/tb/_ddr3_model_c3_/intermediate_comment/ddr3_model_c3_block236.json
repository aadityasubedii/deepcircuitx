    "block_comment": "This block is an always block that gets activated whenever there's a change in the signals 'dqs' or 'dqs_n'. It employs a non-blocking assignment to update 'dqs_in' with the 'BUS_DELAY' of a bitwise concatenation operation. The operation includes shifting 'dqs_n' by 16 bits to the left and applying a bitwise OR operation with 'dqs'. Thus, it essentially ensures that 'dqs_in' reflects the delayed state of 'dqs' and 'dqs_n' signals in the circuit."
