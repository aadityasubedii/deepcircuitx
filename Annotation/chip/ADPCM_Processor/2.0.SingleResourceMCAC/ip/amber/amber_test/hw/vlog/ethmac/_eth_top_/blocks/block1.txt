Comment: 
The block assigns a memory write-back address output. It achieves this function by combining a temporary variable, `m_wb_adr_tmp`, with a 2-bit hexadecimal zero, concatenated using the `{}` operator. The output of this concatenation produces the final 32-bit memory address, which is then forwarded to the address output, `m_wb_adr_o`.
