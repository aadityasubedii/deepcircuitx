The block primarily handles the setup and transitions for the write process to an IO memory cell for non-terminated UDQS clock cycles. This is mainly facilitated via an asynchronous sequential circuit. The memory cell address is assigned the non-termination value while the mode is set as 'WRITE_MODE'. The data to be written is a 2 bit value combining a constant bit value of 0 and current non-termination bit state. The critical UDQS clock signal is set and the valid bit for the memory cell is raised. Based on the 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N' feedback signal, the state machine transitions between UDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM and UDQS_CLK_N_TERM_WAIT states ensuring readiness for the next write operation.
