    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_wishbone module is an arbitration unit for a 3-ported multiple buffered Wishbone system. It handles requests from 3 ports, arbitrating based on an internal priority mechanism, and manages data buffering and bus access interactions. The design consists of individual blocks for each port and uses internal signals to track buffer state and request status, prioritizing lower index buffers for bus access. This manages the write/read operations to/from the Wishbone bus efficiently, coordinating the multiplexing of bus access between 3 request buffers."
