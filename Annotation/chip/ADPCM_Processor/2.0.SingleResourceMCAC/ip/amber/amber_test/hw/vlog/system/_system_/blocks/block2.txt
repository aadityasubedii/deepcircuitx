This block is a Wishbone Arbiter which serves as an interconnection point for multiple hardware modules on the Wishbone bus network. The arbiter ensures proper data transmission and prevents data collision by managing which module gets bus access. It achieves this function by controlling several bidirectional data and control lines. For instance, input signals `i_m0_wb_adr` to `i_m0_wb_stb` manage the address, data line selection, write enable signal, data input/output, and bus cycle/strobe signals for the first master module, while the output signals `o_m0_wb_ack` to `o_m0_wb_err` provide acknowledgement, data read, and error signals back to the module. The similar form exists for the other master modules `m1` and slave modules `s0`- `s7` as well. Thus, the block maps each master module to multiple slave modules, controlling data transmission traffic on the multi-line bus.
