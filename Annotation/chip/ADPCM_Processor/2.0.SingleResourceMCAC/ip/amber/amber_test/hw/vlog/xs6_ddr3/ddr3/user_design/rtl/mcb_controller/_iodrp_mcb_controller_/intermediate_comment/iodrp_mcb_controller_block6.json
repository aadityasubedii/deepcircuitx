    "block_comment": "The block of code is used in controlling the state of the \"AddressPhase\" based on the DRP_CLK clock edge. Upon each positive edge of the DRP_CLK, if the synchronous reset signal \"sync_rst\" is active, \"AddressPhase\" is set to zero. Otherwise, when the system is not in the reset stage, \"AddressPhase\" behaves differently based on its current state. When \"AddressPhase\" is true, it remains true as long as the state is not ALMOST_READY2. Conversely, \"AddressPhase\" would turn true if currently the state is ADDR_PHASE, and \"bit_cnt\" equals to binary 111 (decimal seven)."
