    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a write data path in a configurable memory system. It is utilized when the port mode is set to write mode or bidirectional mode. The write_data_path module instantiation is parameterized with various parameters like timing constraint (TCQ), memory burst length, address width, and data pattern among others. The input and output signals are also connected to various system signals for functionality, including system clock (clk_i), reset signal (rst_i), address input signal (addr_i), and data ready signal (data_rdy_i) etc. This allows the module to write data to the memory system when the write request is initiated and the memory is not full."
