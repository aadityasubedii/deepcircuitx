    "block_comment": "This block of code triggers a timing check operation for the 16th bit of the 'dq_in' signal. Specifically, the 'always' keyword ensures that the timing check is carried out whenever there is a change in the value of the 16th bit. This operation is implemented by calling the 'dq_timing_check' function with input '15', which represents the specific bit for which the check is performed."
