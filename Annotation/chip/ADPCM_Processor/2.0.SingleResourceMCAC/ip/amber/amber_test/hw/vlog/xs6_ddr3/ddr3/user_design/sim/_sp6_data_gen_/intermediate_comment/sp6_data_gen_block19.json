    "block_comment": "This block sets bit patterns for variables BLANK and SHIFT_0 to SHIFT_7 based on the input variable data_mode_i. When data_mode_i is '101' or '100', all shifts and BLANK are assigned a unique power of 2, with BLANK being '00'. A similar pattern happens when data_mode_i is '100'. However, when the data_mode_i is '110' or any other value, each shift and BLANK receive their complement bit patterns, effectively flipping every bit."
