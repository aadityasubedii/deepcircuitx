Comment: 
The block of code primarily serves to assign a value to `tag_wenable`. It enables writing to the 'tag' depending on the condition associated with 'source_sel'. This is achieved using a nested conditional (ternary) operator. If 'source_sel' is 'C_INVA', 'C_FILL', or 'C_INIT', then `tag_wenable` is set to 1. If 'source_sel' is 'C_CORE' or any other value not explicitly noted, `tag_wenable` takes the value 0, thereby disabling the writing to the 'tag'.
