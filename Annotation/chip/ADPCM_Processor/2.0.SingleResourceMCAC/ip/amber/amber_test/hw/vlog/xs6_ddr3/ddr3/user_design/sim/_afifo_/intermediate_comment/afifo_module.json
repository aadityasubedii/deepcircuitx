    "module": "Module-level comment: The afifo module implements an asynchronous FIFO queue with capacity tuned through DSIZE and FIFO_DEPTH. It employs separate write and read clocks 'wr_clk' and 'rd_clk', along with control signals including reset, write enable and read enable. The queue manages its memory using internal signals like 'mem', 'rd_gray', 'rd_gray_nxt', 'wr_gray', 'wr_gray_nxt', and handle buffers with 'buf_avail' and 'buf_filled'. Data pointers such as 'wr_ptr', 'rd_ptr', and 'rd_ptr_tmp' facilitate read-write operations in queue. Module synchronization is achieved via 'RDSYNC' and 'WRSYNC', and status flags are monitored for full, empty, and almost full conditions."
