It is designed to store the input data (DataIn) when the write signal (Write) is high, and it outputs the stored data (DataOut). The width of the data is a parameterizable feature mentioned with parameter WIDTH. The module provides both synchronous reset (SyncReset) and asynchronous reset (Reset) which resets the data output (DataOut) to a predefined RESET_VALUE. The synchronous reset takes effect at the next positive edge of the clock if the SyncReset signal is high. As for the asynchronous reset (Reset), it takes effect immediately upon activation without needing to wait for the next clock edge."

When this signal is high, output data will get reset to the predefined RESET_VALUE on the next positive edge of the clock.\n\nOutput ports: DataOut. \nExplanation: \n- DataOut: This is the output data port which emits the data held by the register. The width of the output data is also defined by the parameter WIDTH. The data held by the register could be previous data or RESET_VALUE depending on the conditions addressed within the module."

It is a register that holds the value to be output. When a reset (either synchronous or asynchronous) is activated, this register is updated to hold the RESET_VALUE. When the Write signal is detected and no reset is pending, this register is updated to hold the value from the DataIn input port at the next clock edge. The DataOut register therefore acts as the memory element of this module, storing the value between clock cycles and reset events."
