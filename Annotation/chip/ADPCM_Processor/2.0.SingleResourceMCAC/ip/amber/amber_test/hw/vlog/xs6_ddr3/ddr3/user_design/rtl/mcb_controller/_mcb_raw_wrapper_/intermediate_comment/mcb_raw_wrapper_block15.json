    "block_comment": "This block is a configurable digital interface circuit for a memory controller bus. The circuits, instances of IODRP2_MCB module, manage the input-output interface of DRAM pins such as data(DQ), data strobe(DQS), data mask(LDM, UDM) with input delay, output delay and SERDES functionality. Each pin pair(DQ, DQS, UDM/LDM) has a master-slave pair of circuits with shared control signals, providing flexibility in SERDES modes. Each IODRP2_MCB instance is configured with parameters like data rate, delay values, memory controller bus address, SERDES mode and simulated tap delay value. The instances take in raw input data, clock signal, control signals, provide delayed data output, and also offer testability features. The block operates under a condition where 'C_NUM_DQ_PINS' equals 8, implying that it supports 8-bit wide memory interface."
