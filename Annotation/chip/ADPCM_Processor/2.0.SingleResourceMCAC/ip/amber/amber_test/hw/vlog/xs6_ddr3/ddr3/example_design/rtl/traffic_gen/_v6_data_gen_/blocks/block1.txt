Comment: 
This block of code acts as a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) data generator with support for eye testing. The `data_prbs_gen` module, instantiated in this `generate-if` framework, creates the PRBS pattern of a specified width and provides mechanisms to handle the initial seeds for generating the pattern. It works in sync with the input clock signal (`clk_i`) and can be reset using the reset input (`rst_i`). The clock enable entity (`data_clk_en`) controls the operation of the generator. The initial PRBS generation is seeded with the `prbs_fseed_i` and is controlled by the `prbs_seed_init` signal, typically a user command. The subsequent seeds are derived from various bits of `m_addr_i`. The PRBS generator outputs its pattern on `prbs_o` for further processing if the conditions `DGEN_PRBS` or `DGEN_ALL` are met.
