    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code generates pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) addresses for certain command patterns. When the command pattern matches either \"CGEN_PRBS\" or \"CGEN_ALL\", the `cmd_prbs_gen` module is instantiated with specific parameters like address width, seed width, etc. The module takes a clock input, a command clock enable signal, and a seed input while generating the PRBS output. It works by initiating the PRBS seed when the mode_load_pulse is high and generates the PRBS output with `cmd_seed_i` as the input seed."
