This block manages resetting and updating different instructions in a digital system using a synchronous design approach. Upon receiving a 'reset' signal, all stored and pre-fetch instructions, along with their associated properties like type, address and status, are reset to zero. However, on the other hand, if a 'clk' signal is received and the core is not stalled, the block updates 'saved_current_instruction'/'pre_fetch_instruction'/'hold_instruction' properties based on the conditions 'type == MTRANS' or 'saved_current_instruction_wen'/'pre_fetch_instruction_wen' respectively. This way, the block assures that instructions are both properly initialized and updated with the most recent ones when not in a 'reset' state.
