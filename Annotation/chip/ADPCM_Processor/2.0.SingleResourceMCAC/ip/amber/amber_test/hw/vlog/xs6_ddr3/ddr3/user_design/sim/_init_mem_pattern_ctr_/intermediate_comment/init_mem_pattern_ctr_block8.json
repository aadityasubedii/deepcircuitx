    "block_comment": "This block implements a synchronous reset functionality in a Finite State Machine (FSM). On the positive edge of the clock, it checks the reset signal. If the reset signal received is high, it sets the current_state of the FSM to its initial state ('5'b00001'). In the absence of a reset signal, it moves the FSM to the next_state, waiting for another clock tick for the transition."
