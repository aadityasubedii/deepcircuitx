    "block_comment": "This is a state machine implementation to control read and write operations. Depending on its current state (`READY`, `REFRESH_ST`, `READ`, `WRITE`, `CMD_WAIT`, etc), the block manages various signals, like `push_cmd`, `xfer_cmd`, `wdp_valid`, `rdp_valid` and `cmd_rdy` to handle read or write command transfers (\"xfer_cmd\"), the validity of write datapaths (\"wdp_valid\", \"wdp_validB\", \"wdp_validC\"), read datapaths (\"rdp_valid\"), whether a request can be made ready (\"cmd_rdy\") and the transition to next state (\"next_state\"). Conditions like readiness of the read or write datapaths, readiness of the command FIFO, and whether the current operation is reading, writing, or other command types are considered before transitioning from each state or executing commands. A fail-safe default state resets all signals and sets the next state to `READY`."
