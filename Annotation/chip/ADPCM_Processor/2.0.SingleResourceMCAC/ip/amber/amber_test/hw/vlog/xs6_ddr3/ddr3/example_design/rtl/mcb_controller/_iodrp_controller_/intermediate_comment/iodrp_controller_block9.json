    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for routing data from either the 'memcell_addr_reg' register or the 'data_reg' register to the 'data_out_mux' output. The routing decision is determined by the binary control signal 'addr_data_sel_n'. When 'addr_data_sel_n' is high (or 1), the data from 'memcell_addr_reg' is passed to 'data_out_mux'; otherwise, when 'addr_data_sel_n' is low (or 0), the data from 'data_reg' is selected and assigned to 'data_out_mux'. \nThis multiplexing functionality is implemented using the conditional operator (?) in Verilog."
