    "block_comment": "This block defines instantiation of a module named `a23_barrel_shift` which functions as a shift operation logic block in the CPU. It is designed to support both FPGA platforms and others, based on the pre-processor directive. It provides barrel shift functionality, taking in input data, a carry in flag, shift amount, a flag to indicate shift immediate as zero and shift function type, and outputs the result of the shifting operation along with carry out bit. It receives these inputs with the help of named port connections.-variable_templates-I would recommend preprocessing steps as follows:\n\n1. Variable & Line Cleanup: \n   Remove unnecessary characters and whitespace, condense multiple line statements into single line statements when \n   possible for better visibility. \n\n2. Pairing Inputs with Outputs:\n   When possible pair inputs and outputs together.\n\nHere is how sample Verilog code will look after preprocessing for machine learning model input:\n```\n<code>\n  a23_barrel_shift u_barrel_shift (\n    .i_in (input_data),\n    .i_carry_in (input_carry_in),\n    .i_shift_amount (shift_amt),\n    .i_shift_imm_zero (imm_zero_flag),\n    .i_function (shift_function),\n    .o_out (output_data),\n    .o_carry_out (output_carry_out)  \n   );\n</code>\n```\nThe associated comment/preprocessed output will be:\n```\n<comment>\n  The block is instantiating the a23_barrel_shift module which executes barrel shift operation in CPU context. Inputs are data, carry_in flag, shift amount, immediate zero flag, and the shift function. It outputs result of shift operation and a carry out bit. This supports both FPGA and non-FPGA platforms.\n</comment>\n```\n\nIn this approach, we use the cleaned code as the input to ML model and the associated comments as the output or labels during training period."
