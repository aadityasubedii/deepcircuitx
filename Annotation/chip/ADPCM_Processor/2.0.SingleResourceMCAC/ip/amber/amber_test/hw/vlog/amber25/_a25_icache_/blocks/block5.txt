Comment: 
This block of code is designed to detect multiple cache hits that exceed the accepted range. Working on every positive edge of the reset or the clock signals, the block checks if the sum of data hits in three different cache ways exceed '1'. If such a condition arises, it triggers a testbench error message and displays a warning that 'Hits in more than one cache ways!' have been detected. This is a form of runtime debug assertion to ensure that commands are being executed correctly and to guard against unexpected behaviors or conflicts linked with data cache accesses in diverse cache ways.
