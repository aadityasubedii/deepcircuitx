This block of code implements a function 'pick_way' designed for selecting a valid way based on a received set of valid bits and a random number. It examines the valid_bits vector, testing each bit individually. If a bit is not set (i.e., it is 0), it assigns the corresponding binary representation to pick_way. If all bits are set in valid_bits (i.e., no zeros in the valid_bits vector), it executes a case statement using the random_num as the selector to assign one of the eight possible values to pick_way. The bit positions for the values assigned to pick_way boost high the corresponding bit position signifying the chosen valid way.
