    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is for checking the timing of a data strobe signal. Specifically, it's designed to detect the negative edge of the data strobe signal (dqs_in) on channel 7. This is achieved using the 'always' block that gets executed whenever there's a falling (negative) pulse in the dqs_in[7] signal invoking the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function for channel 7."
