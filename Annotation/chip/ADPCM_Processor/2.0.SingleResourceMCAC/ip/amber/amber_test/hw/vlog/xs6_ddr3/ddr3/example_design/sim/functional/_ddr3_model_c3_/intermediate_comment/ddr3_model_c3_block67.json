    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for initiating a timing check on the 64th element (indexed from 0) of the 'dq_in' signal array whenever this element changes. It functions by saddling an 'always' block onto each change in the 64th element of the 'dq_in' array, which triggers the 'dq_timing_check' function for the 64th array element. This specific design ensures that the timing check is performed emanating from the most recent change in the 64th 'dq_in' signal."
