Module name: boot_mem32.

Module specification: The 'boot_mem32' module is a memory interface module designed to operate with the Wishbone bus protocol. This module facilitates 32-bit read and write operations for both debugging and normal modes. The interface is specified by the following inputs: 'i_wb_clk' for clock signal, 'i_wb_adr' for address signal, 'i_wb_sel' for selecting bytes, 'i_wb_we' for write operations, 'i_wb_dat' for input data, 'i_wb_cyc' for indicating a valid bus cycle, 'i_wb_stb' for the beginning of a data transfer cycle; and the following outputs: 'o_wb_dat' for the output data from read operations, 'o_wb_ack' for acknowledgment after cycle completion, 'o_wb_err' for error signal. Internal signals include 'start_write' to trigger write operations, 'start_read' to initiate read operations, 'jitter_r' for producing a jitter effect in debug mode, 'start_read_r' to track the read operation start status, 'read_data' for read data, 'write_data' for write data, 'byte_enable' to enable byte lanes for write operations, and 'address' for memory access point. The code consists of sections configuring for Xilinx FPGAs or other Generic FPGAs, debug mode or normal mode, and the inclusion of different versions of boot-loader memory instances based on parameter settings. The primary function of the module is to enable the system to perform memory operations.
