    "block_comment": "The Verilog code block serves to selectively map command fields of multiple enabled ports. The mapping functionality is determined by the port's enable signal (C_PORT_ENABLE[x]) and mode (C_Px_PORT_MODE). If a port is enabled and in \"RD_MODE\", the command fields (en', 'instr', 'addr', 'bl', and 'wr_en') of port 'P2' to 'P5' are assigned values from an enabled and 'WR_MODE' port in the order from 'P0' to 'P5'. If no such port exists, the command fields map to itself. Conversely, if a port is enabled and not in 'RD_MODE', i.e., in 'WR_MODE', it maps the command fields to itself directly. The order of port preference and hierarchy is managed thorough nested if-else statements."
