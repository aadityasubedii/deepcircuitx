    "block_comment": "This block of code checks if the constant 'C_MEM_TYPE' is set to \"DDR2\". If the equality condition is met, the code execution proceeds to the labeled block 'gen_cketrain_a'. All codes or statements that fall within this labeled block are processed. This condition can be used to enable or disable functionality, or select from a specific type of memory for operations like memory mapping, in this case for a DDR2 memory type. All the logic relevant to DDR2 would be encapsulated within this block."
