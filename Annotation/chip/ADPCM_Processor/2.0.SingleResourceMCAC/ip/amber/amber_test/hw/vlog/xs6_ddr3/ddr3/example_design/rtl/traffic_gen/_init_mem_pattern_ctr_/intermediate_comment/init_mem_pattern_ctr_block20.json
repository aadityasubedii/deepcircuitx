    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code serves as an address boundary checker for three sub-ranges. The block is activated on the positive edge of the input clock signal. It compares the current address with the end boundary address in three different ranges (29:24, 23:16, 15:8) and sets respective signals (AC3_G_E3, AC2_G_E2, AC1_G_E1) to '1' if the current address is greater or equal to the end boundary address in those specific ranges, otherwise, it sets the signals to '0'."
