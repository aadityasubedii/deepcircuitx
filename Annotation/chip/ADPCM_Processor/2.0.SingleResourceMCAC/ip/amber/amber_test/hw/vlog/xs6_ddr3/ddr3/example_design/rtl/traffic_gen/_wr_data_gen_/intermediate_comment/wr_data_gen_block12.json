    "block_comment": "This block of code is setting the value for `last_word_o`. It does this by performing a bitwise AND operation between `u_bcount_2` and `fifo_not_full`. This means the `last_word_o` signal will be high (1) only if both `u_bcount_2` and `fifo_not_full` signals are high (1). This can be interpreted as `last_word_o` being asserted when the buffer count is at a specific value (represented by `u_bcount_2`) and the FIFO buffer isn't full."
