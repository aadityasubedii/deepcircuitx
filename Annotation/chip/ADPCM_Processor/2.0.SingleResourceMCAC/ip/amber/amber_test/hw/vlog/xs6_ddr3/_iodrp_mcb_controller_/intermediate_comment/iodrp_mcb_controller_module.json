    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, \"iodrp_mcb_controller\", serves as a controller for the Data Reuse Protocol (DRP), enabling efficient memory read/write operations. It uses an internal Finite State Machine (FSM) to handle different operation states. Key data including memory address, read/write data, and control signals are stored in internal registers and updated in sync with the DRP_CLK clock signal. The module also includes a shift_n_expand task to manipulate data under specific conditions. All data and control signals are interfaced through well-defined input and output ports for seamless integration with other modules."
