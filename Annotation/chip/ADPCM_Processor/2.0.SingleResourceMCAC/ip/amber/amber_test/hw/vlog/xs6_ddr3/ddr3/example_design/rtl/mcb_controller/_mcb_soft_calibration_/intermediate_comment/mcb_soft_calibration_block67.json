    "block_comment": "The block controls the Self-Refresh mode of a hardware component on each rising edge of the user-interface clock (UI_CLK). If the reset signal (RST) is high, the Self-Refresh mode is turned off. However, whenever the mode register (SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE_R2) indicates that the Self-Refresh mode should be activated, the mode is turned on; any other time, such as when the system becomes adequately warm (WarmEnough), the mode is turned off. The self-refresh mode control is synchronized with the UI clock to ensure stable operation, especially during transitions in modes."
