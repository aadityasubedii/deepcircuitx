    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is used to check if there is a cache hit in an 8-way associative cache. If the condition \"WAYS == 8\" is satisfied, the block labelled \"check_hit_8ways\" is executed. This block consists of logic for comparing the input tag with the tags stored in each of the 8 cache ways. If a match is found, a cache hit is signalled, and the corresponding data from the matching cache way is fetched for further processing."
