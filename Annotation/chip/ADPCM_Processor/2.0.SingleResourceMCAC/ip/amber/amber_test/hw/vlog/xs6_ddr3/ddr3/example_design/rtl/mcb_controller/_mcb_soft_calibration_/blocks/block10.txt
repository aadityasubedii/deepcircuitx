This block of code primarily functions to increment a counter and assess a particular condition. It implements this functionality by enabling the counter 'counter_en' first. With the counter set to '1', the control enters a conditional check where 'count' is evaluated against a hard-coded value of '38'. If the 'count' variable is less than '38', the system state is assigned to 'WAIT9', essentially making the block repeat itself, thus facilitating the counter increment. Once 'count' reaches '38', the system state transitions to 'READ_MAX_VALUE'.
