    "block_comment": "This block of code is for monitoring a specific bit in the input data stream and initiating a timing check routine whenever it changes. It utilizes Verilog's `always` construct to continually observe the 23rd bit of the 'dq_in' input. A change in this bit triggers the `dq_timing_check()` function with '22' as its argument, which could serve for processing or validation of the data stream timing."
