    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional hardware interface generator for an AXI module in Verilog. If 'C_S0_AXI_ENABLE' is disabled, values are assigned facilitating operations like read and write, while ensuring communication on internal synchronization signals. However, if 'C_S0_AXI_ENABLE' is enabled, this block performs extra operations like data synchronization, AR and AW address allocation by masking with 'P_S0_AXI_ADDRMASK' among others. This block also instantiates 'axi_mcb_synch' and 'axi_mcb' modules, which are parameterized with design parameters like AXI data widths, read and write capabilities, and MCB interface attributes. This setup advocates for better control and flexibility."
