    "block_comment": "This Verilog block performs a triggering action based on changes in the 52nd bit of the data stream (dq_in[52]). When there are changes in this bit, it calls the dq_timing_check function with the argument 52, which essentially checks the timing related to the 52nd bit of the data stream."
