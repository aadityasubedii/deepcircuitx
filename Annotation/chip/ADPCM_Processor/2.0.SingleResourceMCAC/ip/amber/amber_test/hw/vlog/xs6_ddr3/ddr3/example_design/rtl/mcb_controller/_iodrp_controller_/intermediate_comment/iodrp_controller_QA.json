It takes a set of inputs including a memory cell address, write data, read/write command validity, and various control signals for broadcasting and synchronization. It processes these inputs in various phases driven by a Finite State Machine (FSM). The FSM manages the read/write operations and supports broadcasting. The module outputs read data, DRP control signals, and the ready or busy status of the system."
