Comment: 
This line of code is responsible for handling read strobe signals in a queue or buffer system. It uses a logical AND operation to ensure that the read strobe is only high (or 'true') when a read enable flag (`rd_en`) is set and the buffer or system is not empty (`!empty`). This approach ensures synchronization between read operations and availability of data in the system.
