    "block_comment": "The code block is a synchronous module, which resets or updates the value of TPauseRq signal based on given conditions. When a positive edge of either mtx_clk_pad_i (a clock signal) or wb_rst_i (reset signal) is detected, the conditional statement inside the block triggers. If a reset is detected (wb_rst_i is high), the TPauseRq signal is reset and is assigned the value of logic '0' after some propagation delay Tp. Otherwise, the TPauseRq takes up the value of the AND operation result between TxPauseRq_sync2 and inverse of TxPauseRq_sync3 after the same delay Tp."
