Comment: 
The code block functions as a flip-flop with an active high reset capability, specifically for synchronizing the `BlockingTxStatusWrite` signal to the `MTxClk` clock domain. Upon a rising edge of the `MTxClk` clock or a positive `Reset`, the flip-flop is activated. If the `Reset` signal is high, the `BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync3` bit will be reset to 0, effectively clearing the flip-flop. However, if the `Reset` is not asserted, `BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync3` follows the state of `BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync2`, therefore passing it through a clock domain crossing. The delay `#Tp` ensures tuning of the propagation delay for synchronization.
