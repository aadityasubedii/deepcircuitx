    "block_comment": "This block initiates a DQS (Data Strobe) odd receiver triggered on the rising edge (`posedge`) of the 15th element from the `dqs_odd` array. The function `dqs_odd_receiver` takes an index as an input and implements operations based on the state of the indexed DQS signal. This code is typically used in DDR memory interfaces where DQS signals are used for data transfer synchronization."
