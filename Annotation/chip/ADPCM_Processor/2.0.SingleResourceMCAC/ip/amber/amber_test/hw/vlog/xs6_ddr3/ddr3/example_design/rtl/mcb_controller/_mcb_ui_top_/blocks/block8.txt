Comment: 
This block of verilog code is primarily handling the connections or "wiring" for a memory control block in its AXI interface. These include signals for writing, reading and monitoring the memory bus status. In detail, the first section of signals handles the AXI write requests and responses, followed by signals to manage the AXI read requests, responses, and memory addressing. Lastly, the memory controller command instruction, enabling signals for writing, read/write status, and memory addressing are outlined.
