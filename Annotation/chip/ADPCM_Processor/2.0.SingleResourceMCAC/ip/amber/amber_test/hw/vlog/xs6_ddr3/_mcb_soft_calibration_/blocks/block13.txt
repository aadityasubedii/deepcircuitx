This block of code primarily handles the writing into memory cell in a memory controller. Code sets up the address and write data for the memory controller, switches it to write mode, and feeds it with a command to indicate it's valid for operation. Then it utilizes an 'if else' structure to determine the next state. If the memory controller indicates readiness (MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is high), it will move the state to UDQS_WRITE_NEG_INDELAY; otherwise, it transitions to the UDQS_WAIT2 state.
