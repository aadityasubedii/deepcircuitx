Module name: eth_registers. Module specification: This module implements the Ethernet controller's register block, handling various configuration and status registers for Ethernet operations. It has input ports for data (DataIn), address (Address), read/write control (Rw), chip select (Cs), clock (Clk), reset (Reset), and various control and status signals. Output ports include data output (DataOut), configuration settings (e.g., r_RecSmall, r_Pad, r_HugEn), timing parameters (e.g., r_IPGT, r_IPGR1, r_IPGR2), MAC address (r_MAC), and interrupt output (int_o). Internal signals include register selection signals (e.g., MODER_Sel, INT_SOURCE_Sel), write signals (e.g., MODER_Wr, INT_SOURCE_
