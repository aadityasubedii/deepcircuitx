    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of the 'wb_rdata32' to the 'o_wb_dat'. The assign statement indicates that the 'o_wb_dat' is continuously driven to the value of 'wb_rdata32'. Thus, any changes in 'wb_rdata32' will be instantly reflected in 'o_wb_dat'. This is a typical way to establish data routes or creating wire connections in Verilog code."
