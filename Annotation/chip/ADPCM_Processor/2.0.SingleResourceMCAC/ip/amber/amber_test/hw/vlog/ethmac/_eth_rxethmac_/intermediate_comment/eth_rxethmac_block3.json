    "block_comment": "The block generates the signal 'GenerateRxEndFrm', which indicates the end of receiving a frame in a communication protocol. This is achieved by logically ANDing the first bit of state data with a logical OR between the inverse of 'MRxDV', 'ByteCntGreat2', and 'ByteCntMaxFrame'. All of these boolean operations ensure 'GenerateRxEndFrm' properly reflects the specific condition that the frame is at its end."
