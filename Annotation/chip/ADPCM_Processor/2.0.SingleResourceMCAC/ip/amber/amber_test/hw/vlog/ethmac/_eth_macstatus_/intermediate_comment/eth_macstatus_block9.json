    "block_comment": "This block is essentially a state machine control logic for a receiver window in a communication system. It responds to positive edges of the MRxClk or the Reset. When a Reset condition occurs, the receiver collision window status, RxColWindow, is set to true. If there's a valid byte count without a collision happening and data is being received, the RxColWindow is set to false implying communication is in progress undisturbed. Finally, when the receiver state is idle, RxColWindow is reset, indicating the receiver is ready for new communication or to detect collisions."
