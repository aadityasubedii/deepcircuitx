The block of code is responsible for data address assignment. It achieves this by using 'assign' statements, where 'wr_addr_o' and 'rd_addr_o' output signals are wired to 'addr_i' input address, and 'rd_bl_o' is wired to 'bl_i'. This allows for both reading and writing to the same input address and setting of the bit length.
