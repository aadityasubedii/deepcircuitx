    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for splitting the output packet length into minimum and maximum frame length. Specifically, the upper 16 bits (31:16) of the output packet length are mapped to the minimum frame length (r_MinFL), while the lower 16 bits (15:0) are assigned to the maximum frame length (r_MaxFL). This is done using the `assign` keyword, which is used in continuous assignments in Verilog, to continuously drive the target (left-hand side) with the values of the source (right-hand side)."
