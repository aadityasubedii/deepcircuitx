Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a state machine that changes the value of the 'state_ascii' signal based on the current 'state'. The state machine operates in an `always` block that is sensitive to changes in the 'state' variable, setting 'state_ascii' to a string representing the current 'state' of the system. It covers different phases such as 'READY', 'DECIDE', 'ADDR_PHASE', and various 'ADDR_TO_DATA_GAP' states, 'DATA_PHASE', and 'ALMOST_READY'. The state machine is implemented using a case structure which conditionally assigns values to 'state_ascii' based on the 'state'.
