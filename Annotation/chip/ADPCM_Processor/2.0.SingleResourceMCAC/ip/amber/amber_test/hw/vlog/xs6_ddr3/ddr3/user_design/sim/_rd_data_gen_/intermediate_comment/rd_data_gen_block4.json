    "block_comment": "The provided block is responsible for controlling the 'data_valid' signal based on various conditions. At a rising edge of the clock, when the first bit of the reset input is high, the 'data_valid' signal is set to zero with a delay defined by the time constant queue (TCQ). If the user burst count is equal to 1 and the data port FIFO is ready, the 'data_valid' signal is set to zero (with a delay defined by TCQ). In either case where the user burst count is greater or equal to 1 or a command start signal is active, the 'data_valid' signal is set to 1 (with the delay defined by TCQ)."
