Comment: 
This block assigns values from memory stored in the array 'reg_ram_m' to individual registers. Verilog 'assign' statements are used to pass the values from each specific index of the 'reg_ram_m' array to corresponding register variables (r0 to r14, r13_svc, r14_svc, etc.). Additional outputs (r0_out to r14_out) are determined based on the 'reg_addr' function applied to 'mode_exec' and individual register indices.
