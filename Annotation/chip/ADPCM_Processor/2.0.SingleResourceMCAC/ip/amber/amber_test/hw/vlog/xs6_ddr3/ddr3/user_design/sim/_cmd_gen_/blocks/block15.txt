This block of code manages the force_rd_counts signal, which tracks read counts in synchronous design. Upon the rising edge of the clock (clk_i), it checks if the fifth bit of the reset input (rst_i[4]) is set. If set, it resets the force_rd_counts to 0 (using the delay model #TCQ to simulate the time delay). Otherwise, if the instruction is valid (instr_vld), it increments the read counts by one (again using the delay model #TCQ). Hence it acts as a counter with reset capability.
