Module-level comment: 
/*
* This module implements a testbench top-level for a memory controller, supporting up to 6 ports.
* It generates and controls test traffic for each enabled port, configuring parameters like data width,
* address range, and operation mode. The module instantiates traffic generators and memory controllers
* for each port, manages command and data signals, and provides error checking and status reporting.
* It uses configurable parameters to adapt to different port configurations and test scenarios.
