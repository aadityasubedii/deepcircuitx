This block enables a DQS (Data Strobe) receiver function whenever there is a rising edge (positive edge) on the 7th bit of the 'dqs_odd' bus. The function 'dqs_odd_receiver' is called corresponding to this triggering event and the bit index '6' is passed as the argument. This chunk of code is a fundamental part of data receiving mechanisms in memory interfaces utilizing DQS signals. The usage of edge-triggered hardware event displays a sample of synchronous design in Verilog RTL.
