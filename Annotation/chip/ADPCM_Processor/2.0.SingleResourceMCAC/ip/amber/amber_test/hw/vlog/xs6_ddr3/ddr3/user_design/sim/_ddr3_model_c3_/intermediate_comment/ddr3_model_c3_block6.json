    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for implementing a data timing check on the Negative Edge of the DQS line. It uses an always block scheduled on the positive edge of the 27th bit of 'dqs_in' bus to trigger the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function for the same bit index, thus ensuring that the timing check is responsive and accurate for each bit transition."
