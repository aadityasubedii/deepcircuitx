This block of code operates as a synchronizer for the self-refresh control signal with a provision for system reset. On every rising edge of the user-interface clock (ui_clk), if a system reset (sys_rst) is activated, the block initializes the three stages of synchronization to zero. If there is no reset, the signal selfrefresh_enter traverses through the synchronizer stages in each successive clock cycle, thereby establishing a chain of flip-flops to allow safe passage of the self-refresh signal from asynchronous to synchronous domain.
