    "block_comment": "It seems like you may have accidently not included the block of code you wanted me to comment on. Your example only includes closing statements of end and endgenerate which are typically used to close loops or conditional constructs in Verilog. Could you please provide the whole block of code that you need help with? Then I will be able to assist."
