    "module": "Module-level comment: The dumpvcd module generates Value Change Dump (VCD) files for post-simulation analysis and debugging. It lacks traditional I/O ports, yet interacts with design components via globally defined identifiers. It uses these identifiers to set parameters for VCD dump, including file name, start time, and duration. It also references specific signals from other modules for monitoring. An always block, triggered on positive clock edge, toggles VCD dumping and can terminate the test after completion. It operates when 'AMBER_DUMP_VCD' is defined."
