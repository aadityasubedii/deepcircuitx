    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to create a timing monitor on the 12th bit of the `dm_in` signal, ensuring that it complies with desired timing specifications. The functionality is provided by invoking the user-defined procedure `dm_timing_check` whenever the 12th bit of the `dm_in` signal changes, the procedure `dm_timing_check` takes the bit index `11` as input to specifically monitor the timing of this bit."
