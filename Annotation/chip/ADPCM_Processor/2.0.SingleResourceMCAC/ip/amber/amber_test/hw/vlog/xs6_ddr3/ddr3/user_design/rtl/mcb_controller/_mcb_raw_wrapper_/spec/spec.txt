Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface, handling interactions between user logic and DRAM memory. It supports various DRAM types (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, LPDDR) and configurations, managing address and data signals, command generation, and I/O operations. The module features numerous input ports for control signals, clocks, commands, and data, while output ports provide status information and memory interface signals. Key internal signals include clock and reset management, calibration logic, and data path control. The module is organized into sections for port configuration, address mapping, I/O logic, and memory interface generation. It incorporates IODRP2_MCB blocks for delay and calibration, OSERDES2 blocks for serialization, and various IOBUF instances for bidirectional signals. The wrapper supports different port
