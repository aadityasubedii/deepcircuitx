    "block_comment": "This block is an always block that triggers on the positive edge of the mtx_clk_i signal. The block has a state machine that incorporates several states: IDLE, WAIT, POLL, PREA, PREB, TX_0, TX_1, and CRC0. In the IDLE state, if md_bmcr_r[9] is true, it checks if wcount_r equals a specific constant, and if so, it migrates to the POLL state whilst resetting wcount_r. While in the WAIT state, it increments wcount_r, and transitions to the POLL state upon reaching a specific constant. The POLL state reads and stores package data from a file into memory, and if the data is new, it updates the necessary variables and transitions to the PREA state. In PREA and PREB states, it sends preambles while PREB state transitions to TX_0 state immediately. TX_0 and TX_1 states are for sending the packet content and these two states alternately run until the end of the packet. Lastly, the CRC0 state sends the inverted CRC checksum and transitions back to POLL state.\n"
