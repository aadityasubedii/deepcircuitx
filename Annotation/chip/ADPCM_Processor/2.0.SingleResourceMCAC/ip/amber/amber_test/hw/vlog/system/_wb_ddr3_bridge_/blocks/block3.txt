Comment: 
The block handles read and write operations on the wishbone bus interface. It listens for a positive edge clock signal, `i_clk`, and in case a `read_ack` is detected, it sets the `read_ready` signal. When a `start_read` is encountered, it clears the `read_ready` signal and holds the `start_read` until a `read_ack` is received. Concurrently, it also attains and stores the signals for `start_write`, `start_read`, and `wb_adr` for future querying. The block establishes a functionality to assign incoming data, `i_rd_data`, to the output data, `o_wb_dat`, based on the lower bits of the `i_wb_adr` signal address received. The specific bits to assign depend on whether it's a Virtex6 FPGA. Notably, the `read_ack` gets set when data is ready and reset otherwise.
