Comment: 
This block is used to directly assign the value of 'addr_counts' to 'seq_addr'. In terms of implementation, this operation is performed on a continuous basis by using the 'assign' keyword which indicates continual assignment in Verilog. It implies that every time the value of 'addr_counts' changes, that change will be immediately reflected in the 'seq_addr' value as well.
