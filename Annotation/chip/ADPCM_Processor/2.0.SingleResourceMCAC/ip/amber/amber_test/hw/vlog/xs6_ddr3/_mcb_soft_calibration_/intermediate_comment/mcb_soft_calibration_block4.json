    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a part of a state machine utilizing a counter and delay condition to implement the decrement state and recalibration start condition. It increments the counter (\"counter_dec\") and transitions it into decrement state until the \"DQS_DELAY\" is more than the lower limit and the counter reaches at least 4. When this happens, it enables the MCU UILDQSDEC and MCU UIUDQSDEC and reduces the delay by one. If delay goes beyond the lower limit, it shifts the state machine to decrement state. If neither of those conditions are met, the code defaults the system to the start of a dynamic calibration state."
