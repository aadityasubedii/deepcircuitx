This block of code is part of a finite state machine (FSM) handling different states of memory control bus (MCB) operations on write requests. The FSM transitions between three states: `LDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM`, `LDQS_CLK_N_TERM_WAIT`, and `LDQS_PIN_WRITE_P_TERM`. In the `LDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM` state, it moves either to `LDQS_CLK_N_TERM_WAIT` or `LDQS_PIN_WRITE_P_TERM` based on external inputs. In the `LDQS_CLK_N_TERM_WAIT` state, it waits for the MCB to be ready (`MCB_RDY_BUSY_N`), at which point it transfers to `LDQS_PIN_WRITE_P_TERM`. In this state, the memory cell address is loaded with `PTerm`, 'READ/WRITE' bit is set to Write Mode, and the value to be written (`P_Term_s`) is set up with 2 leading zeros.
