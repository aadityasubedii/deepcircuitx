    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily handles the management of state transitions in a state machine. The state machine has several states including READY, DECIDE, ADDR_PHASE, ADDR_TO_DATA_GAP1/2/3, DATA_PHASE, ALMOST_READY1/2/3, etc. The transitions between these states are determined through various condition checks and assignments within the 'case' statements. For every state, the block sets up 'load_shift_n' and 'nextstate' values based on the current 'state' and condition checks, such as 'cmd_valid, '&bit_cnt[2:0]', '`ALTERNATE_READ && rd_not_write_reg', etc., and make decisions on the next state. Also, the block defines the bit 'addr_data_sel_n' in the DECIDE and ADDR_PHASE states. Various states represent specific phases of operation and transition between states dictate the operational flow."
