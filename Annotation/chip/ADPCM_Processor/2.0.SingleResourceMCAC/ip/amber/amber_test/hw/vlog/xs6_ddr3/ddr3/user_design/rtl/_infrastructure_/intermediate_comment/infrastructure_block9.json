    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) with advanced features. The PLL is configured with specific parameters like clock period, division factor, phase, duty cycle, simulation device, internal compensation, division for feedback and reference jitter, which are passed as constants or signals to its instantiation. Two input clocks are supported, with selection specified by 'CLKINSEL' signal. This PLL implementation also allows for potential Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) operation as evidenced by DRP related signals (DADDR, DCLK, DEN, DI, and DWE). It generates multiple output clocks with varied frequencies and phases determined by their corresponding division factors and phases. The 'LOCKED' signal indicates when the PLL has achieved lock status."
