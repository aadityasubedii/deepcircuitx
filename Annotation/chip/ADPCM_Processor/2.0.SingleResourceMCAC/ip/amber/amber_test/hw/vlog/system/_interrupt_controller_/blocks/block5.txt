Comment: 
The specific block assigns raw interrupt requests from various hardware units to a single multi-bit wire, `raw_interrupts`. It consolidates interrupt inputs from different units: ETHMAC, three Timer Modules (tm_timer) and two UART modules. Two bit-positions are explicitly idle with '0' assignments. These inputs are put together into a 25-bit wide wire with unused interrupt wires set to '0'.
