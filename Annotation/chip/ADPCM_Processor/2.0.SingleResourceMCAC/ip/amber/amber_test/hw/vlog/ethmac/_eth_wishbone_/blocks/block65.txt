Comment: 
This block of code is primarily used for signal synchronization and hold control. It is triggered either by the positive edge of the Write Back clock (WB_CLK_I) or by the positive edge of the Reset signal. When a Reset is sensed, the write back transaction abort signal (TxAbort_wb) is set as low indicating the abortion of the ongoing transaction. If no Reset input is detected, the TxAbort_wb signal takes the value of the first synchronous signal (TxAbortSync1), ensuring a smooth transaction if there's no need for reset.
