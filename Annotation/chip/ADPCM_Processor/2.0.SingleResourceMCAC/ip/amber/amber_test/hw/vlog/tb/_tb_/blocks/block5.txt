Comment: 
This line of code assigns the value of the `test_status_reg` register from the `U_TEST_MODULE` module to the `test_status_reg` in the current module. It performs a signal assignment operation, where the signal `test_status_reg` of the module under test `U_TEST_MODULE` is directly assigned to the local `test_status_reg` signal. Depending on the size of `test_status_reg`, the assignment might act like a wire connecting two points (if it's a single bit) or as a bus (if it's multi-bits).
