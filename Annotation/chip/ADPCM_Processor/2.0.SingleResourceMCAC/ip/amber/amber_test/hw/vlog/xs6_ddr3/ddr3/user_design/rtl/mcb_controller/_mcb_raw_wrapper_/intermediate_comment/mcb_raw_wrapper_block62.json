    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block selectively configures a 32-bit read operation. The configuration is implemented using if-else conditional structure: when a port is enabled and the settings for port configuration are \"B32\" for bits 183:160 and \"R32\" for bits 55:32, then the register values and clock settings are assigned to respective variables, effectively setting up a 32-bit read operation. If these conditions are not fulfilled, all respective variables are set to zero, disabling the port."
