    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles address checking in a network device. Upon every positive edge of the MRxClk or Reset signals, the code either resets the AddressMiss signal if a Reset event is detected or updates the AddressMiss signal based on the result of a complex logical operation. This operation checks if the received address is unicast, broadcast, multicast, or a control frame that should pass anyway (when PassAll and ControlFrmAddressOK are both high). If none of these conditions are true, the AddressMiss signal is set to display an address miss."
