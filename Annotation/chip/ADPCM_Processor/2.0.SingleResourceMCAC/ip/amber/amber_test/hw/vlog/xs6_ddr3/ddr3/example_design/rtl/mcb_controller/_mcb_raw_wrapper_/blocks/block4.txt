Comment: 
The Verilog block facilitates memory interfacing by handling data-strobe signals based on memory type and pin count. By dynamically generating the appropriate input and output buffers (IOBUF or IOBUFDS), this block either controls a uni-directional or differential data-strobe. If the memory type is "DDR","MDDR" or "DDR2" with 'DIFF_DQS_EN' set to "NO", and the number of data (DQ) pins is 16, a uni-directional data-strobe buffer (IOBUF) is instantiated, else a differential data-strobe buffer (IOBUFDS) is utilized, assuming the DQ pins count is 16.
