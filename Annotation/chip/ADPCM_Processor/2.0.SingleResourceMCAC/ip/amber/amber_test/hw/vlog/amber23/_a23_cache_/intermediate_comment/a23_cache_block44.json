    "block_comment": "This block of code performs selective data manipulation based on the value of the address bits. It generates the write data for a read miss event in a memory system. The write data is created from a burst read data (wb_rdata_burst) based on 2 selected bits (3rd and 2nd bit) of the miss_address. Specifically, when the 3rd and 2nd bits of the miss address are '00', '01', '10', or '11', different sections of the wb_rdata_burst are concatenated to form the write data."
