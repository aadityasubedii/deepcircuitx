    "block_comment": "This block of code is handling the assignment of interrupt priorities in a Verilog-based hardware design. It performs this by using the conditional (ternary) operator to check different requests in a pre-defined order of importance, replacing the long series of if-else statements. If a data abort (dabt) request is made (`dabt_request`), it is given the highest priority and `next_interrupt` is assigned the value `3'd1`. This is followed by the fast and normal interrupt requests, `firq_request` and `irq_request`, respectively, with their own unique priority values. Then `instruction_adex` and `instruction_iabt` are checked. If no other requests are made, the process then checks for an undefined (`und_request`) and software interrupts (`swi_request`) in that order. Finally, if none of these conditions are met, `next_interrupt` is set to `3'd0`, implying no interrupt request has been made."
