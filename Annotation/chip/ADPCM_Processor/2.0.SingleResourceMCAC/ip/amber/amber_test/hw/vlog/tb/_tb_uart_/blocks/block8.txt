Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for transmitting data and managing FIFO pointers in a transmitting FIFO buffer. The first line sets the `tx_bit_start` signal to true when the `tx_bit_count` equals zero indicating that the transmission of a new bit can start. The next line compares the write pointer (`txfifo_wp`) and the read pointer (`txfifo_rp`) of the transmitting FIFO buffer, and assigns the result to `txfifo_empty`. If the write pointer equals the read pointer, it implies the FIFO is empty, hence `txfifo_empty` is set to true indicating there is no data in the FIFO buffer for transmission.
