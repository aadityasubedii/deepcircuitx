This Verilog block implements a task named `branch_args` that manipulates the value of a register based on the 24th bit of an executed instruction. If the 24th bit of the executed instruction is '1', it assigns 'shift_amount' as a bitwise negation of the first 24 bits and adding one, followed by two trailing '0' bits. If the 24th bit isn't '1', it simply assigns 'shift_amount' as bits [23:0] followed by two '0' bits. Depending on the 24th bit of the instruction, it then writes to 'decompile_file', either decreasing or increasing the 21st register value by 'shift_amount', in a hexadecimal format with leading '0's removed.
