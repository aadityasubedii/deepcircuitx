    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the gated PLL lock signal, selecting its source based on the condition of the 'normal operation window'. If 'normal operation window' is true, 'gated_pll_lock' directly adopts the 'pll_lock' value. Otherwise, it defaults to 'syn_uiclk_pll_lock'. This ensures a smooth transition between different PLL lock signals under different operation windows."
