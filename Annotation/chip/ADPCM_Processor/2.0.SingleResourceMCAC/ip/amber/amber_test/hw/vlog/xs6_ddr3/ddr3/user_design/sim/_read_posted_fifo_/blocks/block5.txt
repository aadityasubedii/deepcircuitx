Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for computing the buffer availability at positive edge clock events. It calculates the buffer availability by subtracting the difference between the requested read data counts (rd_data_counts_asked) and the received read data counts (rd_data_received_counts) from 64. The computed buffer availability is then assigned to the buf_avail_r signal, on every positive clock edge. This process is done with a delay specified by the #TCQ constant.
