This block of Verilog RTL code is used to create a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) generator. Primarily, it's used when the CMD_PATTERN matches either "CGEN_PRBS" or "CGEN_ALL". Configurable parameters, such as the test cycle (TCQ), FAMILY, address width, data width, PRBS width, seed width, end and start address positions and values, are passed as part of the module instance declaration. Subsequently, instances of this module are created that generate addresses fetched from this sequence, based on a seed value (cmd_seed_i[31:0]), a clock signal (clk_i), and an enable signal (cmd_clk_en). The output of this module (prbs_addr) is a pseudo-random byte stream.
