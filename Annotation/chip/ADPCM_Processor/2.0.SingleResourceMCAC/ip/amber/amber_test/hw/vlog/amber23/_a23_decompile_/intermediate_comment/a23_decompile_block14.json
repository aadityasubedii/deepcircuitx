    "block_comment": "The Verilog RTL code block implements a task named swap_args. The function of this block is to execute a sequence of operations for swapping arguments between warm registers. The task warms up three different registers labelled reg_d, reg_m, and reg_n respectively. The warming up operation is followed by writing into the decompile_file via the $fwrite system function. The contents of the write operation are comma-separated values and an enclosing bracket for the third register or operand. In essence, the block achieves its function by invoking warmth on each register and then consecutively writing register values into the decompile_file."
