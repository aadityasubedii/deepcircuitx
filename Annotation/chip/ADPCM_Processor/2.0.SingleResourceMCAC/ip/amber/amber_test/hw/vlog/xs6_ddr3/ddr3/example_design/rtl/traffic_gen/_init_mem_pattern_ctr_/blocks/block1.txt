This block manages different states related to memory interaction. Initially, `load_seed_o` is set to `0`. A set of conditions then define `addr_mode`, `instr_mode_o`, `bl_mode_o` and `fixed_bl_o` based on command patterns, mode enablement, and platform family. If in `RD_MODE`, `fixed_instr_o` is set to `RD_INSTR` value and similarly for `WR_MODE` and `BI_MODE`. The main component is a case switch for different states: `IDLE`, `INIT_MEM_WRITE, `INIT_MEM_READ`, `TEST_MEM`, and `CMP_ERROR`. Depending on the current state and conditions fulfilled, the system may transition to another state for memory tests or remain idle with certain modes and patterns activated. Modes `mode_load_o`, `run_traffic`, `load_seed_o`, `fixed_instr_o`, `addr_mode`, `instr_mode_o` and `bl_mode_o` are manipulated in different states to control traffic run, sequence of memory write and read and handle error scenarios. By manipulating these variables based on circumstances, the system adapts its behavior for memory operations.
