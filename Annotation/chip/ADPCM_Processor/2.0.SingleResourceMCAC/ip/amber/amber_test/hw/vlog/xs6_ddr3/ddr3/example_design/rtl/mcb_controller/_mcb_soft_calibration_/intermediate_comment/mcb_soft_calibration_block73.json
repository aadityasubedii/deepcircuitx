    "block_comment": "This block acts as a system reset counter during dynamic calibration process. When the system state equals 'START_DYN_CAL_PRE', the 'pre_sysrst_cnt' counter increments at each positive edge of the user interface clock (UI_CLK), forming a system reset count. If the state is any other, it resets 'pre_sysrst_cnt' to zero. This block effectively implements a conditional counting mechanism."
