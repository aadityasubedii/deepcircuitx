    "block_comment": "This block functions as a DQS (Data Strobe) signal receiver in a digital system, particularly reacting to the positive edge of the `dqs_odd[9]` signal. Upon detection of this rising edge event, it calls the `dqs_odd_receiver` function with '9' as a parameter. Hence, it's a critical part of a DDR (Double Data Rate) interface, ensuring data integrity by providing the timing reference for the data lines involved in communication."
