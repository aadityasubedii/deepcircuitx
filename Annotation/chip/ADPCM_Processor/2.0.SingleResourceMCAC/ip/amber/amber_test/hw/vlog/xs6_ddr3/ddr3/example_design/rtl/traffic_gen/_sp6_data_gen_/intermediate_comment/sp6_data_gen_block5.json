    "block_comment": "This logic block handles a reset operation or the assignment of values to a variable 'hdata', under certain conditions. Initially, upon receiving a positive edge of 'clk_i', if a reset signal 'rst_i' is detected, 'hdata' will be reset to 'd0. Next, the subsequent else-if condition checks for either the 'fifo_rdy_i' signal and non-zero 'user_burst_cnt' value, or the 'cmd_startC' signal to assign 'hdata'. Depending on the value of 'NUM_DQ_PINS', 'hdata' is assigned with varying hexadecimal values using the delay mechanism, represented by '#TCQ'. The assignment is uniquely designed for 'NUM_DQ_PINS' being 16, 8 and 4."
