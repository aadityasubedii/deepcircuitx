    "block_comment": "The block of code serves the purpose of managing byte counter during the transmission process (TxByteCnt). The control is initiated at the positive edge of the MTxClk or when reset. On initiation, if a reset or a TxAbort_q or TxRetry_q flag is detected, the byte counter is reset to zero. If a frame starts with unused data, the counter changes based on the TxPointerLSB. It follows a specific sequence (0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3 then back to 0). If data is used and Flop is active, TxByteCnt increments by one."
