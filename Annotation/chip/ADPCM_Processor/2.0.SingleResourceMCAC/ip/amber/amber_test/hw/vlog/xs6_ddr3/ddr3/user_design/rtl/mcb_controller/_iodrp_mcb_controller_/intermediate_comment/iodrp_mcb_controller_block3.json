    "block_comment": "This block is for assigning the value to the DRP_SDI line based on some conditions. It works by using a ternary operator which checks three conditions - the rd_not_write_reg and the DRP_CS should be high, and the DRP_ADD should be low. If all these conditions are met, the value of DRP_SDO is assigned to DRP_SDI, else the last DRP_SDI_pre value is kept as it is."
