Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for refreshing and updating the value of `RetryCntLatched`. Implemented as a synchronous module, it is clocked on the positive edge of `MTxClk` or on the assertion of the `Reset` signal. If the `Reset` signal is high, it resets the value of `RetryCntLatched` to 0. If either `StartTxDone` or `StartTxAbort` is true, `RetryCntLatched` is then latched with the current value of `RetryCnt`.
