    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for triggering a timing check function when there is a negative edge detected on the DQS (data-strobe) signal at the 10th bit position. To achieve this, the code uses an 'always' block, which triggers at every negative edge of the 10th bit of the `dqs_in` signal (which is a type of sensitive list). As a result, the `dqs_neg_timing_check` function with '9' as an argument is called whenever the 10th bit of the `dqs_in` value goes from HIGH to LOW."
