This block of code implements a boundary check within a memory space. Leveraging clock cycles, it compares the current address's least significant bits with the end boundary address's least significant bits. If the current address equals or surpasses the end boundary address, then it sets the lower_end_matched to true, indicating that the end of the boundary has been reached. If not, it sets the lower_end_matched to false, indicating that the end of the boundary has not yet been reached.
