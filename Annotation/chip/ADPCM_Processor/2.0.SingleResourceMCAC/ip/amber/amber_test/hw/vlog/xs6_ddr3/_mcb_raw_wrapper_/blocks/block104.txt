This block is managing a specific state within a synchronous UI clock (ui_clk) cycle. The conditional check ensures the update of a flag (syn_uiclk_pll_lock) only when the system is not going to refresh or currently in self-refresh mode. It uses the "posedge" keyword to ensure this operation occurs at each rising edge of the UI clock signal. The flag (syn_uiclk_pll_lock) is set based on the current locking state of the PLL (Phase-Locked Loop; pll_lock), which indicates whether the PLL has achieved or maintained the desired phase and frequency.
