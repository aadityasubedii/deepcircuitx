    "block_comment": "This block implements the I/O interface for a 16-bit wide memory data bus in a memory controller. It instantiates IODRP2_MCB (I/O Digital Reconfigurable Port) modules for each data bit (DQ0-DQ15), data strobe signals (DQS/DQSN), and data mask signals (UDM/LDM). The IODRP2_MCB modules handle input/output operations, including delay adjustments and serialization/deserialization. The implementation uses a master-slave configuration for pairs of bits, with interconnected auxiliary scan chains for configuration. The block allows for individual tap delay settings for each DQ line and DQS signal to fine-tune the interface timing."
