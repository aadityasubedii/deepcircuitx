Comment: 
This Verilog block describes the reset and operational behavior of two signals, `WCtrlDataStart` and `RStatStart`. The triggers for this block are a positive edge of the `Clk` (clock) signal or a positive edge of `Reset` signal. If a reset is detected, it synchronizes the `WCtrlDataStart`, `WCtrlDataStart_q`, and `RStatStart` signals to a low state. During normal operation, if `EndBusy` is high, `WCtrlDataStart` and `RStatStart` are reset, otherwise, they are assigned based on conditions of related signals. Also, the current state of `WCtrlDataStart` is stored in `WCtrlDataStart_q` at each clock cycle.
