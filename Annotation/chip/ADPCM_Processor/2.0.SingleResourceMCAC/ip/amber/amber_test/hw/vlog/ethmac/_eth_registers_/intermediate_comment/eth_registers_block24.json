    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the triggering of the transmit complete interrupt (TC IRQ) in a digital signal processor. It's triggered on the rising edge of either the transmission clock (TxClk) or the system reset signal (Reset). When the reset signal is high, the TC IRQ is cleared immediately. If a transmission control frame has finished and transmission start is asserted, along with the transmission flow control signal being high, the TC IRQ signal is set. If the interrupt reset is called (ResetTxCIrq_sync2), the TC IRQ signal is again cleared. Overall, this block's function is to manage TC IRQ based on system state change and signal processing flow."
