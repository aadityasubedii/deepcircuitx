    "block_comment": "This block is a flip-flop that latches the cmd_clk_en signal. On every positive edge of the clock signal (clk_i), the status of the cmd_clk_en signal, after a delay equivalent to TCQ, is assigned to cmd_vld, hence synchronizing the cmd_clk_en to clk_i, and adding a delay of TCQ to the output."
