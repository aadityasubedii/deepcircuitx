    "block_comment": "This block is a clock-driven state machine dealing with read data processing in a delay-based data pipeline. It either resets or updates the 'read_data_filtered_r' and 'load_rd_r' registers. On a positive edge of the 'reset' signal, it resets these two registers with zero. On the other side, at the positive edge of the clock 'clk', if there is valid incoming read data ('i_wb_read_data_valid' is 1), it updates the 'read_data_filtered_r' with the filtered read data and 'load_rd_r' by concatenating 5th to 6th bits and 0th to 3rd bit of 'i_wb_load_rd'."
