This block is responsible for updating the status of the 'RxStatusWriteLatched' register based on the system's state. Upon a rising edge detection of either 'WB_CLK_I' or 'Reset', this register is modified. If a 'Reset' condition is detected, then 'RxStatusWriteLatched' is set to 0. If 'RxStatusWriteLatched_syncb2' condition is detected, 'RxStatusWriteLatched' is also set to 0. Lastly, if 'RxStatusWrite' condition is detected, 'RxStatusWriteLatched' is set to 1.
