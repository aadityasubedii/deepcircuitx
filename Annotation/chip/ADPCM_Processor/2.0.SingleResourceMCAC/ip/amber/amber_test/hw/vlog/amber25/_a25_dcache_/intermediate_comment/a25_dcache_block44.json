    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is designed to handle situations where data needs to be written into a memory array consecutively. It leverages the concept of ternary operators to assign different segments of 'consecutive_write_wdata' based on the value of the third and fourth least significant bits of the 'i_address' input. If these two bits are '00', '01', '10', or anything else, different portions of the 'data_wdata_r' input and 'con_write_data_word' are concatenated to form the output. This allows for a dynamic and efficient way to handle data distribution during the process of consecutive memory writing."
