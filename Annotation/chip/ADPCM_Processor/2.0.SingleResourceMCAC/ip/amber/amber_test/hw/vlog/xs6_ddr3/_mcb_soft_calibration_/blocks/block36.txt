The given block of code is responsible for writing Normal Termination (NTerm) values into memory cell in a write mode. It accomplishes this function by assigning the NTerm values to the address of the IODRPCTRLR memory cell and setting the read/write bit (R_WB) to write mode. Additionally, it writes a concatenated 1-bit zero with N_Term_s into the write data register. It also assigns IOI_LDQS_CLK to MCB_UIADDR and sets the MCB_CMD_VALID to 1. Conditional check for a busy/ready bit (MCB_RDY_BUSY_N) is then performed, and depending upon its value, it determines the state of the machine to be the same as 'LDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM'.
