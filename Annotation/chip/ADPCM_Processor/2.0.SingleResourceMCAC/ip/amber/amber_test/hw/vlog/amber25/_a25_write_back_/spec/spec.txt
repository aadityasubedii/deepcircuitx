Module name: a25_write_back.

Module specification: The "a25_write_back" module is a critical component in the data flow process. It's primary functionality lies in temporarily storing memory read data, read data validity, and load register values, allowing these values to be accessed externally in a controlled and synchronized manner. The module is controlled by the following input ports: clk, reset, scan_enable, test_mode, i_mem_stall, i_mem_read_data, i_mem_read_data_valid, i_mem_load_rd, i_daddress, and i_daddress_valid. 'clk' is the clock signal used for synchronization, 'reset' initializes the register values, 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' are used for testing purposes, 'i_mem_stall' stalls the system, 'i_mem_read_data' is the memory data input, 'i_mem_read_data_valid' validates the read data, 'i_mem_load_rd' specifies the load register and 'i_daddress' and 'i_daddress_valid' are used for receiving the data address. The module outputs data through the following ports: o_wb_read_data, o_wb_read_data_valid, and o_wb_load_rd, each corresponding to memory read data, read data validity, and load register. Internally, it employs four registers mem_read_data_r, mem_read_data_valid_r, mem_load_rd_r, and daddress_r to hold and process input information. The code structure comprises of conditional always blocks which manages the module's functionality according to input signals.
