Comment: 
This block triggers a function which is likely defined elsewhere in the code named "dqs_odd_receiver" whenever there's a positive edge on the third index of the "dqs_odd" array signal. This implies its function is to synchronize actions based on the positive transitions of a specific signal line. The "always @" block is a common Verilog pattern for capturing the fact that certain actions are event-driven, in this case, the event is the positive edge of "dqs_odd[3]".
