    "block_comment": "The provided block is a synchronous resettable error checking block. At every positive edge of the clock, if reset or manual_clear_error is triggered, the error_byte_r1 and data_error are set to 0. Otherwise, these two variables are updated with the latest detected error_byte state and the OR logic output of the previous error_byte_r1 states. Additionally, if data_error happens, the system displays an error message with detailed information including expected data, received data, and the time of the error occurring."
