    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a task that sets the latency for read and write operations in the memory system. The task first checks the value of the Additive Latency (al). If it is zero, then the Additive Latency is set to zero. Otherwise, it's set to the difference between the CAS Latency and the Additive Latency (al). Next, the read and write latencies are set by adding the CAS Latency and the CAS Write Latency to the Additive Latency respectively."
