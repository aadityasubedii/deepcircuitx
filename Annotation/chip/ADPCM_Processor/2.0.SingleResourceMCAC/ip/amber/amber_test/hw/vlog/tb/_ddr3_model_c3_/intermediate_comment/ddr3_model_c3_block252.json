    "block_comment": "This block is initializing a string array `cmd_string[]` with mnemonic representations for various command modes in a memory controller context. It uses predefined constant indices such as `LOAD_MODE`, `REFRESH`, `PRECHARGE`, etc. to assign the respective string values. Each string represents a specific memory operation command, providing a human-readable mapping for these command types."
