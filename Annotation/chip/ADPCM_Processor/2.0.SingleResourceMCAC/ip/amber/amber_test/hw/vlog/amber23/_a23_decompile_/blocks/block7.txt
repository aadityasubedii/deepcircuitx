Comment: 
This block of Verilog code represents a task that writes a 32-bit number to a file in hexadecimal format, with leading zeros omitted. The task checks the input number in descending 4-bit (nibble) sections, and writes the number starting from the first non-zero nibble found. This results in a hexadecimal number written to the file with no leading zeros.
