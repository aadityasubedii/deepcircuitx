    "block_comment": "This block of code represents instantiation of the 'eth_crc' module with the tag 'txcrc'. It is responsible for Ethernet cyclic redundancy check (CRC) in the transmission process. It utilizes inputs such as data 'Data_Crc', 'MTxClk' as clock, 'Reset' for initial state, 'Enable_Crc' for enabling the CRC generation, 'Initialize_Crc' for initial setup, while outputting 'Crc' as the CRC code result and 'CrcError', indicating a CRC error if detected."
