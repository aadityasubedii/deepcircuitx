This block updates the 'read_data' register either on synchronous reset or certain state of the FSM. In case of a synchronous reset (`sync_rst` is high), the block resets 'read_data' to 0; this is achieved by setting register `read_data` to '8'h00' at the positive edge of `DRP_CLK`. However, if the system has not been reset, and the FSM is in the `ALMOST_READY` state, the block assigns the value of `shift_through_reg` to `read_data` at the positive edge of `DRP_CLK`.
