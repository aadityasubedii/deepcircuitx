    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code manages data handling, conditional reading, and comparison operations based on the FPGA family and memory burst length. The block assigns values to \"rd_mdata_o\", \"cmp_data_valid\", \"cmp_data_o\", \"cmp_addr_o\", \"cmp_bl_o\" and \"data_rdy_o\" based on differing conditions. For \"FAMILY == SPARTAN6\", \"rd_mdata\" and \"cmp_data_valid\" are assigned the values of \"rd_data_r3\" and \"cmp_data_en\" respectively. When the family is \"VIRTEX6\" and memory burst length equals 4, \"rd_mdata\" and \"cmp_data_valid\" are assigned \"rd_v6_mdata_r2\" and \"v6_data_cmp_valid\" respectively. The \"data_rdy_o\" is set based on the conjunction of \"cmp_valid\" and \"data_valid_i\". The \"cmp_addr_o\" and \"cmp_bl_o\" are assigned the values of \"gen_addr\" and \"gen_bl\" respectively."
