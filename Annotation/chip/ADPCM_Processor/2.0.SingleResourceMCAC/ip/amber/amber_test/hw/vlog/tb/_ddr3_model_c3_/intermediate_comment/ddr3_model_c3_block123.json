    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is implementing an 'always' block that is triggered whenever there's any change in the 8th bit (with index 7) of the input signal 'dq_in'. When a change is detected, the function 'dq_timing_check' is called with the argument '7'. The function 'dq_timing_check' is not defined within this block, so this block alone may be a part of a larger RTL module or design hierarchy. The purpose of the block is to perform timing checks on the specific bit of input, possibly in context of a digital communications system or for debugging purposes."
