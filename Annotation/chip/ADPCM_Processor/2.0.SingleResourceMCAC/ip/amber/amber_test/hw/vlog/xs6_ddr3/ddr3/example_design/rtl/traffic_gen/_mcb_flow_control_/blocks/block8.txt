Comment: 
This block of code is a flip-flop circuit for register updates on a positive edge of the input clock signal. Within this always block, the push_cmd signal is assigned to the push_cmd_r register following a delay of TCQ time units which represents the clock quality time. This delay would allow the push_cmd signal to properly synchronize with the clock cycle. It's crucial in digital synchronous circuits to ensure no undesirable effects such as glitches or race conditions.
