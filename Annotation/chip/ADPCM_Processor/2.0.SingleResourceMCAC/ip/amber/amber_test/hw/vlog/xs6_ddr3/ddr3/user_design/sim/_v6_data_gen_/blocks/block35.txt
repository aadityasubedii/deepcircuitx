The block of code generates a specific data pattern for a device with 96 Data Quantity (NUM_DQ_PINS) pins. The type of data pattern generated is determined by the variable DATA_PATTERN, which can take the values "DGEN_NEIGHBOR", "DGEN_WALKING1", "DGEN_WALKING0", or "DGEN_ALL". The generation of the data pattern is synced with the rising edges of the input clock signal (clk_i).
