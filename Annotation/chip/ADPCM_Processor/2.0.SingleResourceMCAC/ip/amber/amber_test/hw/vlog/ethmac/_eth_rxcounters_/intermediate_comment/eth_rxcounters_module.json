    "module": "Module-level comment: \nThe eth_rxcounters module counts characteristics of received data frames within an Ethernet system. It uses input signals to track byte counts, monitor Inter-Frame-Gaps (IFG), and implement Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC). The block logic handles counters reset and increment process, manages a delay mechanism for CRC, and gives outputs based on certain conditions like byte count or IFG reaching predetermined values. This module provides crucial statistics for the Ethernet network's operation and control."
