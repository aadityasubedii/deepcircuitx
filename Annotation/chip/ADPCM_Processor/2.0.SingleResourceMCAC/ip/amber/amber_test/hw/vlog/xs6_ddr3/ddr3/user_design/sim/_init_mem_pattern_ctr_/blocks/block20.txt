Comment: 
This block of verilog code determines whether certain portions of `current_address` are larger than or equal to the corresponding bits in `end_boundary_addr`. When the `clk_i` has a positive edge, the code compares 3 sets of bit segments (bit 29 to 24, bit 23 to 16, bit 15 to 8) from the `current_address` and `end_boundary_addr`. If any corresponding segment from `current_address` is greater than or equal to the one from `end_boundary_addr`, the code assigns a binary high (`1'b1`) to the respective flag (`AC3_G_E3`, `AC2_G_E2`, `AC1_G_E1`); otherwise, a binary low (`1'b0`) is assigned.
