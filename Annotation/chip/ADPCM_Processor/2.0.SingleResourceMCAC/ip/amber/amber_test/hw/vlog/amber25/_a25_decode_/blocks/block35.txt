Comment: 
This line of RTL Verilog code is performing an assignment operation, serving to forward the status of the 'conflict' signal to the output 'o_conflict'. This is accomplished using the Verilog 'assign' statement, which allows for continuous assignment that transfers the value from the right side to the left when the value on the right changes, making 'o_conflict' effectively a wire driven by the value of 'conflict'.
