Module name: eth_spram_256x32.
Module specification: 

The eth_spram_256x32 module serves as a controller for a single port RAM with byte-enable capability. Its architecture provides 256 memory addresses, each storing a 32-bit data. 

The module is controlled by several input ports: 
- 'clk' is the clock signal that coordinates the timing of all operations.
- 'rst' is the reset signal which, when set, resets the module to its initial state.
- 'ce' (chip enable signal) activates operations in the module.
- 'we' (write enable signals) is a vector indicating which bytes are to be written.
- 'oe' (output enable signal) activates the output to be read.
- 'addr' serves as an 8-bit address port specifying memory locations for read/write operations.
- 'di' is the data input port of 32 bits for write operations.

The module generates a 32-bit output through the 'do' data output port.

An internal signal, 'write_enable' undergoes logical operations, being the 'logical and' of 'ce' and the reduction 'or' of 'we'. It signals a write operation when 'ce' is high and at least one bit of 'we' is high.

The module incorporates different types of FPGA designs - Xilinx Spartan6, Virtex6, and a generic one. The kind of FPGA is determined by the defined parameter.

The module's design and functionality offer an efficient and reliable management of memory addresses in hardware design applications.
