    "block_comment": "The given block designs a control state machine for a data storage system interfacing with Writeback (WbEn), Receiver (RxEn), and Transmitter (TxEn) modules, operating on the rising edge of Writeback clock or a reset signal. When reset, it initializes all control signals and memory addresses to idle or zero. Otherwise, based on the current and required operation states of the Writeback, Receiver, and Transmitter modules, it determines which module is allowed to communicate with the memory and sets the memory address and data input accordingly, directing the data to the correct location. Transmissions use addresses and data from the Rx or Tx Buffer Descriptors, while Writeback uses its own address and data inputs and can also read from or write to the Buffer Descriptors based on its own enable signal and the Completion Signal of the Buffer Descriptors."
