    "block_comment": "This part of code triggers a timing check whenever there is a positive edge detected in the 24th bit of the 'dqs_in' signal. It achieves this by using the 'always @' syntax that is an event control construct in Verilog, and calling the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check()' with the index 23 if the mentioned change in signal is detected."
