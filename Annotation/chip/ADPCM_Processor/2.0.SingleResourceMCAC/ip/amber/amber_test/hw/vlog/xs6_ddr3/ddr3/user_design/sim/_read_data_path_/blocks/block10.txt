Comment: 
This block of code functions as a synchronous reset and data transfer mechanism based on the rising edge of a clock signal. The block implements this function by using an always block that responds to the positive edge of an input clock. Inside the block, it checks if reset (rst_i[1]) or manual_clear_error signal is asserted. If either is asserted, it resets multiple signals including dq_lane_error_r1, dq_lane_error_r2, data_valid_r, and cumlative_dq_lane_error_reg to zero. If neither is asserted (during normal operation), it transfers the state of data_valid_i to data_valid_r, dq_lane_error to dq_lane_error_r1, and cumlative_dq_lane_error_c to cumlative_dq_lane_error_reg.
