Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for managing the receiver bit pulse count in a serial communication setting. It resets the receiver bit pulse count (`rx_bit_pulse_count`) to zero every time the restart signal (`restart_rx_bit_count`) is high at the positive edge of the clock cycle (`i_clk`). If the restart signal is not high, the pulse count is incremented at each clock cycle.
