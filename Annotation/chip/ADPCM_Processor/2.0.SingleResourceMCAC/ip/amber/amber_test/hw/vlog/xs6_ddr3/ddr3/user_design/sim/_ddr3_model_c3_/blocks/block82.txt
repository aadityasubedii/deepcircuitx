Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for monitoring changes in the 49th bit of the dq_in input data vector. Whenever there is a change in the value of the 49th bit of the dq_in data, the dq_timing_check function is triggered with an argument value of '48'. The always construct creates a continuously monitoring loop waiting for the defined condition, i.e., change in dq_in[48], to be met, and initiates the function as soon as it happens.
