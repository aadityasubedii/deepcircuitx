    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to set up the length of a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS). The implementation depends on the type of FPGA family in use. If the family is 'SPARTAN6', the block checks the lowest six bits of the 'prbs_bl' variable. If those six bits hold a zero value, the length gets assigned a one, else it retains its existing value. If the family is not 'SPARTAN6', the length is automatically set up to two."
