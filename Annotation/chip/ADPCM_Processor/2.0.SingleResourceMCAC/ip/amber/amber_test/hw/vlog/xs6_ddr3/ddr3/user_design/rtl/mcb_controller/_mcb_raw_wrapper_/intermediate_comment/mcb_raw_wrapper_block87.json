    "block_comment": "This block maps command byte addresses to row, bank, and column addresses for a memory system with configurable address ordering (ROW_BANK_COLUMN or other), command queue, bank width, column bits, and port configuration. The code uses ternary operators and if-else structures to handle different values of these configurations. For each command port (p0 to p5), it creates variables (pX_cmd_ra, pX_cmd_ba, and pX_cmd_ca) for the row address, bank address, and column address, which are derived using bit manipulations on the command byte address and configurations. It considers all possible configurations of port for the fifth and sixth ports (p4 and p5), assigning them row, bank, and column addresses accordingly."
