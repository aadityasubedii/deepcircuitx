Comment: 
The given block of code shows an 'assign' statement responsible for determining the status of a scan operation. The operation 'ScanStatusOp' is assigned a result based on boolean AND operation of 'SyncStatMdcEn' and the inverse of 'InProgress', 'InProgress_q1', and 'InProgress_q2'. Here, the scan operation is considered as successful when 'SyncStatMdcEn' is enabled and none of the 'InProgress' signals are active.
