    "block_comment": "This block of code is a behavioral modelling segment in Verilog concerned with the monitoring of the circuit timing. Specifically, the block is designed to call the function dqs_neg_timing_check every time there is a negative edge (falling transition) detected on the 6th index of the dqs_in signal. This function is most likely used to check the timing integrity within a data-queue system (DQS).\n"
