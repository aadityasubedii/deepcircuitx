Comment: 
This block of Verilog code activates a procedure named `dq_timing_check` whenever the 26th bit (index 25) of the input data queue (`dq_in`) changes its state. The function of the block, specifically its always @(dq_in[25]) section, acts as an event detector that triggers the `dq_timing_check` procedure when this specific data bit undergoes any transition (either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0).
