    "block_comment": "This block of code performs the function of advancing the read pointer in a First In, First Out (FIFO) structure. When a read clock (rd_clk) rising edge is detected, the read pointer increments by 1 if a 'pop' signal (i_pop) is received and the FIFO structure is not empty (!o_empty). By updating rd_pointer in this way, sequential data reading from the FIFO is enabled."
