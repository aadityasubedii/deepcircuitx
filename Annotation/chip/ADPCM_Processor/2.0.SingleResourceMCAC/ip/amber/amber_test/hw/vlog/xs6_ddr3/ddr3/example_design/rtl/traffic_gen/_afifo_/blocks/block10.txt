Comment: 
This single line block of Verilog RTL code controls the enablement of read strobe signal (rd_strobe). It implements by assigning rd_strobe the logical AND of the read enable signal (rd_en) and the logical negation of the empty signal. This means rd_strobe will be active (high) only when the read is enabled and the buffer is not empty, which ensures data is present to be read.
