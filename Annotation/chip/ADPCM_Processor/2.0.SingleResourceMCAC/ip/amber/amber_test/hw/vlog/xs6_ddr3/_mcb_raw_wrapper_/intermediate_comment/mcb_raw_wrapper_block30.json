    "block_comment": "The Verilog code block functions as a serial-to-parallel data converter using the OSERDES2 component. Looping through the given address width, it instantiates and configures the OSERDES2 for every bit of the address. The component communicates with outside elements using I/O clock (ioclk0), system rest (int_sys_rst), and pll_ce_0 signals. Internal data is derived from address_90; all remaining data and control ports are kept low (at '0') which make this a straightforward data serialization setup, not indulging in any data manipulation inside OSERDES2 block. This is a typical case of using OSERDES2 to send data out maintaining very high data rates."
