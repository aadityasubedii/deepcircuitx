This block initializes a synchronizer through a reset Rx clock interrupt signal called `ResetRxCIrq_sync3`. This action is performed on every positive edge of the `RxClk` signal or when the `Reset` signal goes high. The `Reset` branch within the `always` block ensures that the `ResetRxCIrq_sync3` is cleared during a reset condition. Otherwise, the value of `ResetRxCIrq_sync2` is assigned to `ResetRxCIrq_sync3` later in the simulation cycle.
