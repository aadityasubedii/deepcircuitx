    "module": "Module-level comment: The eth_rxaddrcheck module checks the destination MAC address of incoming Ethernet frames, discerns if these are unicast, multicast, or broadcast, and validates addresses using specific conditions. Input signals provide control, hash values, and frame properties, which are evaluated at every clock edge or reset. Internal signals facilitate hashing and checking processes, and output signals indicate the status of frame reception and address recognition. Essential functions, including address checks and status updates, are implemented within 'always' blocks."
