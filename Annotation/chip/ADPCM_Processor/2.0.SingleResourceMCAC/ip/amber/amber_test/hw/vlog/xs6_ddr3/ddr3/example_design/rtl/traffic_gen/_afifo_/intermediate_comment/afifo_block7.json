    "block_comment": "This block is an assignment statement that calculates the amount of data (in terms of the number of elements) currently held in a buffer. The buffer's current filled status is determined by subtracting the read pointer (`rd_ptr`) from the write capture pointer (`wr_capture_ptr`). These pointers are assumed to be index locations within the buffer, with `wr_capture_ptr` pointing to where new data will be written and `rd_ptr` to where the next read will occur. This operation gives the difference, thus indicating how many elements have been written but not yet read in the buffer."
