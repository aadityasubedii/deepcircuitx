    "block_comment": "The `pick_way` function determines the least recently used (LRU) way for cache replacement. It paints through the `valid_bits` array from least significant to most significant, checking for any invalid (0) bits. If it finds an invalid bit, it sets the respective `pick_way` bit high and returns. If all `valid_bits` are set, it defaults to a pseudo-random selection based on the input `random_num`, distributing choices as per a defined pattern."
