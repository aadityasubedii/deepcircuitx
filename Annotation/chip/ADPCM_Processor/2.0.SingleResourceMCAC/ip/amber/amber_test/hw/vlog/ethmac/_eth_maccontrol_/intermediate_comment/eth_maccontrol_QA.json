It manages the control frames, handling both the reception and transmission side of Ethernet packets, including formulating pause frames and reacting to incoming control frames. The module interfaces with the dedicated transmit and receive control modules, managing several signals such as Start Frame, End Frame, data in and data out, done, abort, among others. Conditions that trigger the transmission of pause frames are handled within this module. Notations suggest that the module can operate in two clock domains: for transmission (MTxClk) and reception (MRxClk)."
