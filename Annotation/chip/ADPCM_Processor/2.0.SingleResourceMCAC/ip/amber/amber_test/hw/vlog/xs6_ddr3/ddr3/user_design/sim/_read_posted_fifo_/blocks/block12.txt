Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages the control logic for a wait signal. The signal, "wait_done", is asserted or de-asserted based on a mix of conditions examined at every positive edge of the clock. Upon reset, "wait_done" is immediately set true, otherwise it depends on the status of command readiness and validity or wait counter value. If a valid command is ready or the wait count has reached zero, it implies that no waiting is necessary, thus "wait_done" is set true. In all other cases, the device is kept in a wait state by setting "wait_done" false.
