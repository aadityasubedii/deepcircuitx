    "block_comment": "This block of code functions to disable an event counter within specific conditions, discussed outside this block. The implementation achieves this by assigning a binary value of zero to the control signal 'counter_en', in effect disabling the counter operation. This code block is typically used when certain conditions are met and it's necessary to stop the counting operation for a certain period or until certain other conditions are met. It ascertains efficient system operation by managing resources as per the demands of system states or conditions."
