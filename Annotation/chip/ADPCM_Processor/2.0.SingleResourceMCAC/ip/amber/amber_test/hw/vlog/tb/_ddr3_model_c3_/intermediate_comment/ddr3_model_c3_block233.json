    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a differential clock signal. In response to a positive edge of the input clock signal 'ck_n_in', it inverts the input clock signal and assigns it to 'diff_ck' on such event. This results in 'diff_ck' output being the complement of the input clock 'ck_n_in'. Thus, when 'ck_n_in' is HIGH, 'diff_ck' is LOW and vice versa, achieving a differential clock signal."
