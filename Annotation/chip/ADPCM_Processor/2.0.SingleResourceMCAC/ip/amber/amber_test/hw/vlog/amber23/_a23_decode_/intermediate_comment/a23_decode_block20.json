    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the variable `mtrans_base_reg_change` a concatenated 27-bit value. The rightmost two bits are '0', followed by the current value of `mtrans_num_registers`, and extended with 25 leading zeroes. The purpose of this could be to align the value of `mtrans_num_registers` in a specific bit range, when this value is used within a larger bus or word width."
