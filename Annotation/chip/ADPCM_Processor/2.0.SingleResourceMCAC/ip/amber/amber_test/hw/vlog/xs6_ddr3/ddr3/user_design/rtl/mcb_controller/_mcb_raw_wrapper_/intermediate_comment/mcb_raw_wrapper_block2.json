    "block_comment": "The block of code dynamically configures the data strobe signal (dqs) for memory read/write operations based on the type of memory (DDR, MDDR, DDR2) being interfaced. If the memory type is DDR or MDDR or if it is DDR2 without the differential data strobe enabled, it only enables a pull-down resistor on the data strobe line. In all other cases, it enables both pull-down and pull-up resistors on the data strobe lines, facilitating a differential signal mode for a more robust and noise resilient memory interface."
