    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to manage the 'empty' status flag for a buffer in a synchronous system. The 'empty' flag is asynchronously reset to 1 when the reset signal 'rst' is active. On every positive edge of the read clock 'rd_clk', the 'empty' flag is set to 1 when 'buf_filled' equals 0 or when 'buf_filled' is equal to 1 and 'rd_strobe' is active, indicating that the buffer is either empty or about to be emptied. Otherwise, the 'empty' flag is set to 0, indicating that the buffer contains data."
