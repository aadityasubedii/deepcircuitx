    "block_comment": "This block generates a fixed address based on certain input parameters. If the command pattern is either \"CGEN_FIXED\" or \"CGEN_ALL\", a fixed address is produced depending upon the data width (DWIDTH). For a data width of 32, the address is right-shifted by two places and extended by two zeroes. Similarly, for the data width of 64, the address is right-shifted by three places and extended by three zeroes. This pattern continues for other cases until the data width is greater than 256, where the address is right-shifted by six places and extended by six zeroes."
