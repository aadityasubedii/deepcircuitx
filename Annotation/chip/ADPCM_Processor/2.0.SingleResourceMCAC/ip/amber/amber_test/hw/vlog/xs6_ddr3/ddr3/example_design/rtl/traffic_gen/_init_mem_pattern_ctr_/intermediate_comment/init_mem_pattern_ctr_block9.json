    "block_comment": "This block is used to synchronize the value of the 'run_traffic' signal with the rising edge of input clock signal 'clk_i'. The implementation is achieved through an always block in Verilog activated on the positive edge of 'clk_i'. Each time a positive edge of 'clk_i' is detected, the output 'run_traffic_o' is updated to the current value of 'run_traffic'."
