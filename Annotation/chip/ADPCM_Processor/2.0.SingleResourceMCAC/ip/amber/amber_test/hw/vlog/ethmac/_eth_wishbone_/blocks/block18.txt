Comment: 
The block of code manages the reset operation and loading process for a register `LatchedRxLength`. When a positive edge of a master clock `MRxClk` or `Reset` signal is detected, the code responds. If the `Reset` signal is activated, it sets the `LatchedRxLength` register to zero with the timing parameter `Tp`. Alternatively, if `LoadRxStatus` is enabled but the system is not in reset mode, the data from `RxLength` is loaded into `LatchedRxLength` with the timing parameter `Tp`.
