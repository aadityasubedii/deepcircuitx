This block of Verilog code disables the clock-enable training signal for memory types other than DDR2. The implementation is straightforward: an if-statement checks the memory type (`C_MEM_TYPE`) and if it is not DDR2, it assigns a '0' bit (false) to the `cke_train` signal via an assignment operator.
