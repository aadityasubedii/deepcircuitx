    "block_comment": "The block of code serves as a pattern generator for DDR memory interface debugging and validation work. When the number of Data Query (DQ) pins is 144 and the DATA_PATTERN is set as \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", or \"DGEN_ALL\", this block activates. Implementing this functionality, the conditional statements within this generate-if block specify the selection criteria. At every clock's positive edge (posedge), the activities within this block are carried out."
