    "block_comment": "This block of code is a reset sequence used to establish initial conditions for a simulation or design. The sequence activates at the positive edge of the signal `rst_n_in`. It performs various checks on the reset timing, such as requiring 200 microseconds before `RST_N` becomes inactive and maintaining `CKE` inactive for 10 nanoseconds prior. It outputs warnings or errors on the display if these conditions are not met. Depending on the system configuration (\"MAX_MEM\" defined or not), it might set `memory_used` to 0."
