    "module": "Module-level comment: This `main_mem` module is a memory component supporting both read and write operations. The module functions in 32-bit or 128-bit modes, based on the parameters (WB_DWIDTH and WB_SWIDTH). Input ports handle various signals like clock, memory control, wishbone interface signals including strobe, write-enable, select, address. Output ports produce data, acknowledgment and error signals. Internally, the module uses signals for busyness status, read/write initiation, data handling, and making the write data selective. The code executes write and read operations in well-structured blocks inside a 'generate' construct which separates 32-bit and 128-bit data treatment. Simultaneous read/write operations are prevented and all operations are synchronized with the clock signal."
