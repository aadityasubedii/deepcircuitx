    "block_comment": "This block of code is a hardware implementation of a synchronous First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer, which is a type of buffer used in digital systems. This buffer, known as 'cmd_fifo', has the capability to store up to 16 elements of 38 bits each. The block employs a specific instance of a 'afifo' module to accomplish this functionality. Signals to write ('wr_en', 'wr_data', 'wr_clk') and read ('rd_en', 'rd_data', 'rd_clk') from the buffer are provided. The FIFO buffer's status is signaled by two flags: 'full' and 'empty', which hint at the presence or absence of data in the buffer, respectively. The clock 'clk_i' and reset 'rst_ra[0]' signals provide synchronization and reset capabilities. Inputs 'cmd2flow_bl' and 'cmd2flow_addr' are written to the buffer and outputs 'xfer_cmd_bl' and 'xfer_addr' are read from the buffer."
