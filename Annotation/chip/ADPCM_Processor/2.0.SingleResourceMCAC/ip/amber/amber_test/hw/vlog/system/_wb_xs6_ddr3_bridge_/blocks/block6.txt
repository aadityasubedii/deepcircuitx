Comment: 
This block of code enables the write operation of a system. The write enable signal (`o_wr_en`) is assigned through a Boolean operation made of two conditions: `wr_en_r` and `!i_cmd_full`. `wr_en_r` is assumingly a reg signal that represents the high-level assertion for a write operation, while `!i_cmd_full` stands for the condition that the command queue is not full. The operation is permitted only when both conditions, having an active write signal and the command queue not being full, are met.
