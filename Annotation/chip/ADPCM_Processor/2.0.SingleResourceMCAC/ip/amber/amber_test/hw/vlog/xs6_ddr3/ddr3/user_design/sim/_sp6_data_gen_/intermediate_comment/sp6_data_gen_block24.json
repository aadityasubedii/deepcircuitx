    "block_comment": "This block of code dynamically generates hardware for 64-bit data processing. Based on the condition if data width (DWIDTH) is equal to 64, the block data_out64 is instantiated. The always block inside this instantiation is sensitive to multiple signals i.e., 'adata', 'hdata', 'ndata', 'w1data', 'prbs_data', 'data_mode_i' and 'fixed_data_i'. Therefore, the always block triggers whenever there are any changes in these signals."
