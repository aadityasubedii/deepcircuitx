    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the reading of data from a FIFO buffer during a transmission process (Tx). Following a positive edge transitions of either the MTxClk clock signal or a Reset signal, the block conditionally sets the signal ReadTxDataFromFifo_tck. The block implements its function by utilizing a sequential if-else structure. Upon a reset signal, it sets the ReadTxDataFromFifo_tck to 0. If a transmission starts and certain data count conditions are met, it sets the aforementioned signal to 1. Otherwise, based on a specific synchronization condition, it sets the signal back to 0."
