The block of code updates the Verilog hardware description status bits based on the core stall signal. Specifically, it assigns the inverse value of the "i_core_stall" input signal to the "status_bits_mode_rds_oh_update". This assignment occurs continuously anytime the "i_core_stall" signal changes state, effectively making "status_bits_mode_rds_oh_update" the indicative signal of whether the core is stalled or not.
