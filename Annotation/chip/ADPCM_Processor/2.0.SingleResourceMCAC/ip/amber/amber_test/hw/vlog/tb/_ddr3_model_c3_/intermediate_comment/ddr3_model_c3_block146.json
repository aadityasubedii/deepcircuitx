    "block_comment": "This block invokes a procedure `dm_timing_check` whenever changes are detected on the digital signal `dm_in[1]`. The execution mechanism is dynamically controlled: `dm_timing_check` is executed upon a transition in the value of `dm_in[1]`, using the value `1` as its argument; this design mimics an interrupt-based system where routines are executed based on the changes in specific signal values."
