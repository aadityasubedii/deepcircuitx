    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily controls MCB (Memory Controller Block) state transitions and UIDR (MCB User Interface Data Read) update. If the MCB refresh flag (MCB_UOREFRSHFLAG) is asserted, the code sets the MCB_UIDRPUPDATE high and transitions the state to OFF_RZQ_PTERM; otherwise, the system waits in WAIT6 state. If MCB_UOREFRSHFLAG is not asserted, it transitions the MCB state to LDQS_CLK_WRITE_P_TERM."
