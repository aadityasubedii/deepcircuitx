Comment: 
This block of code manages reset and clock signal handling for a hardware latch in the design. Upon detection of a rising edge in either the 'reset' or 'clk' signals, if there is a 'reset' signal, this module will clear the 'fetch_only_stall_r' register to 0 indicating no stall; else it will store the current state of the 'fetch_only_stall' signal into the 'fetch_only_stall_r' register, effectively latching the stall state for the rest of the circuit to acknowledge.
