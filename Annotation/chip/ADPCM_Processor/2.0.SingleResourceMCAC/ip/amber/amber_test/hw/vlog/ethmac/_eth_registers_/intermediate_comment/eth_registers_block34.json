    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns values to three output ports from ethernet parameters. These ports are the Inter Packet Gap transmit (r_IPGT), Inter Packet Gap Receive 1 (r_IPGR1), and Inter Packet Gap Receive 2 (r_IPGR2). Each of them receives a 7-bit value from their corresponding input ports IPGTOut, IPGR1Out, and IPGR2Out. It's implemented using the assign statement of Verilog to directly map input to output signals in a combinational logic fashion."
