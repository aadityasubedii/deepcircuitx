    "block_comment": "This block of code calls a function `dqs_pos_timing_check' on the positive edge of `dqs_in[7]`. The function is implemented using an `always` block, which continually checks if `dqs_in[7]` has a value change from 0 to 1 (positive edge), and each time this occurs, it calls the function `dqs_pos_timing_check` with the index value 7."
