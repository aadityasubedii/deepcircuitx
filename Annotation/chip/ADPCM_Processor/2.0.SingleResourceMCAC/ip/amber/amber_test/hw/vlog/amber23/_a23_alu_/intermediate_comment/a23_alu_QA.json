It takes two 32-bit inputs, i_a_in and i_b_in, and a 9-bit i_function input, which decides the operation to be performed on the inputs. A carry input from a Barrel Shifter (i_barrel_shift_carry) and status bits (i_status_bits_carry) are also considered as part of inputs. The results of the operation are returned as a 32-bit 'o_out' output and a 4-bit flags 'o_flags' that provides overflow, carry-out, zero, and sign flags. It handles input swapping, not operation, carry and overflow management, and it supports hardware specific operations (like FPGA from Xilinx)."
