    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates the Read operation in the Rx Block Descriptor (BD). It performs this action when the Rx status write is active, or when there's a signal to abort the third Rx synchronization and there's no signal to abort the fourth Rx synchronization, or when the enable signal for Rx is true and its last state (r_RxEn_q) is false."
