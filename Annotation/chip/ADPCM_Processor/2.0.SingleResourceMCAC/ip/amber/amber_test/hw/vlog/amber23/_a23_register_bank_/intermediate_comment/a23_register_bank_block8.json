    "block_comment": "This block maps internal registers to their output counterparts and manages some special conditions for specific registers. For r0-r7, data is directly assigned to corresponding output registers. For r8-r12, when 'firq_exec' flag is active, the corresponding 'firq' value is assigned, otherwise the original register value is routed to the output. Finally, r13 and r14 depend on whether 'usr_exec', 'svc_exec', 'irq_exec' are active, so the output is assigned based on the active flag with 'firq' value as default."
