Comment: 
The block primarily governs multicast functionality in the hardware. Upon getting a positive edge from the MRxClk clock signal or a Reset signal, the Multicast process begins. If Reset is triggered, 'Multicast' is set to '0', effectively disabling it. In the absence of a Reset, the block checks for several conditions. 'Multicast' is set to '1', enabling it, if a specific bit in the StateData is set, ByteCntEq1 is set, and a particular bit in the LatchedByte is set. Conversely, if either RxAbort or RxEndFrm is set, 'Multicast' is reset to '0', thus, turning it off.
