Comment: 
This block of code is a clock-driven counter for system resets in a dynamic calibration scenario. Upon a rising edge of the UI_CLK signal, if the system is in the START_DYN_CAL_PRE state, it increments the 'pre_sysrst_cnt' register. In all other states, this block resets the 'pre_sysrst_cnt' register to zero.
