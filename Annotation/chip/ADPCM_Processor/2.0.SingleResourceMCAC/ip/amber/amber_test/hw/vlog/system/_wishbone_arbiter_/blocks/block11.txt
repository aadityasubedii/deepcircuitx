This block of code is responsible for routing various data and control signals from the master to slave2 in a bus-like logic system. The block assigns the master's address, data, and selection signals directly to corresponding output signals for slave2. It also uses conditional logic to gate the master's write enable, cycle, and strobe signals. Specifically, these signals are only propagated if the `current_slave` is identified as '2'. Otherwise, those signals are set to '0', effectively disabling write, cycle, and strobe operations for slave2.
