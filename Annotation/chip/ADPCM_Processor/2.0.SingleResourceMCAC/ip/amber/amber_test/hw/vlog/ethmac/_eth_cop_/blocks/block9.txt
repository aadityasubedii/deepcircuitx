This is a procedural block triggered by positive edge of write-back clock or reset signaling. Upon reset, it initializes the operation indicators and output signals for modules 1 and 2 to default states. In a clock cycle, depending on the status of module 1 and module 2, it either sets outputs for a new write-back operation or resets the flag to indicate completion of an operation. The operation indicators and interface control signals (like cycle, strobe) rely on whether the module 1 or module 2 is addressed. The block, thus, helps implement several operations controlled via write-back protocol, ensuring orderly execution and error handling in case of unspecified address access.
