    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the condition for when the transmit FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer is empty. The FIFO emptiness is determined by whether the Write Pointer (txfifo_wp) is equal to the Read Pointer (txfifo_rp). If they are equal, that means there are no more data elements left in the FIFO to read, indicating it is empty."
