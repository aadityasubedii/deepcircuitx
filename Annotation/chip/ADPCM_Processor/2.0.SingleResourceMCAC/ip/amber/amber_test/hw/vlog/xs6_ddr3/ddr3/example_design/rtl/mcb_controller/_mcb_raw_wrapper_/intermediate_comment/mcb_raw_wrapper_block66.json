    "block_comment": "This block checks the state of C_PORT_ENABLE[3] and controls the assignments of various memory interface (mig_p3_) and command signals (p3_cmd_). If C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is set, the relevant mig and cmd signals are tied to other signals or values. Otherwise, if C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is not set, it sets all memory interface and command signals to zero, effectively disabling the memory interface for this block. It's a switch block controlling the assignment of specific processing unit signals based on memory interface port's enable state."
