    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the reset functionality for a transmitter completion interrupt flag (SetTxCIrq) in a synchronous digital circuit. When subjected to a positive edge clock cycle or a high signal on the reset line, the if-else statement within this block gets executed. If the circuit is reset, it sets the interrupt flag (SetTxCIrq) to '0' with a delay (Tp). Else, it sets the interrupt flag as the bitwise AND of 'SetTxCIrq_sync2' and the bitwise NOT of 'SetTxCIrq_sync3', also with a delay of Tp."
