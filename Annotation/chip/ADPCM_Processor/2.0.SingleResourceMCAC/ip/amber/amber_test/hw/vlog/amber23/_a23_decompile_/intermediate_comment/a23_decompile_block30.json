    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is utilized for immediate shifting and expansion based on the instruction type and the execute phase of the instruction. Implementation-wise, condition handling with ternary operators (?:) facilitates this task. Twofold checking is performed. First, if the operation type is REGOP and the 26th bit of the instruction is '1', the shift operation is set. Thereafter, based on the values of bits 8 to 11 of the instruction (execute_instruction[11:8]), 'imm32' gets defined. Here, a specific chunk of 'imm8' is appended with a calculated number of zeros to yield a 32-bit output. Each possible condition of execute_instruction[11:8] constitutes a particular case and determines the specific format of the immediate to be used in the instruction; anything unaccounted for redirects to a default case."
