    "block_comment": "This block is primarily designed to handle data read and write operations in different user interface modes of the memory interface. It does so by assigning the write and read clock for both mig_p0 and mig_p1. It then enables the write and read according to the user interface mode, using 'AXI' for simple data enable or a function of data enable and whether or not the write or read is full or empty for other modes. Write data and write mask are then assigned for two different word lengths, with the first 32 bits going to mig_p0 and the rest to mig_p1. Finally, it concatenates read data from mig_p1 and mig_p0."
