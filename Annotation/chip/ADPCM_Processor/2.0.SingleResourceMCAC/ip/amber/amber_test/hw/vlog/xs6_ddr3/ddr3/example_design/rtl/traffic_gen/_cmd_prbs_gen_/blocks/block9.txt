This block of code handles the updating of the value of a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS). The `always @` statement signifies that the code within its scope (the block of code) is triggered whenever there's a change in the bits between index 1 and 32 of lfsr_q. When this event is triggered, the value of the PRBS becomes equal to the current value of bits 32 to 1 of lfsr_q.
