The block defines a function `get_index` that searches for a given address `addr` in a sequence of stored addresses and returns '1' if the address is found within the range, '0' otherwise. This is achieved by initializing `get_index` to 0, then iterating over each location in memory. If a match is found with the input `addr`, `get_index` is set to 1 and the loop is prematurely exited using the `disable` keyword.
