    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a top-level embedded system design, integrating an Amber processor core with memory interfaces, peripherals, and a Wishbone bus interconnect. It manages system clock/reset, instantiates core components (processor, memory, UART, Ethernet, timers), handles I/O operations, and supports different configurations for FPGA/ASIC implementations. The module uses Wishbone bus for internal communication and provides interfaces for external connections like UART, Ethernet, and DDR3 memory."
