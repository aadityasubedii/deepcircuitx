    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is primarily responsible for performing dynamic calibration after self-refresh based on certain conditions. The state transitions operate on rising edges of the UI_CLK clock. There are conditional branches for reset signalling and the state of a dynamic calibration start. During a reset, it holds the 'PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH' and 'START_DYN_CAL_STATE_R1' signals to zero. For non-reset states, it triggers the 'PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH' signal if 'WAIT_SELFREFRESH_EXIT_DQS_CAL' is true, but only when not in start dynamic cal and after ensuring 'START_DYN_CAL_STATE_R1'. If the condition is not met or we're in start dynamic cal and self-refresh is not operational, 'PERFORM_START_DYN_CAL_AFTER_SELFREFRESH' is set to zero."
