    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for the management of the read status of a memory controller buffer (MCB). It specifically checks whether the buffer is empty or not. The block executes at the positive edge of the input clock (clk_i). If reset (rst_ra) is active, it immediately sets the read status as empty (mcb_rd_empty_r). Additionally, if the buffer count (mcb_rd_fifo_counts) is less than or equal to one, it sets the read status as empty as well. Else, the read status is set to not-empty. The process includes an intrinsic delay #TCQ (Time Clock Quality) to replicate real hardware behavior."
