    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns input signals to their respective internal signals for a module related to command and write operations. It includes arbiter enable and control lines for command operation, along with instruction, byte address, burst length info, and command queue status signals. Similarly, it encompasses clock, enable signal, write data, write mask, and write queue status signals for write operations. These assignments aid in the internal handling of information and control operations within the hardware module and are critical for executing functionalities seamlessly."
