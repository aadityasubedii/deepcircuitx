Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for triggering the function 'dqs_even_receiver' whenever there is a positive edge detected in bit 8 of 'dqs_even' signal array. The function is triggered by responding to a rising edge or positive edge transition (from 0 to 1) on the specific array index of the signal 'dqs_even'. The function call is encapsulated within an 'always' block to ensure constant sensitivity to the changes in 'dqs_even[ 8]'.
