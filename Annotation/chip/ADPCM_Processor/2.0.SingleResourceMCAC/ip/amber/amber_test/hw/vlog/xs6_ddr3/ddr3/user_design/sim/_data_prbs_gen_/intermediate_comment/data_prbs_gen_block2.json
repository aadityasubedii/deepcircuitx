    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is involved in the implementation of a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) for a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) generator. The 'always' keyword indicates that this block triggers on every bit change in the specific part of 'lfsr_q' vector, specifically from the 1st to 'PRBS_WIDTH' bit. This is mainly used for generating a shuffled or pseudo-random binary sequence 'prbs' that is equal to the current tapped bits of 'lfsr_q'. This block is vital in applications such as digital communications for creating random bit sequence testing."
