This block controls the fetch and write operations in a coprocessor wait state to handle various types of instructions and change status bits. When the control is in the COPRO_WAIT state, and there is an instruction to be executed with no conflict, the pre-fetch instruction write enable flag is set. If the 21st bit of the instruction is set, it checks the 16th to 13th bits. If these are 15, various status bits are set based on the execution bits. If they are in User mode, three other status bits options are enabled. If the bits are anything other than 15,  the next register bank write enable value depends on the decoded value from the 16th to the 13th bits. If the 21st bit is not set, the next coprocessor operation is queued to perform the second operation.
