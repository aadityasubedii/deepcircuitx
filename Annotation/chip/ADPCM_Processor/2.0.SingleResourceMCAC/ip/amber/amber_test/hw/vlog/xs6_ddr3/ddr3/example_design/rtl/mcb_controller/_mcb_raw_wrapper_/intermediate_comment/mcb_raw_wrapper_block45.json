    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for assignments and conditions between various memory interface generator (MIG) signals and processor signals. Taking inputs like p0_cmd en, ra, ba, ca, instr, and bl, it assigns values to respective mig signals. It also assigns 'wr_clk' and 'rd_clk' signals from processor 0 to processor 1. The user interface mode is checked, after that the write enable signals 'mig_p0_wr_en' and 'mig_p1_wr_en' are assigned, with additional condition added if the interface mode is not \"AXI\". Finally, the least significant 32 bits of 'p0_wr_data' are assigned to 'mig_p0_wr_data'."
