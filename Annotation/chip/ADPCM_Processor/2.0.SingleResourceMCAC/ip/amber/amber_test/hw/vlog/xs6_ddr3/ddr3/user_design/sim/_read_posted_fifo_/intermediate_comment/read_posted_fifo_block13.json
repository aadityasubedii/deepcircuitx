    "block_comment": "This code block is a simple synchronous counter with reset functionality. Upon each rising edge of the input clock, if a reset signal is high, the wait counter resets. However, if a command ready and valid flag is set, the wait counter is set to 2. If these conditions are not met and the wait counter is greater than zero, it decrements."
