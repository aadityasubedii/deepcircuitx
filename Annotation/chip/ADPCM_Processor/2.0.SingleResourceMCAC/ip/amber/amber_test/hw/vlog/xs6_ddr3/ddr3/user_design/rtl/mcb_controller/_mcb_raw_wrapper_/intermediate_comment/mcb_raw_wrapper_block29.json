    "block_comment": "This code block is a data serialization module for memory bank addresses. It utilizes the OSERDES2 component of Xilinx FPGAs to transform parallel data into serial data. The block generates a sequence of OSERDES2 modules according to the width of the memory bank address. Each OSERDES2 instance takes a slice from the parallel memory bank address input (`ba_90`) and generates serial output (`ioi_ba`). The data rate and output mode are defined by constants, and the system clock (`ioclk0`) and system reset (`int_sys_rst`) are used for synchronizing the operation. Dummy inputs and unused outputs are set to defaulted values."
