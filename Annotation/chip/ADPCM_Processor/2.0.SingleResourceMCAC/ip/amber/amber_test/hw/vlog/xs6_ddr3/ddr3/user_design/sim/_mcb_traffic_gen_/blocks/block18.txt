Without the necessary context of the code block, it's challenging to provide a suitable example. However, considering a given hypothetical block of Verilog code, here's how the process can work:

Example Verilog code:
```verilog
module AND_GATE (input logic a, b, output logic f);
 assign f=a&b;
 endmodule
```
The comment to be generated in this case, following the format, could be:

"An AND Gate implementation in Verilog code. The module named "AND_GATE" takes two logic inputs 'a' and 'b', and returns a logic output 'f'. The function of this code block is to perform a bitwise AND operation between the inputs 'a' and 'b', with the result assigned to output 'f'."

Given the real set of Verilog codes, you can train a language model for code comment generation tasks in the described manner. The format could be extended or reduced based on the complexity of code blocks you're working with.
