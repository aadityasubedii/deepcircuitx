    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code serves as an error checking mechanism for command execution pertaining to port 5. Whenever there's an event that modifies any of its sensitive variables, it checks if a specific 24-bit section of PORT_CONFIG is set to \"R32\", if command enable for port 5 (p5_cmd_en) is asserted, and if the third and first bits of p5_cmd_instr are both deasserted. If all these conditions are upheld, an error message indicating an invalid command for a read-only port 5 is displayed, and the simulation stops."
