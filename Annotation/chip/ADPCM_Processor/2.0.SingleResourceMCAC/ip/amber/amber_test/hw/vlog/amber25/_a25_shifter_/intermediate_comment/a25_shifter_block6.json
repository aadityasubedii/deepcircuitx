    "block_comment": "This block implements a quick logical shift right (LSR) operation on a 32-bit input. The amount of shift is determined by the least significant two bits of 'i_shift_amount'. If 'i_shift_imm_zero' is true, the output is a shift right by 32 bits. If the shift amount is zero, the original input is combined with the carry-in bit at the high-order end. For shift amounts of one to three, the operation shifts right the respective number of bits and zero fills the high-order bits."
