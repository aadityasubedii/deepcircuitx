    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a command task (cmd_task) that processes various DDR SDRAM commands. Here's a summary of its function and implementation:\n\n[Function of the block]: The cmd_task handles various DDR SDRAM commands, including Load Mode Register, Refresh, Precharge, Activate, Write, Read, ZQ Calibration, and Power Down/Self Refresh operations. It manages the internal state of the memory device, checks for timing violations, and updates relevant counters and flags.\n\n[Implementation details of the block]: The task uses a large case statement to process different commands based on the input 'cmd' signal. It performs extensive error checking for timing violations and illegal operations. The task updates internal registers and counters to track the state of banks, rows, and columns. It also manages power-down and self-refresh modes, DLL locking, and initialization sequences. The implementation includes debug messages for various operations and error conditions, and it uses multiple pipeline structures to handle command timing and dependencies."
