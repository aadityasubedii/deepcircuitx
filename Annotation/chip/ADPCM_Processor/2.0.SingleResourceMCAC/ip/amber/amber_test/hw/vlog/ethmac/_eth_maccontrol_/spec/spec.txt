Module name: eth_maccontrol

Module specification: The eth_maccontrol module is a core component of an Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) system tasked with handling control frames on both the outgoing (transmission) and incoming (reception) sides. It interfaces with transmit and receive control modules, managing notable signals such as Start Frame, End Frame, data in and data out, done, and abort. Additionally, it is responsible for formulating pause frames and reacts accordingly to incoming control frames. The module operates under two primary clock domains, one for transmission (MTxClk) and another for reception (MRxClk).

Input Ports: These include clocks for transmission and reception (MTxClk and MRxClk respectively), reset signals (TxReset and RxReset), transmit data inputs (like TxDataIn, TxStartFrmIn, and TxEndFrmIn), control signals (e.g., TPauseRq and CrcEnIn), and receive-related signals (e.g., RxData and RxValid). Control flags such as TxFlow and RxFlow, as well as specific mode signals like r_PassAll, are also part of the input ports.

Output Ports: These include transmission data (TxDataOut, TxStartFrmOut, TxEndFrmOut, etc.), transmission control signals (like TxDoneOut and TxAbortOut), and indicators and flags regarding control frame transmission (WillSendControlFrame, TxCtrlEndFrm etc.). Outputs also include signals like CrcEnOut and PadOut, which controls the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) operation and manages padding to ensure minimum packet size, respectively.

Internal Signals: Notably, there are latches and multiplexers for managing the "abort" and "done" states in transmission (e.g., TxUsedDataOutDetected, TxAbortInLatched, TxDoneInLatched, MuxedDone, and MuxedAbort). Additionally, wires are used for control frame-related operations (e.g., Pause, TxCtrlStartFrm, ControlData, CtrlMux, and SendingCtrlFrm) and to control transmission progression (BlockTxDone).

Code Blocks: The code contains multiple blocks, each serving specific functions. For instance, some blocks manage internal signals based on conditions as per transmission states and reset signals. Others assign values to output signals based either directly on corresponding input signals or on logical outcomes of internal and input signals. Lastly, eth_receivecontrol and eth_transmitcontrol blocks are instantiated to manage the receive and transmit functionalities of the ethernet MAC control subsystem respectively.
