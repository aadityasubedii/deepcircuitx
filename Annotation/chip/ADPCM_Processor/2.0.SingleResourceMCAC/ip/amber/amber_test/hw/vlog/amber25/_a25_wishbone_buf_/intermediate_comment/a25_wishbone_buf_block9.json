    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code manages a buffer usage counter based on 'push' and 'pop' operations under various conditions. The code is triggered at the rising edge of 'reset' or 'clk'. Upon a reset signal, the buffer usage counter 'wbuf_used_r' is set to zero. During normal operation, if both 'push' and 'pop' occur simultaneously, the counter remains unchanged. However, if only 'push' occurs, the counter is incremented by one and if only a 'pop' operation occurs, the counter is decremented by one."
