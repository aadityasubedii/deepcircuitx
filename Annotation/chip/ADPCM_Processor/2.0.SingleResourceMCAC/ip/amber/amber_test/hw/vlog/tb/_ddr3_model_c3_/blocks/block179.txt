Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for triggering the function `dqs_odd_receiver` at every positive edge of `dqs_odd[12]`. It listens to changes in `dqs_odd[12]` and when a change from low-to-high (positive edge) occurs, it invokes the `dqs_odd_receiver` function with `12` as an input argument.
