    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) used for pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generation. Upon a positive edge of the input clock (`clk_i`), the implementation checks if `prbs_seed_init` is asserted; if so, the LFSR (`lfsr_q`) is initialized with the provided seed value (`prbs_seed_i`). Alternatively, if the clock enable signal (`clk_en`) is high, the LFSR advances its sequence by shifting to the right with certain bits flipped based on the XOR operation between specific LFSR bits, thus generating a new pseudo-random output."
