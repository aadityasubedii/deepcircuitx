    "block_comment": "The block of code is a hardware timing check in Verilog, specifically focused on the bit 7 of the input signal dm_in. It ensures that the 7th bit of dm_in meets specific timing requirements by using the user-defined procedure dm_timing_check. This block of code is always active (i.e., it responds to all changes in state), and it calls the sub-routine dm_timing_check with 7 as an argument whenever dm_in[7] changes its state."
