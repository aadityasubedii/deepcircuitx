The data_task block handles memory data checks, reads, and writes. It first checks for errors like tDSS and tDQSS violations and ensures correct latching edges during clock periods. The block then handles memory read when either write (wr) or read (rd) pipelines are indicated. It uses a @{BO_BITS-1:0} counter for burst operations and a separate counter for write-data-strobe (WDS) and edges. A memory_write operation is called when a burst counter aligns with a certain minimum burst length. It also manages data output (dq_out) settings during random out delay, adjusting various timing and synchronization parameters. For read data strobes (rdqs) and enable signals (dq_out_en, dqs_out_en, dqs_out, dq_out), the block employs delay elements.
