    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the output of the netgen[0] module to the rot_prod signal. The operation is a simple connection operation where the output of the netgen module, accessed using the 'out' attribute, is connected directly to the rot_prod signal, meaning that the state of rot_prod will always reflect the state of netgen[0]'s output."
