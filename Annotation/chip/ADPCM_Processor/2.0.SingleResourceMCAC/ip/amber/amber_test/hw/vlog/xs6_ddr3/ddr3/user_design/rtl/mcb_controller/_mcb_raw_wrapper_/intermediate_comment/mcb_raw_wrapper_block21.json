    "block_comment": "The block defines a master OSERDES2 (Output Serializer/Deserializer) that's being used to serialize and send parallel data over slower serial lines. The block achieves its function by initializing the OSERDES2 parameters such as the data rate of the outputs (OQ and OT), the mode of the output (OUTPUT_MODE), SERDES mode (SERDES_MODE), and data width. The defined signals include an output data signal, clock signals, data input signals, clock enable signals, an output clock enable signal, reset signal, shift input signals, and training signals. The inputs are mostly hardcoded to '0' or '1', indicating it's set to a fixed operation where conditions rarely change. The keys OQ and TQ serve as the output data paths."
