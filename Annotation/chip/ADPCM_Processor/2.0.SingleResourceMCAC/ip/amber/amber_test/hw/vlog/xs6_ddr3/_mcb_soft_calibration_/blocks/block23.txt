Comment: 
This block of code configures the DRAM termination impedance as part of the DRAM Register Power Interface (DRPI) sequence. The code sets the Active_IODRP to RZQ, marks the command as valid, and set ups the write operation to the memory cell addressed by PTerm with no data (8'b00). "PTerm", "NTerm" and "MCB_UIDRPUPDATE" are also set accordingly. Lastly, the state is altered based on IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N; either remaining at the current "OFF_RZQ_PTERM" or transitioning to "WAIT7".
