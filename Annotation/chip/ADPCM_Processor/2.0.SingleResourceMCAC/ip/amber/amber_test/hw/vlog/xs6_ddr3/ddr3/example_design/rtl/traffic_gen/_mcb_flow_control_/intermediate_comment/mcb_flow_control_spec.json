    "spec": "Module name: mcb_flow_control. \n\nModule specification: The module `mcb_flow_control` is a Memory Controller Block (MCB) flow control unit; it primarily operates based on a state machine with five main states (READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, REFRESH_ST). This module is designed to manage commands related to memory operations such as Read, Write, Refresh, etc. \n\nInputs to the module (1) clk_i: the clock input, (2) rst_i: 10-bit reset, (3) cmd_valid_i: command validation, (4) cmd_i: command type, (5) addr_i: command operation address, (6) bl_i: burst length for command operation, (7) mcb_cmd_full: signals whether memory command is full, (8) last_word_wr_i: last word write operation completion signal, (9) wdp_rdy_i: write data port ready signal, (10) last_word_rd_i: last word read operation completion signal, (11) rdp_rdy_i: read data port ready signal.\n\nOutputs of the module (1) cmd_rdy_o: next command readiness, (2) cmd_o: type of command being executed, (3) addr_o: address of command operation, (4) bl_o: Burst Length for command operation, (5) cmd_en_o: signal if command execution is enabled, (6-8) wdp_valid_o/ wdp_validB_o/ wdp_validC_o: signals for different parts of data word written, (9) wr_addr_o: address for write operation, (10) wr_bl_o: burst length for write operation, (11) rdp_valid_o: read operation validity signal, (12) rd_addr_o: address for read operation, (13) rd_bl_o: burst length for read operation.\n\nInternal signals include command FIFO ready signal (cmd_fifo_rdy), read and write command signals (cmd_rd, cmd_wr), push and transfer command signals (push_cmd, xfer_cmd), validity signals for current read and write commands (rd_vld, wr_vld), command ready signal (cmd_rdy), register for active command, address and burst length (cmd_reg, addr_reg, bl_reg), validity signal for read data port (rdp_valid), validity signals for different parts of data word written(wdp_valid, wdp_validB, wdp_validC), current and next states signals of the control flow (current_state, next_state), and signals indicating pending write or read command (cmd_wr_pending_r1, cmd_rd_pending_r1).\n\nThe module primarily operates based on a state machine with five main states (READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, REFRESH_ST). Each state manages the command execution, coordination between read and write operations, status of command FIFO and also determines the next state based on a combination of conditions from the input and internal signals. The state machine is sensitive to the condition of mcb_cmd_full, wdp_rdy_i, and rdp_rdy_i, which are signals depicting memory command buffer status, write data port readiness, and read data port readiness, respectively. Further, each register update and signal assignment happens on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk_i). Overall, this module efficiently manages the flow control in a Memory Controller Block (MCB).",

The module is focused around a state machine (READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, REFRESH_ST) that handles transitions for various commands related to memory operations (Read, Write, Refresh and others). \n\nTransitions occur on rising edge of a clock signal, and various outputs are set/updated based on the current state. There are parts of the module that handle memory read, write, waiting, refresh, and other command operations. Inputs to the module include command validity, command type, address, burst length, memory full signal, and memory ready signals. \n\nOutputs include readiness of command, command type, data address, burst length, and different memory-valid signals indicating different parts of data word have been written. The module has additional handling for SPARTAN6 family. \n\nIt uses a set of registers to store local state, addresses, command type, and for sending to other parts of the system. Registers are synchronous and are updated on a rising clock edge. They are enabled by various conditions relating to the current state of the system and input signals. Wire connections are used to connect logical components, and assign statements are used to define combinational logic. Several inline comments indicate that this module is sensitive to timing considerations especially with SPARTAN6 family FPGAs."

This module is designed to manage commands related to memory operations such as Read, Write, Refresh, etc. \n\nInputs to the module (1) clk_i: the clock input, (2) rst_i: 10-bit reset, (3) cmd_valid_i: command validation, (4) cmd_i: command type, (5) addr_i: command operation address, (6) bl_i: burst length for command operation, (7) mcb_cmd_full: signals whether memory command is full, (8) last_word_wr_i: last word write operation completion signal, (9) wdp_rdy_i: write data port ready signal, (10) last_word_rd_i: last word read operation completion signal, (11) rdp_rdy_i: read data port ready signal.\n\nOutputs of the module (1) cmd_rdy_o: next command readiness, (2) cmd_o: type of command being executed, (3) addr_o: address of command operation, (4) bl_o: Burst Length for command operation, (5) cmd_en_o: signal if command execution is enabled, (6-8) wdp_valid_o/ wdp_validB_o/ wdp_validC_o: signals for different parts of data word written, (9) wr_addr_o: address for write operation, (10) wr_bl_o: burst length for write operation, (11) rdp_valid_o: read operation validity signal, (12) rd_addr_o: address for read operation, (13) rd_bl_o: burst length for read operation.\n\nInternal signals include command FIFO ready signal (cmd_fifo_rdy), read and write command signals (cmd_rd, cmd_wr), push and transfer command signals (push_cmd, xfer_cmd), validity signals for current read and write commands (rd_vld, wr_vld), command ready signal (cmd_rdy), register for active command, address and burst length (cmd_reg, addr_reg, bl_reg), validity signal for read data port (rdp_valid), validity signals for different parts of data word written(wdp_valid, wdp_validB, wdp_validC), current and next states signals of the control flow (current_state, next_state), and signals indicating pending write or read command (cmd_wr_pending_r1, cmd_rd_pending_r1).\n\nThe module primarily operates based on a state machine with five main states (READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, REFRESH_ST). Each state manages the command execution, coordination between read and write operations, status of command FIFO and also determines the next state based on a combination of conditions from the input and internal signals. The state machine is sensitive to the condition of mcb_cmd_full, wdp_rdy_i, and rdp_rdy_i, which are signals depicting memory command buffer status, write data port readiness, and read data port readiness, respectively. Further, each register update and signal assignment happens on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk_i). Overall, this module efficiently manages the flow control in a Memory Controller Block (MCB)."

The module is focused around a state machine (READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, REFRESH_ST) that handles transitions for various commands related to memory operations (Read, Write, Refresh and others). \n\nTransitions occur on rising edge of a clock signal, and various outputs are set/updated based on the current state. There are parts of the module that handle memory read, write, waiting, refresh, and other command operations. Inputs to the module include command validity, command type, address, burst length, memory full signal, and memory ready signals. \n\nOutputs include readiness of command, command type, data address, burst length, and different memory-valid signals indicating different parts of data word have been written. The module has additional handling for SPARTAN6 family. \n\nIt uses a set of registers to store local state, addresses, command type, and for sending to other parts of the system. Registers are synchronous and are updated on a rising clock edge. They are enabled by various conditions relating to the current state of the system and input signals. Wire connections are used to connect logical components, and assign statements are used to define combinational logic. Several inline comments indicate that this module is sensitive to timing considerations especially with SPARTAN6 family FPGAs."

This module is designed to manage commands related to memory operations such as Read, Write, Refresh, etc. \n\nInputs to the module (1) clk_i: the clock input, (2) rst_i: 10-bit reset, (3) cmd_valid_i: command validation, (4) cmd_i: command type, (5) addr_i: command operation address, (6) bl_i: burst length for command operation, (7) mcb_cmd_full: signals whether memory command is full, (8) last_word_wr_i: last word write operation completion signal, (9) wdp_rdy_i: write data port ready signal, (10) last_word_rd_i: last word read operation completion signal, (11) rdp_rdy_i: read data port ready signal.\n\nOutputs of the module (1) cmd_rdy_o: next command readiness, (2) cmd_o: type of command being executed, (3) addr_o: address of command operation, (4) bl_o: Burst Length for command operation, (5) cmd_en_o: signal if command execution is enabled, (6-8) wdp_valid_o/ wdp_validB_o/ wdp_validC_o: signals for different parts of data word written, (9) wr_addr_o: address for write operation, (10) wr_bl_o: burst length for write operation, (11) rdp_valid_o: read operation validity signal, (12) rd_addr_o: address for read operation, (13) rd_bl_o: burst length for read operation.\n\nInternal signals include command FIFO ready signal (cmd_fifo_rdy), read and write command signals (cmd_rd, cmd_wr), push and transfer command signals (push_cmd, xfer_cmd), validity signals for current read and write commands (rd_vld, wr_vld), command ready signal (cmd_rdy), register for active command, address and burst length (cmd_reg, addr_reg, bl_reg), validity signal for read data port (rdp_valid), validity signals for different parts of data word written(wdp_valid, wdp_validB, wdp_validC), current and next states signals of the control flow (current_state, next_state), and signals indicating pending write or read command (cmd_wr_pending_r1, cmd_rd_pending_r1).\n\nThe module primarily operates based on a state machine with five main states (READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, REFRESH_ST). Each state manages the command execution, coordination between read and write operations, status of command FIFO and also determines the next state based on a combination of conditions from the input and internal signals. The state machine is sensitive to the condition of mcb_cmd_full, wdp_rdy_i, and rdp_rdy_i, which are signals depicting memory command buffer status, write data port readiness, and read data port readiness, respectively. Further, each register update and signal assignment happens on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk_i). Overall, this module efficiently manages the flow control in a Memory Controller Block (MCB)."
