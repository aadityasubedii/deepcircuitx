Comment: 
This block of Verilog code governs the conditions and operations of data strobe (DQS) delay adjustments in a memory control block (MCB). When the DQS delay exceeds its lower limit and a counter "counter_dec" is at least 4, the block immediately signals for a decrement in both MCB UILDQSDEC and MCB UIUDQSDEC while reducing the DQS delay by 1. Furthermore, if the DQS delay is greater than its lower limit during the second state, the system transitions to the 'decrement' state. If none of these conditions are met, the system reverts back to the start of the dynamic calibration.
