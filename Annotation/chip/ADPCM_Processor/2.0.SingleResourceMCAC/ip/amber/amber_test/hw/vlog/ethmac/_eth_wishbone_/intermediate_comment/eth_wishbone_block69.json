    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing the state of the `TxRetry_wb` signal based on the `Reset` signal and `WB_CLK_I` clock edge events. Implemented as an active-high asynchronous reset, when `Reset` goes high, `TxRetry_wb` is immediately set to `0`. However, under normal operation (when the `Reset` is low), the `TxRetry_wb` signal is updated on every rising edge of the `WB_CLK_I`, essentially mirroring the state of `TxRetrySync1` with a delay of `#Tp` unit of time."
