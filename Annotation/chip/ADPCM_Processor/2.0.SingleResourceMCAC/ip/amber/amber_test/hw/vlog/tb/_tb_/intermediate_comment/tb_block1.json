    "block_comment": "The function `insert_32_into_128` is designed to insert a 32-bit word into a 128-bit word at different positions. Depending on the `pos` given as input, the 32-bit word (`word32`) is inserted into the 128-bit word (`word128`) at different places: position 0 (at the end), position 1 (with 32 bits off the end), position 2 (with 64 bits off the end), or position 3 (at the start). The outcome is then returned as a new 128-bit word."
