This Verilog block determines the control signal outputs based on the state of the 'Active_IODRP' variable. The 'case' construct is used to check the value of 'Active_IODRP', and based on this, takes one of three distinct actions (`RZQ`, `ZIO`, or `MCB_PORT`). Each action assigns unique values to the variables 'RZQ_IODRP_CS', 'ZIO_IODRP_CS', and 'IODRP_SDO'. In the `default` case, all the outputs are reset to 0 if 'Active_IODRP' does not match any predefined cases.
