This block of code is for a write operation in an asynchronous FIFO memory element. When there are positive edges on the write clock ('wr_clk') and the write enable ('wr_en') signal is high and the FIFO is not full ('full' signal is low), the write data ('wr_data') is assigned to the memory location pointed by the write address ('wr_addr') after a delay of 'TCQ' time units.
