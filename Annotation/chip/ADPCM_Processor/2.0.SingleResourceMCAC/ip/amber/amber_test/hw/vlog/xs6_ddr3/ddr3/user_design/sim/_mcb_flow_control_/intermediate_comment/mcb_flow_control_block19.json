    "block_comment": "This block manages the command enable signal (cmd_en_r1) in a synchronous design. Synchronized with a rising edge of clk_i, it handles reset condition and transfer command (xfer_cmd) as well as checks the fullness of an MCB command. If reset flag (rst_i[8]) is set, it disables cmd_en_r1. Alternatively, if 'xfer_cmd' is asserted, it enables cmd_en_r1, but in case the MCB's command buffer isn't full (!mcb_cmd_full), it automatically disables cmd_en_r1."
