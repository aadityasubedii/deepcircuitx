    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code defines a mechanism to select modes for data and address in response to a reset signal and a modify-enable signal. On the rising edge of the clock, when a reset is activated, the data mode is set to DATA_MODE and the address mode is set to '11'. However, if the reset is not activated and the modify-enable signal is set, the data mode and the address mode values are updated with `syn1_vio_data_mode_value[2:0]` and `vio_addr_mode_value` respectively."
