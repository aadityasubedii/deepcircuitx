    "module": "Module-level comment: The iodrp_controller is a finite state machine that handles reading and writing data to/from a memory cell under control of various input signals. Internally, it uses logic and sequential assignments with blocks that manage state transitions, data shifting, selection, counting, and input/output assignment. It also stores the current and next states of the FSM for decision-making. In addition, it has safety mechanisms to recover to a default state when failures occur. Particularly, it makes use of broadcasting as well as synchronous resetting functionality. This module offers a robust system for managing memory cell data I/O."
