    "block_comment": "This block provides a 16-bit masking functionality controlled by a 4-bit selector input. Based on the value represented by 'low_selector', it assigns a specified hexadecimal mask value to 'low_mask'. It uses an 'always' block and a 'case' statement to listen for changes in 'low_selector'. Each binary value in the case statement corresponds to a unique hex mask value indicating particular bits to be masked in 'low_mask'."
