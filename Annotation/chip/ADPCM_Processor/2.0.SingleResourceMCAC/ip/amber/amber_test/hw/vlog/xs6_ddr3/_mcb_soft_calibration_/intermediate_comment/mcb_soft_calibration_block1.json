    "block_comment": "Apologies for the confusion, but the block of code provided is incomplete. I need a more comprehensive code block that includes the entire `case` or `if` structure to understand the logic that's in action so that I can give a meaningful summary. Please provide a full Verilog RTL code block for me to process and provide a suitable comment.\n\nHere is a format on how you provide the code:\n\n```\nmodule your_module_name (\n    input wire x,\n    output wire y\n);\n\nalways @(posedge clk) begin\n    //Your code here  \nend\n\nendmodule\n```\n\nIf you provide a code according to this structure, I can easily analyse the code and suggest a meaningful top-level comment."
