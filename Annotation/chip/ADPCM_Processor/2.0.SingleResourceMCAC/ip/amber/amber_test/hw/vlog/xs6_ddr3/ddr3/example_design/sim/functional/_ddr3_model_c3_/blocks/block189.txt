Comment: 
This block of Verilog code represents a clocked process that gets triggered at the positive edge of the signal 'dqs_odd[ 2]'. When the positive edge of 'dqs_odd[ 2]' happens, it calls the 'dqs_odd_receiver' method with 2 as a parameter. The function aims to synchronize the peripheral signals with the clock 'dqs_odd[ 2]'.
