    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code handles write-back logic (WB) from a master to a specific slave (Slave 1). It assigns master address, data and select lines to respective write-back lines. Furthermore, it only enables the write enable (We), cycle (Cyc), and strobe (Stb) lines of slave 1 when the current_slave identifier equals 1. This uses conditional statements to selectively activate slave interaction for a specific slave in the system."
