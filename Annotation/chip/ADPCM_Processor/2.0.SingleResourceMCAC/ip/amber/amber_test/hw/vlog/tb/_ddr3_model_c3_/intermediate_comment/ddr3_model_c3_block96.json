    "block_comment": "This block of code executes a function named 'dq_timing_check' which takes an argument of the 35th bit of the dq_in array. The operation is typically part of a digital circuit design, and it is an example of a sensitivity list in Verilog. In the block, the function 'dq_timing_check' is called every time there is a change in the 35th bit of the 'dq_in' vector."
