    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a fixed address depending on the data width (DWIDTH) and the command pattern (CMD_PATTERN). The address generation is implemented using conditional assignments in Verilog. For \"CGEN_FIXED\" or \"CGEN_ALL\" command patterns, the fixed address is created by concatenating a part of the input address with zeroes. The number of zeroes and the part of the input address used depends on the value of DWIDTH; larger values would append more zeros."
