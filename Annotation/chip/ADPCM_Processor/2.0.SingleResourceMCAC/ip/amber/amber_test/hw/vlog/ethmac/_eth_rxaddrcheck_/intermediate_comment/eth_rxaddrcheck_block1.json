    "block_comment": "This block of code is assigning the value of a specific bit from the ByteHash to HashBit. The specific bit being selected from ByteHash is determined by the three least significant bits of CrcHash. This is carried out using the bit-wise indexing feature in Verilog, providing a dynamic way to select a bit based on the value of another variable."
