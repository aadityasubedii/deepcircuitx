Comment: 
This block of code forms a synchronous counter that counts the number of valid data received. When the 'clk_i' signal undergoes a positive-edge transition and the 'rst_i' signal is high, it resets the 'rd_data_received_counts' to zero. If the 'rst_i' is not active but 'data_valid_i' goes high, the count of 'rd_data_received_counts' increases by one. The count update of 'rd_data_received_counts' is subject to propagation delay modeled by the #TCQ timing control.
