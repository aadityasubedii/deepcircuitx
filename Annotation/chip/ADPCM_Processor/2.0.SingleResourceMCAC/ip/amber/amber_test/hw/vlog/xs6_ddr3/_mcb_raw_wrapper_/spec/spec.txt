Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface, designed to handle the physical interface between an FPGA and external DDR/DDR2/DDR3 memory. It manages address, data, and control signals, implementing various I/O standards, clock management, and data serialization/deserialization. The module supports different memory types, data widths, and configurations through parameters. Input ports include system clocks, reset, and multiple port interfaces for commands, write data, and read operations. Output ports consist of memory interface signals, status signals for each port, and overall status information. Key internal signals include reset synchronization, PLL lock gating, and self-refresh control. The module is structured with sections for I/O buffer instantiation, IODRP2 (I/O Device for Regional clocking) configurations, and port-specific logic
