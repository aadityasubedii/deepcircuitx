Module name: afifo. 

Module specification: afifo is an asynchronous First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue implemented in Verilog. The primary function of this module is to handle data inputs and feed them out in the same chronological order. Its operations of writing data (push operation) and reading data (pop operation) are regulated through control signals i_push and i_pop. This module has an interface consisting of input data (i_data), write clock (wr_clk), read clock (rd_clk), push control (i_push), and pop control (i_pop). The outputs from the module include output data (o_data), FIFO full status indicator (o_full), and FIFO empty status indicator (o_empty). Internal variables include the write and read pointers (wr_pointer and rd_pointer), their delayed (wr_pointer_d1, rd_pointer_d1, wr_pointer_d2, rd_pointer_d2) and grayscale versions (wr_pointer_rd, rd_pointer_wr), and the data array. The grayscale logic transformations are implemented with gray8 and ungray8 functions. These pointers track the positions to write or read data in the FIFO, while grayscale versions prevent errors in asynchronous scenarios. The data array is the FIFO's storage. The code is divided into several blocks, each assigned with tasks like writing process, reading process, pointer value update under clock signal, and assignment of output logic and data. As a result, the module ensures error-resilient first-in-first-out operation with effective storage and retrieval of data.
