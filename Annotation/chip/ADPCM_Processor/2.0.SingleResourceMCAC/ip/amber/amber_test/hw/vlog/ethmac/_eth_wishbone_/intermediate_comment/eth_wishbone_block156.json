    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code governs the behavior of the Write-Back acknowledge signal, `WB_ACK_O`. Upon a positive edge of the Write-Back clock signal (`WB_CLK_I`), the acknowledge signal is conditionally updated after a delay (`#Tp`), based on the states of several bus signals: `BDWrite`, `BDRead`, `WbEn`, and `WbEn_q`. Essentially, it asserts `WB_ACK_O` if a write operation or a not-previously-enabled read operation is set to occur and, in both cases, the bus should be enabled for write-back (`WbEn` is true)."
