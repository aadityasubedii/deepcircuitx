    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to initiate operations in a digital system. Specifically, it assigns the logic OR output of three operation signals (WriteDataOp, ReadStatusOp, and ScanStatusOp) to the 'StartOp' signal. As a result, if any of the three operation signals (WriteDataOp, ReadStatusOp, and ScanStatusOp) is high, the 'StartOp' signal will be set high, indicating that an operation should begin. This block therefore acts as a control structure, initiating operations based on specified conditions."
