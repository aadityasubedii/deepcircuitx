    "block_comment": "This block of code performs data generation based on the settings of the Spartan 6 family chips. It uses an instance of the sp6_data_gen module to generate data. The inputs and outputs of this instance include multiple control signals, address, original seeds for PRBS, fixed data, and more, all being used to either control the data generation or carry the data. The user_burst_cnt is set to determine the number of cycles for data burst, and the fifo_rdy_i signal is used to indicate the readiness of the FIFO. The generated data is output through data_o."
