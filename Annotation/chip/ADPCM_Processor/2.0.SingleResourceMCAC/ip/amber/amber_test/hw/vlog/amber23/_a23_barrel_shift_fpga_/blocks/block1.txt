This block defines a function that reverses the bit order of an input. The function, `bit_swap`, takes a 16-bit input `value` and returns a 16-bit output whose bits are in reverse order of the input. This is accomplished through a `for` loop which iterates over each bit position from 0 to 15, and assigns the bit at position `i` of the output to the bit at position `15-i` of the input. In doing so, the bit in the highest position of the input ends up in the lowest position of the output, and vice versa, effectively reversing the bit order of the input.
