This block primarily deals with two interfaces: a read-write interface for the p3_rd and p3_wr operations and the AXI bus interface for communication with the AXI bus. The direct assignments at the start initialize the read and write operations for the p3 interface, syncing the input and output between the local and external interface. The latter portion interfaces with the s3 AXI bus using the axi_mcb module, mapping read and write parameters from AXI to MCB operations. The AXI input addresses are masked with the given ADDR_MASK before being sent to the axi_mcb module. This module is configured with specific parameters like ID and ADDR width, narrow burst support, and coherency to ensure safe and effective communication with the AXI bus.
