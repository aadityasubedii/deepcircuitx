This block of code is responsible for specifying the write operations related to DDR3's On-Die Termination (ODT) functionality. It sets various data path and control signals attached to the memory cell locations. Specifically, it sets the 'IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR' to NTerm which is presumably a constant representing the memory address, 'IODRPCTRLR_R_WB' to write mode and 'IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA' to a value determined by 'N_Term_w', which probably designates the termination value to be written. The command to write to the 'IOI_UDQS_PIN' is then initiated by asserting the 'MCB_CMD_VALID'. The state machine remains in the current state until 'MCB_RDY_BUSY_N' is set, indicating the Memory Controller is ready for a new command, at which point it transitions to 'UDQS_PIN_N_TERM_WAIT' state.
