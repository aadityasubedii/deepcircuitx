This block of Verilog code handles a control flow signaling within a larger design. The always statement is clocked by a positive edge of clk_i. It sets a flag, wait_bl_end, under various conditions based on the reset input, a specific value of force_wrcmd_timeout_cnts, the status of general readiness and validity and also the magnitude of gen_bl, and the condition of wait_bl_end and user_bl_cnt_is_1. This block is a form of clocked always block, the flag it sets is used for producing time controlled output with a certain delay (specified by #TCQ), based on the given conditions.
