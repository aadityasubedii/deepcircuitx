The block defines a function that extracts single-bit signals based on an input parameter. This function takes a 3-bit input number and uses a switch case to determine which signal it will return: When the input is '000', it returns the write enable signal from the fetch unit U_FETCH; when the input is '001', it returns the fetch stall signal from the amber unit U_AMBER; when '010' it simply sends a 0 signal; and when '011', it returns the data access from the fetch unit U_FETCH.
