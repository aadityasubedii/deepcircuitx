Comment: 
This block primarily manages state transitions for the Verilog control module. On the rising edge of DRP_CLK, it updates several variables based on the current state represented by the nextstate variable. DRP_ADD and DRP_CS are set when nextstate signals either ADDR_PHASE or DATA_PHASE. MCB_UIREAD is set only when nextstate signals DATA_PHASE and rd_not_write_reg holds a true value. Furthermore, DRP_BKST is updated to the value of use_broadcast when the current state is READY.
