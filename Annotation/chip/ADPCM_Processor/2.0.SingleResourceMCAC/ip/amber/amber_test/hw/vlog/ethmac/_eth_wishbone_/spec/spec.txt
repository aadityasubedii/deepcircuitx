Module name: eth_wishbone. Module specification: This module implements a Wishbone interface for an Ethernet controller, managing communication between the Ethernet MAC and Wishbone bus. It handles transmit and receive operations, including reading/writing to transmit/receive buffers, managing interrupts, and controlling data flow. The module has numerous input ports for Wishbone signals, Ethernet transmit/receive signals, and configuration/status signals, and output ports for Wishbone responses, Ethernet control, and interrupt signals. Key internal signals include control flags, counters, and data buffers for managing transmit/receive operations. The module is divided into several functional blocks: Wishbone interface management, transmit operation control, receive operation control, buffer descriptor handling, FIFO management for both transmit and receive paths, and interrupt generation. It synchronizes data transfer between Wishbone and Ethernet clock domains, implements status monitoring and error handling for transmit
