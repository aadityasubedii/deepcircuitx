This block of code manages the handling of a reset condition and normal operation for the 'TxUsedDataIn_q' signal in a transmit data path. When a high or '1' signal is detected on 'TxReset', it immediately resets the 'TxUsedDataIn_q' by setting it to '0'. Otherwise, on the rising edge of 'MTxClk', the current value of 'TxUsedDataIn' is captured and assigned to 'TxUsedDataIn_q' after a propagation delay represented by '#Tp'. This ensures data synchronization within the transmitter and timely response to reset conditions.
