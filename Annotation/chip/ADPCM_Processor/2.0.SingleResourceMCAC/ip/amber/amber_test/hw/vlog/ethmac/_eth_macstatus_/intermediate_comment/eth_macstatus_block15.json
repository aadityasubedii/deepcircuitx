    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code defines the `TakeSample` signal behavior. The `TakeSample` signal is set high if either of two conditions are true: when any bit of `RxStateData` is high and `MRxDV` is low, or when the least significant bit of `RxStateData` is high, and both `MRxDV` and `RxByteCntMaxFrame` are high. This typically indicates a stage in a state machine where the system is ready to take a sample due to the received internal data valid (`MRxDV`) being low or the maximum frame byte count (`RxByteCntMaxFrame`) has reached its limit while received data is valid.\n"
