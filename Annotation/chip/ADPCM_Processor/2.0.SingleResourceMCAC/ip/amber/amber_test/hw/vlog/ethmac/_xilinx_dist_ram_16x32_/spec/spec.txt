Module name: xilinx_dist_ram_16x32. 

Module specification: The `xilinx_dist_ram_16x32` module leverages Xilinx's distributed RAM primitives to build a 16x32-bit read/write memory. Input ports include `we` (a single bit write enable signal), `wclk` (a synchronizing clock signal), `data_in` (32-bit input data for writing), as well as `write_address` and `read_address` (4-bit respective addresses for writing and reading operations). The module only has a `data_out` output port, serving 32-bit data read from the memory. Two critical internal signals are `waddr` and `raddr`, which reroute the write and read addresses respectively within the module. The focus of the module operation consists of 32 instances of a 16x1 RAM sub-module known as "RAM16X1D". Each instance dictates a single bit of the overall 32-bit word stored/read from the memory. The precise operation is carried out based on control signals provided (write enable and clock).
