    "block_comment": "This code block is a implementation of a Serializer/Deserializer (OSERDES2) module in a Verilog design. It transforms parallel data (ras_90) into a serial data stream (ioi_ras) under the control of a clock signal (ioclk0). Several parameters have been specified, including data rate, operation mode, and serialization data width. Unused data and shift inputs have been tied off to '0' for this implementation. The reset signal is 'int_sys_rst', and the output control enable 'OCE' is enabled all the time. The design also includes the option for bypassing Global Clock Flip Flops - something set as 'TRUE' in this design instance."
