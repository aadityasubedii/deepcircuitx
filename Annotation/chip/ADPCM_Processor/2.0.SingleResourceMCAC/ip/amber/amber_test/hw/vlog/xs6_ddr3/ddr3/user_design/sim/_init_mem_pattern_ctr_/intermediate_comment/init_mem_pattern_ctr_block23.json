    "block_comment": "This block of code checks if the parameter \"FAMILY\" is set to \"VIRTEX6\". If the condition is satisfied, it begins a generate construct named \"INC_COUNTS_V\". In Verilog, the generate construct allows conditional generation of hardware based on the parameter values. In this case, it'll generate different logic for a \"VIRTEX6\" FPGA family. It is an example of parameterised and conditional design in Verilog which enhances the reusability and scalability of the code."
