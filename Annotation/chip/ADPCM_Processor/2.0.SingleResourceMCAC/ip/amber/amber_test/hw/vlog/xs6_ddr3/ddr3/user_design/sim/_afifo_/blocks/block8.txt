This block of code is used to update and manage a read-pointer and its corresponding gray code in a FIFO on every rising edge of the read clock (rd_clk). The module resets (rst) the read pointer (rd_ptr) and the corresponding gray code (rd_gray) to zero at the beginning of execution. If the read strobe (rd_strobe) is not in reset state, the read pointer increments by 1. The temporary read pointer (rd_ptr_tmp) is then updated to the current state of read pointer. Finally, the read gray code takes the value of next read gray (rd_gray_nxt) at the end of execution.
