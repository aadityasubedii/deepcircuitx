    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe `eth_random` module is a pseudo-random number generator designed for system entities requiring randomization. Using several input counters, state and control flags, and clock signals, the module generates uniquely patterned random-number set limited to 10-bits. The pseudo-randomness is achieved using feedback-driven shift operations on an internal register `x`. The generated number is selectively latched into `RandomLatched` based on the state signals. Output flags `RandomEq0` and `RandomEqByteCnt` are also generated, providing state indications of the latched random number relative to specific conditions."
