    "block_comment": "The block is an initialization task for a memory device. It starts with a debug display statement indicating the commencement of the initialization sequence. The block consists of a series of 'cmd_task' function calls. These function calls issue commands such as NOP (No Operation), ZQ (Impedance Calibration), or LOAD_MODE. The LOAD_MODE command, when issued, loads values into mode registers (mode_reg3 - mode_reg0). Especially in the last LOAD_MODE call, an operation ('h100) is performed on mode_reg0 before it is passed as a parameter."
