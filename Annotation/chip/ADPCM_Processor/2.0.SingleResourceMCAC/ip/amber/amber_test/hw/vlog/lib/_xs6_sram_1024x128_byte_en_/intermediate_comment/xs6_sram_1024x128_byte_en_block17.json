    "block_comment": "This block of code is tasked with capturing the 10th bit of the input address on every rising edge of the clock and storing it in the register 'address_9_r'. The operation is implemented using an always block that is sensitive to the positive edge of input clock 'i_clk', which implies that the action inside this block will occur on each rising edge of 'i_clk'. The input address which is expected to be a multi-bit value has its 10th bit (indexed as 9 as Verilog uses zero-based indexing) sampled and stored to the 'address_9_r' register."
