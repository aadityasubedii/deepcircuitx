    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog codes is primarily handling error detection during instruction execution. When there are 'x' (don't care) values in either the least significant or most significant bit of the instruction being executed, the code block is designed to raise an error message. It operates by monitoring the control state, and when it's in execution mode (EXECUTE), it checks for 'x' in the instruction bits. If 'x' is detected, it triggers an error message, efficiently indicating any potential invalid instructions."
