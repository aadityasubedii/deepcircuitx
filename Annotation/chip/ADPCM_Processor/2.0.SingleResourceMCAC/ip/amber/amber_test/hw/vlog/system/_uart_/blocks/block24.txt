This block of code manages the logic for pushing and popping data from a FIFO buffer associated with a UART transmitter. Specifically, it determines when data should be pushed into or popped from the FIFO buffer. A new data push is initiated when a write operation starts and the address equals to the UART data register. This operation is only allowed if the FIFO buffer is not yet full. Data popping operation is triggered when the UART transmitter is in its final stop bit state, a bit pulse occurs and the FIFO buffer is not empty.
