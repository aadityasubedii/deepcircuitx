    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for error checking within a cache system. Specifically, it checks if data is hitting more than one cache way. If the sum of hit ways is more than 1, the block generates an error message stating, \"Hit in more than one cache ways!\". This operation is done in every rising edge of the clock signal, or when reset is high. If reset is high, no operation is performed in the current cycle."
