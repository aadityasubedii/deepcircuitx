Comment: 
This block of code is a preprocessor directive for configuration in Verilog. It is specifically designed for a Xilinx FPGA platform for a 32-byte enabled 4096x32 SRAM module. Dependent on defined parameters, the code conditionally includes specific memory parameter files. If the 'BOOT_MEM32_PARAMS_FILE' is defined, it includes the specified file. Otherwise, it checks if 'BOOT_LOADER_ETHMAC' is defined, in which case it includes 'boot-loader-ethmac_memparams32.v'. If neither is defined, it defaults to including 'boot-loader_memparams32.v'.
