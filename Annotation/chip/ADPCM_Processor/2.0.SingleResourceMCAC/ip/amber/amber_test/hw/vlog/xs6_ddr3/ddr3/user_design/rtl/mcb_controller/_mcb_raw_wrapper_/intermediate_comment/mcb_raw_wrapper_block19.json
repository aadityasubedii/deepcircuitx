    "block_comment": "This block represents the instantiation of an IOI_LDM (I/O Interconnect Latch Data MUX) module, which performs the function of a dual-data-rate serializer in the Verilog design. The module is configured with a master-serdes mode, in a single-ended output mode, bypassing the global clock flip flop and accepts a data width of 2. The data input is provided via 'dqplm' and 'dqnlm'. The output data ('ldm_oq') is clocked by a 90-degree shifted clock signal ('ioclk90'). Write enable signals 'dqIO_w_en_0' are provided to 'T1' and 'T2'. Resetting is controlled by 'int_sys_rst'."
