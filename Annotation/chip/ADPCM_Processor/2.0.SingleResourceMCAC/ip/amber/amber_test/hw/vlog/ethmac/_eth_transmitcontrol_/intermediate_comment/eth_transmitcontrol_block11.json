    "block_comment": "This block of code ensures a synchronization of the signals `ControlEnd` and `TxCtrlStartFrm` with the positive edge of the clock signal `MTxClk`. In every clock cycle, the current value of `ControlEnd` and `TxCtrlStartFrm` are sampled and stored into `ControlEnd_q` and `TxCtrlStartFrm_q` respectively, after a propagation delay defined by `#Tp`."
