    "block_comment": "This block of code triggers a timing check function already defined in the Verilog program. The particular action initiated is `dq_timing_check` every time there is a change in the 31st bit of the `dq_in` bus. The function call implies that there's some check or operation happening which is specifically dependent on the state of this bit."
