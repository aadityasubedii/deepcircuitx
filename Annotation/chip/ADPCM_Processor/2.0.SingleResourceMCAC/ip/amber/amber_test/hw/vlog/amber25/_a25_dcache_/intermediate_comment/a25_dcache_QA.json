It supports multiple cache ways (2, 3, 4, or 8) and implements features such as cache line filling, write-back, exclusive access, and cache flushing. The module manages cache hits and misses, handles read and write requests, and interfaces with external memory. It uses parameterized design to allow for flexible cache configurations, including the number of cache lines, words per line, and address widths. The cache employs a random replacement policy when all ways are valid and uses separate tag and data RAM structures for each way."
