Comment: 
The block of code is used for enabling or disabling on-die termination (ODT) for DDR2 and DDR3 memory configurations. It depends on the type of memory and the relevant resistor termination settings. If the memory type is DDR3, the ODT is enabled if either RTT or DYN_WRT_ODT is not OFF. For DDR2, the ODT is enabled if RTT is not OFF. The OBUFT block named 'iob_odt' drives the 'odt' signal to the 'mcbx_dram_odt' output bus when 't_odt' is high or transparently passes the 'ioi_odt' input to the output when 't_odt' is low.
