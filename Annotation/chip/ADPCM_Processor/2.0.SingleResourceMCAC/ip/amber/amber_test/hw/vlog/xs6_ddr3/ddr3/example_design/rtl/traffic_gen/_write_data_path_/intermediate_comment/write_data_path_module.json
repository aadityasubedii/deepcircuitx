    "module": "Module-level comment: This is the `write_data_path` module. It manages the control of data flow in a memory system, by governing the readiness, validness, and control signals needed for data writes. Input signals command the write operation, while output signals communicate state and actual written data. The module uses internal signals `data_valid` and `cmd_rdy` to coordinate tasks based on inputs and outputs from the `wr_data_gen` module. It is well-structured, incorporating the `wr_data_gen` module to assist in the data generation and writing, making it a crucial part of the memory system."
