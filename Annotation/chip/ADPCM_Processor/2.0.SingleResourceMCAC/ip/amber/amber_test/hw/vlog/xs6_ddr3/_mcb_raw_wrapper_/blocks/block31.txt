The module `counter` is a counter circuit implemented in Verilog. It increments the `count` register every positive edge of the `clk` if `enable` is high and `reset` is low. If `reset` is high, it will clear the binary counter back to `0`. It contains procedural statements (always @) wrapped inside a combinational logic block, which changes sequentially with respect to the clock or occurrence of any event. The `always @ (posedge clk or posedge reset)` block ensures that the counter can be reset asynchronously for immediate response whenever required. The count variable is declared as a four-bit register to align with binary number counting.
