    "block_comment": "This block of code is a function that determines a 'way' or path from given valid bits or employs a random number in case all valid bits are set. It scans through the bit vector 'valid_bits', a binary representation of available paths, and chooses the first path whose corresponding bit is 0 indicating it's unused. In case all paths are 'used' (i.e., all valid_bits are 1), it proceeds with a random selection mechanism. This is achieved by mapping different segments of a 3-bit wide slice (bits 3 to 1) of the input 'random_num' to different paths. The function, hence, either selects the first unused path or a random path when all are used."
