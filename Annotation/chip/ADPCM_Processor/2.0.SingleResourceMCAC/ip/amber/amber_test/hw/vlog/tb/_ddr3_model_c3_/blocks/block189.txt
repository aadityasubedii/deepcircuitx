Comment: 
This block of code defines a procedural block that is triggered by the positive edge of the signal `dqs_odd[ 2]`. When the value of `dqs_odd[ 2]` changes from low to high, it calls the function `dqs_odd_receiver` with parameter `2`. The purpose of this block is to execute some specific functionality (which is defined in `dqs_odd_receiver`) synchronized with the positive transition of `dqs_odd[ 2]`.
