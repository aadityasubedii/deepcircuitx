This block of code is a configuration condition checker. The block checks if the C_PORT_CONFIG constant equals to any one of the 16 different predefined configuration strings. If any of these comparisons are true, it initiates a named block using "begin : u_config1_0" which might include further procedure or instantiation related to this specific configuration setting.
