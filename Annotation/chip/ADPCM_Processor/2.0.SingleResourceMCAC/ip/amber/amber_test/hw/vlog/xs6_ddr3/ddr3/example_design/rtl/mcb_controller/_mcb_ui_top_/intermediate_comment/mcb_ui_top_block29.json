    "block_comment": "The function `rr` calculates the round-robin order for a specific number of ports, based on the port configuration and port enables. It first determines the maximum number of ports that should be considered, then counts the actual number of enabled ports. Thereafter, it constructs a value `rr` based on the order of enabled ports and finally, adjusts the order based on the current slot number. This function incorporates a series of switch-case statements and for-loop iterations, along with conditional checks, to fulfill these tasks."
