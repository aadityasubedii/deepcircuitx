This block of code is responsible for selecting the output data which is determined by the condition `addr_data_sel_n`. If `addr_data_sel_n` is true, then `memcell_addr_reg` is selected, otherwise, `data_reg` is selected. The selected data is pre-appended with a '0' bit (1'b0) and subsequently assigned to `data_out`.
