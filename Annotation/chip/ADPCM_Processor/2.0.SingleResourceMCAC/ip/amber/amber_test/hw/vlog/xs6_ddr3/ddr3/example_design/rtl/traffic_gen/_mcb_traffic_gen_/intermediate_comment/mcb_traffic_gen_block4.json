    "block_comment": "The given block of code is used to assign a default value in a Verilog design. Specifically, this line assigns the logical value '0' (false) to the wire 'cmp_error'. By doing so, the 'cmp_error' wire is initially set to indicate \"no error\", or a default error-free state. Modifications to 'cmp_error' might occur in the subsequent blocks depending on the error detection logic."
