This block serves as a system checker for a particular cache state. It verifies if data is hit in more than one of the eight cache ways by adding up the hit flags. If the sum of 'data_hit_way' signals is more than one, this indicates that data is hit in more than one cache way. This is a situation that should not occur and hence, the system calls a test bench error message and displays the text "Hit in more than one cache ways!" to notify the user of an exceptional situation.
