This block of code is used for creating pipelining in a digital circuit in Verilog RTL code. Every positive edge of the clock signal, the input data `cmp_data` is passed sequentially through a four-stage pipeline. Each line of the code represeting a stage, achieved using non-blocking assignments and delay specified by `#TCQ`, which denotes the time it takes for the data to be available at the next stage. At each clock edge, the data moves  one stage further in the pipeline.
