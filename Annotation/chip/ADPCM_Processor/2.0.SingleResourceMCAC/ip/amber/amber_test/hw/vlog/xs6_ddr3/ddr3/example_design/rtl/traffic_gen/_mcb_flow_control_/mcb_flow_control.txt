Module-level comment: This module, mcb_flow_control, provides flow control for a Memory Controller Block (MCB). It operates around a state machine (READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, REFRESH_ST) which handles memory operations (Read, Write, Refresh etc.) based on various inputs including command, address data, burst length and readiness signals. Transitions are performed on rising clock edges, creating a synchronized sequence of operations. Internal registers store local state, address, and command type while synchronous updates are performed under various conditions. This module also effectively handles special conditions for SPARTAN6 family FPGAs.
