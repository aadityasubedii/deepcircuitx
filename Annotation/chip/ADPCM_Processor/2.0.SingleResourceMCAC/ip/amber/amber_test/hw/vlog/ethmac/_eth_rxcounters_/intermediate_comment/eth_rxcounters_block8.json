    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a byte counter reset and increment mechanism. It is initiated either on the rising edge of the MRxClk signal or when the Reset signal is active. When the Reset signal is high, it resets the 16-bit ByteCnt to zero. If Reset is not active, it does two things: if the ResetByteCounter signal is active, it resets ByteCnt to zero; if the IncrementByteCounter signal is active, it increments ByteCnt by one. The delay '#Tp' is used before each operation on ByteCnt to denote the time propagation delay."
