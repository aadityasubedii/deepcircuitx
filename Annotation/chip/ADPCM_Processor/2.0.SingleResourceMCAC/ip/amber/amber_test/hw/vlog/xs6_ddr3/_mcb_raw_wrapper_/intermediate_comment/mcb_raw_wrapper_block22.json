    "block_comment": "The provided block of code defines a OSERDES2 instance in a Verilog RTL code, which is a series serializer and deserializer. It is used to serialize parallel data inputs to serialized output towards high-speed communication. Parameters of this OSERDES2 instance, such as data rates, output and series mode, clock bypass, and data width are established to be in line with the system requirements. In terms of inputs and outputs, IOCK0 is the main clock input, while IOI_CK is the serialized output. There is one training signal, \"TRAIN\", set to '0', indicating that no training sequence will be used. Further, PLL_CE_0 and PLL_LOCK signals are used to enable IO and output respectively. The remaining signals are set to constant values, indicating that they aren't utilized in this particular block configuration."
