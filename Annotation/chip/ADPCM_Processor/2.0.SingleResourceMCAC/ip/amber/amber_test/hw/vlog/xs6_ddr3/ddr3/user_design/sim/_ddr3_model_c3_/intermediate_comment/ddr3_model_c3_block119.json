    "block_comment": "The block of code performs an imperative check on the timing of data queue input (dq_in) at index 11. It utilizes an always block to perpetually monitor changes in \"dq_in[11]\", and once a change is detected, it promptly calls the \"dq_timing_check\" function with \"11\" as an argument. This continuous cycle helps ensure the timing of \"dq_in[11]\" stays within acceptable bounds."
