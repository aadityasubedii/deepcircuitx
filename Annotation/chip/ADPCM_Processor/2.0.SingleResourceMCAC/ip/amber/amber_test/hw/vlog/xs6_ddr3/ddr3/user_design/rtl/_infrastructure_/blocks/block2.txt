Comment: 
This block of code performs the function of a synchronous reset mechanism in a digital system. Triggered by either a positive edge of the clock signal 'clk0_bufg' or the reset signal 'rst_tmp', it uses a shift-register-based methodology to achieve synchronization. If the reset 'rst_tmp' is triggered, the register 'rst0_sync_r' is set high, indicated by '1'b1', across 'RST_SYNC_NUM' bits. On every positive clock edge, in the absence of a reset condition, 'rst0_sync_r' is right-shifted by one bit, which is representative of a countdown timer-like operation.
