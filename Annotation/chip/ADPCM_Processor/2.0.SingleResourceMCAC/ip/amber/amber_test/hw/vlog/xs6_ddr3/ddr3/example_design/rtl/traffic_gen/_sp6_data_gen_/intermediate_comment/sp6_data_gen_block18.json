    "block_comment": "The block of code handles different data modes and sets corresponding 8-bit signal patterns. If 'data_mode_i' is '3'b101' or '3'b100', a sequence of bit-shifted values from '8'h01' to '8'h80' are assigned to the 'SHIFT_X' registers and 'BLANK' is set to '8'h00'. Similarly, if 'data_mode_i' is '3'b110' or any other value, a sequence of reversed bit-shifted values from '8'hfe' to '8'h7f' are assigned to the 'SHIFT_X' registers and 'BLANK' is set to '8'hff'. The assignments are done using an always block, which suggests that signal patterns may change dynamically based on 'data_mode_i'."
