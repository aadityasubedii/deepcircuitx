    "block_comment": "This block invokes a timing check on dq_in at the 32th index. It detects and handles any timing related issues at the specific boundary within the dq_in signal array. This action is triggered always when there's a change in dq_in[32]. This routine is crucial for maintaining the signal integrity and avoiding any timing glitches which might corrupt data integrity in signal transmission."
