The block of code is a refresh timer counter, which resets or increments upon every positive edge of an input clock. The implementation leverages edge-triggered logic to either reset the `refresh_timer` to 0 if the 5th bit of the `rst_i` signal is true or increment the `refresh_timer` by 1 at each clock cycle when `rst_i`[4] is false. The delay of propagation is defined by the time constant `TCQ`.
