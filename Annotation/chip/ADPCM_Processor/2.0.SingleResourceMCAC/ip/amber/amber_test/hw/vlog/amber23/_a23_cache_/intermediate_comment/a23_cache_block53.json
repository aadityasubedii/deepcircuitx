    "block_comment": "This block controls the read buffer for a write-back stage in a pipeline. The buffer becomes valid only when certain fill conditions (CS_FILL1 to CS_FILL4) are met and there's no stall in the write-back stage. In such a case, it captures the write-back address and data. If the conditions aren't met, the buffer is invalidated."
