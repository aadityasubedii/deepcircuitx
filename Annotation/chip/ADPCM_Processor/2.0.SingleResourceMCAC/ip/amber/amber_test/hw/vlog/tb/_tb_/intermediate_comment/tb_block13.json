    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code initializes the test environment and manages the system reset signal. Initially, it sets the test mode and scan inputs to zero, following by asserting a system reset (sysrst). It then waits for a positive edge on the clock (clk_25mhz) and sets the reset signal back to 1. This is held for a defined number of clock cycles (`RESET_TICKS) until it de-asserts the reset signal by setting sysrst back to 0. This indicates a complete cycle of system reset for prepare the functionality check under a controlled environment."
