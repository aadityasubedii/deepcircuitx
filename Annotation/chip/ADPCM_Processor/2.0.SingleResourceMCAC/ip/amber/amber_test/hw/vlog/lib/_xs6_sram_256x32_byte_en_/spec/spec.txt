Module name: xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en.

Module specification: The xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en module is a memory structure representing a 256x32 Single Dual Port (SDP) SRAM with byte enable feature, mainly deploying the RAMB8BWER core. It performs read and write operations, determined by the i_write_enable signal. The inputs to this module include i_clk for clock signal, i_write_data (a 32-bit signal representing data to be written), i_write_enable (signal indicating whether a write operation should occur), i_address (an 8-bit signal for addressing), and i_byte_enable (a 4-bit signal controlling byte-wise write). The only output port is o_read_data which is the 32-bit result of a read operation.

Internally, the module uses 3-bit wide signals nc31, nc32, nc33, a 2-bit signal nc22 and a 4-bit signal wea. However, nc31, nc32, nc33, and nc22 seem to be unassigned. Wea signal determines the byte-wise write operation by ANDing it with 4 replicas of the write enable signal. The RAMB8BWER structure extends within the module, setting up data and address lines in SDP mode, enabling byte-wise write, and establishing the read output.

The module contains a structuring initial block where constraints for parameters DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH are executed and if not matched, corresponding warnings are displayed. This specification provides a thorough depiction of the xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en module regarding its functionality, implementation, and operation with an explicit mention of its ports and signals.
