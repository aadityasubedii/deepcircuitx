    "block_comment": "This block of code is set to always execute a timing check (\"dqs_pos_timing_check\") at the positive edge of the input signal \"dqs_in[1]\". The always block in Verilog RTL gets triggered at every positive edge of the signal, thereby checking the timing of the DQS signal. Thus, this block ensures the synchronization of digital signals within the design by reducing timing issues on the DQS line."
