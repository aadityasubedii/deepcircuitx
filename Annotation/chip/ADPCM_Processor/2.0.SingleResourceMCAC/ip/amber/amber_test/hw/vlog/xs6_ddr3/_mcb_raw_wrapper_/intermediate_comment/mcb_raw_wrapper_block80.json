    "block_comment": "This block is designed to enable the transfer of control signals and data between a processing element and the memory interface generator (MIG) when the first port is enabled. It assigns the related signals (like write clock, read clock, write enable, read enable, write mask and write data) from the processing unit to the MIG for both read and write operations. It also assigns the response signals (like read data, read full, read empty, read error, write error, read overflow, write underrun, write empty, write full, write count, and read count) from the MIG to the processing unit. The delegation of these signals allows for controlled and efficient exchange of data and control signals between the processing unit and the MIG."
