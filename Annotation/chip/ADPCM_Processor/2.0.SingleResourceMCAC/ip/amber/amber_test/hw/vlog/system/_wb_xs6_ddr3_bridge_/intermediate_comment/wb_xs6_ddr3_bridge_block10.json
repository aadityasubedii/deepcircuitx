    "block_comment": "This block of code executes a conditional assignment operation for three different signals, wb_sel, wb_dat and wb_adr. If the write buffer read signal (write_buf_r) is high, it selects the values from the buffered signals (wb_sel_buf_r, wb_dat_buf_r, wb_adr_buf_r); otherwise, if write_buf_r is low, it selects values from the default input signals (i_wb_sel, i_wb_dat, i_wb_adr). This is essentially a means of implementing selective data buffering for these signals based on the assertion of the write buffer read signal."
