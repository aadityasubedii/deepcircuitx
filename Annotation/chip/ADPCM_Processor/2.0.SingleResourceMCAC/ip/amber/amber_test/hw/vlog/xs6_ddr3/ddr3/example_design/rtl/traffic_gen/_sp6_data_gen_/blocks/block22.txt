Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is essentially a data selector. It takes an input 'data_mode_i' and, depending on the value of 'data_mode_i', shifts through different data sources. The different data sources are fixed_data_i, a combination of adata (twice), hdata, ndata, w1data (twice), a combination of prbs_data (twice), and if none matches, the default is set to binary 0 ('b0). Therefore, the code is essentially switching data based on the control signal 'data_mode_i'. This is achieved using the 'always' procedure triggered by various data signals and a case statement acting as a multiplexer for selecting which signal to assign to 'data'.
