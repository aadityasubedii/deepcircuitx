    "spec": "Module name: afifo. \n\nModule specification: The afifo module is essentially an Asynchronous First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memory implementation. Its primary functionality is to facilitate the storage of incoming data and subsequently retrieve it in the order of arrival under the control of separate read and write clocks. The key features of this module are its parameterized setup catering to variable FIFO depth and data size, and providing additional status flags to effectively monitor and manage the data flow.\n\nThe interface opens with six input ports: wr_clk, rst, rd_clk, wr_en, rd_en, and wr_data and four output ports: rd_data, full, empty, almost_full. The write and read operations are driven by independent clocks - wr_clk, and rd_clk. The wr_en and rd_en signals control the write and read mechanisms respectively when the FIFO isn't full or empty. The module accepts the data to be stored in the FIFO buffer through the wr_data port and retrieves it through the rd_data port. The status flags- full, empty, and almost_full provide the current status of the FIFO buffer. \n\nThe implementation encapsulates various internal signals each with its dedicated functionality. This includes the embodiments of the FIFO buffer as a register array named mem and the binary/Gray-encoded read/write pointers. The rd_gray_nxt, wr_gray_nxt, rd_capture_ptr, wr_capture_ptr, pre_rd_capture_gray_ptr, pre_wr_capture_gray_ptr, rd_capture_gray_ptr, wr_capture_gray_ptr, buf_avail, buf_filled, rd_strobe are the integral signals enabling the synchronization between the read and write operations. The pointers wr_addr, rd_addr, wr_ptr, rd_ptr contribute in directing the write and read operations respectively at the right location in the memory. \n\nThe code is broadly segmented into following sections: declarations and assignments; generation of read/write synchronization blocks; data writing and reading from the memory; calculation of the next Gray-encoded read/write pointers along with read/write operations; and finally, the calculation and assignment of the status signals. Each segment cumulatively facilitates the smooth operation of the asynchronous FIFO with utmost precision and synchronization while preventing any data collision and overflow/underflow scenarios.",

Its primary functionality is to facilitate the storage of incoming data and subsequently retrieve it in the order of arrival under the control of separate read and write clocks. The key features of this module are its parameterized setup catering to variable FIFO depth and data size, and providing additional status flags to effectively monitor and manage the data flow.\n\nThe interface opens with six input ports: wr_clk, rst, rd_clk, wr_en, rd_en, and wr_data and four output ports: rd_data, full, empty, almost_full. The write and read operations are driven by independent clocks - wr_clk, and rd_clk. The wr_en and rd_en signals control the write and read mechanisms respectively when the FIFO isn't full or empty. The module accepts the data to be stored in the FIFO buffer through the wr_data port and retrieves it through the rd_data port. The status flags- full, empty, and almost_full provide the current status of the FIFO buffer. \n\nThe implementation encapsulates various internal signals each with its dedicated functionality. This includes the embodiments of the FIFO buffer as a register array named mem and the binary/Gray-encoded read/write pointers. The rd_gray_nxt, wr_gray_nxt, rd_capture_ptr, wr_capture_ptr, pre_rd_capture_gray_ptr, pre_wr_capture_gray_ptr, rd_capture_gray_ptr, wr_capture_gray_ptr, buf_avail, buf_filled, rd_strobe are the integral signals enabling the synchronization between the read and write operations. The pointers wr_addr, rd_addr, wr_ptr, rd_ptr contribute in directing the write and read operations respectively at the right location in the memory. \n\nThe code is broadly segmented into following sections: declarations and assignments; generation of read/write synchronization blocks; data writing and reading from the memory; calculation of the next Gray-encoded read/write pointers along with read/write operations; and finally, the calculation and assignment of the status signals. Each segment cumulatively facilitates the smooth operation of the asynchronous FIFO with utmost precision and synchronization while preventing any data collision and overflow/underflow scenarios."
