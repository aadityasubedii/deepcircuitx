Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), handling input termination and dynamic DQS calibration. It takes inputs like UI_CLK (user interface clock), RST (reset), PLL_LOCK (PLL lock signal), and various MCB-related signals. Outputs include DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL (calibration completion), SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ (self-refresh request), and numerous MCB control signals. Internal signals include STATE (calibration state machine), P_Term and N_Term (termination values), and DQS_DELAY (DQS delay value). The module operates through several stages: initialization, RZQ/ZIO calibration, input termination, and dynamic calibration. It uses an IODRP controller for I/O operations and implements a state
