Comment: 
The block of code invokes the function `cmd_addr_timing_check` whenever there's a change in `cas_n_in`. It is used to verify the timing of command addresses. With the event-driven keyword `always`, execution is triggered whenever changes occur in `cas_n_in`. The function `cmd_addr_timing_check` is passed a static timing parameter of 2, which could represent clock cycles or an aspect of the timing specifications the logic is tested against.
