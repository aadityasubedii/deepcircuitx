    "block_comment": "This block implements a synchronous reset mechanism for the ShiftEndedSync2 flip-flop. Upon activation of the reset signal, the flip-flop ShiftEndedSync2 is cleared (set to '0'). In the presence of a positive-edge clock signal (WB_CLK_I) in the absence of a reset, the value of ShiftEndedSync1 is transferred to ShiftEndedSync2, thus achieving a shift operation for synchronous processes. The delay (#Tp) ensures the correct propagation of signals across the flip-flop."
