    "block_comment": "Without a specific Verilog RTL code block provided, I cannot generate a precise comment or summary. However, here's an example of how a possible comment for a given code might look like:\n\nExample code:\n```verilog\nmodule adder (\n  input [31:0] A,\n  input [31:0] B,\n  output reg [31:0] SUM\n);\n  always @(*) begin \n    SUM = A + B; \n  end\nendmodule\n```\n\nComment generation:\nThis block of code represents a 32-bit adder module. The adder takes two 32-bit inputs (A, B) and sums them yielding a 32-bit output (SUM). The computation is designed to happen at any change of the input signals A or B. The computation is achieved by the use of always block which is causally sensitive to all changes that occur to A and B. The final result of the addition is stored in the output register SUM."
