    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block represents an asynchronous reset line function. The reset condition arises when either the system reset signal (`sys_rst`) is asserted or the `powerup_pll_locked` signal is cleared (PLL is not locked). The \"or\" operator (`|`) is used here to logically combine these two conditions, and the complement operator (`~`) inverts the state of the `powerup_pll_locked` signal. If any of those conditions are met, `async_rst` is assigned true to enforce an asynchronous reset."
