Module-level comment: This module generates various data patterns for system-peripheral testing. It supports walking, hammer, address-based, and PRBS patterns, selectable via input modes. The module uses parameterized widths and combines different generation techniques based on the selected mode. It synchronously produces output data on each clock cycle when enabled, using internal counters and shift registers to create the desired patterns.
