    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of the `Dec_Flag` signal. Specifically, `Dec_Flag` is set to true when the value of `TARGET_DQS_DELAY` is less than the value of `DQS_DELAY`, otherwise it is false. This may suggest that the code is from a delay management module where the flag triggers certain operations when DQS delay is greater than the target delay."
