This block of code handles data multiplexing between a memory cell address register and a data register. The module uses a single line of code to select the output based on the value of the addr_data_sel_n signal. When addr_data_sel_n is true (logic 1), memcell_addr_reg is selected for output; otherwise, data_reg is selected.
