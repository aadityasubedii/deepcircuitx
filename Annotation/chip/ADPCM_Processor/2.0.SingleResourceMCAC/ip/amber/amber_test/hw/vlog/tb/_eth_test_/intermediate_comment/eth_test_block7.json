    "block_comment": "The Block calculates and updates the 'crc_din' variable used for CRC computation based on the current state of the transmission system. It selects the lower four bits (3:0) of the third memory line ('mem[line_r+3]') when the system is in TX_0 state, the higher four bits (7:4) when in the TX_1 state and assigns a default of 0 when the system is in any other state. The state-based selection mechanism implemented with the conditional operator ensures immediate update of 'crc_din'."
