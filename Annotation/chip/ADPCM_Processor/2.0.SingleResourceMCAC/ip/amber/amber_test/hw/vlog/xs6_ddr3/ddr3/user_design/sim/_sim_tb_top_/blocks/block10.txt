Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for generating a system clock signal. Specifically, it uses an 'always' block to continuously toggle the 'c3_sys_clk' signal on every half period of 'C3_MEMCLK_PERIOD'. This activity effectively creates a square wave function that can be used as a system clock. The duration of high and low states is equal, making it a perfect signal to synchronize data transfer and processing operations in the digital system.
