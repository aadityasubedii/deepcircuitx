    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code configures a data pipeline using a synchronous design on a positive edge clock signal. It begins by resetting the data-in to the starting address whenever a reset signal is detected. Following this, if the instruction is deemed valid, the pipeline input is altered based on a combination of flags and parameters, including address mode, number of data pins (DQ_PINS), and memory burst length. Key aspects of the operation involve selection and skew adjustment of the address to be propagated through the pipeline, and the transformations vary as per the hardware specifications such as DQ_PINS and burst length. The configuration embedding these nuances guarantees efficient pipeline utilization."
