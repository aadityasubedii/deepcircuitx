This block generates and maintains valid bits for cache ways under certain conditions. Initially, when a reset signal is high, the valid bits are cleared to zero. Otherwise, if the cache state is idle, it records the last valid bits of each way from the tag memory. This is done by using an always block that is sensitive to the edges of the reset and clock signal, thus providing the means for synchronous operation. The value of valid_bits_r is based on the most significant bit from each of the eight tag memory ways. The cumulative result is a vector/array that represents the valid status of each individual cache way.
