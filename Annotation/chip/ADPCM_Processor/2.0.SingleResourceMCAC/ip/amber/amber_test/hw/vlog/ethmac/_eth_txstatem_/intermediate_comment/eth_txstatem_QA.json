It manages various signal states of the communication protocol, representing different stages of the transmission frame such as Idle, IPG (Inter-Packet Gap), Preamble, Data, PAD, FCS (Frame Check Sequence), Jam, BackOff, and Defer states. Inputs to the module include clock, reset, and various fields related to the Ethernet frame, such as collision detection, under-run errors, and frame size. Outputs are mainly signals indicating the current state of the transmission and triggers for the next states. This module also includes a reset mechanism to provide a known initial state and uses positive-edge clocking to controll the synchronization of its state transitions."

These can include excessive deferral by a transmitter, carrier sensing, collision detection, under-run errors, occurrence of a transmission that's too large, collision window check, maximum retries, back-off flag, start and end of a transmission frame, and under-run detection during transmission.\n- NibCnt, IPGT, IPGR1, IPGR2: These are parameters related to the inter-frame gaps. NibCnt is the nibble count, while IPGT, IPGR1, and IPGR2 are the Inter-packet gap transmit, receive 1, and receive 2 respectively.\n- [6:0] FullD, Pad, CrcEn, NibbleMinFl, RandomEqByteCnt, MaxFrame, NibCntEq7, NibCntEq15: These inputs relate to the structure of the Ethernet frame itself. This includes full-duplex mode, padding enabled, CRC check enabled, minimum nibble flag, byte count equivalent to random, maximum frame size check, and nibble count equals to 7 and 15 check.\n\nOutput Ports:\n- StateIdle, StateIPG, StatePreamble, StateData, StatePAD, StateFCS, StateJam, StateJam_q, StateBackOff, StateDefer: These outputs indicate the current state of the Ethernet transmission data processing, going from idle, IPG, preamble, actual data, padding, check sequence, jam signal, previous jam state, back-off and deferment states.\n- StartFCS, StartJam, StartBackoff, StartDefer, DeferIndication, StartPreamble, StartData, StartIPG: These outputs indicate the start of various states in the Ethernet frame transmission stage after the current state (FCS, jam, backoff, deferment, preamble, data, IPG).\n- StartIdle, StartPAD: These are wires utilized in internal operations which mark the start of the Idle and PAD states."

It is used to control and manage the transition between deferred data packets.\n- StartIPG: This wire is used to start the Inter-Packet Gap (IPG) state. It determines when it is safe to send the next data packet.\n- StartPreamble: This wire dictates the start of the preamble state, which is an integral part of any data packet, giving the receiving device time to prepare to receive the packet.\n- StartData: This wire is used to determine the beginning of the transfer of the actual data contents of the Ethernet frame.\n- StartPAD: This wire signals when padding data is being delivered in the Ethernet frame transmission.\n- StartFCS: The start of the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) state is marked by this wire. This is used to check the integrity of the received data packet.\n- StartJam: This wire indicates the start of the Jam signal state, typically during a detected collision in half-duplex mode.\n- StartBackoff: This wire signals when the Backoff state starts, which happens when a collision is detected and the network interface needs to wait before re-sending a frame.\n- StartDefer: This wire marks the start of the Defer state, where the frame transmission is deferred due to holidays.\n- DeferIndication: This wire is used to provide a defer indication signal output during the Idle state when CarrierSense is high, indicating that the medium is busy.\n- Rule1: This is an internal control flag that is used to determine specific conditions for transitions between different states. It's particularly used to decide the inter-packet gap based on whether it's an idle state or full-duplex mode."
