This block handles the status of completion based on various conditions associated with data transmission. It gets triggered on the positive edge of either MTxClk or TxReset, resetting the transmission is done (MuxedDone) flag when either TxReset or TxStartFrmIn goes high. On the other hand, if a transmission is in progress (identified by TxDoneIn high) but not yet completed (TxDoneInLatched low) and if any output data is detected (TxUsedDataOutDetected high), MuxedDone gets set.
