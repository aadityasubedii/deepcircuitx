    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a flip-flop with a reset and clock signal enabling the functionality of deferral control in the hardware. The `DeferLatched` signal gets updated on every rising edge of `MTxClk` or `Reset`. If reset signal is detected, the `DeferLatched` is immediately set to 0. If `DeferIndication` flag is set, `DeferLatched` is set to 1 indicating deferral is requested. If `RstDeferLatched` flag is set, it signifies the request to reset deferral and hence `DeferLatched` is set to 0."
