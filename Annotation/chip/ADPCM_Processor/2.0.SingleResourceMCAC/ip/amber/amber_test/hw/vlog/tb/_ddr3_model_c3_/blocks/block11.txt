Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is intended to check the timing of a negative edge triggered signal. It does so by calling the procedure `dqs_neg_timing_check` on every positive edge of the signal `dqs_in[21]`. This method allows for continuous monitoring and analysis of the signal, effectively ensuring that the timing of the negative edge trigger is appropriate and meets the defined requirements.
