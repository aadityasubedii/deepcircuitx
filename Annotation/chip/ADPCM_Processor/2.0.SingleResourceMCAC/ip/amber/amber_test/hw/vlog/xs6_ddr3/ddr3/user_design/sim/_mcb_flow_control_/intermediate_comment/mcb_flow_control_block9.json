    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the 'wait_done' signal based on certain conditions. It gets triggered at the positive edge of the input clock 'clk_i'. If the 9th bit of 'rst_i' (reset signal) is high or if 'push_cmd_r' (push command) is active, 'wait_done' is set to 1, after the timing control specified by TCQ. If 'cmd_rdy_o' (command ready output), 'cmd_valid_i' (command valid input) are both true and if the family type is \"SPARTAN6\", then 'wait_done' is set to 0, again obeying the TCQ timing control."
