    "block_comment": "This block is a counter for the `tx_bit_count` in a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter). The counter incrementally updates at every rising edge of the `clk_uart` signal or falling edge of the `clk_uart_rst_n` signal. If the reset signal (`clk_uart_rst_n`) is low, the counter is reset to 0. When `tx_bit_count` reaches 9, it cycles back to 0. Otherwise, it just increments by 1 at each clock cycle. Hence, it modulates the transmission bit number for UART-based communication."
