This block of code handles the setting of write positive input delay for the User DQS (UDQS) in a memory control block. The delay is initialized with DQS_DELAY_INITIAL value. It sets the IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR register to the PosEdgeInDly signal and sets the IODRPCTRLR_R_WB register to WRITE_MODE, indicating that write operation is to be performed. The MCB_UIADDR register is set to IOI_UDQS_CLK, implying usage for the UDQS Clock. The MCB_CMD_VALID signal is set to 1 indicating a valid command. Depending upon the value of MCB_RDY_BUSY_N, it either stays in the same state or moves to the UDQS_WAIT1 state.
