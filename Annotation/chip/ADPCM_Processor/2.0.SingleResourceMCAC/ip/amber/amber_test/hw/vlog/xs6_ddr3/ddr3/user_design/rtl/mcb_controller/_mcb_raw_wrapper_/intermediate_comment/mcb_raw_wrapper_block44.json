    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block primarily focuses on assigning write and read signals between the user interface and memory interface controller. The implementation handles two possible interface modes: \"AXI\" mode or another (unspecified) mode. If in \"AXI\" mode, the write signals (wr_en) directly control whether each part of the data pipeline (mig_p0, mig_p1, etc.) is enabled. In non-\"AXI\" mode, the write signals, combined with a 'full' condition (wr_full), control the enable state. Furthermore, both modes also include assignments for write data (wr_data) and a write mask (wr_mask). Reading signals (rd_en) are also assigned similarly to the write signals, using a separate 'empty' condition (rd_empty)."
