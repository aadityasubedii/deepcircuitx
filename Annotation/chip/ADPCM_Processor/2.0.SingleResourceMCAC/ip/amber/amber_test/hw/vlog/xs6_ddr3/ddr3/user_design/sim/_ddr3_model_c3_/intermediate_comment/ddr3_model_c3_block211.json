    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles memory resetting and ensures timing requirements are met. On every rising edge of reset signal, it checks if the input reset signal (rst_n_in) is active. If active, it checks three conditions. Firstly, if strict timing is checked, it verifies if the simulation time is less than 200 microseconds, printing a warning if not, indicating the reset signal went inactive too soon. Secondly, CKE (Clock Enable) is checked, if it is active an error is printed, as it should be inactive when the reset signal is inactive. Lastly, it confirms if there was a 10 ns gap between CKE going inactive and reset going inactive, if not, it's flagged as an error. If `MAX_MEM` is defined, it executes related tasks; if not, it sets `memory_used` to 0."
