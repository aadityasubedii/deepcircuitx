    "block_comment": "This Verilog block performs the function of arbitration for a bus master. Depending on the state of the `current_master` variable, it assigns values from either master 0 (m0) or master 1 (m1) to the corresponding master variables - address, selector, write data, write enable, cycle, and strobe. If `current_master` is logic 1, it assigns values from master 1 (m1), otherwise it assigns from master 0 (m0). This mechanism facilitates switching between the two bus masters in a shared bus system according to the state of `current_master`."
