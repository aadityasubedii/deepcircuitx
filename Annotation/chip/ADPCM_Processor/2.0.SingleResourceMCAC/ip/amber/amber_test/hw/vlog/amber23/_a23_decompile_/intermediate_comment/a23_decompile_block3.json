    "block_comment": "The function `get_4bit_signal` extracts the 4-bit signal state. It takes a 3-bit input `num` and uses a `case` statement to decode the input. When `num` is '0', it assigns the value of `U_CACHE.i_byte_enable`, a 4-bit constant, to `get_4bit_signal`. The function does not account for inputs beyond '0'; in such cases, the `get_4bit_signal` may retain its previous value or take a random value depending upon the synthesizer."
