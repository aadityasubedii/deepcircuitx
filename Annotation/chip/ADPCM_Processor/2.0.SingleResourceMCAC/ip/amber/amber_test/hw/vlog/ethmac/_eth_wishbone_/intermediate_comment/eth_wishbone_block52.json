    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for generating a signal to write received data status (RxStatusWrite). This is achieved through a logical AND of three conditions: the ending of the shift cycle (ShiftEnded), the enable signal for received data (RxEn), and the delayed version of the enable signal for received data (RxEn_q). This ensures that the write operation to status register only happens when data is completely received and the system is ready to capture it."
