Comment: 
This line of code in Verilog is responsible for creating a ready or busy sign for a particular system based on its condition. It operates by continuously assigning the status of the system (either ready or busy) to the signal 'rdy_busy_n' based on the state of the system 'state', represented as 'READY' specifically here.
