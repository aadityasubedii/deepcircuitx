Comment: 
This Verilog block is a synchronous logic used to control and check ShortFrame flag. On the positive edge of MRxClk or the Reset signal, it updates the ShortFrame flag. When a Reset or LoadRxStatus condition is active, it sets the flag to zero but when the TakeSample condition is active, it sets the ShortFrame to high, only if RxByteCnt is less than r_MinFL. The delayed assignment to ShortFrame with the '#Tp' is used to mimic real hardware timings.
