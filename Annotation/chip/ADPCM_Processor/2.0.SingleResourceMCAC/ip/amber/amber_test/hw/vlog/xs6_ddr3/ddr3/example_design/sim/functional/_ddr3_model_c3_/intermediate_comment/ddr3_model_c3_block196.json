    "block_comment": "This block leverages a D-flip flop to sample and hold the value of \"dqs_even[12]\" at the rising edge of the clock. The function \"dqs_even_receiver\" is called with \"12\" as the input, each time there is a positive edge on the \"dqs_even[12]\". Implementation-wise, this action is noted with the \"always @ (posedge dqs_even[12])\", which signifies that the said function call is triggered by the positive edge of \"dqs_even[12]\"."
