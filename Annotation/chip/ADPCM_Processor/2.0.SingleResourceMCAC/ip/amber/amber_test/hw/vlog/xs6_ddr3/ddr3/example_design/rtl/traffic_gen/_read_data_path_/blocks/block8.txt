This block of code deals with error detection in Virtex6 family memories with burst length of 8. It specifically checks for discrepancies between incoming data and comparison data on the data-ready signal, and if inconsistencies are found, it flags an error for relevant data byte. This implementation loops over half of the data-query pins, comparing an 8-bit wide window of the input data with a corresponding window of the compared data, and assigns the result of the inequality check to the error signal for the corresponding byte.
