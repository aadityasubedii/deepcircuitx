    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for creating and writing into a file `pkt_to_amber_ack`. It handles File I/O operations. Initially, it opens the `pkt_to_amber_ack` file in write mode; following that, it writes \"0\\n\" (a zero followed by a newline character) to the `pkt_to_amber_ack` file, and then securely closes the file."
