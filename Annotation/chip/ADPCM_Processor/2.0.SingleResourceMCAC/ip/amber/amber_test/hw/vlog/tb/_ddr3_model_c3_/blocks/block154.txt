This block verifies the timing of an incoming address. The block utilises a timing check procedure called `cmd_addr_timing_check` on the 11th bit of the input address `addr_in`. The decision to conduct a check is decided based on changes in the 11th bit (`addr_in[10]`). When a change is detected in the said address bit, the procedure `cmd_addr_timing_check` is invoked with '17' as an input parameter. The exact functionality of this timing check is dependent on the implementation details of the `cmd_addr_timing_check` procedure.
