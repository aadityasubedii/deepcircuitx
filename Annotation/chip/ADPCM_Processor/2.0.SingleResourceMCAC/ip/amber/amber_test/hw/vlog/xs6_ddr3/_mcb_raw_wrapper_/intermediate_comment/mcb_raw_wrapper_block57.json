    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the read and write operations of a data transfer scheme between different memory interfaces. It consists of two main sections, the first being involved in assigning values to the control and data signals of the data transfer process. It enables/disables the process, determines the write data and mask, and handles read/write counts and status flags such as errors, full, empty, overflow, and underrun. In contrast, the second section turns off all these operations by assigning zero to all the control and flag signals, which effectively halts any ongoing data transfer at the Verilog signal level."
