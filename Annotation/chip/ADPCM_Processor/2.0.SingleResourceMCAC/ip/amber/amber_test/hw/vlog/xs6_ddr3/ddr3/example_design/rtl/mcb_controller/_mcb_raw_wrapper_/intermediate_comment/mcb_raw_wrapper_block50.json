    "block_comment": "The block of code is a conditional assignment block in Verilog, which routes signals from one set of variables (p3) to another set of variables (mig_p4 and mig_p5), or assigns zeros to those same output variables. If C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is 1, it routes command and memory associated signals. It does this via direct signal assignments (e.g., p3_arb_en to mig_p4_arb_en). Additionally, command burst length is updated with bitwise OR and concatenation operations. On the other side, if C_PORT_ENABLE[3] is 0, all mig_p4 and mig_p5 related signals are given their default values, which is 'b0."
