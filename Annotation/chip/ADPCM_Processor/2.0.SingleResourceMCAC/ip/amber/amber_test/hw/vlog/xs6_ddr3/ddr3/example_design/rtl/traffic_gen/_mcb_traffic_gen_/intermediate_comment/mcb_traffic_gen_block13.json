    "block_comment": "The block assigns the status of the MCB command buffer to a signal. This is achieved by directly assigning the value of 'mcb_cmd_full_i' signal, which denotes if the MCB command buffer is full or not, to 'cmd_full' signal. This assignment strategy allows the 'cmd_full' signal to mirror the status of the MCB command buffer in real-time."
