    "block_comment": "This block handles the transformation of input data for a pipelined system. On every positive clock edge, it checks the input signals for a reset condition, a valid instruction and the current address mode. If reset is high, it populates pipe data with the start address. If not, depending on the number of valid DQ (Data Query) pins, memory burst length, and certain conditions related to address mode, it builds the pipe data from a combination of a part of the current address and a string of '0's of particular length. It operates based on the NUM_DQ_PINS, which determines address size and bit shifting used for different memory burst lengths and address modes."
