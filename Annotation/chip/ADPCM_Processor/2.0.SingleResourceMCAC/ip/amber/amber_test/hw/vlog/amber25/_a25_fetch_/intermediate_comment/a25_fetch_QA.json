The selection between cache memory or system memory is determined by if the address is cacheable and the cache is enabled. Different output stalling conditions such as the system not ready, waiting on write-back operations, or cache stalls, are also handled inside this module. It uses inputs of addresses, data, and various control signals from the system and returns fetched instructions, write back requests and addresses (if required), and signals if a stall has occurred. This module also interfaces with the cache module 'a25_icache'."
