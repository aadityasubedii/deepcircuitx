This code block is used for signal assignment in Verilog. It assigns the value of 'wdp_validB' to the signal 'wdp_validB_o'. The 'assign' statement is used for continuous assignment which means the assigned signal ('wdp_validB_o' in this case) will take new value immediately upon any changes in operands. This is a simple one line statement with no conditional or complex implementations.
