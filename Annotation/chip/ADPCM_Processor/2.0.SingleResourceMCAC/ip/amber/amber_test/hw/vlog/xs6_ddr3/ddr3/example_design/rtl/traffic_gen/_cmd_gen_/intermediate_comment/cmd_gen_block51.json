    "block_comment": "This block of code is for generating the command clock enable signal. It assigns the `cmd_clk_en` signal using a logical combination of `rdy_i`, `pipe_out_vld`, `run_traffic_i`, `mode_load_pulse`, and comparison between `CMD_PATTERN` and `\"CGEN_BRAM\"`. If `rdy_i`, `pipe_out_vld`, and `run_traffic_i` signals are all high, or if `mode_load_pulse` is true and `CMD_PATTERN` matches `\"CGEN_BRAM\"`, then `cmd_clk_en` is set high."
