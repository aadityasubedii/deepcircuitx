    "block_comment": "The block of code handles the control flow for writing configuration data to memory controller block (MCB). It does this by setting the MCB_UIADDR to IOI_LDQS_PIN and the MCB_CMD_VALID signal to 1. Depending on the value of the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal, the system state transitions to either the LDQS_PIN_WRITE_P_TERM state or waits in the LDQS_PIN_P_TERM_WAIT state. The signal MCB_RDY_BUSY_N serves as a flag, indicating when the MCB is ready to accept commands and not busy."
