    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for assignment of the 32-bit immediate value for the next stage of instruction execution based on instruction type and sub-type. The selection is performed using a conditional ternary operator based on the type of instruction. For various instruction sub-types, the relevant segments of the `imm8` and `instruction` variables are selected and concatenated, often with zeros, to form a 32-bit word. A special case exists for `MULT` instruction types where an all-zero word is assigned. For `MTRANS` types, a constructed `mtrans_base_reg_change` value is used, while for `BRANCH` and `TRANS` types, `offset24` and `offset12` are used, respectively."
