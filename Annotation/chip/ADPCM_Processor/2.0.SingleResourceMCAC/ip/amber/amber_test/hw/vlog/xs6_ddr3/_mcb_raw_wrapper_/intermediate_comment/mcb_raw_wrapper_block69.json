    "block_comment": "This block performs assignments of various signal states and control parameters between the module-specific variables and Multi-Interface Memory Controller (MIG) variables for Port 0 and Port 1 of a memory system. If Port 1 is enabled, the block assigns control signals (like enable, clock, row address, column address, burst identifiers, and more) between the Port 1-specific variables and MIG-specific variables for effective control during memory arbitration. It also assigns both write and read related control signals and data between Port 1 and the MIG. These connections allow necessary control and data flow between the ports and the MIG controller in the memory system."
