    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generation based on the linear feedback shift register (LFSR) output. Depending on the FPGA family used, adjustments are made for PRBS generation. If the family is \"SPARTAN6\", the PRBS generation computes the bitwise OR with 'PRBS_SADDR' and bitwise AND with 'PRBS_EADDR' if their corresponding mask bits are set. Otherwise, it selects the 'lfsr_q' value. After the computation, bits up to the logarithm (base 2) of 'DWIDTH' are cleared for 'prbs'. If the family is not \"SPARTAN6\", it follows a similar procedure but operates on different initial index and bit clearance position. The summing point of these operations forms the pseudo-random sequence."
