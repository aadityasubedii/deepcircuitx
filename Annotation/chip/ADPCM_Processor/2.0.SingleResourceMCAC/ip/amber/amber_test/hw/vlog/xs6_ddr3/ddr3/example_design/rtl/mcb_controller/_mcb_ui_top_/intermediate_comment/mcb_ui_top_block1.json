    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog assumes a role of a signal definition indicating the completion of a memory controller's calibration process (`mcb_calib_done`). It is implemented by initializing a signal (`calib_done_synch`) which becomes high when the memory controller board finishes the calibration process."
