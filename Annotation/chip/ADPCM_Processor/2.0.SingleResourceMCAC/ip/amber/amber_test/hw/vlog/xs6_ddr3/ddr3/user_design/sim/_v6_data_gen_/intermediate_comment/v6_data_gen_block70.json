    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for delay sensitive data mode strobing applications. It employs a clock edge sensitive approach, where the data_mode input is sampled at every positive edge of the input clock. The sampled data values are then registered into 'data_mode_rr_a', 'data_mode_rr_b', and 'data_mode_rr_c' registers after a delay defined by the constant TCQ. These registers enable the system to hold and later use the data from 'data_mode_i' input."
