Comment: 
This Verilog code block is responsible for resetting or updating the output data based on predefined conditions. The code operates synchronously with two signal edges -- the rising edge of the Clock signal (Clk) and the positive edge of the Reset signal. If the Reset signal or the synchronous Reset (SyncReset) signal is high, the output data (DataOut) is set to a predefined reset value (RESET_VALUE) after a unit delay. Otherwise, if the Write signal is high, DataOut is updated with the value of DataIn after a unit delay.
