Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for the progressive delay of the `cmp_data` signal over four synchronous clock cycles. It uses four intermediate variables (`cmp_data_r`, `cmp_data_r2`, `cmp_data_r3`, and `cmp_data_r4`) to store the value of `cmp_data` in subsequent clock cycles. On each positive edge of the input clock (`clk_i`), it assigns the current value of `cmp_data` to `cmp_data_r` and shifts the values in the other registers by one position. This operation generates a delay corresponding to four clock cycles.
