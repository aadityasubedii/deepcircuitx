    "block_comment": "This code represents a memory self-refresh mechanism for an MCB (Memory Controller Block) triggered either by UI_CLK or RST signals. If the RST signal is received, the registers for MCB self-refresh mode (SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE_R1, SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE_R2, SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE_R3), MCB self-refresh requests (SELFREFRESH_REQ_R1, SELFREFRESH_REQ_R2, SELFREFRESH_REQ_R3) and Phase Lock Loop (PLL_LOCK_R1, PLL_LOCK_R2) are reset. Otherwise, the registers for self-refresh mode, requests, and PLL lock are sequentially updated based on their previous state. This is typically used to prevent data loss in volatile memory while power is not supplied."
