    "block_comment": "The block of code is part of a wider bus arbitration process. This block specifically routes the necessary signals to the sixth slave in the system (s6). The address, data, and selection lines are directly assigned from the master to the sixth slave. Write-enable (we), cycle (cyc), and strobe (stb) lines are conditionally assigned: they are only forwarded from the master to the sixth slave when the current_slave signal matches the sixth slave's identifier. Otherwise, they are held LOW."
