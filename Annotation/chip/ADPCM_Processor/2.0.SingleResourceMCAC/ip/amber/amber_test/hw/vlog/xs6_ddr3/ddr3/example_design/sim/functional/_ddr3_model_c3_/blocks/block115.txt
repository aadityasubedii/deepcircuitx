Comment: 
This block is initializing a process that will always monitor the 16th bit of the input data queue (dq_in[15]). When this bit changes, it then runs a timing check function (dq_timing_check) with '15' as its argument. This function presumably checks some conditions related to the operation of this particular bit in the data queue.
