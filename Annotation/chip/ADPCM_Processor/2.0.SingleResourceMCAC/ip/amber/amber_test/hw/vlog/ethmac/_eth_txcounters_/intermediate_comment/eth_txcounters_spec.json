    "spec": "Module name: eth_txcounters. \n\nModule specification: The eth_txcounters module is a critical component designed for Ethernet transmission operations, managing the counting of nibbles and bytes of transmitted data. It identifies when the minimum and maximum frame length have been met and handles conditions such as excessive deferring. Its operation is driven by various state inputs, flags, and registers. \n\nThe inputs to the module mainly include various state signals such as StatePreamble, StateIPG, StateData, StatePAD, etc., control signals like TxStartFrm, MinFL, MaxFL, and certain enabling flags like HugEn and ExDfrEn among others. Functionally, these inputs control different states of Ethernet transmission process and provide necessary information such as minimum, maximum frame lengths and certain enabling conditions. \n\nThe outputs include ByteCnt and NibCnt that are the counts of transmitted bytes and nibbles respectively, signals indicating specific conditions such as ExcessiveDefer, NibCntEq7, NibCntEq15, and MaxFrame, and a counter DlyCrcCnt keeping track of Delayed CRC count.\n\nInternal signals used in the module include ExcessiveDeferCnt, ResetNibCnt, IncrementNibCnt, ResetByteCnt, IncrementByteCnt, and ByteCntMax. These signals are deployed to control the counters incrementation and resetting, detect excessive deferring, and identify when the maximum byte count has been reached.\n\nThe code is divided into certain blocks focusing on different functionalities. There are blocks for the incrementation and resetting of the NibCnt and ByteCnt controlled by the internal wire signals. Another block is dedicated to conditionally actuate the 'ExcessiveDefer' signal. Boolean checks for many conditions like Nibble count being equivalent to certain numbers, Byte Count reaching the Maximum Frame Length, and existence of \"huge frame\" and excessive deferral are performed. The module also contains block for maintaining a Delayed CRC count. \n\nThe eth_txcounters module hence presents a well-organized, parameter-regulated layout for managing Ethernet data transmission metrics.",

It serves as a part of the condition to set the 'ExcessiveDefer' output signal. \n\n2. ResetNibCnt: This is a wire which gets asserted when the condition to reset the Nibble Count is met, such as: StateDefer & ExcessiveDefer & ~TxStartFrm, etc. When the system is in these states, it indicates that the nibble count should be reset. \n\n3. IncrementNibCnt: This wire is driven high to increment the Nibble Count (NibCnt) when the system is in specific states like StateIPG, StatePreamble, etc. and also if TxStartFrm is high and there is no excessive defer.\n\n4. ResetByteCnt: Similar to ResetNibCnt, this wire gets asserted when system should reset the Byte Count (ByteCnt). This happens under specific conditions such as the beginning of backoff period, the idle state when a new frame transmission starts, or when the packet transmission finishes.\n\n5.

It identifies when the minimum and maximum frame length have been met and handles conditions such as excessive deferring. Its operation is driven by various state inputs, flags, and registers. \n\nThe inputs to the module mainly include various state signals such as StatePreamble, StateIPG, StateData, StatePAD, etc., control signals like TxStartFrm, MinFL, MaxFL, and certain enabling flags like HugEn and ExDfrEn among others. Functionally, these inputs control different states of Ethernet transmission process and provide necessary information such as minimum, maximum frame lengths and certain enabling conditions. \n\nThe outputs include ByteCnt and NibCnt that are the counts of transmitted bytes and nibbles respectively, signals indicating specific conditions such as ExcessiveDefer, NibCntEq7, NibCntEq15, and MaxFrame, and a counter DlyCrcCnt keeping track of Delayed CRC count.\n\nInternal signals used in the module include ExcessiveDeferCnt, ResetNibCnt, IncrementNibCnt, ResetByteCnt, IncrementByteCnt, and ByteCntMax. These signals are deployed to control the counters incrementation and resetting, detect excessive deferring, and identify when the maximum byte count has been reached.\n\nThe code is divided into certain blocks focusing on different functionalities. There are blocks for the incrementation and resetting of the NibCnt and ByteCnt controlled by the internal wire signals. Another block is dedicated to conditionally actuate the 'ExcessiveDefer' signal. Boolean checks for many conditions like Nibble count being equivalent to certain numbers, Byte Count reaching the Maximum Frame Length, and existence of \"huge frame\" and excessive deferral are performed. The module also contains block for maintaining a Delayed CRC count. \n\nThe eth_txcounters module hence presents a well-organized, parameter-regulated layout for managing Ethernet data transmission metrics."
