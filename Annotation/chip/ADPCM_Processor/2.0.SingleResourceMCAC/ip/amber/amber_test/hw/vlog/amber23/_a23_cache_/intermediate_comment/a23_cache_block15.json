    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for a four-way method selection - if the `WAYS` variable equals to 4 (`WAYS == 4`), which triggers this `pick_way_4ways` block. The function being used, `pick_way`, chooses method/configuration based on the current value of the `valid_bits_r` and `random_num` variables. Hence, the purpose of block is to make a decision operation driven by existing parameters about which method or configuration to proceed with."
