    "block_comment": "This block of code determines the validity of the data read path based on the family and memory blend of the FPGA. It uses conditional logic for the validation, if the FPGA belongs to the family \"VIRTEX6\" and has a memory blend \"MEM_BLEN\" of 4, it checks whether the read data FIFO is not empty and the almost full flag is set. Otherwise, it validates the path simply by checking whether the MCB read FIFO is not empty."
