    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for invoking the `dm_timing_check` function whenever there is a change in the 8th bit (`dm_in[7]`) of the `dm_in` input. This feature is an integral part of enabling event-driven simulations in Verilog where an action is performed based upon changes in a signal or set of signals. Notably, the execution here uses `always @`, an event control statement in Verilog, which executes the subsequent block whenever the signals in the sensitivity list change, effectively monitoring the 8th bit of `dm_in` and calling the `dm_timing_check` function accordingly."
