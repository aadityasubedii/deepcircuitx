    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for determining when to activate certain bytes during an operation. The implementation involves bitwise operations and comparisons with the 'BitCounter'. ByteSelect[0] is activated initially. However, if data preloading is deactivated, it is activated when the 'BitCounter' hits 0. If preloading is on, it's activated when the 'BitCounter' hits 32. ByteSelect[1] is activated when the 'BitCounter' hits 40. Lastly, ByteSelect[2] and ByteSelect[3] are both activated during write operations when the 'BitCounter' reach 48 and 56 respectively."
