    "block_comment": "This block of code is implementing a timing check for command address. It does so by calling the function `cmd_addr_timing_check` with argument `0` whenever there's a change in the value of `cs_n_in`, indicating use in synchronous designs with respect to changes in the system clock or input signal."
