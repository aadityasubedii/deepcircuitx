    "block_comment": "This block assigns various outputs related to read/write operations in a memory interface generator (MIG). Outputs include write data, write mask, and control flags, which are derived from specific bits of their respective input data. Furthermore, enable signals for MIG paths are dependent on the read enable signal and the user interface mode. It features checks for various error scenarios including write errors, underflows, read overflows, and full conditions. Additionally, there are status checks for command full and empty conditions."
