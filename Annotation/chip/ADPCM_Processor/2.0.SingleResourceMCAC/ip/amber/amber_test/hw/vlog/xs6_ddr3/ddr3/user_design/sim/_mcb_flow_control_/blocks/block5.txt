This block is responsible for controlling the state of the write command pending flag (cmd_wr_pending_r1). It updates the flag based on conditions of system reset (rst_i[0]), last word written (last_word_wr_i), and push command (push_cmd). If system reset is active, the write command pending flag is cleared. Otherwise the flag is set when the last word has been written or reset if a command is pushed. The delay control '#TCQ' is used to simulate the propagation delay in the actual hardware implementation.
