    "module": "Module-level comment: This is the clocks_resets module. It manages system clock and reset signal generation by receiving board's clock and reset signals (i_brd_rst, i_brd_clk_n and i_brd_clk_p) and DDR calibration completion signal (i_ddr_calib_done) as inputs. Depending on the specific FPGA hardware (Xilinx Spartan6 or Virtex6), it uses PLL_ADV or MMCM_ADV to multiply the clock signal and synchronize reset signals to ensure steady operations across the system. If there's no Xilinx FPGA, a behavioral model simulates these tasks. The outputs are the system clock (o_sys_clk), reset signal (o_sys_rst), and a 200 MHz clock signal (o_clk_200)."
