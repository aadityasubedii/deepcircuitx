This block triggers a timing check function every time there's a positive edge detection in the 21st bit of the input array `dqs_in`. It uses the always@ construct to carry out event-driven procedure on edge transitions in the digital sense for verifying timing accuracy. The function `dqs_neg_timing_check` is invoked with the argument 20, likely referring to the index of interest for said timing check.
