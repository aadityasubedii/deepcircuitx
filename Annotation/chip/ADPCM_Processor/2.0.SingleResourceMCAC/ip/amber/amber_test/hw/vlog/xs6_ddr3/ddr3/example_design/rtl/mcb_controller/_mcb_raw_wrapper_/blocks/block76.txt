Comment: 
The block of code performs error checking on port 2's commands. If the conditions are fulfilled that the port is configured for read only(R32 defined in C_PORT_CONFIG[119:96]) and a command enabling sign (p2_cmd_en) is received, and if the command instuctions p2_cmd_instr[2] and p2_cmd_instr[0] are both not set, then it displays an error message to indicate an invalid command for read-only port 2, and terminates the execution.
