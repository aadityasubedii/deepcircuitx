    "block_comment": "This block executes instructions based on `itype` and `opcode` values. Detailed conditions, such as the combination of `execute_instruction` bits, `itype`, and `opcode`, are explicitly defined to select the associated instruction string. For instance, if `itype` is `REGOP` and `opcode` is `ADC`, then `xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE` assigns \"adc\" as its value. In absence of any match, it assigns \"unkow\" as the default value."
