    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for a boot memory initialization process in system reset. When the system reset occurs, it loads the boot memory from a specified file. The function 'hex_chars_to_32bits' translates hexadecimal characters into 32-bit numbers. The 'fgets' function reads one line at a time from the file and each time it checks the line address and data. If no errors occur, the boot memory address is set and depending on the system configuration either the boot memory is updated with 128 bit or 32-bit data. If there is a format error in the boot memory file, the error message will be shown. At the end, the number of successfully read lines is displayed, and some system log information like, core model, log file name, system timeout, and test name are prepared and added to a log file."
