    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for triggering a specific functionality if certain conditions are met. When the `PRBS_CMD` equals \"ADDRESS\" and `PRBS_WIDTH` equals 32, the contained logic is instantiated under the label `gen32_taps`. This instance is always triggered at the rising edge of the `clk_i` input signal, meaning it is a synchronous process."
