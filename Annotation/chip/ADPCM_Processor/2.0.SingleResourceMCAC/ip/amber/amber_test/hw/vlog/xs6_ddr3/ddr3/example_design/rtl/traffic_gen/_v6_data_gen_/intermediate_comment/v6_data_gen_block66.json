    "block_comment": "This block controls the values of eight shift registers, and one blank register, based on the mode of data input or a reset input. The values are either predefined hexcodes if the data_mode_i is 3'b101 or 3'b100 or when a reset signal (rst_i) occurs, otherwise, they are set to their complements. As a result, this block carries out a conditional reset/update of these registers, providing flexibility in shifting data depending on the selected mode or a reset request."
