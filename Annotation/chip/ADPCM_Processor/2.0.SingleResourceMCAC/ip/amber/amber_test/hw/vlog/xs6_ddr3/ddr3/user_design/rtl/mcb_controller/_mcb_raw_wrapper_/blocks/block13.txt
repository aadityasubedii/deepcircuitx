The block of code creates a set of output buffers (OBUFT) for each bit of an address line in a memory controller. This is enacted through a generate-for loop which cycles through each value from zero to the maximum width of the memory address bus minus one. In each iteration, an instance of an output buffer for address line is generated. The input to the buffer is from a bit in the 'ioi_addr' vector, the output control of the buffer is driven by a bit in the 't_addr' vector, and the output is connected to a corresponding bit in the 'mcbx_dram_addr' vector.
