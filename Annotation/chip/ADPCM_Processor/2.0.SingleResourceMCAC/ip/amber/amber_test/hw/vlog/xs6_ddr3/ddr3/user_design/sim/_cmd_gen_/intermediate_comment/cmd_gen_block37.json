    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to load and register a mode configuration on a rising edge of the clock input (clk_i). When the 'mode_load_pulse' condition is met (presumably when it is HIGH), the input mode 'bl_mode_i' becomes latched into the 'bl_mode_reg' register. In addition, the input 'mode_load_i' is registered and propagated through a two-stage delay pipeline 'mode_load_d1' and 'mode_load_d2'. The propagation delay in every step is defined by 'TCQ'."
