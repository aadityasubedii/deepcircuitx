Comment: 
This block of code controls the state of the CKE_Train signal in a synchronous digital system. Its function is to reset the CKE_Train signal to low or false (0) when a reset (RST) occurs. The block gets triggered each time there's a change on the RST signal and sets the CKE_Train signal to 0. This is a common practice in hardware design to ensure systems begin from a known state during a reset or system initialization.
