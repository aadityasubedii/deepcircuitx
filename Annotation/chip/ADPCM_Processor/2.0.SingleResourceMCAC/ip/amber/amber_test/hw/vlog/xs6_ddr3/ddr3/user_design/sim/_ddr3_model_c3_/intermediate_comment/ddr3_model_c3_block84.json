    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code triggers a procedure called 'dq_timing_check', every time there's a change at input 'dq_in' at bit position 46. The 'always' keyword in this instance ensures that the procedure executes whenever the specific bit value of 'dq_in' changes. This mechanism allows for accurate timing control checks for the specific bit of the data input."
