This block of code generates signals indicating the completion of a 200 microsecond waiting period. It implements this by keeping track of a wait counter (`wait_200us_counter`). When the 14th and 13th bits of the counter are both high, it signifies that 200 microseconds have passed, and therefore sets the `wait_200us_done_r1` signal to 1. On the following clock cycle, this value is latched into the `wait_200us_done_r2` register, ensuring the signal's stability for interested downstream logic blocks.
