This block implements data and control path wiring for data (DQ), data strobe (DQS), upper data mask (UDM), and lower data mask (LDM) pins in a memory controller block. It uses the IODRP2_MCB module as the primary building block. Each instance of IODRP2_MCB corresponds to a specific DQ/DQS/UDM/LDM pin and provides delay adjustment (+ or -) to align data and strobe signals with the system clock signal for reliable data transfer. Each IODRP2_MCB instance operates in either MASTER or SLAVE mode and is parameterized by attributes such as data rate, delay, MCB address, and tap delay value. Instances are also connected via combinational paths for IP communication (e.g., 'AUXSDOIN'). This Verilog RTL code also checks and applies these configurations if the number of DQ pins defined is 8.
