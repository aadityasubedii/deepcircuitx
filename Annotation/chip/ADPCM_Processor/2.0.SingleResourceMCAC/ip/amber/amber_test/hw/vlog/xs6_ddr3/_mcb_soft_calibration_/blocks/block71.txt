This block manages the self-refresh request of an MCB (Memory Controller Block) based on different conditions. It is clocked by UI_CLK and reset by the RST line. When either the PLL_LOCK_R2 is on and SELFREFRESH_REQ_R3 is off, or when RST is activated, the SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ line turns off, cancelling any previous self-refresh request. However, if the condition of the system is set to START_DYN_CAL and SELFREFRESH_REQ_R3 is on, SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ becomes active indicating the system is in self-refresh mode.
