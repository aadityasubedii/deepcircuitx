This block of code is indicating the signal assignment. In this particular line of code, the output signal 'cmd_rdy_o' is getting assigned the value of an intermediate or input signal 'cmd_rdy'. This simple assignment can be used to connect modules in the higher-level design or for signal buffering/resynchronization and other purposes. The functionality can be understood as simple routing, passing the signal from one part of the design to another. The implementation is direct signal assignment, it doesn't involve any decision-making operations or data processing, making it straightforward and light on hardware resources.
