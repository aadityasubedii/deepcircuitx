    "block_comment": "This function calculates the number of time slots required for a system based on input port configurations (`port_config`) and which ports are enabled (`port_enable`). It initializes a count (`num_ports`) to zero, then loops over the binary `port_enable` array, incrementing the count for each enabled port. Finally, it assigns 10 time slots if only one port is enabled and all five ports are used, otherwise assigns 12 time slots."
