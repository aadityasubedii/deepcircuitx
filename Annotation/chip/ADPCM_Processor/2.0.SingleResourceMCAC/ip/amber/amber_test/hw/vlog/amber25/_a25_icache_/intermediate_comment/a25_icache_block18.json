    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for deciding the next direction in a 2-way set-associative cache ('pick_way_2ways'). If the parameter 'WAYS' is set to 2, this block produces the 'next_way' assignment using the 'pick_way' function which takes the 'valid_bits_r' register and 'random_num' value as arguments. The 'pick_way' function is used to select which way or path will be chosen next based on the valid bits and a given random number."
