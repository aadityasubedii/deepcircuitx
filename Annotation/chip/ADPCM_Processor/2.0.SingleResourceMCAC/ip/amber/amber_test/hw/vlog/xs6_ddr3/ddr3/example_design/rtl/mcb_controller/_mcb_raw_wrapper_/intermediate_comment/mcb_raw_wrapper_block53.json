    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for controlling the memory interface generator (MIG) behavior based on the configuration (\"B32_B32_B32_B32\") and port enable status. When port 0 is enabled (C_PORT_ENABLE[0] == 1'b1), the respective MIG ports are assigned specific signals from the specified p0 signals, else, all MIG ports are assigned binary 0s, effectively disabling them. The block also manages read and write enable signals, data, clocks, and count signals similarly."
