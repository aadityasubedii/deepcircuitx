This block controls the initiation of a pointer read operation in a receiver module. The "StartRxPointerRead" signal gets assigned with the logical AND operation of "RxBDRead" (indicates a read request) and "RxBDReady" (indicates readiness of the receiver Block Descriptor). Hence, the reading operation commences only when both a read request is active and the receiver Block Descriptor is ready.
