    "block_comment": "The block of code utilizes an output buffer with 3-state control ('OBUFT') to manipulate the CAS (Column Address Strobe) signal used in memory operations. The buffer controls the interface with the memory controller block X-dram ('mcbx_dram_cas_n') and takes input from the internal CAS logic ('ioi_cas' signal). Furthermore, the tristate control of the signal flow is managed by the control signal 't_cas'."
