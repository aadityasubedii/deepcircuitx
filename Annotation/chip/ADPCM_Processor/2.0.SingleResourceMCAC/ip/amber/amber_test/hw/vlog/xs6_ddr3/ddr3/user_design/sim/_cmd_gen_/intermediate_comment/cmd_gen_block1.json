    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block updates the bit length (prbs_brlen) of a Pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) based on the chosen FPGA family type and input bit length (prbs_bl). When the family type is SPARTAN6 and the input bit length is 0, it corrects the bit length to 1, otherwise, it maintains the original bit length. For other family types, it sets the bit length to 2. This is accomplished using conditional statements and bit manipulation operators, allowing dynamic control of the PRBS bit length."
