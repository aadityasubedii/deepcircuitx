Module name: generic_sram_byte_en. 

Module specification: The 'generic_sram_byte_en' is a Verilog module representing a byte-enabled generic Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). It is designed to accept inputs for write data ('i_write_data'), write enable ('i_write_enable'), memory address ('i_address'), and byte enable signals ('i_byte_enable'). The write data is written into the specified memory address if write enable is asserted. The byte enable signal is used to enable which byte to write. The module outputs the data located at the memory address in each clock cycle if the write enable is not asserted. 

The module has input ports like 'reset', 'clk', 'test_mode', 'scan_enable', and 'scan_in[0-4]' for performing resets, taking clock signals, performing tests, scanning inputs respectively. It also has output ports 'scan_out[0-4]' and 'o_read_data' for scanning outputs and reading formatted data. The scan signals are specifically used for test mode operations.

Internally, the module uses the 'mem' array to represent stored data, and 'i' and 'j' as integers to serve as indices during write operations and memory initialization respectively. 

The code is divided into several sections. The reset comparator section resets the memory. The test mode section enables test functionalities. The data writing section writes the input data into an appropriate place in the memory. The data reading section reads and formulates the data from the memory to be outputted. All operations are executed synchronously with respect to the rising edge of the clock signal.
