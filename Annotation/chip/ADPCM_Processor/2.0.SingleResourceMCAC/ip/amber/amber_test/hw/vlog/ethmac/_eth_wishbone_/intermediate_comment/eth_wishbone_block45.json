    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block defines the operation of a data latch (RxDataLatched2) in a register transfer level design. On receiving a positive edge clock signal (MRxClk) or a reset signal (Reset), the block either resets the latch to zero or shifts data into it depending on the state of other control signals. If SetWriteRxDataToFifo is true and ShiftWillEnd is false, the latch is loaded with the concatenated values of the shifted RxDataLatched1 and RxData. If both SetWriteRxDataToFifo and ShiftWillEnd are true, RxDataLatched2 is assigned different values based on the value of RxValidBytes, with RxDataLatched1 being shifted appropriately and padding zeroes added at the end."
