    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional code generation block for a specific FPGA family (Spartan6). If the FPGA family is Spartan6, the specific code block named INC_COUNTS_S is generated and used in the synthesis. This approach allows the designer to leverage the specific features or accommodate incompatibilities in Spartan6 devices. If the FPGA family is not Spartan6, this block won't be synthesized into the final design."
