Comment: 
The block performs two primary functions: assigning output program counter (o_pc) and assigning output register (o_rm). The output program counter is directly passed from the input r15_out_rn. As for the output register assignment, the value is determined by the 4-bit input selector i_rm_sel. The selector acts as an index to choose the corresponding register output from r0_out to r15_out_rm. The selected register output is then assigned to o_rm.
