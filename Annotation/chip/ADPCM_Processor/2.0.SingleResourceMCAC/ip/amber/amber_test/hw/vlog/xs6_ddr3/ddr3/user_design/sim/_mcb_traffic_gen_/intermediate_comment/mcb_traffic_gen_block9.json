    "block_comment": "This expression is a simple Boolean assignment statement that enables the 'cmd_rd_en' signal. 'cmd_rd_en' is activated only when the memory controller buffer ('mcb') is not full as indicated by the 'mcb_cmd_full_i' signal and simultaneously, the 'mcb_cmd_en_o' signal is high. This statement ensures that read commands are only enabled when there is sufficient space in the buffer."
