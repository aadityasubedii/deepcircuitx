    "block_comment": "This code block triggers a write process to the `wb_start_read_d1` register. The process is clock driven and executes at the rising edge (`posedge`) of the `i_clk` signal. Precisely, every time `i_clk` transitions from low to high, the current value of `wb_start_read` is written into `wb_start_read_d1`."
