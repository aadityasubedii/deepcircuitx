The code block handles the synchronization of the start of a reception frame in a communication system. The block works based on the rising edge of either the system clock (WB_CLK_I) or a reset signal. If a reset signal is encountered, the SyncRxStartFrm variable is set to 0, effectively not starting the reception frame, and this takes place over a propagation delay denoted as Tp. If a latched start frame signal (LatchedRxStartFrm) is encountered and there's no reset, the SyncRxStartFrm is set to 1, signaling the start of a reception frame after the same propagation delay. If none of these conditions is met, SyncRxStartFrm is set to 0, keeping the reception frame off.
