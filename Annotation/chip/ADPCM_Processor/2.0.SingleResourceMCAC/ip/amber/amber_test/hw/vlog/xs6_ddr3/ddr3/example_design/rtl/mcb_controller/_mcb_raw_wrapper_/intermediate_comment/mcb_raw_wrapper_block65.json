    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a conditional assignment block that handles the assignment of signals for a Memory Interface Generator (MIG) peripheral. If the condition before this block is true, the block assigns various system signals (like arb_en, cmd_clk, cmd_en, cmd_ra, cmd_ba, cmd_ca, cmd_instr, and cmd_bl) to corresponding MIG signals. In particular, the cmd_bl signal assignment involves a bit-wise OR operation and concatenation, which implies a specific form of bit manipulation. If the preceding condition is false, this block sets the same signals to binary 0, effectively resetting or disabling these features in the MIG peripheral."
