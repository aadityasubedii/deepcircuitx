The block handles data reassignment for a memory burst length of 8 in the memory interface. It redistributes the data held in the w1data wire array across different partitions maintaining the same timing (#TCQ). Every w1data partition is reallocated with the last four bits of its own former data and the last bit of the preceding partition's data, effectively performing a kind of shift operation within and between each partition.
