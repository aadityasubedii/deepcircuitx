    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronous reset mechanism for the reception validity flags \"RxValid_d\" and \"RxValid\". On the positive edge of the MRxClk clock signal or the active Reset, the conditional statements are evaluated. When \"Reset\" is high, both \"RxValid_d\" and \"RxValid\" are asynchronously set to 0, effectively invalidating them. If \"Reset\" is low, \"RxValid_d\" and \"RxValid\" take on the value of \"GenerateRxValid\" and \"RxValid_d\" respectively, acting as delay elements for each clock cycle."
