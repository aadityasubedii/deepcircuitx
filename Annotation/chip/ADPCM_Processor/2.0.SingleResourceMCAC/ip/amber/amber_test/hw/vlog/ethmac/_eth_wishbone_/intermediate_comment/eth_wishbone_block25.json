    "block_comment": "The function of this block of code is to control the signal `RxAbortSync1` based on the system clock `WB_CLK_I` or reset input `Reset`. This is achieved by synchronously monitoring the rising edge (`posedge`) of either `WB_CLK_I` or `Reset`. When `Reset` is high, `RxAbortSync1` is set to 0 after a predefined propagation delay (`#Tp`). If `Reset` is not high, then `RxAbortSync1` is set to the value of `RxAbortLatched` after the same propagation delay. This serves to synchronize the `RxAbort` signal with the system clock and reset operations while also adding a delay for timing considerations."
