It appears to consist of several child modules including a fetch, decode, execute, memory, write-back, wishbone interface, and coprocessor. These modules suggest that this is a five-stage pipeline CPU which follow a fetch-decode-execute-memory-write_back sequence, which is typical architecture for RISC CPUs like ARM. The wishbone module suggests the use of a standard bus architecture for interfacing with memory and I/O systems. The presence of a co-processor module indicates that it supports additional parallel processing for specific tasks. The core also has functionalities for cache management as identified by signals for cache enable, flush and cacheable area. It also takes into consideration features like interrupts and exception handling."
