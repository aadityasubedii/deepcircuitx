Comment: 
The block of code manages the power-up sequence for a phase-locked loop (PLL). This is done by checking system reset signal and PLL lock state. Upon a reset condition, the powerup_pll_locked signal is set to '0' to indicate that the PLL is not in a locked state. However, when the PLL is locked detected by bufpll_mcb_locked signal, the powerup_pll_locked is set to '1' indicating the PLL is locked and the power-up process is completed.
