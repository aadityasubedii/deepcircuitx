Module-level comment: The rd_data_gen module generates memory read commands and controls signal output for FPGA families, SPARTAN6, and VIRTEX6. It operates through multiple input ports and provides command readiness, last word, data validity, user burst count equals one, and the read data as outputs. Internally, the module works with a variety of signals for control and synchronization of operations. The design involves the generation of pseudo-random or fixed pattern data, command start signals, setting/addressing user burst length, handling command readiness, and ensuring data validity. Specific data generating modules for SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 FPGAs are instantiated based on the input parameter FAMILY. The module operates on a command-validation scheme, checks the readiness of data items before processing them, and ensures synchronized operation under the FPGA clock input.
