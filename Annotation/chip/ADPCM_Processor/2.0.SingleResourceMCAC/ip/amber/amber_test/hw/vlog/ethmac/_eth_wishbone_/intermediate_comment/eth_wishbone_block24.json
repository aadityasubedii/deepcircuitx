    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a synchronous reset mechanism for the variable `RxAbortSync2`. When the positive edge of the input `WB_CLK_I` or `Reset` occurs, the block checks if the `Reset` is active. If it is, `RxAbortSync2` is reset (set to 0). If the `Reset` is not active, `RxAbortSync2` follows the value of `RxAbortSync1`. This design ensures part of the system can be reset immediately when the `Reset` signal is present, providing a certain degree of control over the system state."
