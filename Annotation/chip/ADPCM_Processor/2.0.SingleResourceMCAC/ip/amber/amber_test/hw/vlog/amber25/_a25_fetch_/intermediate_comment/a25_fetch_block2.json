    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code acts as a flip-flop for the `wb_req_r` signal with synchronous reset functionality. It is triggered on the positive edge of either the `reset` or `clk` signals. At the start of `reset`, the code block resets the `wb_req_r` signal to an idle state. During each clock cycle, if `reset` is not active, the `wb_req_r` signal is updated based on the status of `o_wb_req` and `i_wb_ready`. More specifically, if `o_wb_req` is high and `i_wb_ready` is low, `wb_req_r` is set to 1; otherwise, it's set to 0."
