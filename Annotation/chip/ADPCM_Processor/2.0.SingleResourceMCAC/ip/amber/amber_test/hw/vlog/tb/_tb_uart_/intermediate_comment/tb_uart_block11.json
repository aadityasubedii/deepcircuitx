    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating the UART status register in the test module. The implementation does this using a procedural block (`always`) that gets executed whenever there's a change in the defined signals. It sets the last two bits of the `tb_uart_status_reg` storage in `U_TEST_MODULE` with the current status of the transmit FIFO, indicating if it's full or empty (represented by `txfifo_full` and `txfifo_empty` respectively)."
