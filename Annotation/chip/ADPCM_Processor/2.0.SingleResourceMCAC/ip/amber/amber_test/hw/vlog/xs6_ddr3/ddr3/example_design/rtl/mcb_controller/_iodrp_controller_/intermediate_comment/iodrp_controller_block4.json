    "block_comment": "This block handles the Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) control signals according to the current state of the system. It activates the control signals DRP_ADD and DRP_CS when the system is in the ADDR_PHASE or DATA_PHASE. Additionally, it sets the DRP_BKST signal based on the use_broadcast condition when the state is READY. The control logic is clocked with the positive edge of the DRP_CLK signal."
