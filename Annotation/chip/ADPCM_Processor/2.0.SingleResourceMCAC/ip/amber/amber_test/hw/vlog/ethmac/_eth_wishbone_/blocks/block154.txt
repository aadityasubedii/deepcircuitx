Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is used to enable the control signal of a Random Access Memory (RAM) module. The 'assign' statement in Verilog signifies a continuous assignment which constantly assigns the value on the right (in this case, a single bit of value 1, represented as 1'b1) to the variable on the left (in this case, ram_ce). As a result, the control signal for the RAM is consistently kept enabled, allowing ongoing read or write operations.
