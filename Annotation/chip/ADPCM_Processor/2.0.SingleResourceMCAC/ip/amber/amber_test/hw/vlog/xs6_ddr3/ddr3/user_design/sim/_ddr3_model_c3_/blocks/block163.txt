The block of code is employed to monitor any changes in the bit 1 of `addr_in` and accordingly trigger the function `cmd_addr_timing_check( 8)`. The `always @` construct is an event control. In this block of code, it triggers an event whenever there is a change (rise or fall) in bit 1 of `addr_in`. Upon triggering, the function `cmd_addr_timing_check` is called with `8` as argument which might serve to impose a check or adjustment on the timing of operations based on the address changes.
