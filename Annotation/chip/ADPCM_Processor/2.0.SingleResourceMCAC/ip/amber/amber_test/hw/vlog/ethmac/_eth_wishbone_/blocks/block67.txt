This block of code is a synchronous logic which acts upon rising-edge of signals, specifically the 'WB_CLK_I' clock signal or 'Reset' signal. If the Reset is high then 'TxDone_wb' is set to zero with a certain propagation delay specified by '#Tp'; otherwise, on the next positive edge of 'WB_CLK_I', 'TxDone_wb' takes the value of 'TxDoneSync1' again with a delay of '#Tp'.
