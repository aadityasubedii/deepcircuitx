This block checks for a configuration error in the traffic generator logic for memory access. More specifically, it checks if the memory burst length (MEM_BURST_LEN) is not set to either 4 or 8. If the check is true, it prompts the user that the current logic does not support "On The Fly" (OTF) Burst mode and mentions that if memory is set to OTF, the traffic generator only generates BL8 traffic. This is implemented using an 'if' condition within an 'initial' block to check against the permissible burst lengths. The $display commands are used to display the warning/error messages as needed.
