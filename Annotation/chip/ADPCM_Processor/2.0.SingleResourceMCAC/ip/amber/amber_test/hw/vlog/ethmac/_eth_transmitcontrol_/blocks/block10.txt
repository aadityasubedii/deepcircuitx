Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is responsible for conditional increment of a delay CRC counter (`DlyCrcCnt`). The increment occurs when `CtrlMux`, `TxUsedDataIn` are true, and the third bit in the binary sequence `DlyCrcCnt` is false. This operation bitwise ANDs these signals (`CtrlMux`, `TxUsedDataIn`, and logical NOT of `DlyCrcCnt[2]`) together to update `IncrementDlyCrcCnt`.
