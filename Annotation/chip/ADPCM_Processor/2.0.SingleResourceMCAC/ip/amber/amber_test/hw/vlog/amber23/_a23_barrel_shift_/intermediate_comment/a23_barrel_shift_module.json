    "module": "Module-level comment: The a23_barrel_shift module performs different shift operations (LSL, LSR, ASR, ROR) on a 32-bit input \"i_in\" as per the function selected in \"i_function\". The shift count is decided by \"i_shift_amount\", with an immediate zero output provision controlled by \"i_shift_imm_zero\". Five inputs and two outputs manage data flow. Internally, four 33-bit signals (\"lsl_out\", \"lsr_out\", \"asr_out\", \"ror_out\") capture immediate shift results, determined by a case selector block. The final output and carry signal are produced based on the chosen operation."
