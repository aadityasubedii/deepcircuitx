Comment: 
This block of code primarily functions as a synchronous reset for the variables 'RxAbortRst_sync1' and 'RxAbortRst'. This happens when a rising edge is detected on 'wb_rst_i' or 'mrx_clk_pad_i'. During the reset phase, both 'RxAbortRst_sync1' and 'RxAbortRst' are initialized to zero. In the absence of a reset, the variables 'RxAbortRst_sync1' and 'RxAbortRst' are assigned the values of 'RxAbort_wb' and 'RxAbortRst_sync1' respectively, with transmission propagation delay '#Tp'. This block provides a fail-safe reset mechanism for the specified variables while also updating them according to the 'RxAbort_wb' signal during normal functionality.
