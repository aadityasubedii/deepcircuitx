This block generates a signal called "rx_fifo_pop_not_empty." It does so by combining two conditions: the "rx_fifo_pop" condition and the not condition of "rx_fifo_empty." This ensures that the "rx_fifo_pop_not_empty" signal is only high when the FIFO is not empty and an item is being popped from the FIFO. The logic is implemented using basic binary operators.
