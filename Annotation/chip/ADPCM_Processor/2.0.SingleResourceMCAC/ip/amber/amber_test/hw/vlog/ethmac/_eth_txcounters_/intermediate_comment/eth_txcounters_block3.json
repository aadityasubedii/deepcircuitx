    "block_comment": "This block of code determines if the maximum frame size has been reached. It logically compares all 16 bits of ByteCnt and MaxFL, checking if they are equal. Then, it negates the result of HugEn and combines it with the previous comparison using bitwise AND. If both conditions are met (ByteCnt equals MaxFL and HugEn is false), MaxFrame is assigned 1, denoting the maximum frame size is reached, otherwise, it is assigned 0."
