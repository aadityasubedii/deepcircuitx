Comment: 
This block of code manages the Digital Reconfigurable Port (DRP) settings in relation to the DRP_CLK signal. Upon each positive edge of the DRP_CLK, the DRP_ADD and DRP_CS are set either when the next state is in the address phase or data phase. Additionally, if the current state is "READY", DRP_BKST is controlled by the use_broadcast signal. It effectively sets the operating phase of the DRP and configures DRP for broadcasting if the state is "READY".
