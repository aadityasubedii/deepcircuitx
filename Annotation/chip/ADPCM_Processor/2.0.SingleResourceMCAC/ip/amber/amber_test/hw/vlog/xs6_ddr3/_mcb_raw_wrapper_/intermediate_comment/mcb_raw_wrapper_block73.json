    "block_comment": "The block of code provides configuration for utilizing a specific port (port 4) in a memory interface system, depending on certain conditions. This is achieved by checking whether specific bits in the C_PORT_CONFIG signal are equal to \"B32\" and \"R32\" respectively, and by verifying if the 4th bit of C_PORT_ENABLE signal is 1. If these conditions are met, several signals related to read operations from port 4 are assigned values from the MIG (Memory Interface Generator), including the clock, read data, enable signal, overflow, error, full, empty signals, and the count. If the conditions are not met, these signals are simply assigned a bit value of 0. Write operations related signals are also assigned a bit value of 0, irrespective of the conditions."
