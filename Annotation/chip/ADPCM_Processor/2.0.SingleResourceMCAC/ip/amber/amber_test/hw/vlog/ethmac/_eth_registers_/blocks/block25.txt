Comment: 
The block is responsible for assigning specific parts of the transmitted 'TX_BD_NUMOut' and 'TXCTRLOut' values to the 'r_TxBDNum' and 'r_TxPauseTV' & 'r_TxPauseRq' variables respectively. This is achieved through the use of Verilog's 'assign' keyword, which binds the values of the right-hand side expressions to the left-hand side wire net. Bits 7:0 from 'TX_BD_NUMOut' are linked to 'r_TxBDNum', bits 15:0 and bit 16 from 'TXCTRLOut' are tied to 'r_TxPauseTV' and 'r_TxPauseRq' correspondingly.
