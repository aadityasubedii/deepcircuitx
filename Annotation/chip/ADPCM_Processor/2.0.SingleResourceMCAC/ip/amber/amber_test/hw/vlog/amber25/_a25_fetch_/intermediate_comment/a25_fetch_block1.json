    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the core stall signal in a Verilog design. The core stall signal (`core_stall`) is activated when any one of the following condition signals is true: the fetch stage stall (`o_fetch_stall`), the memory stage stall (`i_mem_stall`), the execution stage stall (`i_exec_stall`), or a conflict signal (`i_conflict`). The block uses an 'OR' operation to combine these condition signals, stalling the core operation when any stage of the fetch-execute-memory cycle is stalled or a conflict arises in the system."
