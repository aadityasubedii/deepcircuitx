Module name: a23_cache. Module specification: This module implements a configurable cache for the A23 processor, supporting multiple ways (2, 3, 4, or 8) and configurable cache lines and words per line. It handles read and write operations, cache hits and misses, and exclusive accesses. The module has input ports for clock, selection, exclusive access, write data, write enable, address, byte enable, cache enable, cache flush, and Wishbone bus signals. Output ports include read data, stall signal, and Wishbone request. Internal signals manage cache state, tag and data memory access, hit detection, and replacement policy. The module is structured with separate tag and data RAM blocks for each way, a state machine controlling cache operations (including initialization, idle, fill, invalidate, and write hit states), and logic for handling cache hits, misses, and exclusive accesses. It also includes a pseudo-random
