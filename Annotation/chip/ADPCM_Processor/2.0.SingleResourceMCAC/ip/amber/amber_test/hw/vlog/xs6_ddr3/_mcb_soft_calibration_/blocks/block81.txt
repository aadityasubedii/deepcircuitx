Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for de-asserting active clock enable training whenever the rest signal is active. It's a synchronous logic block in Verilog set to respond specifically to resets. Upon receiving a reset signal (RST), the Clock Enable Training (CKE_Train) is immediately set to zero, effectively acting as a reset mechanism for the clock enable training sequence.
