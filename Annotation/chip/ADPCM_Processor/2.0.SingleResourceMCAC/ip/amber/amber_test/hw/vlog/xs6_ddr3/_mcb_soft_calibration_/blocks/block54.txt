Comment: 
This block represents a state machine transition block in Verilog. It appears to be part of a higher level finite state machine (FSM). It first tests whether the "IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N" signal is not asserted. If so, it keeps the FSM in the current 'WAIT1' state which indicates it's in a hold or wait condition. If "IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N" is high, it transitions the FSM to the 'LOAD_RZQ_PTERM' state, suggesting that this state is responsible for loading some kind of impedance or termination control in the next state.
