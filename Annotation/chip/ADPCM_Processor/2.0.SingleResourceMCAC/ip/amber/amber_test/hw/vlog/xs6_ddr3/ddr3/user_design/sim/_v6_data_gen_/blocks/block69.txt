This block of code functions as a decision-making component, particularly governing data manipulation based on a specific condition. When the 3-bit input `data_mode_i` meets a specific binary condition (either '101' or '100') or if the reset input `rst_i` is activated, it creates a series of 8-bit shift values ranging from `8'h01` to `8'h80`. On the other hand, when the condition is not satisfied, it defines a different series of 8-bit values, which are the inverse of the original ones ranging from `8'hfe` to `8'h7f`. This control flow allows for the transformation of input data in one of two different manners based on the outlined conditions.
