    "block_comment": "The block serves as a counter increment mechanism. It increments the value of variable N_Term by 1 and transitions the state machine to the 'LOAD_ZIO_NTERM' state. The increment operation is achieved through leveraging Verilog's non-blocking assignment feature, which queues updates to be performed at the end of the time step, assuring accurate and safe operations in this synchronous digital system."
