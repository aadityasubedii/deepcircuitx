Comment: 
This block is essentially a selector for data assignment based on chosen victim line (SEL_VICTIM_LINE). It iterates over an array h_prbsdata adjusting its content. For elements' indexes that match SEL_VICTIM_LINE or are adjusted by multiples of NUM_DQ_PINS, the value from full_prbs_data at the selected index is assigned. For any other index, the current hdata value is maintained. The target use of this is not totally clear without further context, however, the manipulation indicates stage-based data division or grouping.
