    "block_comment": "This block of code starts a conditional generate construct, specific to Verilog hardware description language. It implements a compile-time configurable module, controlled by the `C_MEM_TYPE` parameter. In this particular block, if the memory type (`C_MEM_TYPE`) is not set to \"DDR2\", it starts a named generate construct `gen_cketrain_b`. All the subsequent code defined until the corresponding `endgenerate` will be synthesized or ignored based on this conditional statement. This enables flexibility in design configurations based on different memory types.\n"
