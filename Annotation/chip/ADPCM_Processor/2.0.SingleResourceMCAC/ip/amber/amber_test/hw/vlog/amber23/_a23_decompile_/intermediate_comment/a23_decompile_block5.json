    "block_comment": "The provided block of code works as a function to select one of several 32-bit signals based on the value of an input (num). The signals originate from various units of a larger system, including `U_EXECUTE`, `U_FETCH`, `U_CACHE`, and `U_DECODE`. The switch-case structure in Verilog is used to branch logic based on the value of 'num'. This logic is encapsulated within a function allowing it to be reused in multiple areas of the larger codebase."
