    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code mainly functions to ascertain the conditions for data transfer acknowledgements and data validity. The first line asserts the o_ack signal when a write request is received (in_wreq) and the write buffer is not in use (wbuf_used_r == 2'd0), or when there is valid read data (i_rdata_valid), or acknowledgment is owed and the pop condition is true. Thus, it controls the recognition of write or read commands. The second line assures the output validity (o_valid) when either the write buffer is in use (wbuf_used_r != 2'd0) or a request is received (i_req) and no wait condition exists for valid read data (!wait_rdata_valid_r); hence, managing the data flow control in real-time processing."
