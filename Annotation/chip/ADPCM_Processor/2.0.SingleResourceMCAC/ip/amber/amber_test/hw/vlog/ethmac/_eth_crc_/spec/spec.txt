Module name: eth_crc. 
Module specification: The eth_crc module is designed to implement an Ethernet Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), which is an error-checking mechanism widely used in digital data processing. The inputs include a Clock (Clk) signal which synchronizes the circuit's operations, a Reset signal for returning the Crc register to its default value, a 4-bit Data signal for representing the data to be checked by CRC, an Enable signal for operating the CRC, and an Initialize signal to reset the Crc register without the Reset signal. The output of the module includes a 32-bit Crc output register representing the calculated checksum and a CrcError bit that flags a mismatch of the CRC calculation and the expected value. Internally, the module uses a 32-bit Crc register to hold the ongoing CRC and CrcNext wire to compute the next CRC. In the RTL code, each bit of CrcNext is individually calculated using the current Data and Crc values, employing XOR operations which are essential in the operation of Ethernet CRC. These calculations respond to the Enable signal, thereby preserving current values when the Enable signal is low. The Crc register is updated with the value of CrcNext on the rising edge of the Clock signal except when either the Reset or Initialize input signals are active. The CRC Error output is triggered if the final CRC value does not match a predefined value.
