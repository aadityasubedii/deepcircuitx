    "block_comment": "This Verilog code controls the state of the 'LastByteIn' signal in a data receiving system. It operates synchronously on the rising edge of 'MRxClk' or 'Reset' signal. If the system is in a reset state, 'LastByteIn' is set to 0 with a time delay of 'Tp'. Furthermore, 'LastByteIn' is also reset to 0 if 'ShiftWillEnd' and 'RxByteCnt' are true, or if the system is in 'RxAbort' state. However, when receiving valid data (as indicated by 'RxValid', 'RxReady', 'RxEndFrm', and 'RxEnableWindow' flags), and the bit-wise AND of 'RxByteCnt' is not true, 'LastByteIn' is set to 1 after a delay of 'Tp'."
