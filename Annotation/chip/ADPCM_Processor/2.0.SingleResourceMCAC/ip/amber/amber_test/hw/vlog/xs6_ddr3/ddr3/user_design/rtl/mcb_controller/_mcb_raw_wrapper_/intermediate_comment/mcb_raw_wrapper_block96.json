    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines local parameters related to memory handling characteristics. `C_MEM_DDR3_ADD_LATENCY` indicates the additional latency of DDR3 memory, with the string \"OFF\" suggesting no additional latency has been added. The `C_MEM_DDR2_ADD_LATENCY` is a numerical parameter indicating the additional latency of DDR2 memory which is currently set as 0, implying no extra delay. `C_MEM_MOBILE_TC_SR` is likely associated with the memory timing control for mobile use cases, set as 0, suggesting default settings are carried over. These local parameters serve to configure different aspects of memory handling behaviors and timings."
