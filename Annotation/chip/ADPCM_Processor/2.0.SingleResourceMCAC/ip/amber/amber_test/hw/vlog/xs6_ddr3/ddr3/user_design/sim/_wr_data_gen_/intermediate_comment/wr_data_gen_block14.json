    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code chiefly serves as a counter (`user_burst_cnt`) with reset and count-down functionality. The code is synchronized with the positive edge of a given clock signal (`clk_i`). Initially, if the first bit of the reset input (`rst_i[0]`) is high, the `user_burst_cnt` signal resets. If a command start (`cmd_start`) signal arrives, the code branches based on the `FAMILY` macro, specifically for a \"SPARTAN6\". If `bl_i` (Burst Length) is zero, `user_burst_cnt` is set to a constant; otherwise, it is set to the value of `bl_i`. If the command doesn't start and the fifo is not full (`fifo_not_full`), the counter `user_burst_cnt` decreases until it reaches zero."
