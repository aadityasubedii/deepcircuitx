Module-level comment: The iodrp_mcb_controller is a DRP management module providing read and write operations through Verilog logic. It utilizes an array of input and output ports for data control, command validation, and operation statuses. The module uses internal signals for bit counting, addressing, data selection, and storage management. Essential components like a finite state machine drive the module's intricate operations including address and data phase management, and shifting sequences. Tasks for shifting and expansion, and state representation are integral for handling DRP operations.
