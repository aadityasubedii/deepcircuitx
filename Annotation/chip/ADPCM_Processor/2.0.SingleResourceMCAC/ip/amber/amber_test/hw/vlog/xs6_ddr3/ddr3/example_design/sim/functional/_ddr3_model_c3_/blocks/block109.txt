Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for triggering a timing check function on a specific data input. It does this by creating an `always` block that listens for changes to the 22nd bit (indexed from 0) of the `dq_in` array. Whenever this specific bit experiences a change, the `dq_timing_check(21)` function is executed. This function presumably checks timing characteristics associated with the change in state of the 22nd bit.
