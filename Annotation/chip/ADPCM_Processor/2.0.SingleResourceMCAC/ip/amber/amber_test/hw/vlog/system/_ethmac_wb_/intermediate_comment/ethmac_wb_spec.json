    "spec": "Module name: ethmac_wb. \n\nModule specification: The ethmac_wb is a Verilog module designed to interface with the Wishbone bus, a standard bus protocol used in system-on-a-chip designs. The module receives and transforms data from both master (m_wb) and slave (s_wb) modes. The transformation is based on the input parameters: data width (WB_DWIDTH) and select line width (WB_SWIDTH), which can be either 32 bits or 128 bits.\n\nThe module has 32 input ports and 34 output ports. The inputs include 16 ports for master and 16 ports for slave with flags such as address (adr), select (sel), write enable (we), write data (wdat), cycle (cyc), strobe (stb), acknowledge (ack), and error (err). The outputs mirror the inputs, reflecting the transformed data from the module back to the rest of the system.\n\nThe module doesn't define or use any internal signals. All the assignments and operations in the code are performed directly between the input and output ports.\n\nThe module consists of two main generate blocks that conditionally transform the data based on whether the data width is 32 or 128 bits, using an endian functionality to switch between data formats. The two blocks are essentially identical, aside from the input and output ports they operate on. In the end, they assign each input port to the corresponding output port, thus completing the transformation.",

The module receives and transforms data from both master (m_wb) and slave (s_wb) modes. The transformation is based on the input parameters: data width (WB_DWIDTH) and select line width (WB_SWIDTH), which can be either 32 bits or 128 bits.\n\nThe module has 32 input ports and 34 output ports. The inputs include 16 ports for master and 16 ports for slave with flags such as address (adr), select (sel), write enable (we), write data (wdat), cycle (cyc), strobe (stb), acknowledge (ack), and error (err). The outputs mirror the inputs, reflecting the transformed data from the module back to the rest of the system.\n\nThe module doesn't define or use any internal signals. All the assignments and operations in the code are performed directly between the input and output ports.\n\nThe module consists of two main generate blocks that conditionally transform the data based on whether the data width is 32 or 128 bits, using an endian functionality to switch between data formats. The two blocks are essentially identical, aside from the input and output ports they operate on. In the end, they assign each input port to the corresponding output port, thus completing the transformation."
