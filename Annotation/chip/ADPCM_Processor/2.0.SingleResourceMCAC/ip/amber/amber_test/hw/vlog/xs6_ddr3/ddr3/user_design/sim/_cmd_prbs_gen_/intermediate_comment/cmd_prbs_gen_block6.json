    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code forms a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) that is used for the generation of pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS). It receives a clock input signal (`clk_i`), a seed initialization signal (`prbs_seed_init`), and a seed input (`prbs_seed_i`), and enables clocking with the signal `clk_en`. When 'prbs_seed_init' is high, a new PRBS sequence is started using the input 'prbs_seed_i'. Otherwise, with every positive clock edge, when 'clk_en' is high, LFSR performs a shift operation with a combination of current and feedback values. The feedback values are determined from specific bit positions of the current register value, following the characteristic polynomial of the LFSR."
