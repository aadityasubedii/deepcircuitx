This block of code is responsible for executing the `dqs_neg_timing_check` procedure whenever there is a positive edge of the 20th bit in `dqs_in` array. In this edge-triggered mechanism, when the 20th bit of the `dqs_in` changes from a low logic level to a high logic level, it triggers the `dqs_neg_timing_check` procedure to perform specific operations related to timing check for signal `dqs_in[19]`.
