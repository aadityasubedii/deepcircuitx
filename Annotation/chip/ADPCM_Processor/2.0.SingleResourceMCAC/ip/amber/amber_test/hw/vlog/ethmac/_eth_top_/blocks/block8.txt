Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for generating a synchronous reset in the case of a write operation or a rising edge clock signal. It fulfills this through the employment of a condition check, using an 'if' statement that checks whether a reset input signal (wb_rst_i) has been triggered. If the reset signal is high, it sets the synced control frame signal, WillSendControlFrame_sync3, to 0. If it's not, it pushes the value of the preceding synced signal, WillSendControlFrame_sync2, into the control frame signal after the propagation delay "#Tp".
