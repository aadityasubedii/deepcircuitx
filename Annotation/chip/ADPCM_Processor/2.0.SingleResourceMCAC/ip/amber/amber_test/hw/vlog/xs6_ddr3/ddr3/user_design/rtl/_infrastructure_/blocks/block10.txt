This Verilog block dynamically configures the input clock according to the constant C_INPUT_CLK_TYPE. If the input clock is Differential, it instantiates a differential input buffer (IBUFGDS) by connecting positive and negative inputs sys_clk_p and sys_clk_n respectively, and output to sys_clk_ibufg with enabled on-chip termination. If the clock is single-ended, it instantiates a single-ended buffer (IBUFG) where the sys_clk input connects directly to the buffer and outputs to sys_clk_ibufg.
