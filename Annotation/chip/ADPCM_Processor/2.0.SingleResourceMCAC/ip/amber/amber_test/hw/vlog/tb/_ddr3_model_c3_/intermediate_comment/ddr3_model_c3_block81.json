    "block_comment": "The block is designed to monitor and enforce timing within the system. Specifically, it's focused on the 50th bit signal in the \"dq_in\" input data bus array. It does this by instantiating the \"dq_timing_check\" function when there's a logical change in the 50th bit of 'dq_in'. The function will further handle this bit signal logically according to its internal implementation, helping to maintain stable system operation and timing."
