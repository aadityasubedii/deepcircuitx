    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the read data operation from a cache system with varying ways (2, 3, 4, or up to 8). It functions by assigning the 'hit_rdata' based on which cache line (data_hit_way) hits, returning the corresponding data (data_rdata_way). If none of the cache ways is hit, a default value with the width of the cache line is generated. This implementation makes use of Verilog's conditional (ternary) operator and generate-conditional constructs to branch accordingly based on the number of cache ways specified."
