    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for signal transition detection. It checks the signal transition event of the 11-th bit of the 'dq_in' input on every clock cycle. This is done using 'always' statement that ensures the triggering of 'dq_timing_check' function call whenever there is a change in 'dq_in[10]'. The function 'dq_timing_check' takes the bit index as input, and presumably carries out some timing check operations."
