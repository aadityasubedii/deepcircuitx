    "block_comment": "This block handles timing and read commands for a cache memory system. On the rising edge of the input clock signal (i_clk), the block checks for a read hit event (ex_read_hit). If a read hit occurs, the block updates the read address (ex_read_address) using the specified bits from the input address (i_address) as defined by CACHE_ADDR32_MSB and CACHE_ADDR32_LSB."
