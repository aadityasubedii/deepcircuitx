    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to implement a synchronous reset mechanism. When a reset signal 'rst_tmp' is detected at the positive edge of system clock 'o_sys_clk', it initializes the reset register 'rst0_sync_r' with a predefined number of 1's (RST_SYNC_NUM). If the reset is not asserted, the reset register 'rst0_sync_r' is left-shifted by one bit in each clock cycle, effectively creating a countdown of system clock cycles post-reset, until the value of 'rst0_sync_r' becomes 0."
