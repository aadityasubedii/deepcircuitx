    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code executes a timing check function named 'dqs_neg_timing_check' on the falling edge ('negedge') of the 12th element of the 'dqs_in' array. The function call 'dqs_neg_timing_check(11)' is invoked whenever there's a negative transition detected by the always @(negedge dqs_in[11]) clause, providing a mechanism to verify the timing performance of a specific DQS line in a memory interface for example."
