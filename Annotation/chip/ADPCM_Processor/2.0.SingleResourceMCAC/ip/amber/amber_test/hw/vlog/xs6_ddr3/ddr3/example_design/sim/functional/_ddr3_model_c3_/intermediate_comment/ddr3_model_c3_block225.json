    "block_comment": "The block of code is a function in Verilog that gets the floor value of a given real number, i.e., it rounds down the number to the nearest lower integer. The function achieves this by comparing the real number to its integer value (obtained using the $rtoi system function), and if the real number is lesser than its integer conversion (i.e., the number has a decimal part), it decrements the integer value, else it outputs the value as it is as the number is already an integer."
