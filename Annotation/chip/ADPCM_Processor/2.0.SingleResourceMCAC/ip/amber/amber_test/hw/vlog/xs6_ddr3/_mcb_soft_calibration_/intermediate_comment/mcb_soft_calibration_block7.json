    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code serves to analyze and update certain system states and values based on whether specific conditions are met. It primarily updates 'STATE' and 'TARGET_DQS_DELAY' depending on 'Max_Value', 'Max_Value_Previous', 'Max_Value_Delta_Up', and 'Max_Value_Delta_Dn' parameters. In the initial condition where 'First_Dyn_Cal_Done' is false, the system is set to the 'FIRST_DYN_CAL' state. If 'Max_Value' is less than 'Max_Value_Previous' and 'Max_Value_Delta_Dn' is at least 'INCDEC_THRESHOLD', the system enters the 'DECREMENT' state. If 'Max_Value' is greater and 'Max_Value_Delta_Up' is at least 'INCDEC_THRESHOLD', the system goes into 'INCREMENT'. For both increment and decrement scenarios, 'TARGET_DQS_DELAY' is updated with the result of the 'Mult_Divide' function with 'Max_Value', 'DQS_NUMERATOR', and 'DQS_DENOMINATOR' as arguments. If none of these conditions are met, 'Max_Value' is substituted by 'Max_Value_Previous' and the state is changed to 'START_DYN_CAL'. The block thus serves to dynamically calibrate certain system parameters based on predefined conditions and threshold values.\n"
