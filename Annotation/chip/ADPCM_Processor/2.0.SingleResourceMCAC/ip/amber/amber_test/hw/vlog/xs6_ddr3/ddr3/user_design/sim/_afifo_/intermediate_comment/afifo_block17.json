    "block_comment": "The block activates synchronous write functionality when \"SYNC\" is given the value of '1'. When SYNC equals 1, it triggers the conditionally labeled block 'WRSYNC'. Within this block, an 'always' loop initiates whenever there is a change in the 'wr_ptr' (write pointer). The specific actions executed within the 'always' loop are not given in this code snippet, but they are most likely related to managing the memory write operations in a synchronous manner."
