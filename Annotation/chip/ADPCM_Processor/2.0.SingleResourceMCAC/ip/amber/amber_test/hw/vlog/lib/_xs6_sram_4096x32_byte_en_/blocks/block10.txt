This block is used for the instantiation of the SRAM module "u_sram0". Inputs for read operations and write enable flags are applied, while most other inputs like clock and reset signals for port B, and enable signals for port A are either grounded or are given always-on values indicating that port A is actively used for read operations. "i_address" is used as the memory address for data read, and "i_write_data" as the most significant byte of the data input to port A. The specified write enables suggests that the same bit is enabled for write operations in all four memory chunks.
