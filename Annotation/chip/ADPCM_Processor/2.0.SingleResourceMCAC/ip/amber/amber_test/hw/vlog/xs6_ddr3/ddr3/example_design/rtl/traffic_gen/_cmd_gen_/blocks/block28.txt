This block of code performs write operations into a memory unit based on clock input. The increment counts are dependent on the number of DQ pins on the memory module. For each clock cycle, write operations are done into the memory unit. The amount of data (or increments) that can be written into the memory depends on the number of DQ pins. For 128 to 144 DQ pins, 64 increments are written, for 64 to 128 DQ pins 32 increments are written and the process continues in a similar pattern down to 8 DQ pins where 4 increments are written. The write operations have a delay (#TCQ) and a burst length (MEM_BURST_INT/4).
