It also generates a system reset signal based on the calibration status. It uses conditional compilation to enable different hardware depending on the targeted FPGA hardware. If XILINX_FPGA is defined, the module generates the clock signals by using different IP cores (PLL_ADV or MMCM_ADV) to multiply the onboard clock and generates a buffered version of this clock as the system clock signal. It also generates reset signals synchronized to the system clock. If XILINX_FPGA is not defined, the module uses the onboard clock directly as the system clock signal. The calib_done_33mhz signal indicates whether calibration is done or not. This signal is used to generate the system reset signal (o_sys_rst)."
