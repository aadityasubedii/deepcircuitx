    "block_comment": "The block assigns a value to the 'con_write_data_word' based on the value of 'i_byte_enable'. Depending upon the bit values of the 'i_byte_enable', there's selective write operation on 'con_write_data_word'. For instance, if 'i_byte_enable' is 4'b0001, the lower 8 bit word of 'i_write_data' is written to the lower 8 bits of 'con_write_data_word' and the remaining upper bits from 'con_read_data_word' are preserved in 'con_write_data_word'. A similar bitwise selective operation takes place for the different values of 'i_byte_enable'."
