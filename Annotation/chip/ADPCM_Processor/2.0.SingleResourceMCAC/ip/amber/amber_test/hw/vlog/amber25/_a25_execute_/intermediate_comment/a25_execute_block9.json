    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is a sequential always block that triggers on the positive edge of reset or clock signals. Its function is to initialize or update a set of system parameters and status flags. If the system goes into reset, it initializes multiple output and local variables to default values, primarily zero, with the exception of 'iaddress_r' which is set to a specific hexadecimal value and certain status_bits variables that are assigned predefined system constants. However, under the positive clock edge, the always block behaves differently. This part of the block acts like a kind of register set, capturing and updating the values of numerous signals, depending on whether a corresponding update flag is high. The updated value is dependent upon the condition detailed beside each variable, with previous values maintained if the update condition is not met."
