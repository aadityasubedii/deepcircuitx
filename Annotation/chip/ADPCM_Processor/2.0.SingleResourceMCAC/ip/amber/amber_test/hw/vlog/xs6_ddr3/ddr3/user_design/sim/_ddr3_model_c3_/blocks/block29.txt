This block of code operates on the negative edge of dqs_in signal at index 3 and triggers a timing check function. The function is implemented as an always@ block, which is a basic construct in Verilog for describing behavior, implemented to call the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function. The function takes the index of the signal array as an argument, and this particular function is triggered only for the negative edge of the third index 'dqs_in' signal. It is used to monitor and correct any timing issues related to this specific signal pin.
