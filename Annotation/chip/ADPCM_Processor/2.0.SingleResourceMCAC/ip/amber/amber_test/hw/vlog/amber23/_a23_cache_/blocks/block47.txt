This block assigns a value to the variable `data_address`. Based on a conditional ternary logic operation, it performs a hit-or-miss check on data writing. If the `write_hit` signal is true, `data_address` will be assigned with the `i_address` ranging from 'CACHE_ADDR32_MSB' to 'CACHE_ADDR32_LSB'. If `write_hit` is not true but `source_sel[C_FILL]` is, `miss_address` within the mentioned range is assigned. If neither condition is met but `source_sel[C_CORE]` is true, `address` is assigned to `data_address`. If all conditions aren't met, `data_address` is assigned zero value within the 'CACHE_ADDR_WIDTH'.
