Comment: 
The block of code defines an asynchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) queue used for buffering read metadata. It is implemented using the afifo module with a depth of 32 entries, each of which is of width 'DWIDTH'. The FIFO queue reads and writes data on the same clock (clk_i), but operations can be asynchronous as indicated by the 'SYNC' parameter set to 1. The write operation happens when 'data_valid_i' is high and writes 'data_i' into the FIFO. On the other hand, read operation is enabled when 'rd_mdata_en' is high, and read data will be available on 'rd_v6_mdata'. The flag 'rd_mdata_fifo_empty' is high when there's no data to read from the FIFO queue.
