Comment: 
This block of code manages two registers (`WillTransmit_q` and `WillTransmit_q2`) that are updated on the rising edge of the `mrx_clk_pad_i` signal. The `WillTransmit_q` register is assigned the current value of the `WillTransmit` signal, and the `WillTransmit_q2` is assigned the current value of `WillTransmit_q`. Both assignments are delayed by `#Tp`. This operation essentially pipelining the `WillTransmit` signal with a delay of `#Tp` for synchronization.
