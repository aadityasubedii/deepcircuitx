Comment: 
This Verilog block manages hardware interrupt and software interrupt enable and disable configurations. On each positive edge of the input clock, if a write operation is commenced, it updates the enable and soft interrupt registers for four different interrupts: two hardware interrupts (irq0, irq1) and two fast interrupts (firq0, firq1) based on the incoming address signal. Depending upon the address value, it either sets or clears the respective interrupt enable register using bitwise OR and AND operations with the write data. Additionally, based on address value, it sets or clears specific bits in the software interrupt registers using bitwise operations with the least significant bit of the write data.
