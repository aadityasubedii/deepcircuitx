    "block_comment": "The block manages the conditions under which to display Time Interval Errors, more specifically tIH (Input High Voltage Pulse Width) and tIPW (Pulse Width) violations, in a dynamic memory context. The block gets activated whenever there is any change in 'odt_in' (Off-Die Termination Input). If the reset is not active, and Off-Die Termination is enabled and the system is not in 'self_refresh' mode, the block checks for violations of tIH and tIPW on ODT. In case of violations, an error message is displayed indicating the time of the violation and by how much time it violated the specifications. Finally, at the end of the block, the current simulation time is stored in 'tm_odt' (ODT time marker)."
