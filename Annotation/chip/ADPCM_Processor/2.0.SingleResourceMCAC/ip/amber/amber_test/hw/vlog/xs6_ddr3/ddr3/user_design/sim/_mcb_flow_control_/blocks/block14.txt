Comment: 
This block of code assigns the input signal 'bl_i' to the output wire 'wr_bl_o'. Implemented using the Verilog 'assign' keyword, this continuous assignment means any change to the 'bl_i' signal will instantly reflect on 'wr_bl_o'. This block is essentially acting as a buffer or conduit for signal propagation from 'bl_i' to 'wr_bl_o'.
