    "block_comment": "This block is a clock divider implemented in Verilog RTL. The purpose is to divide the input clock frequency (`pll_clk_beh`) by a set value (`AMBER_CLK_DIVIDER`) and output the resultant clock signal (`sys_clk_beh`). It increments the counter (`pll_div_count`) at every rising edge of `pll_clk_beh`. When the counter reaches twice the clock divider value (`AMBER_CLK_DIVIDER * 2`), it gets reset to zero. Simultaneously, there is a condition check that toggles `sys_clk_beh` signal. When `pll_div_count` reaches `AMBER_CLK_DIVIDER`, the `sys_clk_beh` is set to zero, and when the counter is zero, `sys_clk_beh` is set to one. This approach effectively divides the incoming clock frequency by the target divider value."
