Module-level comment: The 'iodrp_mcb_controller' is a DRP controller for memory cells, designed to manage read/write operations. It functions with a state-driven operation flow which is controlled by a finite state machine. The module uses input signals like 'memcell_address', 'write_data', 'rd_not_write', etc., and provides output signals such as 'read_data', 'rdy_busy_n', 'DRP_CS', etc. Internally, registers and wires are used to track the state, address, sync, and data for the DRP operations. Key parts of the code include a task for data shifting and an always block for state transitions.
