Comment: 
This line of code provides a boolean operation that compares the transmission length with the value 4. If the transmission length is less than 4, the result of the operation will be true (1), otherwise, it will be false (0). This is implemented using an assignment operation in Verilog, which is continuously driven, meaning it will always reflect the results based on the current values of TxLength.
