    "block_comment": "The block of code shows the function of a flip flop with asynchronous reset and manual clear signal. It operates by triggering on the rising edge of the input clock. If reset or manual clear is active, the error_byte and data_error flags are immediately set to zero. In the absence of reset and manual clear signals, these flags take the values of error_byte from the last clock cycle. If a data error occurs, it displays an error message with expected and received data information. The block of code manages error detection and display based on input data and control signals."
