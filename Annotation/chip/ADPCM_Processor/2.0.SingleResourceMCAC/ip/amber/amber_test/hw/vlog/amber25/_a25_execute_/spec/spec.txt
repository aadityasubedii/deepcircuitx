Module name: a25_execute. Module specification: The a25_execute module is a critical component of a processor's execution stage, responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations, handling memory accesses, and managing the processor's state. It takes various inputs including clock, reset, control signals, data from previous stages, and configuration parameters. The module produces outputs such as memory addresses, write data, status flags, and control signals for subsequent stages. Internally, it utilizes several key components: an ALU for arithmetic and logical operations, a barrel shifter for data manipulation, a multiplier for multiplication operations, and a register bank for storing and retrieving data. The module processes instructions based on the current processor mode and condition codes, handles interrupts, and manages privilege levels. It also includes logic for handling memory operations, updating the program counter, and maintaining the processor's status bits. The module is designed with clock synchronization and reset functionality, and includes provisions for testing and debugging
