This code block plays a role in the reset control of a Receive (Rx) FIFO (First In, First Out) memory component. Specifically, `RxFifoReset` signal is asserted when a new incoming frame is detected and it is synchronized to prevent metastability. This is achieved by using the bitwise AND between the delayed (`SyncRxStartFrm_q`) and the inverted delayed twice (`~SyncRxStartFrm_q2`) version of the start frame signal to get a one clock period pulse whenever a start of the frame is recognized.
