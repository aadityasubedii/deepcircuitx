    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional code generation block that is used for handling memory type specific configuration. If the memory type defined by `C_MEM_TYPE` is \"DDR2\", it triggers specific instruction `:gen_cketrain_a`. The `generate` and `if` construct combined allows for conditional instantiation based on the memory type. This facilitates a flexible memory system configuration adaptable to varying system needs."
