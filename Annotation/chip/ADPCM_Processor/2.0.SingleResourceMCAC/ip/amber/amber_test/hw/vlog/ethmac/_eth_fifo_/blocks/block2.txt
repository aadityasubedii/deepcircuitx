This block of code defines the data writing part of a FIFO (First In, First Out) memory buffer in a synchronous digital system. On each rising edge of the system clock, if both write and clear signals are high, the first position in the FIFO memory `fifo[0]` is written with input data `data_in`. If the write signal is active, but the FIFO is not full (`full` signal is low), the position in the FIFO memory pointed by `write_pointer` is written with `data_in`. The time delay `#Tp` is used to simulate the propagation delay of the write operation in real hardware.
