Module name: a25_icache. Module specification: The a25_icache module is an instruction cache for the A25 processor core, designed to provide faster access to instructions by storing frequently used main memory data. It is parameterized with configurable cache lines, words per line, and ways of associativity. The module interfaces with the core through input signals like clk, reset, i_core_stall, i_select, i_address, i_cache_enable, and i_cache_flush, and output signals such as o_stall and o_read_data. It also interacts with the write-back system via o_wb_req, i_wb_read_data, and i_wb_ready signals. Internally, the module uses signals like c_state for cache state management, tag_rdata_way and data_rdata_way for storing tag and data information, and various control signals
