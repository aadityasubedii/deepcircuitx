Comment: 
The block of code registers changes in the "State_Start_DynCal" signal on the rising edge of the "UI_CLK" clock signal. If the "RST" (reset) signal is active, the block resets the "State_Start_DynCal_R1" register to zero. If the "RST" signal is not active, the "State_Start_DynCal_R1" register carries the value of the "State_Start_DynCal" signal.
