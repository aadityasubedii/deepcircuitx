    "block_comment": "This Verilog code module serves the function of an instantiated Memory Control Block (MCB) traffic generator for a specific port (Port 4) contingent on the enable flag. When the enabling flag (C_PORT_ENABLE[4]) is set to 1, two modules are instantiated: init_mem_pattern_ctr and mcb_traffic_gen. These modules respectively initialize the memory pattern controller and drive the memory control block traffic at Port 4. If the enabling flag is not set, all error and comparison signals are set to zero, essentially disabling the traffic generator for Port 4."
