This block of code creates a mapping based on specific port configurations and its enable status and resets the system in other scenarios. If the configuration matches "B32" and "R32", it maps the read signals to the corresponding MIG signals allowing communication, and if the port is not enabled, it sets these signals to '0â€™. Writing-related signals are default to '0' as no writing operation is involved. 

The overview of this block is the following:
The block handles data flow based on configurations. If configuration "B32" and "R32" is matched, read-related signals are mapped to the corresponding MIG signals where the enable flag is asserted, ensuring communication. If not enabled, signals default to low. Write-related signals are not used and are set to low.
