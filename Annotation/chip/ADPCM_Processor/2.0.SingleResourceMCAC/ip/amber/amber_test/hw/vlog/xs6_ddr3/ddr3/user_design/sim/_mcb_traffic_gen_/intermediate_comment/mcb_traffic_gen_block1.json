    "block_comment": "This block defines a test generator (tg_status) for an error checking system. It takes a clock input, reset trigger, manual clear flag, error data, comparison data, read data, comparison address, comparison bitwise level, and multiple flags denoting whether memory control buffers (MCB) are full or empty. It outputs an error status and an error flag. Upon detecting any discrepancy between the comparison data and the read data or when the MCBs are overloaded or empty, tg_status will report an error using the associated output flags."
