Comment: 
This block of code is a memory control logic for a read-write operation. It is responsible for read and write request handling, address formation, managing flag for active read, and acknowledgement signal utilization. At every active rising clock edge, it examines if acknowledgment for read is received, if true it makes read ready else it monitors read request. It also checks if the command buffer is not full, then updates the request flags and forms word-boundary memory address. The flag read_active is set/unset based on read request/acknowledgment. It also gives an acknowledgment for a successful read operation when the read is active, and the read data buffer is not empty. Read acknowledgement is reset otherwise.
