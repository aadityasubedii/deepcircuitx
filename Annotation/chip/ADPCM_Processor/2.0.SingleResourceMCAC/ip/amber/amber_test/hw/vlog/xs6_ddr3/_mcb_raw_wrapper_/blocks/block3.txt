This block provides a conditional pull-down or pull-up for the Data Strobe (DQS) based on the memory type and configuration. If the memory type, denoted by C_MEM_TYPE, is either DDR, MDDR, or DDR2 with differential DQS disabled (C_MEM_DDR2_DIFF_DQS_EN == "NO"), then a pull-down is applied to the DQS (mcbx_dram_dqs). However, if the memory type does not meet these conditions, then both pull-down is applied to the DQS, and a pull-up is applied to the complimentary DQS (mcbx_dram_dqs_n).
