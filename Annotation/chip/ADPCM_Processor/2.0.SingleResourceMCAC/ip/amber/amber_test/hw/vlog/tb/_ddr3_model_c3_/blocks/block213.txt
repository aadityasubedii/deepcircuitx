This block of code defines a task called `cmd_task` which processes and executes various DDR SDRAM commands. Here's a summary of its function and implementation:

[Function of the block]: The `cmd_task` processes and executes DDR SDRAM commands, including LOAD MODE, REFRESH, PRECHARGE, ACTIVATE, WRITE, READ, ZQ calibration, and power management operations. It checks for timing violations, updates internal states, and manages the memory's operational modes.

[Implementation details of the block]: The task uses a large case statement to handle different commands. It performs various checks for timing violations, bank states, and operational conditions. It updates internal registers and counters to track the memory's state, including active banks, refresh operations, and power modes. The task also handles initialization sequences, manages the delay-locked loop (DLL), and controls features like auto-precharge and multipurpose register operations. Error messages are displayed for violations, and debug information is provided when enabled.
