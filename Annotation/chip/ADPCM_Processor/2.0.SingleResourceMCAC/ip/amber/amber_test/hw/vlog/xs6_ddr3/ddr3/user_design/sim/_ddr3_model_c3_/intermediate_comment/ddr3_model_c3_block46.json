    "block_comment": "This line of code functions to initiate a DQS positive timing check whenever there is a negative edge detected on the 20th bit of the `dqs_in` input bus. This is achieved using the `always` keyword in conjunction with the negative edge (`negedge`) system task, which effectively sets up a trigger that activates the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function each time a falling edge occurs on the specified bit of the `dqs_in` bus."
