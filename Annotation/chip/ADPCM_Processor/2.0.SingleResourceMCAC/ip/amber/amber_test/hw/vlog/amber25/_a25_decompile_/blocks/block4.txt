Comment: 
This function selectively retrieves a 1-bit signal value from one of five sources within the system. This functionality is driven by a 3-bit input 'num', which is used in a case statement to determine the source of the return value. The sources include system flags located at `U_EXECUTE.o_write_enable`, `U_AMBER.mem_stall`, `U_EXECUTE.o_daddress_valid`, `U_AMBER.core_stall`, and `U_WB.mem_read_data_valid_r`.
