Module name: a25_dcache. Module specification: The a25_dcache module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple cache ways (2, 3, 4, or 8) with features such as cache line filling, write-back, exclusive access, and cache flushing. It manages cache hits and misses, handles read and write requests, and interfaces with external memory. The module has input ports for clock, reset, testing signals, cache requests, data, addresses, and control signals, as well as output ports for read data, stall signals, and write-back requests. Internal signals include state machines, cache way selection logic, tag and data RAM interfaces, and various control flags. The module is divided into several blocks, including cache initialization, tag and data RAM management, cache hit detection, way selection logic, and state machine control. It uses parameterized design for flexible cache configurations, employs a random replacement policy
