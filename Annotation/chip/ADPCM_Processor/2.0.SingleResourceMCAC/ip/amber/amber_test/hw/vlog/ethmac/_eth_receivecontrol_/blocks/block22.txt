This block of Verilog code describes a synchronous digital circuit, which resets and assert checks for variable length of incoming types in a streaming data receiver system. When a reset signal (RxReset) is detected at a rising master clock (MRxClk) edge, the TypeLengthOK bit is set to '0' to indicate the system is not ready to receive data. In the absence of a reset, when the DetectionWindow is available and ByteCntEq12 equals to true, the block compares the 8 most significant bits of RxData with the same bits from TypeLength. A similar operation is done with ByteCntEq13 for the 8 least significant bits of the same variables. If both checks are successful, the TypeLengthOK bit is set accordingly. The bit is reset to '0' once the receiving end of the process is completed.
