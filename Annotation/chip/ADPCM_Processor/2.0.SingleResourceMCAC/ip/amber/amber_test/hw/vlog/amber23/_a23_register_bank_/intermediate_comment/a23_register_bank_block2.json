    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is a multiplexer that assigns the output, `o_rn`, based on the value of the selector, `i_rn_sel`. The multiplexer selection is performed through a string of conditional operators `? :` where for each condition, if `i_rn_sel` equals a certain 4-bit value, the corresponding `r#_out` becomes the output. If `i_rn_sel` equals none of these values, the default output, `r15_out_rn`, is assigned to `o_rn`."
