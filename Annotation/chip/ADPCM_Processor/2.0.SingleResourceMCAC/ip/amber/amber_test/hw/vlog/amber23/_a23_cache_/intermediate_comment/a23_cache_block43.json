    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is involved in determining the write hit data based on the input address. It uses the input address bits [3:2] to partition the write_data_word into the current hit data. If the bits are '00,' '01,' '10,' or anything else, they are positioned to different parts of write hit frame. The entire block runs on combinational logic with no time delay. This means the output reacts immediately to the input, ensuring a quick read/write logic."
