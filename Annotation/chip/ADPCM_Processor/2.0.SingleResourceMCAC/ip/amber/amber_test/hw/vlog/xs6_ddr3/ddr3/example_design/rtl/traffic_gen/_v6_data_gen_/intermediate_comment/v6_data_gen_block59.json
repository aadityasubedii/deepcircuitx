    "block_comment": "This block of code generates specific data patterns for a system with 16 Data Query (DQ) pins. The 'if' statement checks if the number of DQ pins is 16 and evaluates the current data pattern. If the data pattern matches any of the predefined patterns like \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\" or \"DGEN_ALL\", it implies that the block of code will likely generate data resembling these patterns."
