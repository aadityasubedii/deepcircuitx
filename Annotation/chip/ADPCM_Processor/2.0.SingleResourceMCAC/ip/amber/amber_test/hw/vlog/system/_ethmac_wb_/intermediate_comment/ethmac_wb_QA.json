The module takes inputs and outputs in both master (m_wb) and slave (s_wb) modes. It includes parameters for varying data width (WB_DWIDTH) and select line width (WB_SWIDTH). Based on the WB_DWIDTH parameter, the module transforms the incoming data and select lines using different endian formats: either 32 bits or 128 bits. No specific functionality is implemented beyond these transformations; the module simply assigns its inputs to corresponding outputs after processing.\n"
