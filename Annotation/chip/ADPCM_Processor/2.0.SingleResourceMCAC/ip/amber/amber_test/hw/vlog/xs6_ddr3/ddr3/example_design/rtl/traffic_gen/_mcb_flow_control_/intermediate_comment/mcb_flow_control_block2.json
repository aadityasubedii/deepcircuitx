    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for state transition in a State Machine. At the positive edge of the input clock, if the least significant bit of the reset signal is high, the current state is reset to the binary value '0001', implementing a synchronous reset. If not, the current state goes towards the next state with a delay specified by TCQ, encapsulating a common behavioral description model of a State Machine transition and control flow."
