    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic circuit used to manage read buffer data, address, and validity status. It operates under clock (clk) and reset signals. Upon a reset, it zeroes out read buffer data, address, and validity. During normal operation, it reacts to different states and signals such as i_cache_flush, i_wb_ready coupled with the c_state of CS_FILL3, and o_wb_req. Upon the condition i_cache_flush, it makes the read buffer invalid. When i_wb_ready and c_state is in CS_FILL3, it updates the read buffer with read data, sets the miss_address as the read buffer address, and validates the read buffer. If the output write-back request (o_wb_req) is set, it marks the read buffer as invalid."
