    "block_comment": "This Verilog block manages a synchronous update of the PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) lock status based on the system state. The block is triggered on the rising edge of the UI clock. It checks if the system is not entering and not currently in self-refresh mode, and if those conditions are met, the PLL lock status is updated synchronously with the UI clock."
