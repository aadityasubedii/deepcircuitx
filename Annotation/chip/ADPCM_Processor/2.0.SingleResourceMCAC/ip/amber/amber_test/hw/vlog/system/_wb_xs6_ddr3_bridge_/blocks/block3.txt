This block of Verilog code implements a multiplexer circuit that selects data based on the address provided. Upon each clock cycle's rising edge, if the memory read is not empty and the read operation is active then, it assigns the output (o_wb_dat) according to a 2-bit value from i_wb_adr. If this 2-bit value equals to 0, 1, 2 it assigns bits 0-31, 32-63, 64-95 respectively from i_rd_data to output, otherwise, it will assign bits 96-127 from i_rd_data to output.
