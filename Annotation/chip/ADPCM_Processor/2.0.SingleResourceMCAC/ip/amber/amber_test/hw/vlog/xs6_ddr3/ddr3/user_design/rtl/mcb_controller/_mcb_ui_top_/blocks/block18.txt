This block is responsible for assigning data and control signals across different points of the system. It is accomplishing this by using non-blocking 'assign' statements in Verilog, which ensures that all assignments are done concurrently and without any delays. The block primarily handles data transfers, arbitration, enabling signals, and detecting error states in writing operations.
