This block of code is responsible for generating a delayed version of the input signal 'ras_n'. The delay is implemented using a non-blocking assignment '<=' and the '#BUS_DELAY' system task in Verilog, which inserts a delay equal to the value of 'BUS_DELAY' before assigning the value of 'ras_n' to 'ras_n_in'.
