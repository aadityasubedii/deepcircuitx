    "block_comment": "This block of code proposes an error detection operation for a certain configuration of a Virtex6-family FPGA set with 4-burst length memory. The error detection is conducted on half the number of Data Query (DQ) pins in parallel. In a specific for loop, it associates each 'error_byte' with a specified condition. The condition validates if the data read from the memory data FIFO is not empty, the read enable signal 'rd_mdata_en' is active, and there is an inconsistency between the unread fetched and comparator data. Altogether, it triggers an error flag on matching these conditions. This aids in checking the integrity of data fetched from the memory."
