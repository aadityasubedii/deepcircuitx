Comment: 
This block of code initiates a timing check upon the positive edge of the 31st bit of the `dqs_in[]` array. The `always @` statement in Verilog is used to create a block that reacts to changes in one or more signals, in this case, the positive edge of `dqs_in[30]`. Whenever this signal undergoes a positive edge transition, the function `dqs_neg_timing_check(30)` is called to run the timing check for bit 30.
