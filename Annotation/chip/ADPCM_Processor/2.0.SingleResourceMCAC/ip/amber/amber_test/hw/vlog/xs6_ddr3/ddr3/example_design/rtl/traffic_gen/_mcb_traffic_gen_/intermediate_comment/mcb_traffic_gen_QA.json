This module operates by generating commands for writing and reading operations to the memory, serving to simulate workloads and verify that the MCB performs correctly under different conditions. Parameterization allows the module to adapt to different memory configurations and operation modes. The ability to adjust parameters like memory burst length, data patterns, and address width ensures broad testing capabilities. This module further comprises several other modules that help to orchestrate the writing and reading processes, and handle errors that arise during simulation. These include the cmd_gen, mcb_flow_control, read_data_path (or WR_ONLY_PATH), write_data_path modules among others. It also keeps track of traffic statistics with the help of the tg_status module."
