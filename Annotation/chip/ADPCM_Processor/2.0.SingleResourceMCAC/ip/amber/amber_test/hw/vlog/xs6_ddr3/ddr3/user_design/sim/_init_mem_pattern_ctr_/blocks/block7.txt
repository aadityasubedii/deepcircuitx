The block initiates a range of addresses as well as seeding commands and data. It sets up starting and ending addresses by assigning `BEGIN_ADDRESS` and `END_ADDRESS` constants to `start_addr_o` and `end_addr_o` respectively. Similarly, it pre-defines the command and data seeds by assigning `CMD_SEED_VALUE` and `DATA_SEED_VALUE` constants to `cmd_seed_o` and `data_seed_o` respectively.
