    "block_comment": "The code snippet is instantiating a 'Output Buffer' module called 'OBUFT' named 'iob_we'. This block serves as the interface between internal FPGA signals and the external Memory Controller Block (MCB) write enable signal. It takes an internal write enable (ioi_we) signal and a tristate control signal (t_we) as inputs. When tristate control signal is high, it isolates the external MCB from the FPGA. When tristate is low, the value of the internal write enable signal is driven onto the external MCB write enable (mcbx_dram_we_n)."
