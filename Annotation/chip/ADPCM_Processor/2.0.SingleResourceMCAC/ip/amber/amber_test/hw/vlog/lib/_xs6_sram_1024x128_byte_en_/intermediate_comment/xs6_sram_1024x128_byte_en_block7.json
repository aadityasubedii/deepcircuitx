    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is defining and initializing a Block RAM instance named RAMB16BWER with a data width of 36 bits on both its ports (A and B). The block has been implemented without any output registers (DOA_REG and DOB_REG set to 0). There is no asynchronous reset for this RAM block, as indicated by EN_RSTRAM_A and EN_RSTRAM_B parameters set to \"FALSE\". The block initialization value SRVAL_A is set to 0, and it also assigns the initial state to the SRAM Block (INITP_00 - INITP_07 and INIT_00 - INIT_3E), using the SRAM4_INIT values ranging from SRAM4_INIT_0 up to SRAM4_INIT_62."
