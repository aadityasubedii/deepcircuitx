    "spec": "Module name: a25_coprocessor. \n\nModule specification: The a25_coprocessor is a co-processor controller for an ARM A25 processor that manages caching operations which include reading and writing cache control and status data, setting and clearing fault conditions, and setting areas of memory as cacheable, updateable, or disruptive. It also possesses testing and debugging functionalities.\n\nThe module has multiple input and output ports. Input ports include `clk` (system clock), `reset` (system reset),  `scan_enable` and `test_mode` (debugging and testing routines), `i_core_stall` (stall signal), `i_copro_opcode1`, `i_copro_opcode2`, `i_copro_operation` (operation control signals),  `i_copro_crn`, `i_copro_crm`, `i_copro_num` (control/register selection signals), `i_copro_write_data` (writing data), and `i_fault`, `i_fault_status`, `i_fault_address` (fault conditions). Output ports include `o_copro_read_data` (reading data), `o_cache_enable` (cache operation signal), `o_cache_flush` (cache flush signal), and `o_cacheable_area` (cacheable memory area signal).\n\nCrucial internal signals and registers used in this module include `cache_control` (manage cache operations), `cacheable_area`, `updateable_area`, `disruptive_area` (define memory areas for cache updates and disruptions), `fault_status`, `fault_address` (record fault conditions), `copro15_reg1_write` (triggers cache flush), and debugging registers `copro_operation_d1` and `copro_crn_d1` (store state for debug).\n\nThe Verilog code composes several blocks executing different functions. A block with always@reset, clk deals with resetting fault status and address, a parallel one handles resetting cache control and defining cacheable, updateable, and disruptive areas, another one defines the `copro15_reg1_write` signal triggered by a write operation. An important block handles CO read data based on control/register number and another one used for debug prints either write or read operations of the CO register. Each block executes logically synchronizing with the system clock and responding to reset. All these contribution to the comprehensive functioning of a25_coprocessor.",

These registers also allow reading the fault status and address.\n\n6. copro15_reg1_write: This is a wire which signals when a write operation to a specific register (coprocessor register 1) is commanded.\n\n   Explanation: This signal is set high when a write operation to coprocessor register 1 is being performed. This is used to trigger a cache flush.\n\n7. \\(Debugging signals\\)\n   - copro_operation_d1 and copro_crn_d1: These are used to store state from the previous clock cycle for debug purposes.\n   \n   Explanation: These registers store state information on the operation and control/register number from the previous clock cycle. They are used in outputting debug information. \n\nThese internal signals and registers play crucial roles in handling cache control operations, defining cacheable, updateable and disruptive memory areas, handling fault conditions, and managing coprocessor register writes. The ability to read these registers allows for comprehensive monitoring and control of the system."

It also possesses testing and debugging functionalities.\n\nThe module has multiple input and output ports. Input ports include `clk` (system clock), `reset` (system reset),  `scan_enable` and `test_mode` (debugging and testing routines), `i_core_stall` (stall signal), `i_copro_opcode1`, `i_copro_opcode2`, `i_copro_operation` (operation control signals),  `i_copro_crn`, `i_copro_crm`, `i_copro_num` (control/register selection signals), `i_copro_write_data` (writing data), and `i_fault`, `i_fault_status`, `i_fault_address` (fault conditions). Output ports include `o_copro_read_data` (reading data), `o_cache_enable` (cache operation signal), `o_cache_flush` (cache flush signal), and `o_cacheable_area` (cacheable memory area signal).\n\nCrucial internal signals and registers used in this module include `cache_control` (manage cache operations), `cacheable_area`, `updateable_area`, `disruptive_area` (define memory areas for cache updates and disruptions), `fault_status`, `fault_address` (record fault conditions), `copro15_reg1_write` (triggers cache flush), and debugging registers `copro_operation_d1` and `copro_crn_d1` (store state for debug).\n\nThe Verilog code composes several blocks executing different functions. A block with always@reset, clk deals with resetting fault status and address, a parallel one handles resetting cache control and defining cacheable, updateable, and disruptive areas, another one defines the `copro15_reg1_write` signal triggered by a write operation. An important block handles CO read data based on control/register number and another one used for debug prints either write or read operations of the CO register. Each block executes logically synchronizing with the system clock and responding to reset. All these contribution to the comprehensive functioning of a25_coprocessor."
