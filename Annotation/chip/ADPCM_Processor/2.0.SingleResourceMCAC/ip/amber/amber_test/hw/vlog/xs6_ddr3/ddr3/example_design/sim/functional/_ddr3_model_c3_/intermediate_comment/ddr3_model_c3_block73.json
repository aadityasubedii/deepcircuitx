    "block_comment": "The block triggers a timing check function every time there's a change in the 58th bit of the dq_in data input. This is achieved with the use of an 'always' procedural block in Verilog, which essentially sets up an event-triggered routine. The event here is any change in dq_in[57] and the triggered routine is the call to a function dq_timing_check with the argument 57."
