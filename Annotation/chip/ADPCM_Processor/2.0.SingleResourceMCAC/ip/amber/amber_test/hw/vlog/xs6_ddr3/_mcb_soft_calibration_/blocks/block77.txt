This block manages a reset mechanism with a counter. When the UI_CLK signal or RST signal triggers, if RST is active, the block sets Block_Reset and RstCounter to zero. Otherwise, if Pre_SYSRST is active, the block initializes RstCounter with RST_CNT. If not, and if RstCounter is lesser than TZQINIT_MAXCNT, the block sets Block_Reset to 1 and increments the RstCounter. This logic efficiently handles the initialization and counting process for a reset operation.
