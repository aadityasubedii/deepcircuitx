    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions to write data into a buffer during the positive edge of a clock cycle, provided that a write request is issued and the command buffer is full. It achieves this by tracking the active clock edge and conditions regarding the command buffer and the write request. When the conditions are met, the 'write_buf_r' is set to 1, indicating that the write buffer is now active and the buffer values 'wb_sel_buf_r', 'wb_dat_buf_r', and 'wb_adr_buf_r' are updated with new input values 'i_wb_sel', 'i_wb_dat', and 'i_wb_adr' respectively."
