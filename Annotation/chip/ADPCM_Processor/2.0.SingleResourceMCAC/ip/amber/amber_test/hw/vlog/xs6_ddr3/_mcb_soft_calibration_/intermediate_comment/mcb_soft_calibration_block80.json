    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for carrying out an assignment operation to the `rst_tmp` signal based on the logical AND of the negated signals `PLL_LOCK_R2` and `SELFREFRESH_MODE`. Essentially, this line of code sets `rst_tmp` to 1 only when both `PLL_LOCK_R2` and `SELFREFRESH_MODE` are 0, otherwise `rst_tmp` will be 0. The implementation leverages bitwise negation and logical AND operations to manipulate these boolean signal states accordingly."
