    "spec": "Module name: a23_alu. \n\nModule specification: The 'a23_alu' is an Arithmetic Logic Unit( ALU) module type written in verilog, primarily designed to perform various arithmetic and logical operations based on control signals. It takes 32-bit inputs (i_a_in and i_b_in), a 9-bit control input (i_function) and two single bit inputs (i_barrel_shift_carry, i_status_bits_carry from the Barrel Shifter and Status Register respectively) and outputs a 32-bit result (o_out) along with 4-bit flags (o_flags) capturing overflow, carry-out, zero and sign flag conditions.\n\n'a23_alu' uses a variety of internal signals to handle operations like swapping of input bits, bit-wise inversion, setting the carry in/out signals, overflow, and execution of specific operations like AND, OR, XOR, sign, and zero extension. The internal signals themselves are controlled by other signals ('swap_sel', 'not_sel', 'cin_sel', 'cout_sel', 'out_sel') generated by slicing i_function.\n\nThe module contains sections handling specific operations: assigning a and b values based on 'swap_sel', assignment of 'b_not', 'carry_in' and 'carry_out', handling overflow with 'overflow_out', managing an adder section depending on FPGA type to handle addition/subtraction (if it is a Xilinx FPGA, a specific adder function from library is called), Control of logical operations AND, OR, XOR, Singular and Zero extension, and finally decoding of 'out_sel' and 'o_flags'.\n\nThe module is designed for customizability and integration with other hardware modules (like Barrel Shifter) and its behavior can be extensively controlled by setting the right values in 'i_function', 'i_status_bits_carry' and 'i_barrel_shift_carry'. It is suitable for applications needing extensive hardware-level arithmetic and logical operations.",

It takes 32-bit inputs (i_a_in and i_b_in), a 9-bit control input (i_function) and two single bit inputs (i_barrel_shift_carry, i_status_bits_carry from the Barrel Shifter and Status Register respectively) and outputs a 32-bit result (o_out) along with 4-bit flags (o_flags) capturing overflow, carry-out, zero and sign flag conditions.\n\n'a23_alu' uses a variety of internal signals to handle operations like swapping of input bits, bit-wise inversion, setting the carry in/out signals, overflow, and execution of specific operations like AND, OR, XOR, sign, and zero extension. The internal signals themselves are controlled by other signals ('swap_sel', 'not_sel', 'cin_sel', 'cout_sel', 'out_sel') generated by slicing i_function.\n\nThe module contains sections handling specific operations: assigning a and b values based on 'swap_sel', assignment of 'b_not', 'carry_in' and 'carry_out', handling overflow with 'overflow_out', managing an adder section depending on FPGA type to handle addition/subtraction (if it is a Xilinx FPGA, a specific adder function from library is called), Control of logical operations AND, OR, XOR, Singular and Zero extension, and finally decoding of 'out_sel' and 'o_flags'.\n\nThe module is designed for customizability and integration with other hardware modules (like Barrel Shifter) and its behavior can be extensively controlled by setting the right values in 'i_function', 'i_status_bits_carry' and 'i_barrel_shift_carry'. It is suitable for applications needing extensive hardware-level arithmetic and logical operations."
