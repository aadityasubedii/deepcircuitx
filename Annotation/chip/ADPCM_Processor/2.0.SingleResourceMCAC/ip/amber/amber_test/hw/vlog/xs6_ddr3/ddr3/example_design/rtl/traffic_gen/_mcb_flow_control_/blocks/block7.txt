Comment: 
This block of code is used to store command, address, and block length data at the positive edge of the input clock if the push_command is high. The implementation uses non-blocking assignments for each register with a #TCQ delay, resulting in each register being updated every clock cycle if the push_cmd condition is met. This design allows for simultaneous updates of all registers following the timing constraints, which is important in synchronous designs.
