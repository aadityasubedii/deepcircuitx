    "block_comment": "This block of code mainly manages the Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) control signals and the MCB_UIREAD signal. Depending on the value of 'nextstate', it sets DRP_ADD, DRP_CS, and MCB_UIREAD. Specifically, if 'nextstate' equals to ADDR_PHASE, both DRP_ADD and DRP_CS are set. If 'nextstate' equals to DATA_PHASE, DRP_CS and MCB_UIREAD are set, with MCB_UIREAD also depending on the rd_not_write_reg signal. Moreover, if the current state is READY, the DRP_BKST is set to reflect the value of 'use_broadcast'."
