Module-level comment: 
/*
This module serves as a testbench top-level for a memory controller, supporting up to 6 ports. It generates and manages memory read/write traffic using traffic generators and memory pattern controllers for each enabled port. The module configures parameters, generates commands, compares data, and reports errors. It implements port-specific logic for different modes (read/write) and maps command fields between ports based on their configurations. The design uses generate statements to instantiate port-specific components and handle various port combinations efficiently.
