This block of code implements a command task for a DDR3 SDRAM controller. Here's a summary of its function and implementation:

[Function of the block]. The cmd_task handles various DDR3 SDRAM commands, including LOAD MODE, REFRESH, PRECHARGE, ACTIVATE, WRITE, READ, and ZQ calibration. It processes these commands, updates internal states, and performs timing checks.

[Implementation details of the block]. The task uses a large case statement to handle different commands. For each command, it performs the following actions:
1. Checks for timing violations and illegal command sequences.
2. Updates internal registers and flags (e.g., active banks, refresh counters, mode registers).
3. Handles special cases like power-down modes and self-refresh.
4. Implements DDR3-specific features such as auto-precharge, burst operations, and multi-purpose register access.
5. Manages the initialization sequence for the SDRAM.
6. Generates debug and error messages for various conditions.
The implementation uses multiple arrays and variables to track the state of different banks, pipelines for read/write operations, and timing parameters to ensure proper SDRAM operation.
