    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for data pipelining in SPARTAN6 FPGA family. The generate-if construct checks the FPGA family type, and if it is SPARTAN6, the code within the if block gets implemented, creating a pipeline stage that responds to the rising edge of the input clock. The 'always' block is used to encapsulate clock sensitive hardware description that defines pipeline registers or memory elements that are clocked with a positive-edge clock."
