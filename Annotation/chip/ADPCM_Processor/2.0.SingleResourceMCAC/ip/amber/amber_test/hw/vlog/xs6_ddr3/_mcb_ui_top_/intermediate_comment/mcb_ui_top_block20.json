    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a function called `convert_arb_slot` that converts a given arbitration slot of a MIG (Memory Interface Generator) port into a specific port configuration based on the provided enable ports and the port configuration mode. The function receives three inputs \u2013 the enabled ports, the port configuration mode, and the MIG arbitration slot. It works by initializing an integer and an 18-bit register for port mapping. The port mapping is determined by the case statement based on the port configuration input. Then, it calculates the number of enabled ports. Finally, the function iterates over up to six ports and for each port, it either maps the port's allocation in the MIG arbitration slot to the mapped port or assigns an idle state (binary 111) if the port is not enabled or exceeds the number of enabled ports."
