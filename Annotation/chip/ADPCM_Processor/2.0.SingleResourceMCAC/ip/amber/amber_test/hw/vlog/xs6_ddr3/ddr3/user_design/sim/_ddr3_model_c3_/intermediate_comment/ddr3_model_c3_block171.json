    "block_comment": "This block of code is a procedural block that triggers a function call when there is a change in the signal `cs_n_in`. The function `cmd_addr_timing_check` is called with the argument `0` activated whenever a change is detected on the `cs_n_in` signal. The purpose of this code is to perform a timing check on the command address whenever there's a change in chip select (`cs_n_in`). This helps to ensure the synchronization of data exchange by keeping track of timing parameters."
