    "block_comment": "This block of code is initializing an SRAM module `u_sram0`. It is enabled with a constant high enable signal `ENA (1'd1)`. Meanwhile, it binds clock signal `i_clk` to the clock input `CLKA`, the write enable vector `wea_b0[3:0]` to its write enable `WEA`, and mapped `i_address[8:0]` to `ADDRA` (zero-extended with five 0s). Besides, input data `i_write_data[31:0]` is connected to `DIA` and the output data will be stored in `read_data_b0[31:0]`. All other switching or extra logic features are turned off by setting them to `0`."
