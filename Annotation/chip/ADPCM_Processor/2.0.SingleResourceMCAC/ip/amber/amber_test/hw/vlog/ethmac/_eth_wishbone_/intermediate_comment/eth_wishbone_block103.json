    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the transmission buffer descriptor (TxBD) address generation in a communication based system. On either a positive edge of the system clock (WB_CLK_I) or if global reset signal is high, the first \"if\" block resets the TxBDAddress to '0'. Otherwise, under the condition that transmission enable (r_TxEn) is high and its previous state (r_TxEn_q) is low, the TxBDAddress is reset again, implying start of a new transmission. If both conditions are not met and there is an active transmission status write request (TxStatusWrite), a temporary address (TempTxBDAddress) is assigned to the TxBDAddress."
