    "block_comment": "This code block controls the assignment of values to several parameters related to a Memory Interface Generator (MIG) on a certain port based on the condition of C_PORT_ENABLE[2]. If the C_PORT_ENABLE[2] bit is set, then various attributes (like arbitration enable, command enable, command clock, bus address, etc.) take values mapped from associated p2 port variables. If the bit is unset, all these values are assigned as 'b0, implying a disabling or neutral state. Special attention is given to p2_cmd_bl, which is a composite assignment based on p2_cmd_instr[2] and p2_cmd_bl[4:0]."
