Comment: 
This block of code generates a clear signal for a read hit in the execution stage of the pipeline. It achieves this function by assigning the signal 'ex_read_hit_clear' when the current state ('c_state') is in the CS_EX_DELETE state, suggesting the deletion operation is being executed. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog ensures that this logic will constantly evaluate during simulation. The clear signal will be raised for a read hit whenever the deletion operation is in progress, thereby resetting the read_hit register for the next execution cycle.
