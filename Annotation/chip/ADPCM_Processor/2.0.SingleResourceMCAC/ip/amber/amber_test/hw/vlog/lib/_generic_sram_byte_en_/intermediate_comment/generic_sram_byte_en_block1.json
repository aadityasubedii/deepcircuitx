    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code describes a memory module with read and write functionality. On a positive clock edge, if the reset signal is high, the memory module initializes to a specific state defined by `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO` constant: if high, the output read data and internal memory \"mem\" is cleared. If the reset isn't high, the block behaves based on `i_write_enable` signal and an address provided by `i_address` input: when write-enable is active, it writes the input data `i_write_data` into memory at specific indexes controlled by the byte-enable `i_byte_enable` input. The block reads the data from memory at the location specified by `i_address` to output `o_read_data`, if the write-enable is inactive. This detailed description breaks down the memory operation as defined in this Verilog block.\n"
