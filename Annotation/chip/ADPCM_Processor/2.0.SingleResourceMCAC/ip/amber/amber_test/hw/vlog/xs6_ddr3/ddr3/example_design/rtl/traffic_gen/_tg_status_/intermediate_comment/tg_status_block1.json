    "block_comment": "This block performs error status management in synchronous digital systems. It is triggered at the positive edge of the `clk_i` signal. Initially, if a reset `rst_i` or `manual_clear_error` signal is given, the code clears the error status and the error set flags. If no reset is provided, the block checks if a `data_error_i` has occurred without previous `data_error_r` and if there's no `error_set`, in such case it sets specific error conditions related to the address (`cmp_addr_i`), command buffer full (`mcb_cmd_full_i`), write buffer full (`mcb_wr_full_i`), read data empty (`mcb_rd_empty_i`), comparison and read data. After the check, it clears specific bits in `error_status` to 0 irrespective of the error conditions. The delays used (#TCQ) suggest a pipeline implementation."
