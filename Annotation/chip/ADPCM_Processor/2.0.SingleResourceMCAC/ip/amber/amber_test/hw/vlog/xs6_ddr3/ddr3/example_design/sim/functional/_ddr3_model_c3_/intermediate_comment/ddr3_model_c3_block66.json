    "block_comment": "This Verilog code implements a task named \"dqs_pos_timing_check\" which validates the timing of positive edges of a Data Strobe (DQS) signal during write operations in a DDR SDRAM system. It uses several condition checks and debug statements to ensure valid write operations and warn of potential timing violations. The checks are primarily aimed at validating write leveling, write preamble, write postamble, and data bit degradation. These are achieved by continuously monitoring the system time, input DQS signal, and the status of DLL lock & other pertinent signals. Temporal values are updated based on the state of certain data signals and potential timing violations are flagged with warning messages. Write sequencing and other operations are also updated based on the condition checks in the code. Delay assignments are used for data output enablement and data output, and the method uses loops for iterative operations."
