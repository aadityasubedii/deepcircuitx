    "block_comment": "This block manages the write-in-progress signal for a memory operation. When a positive edge of clock input is detected, it checks the reset input and the last word write flag. If either is active, it sets the write-in-progress signal to false, indicating that no current write operation is in progress. However, if the current state of the memory operation is WRITE, it sets the write-in-progress signal to true, showing that a write operation is ongoing."
