    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for checking the status of timing for the 19th bit (index 18) of the 'dq_in' bus at every change. It achieves this function by invoking the 'dq_timing_check' procedure with the index '18' as an argument whenever 'dq_in[18]' changes, thus it reacts asynchronously to changes in the particular bit of the input."
