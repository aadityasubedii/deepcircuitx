    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages dynamic memory calibration after system self-refresh. On a positive edge of UI_CLK, if a reset signal is detected, the dynamic calibration performance flag and the state holder for the dynamic calibration performance are set to 0. If there is no reset signal, the code mirrors the flag's state and sets the state holder based on whether the current state is START_DYN_CAL. Furthermore, it implements conditions to decide when to perform START_DYN_CAL after self-refresh: if the system is in the self-refresh exit DQS calibration state and not in the START_DYN_CAL state, or if the system is in the START_DYN_CAL state and the third stage of SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE is not invoked."
