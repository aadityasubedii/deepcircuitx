    "block_comment": "The function 'Data_Gen' generates a 4*NUM_DQ_PINS wide data value for an input integer. The implementation begins by initializing 'Data_Gen' to zero. It then checks if the input integer 'i' is odd or even. For odd values of 'i', it sets distinct bits of 4 data bytes within 'Data_Gen' from LSB to MSB. For even values of 'i', it sets different bits at positions dependent on the value of 'j', which is half of 'i'. The updated bit positions stretch across 4 portions of 'Data_Gen', each of NUM_DQ_PINS width."
