    "block_comment": "This block of code invokes the `dq_timing_check` function every time there is a change detected on the 59th bit (index 58 as it's 0-indexed) of the `dq_in` signal. Specifically, the `always @` procedural block is a fundamental construct in Verilog used to observe and respond to changes in variable states. Here, the block calls `dq_timing_check(58)`, passing the index of the bit in question. The function `dq_timing_check` likely checks some form of timing or data qualification based on the state of this bit."
