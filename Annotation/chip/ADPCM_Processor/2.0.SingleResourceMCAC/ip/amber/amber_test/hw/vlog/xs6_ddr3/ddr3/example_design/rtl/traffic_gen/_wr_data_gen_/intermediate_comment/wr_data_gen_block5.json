    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is principally in charge of managing the ready command indicator 'cmd_rdyF'. The implementation uses sequential logic that's trigger on a clock's rising edge. It will set 'cmd_rdyF' high when reset is high or 'cmd_startF' is high and 'bl_i' is 1. Additionally, 'cmd_rdyF' will also be set high when 'user_burst_cnt' is 2 and the FIFO is not full. In all other cases, 'cmd_rdyF' will be set low."
