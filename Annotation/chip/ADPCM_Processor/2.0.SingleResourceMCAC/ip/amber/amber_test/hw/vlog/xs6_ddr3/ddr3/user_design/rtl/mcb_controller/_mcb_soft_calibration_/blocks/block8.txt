This block is a state machine implementation for a dynamic calibration stage. The block operates based on the positive edge of the user interface clock (UI_CLK). If the reset signal (RST) is active, the state register 'State_Start_DynCal' is set to zero. However, if the state machine is currently in the 'START_DYN_CAL' state and no reset is requested, the 'State_Start_DynCal' is set to one. For all other states, 'State_Start_DynCal' maintains a value of zero.
