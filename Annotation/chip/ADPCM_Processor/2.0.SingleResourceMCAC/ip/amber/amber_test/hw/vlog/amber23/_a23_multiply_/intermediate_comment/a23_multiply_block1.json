    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of a specific slice of the product variable to 'o_out'. The operation can be thought of as a down-size conversion, as it narrows down a vector by slicing it. This slice operation discards the most significant bit and the least significant bit of 'product', as it only includes bit 1 to bit 32, effectively reducing the original width by two bits. Thus, this Verilog code block helps to extract a relevant middle portion of 'product'."
