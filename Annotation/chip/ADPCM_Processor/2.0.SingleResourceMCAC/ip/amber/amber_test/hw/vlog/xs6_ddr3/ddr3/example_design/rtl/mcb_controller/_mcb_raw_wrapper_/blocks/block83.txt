Comment: 
The block generates the internal systemic reset signal, `int_sys_rst`. The `assign` keyword in Verilog represents a continuous assignment statement. Here, it assigns the result from the combinational logic of the or operation (`|`) between the systemic reset signal `sys_rst` and the negated gated phase-locked-loop-lock signal `~gated_pll_lock` to `int_sys_rst`. The reset signal is activated if either `sys_rst` is high or `gated_pll_lock` is low.
