    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block performs the function of assigning the value of `p3_wr_error_i` to `p3_wr_error`. It does this using the `assign` keyword, which creates a continuous assignment statement in Verilog. This means that the value of `p3_wr_error` is constantly updated to reflect any changes in the value of `p3_wr_error_i`."
