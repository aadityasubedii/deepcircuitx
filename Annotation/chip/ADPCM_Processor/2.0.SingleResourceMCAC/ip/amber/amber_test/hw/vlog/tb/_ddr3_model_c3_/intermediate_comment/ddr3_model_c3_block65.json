    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates a routine check of DQS signal timing on the rising edge of the input DQS. It utilizes the 'always' keyword which asserts that anytime there's a positive edge detected on dqs_in[0], the procedure 'dqs_pos_timing_check(0)' is called to perform the timing check for the first DQS signal."
