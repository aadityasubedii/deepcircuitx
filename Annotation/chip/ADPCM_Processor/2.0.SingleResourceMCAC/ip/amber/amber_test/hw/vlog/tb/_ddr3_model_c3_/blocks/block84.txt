This block of code is used for monitoring the signal input changes on the 47th bit of the dq_in bus. It uses an always block to continuously monitor the specific bit, and upon any change in its state, it triggers a function or subroutine call to "dq_timing_check" with the bit index as an argument, which presumably checks timing parameters for the 47th bit signal transition.
