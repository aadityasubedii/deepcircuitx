    "block_comment": "This block manages the read data counts requested in a synchronous system. It is triggered by a rising edge of the clock (`clk_i`). The block first checks if the initial bit (`rst_i[0]`) of the system reset signal is set. If set, it re-initializes the `rd_data_counts_asked` to zeros on the next clock cycle. If not reset, the block checks if both the delayed instruction validator signal (`instr_vld_dly1`) is true and the 33rd bit of the data from the pipe (`pipe_data_in[32]`) is set. If the conditions are met and the six bits from the 36th through the 41st of `pipe_data_in` are not set, it increments the `rd_data_counts_asked` by 64. Else, it increments by the value that the same six bits represent."
