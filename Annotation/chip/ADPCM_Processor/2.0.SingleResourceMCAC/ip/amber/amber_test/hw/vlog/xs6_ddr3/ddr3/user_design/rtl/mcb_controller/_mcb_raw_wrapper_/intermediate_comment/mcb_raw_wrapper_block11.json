    "block_comment": "This block of code defines an output buffer in a Verilog RTL design and is responsible for driving the row address strobe (RAS) signal to a DRAM module. The OBUFT instance named 'iob_ras' takes in two input signals. The input signal 'ioi_ras' denotes the value to output onto the RAS line, and the 't_ras' signal controls whether this output buffer is enabled and is actively driving its output. When 't_ras' is set, the buffer will set the output 'mcbx_dram_ras_n' to follow 'ioi_ras'; otherwise, it remains in Hi-Z state, not driving any value."
