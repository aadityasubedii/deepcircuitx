Comment: 
This block of code handles error monitoring of two data paths (S1 and S2) in a system. The code checks multiple conditions based on different parameters like `m2_in_progress`, `m2_wb_cyc_i`, `m2_wb_stb_i` etc, and based on these conditions, it assigns error outputs to `m2_wb_err_o`. When `m2_in_progress` is active, the error value of the addressed data path (S1 or S2) is forwarded to `m2_wb_err_o`. If there is a cycle in progress (`m2_wb_cyc_i`) and a strobe signal (`m2_wb_stb_i`), but neither data paths are being addressed, it sets the error output to 1. For all other conditions, the error output is cleared to 0.
