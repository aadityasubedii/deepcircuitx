    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for implementing a delay line in a clock signal. The `always @` construct is used to continuously monitor the `ck_n` signal for any changes. Once a change is detected, the current value of `ck_n` is assigned to `ck_n_in` after a delay specified by `#BUS_DELAY`. This behavior essentially creates a delayed version of `ck_n` on `ck_n_in`. This can be useful in scenarios where, due to constraints of setup and hold times, a delayed clock signal is required."
