    "block_comment": "This block of code responds to a positive edge of either the WB_CLK_I clock signal or the Reset signal. It primarily focuses on handling the reset conditions and read enabling for the RxPointerLSB_rst. In the event of reset, the RxPointerLSB_rst is set to 0. Simultaneously, if the conditions of MasterWbRX and m_wb_ack_i are met, it similarly sets RxPointerLSB_rst to 0. However, if RxEn and RxEn_q, and RxPointerRead are all high (or '1'), it assigns the lower two bits from ram_do to RxPointerLSB_rst."
