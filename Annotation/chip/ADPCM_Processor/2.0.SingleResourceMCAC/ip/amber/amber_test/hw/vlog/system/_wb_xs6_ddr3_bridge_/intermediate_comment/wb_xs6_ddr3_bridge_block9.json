    "block_comment": "This is a conditional block for a data width configuration check in a hardware design. It examines whether the data width (represented by the parameter WB_DWIDTH) equals to 32. If the given condition is true, it entitles the code block that follows with the label 'wb32w'. The encapsulated statements inside this condition would be implemented only if the data width is 32 bits."
