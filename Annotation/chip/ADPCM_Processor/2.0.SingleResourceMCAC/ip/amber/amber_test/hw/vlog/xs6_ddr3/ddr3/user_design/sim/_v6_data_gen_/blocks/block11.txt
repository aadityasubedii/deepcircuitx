This block assigns portions of the 'w1data' wire array to rearranged subsets of 'w1data' when 'MEM_BURST_LEN' equals 8. The assignment operation is performed by bitwise operations on the 4 segments of 'w1data', each of size 'NUM_DQ_PINS'. More specifically, for each segment, the 5 least significant bits are shifted to the middle, and the remaining bits are moved to the end after inducing a delay of '#TCQ' time units. This block essentially rearranges data bits in different portions of the 'w1data' wire array based on the value of 'MEM_BURST_LEN'.
