    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, mcb_soft_calibration_top, performs soft calibration of Memory Controller Blocks (MCB) in FPGA memory setups by interacting through numerous input, output, and bidirectional ports with user interface and 'mcb_soft_calibration' sub-module. It leverages internal signals for achieving synchronous operations, addressing, I/O handling, and maintaining calibration statuses. The configuration is achieved by considering parameters such as UI_CLK, memory type, RST, etc. Additional components like IOBUF and IODRP2 are used for interfacing and data processing purposes respectively. Additionally, provisions are made for conditional hardware instancing for certain memory types."
