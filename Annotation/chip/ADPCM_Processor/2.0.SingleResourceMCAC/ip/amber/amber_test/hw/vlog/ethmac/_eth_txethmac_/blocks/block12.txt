Comment: 
This block of Verilog code performs a comparison operation. Specifically, it checks if the 4-bit value of the 'RetryCnt' variable is equal to that of the 'MaxRet' variable. The result of this comparison is assigned to the 'RetryMax' signal. If the values are equal, 'RetryMax' will be high (logic 1); otherwise, it will be low (logic 0).
