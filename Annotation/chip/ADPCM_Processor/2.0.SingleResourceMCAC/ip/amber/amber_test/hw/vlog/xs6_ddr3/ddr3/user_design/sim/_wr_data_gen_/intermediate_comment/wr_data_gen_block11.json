    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the output signal `cmd_rdy_o` based on the status of `cmd_rdy` and `fifo_not_full`. The `cmd_rdy_o` signal is driven high (logic 1) when both `cmd_rdy` and `fifo_not_full` are high, indicating that the system is ready to accept a new command and that the FIFO buffer is not full. If either condition is not met, `cmd_rdy_o` is driven low (logic 0). This is implemented using a bitwise AND operation."
