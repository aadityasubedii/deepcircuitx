Module name: xs6_sram_1024x128_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 1024x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA block RAM resources. It consists of eight 36-bit wide RAMB16BWER primitives, each configured as 512x32 bits, to create a memory with 128-bit data width and 10-bit address space. The module has input ports for clock (i_clk), write data (i_write_data), write enable (i_write_enable), address (i_address), and byte enable (i_byte_enable), and an output port for read data (o_read_data). Internal signals include write enable signals for each bank (wea_b0, wea_b1), read data signals for each bank (read_data
