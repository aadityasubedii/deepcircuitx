It takes various parameters such as memory instruction mode, data seed value, command seed value, etc. It provides specific start and end addresses for the memory test activities, defines various memory accessing modes (like sequential, fixed, etc.), and provides error-checking mechanisms during the memory testing phase. The module also supports different ports mode operations such as read mode, write mode and bidirectional mode. The designed test patterns/data are utilized in performing Write and Read operations over memory for testing. It also checks for comparison errors and correspondingly alters states and signals."
