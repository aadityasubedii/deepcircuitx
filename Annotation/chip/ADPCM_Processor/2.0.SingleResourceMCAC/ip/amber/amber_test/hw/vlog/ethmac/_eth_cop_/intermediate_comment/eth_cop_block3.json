    "block_comment": "This block is a counter reset and increment logic setup. On every positive edge of a system clock (wb_clk_i) or system reset (wb_rst_i), the block executes. If the system reset or any acknowledgment (ack_i) or error (err_i) signals are high for either system 1 or system 2, the counter (cnt) gets reset to 0. Alternatively, if either system's cycle signals are active, the counter is incremented by 1."
