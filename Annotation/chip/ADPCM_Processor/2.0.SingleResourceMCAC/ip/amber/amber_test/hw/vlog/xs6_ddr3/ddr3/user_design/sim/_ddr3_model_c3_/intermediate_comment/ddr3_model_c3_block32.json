    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for an edge-triggered timing check on DQS input signal. When the 0th bit of the dqs_in signal flips from positive to negative (negedge), the function dqs_neg_timing_check is immediately invoked with 0 as the input argument. This approach is often used in signal integrity checks or synchronisation in digital design to maintain the robustness of the system."
