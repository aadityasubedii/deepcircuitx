It has separate input and output signals for command, write, and read data. For command and write data, data flows from the system clock domain to the DDR clock domain, and for read data, the flow is vice versa. A pair of FIFOs is used for each operation (command, write, and read) to cross the clock domains with a full and empty flag. This module allows for the management of command instructions, write data, and read data between different clock domains (system and DDR)."
