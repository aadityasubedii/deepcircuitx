    "block_comment": "This code block, written in Verilog RTL, is a function responsible for UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) operation and debug display statements. It begins with an `always` block, triggered on the positive edge of the `i_clk` signal. The code primarily differentiates between two conditions: First being if the `wb_start_write` and `i_wb_adr` values match the `AMBER_UART_ICR` criteria, and second handling the FIFO (First In, First Out) enabled/disabled scenarios. Under the FIFO conditions, it checks a set of conditions related to `tx_interrupt`, `tx_fifo_half_or_less_full`, `tx_fifo_empty` and `uart_cr_reg`, and accordingly displays debug or interrupt set/cleared messages."
