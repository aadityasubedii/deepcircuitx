    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a value to 'master_rdat' based on the current value of 'current_slave'. It utilizes a conditional operator to establish a set of conditions that the 'current_slave' value must meet. If 'current_slave' matches a defined value from 4'd0 to 4'd7, 'master_rdat' is correspondingly assigned from i_sX_wb_dat where X ranges from 0 to 7. If none of the explicit conditions are met, 'master_rdat' is assigned the value of 'i_s2_wb_dat' by default."
