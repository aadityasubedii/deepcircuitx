    "block_comment": "This block of code is a part of a conditional logic in a system where the block assigns various control signals if the S3 AXI function is not enabled (C_S3_AXI_ENABLE == 0). Each control signal in the block is directly assigned from another corresponding signal. For instance, if the system has C_S3_AXI_ENABLE disabled, control signal 'p3_arb_en_i' gets assigned the value of 'p3_arb_en', 'p3_cmd_clk_i' is assigned the value of 'p3_cmd_clk', and so on. This block allows system signals to be redirected and controlled dynamically based on the state of the AXI function, playing an integral part in the system's signal control strategy."
