    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module implements a DDR3 SDRAM memory controller interface with multiple ports for command, write, and read operations. It instantiates a memory controller wrapper and a testbench module, handling memory interface signals, clock generation, and reset logic. The design supports up to 6 ports (p0 to p5) and includes calibration, error reporting, and various memory interface control signals. It uses a PLL for clock management and implements multiple data and command interfaces for efficient memory access.\n*/"
