    "block_comment": "The code block generates a Output Buffer (OBUFT) for a DDR3 memory type. This is conditional as determined by an if statement which checks the variable C_MEM_TYPE for being \"DDR3\". The OBUFT is named \"iob_rst\", with three port connections; (1) Output to \"mcbx_dram_ddr3_rst\", (2) Input from \"ioi_rst\", and (3) it uses tristate control \"t_rst\"."
