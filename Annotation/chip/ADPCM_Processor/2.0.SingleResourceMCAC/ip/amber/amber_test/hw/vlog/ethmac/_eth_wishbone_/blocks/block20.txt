This block handles memory abortion when a reset event occurs in the system. It's triggered at the positive edge of the Master Read Clock or when a system reset occurs. If the reset is activated, the synchronous 2nd bit of 'Abort' for the receiver is set to 0 after a certain propagation delay 'Tp', interpreting it as a signal to abort any ongoing data reception. If there's no reset, the value of the 1st bit of 'Abort' for the receiver is simply transferred to the 2nd bit during the next clock cycle or pixel, after a propagation delay 'Tp'.
