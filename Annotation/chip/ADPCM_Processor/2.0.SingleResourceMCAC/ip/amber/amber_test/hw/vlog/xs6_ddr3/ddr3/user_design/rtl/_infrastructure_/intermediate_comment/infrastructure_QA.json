It takes system clock and reset inputs and generates various clock and reset signals that can be used throughout the design. The module is parametrizable with different clock frequencies and reset characteristics. The code uses a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) to generate multiple clock signals with different frequencies and phases based on the provided system clock. The generated clocks are correctly synchronized with other components needs. Additionally, it also generates an asynchronous reset signal, which resets the whole system when necessary."

If it is active, it will trigger a reset in the system and reinitialize the module.\n\nOutput ports:\n\n1. clk0: This is an output clock, derived from the phase-locked loop (PLL) and buffered for distribution in the system.\n2. rst0: This is the synchronous reset output. It is derived from the input system reset and the PLL lock status, after being synchronized to the clk0.\n3. async_rst: This is an asynchronous reset output. It is active when the input system reset signal is active or when the PLL is not locked.\n4. sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk: These are PLL generated output clock signals with different frequencies or phases, used to clock other devices in the system.\n5. pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90: These are strobe output signals, generated by the BUFPLL_MCB component, designed to sample data either in the rising edge, or both the rising and falling edge of the clock waveform.\n6. pll_lock: This output indicates that the PLL is locked and it is functioning normally.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAll these output ports provide signals that are important for the timing and control of other components in the digital system. The clock outputs dictate the speed at which components operate, the reset outputs ensure the components can return to a known state, and the pll_lock output provides a status signal that can be used in the system to ensure the PLL is operating correctly."
