    "block_comment": "The block of code is a conditional statement within the \"generate\" construct in Verilog. It's function is to instantiate hardware based on the value of the parameter \"DWIDTH\". The condition it tests for is if \"DWIDTH\" equals either 64 or 128. If that condition is true, the code within the \"begin: SHIFT_VALUE\" and its corresponding \"end\" block is executed, otherwise the code is skipped. This allows different hardware generations based on the value of \"DWIDTH\"."
