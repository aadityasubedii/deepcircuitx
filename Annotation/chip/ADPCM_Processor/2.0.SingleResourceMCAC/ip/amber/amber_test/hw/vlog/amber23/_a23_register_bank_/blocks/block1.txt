Comment: 
Without a specific Verilog RTL code block provided, I cannot generate a precise comment or summary. However, here's an example of how a possible comment for a given code might look like:

Example code:
```verilog
module adder (
  input [31:0] A,
  input [31:0] B,
  output reg [31:0] SUM
);
  always @(*) begin 
    SUM = A + B; 
  end
endmodule
```

Comment generation:
This block of code represents a 32-bit adder module. The adder takes two 32-bit inputs (A, B) and sums them yielding a 32-bit output (SUM). The computation is designed to happen at any change of the input signals A or B. The computation is achieved by the use of always block which is causally sensitive to all changes that occur to A and B. The final result of the addition is stored in the output register SUM.
