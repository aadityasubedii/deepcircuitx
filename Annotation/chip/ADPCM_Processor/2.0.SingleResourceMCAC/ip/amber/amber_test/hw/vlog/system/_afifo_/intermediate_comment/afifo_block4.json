    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating write pointers that are delayed by one and two clock cycles respectively. On every positive edge of 'rd_clk' signal, it updates 'wr_pointer_d1' with the gray code equivalent of 'wr_pointer' and 'wr_pointer_d2' with the previous value of 'wr_pointer_d1'. These delayed pointers can be useful for synchronizing data with the write operations."
