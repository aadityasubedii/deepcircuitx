    "block_comment": "This block is a Verilog module that provides a clock-driven mechanism to reset the `TxAbortSync1` flag. The block listens for either a rising edge (`posedge`) clock signal, `WB_CLK_I`, or a high `Reset` signal. If the `Reset` signal goes high, the `TxAbortSync1` flag is synchronously reset to 0 with a time delay specified by `#Tp`. If there are no changes in the `Reset` signal, the value of `TxAbort` is assigned to `TxAbortSync1` with the time delay `#Tp` at every clock's rising edge."
