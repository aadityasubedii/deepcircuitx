Comment: 
This block is responsible for managing the behavior of three signals: full_out_r, full_carry_out_r and use_quick_r based on clock (clk) and reset signals. It resets these signals on the presence of a reset signal and updates them based on system state otherwise. More specifically, when a reset signal is detected, it sets full_out_r and full_carry_out_r to 0, and use_quick_r to 1. When only a clock signal is received, it updates full_out_r and full_carry_out_r with the values of full_out and full_carry_out, respectively. Meanwhile, use_quick_r is updated with the negation of o_stall.
