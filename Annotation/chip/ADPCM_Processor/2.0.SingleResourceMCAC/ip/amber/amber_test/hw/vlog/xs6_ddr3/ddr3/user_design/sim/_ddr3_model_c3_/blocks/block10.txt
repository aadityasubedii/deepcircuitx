Comment: 
This block of Verilog code triggers an event `dqs_neg_timing_check` whenever there is a rising edge (`posedge`) in the 23rd bit of the signal `dqs_in`. This is achieved by using the `always @` construct, which indicates that the block following it should be executed whenever the condition inside the parenthesis is met - in this case, whenever `dqs_in[22]` experiences a rising edge. This logic is typically applied to perform operations related to clock cycle timing checks.
