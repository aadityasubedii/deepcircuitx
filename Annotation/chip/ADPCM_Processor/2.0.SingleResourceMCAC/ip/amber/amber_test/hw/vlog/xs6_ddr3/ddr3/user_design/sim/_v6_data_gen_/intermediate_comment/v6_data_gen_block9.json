    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a part of a larger system that controls and modifies the values of `hdata` on every rising edge of the clock signal `clk_i`. It sets the bit values of the array `hdata` according to its index `i`. The indexes are multiples of the constant `NUM_DQ_PINS` and this design pattern indicates that this block is designed to work with quadrature data pins. In each period, if the index `i` matches the `SEL_VICTIM_LINE` or its derivates, or belongs to certain ranges, the specific `hdata[i]` element will be set to either `1'b1` or `1'b0` after a delay of `TCQ`. In any other case, `hdata[i]` will be set to `1'b1`. The entire process is a part of a loop that iterates over the range 0 to 4*`NUM_DQ_PINS` - 1, implementing parallel operations for multiple data pins."
