    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to assign specific status bits to the 'MIISTATUSOut' output signal of a Media Independent Interface (MII) in an Ethernet compatible device. The signal 'MIISTATUSOut' is a 32-bit wide output signal, with higher bits assigned to zero. The three least significant bits of 'MIISTATUSOut' are respectively assigned with the results of 'LinkFail', 'Busy_stat' and 'NValid_stat' signals. The 'LinkFail' signal indicates if the Ethernet link has failed, the 'Busy_stat' signal determines whether the MII is busy or not, and 'NValid_stat' indicates the valid status of the data obtained from the MII."
