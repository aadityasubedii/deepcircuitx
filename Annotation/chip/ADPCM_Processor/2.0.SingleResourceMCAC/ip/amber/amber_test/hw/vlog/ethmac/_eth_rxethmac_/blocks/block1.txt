This block of code manages the logic for ending a frame in a receiver circuit working on clock `MRxClk` or a reset signal `Reset`. During a reset condition, the `RxEndFrm_d` and `RxEndFrm` signals are set to `0` after a propagation delay specified by `#Tp`. Otherwise, `RxEndFrm_d` gets the value of `GenerateRxEndFrm` and `RxEndFrm` is the logical OR of `RxEndFrm_d` and `DribbleRxEndFrm`, both after a propagation delay. This resets the receiver end frame flags during a reset condition and sets them based on given conditions otherwise.
