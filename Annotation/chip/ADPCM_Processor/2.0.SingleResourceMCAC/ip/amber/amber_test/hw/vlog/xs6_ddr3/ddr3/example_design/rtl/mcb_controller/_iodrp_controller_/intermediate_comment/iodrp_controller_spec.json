The module's core functionality lies in managing read/write operations and includes a broadcasting feature, driven by a finite-state machine (FSM). \n\nThe input ports for the iodrp_controller module are: 'memcell_address' which provides the memory cell address for read/write operations, 'write_data' for writing data to a memory cell, 'rd_not_write' to determine read or write operations, 'cmd_valid' and 'use_broadcast' to enable broadcasting mode, 'sync_rst' to reset synchronously, and 'DRP_CLK' and 'DRP_SDO' for clock and serial data output.\n\nThe output ports are 'read_data' carrying data read from a memory cell, 'rdy_busy_n' showing the status (ready or busy) of the controller, 'DRP_CS', 'DRP_SDI', 'DRP_ADD', and 'DRP_BKST' which act as various DRP control signals.\n\nThe module uses internal signals: 'memcell_addr_reg', 'data_reg', 'shift_through_reg', 'load_shift_n', 'addr_data_sel_n', 'bit_cnt', 'rd_not_write_reg', 'AddressPhase', 'state', and 'nextstate'. These signals are used for storing and transferring data, controlling the system flow, and managing the different states of the FSM operation.\n\nThe iodrp_controller module is divided into different sections of code blocks. Each block is responsible for managing the module's functionality. They include: data reading and writing, controlling mux and FSM operations, managing input and output port signals, and setting/resetting operations.\n\nBy providing clear understanding and organization of Verilog code structure, the iodrp_controller module illustrates the effective use of FSM along with the controller operational signals in building complex hardware systems."
