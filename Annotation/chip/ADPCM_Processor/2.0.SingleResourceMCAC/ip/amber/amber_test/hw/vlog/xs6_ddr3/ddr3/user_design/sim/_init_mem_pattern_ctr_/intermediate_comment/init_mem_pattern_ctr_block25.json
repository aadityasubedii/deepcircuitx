    "block_comment": "This block of code is a conditionally generated block that checks if a constant named 'FAMILY' has the value 'SPARTAN6'. If the evaluation is true, the hardware described within the instantiation (INC_COUNTS_S) will be synthesized and included in the design. This is typically used in FPGA designs to conditionally enable or disable blocks of hardware based on the targeted FPGA family. The code for the hardware to be synthesized within this block is not shown."
