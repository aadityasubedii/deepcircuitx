    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for calling the function `dq_timing_check(35)` whenever there is a change in the 36th bit (considering 0 as starting index) of the `dq_in` signal. It exploits the sensitivity list feature of the 'always' block in Verilog, which triggers a function call to `dq_timing_check(35)` applying the parameter `35` in response to any alterations in bit 35 of `dq_in`."
