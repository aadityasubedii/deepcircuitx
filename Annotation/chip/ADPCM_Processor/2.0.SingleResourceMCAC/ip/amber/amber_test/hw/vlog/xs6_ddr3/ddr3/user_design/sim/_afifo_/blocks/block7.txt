The block assigns the difference between wr_capture_ptr and rd_ptr to buf_filled. As wr_capture_ptr likely represents the write pointer and rd_ptr the read pointer in a buffer, this assignment calculates the amount of data currently held in the buffer. It achieves this using an arithmetic operation, by subtracting the value at the read pointer from the value at the write pointer capture. If wr_capture_ptr is ahead of rd_ptr, buf_filled will hold a positive value representing the quantity of stored data.
