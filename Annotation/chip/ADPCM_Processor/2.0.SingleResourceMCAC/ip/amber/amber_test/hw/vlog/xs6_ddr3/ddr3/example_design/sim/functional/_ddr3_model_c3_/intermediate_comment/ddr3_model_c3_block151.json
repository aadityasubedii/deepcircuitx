    "block_comment": "This block of code ensures timing constraints for command address signals in a digital design. The Verilog 'always' statement is used here to continuously monitor changes in the 14th bit of the 'addr_in' signal. When the bit changes, it triggers the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function with an argument of 20, which presumably checks and maintains the proper timing parameters for the command address signals. The precise implementation of 'cmd_addr_timing_check' is not provided in this excerpt."
