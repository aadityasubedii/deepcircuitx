Comment: 
This block of Verilog code assigns the output signal `interrupt_mode` based on the value of `next_interrupt`. The signal `interrupt_mode` indicates the type of impending interrupt and is used for coordinating system responses. If `next_interrupt` is 2, it assigns `FIRQ`, if it is 3, it assigns `IRQ`. If `next_interrupt` is in the range of 4 to 7, or equal to 1, `SVC` is assigned to `interrupt_mode`. For any other values, `USR` is assigned as the default.
