    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a control function to reset or flag a empty state of a memory control block (MCB) read operation. When a positive edge clock signal is detected, the block first checks if the reset condition (rst_ra[0]) is true. If so, this block sets the mcb_rd_empty_r flag to true asynchronously. If the reset condition is not met, it then checks if the MCB read FIFO counts value is less or equal to 1, and if so, it sets the mcb_rd_empty_r flag to true. If neither conditions are satisfied, it sets the mcb_rd_empty_r flag to false, indicating the MCB read operation is not empty."
