This block of code monitors and handles FIFO (First In, First Out) errors in a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) system. Specifically, it detects and warns about underflows and overflows in tx and rx FIFOs. It does this by checking certain conditions on every positive edge of the input clock (`i_clk`). When rx FIFO underflow (reading when empty) or overflow (writing when full) is detected, it writes a warning message and continues. Similarly, for tx FIFO overflow (writing when full), a similar warning message is displayed along with the value that tried to push into the FIFO.
