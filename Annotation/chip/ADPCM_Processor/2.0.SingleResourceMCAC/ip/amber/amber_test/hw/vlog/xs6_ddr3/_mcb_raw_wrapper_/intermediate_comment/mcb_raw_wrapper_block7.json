    "block_comment": "This block of code carries out the function of selecting an On-Die Terminating (ODT) resistor for memory interfaces based on configuration parameters provided. Depending on whether the memory type is DDR3 or DDR2, it checks whether the termination resistance option is turned on or off. In the case of DDR3, it even checks if the dynamic write ODT is switched on. Only if they are switched on, it generates the block `gen_dram_odt` which instances `OBUFT`, a tristate output buffer with the output `mcbx_dram_odt`, input `ioi_odt`, and the tristate control `t_odt`."
