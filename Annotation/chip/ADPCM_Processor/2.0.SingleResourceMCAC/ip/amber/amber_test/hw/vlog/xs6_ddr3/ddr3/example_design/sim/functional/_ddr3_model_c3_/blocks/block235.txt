Comment: 
This code block is a delay function for DDR signal sampling in Verilog. Implemented using always trigger on changes in either dqs or dqs_n signals, it assigns a delay of BUS_DELAY time unit value to dqs_in. The input signals, dqs_n and dqs, are concatenated with dqs_n shifted by 16 bits to the left. This serves to synchronize the differential signaling for improved noise immunity in DDR.
