This block of code deploys a binary counter. It employs the 14th and 13th bits of 'wait_200us_counter' as a signal. On the positive edge of 'ui_clk', if the 14th and 13th bits are high, 'wait_200us_done_r1' is set to 1, otherwise, it is reset to 0. Furthermore, 'wait_200us_done_r1''s value is transferred to 'wait_200us_done_r2' on every clock cycle.
