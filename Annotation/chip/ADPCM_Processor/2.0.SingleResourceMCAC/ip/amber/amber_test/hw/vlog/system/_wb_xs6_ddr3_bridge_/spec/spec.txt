Module name: wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge. 

Module specification: The wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge module functions as a bridge facilitating conversion of Wishbone (WB) bus protocols to DDR3 memory read and write commands, effectively helping in memory access operations. This module is a highly versatile component, designed to handle both 32 bit and 128 bit data widths.

The input ports, i_clk, i_mem_ctrl, i_wb_adr, i_wb_sel, i_wb_we, i_wb_dat, i_wb_cyc, i_wb_stb, i_cmd_full, i_wr_full, i_rd_data, and i_rd_empty, are used to control the read and write operations of the memory, to input data and address, and to handle the bus cycles and protocols of the Wishbone system respectively. The output ports, o_wb_dat, o_wb_ack, o_wb_err, o_cmd_en, o_cmd_instr, o_cmd_byte_addr, o_wr_en, o_wr_mask, and o_wr_data, send commands to DDR3 memory, handle write operations to the write queue, and return data from read operations as well as acknowledge successful transactions.

Internally, the module maintains several signals for coordinating the operational flow. The write_request and read_request are wires that help in initiating read and write processes when certain conditions are met. Register-based signals like write_request_r and read_request_r capture the status of these requests. The module employs a large number of registers (e.g., cmd_en_r, wr_en_r, wb_adr_r) to hold state, address, and control information, and to buffer data when the command queue is full. 

The code of the module is divided into several distinct blocks that handle different aspects of the module's operation. The first block, always @( posedge i_clk ), handles the memory control signal updates. The second block, always @( posedge i_clk ), controls the command enable, command instruction, and byte address for memory. The following blocks, built with conditional generate constructs, handle data width specific operations for bot 32-bit and 128-bit Wishbone systems, with separate sections to manage reading and writing data. Lastly, the always @( posedge i_clk ) block handles read/write command queues, active read status, and read acknowledgements.

The detailed specification of this module provides a thorough understanding of its operation, effectively mapping the Wishbone to DDR3 memory access commands, and handling a wide variety of bus transactions and memory management tasks in a system-on-chip design.
