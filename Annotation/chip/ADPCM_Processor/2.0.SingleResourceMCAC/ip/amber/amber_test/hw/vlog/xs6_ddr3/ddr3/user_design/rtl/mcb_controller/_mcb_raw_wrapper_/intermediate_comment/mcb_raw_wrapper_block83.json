    "block_comment": "The block of code reacts to any changes in its conditionals and checks if the configuration of port 2 (C_PORT_CONFIG[119:96]) is \"W32\" (indicating a write-only port), if the enable signal (p2_cmd_en) is high (1'b1), and if the command instruction (p2_cmd_instr) for port 2 is not matching the valid instruction for a write operation. If all these conditions are met, it triggers an error message, indicating that a wrong or invalid command is being sent to this write-only port 2, and finally halts the simulation. The error detection mechanism here uses the `$display` and `$finish` system tasks of Verilog which are used respectively for displaying the error message and terminating the simulation."
