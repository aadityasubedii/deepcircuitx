Comment: 
This Verilog code is primarily dedicated to clock signal conditioning based on the input clock type. If the input clock type is differential (C_INPUT_CLK_TYPE == "DIFFERENTIAL"), the code block instantiates an IBUFGDS instance (a differential input buffer with failsafe for clock signals). It conditions the differential input clock signals (sys_clk_p as positive, sys_clk_n as negative) and provides the buffered clock (sys_clk_ibufg) for further use. If the input clock type is single-ended, however, the described block does not perform any actions. Unique labels ("diff_input_clk" and "se_input_clk") for these blocks make the function of each block more understandable.
