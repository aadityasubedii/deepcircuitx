This block defines an always block, processing on every positive edge of the i_clk signal. It manages the values of a 'firq_timer' register based on different conditions. When 'wb_start_write' is active and the 16 bit address 'i_wb_adr' equals 'AMBER_TEST_FIRQ_TIMER', the 8 least significant bits of 'wb_wdata32' are assigned to 'firq_timer'. Otherwise, if 'firq_timer' is greater than 1, it is decremented by 1.
