    "block_comment": "This block of code is a specific condition checking in a cache memory system to check if it's working in 4-way set associative mode. It is part of an else-if statement, and therefore operates conditionally based on the value of 'WAYS'. If 'WAYS' equals 4, the block of code following this statement will be executed, which is typically expected to manage the cache operations for a 4-way set associative cache."
