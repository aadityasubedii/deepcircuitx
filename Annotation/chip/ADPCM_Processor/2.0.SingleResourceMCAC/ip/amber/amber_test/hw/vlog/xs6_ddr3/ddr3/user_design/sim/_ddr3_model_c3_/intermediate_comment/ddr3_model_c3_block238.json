    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for modeling a delay in the bus system. The function is achieved by using an 'always' block, a common construct in Verilog which specifies actions that must occur upon every change of specified signals. In this case, the event trigger is changes to 'addr'. Upon this event trigger, the delay '#BUS_DELAY' will be applied to 'addr', and the resulting value will be assigned to the signal 'addr_in'."
