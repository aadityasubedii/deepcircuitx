This block of code performs the task of writing a termination value to a specific pin called UDQS_PIN and then sets up the circuit to await the completion of this write operation. It implements this by assigning the termination value (`PTerm`), the mode (`WRITE_MODE`), and the write data (`P_Term_s`) to the appropriate control registers. It then assigns the "UDQS_PIN" to `MCB_UIADDR` and validates the memory command buffer (MCB) by setting `MCB_CMD_VALID` to 1. Depending on the condition of memory command buffer readiness (`MCB_RDY_BUSY_N`), it either continues to write the termination value or switches to a wait state, changing the state of the circuit accordingly.
