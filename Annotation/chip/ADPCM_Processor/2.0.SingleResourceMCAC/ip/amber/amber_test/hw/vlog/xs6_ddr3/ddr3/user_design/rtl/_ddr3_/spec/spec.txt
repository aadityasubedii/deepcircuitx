Module name: ddr3. Module specification: This module implements a DDR3 SDRAM memory controller with configurable parameters for memory timing, size, and interface settings. It provides multiple command, write, and read ports (p0-p5) for interacting with the DDR3 memory. The module has numerous input and output ports, including system clock and reset inputs, DDR3 memory interface signals, and multiple command/data ports for read/write operations. Key inputs include c3_sys_clk, c3_sys_rst_i, and various command/data signals for each port. Outputs include DDR3 memory control signals, status indicators, and read data. Internal signals manage clock generation, reset control, and memory controller operations. The module consists of two main blocks: an infrastructure block for clock management and a memory controller wrapper that handles memory operations, including initialization, refresh, and access, while abstracting low-
