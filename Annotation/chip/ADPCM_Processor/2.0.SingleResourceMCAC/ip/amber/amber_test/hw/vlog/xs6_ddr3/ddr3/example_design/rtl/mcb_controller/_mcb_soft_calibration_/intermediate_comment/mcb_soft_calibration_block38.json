    "block_comment": "This block is used as part of a state machine to wait for certain conditions to be fulfilled before transitioning to the next state. The implemented conditions are that the Memory Controller Block (MCB) is not busy (`!MCB_RDY_BUSY_N`) and that the first in term (potentially a processing step or data input) is completed (`First_In_Term_Done`). If MCB is busy, the state machine stays in the 'WAIT6' state, and if the first term is done, it considers moving forward from this state based on other logic not shown in this code block."
