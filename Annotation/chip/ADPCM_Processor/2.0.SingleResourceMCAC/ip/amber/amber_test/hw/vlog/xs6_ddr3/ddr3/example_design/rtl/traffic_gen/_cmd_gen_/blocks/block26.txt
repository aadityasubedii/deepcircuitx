This block of code provides data output address calculation with specific delay timing in a synchronous behavior. The calculation is achieved by subtracting the product of 'DWIDTH/8' and 'fixed_bl_i' from 'end_addr_i', and then adding 1, all in every positive edge of the 'clk_i' cycle. This calculation is only valid for the duration specified by 'TCQ', which is a timing control parameter.
