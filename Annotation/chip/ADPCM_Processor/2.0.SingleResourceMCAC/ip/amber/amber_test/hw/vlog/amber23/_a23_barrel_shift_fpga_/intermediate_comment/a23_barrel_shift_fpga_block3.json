    "block_comment": "The block assigns a 31-bit output (`o_out`) based on a combination of bitwise operations involving two 31-bit input signals (`p_l` and `p_r`) and a manipulative mask (`lsl_mask`, `lsr_mask` and `asr_sign`). Bitwise AND operation is performed between `p_l` and `lsl_mask`, and `p_r` and `lsr_mask`, whose results are then combined using a bitwise OR operation. For the remaining bits, where `lsr_mask` is not set, bitwise AND operation is performed between the negation of `lsr_mask` and `asr_sign` repeated 31 times, and further incorporated using bitwise OR operation. The block achieves bit manipulation including logical shift left, logical shift right and arithmetic shift right."
