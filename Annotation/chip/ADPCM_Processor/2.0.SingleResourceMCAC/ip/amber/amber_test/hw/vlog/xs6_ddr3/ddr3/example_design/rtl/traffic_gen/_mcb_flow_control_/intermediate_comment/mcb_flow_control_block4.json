    "block_comment": "This particular Verilog RTL code block is part of a command read module. It checks whether a read command has been issued and is awaiting processing. On each rising edge of the input clock (`clk_i`), it examines if both a read command (`cmd_rd`) and push command (`push_cmd`) have been issued. If so, it sets a read command pending flag `cmd_rd_pending_r1` to 1 after a delay of `#TCQ`. If a transfer command (`xfer_cmd`) has been issued, the same flag is set to 0 after the `#TCQ` delay, indicating a previous read command has been processed or is no longer valid.\n"
