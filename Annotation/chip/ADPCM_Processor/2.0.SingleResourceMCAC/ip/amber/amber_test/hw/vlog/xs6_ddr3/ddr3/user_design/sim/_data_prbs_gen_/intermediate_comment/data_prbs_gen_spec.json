It drives the LFSR to generate the pseudo-random binary sequence.\n2. clk_en: This is the clock enable input. When this signal is high, the LFSR operates normally. When this signal is low, the LFSR pauses its operation.\n3. rst_i: This is the reset input. When this signal is high, it resets the LFSR and loads it with a predefined seed.\n4. prbs_fseed_i: This 32-bit fixed seed input gets added to prbs_seed_i to form the initial loading value for the LFSR.\n5. prbs_seed_init: When this is high, the LFSR is reseeded with the value of {prbs_seed_i + prbs_fseed_i[31:0] + 32'h55555555}.\n6. prbs_seed_i: This is the seed input for the PRBS generator.
