    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a timing checker for the negative edge of the 'dqs_in[2]' signal. It invokes the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function every time there is a falling edge on the 'dqs_in[2]' signal, keeping track of the timing accuracy of this specific signal transitioning from high (1) to low (0). This implementation details are encapsulated within the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function, to which the index '2' is passed as an argument."
