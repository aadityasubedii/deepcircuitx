    "block_comment": "This block assigns conditions for setting and decrementing a pause timer in a networking application. The `SetPauseTimer` signal is set to high when a packet ends, a pause frame with an address has been received, the packet is good, its length is okay, and there's flow control in the receive direction. The `DecrementPauseTimer` is triggered when a time slot has finished and the PauseTimer has at least one bit set to 1."
