The block assigns the logical OR between PadIn and SendingCtrlFrm to PadOut. It means that if either PadIn or SendingCtrlFrm are active (signifying an incoming frame or the control frame being sent), then PadOut will be active. This makes PadOut represent the combined activity of PadIn and SendingCtrlFrm.
