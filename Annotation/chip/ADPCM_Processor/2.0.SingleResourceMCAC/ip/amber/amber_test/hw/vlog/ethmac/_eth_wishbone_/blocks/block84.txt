This Verilog block is responsible for managing data transmission based on specific conditions. Upon a positive edge of MTxClk or a reset, the block initially resets TxData if a reset is detected. However, if a transmission start frame is beginning, it portions out sections of the TxData_wb based on the least significant bits of the TxPointer, thus transmitting the data in byte-sized chunks. If the start frame and used data flags are set and the pointer's LSBs are '3', it sends the highest byte of TxData_wb. For other used data conditions, it switches the data source to TxDataLatched and transmits the data byte-wise based on the value of TxByteCnt.
