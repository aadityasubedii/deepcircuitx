Comment: 
This Verilog block is designed to control a write data counter, which is dictated by clock inputs and other control signals. Upon every positive edge of the clock (denoted as clk_i), it checks if the reset condition (dcount_rst) is activated. If it is, the write data count (wr_data_counts) is set to zero, effectively resetting the counter. If not reset, but a 'write enable' signal (mcb_wr_en) is received, it increments the write data counter (wr_data_counts) by a value proportional to the Data Width divided by eight (DWIDTH/8). This increment of counter holds for each clock cycle when the 'write enable' signal is high.
