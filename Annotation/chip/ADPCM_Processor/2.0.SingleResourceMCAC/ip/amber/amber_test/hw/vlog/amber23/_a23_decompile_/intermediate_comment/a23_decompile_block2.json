    "block_comment": "The function `numchars` calculates the number of characters present in an input instruction. This is achieved by comparing different length substrings, starting from the most significant side of the input `xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE`, with empty strings of varying number of spaces. Depending upon the match, it assigns the number of characters to `numchars`. For instance, if the entire instruction equals an empty string of four spaces, `numchars` would contain the digit '1'. As we move towards the least significant side in the absence of previous matches, the digit assigned to `numchars` increases by one. If none of the substrings matches, '5' is assigned to indicate that the instruction contains 5 characters."
