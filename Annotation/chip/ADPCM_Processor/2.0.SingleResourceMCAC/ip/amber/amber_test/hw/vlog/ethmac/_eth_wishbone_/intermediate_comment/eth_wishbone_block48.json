    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the count of bytes received in a certain hardware communication protocol. This count is updated on the rising edge of MRxClk signal or upon a Reset signal. If Reset is active or if the receiving process is either aborted (RxAbort) or shift operation ends (ShiftEnded_rck), the byte count (RxByteCnt) is reset to 0. If a valid signal is received (RxValid) together with a start frame signal (RxStartFrm) and a ready signal (RxReady), the byte count is incremented in a cyclic manner from 0 to 3 based on the lower two bits of the receive pointer (RxPointerLSB_rst). If a valid receive signal is inside an enabled window or the last byte has been received (LastByteIn), the byte count is incremented by 1."
