Comment: 
This block of code operates a flip-flop that triggers on the positive edge of the signal `dqs_odd[10]`. The flip-flop subsequently calls the function `dqs_odd_receiver()` with the argument 10. The function `dqs_odd_receiver()` is not described within this block, yet it is implied that it performs some operation in response to the signal `dqs_odd[10]` changing from a low voltage state to a high voltage state.
