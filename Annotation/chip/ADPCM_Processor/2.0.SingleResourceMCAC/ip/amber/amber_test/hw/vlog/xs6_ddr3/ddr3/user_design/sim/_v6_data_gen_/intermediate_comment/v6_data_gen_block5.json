    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code manages dynamic update of memory addresses. It primarily updates a 36-bit 'acounts' variable with the 'addr_i' input or previously stored 'acounts' value based on different input flag conditions on clock's positive edge. When the 'cmd_startD' flag is high, it loads 'addr_i' input into 'acounts' after appending zeros to its front to make it 36-bit. If 'cmd_startD' is low but 'data_rdy_i', 'fifo_rdy_i' are high and 'MEM_BURST_LEN' is 8, it increments 'acounts' based on 'NUM_DQ_PINS' value, providing a means to handle different data path widths. It uses the '#TCQ' delay control to state the delay before next operation."
