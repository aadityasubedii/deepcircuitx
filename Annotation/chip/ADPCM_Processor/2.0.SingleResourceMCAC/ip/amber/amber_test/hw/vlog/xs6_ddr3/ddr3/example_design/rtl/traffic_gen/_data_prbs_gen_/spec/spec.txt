Module name: data_prbs_gen. 

Module specification: The 'data_prbs_gen' module is a parameterized Pseudorandom Binary Sequence (PRBS) generator that uses a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) for PRBS generation. The generated PRBS can be used for different purposes like testing and debugging. 

Input ports include 'clk_i' for clock input to process operations; 'clk_en' signal to decide whether the clock will have an effect; 'rst_i' to reset the LFSR; 'prbs_fseed_i' as a 32-bit input to fine-tune the seed of the PRBS; 'prbs_seed_init' to setup the initial seed for the PRBS and 'prbs_seed_i' is an array signal input carrying the PRBS seed data or initial value of the LFSR. 

The module has one output port 'prbs_o', which is an array signal output that provides the generated pseudorandom binary sequence for further use. 

Internal signals used include 'prbs' which is a register array that holds the generated PRBS; 'lfsr_q' which is an array that represents the LFSR and is used for the generation of the pseudorandom sequence, and 'i', an integer, unused in the current version of the code. 

The module's operation can be distinctly divided into two sections: one handles the seeding and resetting of the LFSR based on params 'prbs_seed_init', 'EYE_TEST', and 'rst_i'. The second section, on clock enable 'clk_en', updates the LFSR based on a logic and produces an output 'prbs_o' that reflects the states of the LFSR. A standalone section assigns the shifted LFSR values to the 'prbs' which will then be assigned to output 'prbs_o' for externa use.
