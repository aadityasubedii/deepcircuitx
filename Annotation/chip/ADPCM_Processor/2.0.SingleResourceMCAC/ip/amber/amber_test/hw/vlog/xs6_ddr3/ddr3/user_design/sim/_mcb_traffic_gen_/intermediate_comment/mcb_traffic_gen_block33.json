    "block_comment": "This line of code is responsible for assigning the signal `mcb_rd_empty` the value of `mcb_rd_empty_i`. The implementation is achieved through the Verilog `assign` keyword, which is used here to continuously assign the value of the input condition `mcb_rd_empty_i` to the signal `mcb_rd_empty`. This ensures that whenever the value of `mcb_rd_empty_i` changes, the change is reflected in `mcb_rd_empty`."
