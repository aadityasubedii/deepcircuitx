Comment: 
This block is a clocked behavior block for latching the RxAbort signal. A rising edge trigger either resets (posedge of 'wb_rst_i') the latch to 0 or updates it based on various conditions: when RxAbort signal is received, when both ShortFrame and negation of r_RecSmall are true, and/or when LatchedMRxErr and negation of InvalidSymbol occur or when ReceivedPauseFrm signal and negation of r_PassAll occur, the latch is set to 1, otherwise, if RxAbortRst is true, the latch is reset to 0. The latch value is updated after a delay specified by #Tp.
