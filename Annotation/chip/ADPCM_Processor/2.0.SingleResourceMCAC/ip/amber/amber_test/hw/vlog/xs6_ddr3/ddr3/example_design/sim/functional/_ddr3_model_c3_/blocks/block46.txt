This block of code defines a function that monitors for a negative edge on the 20th bit of a Digital Quad SPI (DQS) signal. The process in this block of code is triggered whenever the 20th bit of the DQS has a 'falling' or negative edge and subsequently calls the dqs_pos_timing_check function with the parameter 19. This function likely checks for proper timings of the signals based on the generation of negative edges on the DQS input line.
