    "block_comment": "This block of code is a task for writing data into memory. It accepts bank, row, col and data as inputs to determine the location and content in memory to write into. If the MAX_MEM macro is defined, it concatenates row and col, divides the result by BL_MAX to get the memory address, and writes the data into the memory using the write_to_file function. If MAX_MEM is not defined, it concatenates bank, row and col, divides the result by BL_MAX to get the address. Depending on whether the address exists or the memory is full, the code either writes the data into existing memory, displays an error message or creates a new address to save the data and update the \"memory_used\" counter."
