Comment: 
This block defines a counter to track the number of bits processed during the ADDR_PHASE or DATA_PHASE of the design, reset by a synchronous reset signal. On the positive edge of DRP_CLK, if the current state is either ADDR_PHASE or DATA_PHASE and synchronous reset is not asserted, the counter (bit_cnt) will increment by one. If these conditions are not satisfied, bit_cnt will reset to zero.
