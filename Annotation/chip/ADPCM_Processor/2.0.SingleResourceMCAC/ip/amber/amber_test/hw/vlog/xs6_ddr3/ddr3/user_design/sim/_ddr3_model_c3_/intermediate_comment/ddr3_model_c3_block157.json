    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a function that triggers a timing check of the command address whenever the 7th bit of incoming address, 'addr_in', changes. It makes use of always@(addr_in[7]) to monitor the changing of the 7th bit and whenever a change is detected, it calls the cmd_addr_timing_check function with a parameter of 14 to start the timing check process. Thus it ensures the synchronous evaluation and assures the data integrity and accuracy of command address within the Verilog code context."
