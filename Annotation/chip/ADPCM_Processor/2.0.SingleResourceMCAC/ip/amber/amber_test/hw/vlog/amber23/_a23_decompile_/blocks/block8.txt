Comment: 
The block performs the task of writing the name of a register to a decompilation file based on the register number input. The implementation is divided into two cases: for a register number less than 12, the function writes the register number directly to the decompilation file, while for 12 and higher, it translates register numbers to corresponding predefined register names (ip, sp, lr, pc) and writes these names to the file.
