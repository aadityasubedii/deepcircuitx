The block of Verilog code is for managing a self-refresh sequence under system reset or clock signal. When signaled with a system reset, this code block resets three registers selfrefresh_enter_r1, selfrefresh_enter_r2, and selfrefresh_enter_r3 to low signal (0). In the absence of a system reset, at the positive edge of the clock signal (ui_clk), the code pipeline shifts the value of the selfrefresh_enter through the three aforementioned registers from r1 to r2 to r3.
