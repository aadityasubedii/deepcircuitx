    "block_comment": "The block of code is a conditional hardware generator for a memory controller interface using Verilog. If the C_S1_AXI_ENABLE is disabled (0), it signifies direct connections between input and output signals in the module within the block labeled as P1_UI_MCB. On the other hand, if C_S1_AXI_ENABLE is enabled (not 0), an AXI memory controller block interface is instantiated within the block titled as P1_UI_AXI. A synchronization module (mcb_ui_top_synch) for calibration and an AXI memory controller module (axi_mcb) with specified configuration parameters are instantiated and their ports are configured too. The axi_mcb interfaces with both AXI bus and the custom mcb bus, it allows access to memory through AXI bus while handling underflow, overflow, error conditions at the mcb end."
