    "block_comment": "This block of code behaves like a counter that increments every positive edge of the input clock signal. On each rising edge of the clk_i signal, the variable INC_COUNTS is assigned a value equivalent to the system DWIDTH divided by eight. This block essentially keeps incrementing INC_COUNTS at every clock cycle."
