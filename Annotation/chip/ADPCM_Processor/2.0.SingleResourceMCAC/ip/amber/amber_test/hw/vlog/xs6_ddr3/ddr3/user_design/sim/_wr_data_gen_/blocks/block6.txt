The function of this block is to control the readiness state of a certain command based on different conditions and inputs. It does this by updating the command readiness signal, cmd_rdyE, on every rising edge clock cycle. First, it checks for a reset signal, and if that exists it makes the cmd_rdyE signal ready. If there's no reset, the block then checks if a start command is given. In this scenario, if a specific input bl_i is true, then cmd_rdyE signal is set to ready otherwise it is not. The exception is an operation related to the user burst count and the status of the FIFO, where it sets the cmd_rdyE signal ready, if this specific condition is met. The cmd_rdyE is implemented using non-blocking assignments to avoid race conditions.
