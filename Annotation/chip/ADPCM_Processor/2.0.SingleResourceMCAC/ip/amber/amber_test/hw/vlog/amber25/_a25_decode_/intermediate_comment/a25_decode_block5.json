    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is an always-block driven by the positive edges of both reset and clock signals. It handles resetting of all immediate state variables when a reset signal is received, sets these variables to a state of zero. On the other hand, if there's no reset, it checks for core stall and conflict conditions. If neither condition is present, the block fetches the next instruction, type and address, updates exception registers and sets other register states based on the current state of the hardware. It performs manipulations based on the current instruction and sets the values of other control and data variables. With its nested control flow, it primarily serves as a state update unit in a processor execution cycle."
