The block of code is a function to compute and return the nominal round-trip delay time (RTT_NOM) based on the given input. It receives a 3-bit input, uses a case statement to determine the corresponding RTT_NOM value according to the input. The RTT_NOM value is calculated by dividing a constant, RZQ, by different numbers based on the input value, returning 0 as default if the input doesn't match with any of the predefined cases.
