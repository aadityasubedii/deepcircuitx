This block of code governs the enablement of read or write commands in a sequential circuit based on certain conditions. Upon a positive edge of the clock signal, it checks if the reset signal is active, if so, it sets 'cmd_rdyC' flag high. Alternatively, if the start command is signaled and depending on the value of signal 'bl_i', it appropriately sets the 'cmd_rdyC' flag high or low. Additionally, if the user defined burst count equals 2 and the FIFO buffer is not full, the 'cmd_rdyC' again is set to high; enabling data transactions.
