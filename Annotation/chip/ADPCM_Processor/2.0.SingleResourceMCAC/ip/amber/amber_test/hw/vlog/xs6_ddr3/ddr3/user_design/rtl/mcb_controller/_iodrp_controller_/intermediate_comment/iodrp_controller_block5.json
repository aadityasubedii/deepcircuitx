    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic that updates the flag `AddressPhase` based on the system state and the bit count. Using a positive edge clocking scheme, it resets the 'AddressPhase' flag during the synchronization reset. The block checks if the system is in the 'ALMOST_READY' state when 'AddressPhase' is true, and updates 'AddressPhase' accordingly. Alternatively, when 'AddressPhase' is false, it checks if the system is in the 'ADDR_PHASE' state and the bit count equals to 7 (3'b111), it then updates the 'AddressPhase'. This ensures a smooth transition between different states while addressing."
