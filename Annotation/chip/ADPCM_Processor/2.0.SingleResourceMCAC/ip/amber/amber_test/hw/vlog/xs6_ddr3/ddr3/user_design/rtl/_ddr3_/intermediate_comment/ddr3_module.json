    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a DDR3 SDRAM memory controller with multiple configurable ports. It instantiates infrastructure and memory controller wrapper submodules to manage clock generation, reset control, and memory operations. The controller handles initialization, refresh, and access while providing an abstracted interface for DDR3 memory interactions through multiple command, write, and read ports (p0-p5). It supports various memory sizes, timings, and interface settings, abstracting low-level DDR3 protocol details from the user."
