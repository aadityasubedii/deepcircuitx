Comment: 
This block is primarily a flip-flop setup that is bitmap controlled, ensuring synchronization with the designated system clock (`WB_CLK_I`) or with a reset signal. The flip-flop is reset in response to the `Reset` signal going high; otherwise, the previous state (`SyncRxStartFrm_q`) is retained.
