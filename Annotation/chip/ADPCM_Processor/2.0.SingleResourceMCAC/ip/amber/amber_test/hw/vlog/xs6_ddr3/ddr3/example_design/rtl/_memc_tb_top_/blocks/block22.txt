This block checks for enabled ports and assigns comparison data accordingly. Depending on which port is enabled (as indicated by the C_PORT_ENABLE flag), it assigns the appropriate comparison data (cmp_data) and data validity (cmp_data_valid) from that port. The design makes use of Verilog's `generate` and `if` constructs to dynamically adjust the assignments based on the active port.
