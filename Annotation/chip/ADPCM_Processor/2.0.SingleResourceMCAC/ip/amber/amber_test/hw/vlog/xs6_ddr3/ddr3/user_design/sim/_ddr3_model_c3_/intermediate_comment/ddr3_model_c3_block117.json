    "block_comment": "The block of code is a sensitivity list clause in Verilog, which triggers an event-driven procedure. Specifically, it activates the function dq_timing_check with '13' as an argument whenever there's a change in the 14th element of the dq_in array. This approach ensures dynamic monitoring and response to changes in specified parts of the design."
