    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the activation of a write operation into a memory or register. This write operation is enabled when the system is not stalling (when `i_core_stall` is false). More specifically, the '`assign`' keyword in Verilog is used to create combinational logic and in this case it's creating a logic gate that negates the value of `i_core_stall` and assigns it to `write_enable_update`, effectively making `write_enable_update` true when the system is running smoothly and false when the system is stalling.\n"
