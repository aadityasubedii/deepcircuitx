Comment: 
This block generates the delay in the ODT (On-Die Termination) signal. By using the non-blocking assignment (`<=`) with a delay parameter (`#BUS_DELAY`), the block replicates a propagation delay scenario in a hardware bus line for the `odt` signal. This simulates the bus delay behaviour in actual physical systems in a digital environment.
