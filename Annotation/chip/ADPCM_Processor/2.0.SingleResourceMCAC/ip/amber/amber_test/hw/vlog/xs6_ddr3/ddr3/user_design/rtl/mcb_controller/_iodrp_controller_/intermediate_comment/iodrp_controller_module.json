    "module": "Module-level comment: Module \"iodrp_controller\" manages a memory cell's read/write operations leveraging an internal FSM. It utilizes control signals to dictate the flow between distinct states, effectively processing data and addresses with shift registers and counters. There are special provisions for broadcasting (DRP_BKST), synchronization (DRP_CLK), and resetting (sync_rst), supporting diverse operational requirements. Debugging is facilitated via a state_ascii signal representing the current FSM state in ASCII values."
