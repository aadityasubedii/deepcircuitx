Comment: 
The given Verilog RTL code block is responsible for controlling a soft calibration self-refresh request (soft_cal_selfrefresh_req) signal. This is implemented through an edge-triggered process, which activates at every positive edge of the UI clock (ui_clk). If the system reset signal (sys_rst) is high, it clears the self-refresh request flag. However, if the control flag for entering self-refresh mode (selfrefresh_enter_r3) is high, it sets the self-refresh request signal. When exiting from self-refresh mode and the Phase-Locked-Loop (pll_lock) is locked, the self-refresh request flag is cleared again. In all other cases, the self-refresh request remains unchanged.
