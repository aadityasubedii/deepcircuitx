    "block_comment": "This block initializes the command strings corresponding to different operation modes in a digital memory system. Specifically, it maps predefined constants representing command codes such as LOAD_MODE, REFRESH, PRECHARGE, and others to textual string representations for readability and debugging purposes. The strings are the human-readable equivalents of the operation modes that the memory system can be in, enabling easier analysis during simulation and troubleshooting."
