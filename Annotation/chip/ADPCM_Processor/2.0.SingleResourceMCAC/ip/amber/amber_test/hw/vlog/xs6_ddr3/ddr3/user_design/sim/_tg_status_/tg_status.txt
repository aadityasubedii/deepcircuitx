Module-level comment: The 'tg_status' module monitors and logs data error conditions in a system. Using inputs like data error, comparison data, read data, comparison address, block length, and buffer statuses, the module captures detailed error status when an error occurs and no previous error is stored. This status is recorded in 'error_status' register, and an 'error_set' flag is updated. Further errors are ignored until a reset signal or manual clear error is received. All operations are clock-synchronized.
