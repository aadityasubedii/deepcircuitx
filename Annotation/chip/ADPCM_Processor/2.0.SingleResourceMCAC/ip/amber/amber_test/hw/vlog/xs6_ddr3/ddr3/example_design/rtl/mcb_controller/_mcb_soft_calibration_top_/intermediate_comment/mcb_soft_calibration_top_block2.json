    "block_comment": "This block of code sets hardware registers to a default state upon system reset. Using an 'always' block that is triggered by either a positive edge of the UI_CLK (User Interface Clock) or the RST (Reset), the block resets the values of the four registers (ZIO_IN_R1, ZIO_IN_R2, RZQ_IN_R1, RZQ_IN_R2) to '0'. This ensures that these registers are in a known and predictable state upon system reset, clearing any previous data."
