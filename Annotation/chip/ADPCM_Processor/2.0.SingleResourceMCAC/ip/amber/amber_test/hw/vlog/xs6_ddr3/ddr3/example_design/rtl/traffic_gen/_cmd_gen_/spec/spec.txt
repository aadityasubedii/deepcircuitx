Module name: cmd_gen. Module specification: The cmd_gen module is a command generator for memory interface operations, designed to generate read, write, and refresh commands with associated addresses and burst lengths. It supports various modes of operation, including fixed, sequential, and pseudo-random (PRBS) patterns for address generation and instruction selection. The module takes inputs such as clk_i (clock), rst_i (reset), run_traffic_i (run signal), and various configuration signals for address, data, and instruction modes. It outputs addr_o (address), instr_o (instruction), bl_o (burst length), and cmd_o_vld (command valid signal). Internally, it uses signals like addr_counts (address counter), prbs_addr (PRBS-generated address), and instr_out (instruction output) to manage command generation. The module is divided into sections for address generation, instruction selection, burst length
