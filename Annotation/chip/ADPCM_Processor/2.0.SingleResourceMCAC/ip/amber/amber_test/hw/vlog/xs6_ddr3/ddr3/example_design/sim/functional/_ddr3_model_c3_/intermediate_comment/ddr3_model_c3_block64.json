    "block_comment": "The block triggers a DQS Positive Edge Timing Check on the second element of the DQS input signal array. The always keyword ensures that the check is executed with every positive edge (rising edge) of the signal DQS_in at index 1. This efficient implementation guarantees real-time detection of any timing violations."
