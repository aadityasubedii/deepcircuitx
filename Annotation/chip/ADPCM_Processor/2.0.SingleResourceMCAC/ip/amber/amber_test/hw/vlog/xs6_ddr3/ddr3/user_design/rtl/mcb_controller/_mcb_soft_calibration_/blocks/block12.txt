The block is designed for synchronization during self-refresh modes in memory control blocks (MCBs). The logic signal `WAIT_SELFREFRESH_EXIT_DQS_CAL` indicates whether the system should wait for a dynamic calibration after exiting self-refresh mode. When there's a reset, this flag is turned off. During self-refresh mode transition, the flag is turned on. It turns off again when a dynamic calibration is performed after exiting self-refresh. The conditions are checked at every positive edge of the user interface clock (`UI_CLK`).
