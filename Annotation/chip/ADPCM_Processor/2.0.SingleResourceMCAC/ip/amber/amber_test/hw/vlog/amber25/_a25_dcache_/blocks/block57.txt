Comment: 
The provided block of code performs a cache hit detection operation in a write-back caching mechanism. The `wb_hit` signal becomes high when the input address (`i_address`) matches the write-back address (`wb_address`), the write-back cache is ready (`i_wb_cached_ready`), and the fill state is true (implying the cache block is filled with valid data). This operation is implemented using an 'assign' statement in Verilog, which continuously evaluates the conditions and assigns the result to `wb_hit` in the case of a logical match.
