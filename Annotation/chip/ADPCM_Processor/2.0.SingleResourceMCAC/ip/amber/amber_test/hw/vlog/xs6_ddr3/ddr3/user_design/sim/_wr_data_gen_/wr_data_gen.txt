Module-level comment: The wr_data_gen module generates data for write processes in memory controllers for SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 FPGA families. Inputs control data generation modes, commands and associated parameters, with outputs signaling command readiness, data validity, the generated data itself, and the end of write processes. Internal registers track command readiness, data validity, and the count of user burst. Data flow is controlled by several always blocks and two specific SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 data generation sub-modules, determined by the FAMILY parameter, handle the actual data generation.
