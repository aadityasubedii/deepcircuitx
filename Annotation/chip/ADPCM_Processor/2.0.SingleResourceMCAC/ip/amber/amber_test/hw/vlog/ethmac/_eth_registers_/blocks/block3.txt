Comment: 
This block of code manages an interrupt request (irq_rxc) on the positive edge of a clock (Clk) or a reset (Reset). If the Reset is high, irq_rxc is immediately cleared. In the absence of a reset, if SetRxCIrq is high, irq_rxc is set after a delay of Tp units. Furthermore, if neither Reset nor SetRxCIrq is high but INT_SOURCE_Wr[0] and DataIn[6] are both set, irq_rxc will be cleared after a delay of Tp units.
