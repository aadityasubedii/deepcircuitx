Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code defines the logic for an active-low signal, 'MdcEn_n'. The signal gets activated when both 'CountEq0' and 'Mdc' signals are high ('&' represents logical AND). This implementation implies the 'MdcEn_n' signal is a dependent control signal, influenced by the states of both 'CountEq0' and 'Mdc'.
