Comment: 
This block of code functions as a clock-triggered section of a larger hardware design, specific to the VIRTEX6 FAMILY. The function activates upon the positive edge of the clock input (clk_i). It is employed as part of a conditionally compiled generate statement conditional upon the FAMILY constant being equal to "VIRTEX6", thus it will only synthesize for VIRTEX6 FPGA hardware family. It forms a named begin-end block, denoted "pipe_in_v6", which performs some function on positive clk_i clock transitions. Further context is needed to define the specific function performed within this clock-triggered block.
