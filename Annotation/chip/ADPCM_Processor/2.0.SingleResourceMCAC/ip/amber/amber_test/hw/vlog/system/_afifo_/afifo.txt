Module-level comment: The afifo module is an asynchronous FIFO queue that handles the chronological storage and retrieval of data. It uses input (i_data, wr_clk, rd_clk, i_push, i_pop) and output ports (o_data, o_full, o_empty). Functionality is achieved through write and read pointers, delayed and gray versions of the pointers for safe asynchronous operation, and data array for data storage. Operations include push (write) and pop (read) processes under control of wr_clk and rd_clk signals, while full or empty conditions are indicated by o_full and o_empty signals. Gray code conversion ensures error-free pointer value changes.
