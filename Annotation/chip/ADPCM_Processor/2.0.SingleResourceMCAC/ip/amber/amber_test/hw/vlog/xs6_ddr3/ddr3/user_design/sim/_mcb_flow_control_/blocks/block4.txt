Comment: 
The given block of Verilog code controls read command pending status based on certain triggering conditions. The functionality of the block is made possible by implementing a flip-flop that triggers at the positive edge of an input clock (`clk_i`). If push command (`push_cmd`) and read command (`cmd_rd`) are both active. The reading command pending (`cmd_rd_pending_r1`) is set to true after a delay of `TCQ` time units. If the transfer command (`xfer_cmd`) is active, `cmd_rd_pending_r1` is set to false again after `TCQ` time units. The operation depends on three signals: `cmd_rd`, `push_cmd`, and `xfer_cmd`.
