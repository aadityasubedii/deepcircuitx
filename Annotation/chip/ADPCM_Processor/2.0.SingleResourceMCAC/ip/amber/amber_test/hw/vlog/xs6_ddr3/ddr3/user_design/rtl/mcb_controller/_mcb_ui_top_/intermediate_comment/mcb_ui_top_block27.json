    "block_comment": "This function reconfigures the arbitration slot (`convert_arb_slot`) by changing the mapping between ports and arbitration slots (`mig_arb_slot`). It does this by making use of user-defined port configuration (`port_config`) and enabled port status (`port_enable`). The port configuration defines the port mapping arrangement that is assigned to the `port_map` variable through a case statement. Then, the function iterates over enabled ports, first counting the number of enabled ports and then associating each enabled port to an arbitration slot according to the provided port configuration and the arbitration slot state. If there are inactive ports, they are set with a default state. The function ensures a flexible management of arbitration slots according to user-defined configurations, with error handling provided for invalid port configurations."
