    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for handling a synchronous operation based on the signals `UI_CLK` and `MCB_UODATAVALID`. Specifically, on the rising edge of either signal, the code within the `always` block executes. If signal `MCB_UODATAVALID` is high (set to '1'), it sets the `MCB_UODATAVALID_U` signal to be '1'. If `MCB_UODATAVALID` is not high, the `MCB_UODATAVALID_U` signal takes the same value as `MCB_UODATAVALID`. This block ensures that `MCB_UODATAVALID_U` tracks the value of `MCB_UODATAVALID` correctly when valid data is available, acting as a signal handler."
