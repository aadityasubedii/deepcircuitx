The block of code is responsible for simulating bus delay in response to the falling edge of the RAS (Row Address Select) signal. Using Verilog's non-blocking assignment, it sets `ras_n_in`'s value to `ras_n` after a delay signified by `#BUS_DELAY`, which accurately mirrors real-world hardware behaviors wherein the bus would not react instantaneously to signal changes.
