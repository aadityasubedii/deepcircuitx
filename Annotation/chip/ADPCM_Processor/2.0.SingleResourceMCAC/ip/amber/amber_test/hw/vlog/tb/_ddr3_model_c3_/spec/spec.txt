Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module represents a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, simulating its timing and functionality. It includes input ports for control signals (rst_n, ck, ck_n, cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank selection (ba, addr), data masking (dm_tdqs), and bidirectional data and strobe signals (dq, dqs, dqs_n). The module features an output port for termination data strobe (tdqs_n) and an input for on-die termination control (odt). Internally, it utilizes numerous signals for timing control, configuration settings, and state management, including clock parameters, latency counters, and mode registers. The code is organized into several functional blocks, including initialization sequences, command decoding,
