    "block_comment": "The block manages the status of data transmission interrupts within an Amber UART system. It operates under different conditions based on the status of two trigger conditions: whether a write command has started and if the requested address matches the Amber UART's Interrupt Control Register (ICR); and if the FIFO functionality is enabled. When a write operation to the ICR is initiated, it suppresses the data transmission interrupt. Otherwise, if FIFO is enabled, it generates an interrupt when FIFO is half or less than half full and `uart_cr_reg[5]` is set. If FIFO is not enabled, it generates an interrupt when FIFO is empty and `uart_cr_reg[5]` is set."
