    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a timing check on the 21st bit of the 'dqs_in' data stream whenever there's a negative edge in its signal. This functionality is implemented by using the 'always' keyword to trigger an event-triggered process, specifically the procedure 'dqs_pos_timing_check' with an argument of '20', whenever there's a falling transition on the 21st bit of 'dqs_in'."
