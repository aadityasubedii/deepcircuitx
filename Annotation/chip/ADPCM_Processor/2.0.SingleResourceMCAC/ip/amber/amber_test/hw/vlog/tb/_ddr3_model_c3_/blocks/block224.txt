This Verilog function, `read_from_file`, reads a specified chunk of data from a file. It takes as input a file descriptor `fd` and an index `index`, and outputs a value of width `RFF_BITS`. The function uses the `fseek` and `fscanf` system tasks to navigate to a determined offset in the file and read a chunk of data, respectively. In cases where these tasks fail, the function outputs error messages and terminates the simulation. There's also a block checking the first bit of the `read_value`, if it's `z` then set it to `0`. However, If it's `0`, then set `read_value` back to `hx` which denotes an unknown or uninitialized value in entire width of `RFF_BITS`.
