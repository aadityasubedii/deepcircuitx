Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is conditional on the value of the parameter `C_MCB_USE_EXTERNAL_BUFPLL`. If this parameter is 0, the block instantiates an MCB buffer PLL (`BUFPLL_MCB`) with specific configuration, taking system clocks as input. The buffer PLL is divided by 2 and locked to `LOCK_TO_0`, which translates to `IOCLK0` and `IOCLK1` outputs. Otherwise, if `C_MCB_USE_EXTERNAL_BUFPLL` is not 0, the block directly assigns system clocks to output clocks and maintains PLL lock status. This design presents a flexible clocking scheme that adapts according to the systemâ€™s buffering mechanism.
