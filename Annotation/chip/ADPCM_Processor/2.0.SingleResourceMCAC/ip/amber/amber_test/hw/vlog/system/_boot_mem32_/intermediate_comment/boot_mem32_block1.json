    "block_comment": "The block of code is used for initiating a boot sequence message display. It uses an `initial` block in Verilog which is typically used for initializing signals or invoking test benches. In this case, it's used to display a message giving information about the boot memory file being used. The `%s` is a placeholder that gets replaced by the value of macro `BOOT_MEM32_PARAMS_FILE`. This macro is defined elsewhere, probably carrying a string that defines the path to the boot memory parameter files. This initial block in Verilog ensures the output message is presented once at the start of the simulation."
