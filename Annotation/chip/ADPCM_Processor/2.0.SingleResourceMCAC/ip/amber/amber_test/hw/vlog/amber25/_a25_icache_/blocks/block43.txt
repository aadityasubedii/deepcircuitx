This block of code is related to a control mechanism for handling read and write requests in a design. When a reset signal is detected, it clears the write-back (wb) address. In the case of write-back requests, it assigns the incoming address to the wb_address. Additionally, this block also has an address increment function which gets triggered when i_wb_ready signal is high and fill_state is true. In this case, it increments the least significant bits of the address and updates the wb_address.
