Comment: 
The given block of code, WAIT_FOR_UODONE, primarily aims to initiate and control the memory controller (MCB) function and provide system reset capabilities. It incorporates a conditional statement to corroborate whether the IODRPCTRLR is ready and MCB_UODONECAL is accessible. When both conditions are satisfied, it activates the memory controller unit command ('MCB_UICMDEN) and calculates the initial delay for the Data Quality Services (DQS) based on predefined values. Following this, the system state alternates to 'LDQS_WRITE_POS_INDELAY'. Conversely, the system persists in the 'WAIT_FOR_UODONE' state when the conditions are unmet, thus offering a loop-control mechanic.
