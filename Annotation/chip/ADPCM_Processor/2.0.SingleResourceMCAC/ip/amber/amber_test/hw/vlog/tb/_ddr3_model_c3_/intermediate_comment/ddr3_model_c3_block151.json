    "block_comment": "This block of code is a procedural construct in Verilog that calls the function `cmd_addr_timing_check(20)` whenever there is a change in state of the 14th bit of the `addr_in` signal. The functionality of the block is to implement a timing check operation on the given command address for every state's change specified by `addr_in[13]`. It achieves this by monitoring the 14th bit of the `addr_in` signal using the sensitivity list mechanism of Verilog (`always @`). With every state change, `cmd_addr_timing_check(20)` function is invoked to perform the timing check operation."
