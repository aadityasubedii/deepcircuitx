    "block_comment": "This block of code performs the function of assigning data to `w1data` based on the conditions of `data_mode_i` and address condition bits from `addr_i[7:4]`. On every positive edge of the clock signal, and when the FIFO is ready or a start command is received, the block looks at the `addr_i[7:4]`, chooses the corresponding `Data_Gen` or `Data_GenW0` instance based on `data_mode_i` which is then assigned to `w1data`. The conditional assignment is implemented using a case statement. If `addr_i[7:4]` does not match any case, `w1data` is set to zero. Furthermore, when `MEM_BURST_LEN` equals 8, `w1data` is loaded with new data boundaries as per defined number of DQ pins (`NUM_DQ_PINS`). It essentially reshuffles the data."
