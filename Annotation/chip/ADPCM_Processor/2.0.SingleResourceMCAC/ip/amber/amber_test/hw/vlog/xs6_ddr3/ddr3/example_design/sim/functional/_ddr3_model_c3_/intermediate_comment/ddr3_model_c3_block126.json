    "block_comment": "This block of code is executing a continuous check of the Digital-to-Digital Quantizer (DQ) input signal array at index position [4]. This is implemented using the procedural 'always' construct, which responds to changes in its sensitivity list, in this case the dq_in[4]. Whenever there's a change in the value of dq_in[4], the 'dq_timing_check' function is called with '4' as its argument to ensure correct timing."
