Comment: 
This block of code specifies a ready or busy state of a hardware component. Depending on the current state of the system, the 'rdy_busy_n' flag is assigned boolean value. Specifically, if the system's state equals 'READY,' the 'rdy_busy_n' value becomes true or 1 (designated by the '==' operator in Verilog); otherwise, 'rdy_busy_n' is false or 0. This block is typically implemented within control flow or state machine design structures in hardware description language (HDL) coding.
