    "block_comment": "This block manages interfacing parameters between a custom port and the memory interface generator block (MIG) of an FPGA, under controlled conditions. If port 0 is enabled (C_PORT_ENABLE[0] == 1'b1), respective port signals are directly mapped to the MIG interface signals, allowing data/command flow. Alternatively, if the port is not enabled, all related control signals are forced to 0, effectively disabling any operations related to port 0."
