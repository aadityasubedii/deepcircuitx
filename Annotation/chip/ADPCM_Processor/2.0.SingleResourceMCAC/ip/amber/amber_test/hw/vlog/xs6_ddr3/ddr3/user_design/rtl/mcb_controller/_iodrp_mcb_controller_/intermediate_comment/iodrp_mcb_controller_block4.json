    "block_comment": "The block of code manages data input for the DRP (Dynamic Reconfiguration Port) in certain conditions. It employs a conditional operation to assign 'DRP_SDI_pre'. When 'DRP_CS' (Chip Select for DRP) is high/true, the first bit of 'shift_through_reg' is chosen as the data input signal; otherwise, it defaults to '0'."
