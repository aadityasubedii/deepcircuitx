This block of code controls the multiplexer (CtrlMux) in a transmission unit, asynchronously resettable by TxReset signal. On every positive clock edge of MTxClk or positive edge of TxReset signal, it determines the state of an output named CtrlMux. If TxReset is high, it resets CtrlMux to 0. If Control data is ready for transmission (WillSendControlFrame is high) and Data Output is not being used (TxUsedDataOut is low), CtrlMux is set to 1. If a transmission is completed (TxDoneIn is high), CtrlMux is reset to 0.
