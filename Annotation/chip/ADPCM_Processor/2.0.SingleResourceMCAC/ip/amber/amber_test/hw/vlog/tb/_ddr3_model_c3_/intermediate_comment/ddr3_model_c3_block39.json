    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for initiating a timing check whenever there is a negative edge on the 27th bit of the dqs_in signal. Specifically, it uses the 'always' keyword to continuously monitor the status of the 27th bit, and calls the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function with the parameter '26' each time it detects a negative edge transition. This block is crucial for ensuring correct timing sequences."
