Comment: 
This block performs a bitwise XOR operation between two sets of data, 'hdata' and 'w1data'. The operation is performed on each bit of the data, with 'i' serving as the iterator running from 0 to DWIDTH - 1, ensuring that every bit is covered. Back-to-back XOR operation changes are responded to immediately due to the 'always @ (w1data,hdata)' directive signifying sensitivity to both 'hdata' and 'w1data'. The result of these operations is stored in the 'ndata' array.
