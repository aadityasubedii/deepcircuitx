    "block_comment": "The block selects and assigns output based on the value of `i_function`. If `i_function` equals `LSL`, `lsl_out` is selected; for `LSR`, `lsr_out` is selected; for `ASR`, `asr_out` is picked; otherwise, `ror_out` is chosen. The selected output, along with `o_carry_out`, forms the output of the block."
