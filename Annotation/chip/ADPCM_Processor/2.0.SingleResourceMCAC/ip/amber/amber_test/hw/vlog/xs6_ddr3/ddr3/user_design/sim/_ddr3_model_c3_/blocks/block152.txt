This block of code enables a timing check on a specific bit of an address input. More specifically, the always construct in this single-line Verilog code is triggering a timing check on the 13th bit (since Verilog is 0-indexed) of the 'addr_in' signal every time it changes. This timing check is accomplished by calling the function 'cmd_addr_timing_check' with argument '19'.
