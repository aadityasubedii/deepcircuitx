    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for data output assignments. It relies on the value of the 'addr_data_sel_n' control signal to select the output between 'memcell_addr_reg' and 'data_reg'. If 'addr_data_sel_n' is true, the output 'data_out' consists of a single bit of 0 concatenated with the 'memcell_addr_reg'. Otherwise, a single bit of 0 is concatenated with the 'data_reg' to form output 'data_out'."
