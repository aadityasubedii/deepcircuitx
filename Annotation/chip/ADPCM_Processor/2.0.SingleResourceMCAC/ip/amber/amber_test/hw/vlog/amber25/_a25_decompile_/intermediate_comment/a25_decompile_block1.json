    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block implements a function 'more_to_come' that checks if there's more data forthcoming from a sequence of 16-bit registers. The function takes a 16-bit register 'regs' and a 32-bit input 'i' as inputs. Accordingly, based on the value of 'i', the function assigns the bit-wise reduction OR of the subset of registers starting from the 15th bit to the ith bit to 'more_to_come'. If the result of the operation is non-zero, 'more_to_come' is set to 1, indicating additional information to process; otherwise, it's set to 0."
