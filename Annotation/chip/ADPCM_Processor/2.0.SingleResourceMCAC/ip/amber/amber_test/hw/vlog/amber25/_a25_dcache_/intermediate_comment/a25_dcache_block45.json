    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to declare a 32-bit wire called `con_write_data_word`. Wires in Verilog are used for both combinatorial and sequential logic, but in this case, without additional context, it's used as an interconnection mechanism between different modules or parts of a design. `con_write_data_word` is a 32-bit (from 31 to 0) wire, which means it can hold a 32-bit binary number or 32-bit data word, which can be written onto this wire."
