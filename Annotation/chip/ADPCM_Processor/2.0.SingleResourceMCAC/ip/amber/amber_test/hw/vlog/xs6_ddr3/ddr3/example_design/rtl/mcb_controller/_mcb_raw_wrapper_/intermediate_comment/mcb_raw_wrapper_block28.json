    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a generate loop that instantiates multiple OSERDES2 modules (one for each memory bank address bit). OSERDES2 is a high-speed serial-to-parallel converter which is used here to serialize memory bank addresses. Each OSERDES2 instance is configured with defined constants (such as data rates and operation modes), and is connected to its respective 'ba_ioi' enable line and 'ioclk0' clock signal. Inputs 'D1' and 'D2' are fed from 'ba_90[ba_ioi]', while other data inputs and training inputs are tied to zeros. Control signals 'IOCE' and 'TCE' are always enabled whereas 'OCE' is tied to 1, allowing constant operation and the module is reset by 'int_sys_rst'. 'OQ', the output signal, is wired to 'ioi_ba[ba_ioi]', and 'TQ' is wired to 't_ba[ba_ioi]'. All SHIFTOUT and SHIFTIN pins are unused in this application."
