This block of Verilog code implements a check for timing violations for CKE signal under defined timing constraints TIH and TIPW. The check is done whenever 'cke_in' changes. If the reset signal 'rst_n_in' is high, it checks for two conditions: the time from a positive edge of the clock to the current time greater than TIH, and the time from the previous clock edge to the current time less than TIPW. If either condition is violated, then an appropriate error is displayed. The 'tm_cke' variable keeps a record of the most recent change in 'cke_in'.
