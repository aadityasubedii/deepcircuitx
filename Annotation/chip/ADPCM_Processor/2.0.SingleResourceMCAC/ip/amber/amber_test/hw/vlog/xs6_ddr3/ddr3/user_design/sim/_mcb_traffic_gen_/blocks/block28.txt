Comment: 
This block of code creates a synchronously reset bunch of flip-flops with reset inputs 'rst_ra' and 'rst_rb'. Upon receiving a positive edge trigger from clock input 'clk_i', it assigns a delay in simulation time units '#TCQ' to the reset arrays 'rst_ra' and 'rst_rb' containing 10 elements of the reset input 'rst_i'.
