Comment: 
The block dynamically selects between two variations of boot memory (boot_mem32 and boot_mem128) modules based on the word bit (WB_DWIDTH) size. If the word bit size is 32, it instantiates the boot_mem32 module, else the boot_mem128 module is instantiated. Both modules take the same inputs and outputs - handling signals related to the wishbone protocol for data transfer, such as clock, reset, address, data in (input), data read (output), acknowledgement, error, and related control signals. The difference between the two modules is not explicitly described within this block, but it is implied that they have different data widths, affecting how the data is handled internally.
