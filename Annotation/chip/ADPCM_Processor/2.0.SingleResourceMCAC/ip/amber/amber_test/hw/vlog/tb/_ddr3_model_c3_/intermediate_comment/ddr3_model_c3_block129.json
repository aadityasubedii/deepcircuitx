    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code serves as a trigger for a timing check on data queue input ```dq_in[1]```. Specifically, it sets a procedural block that gets activated whenever there's a change in the state of ```dq_in[1]```. Upon activation, it calls the ```dq_timing_check(1)``` function to confirm the timing integrity of the data input, which is essential in ensuring overall system performance and stability. The index \"1\" signifies that it is specifically checking the second bit of the data queue input."
