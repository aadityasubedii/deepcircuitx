    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a function that triggers the `dqs_odd_receiver` for the 6th bit of the `dqs_odd` data segment on every rising edge of the clock. It accomplishes this through using an `always` block which watches for a positive edge (`posedge`) on the 6th bit of the `dqs_odd` data segment. Upon observing a rising edge, the `dqs_odd_receiver` function for the 6th bit is invoked."
