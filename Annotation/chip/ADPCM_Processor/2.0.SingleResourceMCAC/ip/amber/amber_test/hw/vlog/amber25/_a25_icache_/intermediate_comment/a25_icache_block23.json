    "block_comment": "The block is conditionally generating read data for a 2-way set associative cache. If the data hit is in the 0-way, it assigns 0-way's data read to 'hit_rdata', else if it's in the 1-way, it assigns 1-way's data read to 'hit_rdata'. If it misses both ways, it defaults 'hit_rdata' to a value of width 'CACHE_LINE_WIDTH' with all bits set to 1."
