This RTL block configures and manages the memory controller block (MCB), its operations, and interfaces. The purpose of MCB is to manage read and write operations to memory blocks. Memory interfacing functionality includes assignments of memory block details like read/write enable, clock, command variables, and interfacing user inputs with the memory controller block. Writes are handled with pixel data divided into 4 blocks for parallel writing. Write operations are facilitated with signals for data, enable, and mask. Similar operations are performed for read operations with data distributed into 4 blocks. It also deals with interface mode-based assignments. Commands for read/write operations are managed with values like empty, full, overflow etc. Furthermore, it includes the definition of parameters for the Memory Controller Block instance.
