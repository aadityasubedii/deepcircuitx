    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'generic_sram_byte_en' module manages a byte-enabled generic SRAM memory. It takes data, write enable, address, and byte enable inputs to write data to a specific memory address blocked synchronously with the clock signal. Internal registers 'mem', 'i', and 'j' ensure memory storage and management during write operations or initialization. It also supports test mode and scan functionalities for testing purposes, and a reset feature to initialize memory. Write operations are executed only if enabled, and read operations are performed otherwise."
