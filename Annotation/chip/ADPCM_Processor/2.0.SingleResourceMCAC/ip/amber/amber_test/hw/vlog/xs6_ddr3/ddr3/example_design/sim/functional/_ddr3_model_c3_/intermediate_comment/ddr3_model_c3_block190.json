    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for generating a call to the function \"dqs_odd_receiver\" on the positive edge of the second element \"dqs_odd\" array. The \"always @ (posedge...)\" construct in Verilog is used to specify that the subsequent block of code should be executed whenever there is a change from '0' to '1' (positive edge) on the second bit of \"dqs_odd\". In this context, dqs_odd represents a digital signal that becomes active when its value rises from a low voltage level (0) to a high voltage level (1)."
