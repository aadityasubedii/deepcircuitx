    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a flip-flop circuit that captures and holds the value of the input run_traffic_i upon the rising edge of the clock signal (clk_i). The value is held within the run_traffic_reg register and has a propagation delay specified by the constant #TCQ. The implementation is carried out via an always block sensitive to the positive edge transitions of clk_i, providing synchronization of the run_traffic_i input to the clocking signal."
