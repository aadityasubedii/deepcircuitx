    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles transmission retry packet blocking logic. Upon a positive edge of either the Write Back Clock (WB_CLK_I) or Reset signals, it checks several conditions: If the Reset signal is active, it forces 'TxRetryPacketBlocked' to 0 with a propagation delay denoted by 'Tp'. Alternatively, if there is no retry but a previous retry attempt was made, it also forces 'TxRetryPacketBlocked' to 0. If a retry packet is being transmitted ('TxRetryPacket' = 1), it sets 'TxRetryPacketBlocked' to 1, again with a propagation delay specified by 'Tp'. Therefore, it helps in controlling the flow of retry packet transmission."
