Comment: 
The given block of Verilog code is responsible for monitoring changes to the 38th bit of the 'dq_in' input array and triggering function 'dq_timing_check(37)' whenever a change is noticed. It uses an 'always' block to latch onto the specified signal (dq_in[37]) and trigger the function, which most likely performs some sort of timing check, every time this specific signal changes. The block thus implements a monitoring and check mechanism for the certain bit of input signal.
