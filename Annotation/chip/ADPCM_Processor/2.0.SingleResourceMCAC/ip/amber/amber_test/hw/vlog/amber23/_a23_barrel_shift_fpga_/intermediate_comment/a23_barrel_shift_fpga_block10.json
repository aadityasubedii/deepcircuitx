    "block_comment": "This line of code is an assignment operation for a 32-bit variable 'p_r'. It concatenates a 31-bit portion of the variable 'rot_prod' with the 32nd bit of 'rot_prod'. Specifically, this operation takes the lower 31 bits from 'rot_prod' and appends it at the beginnings with the MSB (most significant bit) from 'rot_prod'. The assigned value then forms a 32-bit value for 'p_r'. This operation can be viewed as a circular right shift of one position on a 32-bit 'rot_prod'."
