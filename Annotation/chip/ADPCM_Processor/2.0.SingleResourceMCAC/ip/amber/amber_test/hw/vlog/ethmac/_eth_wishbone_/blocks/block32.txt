Comment: 
This Verilog code block is a synchronizer for the 'ShiftEnded_rck' signal. It synchronizes the 'ShiftEnded_rck' signal with the Wishbone clock ('WB_CLK_I') or system reset signal ('Reset'). At the rising edge of the Wishbone clock or system reset, if a system reset is triggered, the synchronizer output ('ShiftEndedSync1') is set to logic low. Otherwise, the output is equal to the state of 'ShiftEnded_rck' signal. The delay '#Tp' might be used to model the propagation delay.
