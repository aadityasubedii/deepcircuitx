    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a flip-flop, which captures and holds the state of the 'ck_in' input signal at the rising edge of the same 'ck_in' signal. This is achieved through the use of the 'always' procedural block triggered at the positive edge of 'ck_in'. The current state of 'ck_in' is diverted to 'diff_ck' whenever a positive edge (transition from low to high) is detected in 'ck_in'."
