    "block_comment": "The instantiation of an `mcb_raw_wrapper_inst` module handles a Memory Controller Block (MCB) with multiple ports. Each port controls commands, read and write operations to and from memory. It also contains interfaces for DRAM signals and calibration control. Each port can perform reads, writes and commands independently, enabling simultaneous memory operations. Inputs like `cmd_en` and `wr_en` control command and write enable states per port, while `cmd_instr` and `wr_data` feed instructions and data to these ports. The status of data buffers is communicated through flags like `cmd_full`, `wr_empty`. DRAM signals control memory transactions at the hardware level, while calibration interfaces assist in system-level tuning of the memory interface."
