    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value at the 0th index of the shift_through_reg signal to the DRP_SDI. The assignment uses the non-blocking assignment operator, which means that it doesn't block the execution of other tasks while this action is performed. The purpose of this block is to pass the initial bit of the shift_through_reg vector to the DRP_SDI wire. This is usually performed to ensure a continuous flow of the data from the register to the specific input port without blocking the other operations."
