    "block_comment": "This block generates a 64-bit wide data output depending on the input conditions. It is triggered by changes in `adata`, `hdata`, `ndata`, `w1data`, `prbs_data`, `data_mode_i`, or `fixed_data_i`. The block's behavior is controlled by the `DWIDTH` parameter which, when set to 64, activates the data_out64 output. The block makes use of the generate and if construct, allowing the dynamic activation of the given output based on the input variables."
