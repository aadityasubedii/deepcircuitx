Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for managing the Lower Significant Bit (LSB) of the transmit pointer in a system. It operates through a series of conditional statements that get triggered on the positive edge of the WB_CLK_I signal or a system reset. If a reset event occurs, it sets the two LSBs of the TxPointerLSB_rst to zero. When both TxEn and TxPointerRead high while a transmit is ongoing, it assigns the output of the RAM (ram_do) to the two LSBs of the TxPointerLSB_rst. Lastly, if MasterWbTX is enabled and the m_wb_ack_i gives an acknowledgement, it also sets the LSBs of the TxPointerLSB_rst to zero.
