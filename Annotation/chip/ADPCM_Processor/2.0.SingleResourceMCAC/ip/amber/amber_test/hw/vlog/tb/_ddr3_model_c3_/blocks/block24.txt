This block of code initiates a timing check whenever there is a negative edge detected in the 9th bit of the 'dqs_in' input array. It achieves this by using an 'always' block that is sensitive to negative transitions in 'dqs_in[8]', invoking the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function with the argument 8 on each occurrence.
