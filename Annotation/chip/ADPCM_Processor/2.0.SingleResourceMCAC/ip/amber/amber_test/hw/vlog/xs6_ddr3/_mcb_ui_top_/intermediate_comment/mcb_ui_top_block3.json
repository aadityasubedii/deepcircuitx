    "block_comment": "This block assigns a set of inputs and outputs for command processing and write operations in a system module. These assignments involve enabling arbitration, command processing, and write operations. It also assigns the clock signals, command instructions, byte address for commands, write masks, and write data. In addition, it handles the status of command and write buffers by assigning their respective full and empty flags, count of write operations, and error conditions such as underrun and general errors."
