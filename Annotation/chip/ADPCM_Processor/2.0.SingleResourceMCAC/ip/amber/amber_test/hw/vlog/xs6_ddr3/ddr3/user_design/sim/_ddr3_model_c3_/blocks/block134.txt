This block of code is designed to manage a dynamic monitor check for a specific data-stream; specifically, it is used for checking data timing on the 14th bit of the data-stream referred by dm_in. Whenever there's a change on the 14th bit (a.k.a., dm_in[13]) of the data stream, the function "dm_timing_check()" is called with the argument 13, triggering a timing check on this specific bit. This is done by utilizing the "always @" construct, which initializes the timing check routine every time a specified event (i.e., a change at dm_in[13]) takes place.
