    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for initiating a timing check on the command address whenever there's a change at the 14th bit of the input address (`addr_in[13]`). It utilizes the `cmd_addr_timing_check` function, passing `20` as the parameter, to validate if the timing conditions are met, ensuring correct command address synchronization."
