    "block_comment": "This block of code serves to initialize and update a Linear Feedback Shift Register(LFSR) for pseudo-random number generation. On a positive edge of the input clock, if 'prbs_seed_init' and 'EYE_TEST' are set as specified or a reset signal is received, the register 'lfsr_q' is initialized by adding the input 'prbs_seed_i' with first 32 bits of 'prbs_fseed_i' and the hexadecimal number '55555555'. If clock is enabled ('clk_en' == 1) and none of the aforementioned conditions is met, the register 'lfsr_q' is updated using bit manipulation and exclusive OR operations for the next clock cycle."
