Comment: 
This block of code is a digital circuit that captures and registers input signals with respect to a positive edge of a clock signal. Upon every positive edge of the 'clk_i' clock input, the code implements a delay defined by 'TCQ'. `data_rdy_i` signal is captured and registered into its subsequent flip-flop, `data_rdy_r1` while `data_rdy_r1` is also further clocked into `data_rdy_r2`. Similarly, the `cmd_valid_i` is captured and registered into `cmd_valid_r1`.
