    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a data selector and formatter for 32-bit and 128-bit Wishbone (WB) data widths. If the WB data width (WB_DWIDTH) is 128-bit, 'wb_wdata32' selects one of four 32-bit segments from 'i_wb_dat' based on the 'i_wb_adr'[3:2] address value. The selected segment is then duplicated four times in 'o_wb_dat'. If WB_DWIDTH is not 128-bit (presumably 32-bit), 'wb_wdata32' simply assigns the value of 'i_wb_dat' and 'o_wb_dat' receives the value of 'wb_rdata32'. This code block thereby allows handling of both 32-bit and 128-bit data widths for WB data."
