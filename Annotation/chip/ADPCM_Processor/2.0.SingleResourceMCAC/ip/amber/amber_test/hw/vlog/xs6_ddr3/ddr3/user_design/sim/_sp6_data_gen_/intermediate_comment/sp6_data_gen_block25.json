    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to select one of multiple data inputs depending on the selection signal, `data_mode_i`. The selection is determined by a case statement depending on the 4-bit value of `data_mode_i`, each correlating to a different data signal. A default is provided to default the data to `0'b0` when none of the case condition is matched."
