This block of code defines a condition for when the variable `WAYS` equals to `3`. It employs a built-in function `pick_way` to select the `next_way` from valid ones. The `pick_way` function operates by evaluating the provided `valid_bits_r` and `random_num` to produce a new `next_way` for future operations.
