This block generates a specific data pattern for a data width of 32, based on the instruction given. The implementation uses a generate construct in combination with an if-statement to produce a 'Hammer' data pattern or typical data pattern if the DATA_PATTERN is set to "DGEN_HAMMER" or "DGEN_ALL" respectively. The actual data pattern generation happens synchronously on the rising edge of the input clock 'clk_i'.
