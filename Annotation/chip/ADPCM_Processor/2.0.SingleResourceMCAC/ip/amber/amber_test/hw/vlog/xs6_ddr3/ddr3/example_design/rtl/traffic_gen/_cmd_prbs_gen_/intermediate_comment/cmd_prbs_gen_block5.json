    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code generates a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) based on a condition for a SPARTAN6 family or other families. If the device belongs to the SPARTAN6 family, the for-loop generates 'prbs' sequence based on 'PRBS_SADDR', 'PRBS_EADDR', and 'lfsr_q' for different bit positions determined by 'PRBS_SADDR_MASK_POS' and 'PRBS_EADDR_MASK_POS'. It initializes the lower bits of 'prbs' with zeros. The PRBS generation process is similar for other device families but with different loop start and end indices with 'logb2(DWIDTH) - 4' and a different initialization of lower bits."
