    "block_comment": "This block of code configures and deploys input/output buffer and DDR output register programming for an integrated circuit. If the memory type is DDR, DDR2, or DDR3, and the in-terminal calibration option is not skipped, an I/O Buffer (IOBUF) and a Double Data Rate Output Register Programming (IODRP2) block are initiated. The IOBUF module determines the I/O behavior of the programmable IC pin ZIO_Pin using the control signal ZIO_TOUT. The IODRP2 block further manipulates the data flow using various control and data signals, including memory interface clock(UI_CLK), data output(DOUT), input data(IDATAIN), etc., to achieve the precise timing control required in DDR operations."
