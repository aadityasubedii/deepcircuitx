    "block_comment": "This block of code is devoted to toggle the enable signal (\"refresh_cmd_en\") for the refresh command based on certain conditions. At the rising edge of the clock, if the fifth bit of the reset input signal is set, it deactivates the \"refresh_cmd_en\" after a delay defined by \"TCQ\". However, if the counter \"refresh_timer\" hits a value of 1023, the block activates the \"refresh_cmd_en\". Lastly, if both 'cmd_clk_en' and 'refresh_cmd_en' are active simultaneously, it deems the refresh command complete, hence resets 'refresh_cmd_en' after a delay defined by \"TCQ\". The enable signal \"refresh_cmd_en\" controls the execution of memory-refresh operations to prevent data loss."
