    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for the soft calibration of the Memory Controller Block (MCB). It uses the module \"mcb_soft_calibration_top\" which is parameterized and instantiated with certain defined inputs. The calibration process is initiated under the condition C_CALIB_SOFT_IP which when TRUE, allocates necessary resources to manage memory requests and ensure they run correctly. The module receives inputs including various timing/calibration controls, and outputs like calibration status. Furthermore, it interacts with the memory through signals like UI commands, data interface and refresh flags to coordinate calibration.\"\n"
