Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for pushing data into the receive (RX) FIFO buffer. The data is pushed into the FIFO when the receiving state machine is in the STOP state (rxd_state == RXD_STOP) and the count of receive bit pulses are zero (rx_bit_pulse_count == 10'd0), indicating the completion of a data reception cycle.
