    "block_comment": "This block manages bit counter increments during ADDR_PHASE and DATA_PHASE, when synchronous reset signal is not active, in a clocked behavior. Execution takes place at the rising edge of the DRP_CLK signal. Specifically, bit_cnt is incremented by 1 during ADDR_PHASE or DATA_PHASE if synchronous reset is off. If none of those conditions are met, then bit_cnt is reset to zero."
