This block manages data writing to the w1data register, conditionally triggered by a clock signal, fifo_rdy_i or cmd_startC flags. The writing operation considers the data mode and addr_i[3] or the length of the memory burst. For specific data modes and address, it gets data from either Data_Gen or Data_GenW0 procedures. For an 8-bit memory burst, it combines bits of w1data to a new format.
