This block's function is a part of a cache behavior handling a specific condition, wherein it checks for a cache hit scenario when the cache is designed to be 4-way associative. The 'check_hit_4ways' label provides a scope for the logic under this conditional statement. The detailed implementation of how the check is performed is not visible here, that would inside this named begin-end block. The implementation strictly depends upon the internal algorithms and organization of the cache.
