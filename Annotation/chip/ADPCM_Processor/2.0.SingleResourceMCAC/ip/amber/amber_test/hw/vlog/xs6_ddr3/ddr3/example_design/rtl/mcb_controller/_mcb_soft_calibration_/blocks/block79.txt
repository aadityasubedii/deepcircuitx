Comment: 
This block of code creates a temporary reset signal 'rst_tmp'. The reset is assigned true when two conditions are satisfied: when the PLL clock is not locked ('~PLL_LOCK_R2') and when the system is not in self-refresh mode ('~SELFREFRESH_MODE'). If either of these statuses is true, 'rst_tmp' will be assigned false. This implies that the block is used to control the reset status of an FPGA design. The logic behind is that reset must only be activated when the PLL clock is stable, and the system is not in a power-saving, self-refresh mode.
