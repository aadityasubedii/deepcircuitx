Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is primarily used for handling interrupt requests in a system. It specifically assigns values for four different types of requests: Fast Interrupt Request (FIRQ), Interrupt Request (IRQ), Software Interrupt (SWI), and Data Abort (DABT) based on system states. FIRQ and IRQ requests are only signaled if the respective interrupt (firq, irq) occured and if execution status bit at respective positions (26 for firq and 27 for irq) are not set. In contrast, SWI is requested when a specific type equals to SWI. The DABT request is directly tied with the dabt_reg the register content that indicates data abort condition.
