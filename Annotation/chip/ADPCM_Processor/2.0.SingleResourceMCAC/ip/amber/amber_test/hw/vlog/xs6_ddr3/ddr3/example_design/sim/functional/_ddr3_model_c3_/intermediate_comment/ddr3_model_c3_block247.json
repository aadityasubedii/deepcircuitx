    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for applying a delay to the reset signal in a sequential circuit. This is achieved by using the non-blocking assignment (`<=`) along with the delay control `#BUS_DELAY` to the `rst_n_in` signal. Based on the given stimulus (`rst_n`), the `rst_n_in` output signal will be delayed accordingly. This is typically used in modelling scenarios where changes in the state or output should not be immediate."
