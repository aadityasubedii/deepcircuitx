Comment: 
This Verilog code block defines two parallel processes for monitoring the status of calibration in a system. The first process, labeled 'calibration_done', waits for the 'calib_done' signal to be asserted, upon which it displays a "Calibration Done" message. It then waits for a specific period before checking for data errors. If no errors are found, a "TEST PASSED" message is displayed; otherwise, a "TEST FAILED: DATA ERROR" message is displayed, and the 'calib_not_done' process is terminated. The second process, 'calib_not_done', waits for a longer period before checking if the 'calib_done' signal has not been asserted. If it has not, a "TEST FAILED: INITIALIZATION DID NOT COMPLETE" message is displayed and the 'calibration_done' process is terminated. Both processes end by calling the '$finish' function, ending the simulation.
