This block of Verilog RTL code serves as error detection for the Wishbone cycles (s1 and s2). If an error occurs during either cycle, it stops the system and displays an error message along with key error information. Upon the positive edge of the wb_clk_i signal, it checks if an error signal (s1_wb_err_i or s2_wb_err_i) is high and if the corresponding cycle (s1_wb_cyc_o or s2_wb_cyc_o) is active. If both conditions are satisfied for either cycle, it displays the current simulation time, the output data, address, selector, and write enable signals' values, and then stops the simulation.
