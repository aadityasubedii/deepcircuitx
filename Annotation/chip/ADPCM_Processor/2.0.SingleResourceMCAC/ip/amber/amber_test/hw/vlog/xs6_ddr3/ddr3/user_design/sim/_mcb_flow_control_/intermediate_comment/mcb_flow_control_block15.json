    "block_comment": "The block of code is an assignment operation that assigns the input signal 'bl_i' to the output 'rd_bl_o'. As it's a continuous assignment statement, any change in 'bl_i' instantly reflects on 'rd_bl_o'. Assign statement constitutes the data flow model of Verilog and can be understood as a direct wiring of the left and right side. Hence whenever 'bl_i' updates, 'rd_bl_o' will always hold the updated value."
