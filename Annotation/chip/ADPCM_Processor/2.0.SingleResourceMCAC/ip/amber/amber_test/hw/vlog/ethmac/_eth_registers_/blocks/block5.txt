This block is responsible for updating the 'irq_busy' signal based on varying conditions. On every positive edge of either 'Clk' or 'Reset', certain checks are performed. When a reset signal is detected, it sets 'irq_busy' to false (0). During a 'Busy_IRQ' condition, the block waits for a propagation delay ('Tp') and then sets 'irq_busy' to true (1). Lastly, if the first bit of 'INT_SOURCE_Wr' and the fifth bit of 'DataIn' are both true, 'irq_busy' again waits for 'Tp' time and is set to false.
