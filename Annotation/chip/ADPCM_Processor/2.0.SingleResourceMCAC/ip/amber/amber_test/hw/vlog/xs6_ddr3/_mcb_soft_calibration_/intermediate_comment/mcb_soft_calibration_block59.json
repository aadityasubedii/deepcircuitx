    "block_comment": "The provided code block performs the function of configuring different modes for the input/output data rate processor (IODRP) based on the value of 'Active_IODRP'. The implementation uses a case statement in an always block to handle different modes specified by 'Active_IODRP'. If the mode is 'RZQ', it sets the 'RZQ_IODRP_CS' to 'IODRP_CS' and 'ZIO_IODRP_CS' to 0, while selecting 'RZQ_IODRP_SDO' for 'IODRP_SDO'. Similarly, in 'ZIO' mode, it sets the 'ZIO_IODRP_CS' to 'IODRP_CS', 'RZQ_IODRP_CS' to 0, and picks 'ZIO_IODRP_SDO' for 'IODRP_SDO'. For 'MCB_PORT', and the default case, it sets 'RZQ_IODRP_CS', 'ZIO_IODRP_CS', and 'IODRP_SDO' to 0."
