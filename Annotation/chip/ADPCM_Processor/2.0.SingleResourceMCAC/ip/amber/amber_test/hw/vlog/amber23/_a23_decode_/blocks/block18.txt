Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for making an unconditional request, assigned the name 'und_request'. This occurs when the 'itype' matches the codes 'CODTRANS', 'COREGOP' or when the 'itype' equals 'CORTRANS' and the instruction bits from 11 down to 8 do not equal to decimal 15 ('4'd15'). The 'assign' statement ensures continuous assignment, hence 'und_request' gets updated as soon as the right-hand side expression changes value.
