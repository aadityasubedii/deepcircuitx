    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code is primarily responsible for generating the reset signal of a down counter, denoted by `dcount_rst`. The reset signal for the counter is determined by a logical OR operation between the signals `counts_rst` and `rst_ra[0]`. If either of these signals is high, the `dcount_rst` is set to high, thus resetting the down counter."
