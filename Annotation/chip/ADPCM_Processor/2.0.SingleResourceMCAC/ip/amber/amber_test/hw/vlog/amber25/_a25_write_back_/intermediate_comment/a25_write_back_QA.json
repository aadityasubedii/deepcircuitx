This is done only when the memory stall signal is not active. The module also captures data address independent of other outputs, but still only if memory stall signal is not active. Thus, it essentially serves the purpose of providing read data and related control signals, and the data address from the memory to external interfaces in a synchronized manner following the control signals."
