    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is used to call the 'dq_timing_check' function when there's any change in the 19th bit of the 'dq_in' input signal. Specifically, the `always` keyword indicates that this block should continuously monitor the signal 'dq_in[18]', and once any change (either low to high or high to low) is detected in the signal, it will trigger the 'dq_timing_check' function with '18' as its argument."
