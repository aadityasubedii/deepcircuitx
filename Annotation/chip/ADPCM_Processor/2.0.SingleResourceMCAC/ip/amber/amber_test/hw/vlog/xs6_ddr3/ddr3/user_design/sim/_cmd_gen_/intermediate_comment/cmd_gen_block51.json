    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for enabling the command clock (`cmd_clk_en`). The command clock is enabled when either of the following conditions is met: 1) when `rdy_i`, `pipe_out_vld`, and `run_traffic_i` flags are all set (high); and 2) during a mode loading pulse (`mode_load_pulse` is high) and when the `CMD_PATTERN` matches a specific string \"CGEN_BRAM\". The logical AND (`&`) and OR (`||`) operators are used to determine these conditions within the RTL structure. The system is essentially waiting for the specified parameters to be satisfied before initiating the command clock."
