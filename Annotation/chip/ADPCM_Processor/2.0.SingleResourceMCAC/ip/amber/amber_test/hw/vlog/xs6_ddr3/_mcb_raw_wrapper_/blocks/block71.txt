The block configures a read-interface for the 5th port based on specified configurations. If the port is enabled, it associates the MIcrosoft Interface Generator (MIG) signals with their corresponding port 5 read signals, otherwise, it de-asserts these signals. The write-interface for the same port is always kept unasserted irrespective of the enable status of the port.
