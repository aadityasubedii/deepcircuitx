    "block_comment": "This block inspects instruction codes and manipulates them for micro-translation. Instructions of variable lengths are observed, with each possible case from 1 to 16 bit length represented. The micro-translation-modified instruction is then output as 'mtrans_instruction_nxt', which is a concatenation of the original 31:16 bits from 'instruction', specific bits from 15 to as far as specified by the case, and a number of '0's matching the case. In the default case, if none of the bit patterns match, the output is composed of the original 31:16 bits and 16 '0's."
