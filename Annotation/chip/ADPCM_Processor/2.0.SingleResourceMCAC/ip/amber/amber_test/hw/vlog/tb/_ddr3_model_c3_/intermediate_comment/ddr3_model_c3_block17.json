    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog RTL implements a check for a negative edge on the 16th bit of the 'dqs_in' signal. It does this by invoking the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' with 15 as argument every time the specific condition occurs, i.e., a negative (falling) edge is detected in the 16th bit of 'dqs_in'."
