    "block_comment": "This block controls the configuration of a memory cell for positive edge input delay in the write mode. It specifies the memory cell address, operating mode, and data to be written using PosEdgeInDly, WRITE_MODE, and DQS_DELAY_INITIAL, respectively. The command is forwarded to the Command MUX block via IOI_LDQS_CLK, and a command validity signal is set high. Based on the readiness or busyness of the Memory Controller Block (MCB), the state is either held constant in the current state or transitioned to a waiting state."
