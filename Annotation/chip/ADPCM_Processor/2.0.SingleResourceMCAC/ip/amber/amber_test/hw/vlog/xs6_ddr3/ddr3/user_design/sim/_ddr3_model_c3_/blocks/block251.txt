This block initializes the cmd_addr_string array with string representations corresponding to command lines and different addresses in a processing sequence. The implementation is in an `initial` block, assigning fixed, pre-defined strings representing specific memory-related commands and address lines in a sequence, to corresponding indexes of the `cmd_addr_string` array.
