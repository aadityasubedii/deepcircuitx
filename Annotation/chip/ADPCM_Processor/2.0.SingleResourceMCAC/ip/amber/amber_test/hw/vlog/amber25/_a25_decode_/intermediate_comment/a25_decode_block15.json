    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for controlling the states of multiplication operations in a processor. When the control state is 'MULT_PROC2', certain signals are set including 'pc_wen_nxt', 'iaddress_sel_nxt', and 'multiply_function_nxt' with predefined values or the output from the multiplication function. Meanwhile, when the control state is 'MULT_STORE', it selects the register to write to and updates the 'multiply_function_nxt'. Depending on the type of operation which is either 'MULT' or otherwise, it manipulates the write enable signal for the register bank, 'reg_bank_wen_nxt', based on decoding targeted instruction bits. Also, if the 21st bit of the instruction is set, it updates the status bit selectors and its write-enable signal, contributing to the management of process statuses."
