This block of code modifies the DQS (Data Strobe) delay setting in write mode for positive edge delay. The block assigns the `PosEdgeInDly` address to `IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR`, sets `IODRPCTRLR_R_WB` to write mode, and initializes the delay data to `DQS_DELAY_INITIAL`. Subsequently, it directs this configuration to the `IOI_LDQS_CLK` address in the memory control block (MCB) and puts the MCB command into a valid state. A conditional statement checks the `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` status. If it's ready (1), it maintains the current state `LDQS_WRITE_POS_INDELAY`, if not, it transitions the state to `LDQS_WAIT1`.
