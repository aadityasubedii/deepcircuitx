This block of code focuses on executing read operations from a specific memory cell defined by `MaxValue`. It initializes the command's validity, memory cell address, and read/write mode. The control then waits for the module to not be busy and it enters a wait state until the read data is ready. At this point, the maximum value is updated with the read data. Furthermore, if it's the first time the operations are executed, the system resets the delay and moves on to analyze the maximum value; otherwise, it proceeds directly to analyze the maximum value.
