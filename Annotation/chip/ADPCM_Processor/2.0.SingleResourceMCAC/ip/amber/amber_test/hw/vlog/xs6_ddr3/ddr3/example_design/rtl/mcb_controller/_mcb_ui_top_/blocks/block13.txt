The block primarily checks for the status of the S4 AXI interface, if disabled it simply assigns values of local variables to the corresponding input signal, and if enabled it masks the AXI address with defined ADDR_MASK and also creates and wires two modules: mcb_ui_top_synch and axi_mcb. mcb_ui_top_synch is responsible for synchronizing the system clock with the done signal. The axi_mcb module connects the AXI interface to the Memory Controller Block (MCB). The functionality and readiness of reading and writing operations are being checked through constructs like _valid_, _ready_, _full_, _empty_ etc present in the code.
