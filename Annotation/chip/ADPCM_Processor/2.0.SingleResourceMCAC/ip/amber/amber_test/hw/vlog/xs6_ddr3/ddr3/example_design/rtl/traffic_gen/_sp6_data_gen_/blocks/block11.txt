This block primarily handles data write operations as per a control input. When a positive edge clock signal is received, several operations are potentially triggered. A provided reset input clears w1data asynchronously. Else, a conditional check decides data write operations. If the FIFO is ready and user burst count is non-zero or if a command start flag is defined, the data handling process begins. The number of Data Query (DQ) pins helps decide the action required: for 16 pins, the data writes work on different sections of the addr_i bus (based on addr_i[4]), the value of data_mode_i, and w1data is updated accordingly. For 8 DQ pins, data_mode_i determines the new w1data value. If any other number of DQ pins is used, specific hexadecimal values are directly written to w1data based on data_mode_i.
