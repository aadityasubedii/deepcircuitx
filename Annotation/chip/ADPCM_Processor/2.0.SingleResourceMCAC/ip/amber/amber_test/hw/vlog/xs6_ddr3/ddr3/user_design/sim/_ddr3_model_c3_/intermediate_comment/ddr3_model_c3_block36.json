    "block_comment": "This block of code is a negative edge-triggered procedure block. The procedure is activated every time a falling edge (negative edge) occurs on the 30th bit of the dqs_in signal. It then calls the dqs_pos_timing_check function with parameter 29, passing the value to the function which presumably performs a certain operation based on this triggered condition. The operation details, however, would entirely depend on the specific implementation of the dqs_pos_timing_check function."
