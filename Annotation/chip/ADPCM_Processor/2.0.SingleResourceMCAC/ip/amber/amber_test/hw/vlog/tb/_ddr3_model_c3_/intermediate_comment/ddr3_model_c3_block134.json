    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for invoking the 'dm_timing_check' function when any changes are detected in the 14th bit of the 'dm_in' input data. Implemented using the 'always' control flow statement in Verilog, the hardware design properties enforced by it keeps track of the 14th bit in 'dm_in' vector. Whenever a change (either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) triggers in this bit, the associated function 'dm_timing_check' with 13 as an argument is called, thus enforcing a check or test related to data management timing."
