    "block_comment": "This block of code is intended for generating output buffer instances for each memory address bit in a memory controller or a similar module. These instances created by this loop enable the possibility of tri-stating each individual bit of the address bus 'ioi_addr'. This 'generate' loop iteratively assigns each bit from the 'ioi_addr' register to an 'OBUFT' (output buffer) instance. Each 'OBUFT' instance takes as input an address bit and a test bit ('t_addr') and outputs onto the 'mcbx_dram_addr' bus."
