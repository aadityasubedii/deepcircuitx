    "block_comment": "This block configures the memory interface for reading and writing operations, based on the port configuration and enable flags. If the configuration is set to \"B32\" and \"W32\", and if the port is enabled, the block configures read/write data, error, full and empty signals, the clock, and underflow flag for the memory interface. These signals are tied to corresponding signals on Port 2. In case the port is not enabled, all these signals are set to low. Independently of the conditionals above, read operations signals for Port 2 are always set to low."
