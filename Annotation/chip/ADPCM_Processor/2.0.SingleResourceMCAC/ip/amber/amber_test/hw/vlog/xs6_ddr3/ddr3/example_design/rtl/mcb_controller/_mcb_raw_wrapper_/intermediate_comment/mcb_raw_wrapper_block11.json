    "block_comment": "This block of code defines an output buffer 'OBUFT' for controlling address lines in Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) systems. This Verilog module is named 'iob_cas', interfacing with three wires: '.O(mcbx_dram_cas_n)', an active low signal controlling external DRAM column-address-strobe; '.I(ioi_cas)', a standard input from internal logic to this output buffer driving CAS-n (Column Address Strobe); and '.T(t_cas)', controlling the output enable signal for the buffer. Using this output buffer, interfacing between internal logic and the external DRAM column address strobe line is enabled, effectively controlling memory-accessing operations."
