Comment: 
This block of code forms the basis of a resettable and clock-driven counter in Verilog. Upon receiving a reset signal (`rst_i`), it sets the `rd_data_received_counts` register to zero. Else, if a valid data signal is detected (`data_valid_i`), it increments `rd_data_received_counts` by one on every rising edge of the clock signal (`clk_i`). The propagation delay (`#TCQ`) is applied to simulate realistic hardware conditions.
