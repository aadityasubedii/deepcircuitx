    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for triggering a negative timing check function based on the rising edge condition of the dqs_in signal at the 20th index. It listens for positive edge changes (transition from 0 to 1) in the \"dqs_in[20]\" signal and upon that triggering event, it calls the function \"dqs_neg_timing_check\" with the argument 20. The call to this function is synchronized with the positive edge of the \"dqs_in[20]\" signal."
