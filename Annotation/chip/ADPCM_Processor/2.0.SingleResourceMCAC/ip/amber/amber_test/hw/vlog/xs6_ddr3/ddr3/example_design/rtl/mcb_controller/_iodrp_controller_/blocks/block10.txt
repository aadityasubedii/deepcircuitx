This Verilog RTL block performs a status check for the readiness of a system or module. Specifically, it assigns the signal 'rdy_busy_n' as an active-high indication of readiness, an assertion that occurs only when the system's state machine is in the 'READY' state. This assignment uses a simple equality check to determine if the current state of the sysytem is 'READY'. Therefore, when the state is 'READY', 'rdy_busy_n' is high, indicating system readiness and when the state is not 'READY', 'rdy_busy_n' remains low indicating the system is busy.
