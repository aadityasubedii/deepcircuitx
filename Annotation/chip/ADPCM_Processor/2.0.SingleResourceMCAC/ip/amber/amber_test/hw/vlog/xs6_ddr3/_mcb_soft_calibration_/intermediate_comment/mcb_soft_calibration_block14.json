    "block_comment": "The block is a state machine that controls the transition of the system between different states based on the `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` signal. When the `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` signal is not ready (logical low/false), the system continues to stay in its current state, `UDQS_WAIT1`. However, when the `MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` signal is ready (logical high/true), the system transitions to the `UDQS_WRITE_NEG_INDELAY` state."
