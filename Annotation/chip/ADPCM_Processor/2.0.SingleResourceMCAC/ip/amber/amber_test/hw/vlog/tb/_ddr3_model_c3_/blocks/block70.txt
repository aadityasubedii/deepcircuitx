Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is designed to carry out a timing check on data arriving at the 60th index of the input data queue (dq_in[60]). The timing check is implemented through the 'always' control structure, which listens for any changes to the dq_in[60] signal. As soon as a change is detected in the dq_in[60] signal, the block triggers the 'dq_timing_check' function for the 60th index, ensuring that the data meets the correct timing specifications.
