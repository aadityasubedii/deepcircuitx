Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for synchronized transmission control in a digital communication module. Upon the system reset or a positive edge on the Write Back Clock(WB_CLK_I), this block comes into action. If the system is in reset state, the transmission flag `TxDoneSync1` is asynchronously reset to maintain data integrity. If Reset is not asserted, `TxDoneSync1` takes the value of `TxDone` at every rising edge of `WB_CLK_I`, indicating the completion of a transmission cycle.
