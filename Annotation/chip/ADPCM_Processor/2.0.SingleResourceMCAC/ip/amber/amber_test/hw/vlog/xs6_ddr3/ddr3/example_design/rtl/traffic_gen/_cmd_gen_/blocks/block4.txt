Comment: 
This block is a synchronous, clock-gated block that updates the 'bl_out' signal based on signal 'bl_mode_reg'. Following a rising edge of 'clk_i', if 'mode_load_pulse' is high, the 'bl_out' signal is set to 'fixed_bl_i' after a propagation delay defined by TCQ. Otherwise, if 'cmd_clk_en' is high, a case statement is used to set 'bl_out' based on 'bl_mode_reg'. For 'bl_mode_reg' equals to 0, 1, and 2, 'bl_out' is updated with 'bram_bl_i', 'fixed_bl_i', and 'prbs_brlen', respectively. For any other value, 'bl_out' defaults to an hexadecimal value of 1.
