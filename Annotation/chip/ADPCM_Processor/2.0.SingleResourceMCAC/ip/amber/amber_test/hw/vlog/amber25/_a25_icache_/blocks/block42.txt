This block of code is used to determine the `fill_state` status. It evaluates whether variable `c_state` is equal to 'CS_FILL3'. If this condition holds true, it assigns the boolean value '1' to `fill_state` indicating that the fill state is true. Else, the `fill_state` is set to '0' signifying that the fill state is false. This is a combinational logic block implemented using the assign keyword in Verilog.
