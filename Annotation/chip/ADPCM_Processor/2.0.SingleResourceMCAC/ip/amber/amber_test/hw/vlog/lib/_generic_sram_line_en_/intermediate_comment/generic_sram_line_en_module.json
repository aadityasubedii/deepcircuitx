    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'generic_sram_line_en' module serves as a synchronous SRAM unit with a read and write port. Its memory array 'mem', configurable in size and initial value, stores data; control signals guide memory operations, and 'i' counts for resets. Unused inputs allow for future testability enhancements. The module segregates tasks into a reset and a read/write block for simplicity and maintainability of the code."
