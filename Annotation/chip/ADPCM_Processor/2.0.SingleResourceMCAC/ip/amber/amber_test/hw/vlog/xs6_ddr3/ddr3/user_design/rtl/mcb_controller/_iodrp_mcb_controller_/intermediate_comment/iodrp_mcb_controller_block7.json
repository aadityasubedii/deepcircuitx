    "block_comment": "This block describes the process of reading data through a shift register under specific conditions in a synchronous logic design. At every positive edge of DRP_CLK, if the sync_rst signal is active, the read_data is reset to zero; otherwise, when the state machine is in state ALMOST_READY3, read_data retrieves its value from shift_through_reg. Hence, the block handles two scenarios \u2013 input signal synchronization reset and data shifting under a defined machine state."
