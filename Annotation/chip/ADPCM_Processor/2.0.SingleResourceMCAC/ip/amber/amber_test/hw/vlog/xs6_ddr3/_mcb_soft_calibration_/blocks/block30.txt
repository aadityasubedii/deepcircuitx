The block is a part of a control engine defining transactional operations with the Memory Controller Block (MCB). It sets the MCB User Interface Address (MCB_UIADDR) to the UDQS clock signal, enabling the address lines to time with the data strobe signal to allow for data transfer. It also sets the MCB command valid bit (MCB_CMD_VALID) to 1, signifying that a valid operation is ready for execution. Finally, it operates a state machine that checks the MCB ready/busy flag (MCB_RDY_BUSY_N). If MCB is ready (not busy), the state machine moves to the UDQS clock pre-termination write state (UDQS_CLK_WRITE_P_TERM). However, if MCB is busy, the state machine advances to the "wait for UDQS clock pre-termination" state (UDQS_CLK_P_TERM_WAIT).
