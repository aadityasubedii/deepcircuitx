This block is responsible for debug messaging related to Co-Processor operations. On every clock cycle where fetches are not stalled, it checks whether a write or read operation is to be performed. If a write operation (i_copro_operation == 2'd2) is detected, according to the co-processor register number (i_copro_crn), it displays a message with the write data and information about the Co-Processor operation. Similar steps are followed for the read operation where, if detected (copro_operation_d1 == 2'd1), it displays the register contents being read from with corresponding register information.
