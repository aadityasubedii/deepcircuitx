    "block_comment": "This block helps in defining a synchronous counter that counts the number of read data. This is achieved by updating `rd_data_counts` on every clock pulse if `mcb_rd_en_o` signal is enabled. However, if the `dcount_rst` signal is active, the counter `rd_data_counts` will be reset."
