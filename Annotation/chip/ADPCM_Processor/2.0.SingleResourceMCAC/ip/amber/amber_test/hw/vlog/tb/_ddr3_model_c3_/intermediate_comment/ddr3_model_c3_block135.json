    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to initiate the dm_timing_check function when the 13th bit (indexed by 12 - since Verilog uses zero indexing) of the dm_in bus changes. Implementation-wise, it uses an always construct, which is event-driven. In this case, the event triggering the block to execute is a change in the state of dm_in[12]. It specifically calls upon the dm_timing_check method, passing in '12' as an argument, whenever a change occurs in the 13th bit of the dm_in register."
