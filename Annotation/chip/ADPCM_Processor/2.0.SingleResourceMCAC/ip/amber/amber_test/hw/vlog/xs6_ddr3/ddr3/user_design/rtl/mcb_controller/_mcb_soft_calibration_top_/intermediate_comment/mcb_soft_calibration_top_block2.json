    "block_comment": "The function of this block of code is to reset certain registers. When a reset event (RST) is detected or there's a positive edge on the UI_CLK signal, it sets the value of ZIO_IN_R1, ZIO_IN_R2, RZQ_IN_R1, and RZQ_IN_R2 to zero. This block is particularly useful in initializing these registers to known states at the beginning of a computational logic or during system errors."
