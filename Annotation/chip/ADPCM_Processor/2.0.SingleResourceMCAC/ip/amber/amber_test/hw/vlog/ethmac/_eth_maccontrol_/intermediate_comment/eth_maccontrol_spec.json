    "spec": "Module name: eth_maccontrol\n\nModule specification: The eth_maccontrol module is a core component of an Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) system tasked with handling control frames on both the outgoing (transmission) and incoming (reception) sides. It interfaces with transmit and receive control modules, managing notable signals such as Start Frame, End Frame, data in and data out, done, and abort. Additionally, it is responsible for formulating pause frames and reacts accordingly to incoming control frames. The module operates under two primary clock domains, one for transmission (MTxClk) and another for reception (MRxClk).\n\nInput Ports: These include clocks for transmission and reception (MTxClk and MRxClk respectively), reset signals (TxReset and RxReset), transmit data inputs (like TxDataIn, TxStartFrmIn, and TxEndFrmIn), control signals (e.g., TPauseRq and CrcEnIn), and receive-related signals (e.g., RxData and RxValid). Control flags such as TxFlow and RxFlow, as well as specific mode signals like r_PassAll, are also part of the input ports.\n\nOutput Ports: These include transmission data (TxDataOut, TxStartFrmOut, TxEndFrmOut, etc.), transmission control signals (like TxDoneOut and TxAbortOut), and indicators and flags regarding control frame transmission (WillSendControlFrame, TxCtrlEndFrm etc.). Outputs also include signals like CrcEnOut and PadOut, which controls the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) operation and manages padding to ensure minimum packet size, respectively.\n\nInternal Signals: Notably, there are latches and multiplexers for managing the \"abort\" and \"done\" states in transmission (e.g., TxUsedDataOutDetected, TxAbortInLatched, TxDoneInLatched, MuxedDone, and MuxedAbort). Additionally, wires are used for control frame-related operations (e.g., Pause, TxCtrlStartFrm, ControlData, CtrlMux, and SendingCtrlFrm) and to control transmission progression (BlockTxDone).\n\nCode Blocks: The code contains multiple blocks, each serving specific functions. For instance, some blocks manage internal signals based on conditions as per transmission states and reset signals. Others assign values to output signals based either directly on corresponding input signals or on logical outcomes of internal and input signals. Lastly, eth_receivecontrol and eth_transmitcontrol blocks are instantiated to manage the receive and transmit functionalities of the ethernet MAC control subsystem respectively.",

It is triggered by `TxUsedDataOut` or reset on transmission completion or abortion.\n\n2. `TxAbortInLatched`: A latched version of the `TxAbortIn` signal. This register latches the `TxAbortIn` when not in reset, providing a delay or storage functionality for the signal.\n\n3. `TxDoneInLatched`: A latched version of the `TxDoneIn` signal. Similar to `TxAbortInLatched`, this latches the `TxDoneIn` when not in reset, acting as a delay or storage for the signal.\n\n4. `MuxedDone`: A multiplexed version of the `TxDoneIn` signal. This signal is an outcome of conditions ranging from frame start to frame transmission completion when `TxUsedDataOutDetected` is high.\n\n5. `MuxedAbort`: A multiplexed version of the `TxAbortIn` signal. Similar to `MuxedDone`, this signal gets triggered based on conditions from frame start to transmission abortion when `TxUsedDataOutDetected` is high.\n\n6. `Pause`: A wire that holds a signal corresponding to the pause frame condition in the Ethernet control logic.\n\n7. `TxCtrlStartFrm`: A wire providing start control to frame transmission. \n\n8. `ControlData`: A wire carrying control data for the Ethernet frame.\n\n9. `CtrlMux`: A wire representing the control multiplexer. This wire controls which set of signals are enabled for transmission -- those related to the control data or the regular dataflow.\n\n10. `SendingCtrlFrm`: A wire indicating if a control frame is being sent currently.\n\n11. `BlockTxDone`: A wire used to control the transmission in progress, it blocks the done signal from transmission until necessary."

                    "text": "Module name: eth_maccontrol\n\nModule specification: The eth_maccontrol module is a core component of an Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) system tasked with handling control frames on both the outgoing (transmission) and incoming (reception) sides. It interfaces with transmit and receive control modules, managing notable signals such as Start Frame, End Frame, data in and data out, done, and abort. Additionally, it is responsible for formulating pause frames and reacts accordingly to incoming control frames. The module operates under two primary clock domains, one for transmission (MTxClk) and another for reception (MRxClk).\n\nInput Ports: These include clocks for transmission and reception (MTxClk and MRxClk respectively), reset signals (TxReset and RxReset), transmit data inputs (like TxDataIn, TxStartFrmIn, and TxEndFrmIn), control signals (e.g., TPauseRq and CrcEnIn), and receive-related signals (e.g., RxData and RxValid). Control flags such as TxFlow and RxFlow, as well as specific mode signals like r_PassAll, are also part of the input ports.\n\nOutput Ports: These include transmission data (TxDataOut, TxStartFrmOut, TxEndFrmOut, etc.), transmission control signals (like TxDoneOut and TxAbortOut), and indicators and flags regarding control frame transmission (WillSendControlFrame, TxCtrlEndFrm etc.). Outputs also include signals like CrcEnOut and PadOut, which controls the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) operation and manages padding to ensure minimum packet size, respectively.\n\nInternal Signals: Notably, there are latches and multiplexers for managing the \"abort\" and \"done\" states in transmission (e.g., TxUsedDataOutDetected, TxAbortInLatched, TxDoneInLatched, MuxedDone, and MuxedAbort). Additionally, wires are used for control frame-related operations (e.g., Pause, TxCtrlStartFrm, ControlData, CtrlMux, and SendingCtrlFrm) and to control transmission progression (BlockTxDone).\n\nCode Blocks: The code contains multiple blocks, each serving specific functions. For instance, some blocks manage internal signals based on conditions as per transmission states and reset signals. Others assign values to output signals based either directly on corresponding input signals or on logical outcomes of internal and input signals. Lastly, eth_receivecontrol and eth_transmitcontrol blocks are instantiated to manage the receive and transmit functionalities of the ethernet MAC control subsystem respectively."
