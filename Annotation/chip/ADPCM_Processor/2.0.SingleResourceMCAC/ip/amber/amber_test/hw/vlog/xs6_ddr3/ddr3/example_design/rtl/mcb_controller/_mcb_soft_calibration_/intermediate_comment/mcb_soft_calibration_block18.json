    "block_comment": "This Verilog block represents a finite state machine (FSM) primarily used for memory control functions. It manipulates memory write dynamics by adjusting write delays and cycles. When in the LDQS_WAIT1 state, the FSM checks MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal. If 'false', it remains in the current state, otherwise it transitions to LDQS_WRITE_NEG_INDELAY state. In this next state, it sets several signals such as IODRPCTRLR_MEMCELL_ADDR, IODRPCTRLR_R_WB, IODRPCTRLR_WRITE_DATA, MCB_UIADDR, MCB_CMD_VALID, and then, based on the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N, it may remain in this state or transition to LDQS_WAIT2 state."
