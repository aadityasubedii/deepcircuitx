    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the signal ui_clk to mcb_ui_clk. The Verilog keyword 'assign' is being used here for continuous assignment. This is a simple operation that represents a wire connection between the ui_clk signal and the mcb_ui_clk signal in the hardware configuration. It essentially means that the state of mcb_ui_clk is continuously following the state of ui_clk."
