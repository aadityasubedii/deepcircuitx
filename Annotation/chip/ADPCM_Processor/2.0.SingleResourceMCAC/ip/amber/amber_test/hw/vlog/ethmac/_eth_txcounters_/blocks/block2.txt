This block is responsible for performing a bitwise AND operation on all bits of the "ByteCnt" array from indices 15 to 0. The result of the operation is then assigned to "ByteCntMax". If all bits in the specified range of array "ByteCnt" are 1, the output "ByteCntMax" will be 1, otherwise, the output will be 0. The "&" operator in the code performs the reduction AND operation ensuring the aforementioned functionality.
