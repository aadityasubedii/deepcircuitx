    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code implements a delay model for a given digital signal, specifically for an address signal. The 'always @' event control triggers a non-blocking assignment of 'addr' to 'addr_in' each time the 'addr' signal changes, implementing a certain delay characterized by 'BUS_DELAY'. This method replicates real-world signal propagation delay, which may be essential in synchronous hardware design for correct operation."
