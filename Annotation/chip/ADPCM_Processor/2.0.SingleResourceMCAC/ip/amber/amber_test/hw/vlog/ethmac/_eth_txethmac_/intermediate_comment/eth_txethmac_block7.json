    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for handling a transition condition for a \"WillTransmit\" signal in a Verilog digital system. It is designed to execute on either a rising edge of the signal 'MTxClk' or 'Reset'. If the 'Reset' signal is active (high), the 'WillTransmit' signal is de-asserted (set to logic 0) after a delay specified by 'Tp'. Otherwise, 'WillTransmit' is asserted (set to logic 1) whenever any transmission states (StartPreamble, StatePreamble, StateData, StatePAD, StateFCS, StateJam) are active, again after a delay specified by 'Tp'. The '|'(or reduction) operator is used for checking if any bit of 'StateData' is high."
