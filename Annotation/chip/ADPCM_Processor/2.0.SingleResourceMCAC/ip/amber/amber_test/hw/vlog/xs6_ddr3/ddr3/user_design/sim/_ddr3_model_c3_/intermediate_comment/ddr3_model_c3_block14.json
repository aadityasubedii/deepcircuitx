    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to perform a timing check on a Negative-Edge triggered event. It works by generating a procedural block that is activated whenever there's a positive edge in the 19th element of the 'dqs_in' array. Once activated, the block calls the dqs_neg_timing_check function using '18' as an argument."
