This block is in charge of updating the 42nd bit in the pipe_data_in register array based on certain conditions. Upon each positive edge of the input clock signal, if the third bit of the rst_i signal is high, the 42nd bit of the pipe_data_in is reset to zero. Alternatively, if the command is valid (cmd_vld is high), this bit is set to the value of instr_vld. Lastly, if the system is ready (rdy_i is high) and there is valid data in the pipeline (pipe_out_vld is high), this bit is reset to zero.
