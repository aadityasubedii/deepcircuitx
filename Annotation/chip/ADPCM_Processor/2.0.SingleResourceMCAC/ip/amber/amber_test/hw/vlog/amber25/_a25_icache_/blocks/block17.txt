The function block 'pick_way' is used to determine which way should be picked based on the validity of bits and a random number. It employs a combination of conditional statements and a 'case' selection structure to make the decision. If the first bit in 'valid_bits' is not valid, 'pick_way' is set to '2'b01'. Alternatively, if the second bit in 'valid_bits' isn't valid, 'pick_way' is assigned '2'b10'. If both bits are valid, 'pick_way' relies on the value of the most significant 3 bits of the 'random_num' to decide the output. For '3'd0', '3'd3', '3'd5', and '3'd6', 'pick_way' is set to '2'b10', otherwise '2'b01' is returned.
