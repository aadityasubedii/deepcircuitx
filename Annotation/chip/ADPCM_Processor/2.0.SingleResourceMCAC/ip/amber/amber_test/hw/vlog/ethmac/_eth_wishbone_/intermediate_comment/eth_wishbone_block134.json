    "block_comment": "This block handles the state of the transmit buffer under different conditions. It is especially sensitive to the clock (WB_CLK_I) and reset (Reset) signals. If a reset signal is encountered, the Transmit Status (TxStatus) is reset (set to zero value). Otherwise, if the Transmit Buffer Read (TxBDRead) and both current and previous Transmit Enable (TxEn and TxEn_q) conditions are satisfied, it updates the TxStatus with the bits 11 through 14 of the output from the RAM (ram_do[14:11]). This operation happens at the positive edge of the clock signal."
