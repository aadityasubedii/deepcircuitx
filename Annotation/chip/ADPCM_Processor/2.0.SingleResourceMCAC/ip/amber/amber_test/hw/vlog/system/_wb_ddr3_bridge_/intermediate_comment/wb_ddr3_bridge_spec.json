    "spec": "Module name: wb_ddr3_bridge. \n\nModule specification: The `wb_ddr3_bridge` module serves as a bridge between a wishbone bus interface and a DDR3 memory module. The module performs its function by executing read and write commands from the wishbone interface into the appropriate format for the DDR3 protocol, while managing commands addressing specific memory locations. The module signals upon successful operation completion and post operations signalization is embedded into the module. The module functions with debug information option for read and write operations, as indicated by the `LP_MEMIF_DEBUG` directive. The behavior of the module can also differ based on the FPGA design target, determined by the `XILINX_VIRTEX6_FPGA` flag.\n\nThe module contains multiple input ports and output ports. Input ports serve to receive operational requests, data, and status signals. The wishbone address bus (`i_wb_adr`) designates the memory address for read/write operations. There are select lines (`i_wb_sel`), write enable `i_wb_we`, and data input bus (`i_wb_dat`) serving for write operation. Additionally, there is an indication of a wishbone bus cycle (`i_wb_cyc`), data transfer cycle (`i_wb_stb`), and indications of status of different FIFOs (`i_cmd_full`, `i_wr_full`, `i_rd_data`, `i_rd_empty`). The output ports primarily serve to provide results of operations, acknowledgment, and operation status signals.\n\nInternally, the module works with signals that are responsible for initiating, preserving status, and addressing read and write operations such as `start_write`, `start_read`, `start_write_d1`, `start_read_d1`, `start_read_hold`, `wb_adr_d1`. Signals `ddr3_busy` and `read_ack` indicate the module's busyness by revealing fullness of either command FIFO or write FIFO, and successful read operation acknowledgment. A signal 'read_ready' operates with a readiness element for a read operation.\n\nThe module code splits into several blocks: starting write and read status blocks, a block of commands for DDR3, a block for write operations and a block for handling read operations. Each of these blocks holds defining signals, setting signal priorities, and executing conditions for operations. An additional block is available for the debug mode. This module specification provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of the design, functionality, and operation of the `wb_ddr3_bridge` module.",

It can be set when a read operation starts, and it is reset when the read operation is acknowledged.\n\n6. wb_adr_d1: This is a registered version of the `i_wb_adr` signal.

It helps in handling the back pressure of reading data when read FIFO is not empty.\n\n9. read_ready: This signal initially set to one and reset when `start_read` is high, meaning a read operation is started.

It is used to delay the write enable for command until the next clock cycle.\n\n4. start_read_d1: This is similar to `start_write_d1` but for the `start_read` signal. It is used to delay the read enable signal so it is effective from the next clock cycle.\n\n5. start_read_hold: This register holds the state of an ongoing read operation. It can be set when a read operation starts, and it is reset when the read operation is acknowledged.\n\n6. wb_adr_d1: This is a registered version of the `i_wb_adr` signal. The address is registered to sync it with the clock and match the timing of the rest of the operations in the module.\n\n7. ddr3_busy: This signal indicates whether the module is busy, which is the case if either a command FIFO or write FIFO is full.\n\n8. read_ack: This is a flag which is set to indicate successful read operation acknowledgement. It helps in handling the back pressure of reading data when read FIFO is not empty.\n\n9. read_ready: This signal initially set to one and reset when `start_read` is high, meaning a read operation is started. It gets set again once `read_ack` is high, i.e., the read operation has been acknowledged.\n"

The module performs its function by executing read and write commands from the wishbone interface into the appropriate format for the DDR3 protocol, while managing commands addressing specific memory locations. The module signals upon successful operation completion and post operations signalization is embedded into the module. The module functions with debug information option for read and write operations, as indicated by the `LP_MEMIF_DEBUG` directive. The behavior of the module can also differ based on the FPGA design target, determined by the `XILINX_VIRTEX6_FPGA` flag.\n\nThe module contains multiple input ports and output ports. Input ports serve to receive operational requests, data, and status signals. The wishbone address bus (`i_wb_adr`) designates the memory address for read/write operations. There are select lines (`i_wb_sel`), write enable `i_wb_we`, and data input bus (`i_wb_dat`) serving for write operation. Additionally, there is an indication of a wishbone bus cycle (`i_wb_cyc`), data transfer cycle (`i_wb_stb`), and indications of status of different FIFOs (`i_cmd_full`, `i_wr_full`, `i_rd_data`, `i_rd_empty`). The output ports primarily serve to provide results of operations, acknowledgment, and operation status signals.\n\nInternally, the module works with signals that are responsible for initiating, preserving status, and addressing read and write operations such as `start_write`, `start_read`, `start_write_d1`, `start_read_d1`, `start_read_hold`, `wb_adr_d1`. Signals `ddr3_busy` and `read_ack` indicate the module's busyness by revealing fullness of either command FIFO or write FIFO, and successful read operation acknowledgment. A signal 'read_ready' operates with a readiness element for a read operation.\n\nThe module code splits into several blocks: starting write and read status blocks, a block of commands for DDR3, a block for write operations and a block for handling read operations. Each of these blocks holds defining signals, setting signal priorities, and executing conditions for operations. An additional block is available for the debug mode. This module specification provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of the design, functionality, and operation of the `wb_ddr3_bridge` module."
