    "block_comment": "This block triggers a function called `dqs_neg_timing_check` on the positive edge of the 28th index of the `dqs_in` signal. This is an application of sensitivity list in always block, which sets the condition that a certain function (`dqs_neg_timing_check`) should be called whenever there is a positive edge transition on a specific signal (`dqs_in[28]`). It is commonly used in synchronous circuits design."
