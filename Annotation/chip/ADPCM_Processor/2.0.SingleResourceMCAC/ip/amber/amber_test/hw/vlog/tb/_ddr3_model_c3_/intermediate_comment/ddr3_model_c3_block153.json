    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a timing check guard in the given system. The function monitors the signal 'addr_in[11]' and triggers the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' procedure whenever a change in this signal is detected. It ensures the timing sanity of the design by employing the 'always @' construct to keep track of any changes and calling the specific procedure with the defined parameter (18) to handle any potential synchronization or timing issues."
