It takes inputs concerning instructions, operations and addresses, along with clock and fault information. It manages cacheable, updatable and disruptive areas of a system. Some of its outputs include data read by the co-processor, cache enabling signal, cache flush state, and cacheable area information.

It is used to determine the enabling of cache (cache_control[0]) and it's input to the o_cache_enable output.\n   \n2. cacheable_area: This is a 32-bit internal register signal keeping track of the cacheable area.

It's updated whenever a fault is detected. It's important for pinpointing the location of errors in the system.\n\n7. copro15_reg1_write: This wire signal denotes the write operation on register 1 of co-processor 15.
