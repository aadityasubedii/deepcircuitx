    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed as a check for invalid commands on a read-only port (port 4). It gets triggered whenever there's any change in the connected signals. If the 32nd to 55th bits of C_PORT_CONFIG is set to \"R32\", signifying port 4 is in read-only mode, and a command is enabled (p4_cmd_en), and further the command instruction does not match the expected pattern (both 3rd and 1st least significant bits of p4_cmd_instr are 0), then an error is printed, and the simulation is halted, indicating an illegal operation has been attempted on a read-only port."
