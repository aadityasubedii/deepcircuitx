    "block_comment": "This block of code handles serial-to-parallel conversion with support for specific output modes and data rates, defined in the instantiation of the OSERDES2 module. The module IOi_udm_0 operates under the control of the internal system reset and Clock signal ioclk90, accepting input data dqpum and dqnum, and writing enable signals dqIO_w_en_0. The output is passed through udm_oq and udm_t. The data rates, the output mode and the SERDES operation mode are set during the instantiation of the module. Statically set signals and unconnected outputs indicate a simplified operation within a larger system context."
