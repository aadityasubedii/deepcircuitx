Comment: 
This block is a Verilog RTL that handles execution control flow with conditional jumps. Upon a positive edge of the reset or clock signal, the block checks some conditions, derived from various system and control signal statuses. If the conditions are met, this block will handle a jump instruction (changing execution flow from the current instruction to a new destination instruction). The jump details including the source and destination addresses, along with the values of register 0 and register 1 at the jump time, are written to an output file.
