    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a gray code conversion of read pointer at write clock's positive edge, which is then delayed through two pipeline stages. The initial conversion of the read pointer to gray code helps to prevent erroneous data read during simultaneous reading and writing operations. The delays introduced through the pipeline stages allow synchronized data flow, providing two different timed versions of the converted read pointer for use within chosen hardware."
