Module-level comment: The mcb_traffic_gen module generates traffic for Memory Controller Block (MCB) simulations by producing read and write commands to the memory. It uses input commands and fixed-mode data to determine the operations, checks command validity using an address FIFO, and deploys a command generator and MCB flow controller for traffic management. The module also orchestrates read and write operations via respective data paths, and tracks errors and statistics through the tg_status module. The implementation extensively uses internal signals and registers to synchronize and manage data flow within the module.
