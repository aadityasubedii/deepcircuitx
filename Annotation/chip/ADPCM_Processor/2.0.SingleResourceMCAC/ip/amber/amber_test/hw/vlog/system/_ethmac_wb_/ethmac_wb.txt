Module-level comment: The ethmac_wb module serves as an interface for the Wishbone bus system, operating in both master and slave modes. It transforms incoming data based on set data width (32 or 128 bits). There are 32 inputs including address, select, write enable, write data, cycle, strobe, acknowledge, and error signals, for both master and slave. There are identical 34 outputs for the master and slave. Transformations are done within two conditional generate blocks, switched based on data width, and use an endian function for format conversion. Inputs are assigned directly to their corresponding outputs, after transformation, with no internal signals used.
