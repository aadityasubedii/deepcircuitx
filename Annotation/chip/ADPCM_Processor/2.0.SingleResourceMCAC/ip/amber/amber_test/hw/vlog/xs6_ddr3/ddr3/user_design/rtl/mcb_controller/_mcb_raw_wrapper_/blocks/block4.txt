This block generates IO buffers for the data strobe (DQS) signal lines that connect to the memory module in a DDR SDRAM interface. Depending on the memory type defined via `C_MEM_TYPE` parameter, it defines either single-ended (IOBUF) or differential signal representation (IOBUFDS) of the DQS lines. For DDR, MDDR or DDR2 memory types without DQS signal differentiation, the `IOBUF` component is instantiated with input, output, tristate control, and bi-directional pins mappings. Otherwise, for other more advanced memory types or DDR2 with different DQS signals, the differential signal buffer `IOBUFDS` is instantiated that also includes an additional negative IO buffer pin assignment.
