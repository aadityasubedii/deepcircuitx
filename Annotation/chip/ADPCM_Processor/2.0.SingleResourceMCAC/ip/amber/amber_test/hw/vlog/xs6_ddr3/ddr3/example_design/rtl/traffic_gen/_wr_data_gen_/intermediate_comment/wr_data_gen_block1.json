    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for invoking the Verilog data generation module (`v6_data_gen`) based on the condition if the target FPGA family is `VIRTEX6`. The way it functions is by taking the various inputs, some relating to the clock signal (`clk_i`), resetting signal (`rst_i[1]`), data readiness signal (`data_rdy_i`), PRBS first seed value (`prbs_fseed_i`), etc, and feeds these input to the data generation module. The parameters of this module include address width, data width, memory burst length, column width and different other parameters relating to specific functionality. There are also several command signals which start various actions in the module. The block generates an output data (`data_o`) based on these inputs and FPGA conditions."
