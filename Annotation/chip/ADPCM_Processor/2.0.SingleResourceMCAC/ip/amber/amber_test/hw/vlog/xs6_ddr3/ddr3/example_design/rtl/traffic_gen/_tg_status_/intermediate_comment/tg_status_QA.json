It primarily monitors for a 'data_error_i' signal and captures the system's state at the instance of the error for future debugging purposes. The system state includes parameters like compare data ('cmp_data_i'), read data ('rd_data_i'), compare address ('cmp_addr_i'), etc. Upon encountering a data error, 'error_status' is updated accordingly, and 'error_set' is flagged. The error is cleared when 'rst_i' or 'manual_clear_error' signals are active. It's worth noting that the 'error_status' register size depends on 'DWIDTH', the parameter that describes data width. The module operates on each clock rising edge and includes a delay defined by the 'TCQ' parameter."
