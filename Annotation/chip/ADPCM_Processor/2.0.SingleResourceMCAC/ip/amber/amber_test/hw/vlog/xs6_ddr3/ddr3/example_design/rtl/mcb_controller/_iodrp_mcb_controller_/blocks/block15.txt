This block of code operates as a state machine, specifically determining the current state of an operation or process in a system. Each state corresponds to a unique instructional phase or step within the system. In its implementation, the given block continuously monitors the `state` variable. When a change in state occurs, the `always @ (state)` statement triggers the 'case' block to execute, translating the current state to an ASCII string representation using the `state_ascii` variable and the `<=` operator. This enables a human-friendly, readable interpretation of the current system state.
