Module name: eth_fifo. 

Module specification: The eth_fifo module is an implementation of a First-in-First-out (FIFO) buffer specifically designed to handle ethernet data storage. The depth of the FIFO storage (how many data items the FIFO can hold at a time) and the width of the data (how much data can be read or written at a time) are both parameterizable attributes. 

This module includes input ports for data_in (the actual data to be stored in the FIFO), clk (the clock signal), reset (to reset the FIFO), write and read signals (to trigger write and read operations for the FIFO respectively), and clear (to clear all data in the FIFO). 

The output ports provide data_out (the data that is read from the FIFO) and the status signal of the FIFO viz., almost_full, full, almost_empty, empty and count of the data items present in the FIFO (cnt). 

The internal signals of the module include a 2D fifo array (which holds the data within the FIFO), a counter cnt (tracking the number of data items stored), and read and write pointer registers (holding the address of the next data to be read or written to the FIFO, respectively). 

The Verilog code of the module is structured into sections to initialise and control the various input and output operations of the FIFO. Depending on the hardware configuration, it might utilize distributed memory in the FPGA for data storage. In addition, the utilization of delay gates allows for propagation delay simulation, providing greater functionality control.
