The block is responsible for managing the initialization and reset of the 'start_read_r' flag based on rising edges of the input clock signal. Upon every positive edge of 'i_wb_clk', if 'start_read' is ON, the 'start_read_r' flag is configured with 'start_read' appended with three trailing zeroes; in case the 'o_wb_ack' (acknowledge signal) is ON, 'start_read_r' is reset to zero. In all other cases, 'start_read_r' value is shifted left by one, and 'start_read' is fed in from the right.
