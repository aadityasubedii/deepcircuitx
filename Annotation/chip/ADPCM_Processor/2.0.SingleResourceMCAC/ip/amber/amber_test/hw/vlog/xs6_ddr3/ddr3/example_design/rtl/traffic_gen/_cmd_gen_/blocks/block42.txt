[493, 495]
Comment: 
This block is responsible for delaying the signal 'instr_vld'. It uses a positive-edge triggered flip-flop to achieve this. The action is performed at the rising edge of the input clock signal 'clk_i'. The output 'instr_vld_dly1' will be updated one clock cycle after the 'instr_vld' input changes.
