    "block_comment": "This block of code is serving as an edge detection functionality. It will call the `dqs_neg_timing_check` function whenever there is a negative edge detected on the 11th element of the `dqs_in` array. This is implemented using the `always` keyword in Verilog, which sets up a sort of listening mechanism on changes to the specified variable or net, and `negedge` keyword, which refers to a falling-edge trigger event (i.e., the signal transitions from a high to low). The number 10 within the `dqs_neg_timing_check` function denotes that it is specifically checking the timings for the 11th element of `dqs_in`."
