This block of code handles the event-driven logic related to a specific edge change in the 'dqs_even' signal array. The 'always' block in Verilog is triggered when there's a positive edge (rising edge) change in the 14th bit of the 'dqs_even' array (as Verilog uses 0-based indexing). Once this happens, the function 'dqs_even_receiver' is invoked with '13' as an argument, which likely pertains to processing or receiving the bit value in question.
