Comment: 
This block of code is designed for command address timing check. The `always` keyword indicates that this block is always active/reactive; it continuously monitors `addr_in[8]` signal. Whenever the 9th bit of the `addr_in` changes, it triggers the `cmd_addr_timing_check` function with parameter `15`, which presumably checks if the timing constraints are met on `addr_in[8]`.
