The block of code determines whether to process 128-bit or 32-bit Wishbone data. It comes with two separate exemplary paths for 128-bit and 32-bit data. If the Wishbone data width (WB_DWIDTH) is 128 bits, it breaks down the data (i_wb_dat) into 4 32-bit chunks based on the address bits (i_wb_adr) and selects one chunk based on the value of the least significant bits. Then the selected 32-bit chunk is replicated four times for the output (o_wb_dat). For the data width of not 128 bits (presumably 32 bits), it directly works with the data (i_wb_dat) without any manipulation and assigns it to the output.
