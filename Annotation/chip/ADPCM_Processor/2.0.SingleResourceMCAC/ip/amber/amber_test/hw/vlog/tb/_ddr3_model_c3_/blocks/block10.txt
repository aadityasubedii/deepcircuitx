Line number: 
[2663, 2663]
Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code initiates a timing check function on a rising edge of the 23rd bit of the dqs_in data array. It monitors a particular line, specifically the 23rd bit of the 'dqs_in' array, for a positive-edge transition. Upon detecting a positive-edge transition, it triggers the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function, passing '22' as an argument, likely denoting the current bit being evaluated. This function presumably handles the timing evaluation and adjustment for the 'dqs_in[22]' signal transition to ensure proper synchronicity in the larger system.
