    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a refresh pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) bit during the positive edge of an input clock (clk_i). It specifically checks which type of family the clock belongs to, either 'SPARTAN6' or not. If the family is 'SPARTAN6', the third bit of 'prbs_instr_b' is ANDed with the 'refresh_cmd_en' to generate the 'refresh_prbs'. Otherwise, 'refresh_prbs' is set to 0, indicating a default or fallback case.\n"
