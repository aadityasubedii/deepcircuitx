    "block_comment": "This line of code is creating a wire assignment in Verilog for signal propagation. It assigns the value of `wdp_valid` signal to `wdp_valid_o`. The 'assign' keyword used here is for continuous assignments which means it continuously drives the output `wdp_valid_o` as soon as there is a change in `wdp_valid`. This is just a simple data forwarding operation."
