Comment: 
This block manages the most significant bits (MSB) of the transmitting pointer in a FIFO buffer. When the system is reset, the MSB of the transmitting pointer is set to 0. If the conditions for transmission and reading the pointer are true, the block retrieves the data from the ram_do and assigns it to TxPointerMSB. The block also increments TxPointerMSB when the pointer increase condition is met and is not blocked by the Increment Blocking condition.
