    "block_comment": "The block of code is a register update module for the value 'data_hit_way'. If a reset signal is detected, it resets the 'data_hit_way_r' content to zero. On the other hand, during a clock positive edge if a write hit signal is received, it updates the register 'data_hit_way_r' with the value from 'data_hit_way'. This block of code embodies a mixture of a synchronous reset and a clocked data path, commonly used in digital circuit designs."
