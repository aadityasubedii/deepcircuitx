This block of code controls the behavior of the `irq_txc` signal based on certain conditions. Upon a positive clock edge or a reset, this block resets `irq_txc` to zero if the reset is high. On detecting a `SetTxCIrq` event, it sets `irq_txc` to one after a delay `Tp`. Finally, it resets `irq_txc` back to zero if both the first element of `INT_SOURCE_Wr` and the sixth bit of `DataIn` are high, following a delay `Tp`.
