Comment: 
This block of code conditionally sets the value of the variable `sel_w1gen_logic` based on the condition of `data_mode_rr_c` variable's specific bits. If the bits 2 through 0 of `data_mode_rr_c` match either 101, 100, or 110, it sets `sel_w1gen_logic` to 1 after a delay specified by `TCQ`, otherwise to 0. It only does so at the positive edge of the clock. It is effectively a type of selection logic, conditional on certain data modes.
