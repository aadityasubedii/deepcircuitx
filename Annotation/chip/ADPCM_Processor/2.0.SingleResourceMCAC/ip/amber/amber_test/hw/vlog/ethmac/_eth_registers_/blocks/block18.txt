Comment: 
This block is a synchronous reset design in Verilog that resets the `ResetTxCIrq_sync2` variable. The system is triggered by either a rising edge on `TxClk` or `Reset`. If a rising edge signal is detected on `Reset`, the block sets `ResetTxCIrq_sync2` to 0 after a propagation delay of `Tp`. In the absence of a `Reset` signal, the value of `SetTxCIrq_sync1` will be assigned to `ResetTxCIrq_sync2` after a respective delay. The #[Tp] is a delay control that represents the physical propagation delay time, which is a mechanism to mimic real world signal behavior in a synchronous digital system design.
