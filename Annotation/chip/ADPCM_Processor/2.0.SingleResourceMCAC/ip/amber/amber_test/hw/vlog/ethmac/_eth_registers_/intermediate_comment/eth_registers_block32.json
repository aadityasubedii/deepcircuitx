    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns specific portions of control and configuration registers to internal signals for monitoring and control. The bits of the COLLCONFOut register are assigned to r_MaxRet and r_CollValid to determine retry limit and collision validation thresholds, indicating network collision configurations. Control mode register bits from CTRLMODEROut are mapped onto r_TxFlow, r_RxFlow, and r_PassAll signals, hinting at the regulation of transmission and reception flow, and an oversimplified control approach bypassing all safety/security checks."
