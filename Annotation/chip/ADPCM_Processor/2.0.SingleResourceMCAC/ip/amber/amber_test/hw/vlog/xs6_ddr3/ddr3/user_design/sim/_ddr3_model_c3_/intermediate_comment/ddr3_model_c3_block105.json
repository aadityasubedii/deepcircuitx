    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is essentially controlling a timing check for a specific bit (25th bit) of the datapath (dq_in). The always statement allows for the continuous monitoring of the 25th bit of the input dq_in. When the value of this bit changes, the function dq_timing_check is triggered with the parameter 25. This operation is necessary for ensuring the correct timing constraints of the system in regards to the specific bit of the data path."
