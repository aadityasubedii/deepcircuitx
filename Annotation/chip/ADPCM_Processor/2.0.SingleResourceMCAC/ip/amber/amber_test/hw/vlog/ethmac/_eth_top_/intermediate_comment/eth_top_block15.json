    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a resettable and clocked data flip operation with collision detection. On the rising edge of either `mtx_clk_pad_i` (master transmit clock) or `wb_rst_i` (reset signal), the code sets two internal signals, `Collision_Tx1` and `Collision_Tx2`, to a default state of zero if the `wb_rst_i` signal is high. In all other cases, `Collision_Tx1` captures the instantaneous value of `mcoll_pad_i` (presumably a transmitted collision signal), while `Collision_Tx2` is reset to zero if `ResetCollision` is true, else it echo's the value of `Collision_Tx1`. Therefore, this block provides a way to track collision state in two stages of transmission in the presence of a global reset signal."
