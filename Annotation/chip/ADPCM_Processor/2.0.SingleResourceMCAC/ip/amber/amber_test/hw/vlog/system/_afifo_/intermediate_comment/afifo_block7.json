    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the operations for a write condition in a FIFO buffer. Upon the positive edge of the write clock (`wr_clk`), it checks whether a push operation (`i_push` signal) is attempted while the buffer is not full (`!o_full`). If the condition is met, the write pointer (`wr_pointer`) is incremented by one, and input data (`i_data`) is stored to the location indicated by the updated write pointer in the FIFO data buffer (`data[wr_pointer[1:0]]`). Thus, this block aids in managing the storage of incoming data in a FIFO buffer."
