Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages the states of a Media Access Control (MAC) Transmitter on a rising edge of the Transmitter Clock (MTxClk) or a system reset. During a reset, all state variables are initialized to '0', except the 'StateDefer' which is set to '1'. If it is not a reset, the state variables update based on specific start conditions. Every state variable corresponds to a phase in transmitting data (Idle, Preamble, Data, PAD, FCS, etc.) and will be set or reset depending on the related start signals' values. Start signals like 'StartData', 'StartIPG', 'StartIdle', are likely external inputs that trigger the specific state transitions, and these transitions are modeled with if-else conditions inside the always block.
