It takes various input signals related to instruction execution and decodes them to generate human-readable assembly-like output. The module analyzes the instruction type, opcode, and operands to reconstruct the assembly representation of each executed instruction. It also handles interrupts and memory operations, writing the decompiled instructions and other relevant information to a file for debugging or analysis purposes. The module is designed to work alongside the processor core, providing real-time instruction decoding and logging capabilities."
