    "block_comment": "This block acts as a control trigger for the signal 'cke_train_reg'. This is managed using several conditions triggered by 'ui_clk' and 'int_sys_rst'. Upon an integer system reset, 'cke_train_reg' is set to 0. However, if system reset is not given and 'wait_200us_done_r1' is high while 'wait_200us_done_r2' is low, 'cke_train_reg' is set to 1. It resets again to 0 when 'uo_done_cal' evaluates to true. The block efficiently manages 'cke_train_reg' transitioning as per system signals and flags."
