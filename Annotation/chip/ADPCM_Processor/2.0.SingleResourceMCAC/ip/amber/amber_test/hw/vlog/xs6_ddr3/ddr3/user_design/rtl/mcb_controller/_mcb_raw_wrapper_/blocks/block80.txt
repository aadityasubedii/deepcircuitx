This code block is an error checker for a specific configuration and command in a Verilog design. It monitors the `C_PORT_CONFIG` and `p3_cmd_en` signals and terminates the simulation with an error message when an invalid command is issued. Specifically, when `C_PORT_CONFIG[87:64]` matches the pattern "R32", `p3_cmd_en` is active high, and the least significant bit and the third bit of `p3_cmd_instr` are both low, it is considered an invalid command for read-only port 3. The block uses an always block and nested if-statement to watch for these specific conditions.
