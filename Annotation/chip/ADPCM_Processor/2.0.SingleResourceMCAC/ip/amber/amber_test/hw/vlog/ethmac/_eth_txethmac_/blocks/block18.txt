Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code represents a sequential circuit which is a Status Latch. This latch gets reset whenever a positive edge of the Reset signal or MTxClk clock signal is detected. The StatusLatch is set to '0' if either Reset signal is high or the negation of TxStartFrm signal is true. On the other hand, if either ExcessiveDeferOccured signal or StateIdle signal is high, the StatusLatch is set to '1'. The system makes use of '#Tp' delay which stands for propagation delay to make sure signals propagate properly through the latch.
