    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily acts as a status signal generator for a buffer, dictating its 'empty' state. It comes into action at the rising edge of the read clock (rd_clk). If a reset signal is encountered (rst), the 'empty' signal is set to true, regardless of other conditions. Conversely, if the buffer is not filled (buf_filled == 0) or if it's partially filled but a read strobe signal is received (buf_filled == 1 && rd_strobe), the 'empty' signal is still set to true. In all other cases, the 'empty' signal is set to false, indicating that there is data in the buffer."
