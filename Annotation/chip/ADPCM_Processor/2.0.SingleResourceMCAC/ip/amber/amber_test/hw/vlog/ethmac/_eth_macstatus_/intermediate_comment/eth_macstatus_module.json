    "module": "Module-level Comment: The eth_macstatus module manages status operations of an Ethernet Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. It receives various input signals related to transmission/reception operations, error checks, and system status, processing them to update status flags, which are outputted for higher-level operations or error management. The module is composed of several always blocks that handle clock-controlled operations and assign statements for direct signal assignments. The internal architecture is designed to handle a wide range of states and errors detected during transmit/receive process in Ethernet MAC layer. Extensive error checking and status flag updates ensure proper functionality and error detection within the system."
