    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to continually monitor the 54th bit of the dq_in array and trigger the dq_timing_check function when this bit changes. To accomplish this, an \"always @\" block is used in Verilog to create a process that continually checks for changes in the 54th bit (53rd index) and then calls dq_timing_check(53) when a change is detected. This method allows for real-time monitoring and action upon occurrence of specific events within a large bit array."
