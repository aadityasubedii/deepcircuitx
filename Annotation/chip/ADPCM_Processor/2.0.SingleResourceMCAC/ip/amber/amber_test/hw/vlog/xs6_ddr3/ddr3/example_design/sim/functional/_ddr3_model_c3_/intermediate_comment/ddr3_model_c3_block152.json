    "block_comment": "This block of code serves to monitor a specific bit of the 'addr_in' signal and initiate the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function whenever there is a change in the state of bit 12 of 'addr_in'. It does this by utilizing 'always @' control flow construct which triggers the execution of the code inside the block whenever there is a change in any of the signals in its sensitivity list. In this case bit 12 of 'addr_in' signal is in the sensitivity list triggering the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function with argument 19."
