The main functions of this module include handling Wishbone communication protocol, handling, resetting, and monitoring specific system functions such as interrupts, random number generation, UART communication, and hardware mechanisms like LED and PHY interfaces. The Wishbone protocol is implemented for data read & write, utilizing input and output parameters like address (i_wb_adr), select (i_wb_sel), write enable (i_wb_we), data out (o_wb_dat), and data in (i_wb_dat). It also involves control cycle (i_wb_cyc), strobe (i_wb_stb), acknowledgment (o_wb_ack), and error signals (o_wb_err). Multi-case scenarios are considered with each read & write sequence, including interrupts, timers, control & status registers of UART, memory control, and digital signals like LED and PHY_RST. Each case includes an address with specific functionality expected."
