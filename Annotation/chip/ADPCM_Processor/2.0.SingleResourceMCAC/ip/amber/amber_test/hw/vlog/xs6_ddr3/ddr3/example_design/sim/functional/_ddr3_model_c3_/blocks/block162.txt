Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for triggering a timing check on command addresses. Specifically, it accomplishes this by continuously monitoring the third bit of the input address (`addr_in[2]`). Whenever there's a change in this particular bit of `addr_in`, the function `cmd_addr_timing_check()` is called with an argument of `9`, initiating the timing check process for the command address.
