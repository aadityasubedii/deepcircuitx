    "block_comment": "The Verilog block primarily handles bitwise shift operations based on certain input conditions. The block divides logic into sections based on the shifting function: Logical Shift Left (LSL), Logical Shift Right (LSR), Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR), and Rotate Right (ROR). At the beginning, it stores shift values and input flags. Different cases are tackled in the conditional 'if' block inside which the shift operation's function modifies the internal flags `shift_nzero` and `shift_over`. The actual shifting operation is implemented through a series of 'case i_function' assignments, where shift values are assigned to `low_selector`, `lsl_selector`, `lsr_selector`, while `direction` gets either 0 or 1 based on the function. For ASR, an additional sign-check operation is executed at the end."
