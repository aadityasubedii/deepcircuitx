Comment: 
This block is responsible for conditionally assigning values to several command variables used in the Memory Interface Generator (MIG) based on the fourth port enable signal (C_PORT_ENABLE[4]). If this signal is high, it assigns the corresponding port 4 variables to the MIG variables, with the block length (bl) getting a bit-wise OR of the instruction's third bit and the fifth bit of the block length. Else, in case the enable signal is not high, it simply assigns all those MIG signals to low (0).
