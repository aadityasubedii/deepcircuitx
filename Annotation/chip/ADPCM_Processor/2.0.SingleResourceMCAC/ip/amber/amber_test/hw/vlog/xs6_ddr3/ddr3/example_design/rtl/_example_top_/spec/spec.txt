Module name: example_top. Module specification: This module is a top-level design for a DDR3 SDRAM memory controller interface, named example_top. It implements a memory controller with multiple ports for command, write, and read operations, supporting up to 6 ports (p0 to p5). The module has input ports for system clock (c3_sys_clk) and reset (c3_sys_rst_i), and output ports for various DDR3 SDRAM interface signals including address (mcb3_dram_a), bank address (mcb3_dram_ba), control signals (ras_n, cas_n, we_n, odt, reset_n, cke), and data signals (mcb3_dram_dq). It also has bidirectional ports for data strobe signals (dqs/udqs) and a reference impedance connection
