This block of code initializes simulation variables, checks certain parameter constraints, and sets the time format for simulation tracing. At the start, two conditional statements ensure the BL_MAX parameter is at least 2 and 2 to the power of BO_BITS is not greater than BL_MAX. Following these checks, the simulation time format is set in picoseconds, and the seed for the random number generation is initialized with RANDOM_SEED. Finally, the clock counter ck_cntr is reset to zero.
