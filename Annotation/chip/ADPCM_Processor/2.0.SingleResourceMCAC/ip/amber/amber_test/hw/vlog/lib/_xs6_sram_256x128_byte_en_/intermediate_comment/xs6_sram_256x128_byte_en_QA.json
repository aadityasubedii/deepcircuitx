It utilizes a 128-bit data width and an 8-bit address width. This hardware is being design using Verilog with Xilinx specific primitives. Upon every positive edge of the input clock (i_clk), the module checks if writing is enabled (i_write_enable). If it is, the data (i_write_data) is written in the memory location specified by the input address (i_address). The simultaneous reading and writing are operating in 'read first' mode for both memory blocks. The data to be written is byte-enabled, allowing for selective writing on specific bytes. The read data is outputted through o_read_data. The module also checks whether correct parameter values for DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH have been passed and displays warning messages in case of incorrect values."

The signal is assigned as a bitwise AND operation between the expanded write enable signal, replicated according to the byte size of the data, and the input byte enable signal. This internal connection makes sure that the byte-wise write operation is only possible when both i_write_enable and the corresponding bit in i_byte_enable are set to '1'.
