    "block_comment": "This block is a reset-state determination module for a transmission retry register \"TxRetry\". It operates synchronously on the rise (posedge) of either MTxClk (a master transmit clock) or Reset. If there is a Reset signal, the 'TxRetry' register is set to 0 after a propagation delay 'Tp', indicating a reset state. Conversely, if a transmitting process begins and there is no status latch ('TxStartFrm & ~StatusLatch'), 'TxRetry' is again set to 0 after 'Tp', meaning that a retry is not needed. However, in the case that retry is activated ('StartTxRetry'), 'TxRetry' is set to 1 after delay 'Tp', signaling a command for a retry."
