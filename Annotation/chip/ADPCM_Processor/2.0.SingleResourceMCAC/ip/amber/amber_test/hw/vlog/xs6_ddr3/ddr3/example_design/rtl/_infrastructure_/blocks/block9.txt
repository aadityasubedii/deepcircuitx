Comment: 
This is a block of Verilog code responsible for clock signal management in a digital system. It instantiates a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) component with advanced features (`PLL_ADV`), using it for generation and division of clock signals for different parts of the digital system. Important parameters like input clock periods, output clock divisors, and phase shifts are specified. An internal compensation method is used for signal stability. Signals are named according to their functionality, such as input clocks, reset, feedback, and various output clocks serving different logic circuits. Notably, several outputs and control lines are left unconnected, presumably unused in this context.
