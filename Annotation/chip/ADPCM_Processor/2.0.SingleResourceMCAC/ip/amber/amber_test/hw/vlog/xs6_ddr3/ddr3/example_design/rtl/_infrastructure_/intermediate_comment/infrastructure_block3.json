    "block_comment": "The block generates a reset signal for the system. It does this by combining two sources of reset signals - the system reset (`sys_rst`) and the logical inverse (`~`) of the power-up phase-locked loop locked signal (`syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked`), using a logical OR operation. If either `sys_rst` is high, or `syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked` is low, the resultant `rst_tmp` signal is set high, thereby triggering a system reset."
