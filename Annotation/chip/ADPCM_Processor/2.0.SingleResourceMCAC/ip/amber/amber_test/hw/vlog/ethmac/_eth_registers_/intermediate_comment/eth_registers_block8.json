    "block_comment": "The block of code is a sequential logic block driven by a clock signal 'Clk' and asynchronous reset 'Reset'. Upon a positive edge trigger of these inputs, the block manages the state of the 'irq_txe' signal. When 'Reset' is high, 'irq_txe' is set to zero immediately. If 'Reset' is not high and if the 'TxE_IRQ' signal is true, 'irq_txe' is set to one after a propagation delay 'Tp'. If 'TxE_IRQ' is not true and both 'INT_SOURCE_Wr[0]' and 'DataIn[1]' signals are true, 'irq_txe' is set to zero after the same propagation delay 'Tp'."
