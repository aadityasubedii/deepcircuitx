    "block_comment": "The block of code handles synchronous resetting of the 'SetTxCIrq_sync2' signal in response to rising edges of the 'Reset' or 'Clk' signals. The function is implemented using an always block triggered by the positive edge of either the 'Reset' or 'Clk' signals. If a reset is detected, the 'SetTxCIrq_sync2' signal is synchronously reset; in all other circumstances, 'SetTxCIrq_sync2' simply takes the value of 'SetTxCIrq_sync1'. This helps maintain synchronization and stability within the design."
