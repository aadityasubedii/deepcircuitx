    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for controlling the transition of `State_Start_DynCal` during dynamic calibration. It drives the `State_Start_DynCal` signal based on the `STATE` signal and a reset `RST`. A synchronous reset has been implemented such that `State_Start_DynCal` is set to low (1'b0) when `RST` is active. When the `STATE` signal matches `START_DYN_CAL`, `State_Start_DynCal` gets set to high (1'b1). In all other cases, `State_Start_DynCal` stays low (1'b0)."
