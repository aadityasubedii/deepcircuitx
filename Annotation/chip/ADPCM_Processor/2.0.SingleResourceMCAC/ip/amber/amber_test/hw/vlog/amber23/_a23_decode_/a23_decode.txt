Module-level comment: This module decodes ARM instructions and generates control signals for the execution stage. It implements a state machine to handle various instruction types, including data processing, memory operations, branches, and coprocessor instructions. The module processes input signals, decodes the instruction, and produces control signals for register selection, ALU operations, memory access, and status bit management. It also handles interrupts, exceptions, and different processor modes, ensuring proper execution flow and state transitions based on the decoded instructions and system events.
