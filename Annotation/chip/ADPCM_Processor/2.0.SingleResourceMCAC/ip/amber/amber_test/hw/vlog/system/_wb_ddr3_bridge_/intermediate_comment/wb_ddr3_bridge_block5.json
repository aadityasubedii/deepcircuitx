    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is primarily focused on setting up memory commands in a DDR3 module. The function is triggered specifically at the positive edge of the input clock (i_clk). It sets up the o_cmd_byte_addr command by aligning the write back address (wb_adr_d1) to the lower 26 bits, padding on the right with zeroes. The command enable flag (o_cmd_en) becomes true when the DDR3 module is not busy and either a read (start_read_d1) or a write (start_write_d1) operation is requested. Depending on whether a write or read operation is flagged, it assigns the write (3'd0) or read (3'd1) instruction to o_cmd_instr."
