    "block_comment": "This block of code is dedicated to implementing a timing check function. The function is invoked whenever there's a change detected in the 28th bit (index 27) of the 'dq_in' vector. This asynchronous behavior is managed using the 'always' keyword at the sensitivity list that is triggered by any change in the bit position 'dq_in[27]'."
