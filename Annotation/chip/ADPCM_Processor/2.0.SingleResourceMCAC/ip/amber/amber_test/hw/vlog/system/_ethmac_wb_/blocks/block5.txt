The block of code is for managing endian-ness conversion of data according to address mappings in the Wishbone module. Depending on the width of the data bus, the code block switches between 32 and 128-bit functionality. For 128-bit width, it uses select line (`i_m_wb_adr[3:2]`) to choose the appropriate segments of the data (`i_m_wb_rdat`, `i_m_wb_sel`, `i_m_wb_wdat`), and also applies endian conversion. For 32-bit width, it directly applies endian conversion to the respective input data.
