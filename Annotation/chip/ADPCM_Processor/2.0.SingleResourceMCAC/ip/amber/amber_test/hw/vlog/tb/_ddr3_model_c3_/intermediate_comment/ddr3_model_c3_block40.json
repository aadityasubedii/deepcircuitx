    "block_comment": "This block of code triggers a function whenever there is a negative edge transition on the 26th bit of dqs_in. It accomplishes its purpose by using the always @ construct in Verilog that monitors for changes in the specified signal - in this case, the 26th bit of the dqs_in array. When this bit undergoes a negative transition, the function dqs_pos_timing_check() is called with the integer 25 as its argument."
