    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'data_prbs_gen' is a PRBS generator employing LFSR for sequence generation. It is controlled by various inputs: clock-related ('clk_i', 'clk_en'), reset signals ('rst_i'), PRBS seed initializer ('prbs_seed_init'), and the seed ('prbs_fseed_i', 'prbs_seed_i'). Depending on these inputs, the LFSR operates, driven by specific logic that helps generate a PRBS which is forwarded to the output ('prbs_o'). This module aids in generating PRBS for different purposes like testing and debugging."
