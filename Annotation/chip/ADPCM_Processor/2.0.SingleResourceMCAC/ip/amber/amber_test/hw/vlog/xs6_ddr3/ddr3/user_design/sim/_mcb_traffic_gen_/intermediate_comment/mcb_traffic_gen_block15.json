    "block_comment": "The block of code performs the function of assigning the value of the `mcb_cmd_full_i` input signal to the `cmd_full` variable. The `assign` statement, a continuously evaluated procedural statement in Verilog, is used to achieve this. The process happens whenever there's a change in the `mcb_cmd_full_i`, the `cmd_full` will be updated accordingly."
