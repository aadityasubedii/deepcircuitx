    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code is performing a wire assignment operation. The function of this single statement block is to output the value of the internal register 'rdp_valid' to the externally exposed signal 'rdp_valid_o'. This operation is done continuously, i.e., whenever there is a change in the value of the 'rdp_valid' signal, that change is instantly reflected on 'rdp_valid_o' due to the 'assign' keyword, ensuring real-time tracking of 'rdp_valid'."
