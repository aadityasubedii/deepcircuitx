    "block_comment": "This block of code is instrumental in handling the Reception Ready flag (RxReady) in a system which communicates data. It primarily checks for conditions about transmission status and accordingly updates the 'RxReady' flag. The process is triggered on the positive edge of the WB_CLK_I (clock) signal or upon receipt of a Reset signal. On Reset, the 'RxReady' flag is immediately set to 0. Under normal operation, if a shift operation has ended, certain abort conditions are met, or reception is disabled while it was previously enabled ('~r_RxEn & r_RxEn_q'), the 'RxReady' flag is set to 0. However, if the reception is enabled (RxEn & RxEn_q) and the pointer has read the data (RxPointerRead), the 'RxReady' flag is then set to 1 which signifies completion and readiness of reception."
