    "block_comment": "The block of code handles the assignment of I/O signals of the memory interface block. Depending on certain conditions, these signals are either assigned certain values or set to 0. The active condition assigns respective signals, mig_p1_wr_clk, mig_p1_rd_clk (write and read clocks), mig_p1_wr_en, mig_p1_wr_mask (write enable and mask), mig_p1_wr_data (write data), mig_p1_rd_en (read enable), and others to respective input or internal signals. This effectively maps the defined input and output to signals used in the memory block. If the condition is not met, these signals are reset to 0."
