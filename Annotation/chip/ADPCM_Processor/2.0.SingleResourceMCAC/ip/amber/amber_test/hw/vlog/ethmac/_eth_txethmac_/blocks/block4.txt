Comment: 
This part of the Verilog code is involved in handling CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) for transmission data. The block uses the state of FCS (Frame Check Sequence) to enable or disable the CRC process. If the StateFCS is 0 (inactive), the CRC operation is enabled. The CRC data is obtained from the transmission data TxData based on the status of StateData. If the first bit of StateData is 1, TxData[3] to TxData[0] are selected for the 4-bit CRC data. If the first bit of StateData is not 1 but the second bit is 1, TxData[7] to TxData[4] are selected for the CRC data. If both the bits are not 1, the CRC data bits are set to 0.
