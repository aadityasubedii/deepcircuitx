Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module is a top-level interface for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) in a Xilinx FPGA design, integrating up to 6 AXI interfaces with the MCB. It handles memory access requests from different AXI ports, including arbitration, command and data handling, and supports various memory types and configurations. The module has numerous input and output ports, including clock and reset signals, port-specific control signals, AXI interface signals, and memory interface signals. Key inputs include sysclk_2x, pll_lock, sys_rst, and AXI interface signals for each enabled port. Outputs include memory interface signals (e.g., mcbx_dram_addr, mcbx_dram_ba), status signals, and AXI interface response signals. Internal signals are used for connecting AXI interfaces to the
