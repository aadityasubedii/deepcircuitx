    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for determining whether a write miss condition is occurring. A write miss condition is defined as a situation where the system is trying to write data but the required data block is unavailable. This condition is detected when there's an existing request hold (`request_hold`), write enable signal (`i_write_enable`) is active, but there's no hit in the current idle state (`!idle_hit`) and no consecutive writes are occurring (`!consecutive_write`)."
