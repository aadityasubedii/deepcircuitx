Comment: 
This block of code manages the output enable (`ram_oe`) signal for some RAM block based on various conditions. `ram_oe` is set to high when any of the following three conditions hold true. First, when both `BDRead`, `WbEn`, and `WbEn_q` signals are asserted simultaneously, it implies that the writeback is enabled and is currently reading from the buffer descriptor. Second, when `TxEn`, `TxEn_q` signals and either `TxBDRead` or `TxPointerRead` are asserted, implying the transaction is enabled and is either reading from the transaction buffer descriptor or the transaction pointer. Lastly, when `RxEn`, `RxEn_q`, and either `RxBDRead` or `RxPointerRead` are high, indicating that the reception is enabled and is reading from either the reception buffer descriptor or the reception pointer.
