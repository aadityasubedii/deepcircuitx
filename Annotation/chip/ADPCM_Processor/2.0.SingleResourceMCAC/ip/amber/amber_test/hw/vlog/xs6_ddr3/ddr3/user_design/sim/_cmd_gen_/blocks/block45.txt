Comment: 
This block of code essentially captures and updates the mode of instruction. Every rising edge of the clock signal (clk_i), the current instruction mode, as per 'instr_mode_i' input, is registered to the 'instr_mode_reg' variable with a delay denoted by the constant '#TCQ'. This is commonly used in synchronous digital systems to store input state aligned with the system timing governed by the clock signal.
