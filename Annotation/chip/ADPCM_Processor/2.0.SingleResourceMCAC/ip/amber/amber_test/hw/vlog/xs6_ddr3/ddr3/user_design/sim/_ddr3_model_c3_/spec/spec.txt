Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, implementing timing and behavior of DDR3 memory including command decoding, address handling, data read/write operations, and various timing checks. It has input ports for clock (ck, ck_n), control signals (cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank inputs (ba, addr), data signals (dq, dqs, dqs_n), and other control inputs (rst_n, dm_tdqs, odt). The module has a single output port tdqs_n for termination data strobe. Internal signals include timing parameters, state tracking variables, pipelines for various operations, and memory storage. The code is structured into several main blocks: initialization, command decoding, data input/output handling, and extensive timing checks
