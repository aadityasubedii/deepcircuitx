    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for state transition in a Finite State Machine (FSM). At each positive edge of the input clock signal, it checks the state of the reset input signal. If the reset signal is high, it forces the current_state to a predefined idle state (5'b00001). If the reset signal is not high, it simply allows the FSM to transition to the next state as determined by the transitions defined elsewhere in the system."
