    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to perform a timing check. It does so using an 'always' block that becomes sensitive to any changes to the 6th bit of the `dq_in` signal. Whenever this happens, the `dq_timing_check` function with parameter '5', is executed, performing the necessary timing checks."
