Comment: 
This block handles activities on various registers under different operations upon every positive edge of the clock or reset signal. If a reset signal is detected, no operation occurs. If `i_core_stall` is low, thus no core stall, it performs debugging messages for either write-to or read-from operations to co-processor unit "Co-Pro 15". The write operations occur when `i_copro_operation` equals '2', and are classified based on the value of `i_copro_crn`, whereas read operations, signaled by `copro_operation_d1` being '1', are differentiated using `copro_crn_d1` value, showing the details of the register being interacted with and its status.
