This block controls the read operation of a command FIFO (First In, First Out) queue. The logic implemented is such that a read operation is triggered if three conditions are met: the output enable signal (`mcb_cmd_en_o`) is active, the command FIFO is not full (`~mcb_cmd_full_i`) and the command FIFO is not empty (`~cmd_fifo_empty`). This prevents read conflicts and maintains the integrity of the data in the command FIFO.
