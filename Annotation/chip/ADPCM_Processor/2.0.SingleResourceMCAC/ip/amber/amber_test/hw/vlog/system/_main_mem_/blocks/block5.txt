This block of Verilog code implements a masking functionality for a data bus. The function is carried out through a loop which iterates over 16 segments of an array, using a write mask (`wr_mask[i]`) to select which data segments to write: from the read data (`rd_data[8*i+7:8*i]`) or the write data (`wr_data[8*i+7:8*i]`). In essence, it copies selected segments from read data to write data based on the write mask.
