    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a Wishbone interface for an Ethernet controller, managing data transfer between the Ethernet MAC and Wishbone bus. It handles transmit and receive operations, including buffer management, interrupt handling, and error detection. The module uses separate clock domains for Wishbone and Ethernet, synchronizing data transfer with FIFOs. It processes buffer descriptors, controls data flow, and generates interrupts based on transmission and reception events. The design includes state machines for TX/RX operations, FIFO management, and interrupt generation, ensuring efficient communication between the Ethernet MAC and the Wishbone bus."
