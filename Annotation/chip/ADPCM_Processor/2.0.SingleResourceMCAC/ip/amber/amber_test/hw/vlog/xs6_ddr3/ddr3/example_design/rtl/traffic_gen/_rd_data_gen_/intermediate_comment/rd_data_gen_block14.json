    "block_comment": "This Verilog block of code implements an edge-triggered flip-flop circuit to delay the input signals. At every rising edge of the input clock signal `clk_i`, the input digital signals `data_rdy_i` and `cmd_valid_i` are captured and their state will be updated in the next two clock cycles with a delay defined by `TCQ`. This delay implements synchronization in sequential circuits and is crucial to data integrity and consistency in designs involving multiple subsystems operating concurrently."
