    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a procedure that is sensitive to the positive edge of the MRxClk or RxReset signals. On the occurrence of RxReset or when ByteCntEq16 is high, the OpCodeOK is immediately reset to 0. However, if ByteCntEq14 or ByteCntEq15 is true and falls within the DetectionWindow, the OpCodeOK is updated based on certain conditions on the least significant byte of RxData. Specifically, OpCodeOK is set to true if RxData[7:0] equals 8'h00 for ByteCntEq14 or equals 8'h01 for ByteCntEq15 while still maintaining its previous state. \n"
