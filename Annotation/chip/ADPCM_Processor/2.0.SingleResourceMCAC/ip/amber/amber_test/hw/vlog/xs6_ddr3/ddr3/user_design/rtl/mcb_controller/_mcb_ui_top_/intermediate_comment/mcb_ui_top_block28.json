    "block_comment": "This function 'rr' determines the order of port access based on the provided port configuration and slot number. Initially, the number of available ports is set according to port configuration. Then, by scanning the port_enable input, it calculates the number of enabled ports. Finally, it generates a round-robin order of port access, storing the order in the 'rr' output. It also uses the provided slot number to generate a binary log sequence using the 'blso' procedure."
