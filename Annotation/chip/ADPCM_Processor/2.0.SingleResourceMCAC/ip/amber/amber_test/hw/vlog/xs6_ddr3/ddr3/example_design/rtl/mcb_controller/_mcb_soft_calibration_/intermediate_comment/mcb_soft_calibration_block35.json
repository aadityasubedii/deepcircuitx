    "block_comment": "This code block manages transitions between states in a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a memory controller, specifically for Load-Data-Queue-Strobe (LDQS) clock management. While in the LDQS_CLK_P_TERM_WAIT state, it waits for the MCB_RDY_BUSY_N signal to assert. Once ready, it transitions to the LDQS_CLK_WRITE_N_TERM state, setting various control and configuration parameters along the way. These include: the memory cell address, mode of operation (write), write data, the LDQS clock address and the valid command signal. It remains in this state once MCB_RDY_BUSY_N is asserted."
