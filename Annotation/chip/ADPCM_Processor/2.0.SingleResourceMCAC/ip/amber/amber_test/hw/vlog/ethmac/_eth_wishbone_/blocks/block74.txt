Comment: 
This block is responsible for setting up the synchronization of the `ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb2` signal with the `MTxClk` signal and providing a mechanism for resetting it. If a reset signal is detected, the `ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb2` signal is immediately set to 0. Otherwise, it's updated in sync with the `MTxClk` clock signal, mirroring the value of the `ReadTxDataFromFifo_syncb1` signal at each clock cycle.
