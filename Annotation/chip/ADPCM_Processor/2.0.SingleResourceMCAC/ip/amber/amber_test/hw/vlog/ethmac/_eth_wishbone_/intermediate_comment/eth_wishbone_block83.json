    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is for Data Synchronization based on various conditions within a data transmission system. The primary function of the block is data latching during transmission. Whenever a rising edge is detected on MTxClk or Reset, this block responds by reseting the TxDataLatched to zero if Reset is asserted, ensuring it is prepared for the next set of data. If Reset isn't triggered, the block uses a complex conditional statement to perform latching of TxData_wb if the transmission has started, determined by TxStartFrm_sync2, or if TxUsedData and Flop are used while TxByteCnt equals either '3' or '0', therefore preparing the data block for transmission. The #Tp time unit delay is used for simulating propagation times in this system."
