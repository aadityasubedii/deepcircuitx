    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a value to the \"tag_wdata\" based on the value of \"source_sel[C_FILL]\" index. If \"source_sel[C_FILL]\" evaluates to true, the block concatenates a one-bit '1' value with bits from the \"miss_address\" starting from the 31st bit to \"TAG_ADDR32_LSB\". If \"source_sel[C_FILL]\" evaluates to false, then \"tag_wdata\" is assigned with \"TAG_WIDTH\" number of zeros."
