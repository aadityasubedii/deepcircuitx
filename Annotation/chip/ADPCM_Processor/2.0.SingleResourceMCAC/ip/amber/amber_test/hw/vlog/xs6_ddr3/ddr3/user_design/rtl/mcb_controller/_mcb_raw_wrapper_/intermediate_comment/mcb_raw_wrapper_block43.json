    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is responsible for data read and write operations. It assigns data read and write-related signals using the values from different memory controller signals groups, namely mig_p0, mig_p1, mig_p2, mig_p4, mig_p3 and mig_p5. For read operations, received data words are combined together using concatenation to form p0_rd_data. The error and overflow status are inferred from the different micro-interface groups. Write operations also follow a similar pattern where error and underrun statuses are derived from these groups. Here, the interface signals for data flow control (`empty` and `full`) are only considered from mig_p5 group."
