    "block_comment": "This block of code is a data multiplexer that assigns different types of input data to a variable called 'data' according to the provided 'data_mode_i' signal. The 'data' assignment is done within a combinational block that gets triggered whenever there's a change in the input signals (adata, hdata, ndata, w1data, prbs_data, data_mode_i, fixed_data_i). The block utilizes a case statement where different 4-bit patterns for data_mode_i correspond to different data inputs. In case the data_mode_i value doesn't match any provided pattern, default statement is executed assigning zero to 'data'."
