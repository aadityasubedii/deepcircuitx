This block of code performs a timing check function on the 24th bit of the input data vector `dq_in`. The `always @` construct allows the function `dq_timing_check` to be called every time there's a change in the state of `dq_in[23]`. This implementation ensures that any alterations to the specific bit of the data vector are continually monitored for timing issues, promoting accurate functioning of the system.
