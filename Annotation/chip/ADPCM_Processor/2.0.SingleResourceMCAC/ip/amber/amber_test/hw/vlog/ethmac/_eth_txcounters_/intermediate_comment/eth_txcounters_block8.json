    "block_comment": "The block of code predominantly counts a certain quantity, namely \"NibCnt\", and checks whether it meets certain conditions. Firstly, logical AND operations are performed on the 3 and 4 least significant bits of NibCnt to get NibCntEq7 and NibCntEq15 respectively. Then the block checks whether NibCnt is greater or equal than the binary left shift of the (MinFL subtracted by 4) by one minus 1, and the result is assigned to NibbleMinFl. Finally, the block compares the 14 least significant bits of NibCnt to a hexadecimal constant '17B7', and assigns the result to ExcessiveDeferCnt."
