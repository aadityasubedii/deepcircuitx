    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a synchronous error detection and clearing mechanism. Upon every positive edge of the input clock, it checks for a reset or manual error clearing signal. Should these be present, it promptly clears (resets) error and data validity flags for both the data and the printing data queues. Otherwise, it accepts input data as valid and updates the queue error registers accordingly, tallying cumulative errors for the data queue lane."
