    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for invoking the dq_timing_check function whenever there is a change in the 11th bit of the dq_in data queue (Verilog arrays start from 0). Here, the 'always' keyword creates a procedural block that triggers the function call whenever there's a change in the specified condition - in this case, the signal represented by dq_in[10]. This sort of structure is typically used to model timing behavior or create testbenches in hardware simulation."
