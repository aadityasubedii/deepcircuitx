    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for latching the `start_read` signal value at the rising edge of the `i_wb_clk` signal. It is implemented with an always @ (edge event) construct, indicating a set of behavioral statements that execute whenever a specific edge (rising in this case) of a certain signal (`i_wb_clk`) is detected. The statement `start_read_r <= start_read;` will store the current state of the `start_read` signal into `start_read_r` at every positive edge of `i_wb_clk`. `i_wb_clk` is, therefore, a clock signal, and the whole block ensures that `start_read_r` updates correctly with each clock tick."
