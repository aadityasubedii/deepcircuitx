Comment: 
The block of code defines a synchronous process that controls the state of 'cke_train_reg', a training register, based on system conditions. This process is triggered at the positive edge of the user interface clock 'ui_clk' or the internal system reset 'int_sys_rst'. If an internal reset occurs, 'cke_train_reg' is set to zero. On the other hand, it is set to one only when 'wait_200us_done_r1' is true and 'wait_200us_done_r2' is not true, indicating a specific system delay completion status. Otherwise, when the calibration task represented by 'uo_done_cal' is completed, the register is again reset to zero.
