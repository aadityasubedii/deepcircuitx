Comment: 
This block in Verilog is used for conditional instantiation of an output buffer (OBUFT). It enables or disables output based on the condition if the number of data pins (as defined by 'C_NUM_DQ_PINS') equals 16. When the condition holds, an instance named 'iob_udm' of OBUFT buffer type is instantiated. Here 'ioi_udm', 't_udm', and 'mcbx_dram_udm' represents input, 3-state control input, and output of the buffer, respectively.
