This block functions as a sequential data pipeline with delay. It is triggered by the rising edge of the clock signal. Firstly, it reads from the 'wait_bl_end' signal into 'wait_bl_end_r1', and from 'data_i' into 'rd_data_r' using the delay specified by 'TCQ'. Then, it cascades this read data step three times, transferring it into 'rd_data_r2', then 'rd_data_r3', and finally to 'rd_data_r4'. Each transfer incurs a delay of 'TCQ'.
