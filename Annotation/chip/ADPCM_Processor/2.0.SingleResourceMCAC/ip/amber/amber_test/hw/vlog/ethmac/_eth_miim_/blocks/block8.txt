This block is a hardware design developed with Verilog RTL that synchronizes operations based on a clock (Clk) or reset signal (Reset). It initializes or control the flags: 'InProgress' and 'WriteOp'. On a rising edge of the clock or a high reset signal, the system resets both flags to '0'. When no reset signal is present and the Medium-Density Communications (MdcEn) is enabled, operations are initiated (StartOp), assuming no operation is currently in progress (InProgress). The `WriteOp` flag is set with the `WriteDataOp` value. If an operation ends (pushed by 'EndOp') both flags are reset to '0', indicating no operation is in progress or data writing. The system uses non-blocking assignments with propagation delay (#Tp) to simulate real-world conditions in a digital circuit.
