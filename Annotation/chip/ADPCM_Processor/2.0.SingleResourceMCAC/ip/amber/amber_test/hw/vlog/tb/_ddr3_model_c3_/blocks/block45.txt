This block of code runs a timing check function, specifically `dqs_pos_timing_check`, on a falling edge of `dqs_in[20]`. In the context of this code piece, an always block triggers the execution of the `dqs_pos_timing_check(20)` function whenever there's a negative edge transition (from 1 to 0) on the 20th bit of the `dqs_in` input signal.
