    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog code block is used to perform a rotate right (ROR) operation on a 32-bit input. Different branches are evaluated depending on the shift amount, which will either rotate the input by a certain number of bits, or use a carry in. If FULL_BARREL is enabled, the code supports rotations from 0 to 31 bits. In the else branch, a quick rotation is performed which supports rotating by 0 to 3 bits. The selected bits are then concatenated to form the final rotated output. The shifting method depends on the specific values of 'i_shift_amount' and 'i_shift_imm_zero', which guide the data operation."
