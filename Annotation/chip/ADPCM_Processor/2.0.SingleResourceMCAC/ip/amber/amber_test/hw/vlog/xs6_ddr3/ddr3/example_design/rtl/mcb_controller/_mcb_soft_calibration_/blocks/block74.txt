Comment: 
This block of code in the Verilog program controls the register "RST_reg" based on the system clock ("UI_CLK") and a non-violating reset signal ("non_violating_rst"). Whenever there is a positive edge in the system clock or in the "non_violating_rst" signal, the system checks whether "non_violating_rst" is high, or "WAIT_200us_COUNTER[15]" is low; if any of these conditions are true, it assigns a high level ('1') to "RST_reg". If neither condition is true, it assigns the value of "rst_tmp" to "RST_reg". This is an implementation of a synchronous reset, where the reset occurs in synchronization with the system clock.
