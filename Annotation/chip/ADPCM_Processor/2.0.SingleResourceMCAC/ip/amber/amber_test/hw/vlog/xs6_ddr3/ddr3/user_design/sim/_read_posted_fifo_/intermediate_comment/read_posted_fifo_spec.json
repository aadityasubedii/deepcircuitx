    "spec": "Module name: read_posted_fifo. \n\nModule specification: The read_posted_fifo module, parameterized by values for TCQ, FAMILY, MEM_BURST_LEN, ADDR_WIDTH, and the BL_WIDTH, combines inputs and internal signals to manage the operations of a FIFO (First In, First Out) memory system with reading capabilities.\n\nThis module takes in clock and reset signals (clk_i and rst_i, respectively) as inputs to maintain synchronization. Other inputs such as cmd_valid_i, data_valid_i, addr_i, bl_i, cmd_sent, bl_sent, cmd_en_i and gen_rdy_i regulate commands, data address and boundary, user block count checking, and control the readiness of the generator module. Furthermore, inputs such as cmd_valid_i, data_valid_i, cmd_sent, bl_sent, cmd_en_i, relays valuable commands information. These include command and data validity, command sent status and command enabling. \n\nThe module outputs include cmd_rdy_o, gen_valid_o, gen_addr_o, gen_bl_o, rd_buff_avail_o, and rd_mdata_en which represent status signals such as command readiness, generator validity and its address, block boundary, available read buffer size, and enabling the reading of mdata.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes signals like empty_r which is a registered version of the 'empty' signal, rd_first_data, full, empty, wr_en, rd_en, data_valid_r, buf_avail_r, rd_data_received_counts, rd_data_counts_asked to track FIFO states, enable read/write operations, count data received and asked, among other functions.\n\nThe major blocks of the code include timing assignments, always blocks, and the afifo instantiation. The timing assignments control signals that related to data availability and FIFO capacity. The synchronous procedural blocks (always blocks) control the state changes of various signals on each positive edge of the clock or when other conditions are met. Lastly, the afifo instantiation creates a FIFO memory structure with read and write enabling and other signal interactions.\n\nIn summary, the read_posted_fifo module is a memory management module that uses an asynchronous FIFO to handle data incoming from the generator. It carefully regulates read and write operations, checking for buffer room and validity of commands to ensure correct data handling and transfer. It outputs useful command and generator statuses alongside read buffer availability and address boundary for external components to act accordingly.",

Other inputs such as cmd_valid_i, data_valid_i, addr_i, bl_i, cmd_sent, bl_sent, cmd_en_i and gen_rdy_i regulate commands, data address and boundary, user block count checking, and control the readiness of the generator module. Furthermore, inputs such as cmd_valid_i, data_valid_i, cmd_sent, bl_sent, cmd_en_i, relays valuable commands information. These include command and data validity, command sent status and command enabling. \n\nThe module outputs include cmd_rdy_o, gen_valid_o, gen_addr_o, gen_bl_o, rd_buff_avail_o, and rd_mdata_en which represent status signals such as command readiness, generator validity and its address, block boundary, available read buffer size, and enabling the reading of mdata.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes signals like empty_r which is a registered version of the 'empty' signal, rd_first_data, full, empty, wr_en, rd_en, data_valid_r, buf_avail_r, rd_data_received_counts, rd_data_counts_asked to track FIFO states, enable read/write operations, count data received and asked, among other functions.\n\nThe major blocks of the code include timing assignments, always blocks, and the afifo instantiation. The timing assignments control signals that related to data availability and FIFO capacity. The synchronous procedural blocks (always blocks) control the state changes of various signals on each positive edge of the clock or when other conditions are met. Lastly, the afifo instantiation creates a FIFO memory structure with read and write enabling and other signal interactions.\n\nIn summary, the read_posted_fifo module is a memory management module that uses an asynchronous FIFO to handle data incoming from the generator. It carefully regulates read and write operations, checking for buffer room and validity of commands to ensure correct data handling and transfer. It outputs useful command and generator statuses alongside read buffer availability and address boundary for external components to act accordingly."
