    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for timing verification of the signal 'dqs_in[14]' on its negative edge. The implementation is accomplished via the always block that triggers the user-defined function 'dqs_neg_timing_check(14)' whenever there is a negative edge change in signal 'dqs_in[14]'. This function is likely intended to perform further processing or checks related to the specific signal transition event."
