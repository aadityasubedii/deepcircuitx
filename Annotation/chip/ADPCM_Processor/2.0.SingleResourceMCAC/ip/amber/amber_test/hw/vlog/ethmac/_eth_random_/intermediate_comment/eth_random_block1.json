    "block_comment": "This block generates a boolean signal `RandomEqByteCnt` that indicates whether the lower 10 bits of `ByteCnt` equals to `RandomLatched` and if all bits of `NibCnt` are 1. It uses bitwise AND operation (`&`) which checks if all the corresponding bits of both operands are 1. The unary reduction operator `&` applies to `NibCnt[6:0]` checks if all its bits are high. If conditions are satisfied, `RandomEqByteCnt` produces high (1) otherwise it stays low (0)."
