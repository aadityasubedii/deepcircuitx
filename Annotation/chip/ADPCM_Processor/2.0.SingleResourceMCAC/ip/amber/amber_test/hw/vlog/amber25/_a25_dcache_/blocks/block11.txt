Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for the source selection: it assigns the `xSOURCE_SEL` string based on the value of `source_sel` array. The block uses the ternary operator to perform the source selection: it checks each possible value of `source_sel` (`C_CORE`, `C_INIT`, `C_FILL`, `C_INVA`) and assigns the associated string to `xSOURCE_SEL`. If none of these conditions are met, the string `"UNKNOWN"` is assigned to `xSOURCE_SEL`by default.
