Comment: 
This Verilog code block is assigning a write enable signal for a specific tag memory way. The write enable for the ith way `tag_wenable_way[i]` is contingent on the `tag_wenable` signal being high and at least one of the `select_way[i]` or `source_sel[C_INIT]` signals is high. So it works by ANDing the `tag_wenable` signal with the ORed output of `select_way[i]` and `source_sel[C_INIT]`.
