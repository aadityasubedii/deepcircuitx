Comment: 
The block of code monitors changes on the 15th bit (0-indexed) of the `addr_in` input signal. Upon detecting a change, it invokes the `cmd_addr_timing_check()` function with '21' as the input. It achieves this through an `always @` block, a construct in Verilog used for describing event-triggered behavior. This particular block triggers on changes ('@') to the specified bit of the `addr_in` input signal.
