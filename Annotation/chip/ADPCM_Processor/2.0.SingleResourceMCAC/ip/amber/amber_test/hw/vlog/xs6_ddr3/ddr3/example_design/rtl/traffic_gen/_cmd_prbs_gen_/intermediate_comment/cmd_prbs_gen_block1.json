    "block_comment": "This single line Verilog code is a continuous assignment statement. It assigns the current value of the variable 'prbs' to the output wire 'prbs_o'. As a result of this continuous assignment, the two signals always have the same value; if 'prbs' changes, 'prbs_o' will change as well."
