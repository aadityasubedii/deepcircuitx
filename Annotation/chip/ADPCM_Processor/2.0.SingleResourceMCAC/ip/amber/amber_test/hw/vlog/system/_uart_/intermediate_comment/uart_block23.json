    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a transmit First In First Out (FIFO) queue in a serial communication module, specifically handling read and write operations. When the FIFO is enabled, the code checks the fill levels of the FIFO. If FIFO is not full, the data is written into the FIFO and write pointer and FIFO count is incremented. If the FIFO is not empty, the read pointer is incremented, and if the FIFO is not full but empty, the FIFO count is incremented, otherwise, it's decremented. In the else clause when FIFO is not enabled, the write and read pointers, and FIFO count are reset. Data can still be written if the FIFO isn't full, else the FIFO full flag is set to 1, and if FIFO is not empty then the FIFO full flag is reset."
