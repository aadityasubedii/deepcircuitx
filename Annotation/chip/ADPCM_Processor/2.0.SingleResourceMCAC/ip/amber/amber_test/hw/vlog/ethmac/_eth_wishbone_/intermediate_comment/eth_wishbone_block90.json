    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for setting the `TxRetryPacket_NotCleared` flag, which manages the transmission retry mechanism in a write-back cache system. The flag is reset synchronously with either the `WB_CLK_I` clock signal or an explicit `Reset`, ensuring the flag is low-initially. It's further reset on the event of `StartTxBDRead`, which indicates the start of a transmission read-back. Conversely, under certain conditions pertaining to the transaction write-back (`TxRetry_wb`), transaction burst enable state (`tx_burst_en`), master write-back transmission (`MasterWbTX`), master access completion (`MasterAccessFinished`), and retry packet blockage (`TxRetryPacketBlocked`), the flag is set."
