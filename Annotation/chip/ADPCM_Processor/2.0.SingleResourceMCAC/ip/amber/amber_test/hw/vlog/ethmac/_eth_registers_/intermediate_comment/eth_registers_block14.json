    "block_comment": "The block of code is a synchronous reset logic that deasserts a signal (`SetRxCIrq_sync3`) during the falling edge of the Reset. Upon the rising edge of either `Clk` or `Reset`, if Reset is active (high), `SetRxCIrq_sync3` is set to 0, effectively resetting the signal. Otherwise, it passes the value of `SetRxCIrq_sync2` along a pipeline stage, sequencing the signal through the design with a clock period delay specified by `#Tp`."
