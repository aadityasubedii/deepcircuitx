    "block_comment": "The block of code dynamically generates an OBUFT instance 'iob_udm' when the number of data pins, denoted by the constant 'C_NUM_DQ_PINS', equals 16. The OBUFT is a type of output buffer used in the Verilog hardware description language to manage output signals. In this particular instance, the .I, .T and .O terminals of the OBUFT instance are connected to 'ioi_udm', 't_udm', and 'mcbx_dram_udm', respectively."
