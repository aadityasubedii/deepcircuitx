    "block_comment": "The block is a conditional branch within a larger block that comes into play when the variable 'WAYS' is equal to four. It works by assigning the return value of the function called 'pick_way' to the variable 'next_way'. The 'pick_way' function receives 'valid_bits_r' representing the valid bits from register and 'random_num' as arguments, which are likely used to determine the 'next_way' based on the validity of bits in register and a random number."
