    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the update of the `iaddress`. It does so by using an OR operation on two conditions: whether the write enable signal for the program counter data memory (`pc_dmem_wen`) is activated or a logical operation where both core stall (`i_core_stall`) and conflict (`i_conflict`) signals are deactivated. Both these conditions contribute to directing an update in the `iaddress`."
