    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is conditionally enabled when 'C_S4_AXI_ENABLE' is zero, contained within the process block 'P4_UI_MCB'. It maps a host of internal variables to their associated input counterparts, facilitating the control and operation of a Microcontroller Bus (MCB) system. Specifically, it handles command clock, data writing, and data reading tasks, including command instruction, byte addressing and block length properties for command, clock, enable signal, mask, data, and status checks for write operations, and similar control and checks for read operations. Any errors, overflows, or underruns that occur during read and write processes are also acknowledged."
