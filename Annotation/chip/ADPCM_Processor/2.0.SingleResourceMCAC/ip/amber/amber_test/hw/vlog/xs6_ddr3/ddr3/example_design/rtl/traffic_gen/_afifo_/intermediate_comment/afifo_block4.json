    "block_comment": "This block of code adheres to a standard for generating the next Gray code word given a binary number. It does this by performing a bit-wise XOR operation on adjacent bits of the write pointer `wr_ptr`. The most significant bit is copied directly and for remaining less significant bits, it performs an XOR between the current bit and the next most significant bit. This bit-wise operation ensures the generation of a valid Gray code from a given binary input."
