    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic block that controls flip-flop \"Flop\" based on certain conditions. On the rising edge of the MTxClk or Reset, operations within this block are evaluated. If Reset is high, the flop is reset to zero with propagation delay 'Tp'. Otherwise, if TxDone, TxAbort, or TxRetry_q is high, the same action happens. However, if TxUsedData is high, flop is toggled (inverted), also with propagation delay 'Tp'."
