Comment: 
This block is responsible for assigning the least significant 32 bits of the 'rot_prod' to the 'p_l' signal. Its function is accomplished by utilizing the in-built 'assign' keyword, which in Verilog allows continuous assignment of declared ports and nets. The selection of bits is specified by '[31:0]', indicating that 'p_l' will hold the 32 lower bits of 'rot_prod' value.
