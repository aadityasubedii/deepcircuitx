    "block_comment": "This block is a reset pulse width violation check module in Verilog. It triggers on the rising edge of the input signal `rst_n_in`. If the simulation time is above 100000 units, it checks whether the next desired reset location (`tm_rst_n + 100000`) is still within the current simulation time. If this is not the case, it flags an error using `$display` to provide the information about the instance (`%m`), current time (`%t`), and how much the error exceeded the allowed pulse width. The `tm_rst_n` is updated with the current simulation time `$time` after each check."
