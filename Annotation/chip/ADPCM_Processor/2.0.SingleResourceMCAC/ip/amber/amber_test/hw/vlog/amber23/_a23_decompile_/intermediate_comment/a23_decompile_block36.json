    "block_comment": "This block of code handles synchronous updates of instruction execution information on the rising edge of the input clock (`i_clk`). If the instruction is valid (`i_instruction_valid`) and there are no fetch stalls (`!i_fetch_stall`), the block transfers the instruction, its address, whether it's undefined or not (`i_instruction_undefined`), and a flag to denote current execution (`execute_now`) from the input registers to the execution registers. This is pursued by assigning input register values (denoted with 'i_' prefix) to their corresponding execute-level registers (denoted with 'execute_' prefix).\n"
