    "block_comment": "The block generates walking patterns to test signaling on a 32 pin Data signal interface (DQ). It follows a condition based on the number of DQ_PINS and the type of DATA_PATTERN. The supported patterns include \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\", and \"DGEN_ALL\", which are most likely used to check for edge cases or specific data conditions. The generation is clocked on the positive edge of an input clock signal, implying a synchronous operation."
