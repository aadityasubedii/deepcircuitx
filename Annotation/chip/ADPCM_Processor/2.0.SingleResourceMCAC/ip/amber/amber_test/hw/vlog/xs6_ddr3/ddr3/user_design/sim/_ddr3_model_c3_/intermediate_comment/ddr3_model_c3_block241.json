    "block_comment": "The code block essentially creates a delayed version of the \"write enable\" signal (`we_n`), utilizing an always block for this function in Verilog RTL design. The delay is determined by the `BUS_DELAY` parameter. Specifically, whenever the write enable signal (`we_n`) changes, this always block becomes activated. Consequently, an updated value for `we_n_in` is scheduled to take effect after a delay period measured by `BUS_DELAY` units of time."
