    "block_comment": "This block of code represents the instantiation of an Ethernet Transmit Control (eth_transmitcontrol) module. This module's purpose is to manage the control flow of transmitted frames over an Ethernet link. It takes clock and reset input signals, along with various control signals including frame start, frame end, pause request, and control frame details. It also outputs signals indicating whether it's currently sending a control frame, whether it's blocking transmissions, and other information. Furthermore, it handles the detection of used data output, flow control, delayed CRC enablement, and pause time value. The MAC address is also inputted into this module. It effectively administers the transmission of Ethernet frames in accordance with the provided control parameters."
