Comment: 
This block manages the condition for enabling the reception, RxEn_needed, in a synchronous design. On each rising edge of WB_CLK_I clock or a reset signal, the block checks a series of conditions: If a reset is triggered, RxEn_needed is directly set to 0. If the system is not reset, and there is no Receive ready, along with an enabled Rx and previous state of WbEn being off, it sets RxEn_needed to 1. Lastly, it ensures that if a read-pointer operation is going on along with RxEn and previous state of RxEn being on, then RxEn_needed is made 0. Thus, it seems to be managing whether the reception is required based on various conditions.
