    "block_comment": "The block of code serves to implement an output buffer for clock enable (CKE) signal for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) using a Xilinx-specific primitive, OBUFT. This OBUFT has three operational ports: output (.O), input (.I), and tristate control (.T). The input signal (ioi_cke) to the buffer is routed to the output (mcbx_dram_cke) under the control of the tristate control signal (t_cke). When the tristate control (t_cke) is '0', the output follows the input; but on '1', the output goes into high impedance state, effectively isolating CKE signal for the MCB."
