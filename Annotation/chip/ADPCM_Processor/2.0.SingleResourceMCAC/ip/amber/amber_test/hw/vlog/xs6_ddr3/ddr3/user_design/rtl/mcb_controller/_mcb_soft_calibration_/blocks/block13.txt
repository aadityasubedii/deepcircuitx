This block of code is used to control the self-refresh request (SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ) of a Memory Controller Block (MCB). When there is a reset signal (RST), the self-refresh request is deactivated. If the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) is locked and there's no self-refresh request, the self-refresh MCB request is also kept deactivated. However, if the current state is START_DYN_CAL and there is a self-refresh request, then the self-refresh MCB request is activated. This functionality seems to be a part of a dynamic calibration operation on the MCB.
