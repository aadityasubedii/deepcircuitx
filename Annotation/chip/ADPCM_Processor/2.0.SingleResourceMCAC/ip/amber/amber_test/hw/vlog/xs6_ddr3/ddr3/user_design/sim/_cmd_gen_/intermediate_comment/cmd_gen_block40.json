    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for resetting and incrementing read data received counts on given conditions. When the `rst_i[0]` signal is high (during positive edge of the clock), it resets both `rd_data_received_counts` and `rd_data_received_counts_total` variables to 'b0. However, whenever `reading_rd_data_i` signal is high, indicating that the system is in the state where it's reading received data, both `rd_data_received_counts` and `rd_data_received_counts_total` get incremented by one. All these variable updates should be queued until the defined delay time (`#TCQ`) passes."
