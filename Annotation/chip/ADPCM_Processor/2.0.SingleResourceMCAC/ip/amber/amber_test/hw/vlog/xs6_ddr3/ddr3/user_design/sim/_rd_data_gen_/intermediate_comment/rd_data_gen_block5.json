    "block_comment": "This block of code selects the state of the 'cmd_rdy' signal, based on certain conditions, in every rising edge of the 'clk_i' signal. If the 'rst_i[0]' signal is high, the 'cmd_rdy' is set to 1 after a delay of TCQ time units. On the other hand, if 'cmd_start' is activated, 'cmd_rdy' is set to 0 after a delay of TCQ. Lastly, if none of the previous conditions are true, and 'data_port_fifo_rdy' is active plus user_burst_cnt equals 1, the 'cmd_rdy' is set to 1 again after the same delay of TCQ time units."
