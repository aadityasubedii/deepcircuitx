This Verilog block functions to generate data based on the given input address and data mode. It first evaluates the state of clk_i signal. When positive edge of it (posedge) is detected, for each address range and data_mode selection, it calls either Data_Gen or Data_GenW0 function to generate the data. The generated data is assigned to w1data with a delay defined by TCQ. If the address doesn't fall into any conditions, it defaults to assigning zero to the first quarter of w1data. If MEM_BURST_LEN equals to 8, data shifting operations are executed on w1data. The shifting operations maintain the order, but essentially re-distribute the data across the quarter sections of the w1data bus array.
