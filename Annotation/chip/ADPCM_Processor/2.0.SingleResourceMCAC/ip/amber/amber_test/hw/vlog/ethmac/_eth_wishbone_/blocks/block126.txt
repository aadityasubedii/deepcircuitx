Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for asynchronously controlling the `BlockingIncrementTxPointer` register on every rising edge of `WB_CLK_I` (WriteBack Clock) signal or `Reset` signal. If the `Reset` signal or `MasterAccessFinished` signal is high, the `BlockingIncrementTxPointer` register is reset to zero immediately. If neither of those conditions is satiated and `IncrTxPointer` signal is high, it results in incrementing the `BlockingIncrementTxPointer` value by '1'.
