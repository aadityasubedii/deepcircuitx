    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a specific hardware behaviour under the condition of 'C_PORT_CONFIG' being equal to 'B64_B32_B32'. Given the label 'u_config_3', this block then likely implements unique functionality related to the 64-32-32 configuration of the C_PORT. Additional code within this block would specify the detailed operation, which might include assignment statements, bitwise operations, conditional structures among others tailored for this particular configuration 'B64_B32_B32'.\n"
