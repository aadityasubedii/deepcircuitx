    "block_comment": "This block of code is a timing check task in Verilog that examines and displays timing errors relating to input signal 'i'. It uses several conditional statements to verify compliance with timing conditions (tIH and tIPW) associated with the signal 'i'. If a violation is spotted, an error message is generated which indicates the exact timing error and the degree of violation. In case of no timing violations, the task simply updates the timing of the command address pertaining to that particular input signal."
