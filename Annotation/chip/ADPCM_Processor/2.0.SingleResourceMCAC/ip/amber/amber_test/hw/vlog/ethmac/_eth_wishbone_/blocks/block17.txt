This Verilog code block assigns various received signal status flags to the RxStatusIn signal. The signal statuses encompass various fault and notification conditions such as: ReceivedPauseFrm, AddressMiss, RxOverrun, InvalidSymbol, DribbleNibble, ReceivedPacketTooBig, ShortFrame, LatchedCrcError, and RxLateCollision. These conditions are monitored during the operation of a receiving data path in a communication system and are aggregated into a single status vector for further processing or fault detection.
