    "block_comment": "This block of code is deployed to check and handle invalid command errors for port 4 when it is in 'read only' mode. It constantly monitors the status of various signals and commands related to port 4, utilizing an 'always @(*)' block for this purpose. If it detects an enabled command ('p4_cmd_en' is 1) on port 4 and the port is configured for read operations ('C_PORT_CONFIG[55:32]' equals to \"R32\"), while the command instruction is invalid for a read-only port ('p4_cmd_instr[2]' equals to 0 and 'p4_cmd_instr[0]' equals to 0), then it reports an error message and ends the operation to mitigate any potential issues arising from invalid commands."
