This block of code defines a task that translates a given `mtrans_itype` into its corresponding string representation and writes it into a file named `decompile_file`.[Function of the block]. The implementation is achieved by using a case statement which first checks for `mtrans_itype` and according to its value (4'h0, 4'h1, 4'h2, 4'h3) writes a corresponding string ('da', 'ia', 'db', 'ib') to the file `decompile_file`. In case none of the conditions match, it writes string 'xx' as default [Implementation details of the block].
