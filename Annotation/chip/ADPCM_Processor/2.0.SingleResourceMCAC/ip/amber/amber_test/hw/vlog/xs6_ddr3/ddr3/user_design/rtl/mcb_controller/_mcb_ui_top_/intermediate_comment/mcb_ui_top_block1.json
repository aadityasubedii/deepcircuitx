For instance, if we had below code:\n\n```verilog\nmodule Adder(A, B, Sum);  \n  input A, B; \n  output Sum;\n  assign Sum = A + B; \nendmodule\n```\n\nA potential comment could be: \nThis code defines an adder module. The adder has two inputs, A and B, and one output, Sum. The value of Sum is generated by using an assign statement, which adds the values of A and B together.\n"
