Comment: 
The block of code is monitoring a specific bit (bit 5) of the array 'dq_in' and whenever this particular bit changes, it triggers the function 'dq_timing_check'. The function is defined elsewhere and can be reviewed for specifics of its operation, however, the purpose of calling this function in relation to bit 5 of dq_in suggests it performs some data integrity or timing validation relevant to the state or transition of this bit.
