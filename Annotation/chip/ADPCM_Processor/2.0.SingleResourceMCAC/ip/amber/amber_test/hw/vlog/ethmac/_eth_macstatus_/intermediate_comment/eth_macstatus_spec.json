    "spec": "Module Name: eth_macstatus\n\nModule Specification: The eth_macstatus module provides functionality for managing the status operations of an Ethernet Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. It processes a multitude of input signals from various components of the MAC layer, including those regarding receive and transmission states, collision detections, carrier sensing, frame length, and more. The module uses these inputs to update and output various status signals covering conditions such as CRC error status, end of reception, packet validity and retry count among others.\n\nInput Ports: The module has a wide collection of input ports including MRxClk and MTxClk (receive and transmit clock signals), Reset (initialization signal), and numerous error and status signals like RxCrcError, MRxErr, MRxDV, Loopback, CarrierSense and more. These inputs help in understanding the details about the packet transmission or reception process required to determine the status flags to set.\n\nOutput Ports: The output ports of this module are status flags like ReceivedLengthOK, ReceiveEnd, ReceivedPacketGood, InvalidSymbol, RetryCntLatched etc. These status flags provide critical input to other components about the status of packet transmission/reception and any issues detected in this process.\n\nInternal Signals: The eth_macstatus module uses multiple internal signals, most importantly for sampling, error detection and status control. We have TakeSample (determines when to sample), SetInvalidSymbol (flag for encountering invalid symbol during reception), ReceiveEnd (indicates end of a received data packet), RetryCntLatched (holds retry count till transmission end) among others.\n\nCode Blocks and Functions: The module's Verilog code contains multiple blocks mainly consisting of always blocks and assign statements. The always blocks are used for handling clocked operations and include processes for init/reset, sampling of data, setting and resetting various status flags based on certain conditions. The assign statements are implemented for direct assignments and are not clock dependent. They mainly deal with routing the input and output ports and determining values of system signals based on various input conditions.",

LatchedCrcError: It is a latched signal that stores the CRC error status of the received data.\n5. LatchedMRxErr: This is the reg signal that holds errors during the receiving state.  \n6. LoadRxStatus: This signal is used to synchronize when we take a sample of the receive status.\n7. InvalidSymbol: This reg indicates if an invalid symbol was encountered during reception.\n8. RetryCntLatched: This stores the retry count till the end of a reception or transmission.\n9. RetryLimit: This signal is used to store if the maximum collision limit is reached during transmission.\n10. LateCollLatched: This signal stores if late collision occurred during transmission.\n11. DeferLatched: A latch signal used to hold the DeferIndication signal value.\n12. CarrierSenseLost: Signal that holds the state of carrier sense loss during transmission.\n13. RxLateCollision: This signal indicates a late collision event in reception.\n14. RxColWindow: This signal is related to managing the collision window during reception.\n15. ShortFrame: This indicates if a received frame is shorter than the minimum length.\n16. DribbleNibble: This signal indicates the presence of an extra half-byte in the received packet.\n17. ReceivedPacketTooBig: This signal indicates if a received packet is above the maximum length."

                    "text": "Module Name: eth_macstatus\n\nModule Specification: The eth_macstatus module provides functionality for managing the status operations of an Ethernet Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. It processes a multitude of input signals from various components of the MAC layer, including those regarding receive and transmission states, collision detections, carrier sensing, frame length, and more. The module uses these inputs to update and output various status signals covering conditions such as CRC error status, end of reception, packet validity and retry count among others.\n\nInput Ports: The module has a wide collection of input ports including MRxClk and MTxClk (receive and transmit clock signals), Reset (initialization signal), and numerous error and status signals like RxCrcError, MRxErr, MRxDV, Loopback, CarrierSense and more. These inputs help in understanding the details about the packet transmission or reception process required to determine the status flags to set.\n\nOutput Ports: The output ports of this module are status flags like ReceivedLengthOK, ReceiveEnd, ReceivedPacketGood, InvalidSymbol, RetryCntLatched etc. These status flags provide critical input to other components about the status of packet transmission/reception and any issues detected in this process.\n\nInternal Signals: The eth_macstatus module uses multiple internal signals, most importantly for sampling, error detection and status control. We have TakeSample (determines when to sample), SetInvalidSymbol (flag for encountering invalid symbol during reception), ReceiveEnd (indicates end of a received data packet), RetryCntLatched (holds retry count till transmission end) among others.\n\nCode Blocks and Functions: The module's Verilog code contains multiple blocks mainly consisting of always blocks and assign statements. The always blocks are used for handling clocked operations and include processes for init/reset, sampling of data, setting and resetting various status flags based on certain conditions. The assign statements are implemented for direct assignments and are not clock dependent. They mainly deal with routing the input and output ports and determining values of system signals based on various input conditions."
