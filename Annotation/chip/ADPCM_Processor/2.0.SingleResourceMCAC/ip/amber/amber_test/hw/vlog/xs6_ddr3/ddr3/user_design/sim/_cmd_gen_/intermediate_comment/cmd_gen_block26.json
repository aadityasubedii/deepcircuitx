    "block_comment": "This block is used to calculate the end address of a data bus transaction. On every rising edge of the input clock (clk_i), the net 'end_addr_r' is assigned a new value after a delay of #TCQ time units, which is computed by subtracting a value (equal to the relative bus width divided by 8, multiplied by the input variable 'fixed_bl_i') from the input end address ('end_addr_i'). After subtraction, it then increments the result by 1 for aligning correctly."
