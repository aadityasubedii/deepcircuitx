This block of code ensures synchronized reset for transmitting circular interrupt. Implementing an edge-triggered methodology, this block relies on the clock (TxClk) or Reset signal. In case of a Reset signal, 'ResetTxCIrq_sync1' is reset, otherwise, it adopts the value of 'SetTxCIrq_sync2'. The delay constant, 'Tp', is used in both conditions for timing management.
