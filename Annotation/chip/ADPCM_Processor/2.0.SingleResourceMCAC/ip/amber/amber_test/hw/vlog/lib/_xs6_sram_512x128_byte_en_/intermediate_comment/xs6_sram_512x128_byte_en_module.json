    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a 512x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using four Xilinx Spartan-6 RAMB16BWER primitives. It provides 128-bit read/write operations with 9-bit addressing and 16-bit byte-enable control. The module supports initial memory content configuration through parameters and ensures synchronous read/write operations with the input clock."
