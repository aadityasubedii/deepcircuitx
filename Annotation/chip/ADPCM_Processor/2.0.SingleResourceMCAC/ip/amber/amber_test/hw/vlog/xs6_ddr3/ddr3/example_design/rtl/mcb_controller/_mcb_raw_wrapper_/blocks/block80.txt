This block handles address mapping for different memory configurations. The function of the block is to map command byte addresses to row address (ra), bank address (ba), and column address (ca) for multiple ports (p0 to p5) based on memory parameters. The implementation details include:

1. Conditional logic based on the number of DQ pins (16, 8, or 4) and memory address order.
2. Bit slicing and concatenation to extract appropriate address bits for ra, ba, and ca.
3. Padding with zeros when necessary to match required bit widths.
4. Handling different memory configurations (address widths, bank address widths, and column bits).
5. Separate address mapping for each port (p0 to p5) to support multi-port configurations.
