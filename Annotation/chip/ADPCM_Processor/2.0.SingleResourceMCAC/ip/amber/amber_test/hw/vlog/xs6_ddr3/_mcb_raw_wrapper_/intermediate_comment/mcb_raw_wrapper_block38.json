    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a 200-microsecond wait counter in a digital system. Triggered by the rising edge of the ui_clk signal or the initialization signal int_sys_rst, the counter starts counting from zero if int_sys_rst is high. However, when not at reset, it checks if the 16th bit (array index 15) of the counter is high; if it is, the counter holds its current value, effectively limiting it to a maximum of 32768 counts. Otherwise, the counter increments by one on every clock cycle."
