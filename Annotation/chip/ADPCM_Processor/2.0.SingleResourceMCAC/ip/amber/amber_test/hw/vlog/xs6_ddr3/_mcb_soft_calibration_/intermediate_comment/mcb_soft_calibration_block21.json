    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code is a state machine that determines the next state based on flags and conditions. In the WAIT8 state, it checks the negative of IODRPCTRLR_RDY_BUSY_N flag. If the flag is '0' indicating the device is not ready or busy, the state remains WAIT8. If the flag is '1,' indicating the device is ready and not busy, it checks another flag, First_In_Term_Done. If this second flag is set, it transitions to the START_DYN_CAL state, otherwise it moves to the WRITE_CALIBRATE state. The RST_DELAY state is ready to reset the block when the Block_Reset flag is set."
