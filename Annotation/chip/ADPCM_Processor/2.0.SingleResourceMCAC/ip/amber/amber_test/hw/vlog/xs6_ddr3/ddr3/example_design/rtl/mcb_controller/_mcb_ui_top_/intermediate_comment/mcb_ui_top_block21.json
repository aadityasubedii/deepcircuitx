    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code generates the connections to a memory controller block (mcb) for AXI interface under specific conditions. If the AXI interface is disabled (C_S1_AXI_ENABLE == 0), it simply assigns local signals directly to their interface counterparts, creating a 1:1 mapping without any logic transformation. If the AXI interface is enabled, it first masks the AXI address with the provided mask value (P_S1_AXI_ADDRMASK) and creates a synchronous signal, \"calib_done_synch\" through \"mcb_ui_top_synch\" instance. It then defines and instantiates the \"axi_mcb\" module, providing a map for AXI bus signals to and from the MCB module. This module presumably connects the system's main AXI bus to the actual MCB. Various AXI protocol signals for write, read, address and other parameters are mapped accordingly."
