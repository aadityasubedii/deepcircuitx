The block executes an 8-way read operation on a cache line. It works by checking each of the eight data_hit_way signals in sequence, and assigns the corresponding data_rdata_way when a hit is detected. If no hit is found on any of the ways, a default value {CACHE_LINE_WIDTH{1'd1}} is assigned to the hit_rdata. This is essentially an 8-way associative cache read operation utilizing a priority encoder pattern for hit detection.
