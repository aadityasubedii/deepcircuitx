    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a shift register setup. When there is a positive edge trigger on the DRP_CLK (clock) signal, the system checks if the sync_rst (synchronous reset) is enabled. If so, the shift register (shift_through_reg) is reset to zero. Otherwise, the system checks the load_shift_n signal - if it is high, the data_out_mux (data output from a Multiplexer) is loaded into the shift register. If it is low, the data is shifted one bit to the right, and the leftmost bit (most significant bit) is replaced by the output from the DRP_SDO. This shift operation effectively implements a serial data input functionality with the ability to reset or load new data dynamically."
