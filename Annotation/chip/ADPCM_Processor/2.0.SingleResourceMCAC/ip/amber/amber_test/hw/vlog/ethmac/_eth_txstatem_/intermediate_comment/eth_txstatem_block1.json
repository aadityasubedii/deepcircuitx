    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a rule-based system in a synchronous manner. The rule, Rule1, is updated at the positive edge of the MTxClk or a Reset signal. On reset, Rule1 is set to 0 with a propagation delay defined by Tp. When the system is in StateIdle or StateBackOff, Rule1 is also set to 0. However, if the system is in the StatePreamble state or when the FullD state is active, Rule1 is set to 1."
