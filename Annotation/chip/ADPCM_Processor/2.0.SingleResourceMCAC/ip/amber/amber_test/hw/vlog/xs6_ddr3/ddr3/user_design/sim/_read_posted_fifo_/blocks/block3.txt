Comment: 
This block updates the status of a register to reflect whether it's empty or not. On every rising edge of the input clock (clk_i), the register `empty_r` is asynchronously updated with the delay defined by the time constant queue `#TCQ`. This reflects the current status of the `empty` signal. The delay is implemented to avoid hold time violations and to ensure proper timing of operations.
