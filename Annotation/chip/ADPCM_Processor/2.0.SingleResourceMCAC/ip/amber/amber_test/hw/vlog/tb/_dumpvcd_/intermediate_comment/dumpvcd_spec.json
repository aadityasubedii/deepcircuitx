    "spec": "Module name: dumpvcd. \n\nModule specification: The module dumpvcd is essentially a diagnostic tool used in the simulation stage of hardware design. Its primary function is to generate a Value Change Dump (VCD) file that captures the changes in values of key signals within the design across specific periods of time, useful for post-simulation analysis, debugging, and verification. Essentially, this module acts as an observatory window into the design's working during simulation. Confusingly, the module does not possess any traditional Verilog input or output ports. Despite this, it extensively interacts with components of the design via globally defined flags and identifiers. The module encapsulates several internal signals or identifiers, such as the `AMBER_DUMP_VCD`, `AMBER_DUMP_START`, `AMBER_DUMP_LENGTH`, and `AMBER_VCD_FILE`, which control the onset, duration, and destination of the dump respectively. The identifiers `U_TB.clk_count`, `U_DECOMPILE.xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE` and `U_EXECUTE` reference the clock cycle count in the test-bench (TB) and signals of the U_EXECUTE unit in another module, allowing tracing of their activity. The main sections of code in this module are the initial block that sets up the VCD dump by defining its parameters, and the always block that toggles the dump on and off based on clock count conditions, and optionally, terminating the test after the dump session. The module is only active when the conditional compilation flag 'AMBER_DUMP_VCD' is defined.",

Internal signals: `AMBER_DUMP_VCD`, `AMBER_DUMP_START`, `AMBER_DUMP_LENGTH`, `AMBER_VCD_FILE`, `U_TB.clk_count`, `U_DECOMPILE.xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE`, `U_EXECUTE`, and `U_DECOMPILE.i_clk`.\n   \n2. Explanation: \n\n   - `AMBER_DUMP_VCD`: This is a conditional compilation flag used to enable or disable the VCD dump code. The code inside `ifdef AMBER_DUMP_VCD` will only be included if this flag is defined.\n   \n   - `AMBER_DUMP_START`: This flag sets the starting point for dumping in clock cycle count, used to control when the dump process starts.\n   \n   - `AMBER_DUMP_LENGTH`: This flag sets the total length for which the dumping should happen in clock cycle count.\n   \n   - `AMBER_VCD_FILE`: This flag defines the name of the file where the dumped information will be stored.\n   \n   - `U_TB.clk_count`: This represents the 'clock count' in the testbench (TB) module used for syncing the dumping process with the clock cycle.\n   \n   - `U_DECOMPILE.xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE`, `U_EXECUTE`: These are signals of the `U_EXECUTE` unit which execute the instructions. They are dumped to get information about the execution process.\n   \n   - `U_DECOMPILE.i_clk`: This is the internal clock signal for the decompile module. The `always` block inside this module is sensitive to the positive edge of this clock that leads to its activation for Dump On and Dump Off depending on the clock count.\n\nHere, it's important to mention that these are not classical Verilog signals (wires or registers), but identifiers from an include file (\"global_defines.vh\") or hardcoded names of signals from other modules. They're used in the module in order to write to the VCD file for tracking changes in specific places in the rest of the design."
