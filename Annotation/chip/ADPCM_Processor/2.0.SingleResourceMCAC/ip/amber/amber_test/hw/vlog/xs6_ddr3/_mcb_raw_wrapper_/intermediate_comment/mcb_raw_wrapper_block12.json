    "block_comment": "The block of code is defining an output buffer 'OBUFT' with the name 'iob_ras'. The main function of this block is to control the output of the 'mcbx_dram_ras_n' signal based on the inputs 'ioi_ras' and 't_ras'. Specifically, 'ioi_ras' is the input data signal and 't_ras' is the output enable signal. If the 't_ras' enable signal is active, then the state of the 'mcbx_dram_ras_n' output will be defined by the value of 'ioi_ras'. If the enable signal is not active, the output will be in a high impedance state (Z), effectively disconnecting it from the circuit."
