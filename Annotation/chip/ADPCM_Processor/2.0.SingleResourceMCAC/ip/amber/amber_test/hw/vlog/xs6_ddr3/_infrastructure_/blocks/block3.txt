The block of code generates a reset signal. This is achieved by employing an 'assign' statement, which is responsible for assigning a new signal (rst_tmp) as the logical OR between the system reset (sys_rst) and the inverse of a clock signal's power up PLL lock status (syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked).
