Comment: 
The block of code primarily serves as a state machine controlling the `AddressPhase` signal based on system state and bit count. This signal is reset when `sync_rst` is high, indicating a synchronous reset sequence. In the absence of reset, two conditions determine `AddressPhase`. It remains low when the system state equals `ALMOST_READY2`. If the state is `ADDR_PHASE` and `bit_cnt` equals '111', it turns high. The `AddressPhase` will transition between these states on rising edges of `DRP_CLK`, serving as the clock signal.
