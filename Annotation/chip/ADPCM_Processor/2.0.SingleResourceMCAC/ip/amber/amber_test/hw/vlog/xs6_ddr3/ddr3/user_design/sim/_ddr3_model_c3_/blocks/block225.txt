The function `open_bank_file` is responsible for generating a filename based on `tmp_model_dir` and `bank`, and then opens that file for both reading and writing. The file reference is returned if the opening is successful. The filename is formed using the `$sformat` system function, and the `$fopen` system function is used to open the file. In case of a failure, an error message is displayed and the simulation is halted with `$finish`. Moreover, if the debug mode (`DEBUG`) is on, an informational message is displayed.
