Comment: 
This block assigns a new value to `next_way` based on the current state of `valid_bits_r` and `random_num`. If the `WAYS` value is equal to 3, then the `next_way` computation is enabled. This is implemented using a conditional construct (`if`) in Verilog and the computation of `next_way` is achieved by calling the `pick_way` function, passing `valid_bits_r` and `random_num` as arguments to it.
