    "block_comment": "This block defines and generates a set of OSERDES2 modules, used for data serialization. In this block, a for-loop is used to initialize the parameterized module for all data-quantity lines. The OSERDES2 block is configured with constants for bypassing the GCLK_FF, output mode, data rate, and other parameters. Data is taken from the dqo_p (positive) and dqo_n (negative) lines, and serialized outputs are directed to dq_oq and dq_tq, respectively. The whole block is controlled by the ioclk90 clock line, with synchronous reset provided by the int_sys_rst signal. The instance OSERDES2 also features a built-in training pattern, activated by ioi_drp_train."
