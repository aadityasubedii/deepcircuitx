    "block_comment": "This block of code controls a decision mechanism for the type of input/output buffer (IOBUF or IOBUFDS) to be generated, based on memory types and the number of data-query pins. If the memory type is DDR, MDDR or DDR2 without differential DQS, and the DQ pins count is 16, it generates an IOBUF with signals connected to the relevant ports. However, if the condition for memory types doesn't fit but the DQ pins count is still 16, then it generates an IOBUFDS buffer instead and connects the signals to respective ports including an additional port for DQS signal."
