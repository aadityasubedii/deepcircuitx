    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a read/write FIFO (First-In, First-Out) memory in Verilog. The provided block is instantiated with a number of input/output signals. It utilizes a common clock signal (`clk_i`) for both read and write operations. The write operations are controlled by `wr_en` (write enable) signal and `wr_data` (write data) that combines the block (`bl_i`) and address (`addr_i`) inputs. The read operations are controlled by `rd_en` (read enable) signal and `rd_data` (read data) that separates the fetched data into `gen_bl_o` and `gen_addr_o`. The fullness and emptiness of the FIFO are tracked by `full` and `empty` signals respectively. The `almost_full` signal is unused."
