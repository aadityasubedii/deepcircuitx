    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates the dynamic calibration process in a system. Specifically, it resets crucial control signals such as 'Pre_SYSRST', 'counter_inc', and 'counter_dec' to ensure correct operation. Then, it checks if both 'SKIP_DYNAMIC_DQS_CAL' and 'SKIP_DYN_IN_TERMINATION' flags are enabled. If they are, the state machine transitions to the 'DONE' state, effectively skipping the dynamic calibration phase."
