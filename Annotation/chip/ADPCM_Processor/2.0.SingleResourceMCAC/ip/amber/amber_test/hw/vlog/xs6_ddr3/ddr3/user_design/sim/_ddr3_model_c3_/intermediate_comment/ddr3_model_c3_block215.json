    "block_comment": "This block of code declares parameters used in identifying the types of memory accesses in a Verilog design. The parameters include `SAME_BANK`, `DIFF_BANK` and `DIFF_GROUP`, each assigned with a 2-bit decimal value (2'd0, 2'd1, and 2'd2 respectively) to represent different memory access configurations for optimizing memory operations in the hardware design."
