    "block_comment": "This block is a generator for shift-left logic in hardware. There are two modes available: immediate-zero mode and shift-by-amount mode. When immediate-zero mode is activated (i_shift_imm_zero == 1) or the shift amount (i_shift_amount) is 0, the input (i_in) is passed through without any shift, with i_carry_in appended on the MSB side. If in shift-by-amount mode, the input bitstream is shifted to the left by the number specified by i_shift_amount while preserving the original MSB of the input bitstream and appending zeros to its LSB. The generator has two available implementations: \"full_lsl\" which supports shift amounts from 0 to 32, and \"quick_lsl\" which is optimized for smaller shift amounts from 0 to 3."
