This ICache is parameterized with a certain number of cache lines, cache words per line and ways of associativity, which is indicated by the parameters at the beginning of the module definition. As a cache, its function is to provide faster access to instructions by storing a copy of data from frequently used main memory locations. It uses both read and write operations for this. The functions of different states, including initialization, filling, idle and others, are defined in this module. Checks are incorporated to prevent more than one hit in the cache ways. Data for the cache is stored in SRAMs - either Spartan 6 FPGA SRAM, Virtex-6 FPGA SRAM, or generic SRAM. Finally, it includes error checking conditions for unsupported number of ways. Additionally, the module includes a variety of debugging and testing capabilities."

All major synchronous operations in the module are carried out based on this clock cycle.\n- reset: This is a reset signal to the module. It is used to initialize the ICache to a known state during startup or when a reset event occurs.\n- scan_enable, test_mode: These inputs are used for test mode operations.\n- i_core_stall: This input signal is used to indicate when the core processor is stalled. \n- i_select, i_cache_enable, i_cache_flush: These input signals are used for selecting, enabling and flushing the cache respectively.\n- i_address, i_address_nxt: These inputs serve as the current and next instruction address for fetching from the icache.\n- i_wb_read_data, i_wb_ready: These are inputs for the write back read data and ready signal.\n\n2.
