    "block_comment": "[Function of the block] This line of Verilog code assigns a new value to the signal `rst_tmp` based on certain conditions. [Implementation details of the block] Specifically, `rst_tmp` is assigned the logical AND of the bitwise negations of `PLL_LOCK_R2` and `SELFREFRESH_MODE`; in other words, `rst_tmp` is true only when both `PLL_LOCK_R2` and `SELFREFRESH_MODE` are false. This might be part of a bigger module where `rst_tmp` acts as a reset signal that's affected by the lock state of a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) and whether the system is in a self-refresh mode."
