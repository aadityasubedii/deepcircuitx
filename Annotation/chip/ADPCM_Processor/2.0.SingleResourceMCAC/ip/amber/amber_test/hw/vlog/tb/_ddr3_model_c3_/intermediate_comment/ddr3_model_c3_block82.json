    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code initiates a timing check for the 49th bit of the `dq_in` bus whenever its value changes. It achieves this through the use of the `always @` event control construct, which executes the function `dq_timing_check` with the argument `48` whenever a change is detected on `dq_in[48]`."
