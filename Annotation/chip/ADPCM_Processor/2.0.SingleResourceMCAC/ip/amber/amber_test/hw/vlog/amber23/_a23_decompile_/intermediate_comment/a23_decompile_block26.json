    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to create a flip-flop that stores the value of 'xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE'. On every rising edge of 'i_clk', the value of 'xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE' gets latched into 'xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE_R'. This mechanism helps in realizing synchronous systems in sequential circuits, keeping instructions execution synchronized with the clock signal."
