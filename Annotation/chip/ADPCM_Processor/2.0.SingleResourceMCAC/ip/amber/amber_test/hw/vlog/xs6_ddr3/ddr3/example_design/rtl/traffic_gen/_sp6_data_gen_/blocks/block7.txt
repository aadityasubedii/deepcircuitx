The block synchronizes the assignment of hdata on every positive edge of the clock signal. Depending on the conditions, it assigns different hexadecimal values to hdata. On a reset signal, it assigns 0. In normal operation, if the fifo is ready and the user burst count is not zero, or if a start command is received, it evaluates the number of DQ pins (NUM_DQ_PINS) and assigns hexadecimal values based on the value of NUM_DQ_PINS. If NUM_DQ_PINS is 16, it assigns 'h0000FFFF_0000FFFF, if it's 8, it assigns 'h00FF00FF_00FF00FF, and if it's 4, it assigns 'h0F0F_0F0F_0F0F_0F0F.
