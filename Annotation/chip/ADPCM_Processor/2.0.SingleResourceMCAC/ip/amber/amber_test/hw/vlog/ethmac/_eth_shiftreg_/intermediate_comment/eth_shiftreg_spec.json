    "spec": "Module name: eth_shiftreg.\n\nModule specification: The eth_shiftreg functions as a shift register, processing control and status information for an Ethernet PHY module. There are multiple inputs including the clock signal 'Clk', reset signal 'Reset', enable signal 'MdcEn_n', data in 'Mdi', five-bit physical layer and register addresses 'Fiad' and 'Rgad', 16-bit control data 'CtrlData', operation type 'WriteOp', byte selector 'ByteSelect' and latching control 'LatchByte', which collectively drive and control the module functioning. The module generates outputs such as 'ShiftedBit', 16-bit status information 'Prsd', and a link failure flag 'LinkFail'.\n\nInternally, the module uses 'ShiftReg', an 8-bit register, for shifting operation and serialization/deserialization. Link failure status is determined using 'LinkFail' register and 'Prsd' is a 16-bit register holding the status information from the PHY. \n\nThe code encompasses various blocks such as the 'always' block which contains clocked and reset logic. If the reset is high, all the registers are initialized. Otherwise, depending on the 'MdcEn_n' signal and 'ByteSelect', the 'ShiftReg' is loaded with appropriate values. In the sub-block where 'ByteSelect' is null, 'ShiftReg' takes feedback from its own previous states and 'Mdi'. Depending on 'LatchByte', 'Prsd' is updated and 'LinkFail' condition is checked. The 'assign' statement assigns the most significant bit of 'ShiftReg' to 'ShiftedBit' to send it out as an output. The module successfully serializes and deserializes control and status data, thereby efficiently facilitating the communication between the MAC and the PHY of an Ethernet module.",

Fiad: This 5-bit input represents the physical layer address.\n6. Rgad: This 5-bit input represents the register address.\n7.

ByteSelect: This 4-bit input is used to select which byte to operate on.\n10. LatchByte: This 2-bit input controls latching in the shift register.\n\nExplanation: These inputs work together to control the operation of the shift register, including the selection of bytes to operate on, the kind of operation (read or write), and the latching of bytes.\n\nOutput ports:\n1.
