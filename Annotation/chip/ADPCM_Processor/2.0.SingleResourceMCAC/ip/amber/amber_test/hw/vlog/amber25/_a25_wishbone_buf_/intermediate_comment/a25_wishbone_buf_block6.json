    "block_comment": "The block of code performs functions related to a reset or pop operation on a write buffer read pointer (wbuf_rp_r) in a synchronous manner. On the rising edge of either 'reset' or 'clk', it checks if 'reset' is high; if that's   the case, 'wbuf_rp_r' is set to 0 regardless of its previous state. If 'reset' is not high (implying normal operation under the clock signal 'clk'), and 'pop' command is asserted, it inverts the value of 'wbuf_rp_r', effectively toggling the read pointer's state."
