    "block_comment": "This Verilog block handles the assignment of new register data to a set of pre-existing registers, based on the state of certain bits in the `i_mode_rds_exec` signal. If the `OH_FIRQ` bit is set, the block assigns the values of `r8_firq` through `r12_firq` to the `r8_rds` through `r12_rds` registers. In the case of `r13_rds` register, the value assigned depends on whether `OH_USR`, `OH_SVC` or `OH_IRQ` bit is set, with corresponding values assigned as `r13`, `r13_svc`, and `r13_irq`. If none of these conditions are met, `r13_firq` is assigned to `r13_rds`."
