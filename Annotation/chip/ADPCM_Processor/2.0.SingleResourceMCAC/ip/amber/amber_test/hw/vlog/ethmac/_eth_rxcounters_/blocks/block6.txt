This code block is determining the immediate output value of `ByteCntOut`. The output is conditionally determined based on the boolean value of `DlyCrcEn`. If `DlyCrcEn` is True, `ByteCntOut` will be assigned the delayed byte count `ByteCntDelayed`; otherwise, it will be assigned the immediate byte count `ByteCnt`.
