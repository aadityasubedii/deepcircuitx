This block handles the writing process of a first in, first out (FIFO) memory structure. At the edge of the write clock (wr_clk), if the write enable (wr_en) signal is high and the memory is not full, it writes the input data (wr_data) into the memory array (mem) at the address specified by the write address (wr_addr). The time of write delay is modeled by #TCQ.
