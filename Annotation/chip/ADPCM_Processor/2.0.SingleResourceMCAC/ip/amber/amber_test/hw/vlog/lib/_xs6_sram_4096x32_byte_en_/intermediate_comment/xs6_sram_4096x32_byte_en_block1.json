    "block_comment": "The block of code represents an instance of a SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) module in Verilog. It has write-enable and read data functionality. It operates with two clock domains but here only one clock domain is utilized, as evidenced by .CLKB(1'd0). Implementation-wise, data is written into the SRAM using a 8-bits data bus, as interpreted from '.DIA ({24'd0, i_write_data[7:0]})'. Besides, the '.WEA' signal controls the write operations and '.DOA' signal is used for reading out the data. Notably, this single port memory block is operating retrospectively i.e., it's read operation is disabled, refer .ENA(1'd1), while write operation is enabled, refer .WEA."
