    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for resetting or updating the 'RxStartFrm' while maintaining one delay cycle through 'RxStartFrm_d'. The block checks for either a positive edge clock (MRxClk) cycle or a system reset. If a system reset is detected, the 'RxStartFrm' and its delayed version 'RxStartFrm_d' are reset to '0'. If it's a new clock cycle and no reset is detected, 'RxStartFrm' is updated with the value of 'GenerateRxStartFrm' on the next clock cycle while 'RxStartFrm_d' takes on the prior assigned value of 'RxStartFrm', implementing a delay function for the signal flow."
