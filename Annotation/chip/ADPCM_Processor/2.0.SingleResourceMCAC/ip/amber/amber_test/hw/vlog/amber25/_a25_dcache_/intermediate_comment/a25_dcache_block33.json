    "block_comment": "This block is used to determine the busy state of an exclusive read cache. The busy state (ex_read_cache_busy) is set when there's an exclusive access in progress (!i_write_enable) and the cache state (c_state) is not idle (CS_IDLE). This is achieved through the use of a combination of logical operators (`&&`, `!=`, and `!`)."
