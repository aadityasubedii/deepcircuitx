This block is implemented as a DQS (Data Strobe) odd receiver. The receiver is triggered on the rising edge (positive edge) of the 16th element in the DQS odd array, indicated by the 'posedge' keyword and the index 15. The always keyword means the receiver is constantly monitoring for this rising edge event, and when it occurs, it calls the 'dqs_odd_receiver' function with the argument of 15.
