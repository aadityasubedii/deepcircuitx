    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is primarily used to interface a Wishbone bus for an Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) subsystem (ethmac_wb). The block uses two types of Wishbone interfaces: master (prefix m_) and slave (prefix s_); additionally, it also interfaces with the Ethernet MAC module itself (prefix em_). These interfaces support various operations such as read or write (control signals - wb_we), address location (_wb_adr), and data transfer (_wb_wdat for write and _wb_rdat for read). Through these control signals, the block facilitates the communication and data transfer between the CPU (via master-slave relationship) and the Ethernet MAC subsystem."
