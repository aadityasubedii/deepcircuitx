    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog assigns the value of the 'cke_train_reg' to 'cke_train'. Essentially, the function of this block is to ensure that 'cke_train' replicates or mirrors the value of the register 'cke_train_reg'. The implementation of this function is achieved through the 'assign' keyword in Verilog, which does the job of equating the values of 'cke_train' and 'cke_train_reg'. The end keyword indicates the end of this block."
