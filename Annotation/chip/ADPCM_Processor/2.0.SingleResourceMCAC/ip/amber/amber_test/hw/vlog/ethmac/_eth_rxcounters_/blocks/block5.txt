Comment: 
This block of Verilog code assigns binary flags to specific conditions based on the value of the `ByteCnt` variable. It checks equivalency of ByteCnt with numbers from 0 to 7, inclusively, as well as two additional conditions: if ByteCnt is greater than 2 and less than 7. Moreover, it checks if ByteCnt reaches its maximum value of 'hffff'. All conditions are binary and are used for further specific case detections.
