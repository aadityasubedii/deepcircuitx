    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for controlling the Least Significant Bits (LSB) of the Transmit Pointer (TxPointerLSB). Upon a rising edge of the write-back clock (WB_CLK_I) or a high-value Reset signal, the block begins its operation. If the Reset signal is high, it reinitializes the TxPointerLSB[1:0] to zero. However, when there is no reset, the block checks if the Transmission Enable (TxEn), the previous state of Transmission Enable (TxEn_q), and the TxPointer Read are all high. If these conditions are met, the least two bits of the RAM output (ram_do[1:0]) is passed to the Transmit Pointer LSB."
