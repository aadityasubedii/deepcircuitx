This block of code functions as a state machine, specifically in the UDQS_WAIT2 state, which handles waiting logic until the Memory Controller Block (MCB) is no longer busy. If the MCB is busy (`MCB_RDY_BUSY_N` equals 0), the state remains as UDQS_WAIT2. Once the MCB is ready, the code initializes `DQS_DELAY` and `TARGET_DQS_DELAY` to `DQS_DELAY_INITIAL` and transitions the state to `START_DYN_CAL` signifying the start of dynamic calibration.
