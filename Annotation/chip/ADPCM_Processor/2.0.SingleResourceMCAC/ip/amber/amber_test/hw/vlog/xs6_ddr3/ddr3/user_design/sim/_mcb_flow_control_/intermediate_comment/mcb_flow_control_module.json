    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mcb_flow_control' module is a flow controller for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) and handles different operations like read, write, and refresh. It uses input signals like clk_i (system clock), rst_i (reset), cmd_valid_i (command validate), addr_i (address), bl_i (block length), and data pointer readiness to define the system's state. Internal signals keep track of command validations and state transitions. Implementing an always block and a case statement, it directs state transitions, ensuring flow control within the MCB. Output signals indicate command readiness, validity of data pointers, and output command, address, and block length."
