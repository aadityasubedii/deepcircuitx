This block assigns a string type name to a given operation type indicated by 'itype'. The assignment uses conditional operator expressions to map each enum value of 'itype' (REGOP, MULT, SWAP, TRANS, MTRANS, BRANCH, CODTRANS, COREGOP, CORTRANS, SWI) to a corresponding string label. If 'itype' does not match any of these predefined operation types, it is labeled as 'UNKNOWN'.
