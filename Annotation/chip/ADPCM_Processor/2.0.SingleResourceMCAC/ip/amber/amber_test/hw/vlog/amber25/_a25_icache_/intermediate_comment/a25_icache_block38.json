    "block_comment": "The block assigns a new value to the `tag_wdata` variable based on the conditional `read_miss_fill`. If `read_miss_fill` is true, the block saves the most significant bits of the `miss_address` extended by a valid bit as `tag_wdata`. If `read_miss_fill` is false, the block initializes `tag_wdata` to all zeroes. This mechanism handles cache tagging, with updates depending on cache read misses."
