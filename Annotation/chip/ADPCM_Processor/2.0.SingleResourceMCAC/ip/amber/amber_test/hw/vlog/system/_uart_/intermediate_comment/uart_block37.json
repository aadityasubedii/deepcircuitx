    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions to set up a positive edge triggered flip-flop that stores the state of the \"wb_start_read\" signal on the rising edge of the \"i_clk\" signal. It uses a non-blocking assignment (<=) inside an \"always\" block that triggers on each positive edge of \"i_clk\", ensuring that the assignment takes place synchronously with the reference clock and preserving signal integrity throughout the design."
