    "block_comment": "The block of code is designed to monitor the 31st bit (index 30) of data input `dq_in`. The implementation utilizes an `always` block which is triggered each time the monitored bit changes, upon which it will call the function `dq_timing_check(30)`. This function is presumably designed to perform a timing check, or validation, with the specific bit as its parameter."
