    "block_comment": "This block of code is employed for managing a write flag, specifically to mark a buffer as 'full'. It accomplishes this through 'full' flag which is manipulated at each positive edge of the write clock (wr_clk). When the reset (rst) is triggered, the 'full' flag is reset to '0'. If no buffer availability is detected or if the write enable command (wr_en) is assigned while only one buffer is available, this flag is set to '1', signifying the buffer as 'full'. For all other instances, the 'full' flag is assigned as '0', indicating the buffer is not 'full'."
