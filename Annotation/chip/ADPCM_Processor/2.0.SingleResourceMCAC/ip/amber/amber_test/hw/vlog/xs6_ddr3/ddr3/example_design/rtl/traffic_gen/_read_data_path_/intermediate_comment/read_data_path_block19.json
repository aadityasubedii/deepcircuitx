    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential circuit design for managing data comparison validity. It operates synchronously with the rising edge of the clock signal (clk_i). When the clock signal transitions from low to high, the value of the signal rd_mdata_en is assigned after a delay defined by TCQ to the v6_data_cmp_valid signal, hence controlling the data comparison process and ensuring its precision."
