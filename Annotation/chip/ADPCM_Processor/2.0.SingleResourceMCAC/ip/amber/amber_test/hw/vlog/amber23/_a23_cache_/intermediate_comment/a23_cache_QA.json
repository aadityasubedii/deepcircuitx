The cache operates with a configurable number of cache lines and cache words per line, along with parameters that dictate the size of addresses, tags, and lines. The module has several inputs and outputs which control and report the cache state, including commands like read, write, flush, etc. The module includes logic for different states and operations such as initialization, idle, fill, invalidate, and write hit. All these states have specific functionality that control the cache behavior. It also contains logic to handle data hit in single and multiple cache ways. An important part of the module is the tag comparison for cache hit, and the logic for read and write operations."
