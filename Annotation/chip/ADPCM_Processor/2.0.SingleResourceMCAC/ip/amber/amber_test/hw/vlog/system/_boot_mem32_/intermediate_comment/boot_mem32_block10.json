    "block_comment": "The presented Verilog code defines a register or sequential logic that updates its value based on certain conditions. Specifically, this block uses a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) to create a jitter pattern. On the positive edge of the 'i_wb_clk' clock signal, the 8-bit register 'jitter_r' shifts bits to the right and updates the most significant bit (MSB) with the XOR of the current 2nd, 5th, and 8th bits. This kind of shift and update scheme is typically used in frequency dividers and pseudo-random number generators."
