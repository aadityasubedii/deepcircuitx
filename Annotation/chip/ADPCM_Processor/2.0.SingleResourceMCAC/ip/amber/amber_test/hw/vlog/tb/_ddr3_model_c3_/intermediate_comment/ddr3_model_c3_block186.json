    "block_comment": "The block initiates a DQS receiver process on a positive edge triggering of the DQS signal. It achieves this by invoking the DQS receiver function specifically on the 6th element (index 5) of the 'dqs_odd' array whenever a positive edge is detected on the DQS line. The function 'dqs_odd_receiver' is invoked with the index '5' as its parameter, which signifies operation on the 6th element of the 'dqs_odd' array. This block is typically part of a larger memory interface system where data strobe signals play a crucial role in synchronizing data transfer."
