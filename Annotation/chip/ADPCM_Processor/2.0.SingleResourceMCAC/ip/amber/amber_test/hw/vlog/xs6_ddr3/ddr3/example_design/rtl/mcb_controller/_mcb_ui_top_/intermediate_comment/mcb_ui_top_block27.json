    "block_comment": "The function `calc_num_time_slots` computes the number of time slots based on the enabled ports and the port configuration. It iteratively checks the 'port_enable' input array to count the number of enabled ports, increasing 'num_ports' by one for each enabled port. The final number of time slots is decided based on 'port_config' and the number of enabled ports: if the port configuration is 1 and there are 5 enabled ports, then the number of time slots is 10, otherwise it is 12."
