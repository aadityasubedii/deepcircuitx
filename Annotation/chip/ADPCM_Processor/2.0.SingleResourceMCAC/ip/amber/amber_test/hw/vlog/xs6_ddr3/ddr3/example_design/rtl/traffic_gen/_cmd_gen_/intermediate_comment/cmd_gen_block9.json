    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the assignment of instructions based on the value of 'instr_mode_i' on the rising edge of the clock signal. On each clock cycle, the 'instr_out' variable is assigned with data from one of the seven different instructions or a default instruction, all delayed by a timing control queue (TCQ) for synchronization. Depending on 'instr_mode_i', sourced data include direct instruction (bram_instr_i, fixed_instr_i), manipulated fields of prbs_instr_a or prbs_instr_b, or a combination thereof. The block implements a case statement within an always block to handle these instruction assignments."
