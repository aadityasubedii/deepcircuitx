The block is implemented to identify if there is a hit in any of the ways of cache data (Function of the block). This is achieved by employing bitwise OR operation on every bit of data_hit_way, resulting in 'idle_hit' obtaining a high value ('1') if there's hit in any way and a low value otherwise ('0') (Implementation details of the block).
