    "block_comment": "This block of code checks if the operation code (`opcode`) is either a MOV (Move) or MVN (Move Not) instruction. It uses a logical OR operator to check equality between the `opcode` and two defined constants `MOV` and `MVN` and assigns the result to the variable `opcode_move`. When `opcode` corresponds to either of the two instructions, `opcode_move` is set to 1 (true), otherwise, it is set to 0 (false)."
