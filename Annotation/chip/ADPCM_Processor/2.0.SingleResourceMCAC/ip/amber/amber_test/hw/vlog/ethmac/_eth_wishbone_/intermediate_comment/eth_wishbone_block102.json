    "block_comment": "This block manages the address assignment for the Receive Buffer Descriptor (RxBD) in a data communication system. It operates synchronously with the Write Burst Clock (WB_CLK_I) and resets upon activation of the Reset signal. When Reset is asserted, the RxBD address is forced to zero. On a rising clock edge, if the receive enable signal (r_RxEn) is true, and the previous state of r_RxEn (r_RxEn_q) is false, the RxBD address adopts the value of r_TxBDNum[6:0]. When the RxStatusWrite flag is raised, the TempRxBDAddress is assigned to RxBDAddress."
