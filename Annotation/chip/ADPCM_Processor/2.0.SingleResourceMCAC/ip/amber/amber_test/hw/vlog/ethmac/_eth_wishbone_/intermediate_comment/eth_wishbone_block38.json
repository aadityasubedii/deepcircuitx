    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for controlling the latch for the start of frame reception in response to RX signals. It does so by checking the rising edge clock and the reset signal. When a reset signal is received, it immediately resets the latch for the RX frame start. If not reset, the block checks if the RX start frame has been received and if the synchronized RX start frame hasn't been queued, then it manually starts the latching of the RX frame. If the synchronized RX start frame is queued, it completely stops the latching process."
