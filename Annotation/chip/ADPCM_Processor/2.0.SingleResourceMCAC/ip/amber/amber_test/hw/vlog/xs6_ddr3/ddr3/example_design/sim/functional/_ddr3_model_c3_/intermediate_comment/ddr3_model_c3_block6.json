    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for invoking the dqs_neg_timing_check function whenever there is a positive edge on the 27th bit of the dqs_in signal (indexing starts at 0). The function call is wrapped inside an always block which is triggered at every positive transition in the specified bit, thus ensuring accurate timing checks specific to this element in the dqs_in signal."
