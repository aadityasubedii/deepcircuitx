    "block_comment": "This block of code is tasked with the function of triggering the `dqs_odd_receiver` at the rising edge of signal `dqs_odd[12]`. The code accomplishes this by using the always@ construct to continuously monitor the `dqs_odd[12]` signal and calls the `dqs_odd_receiver` function when it detects a positive edge. This implies that `dqs_odd` is likely a clock signal or similar synchronization mechanism, and `dqs_odd_receiver` is a function that should execute on every rising edge of the signal."
