    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a delay in the 'ras_n' signal propagation. Specifically, it uses a delay statement denoted by '#' followed by 'BUS_DELAY' to indicate an intentional delay for the 'ras_n' signal. During each positive edge of the 'ras_n' signal, the block assigns the current value of 'ras_n' to the 'ras_n_in' after the specified 'BUS_DELAY'. The purpose of this technique, often used in hardware designing, is to help synchronize the signals or to meet the setup and hold time requirements of the flip flops downstream from this block."
