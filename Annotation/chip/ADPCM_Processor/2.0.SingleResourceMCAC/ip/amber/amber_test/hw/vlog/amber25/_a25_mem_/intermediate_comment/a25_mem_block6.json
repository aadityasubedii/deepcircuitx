    "block_comment": "The `void_output` signal is controlled by this block of code. By implementing a logical OR operation, the expression determines whether a stall condition exists or data from memory has been validated. In more detail, `void_output` is assigned true when: `fetch_only_stall_r` and `fetch_only_stall` are both true, or, `fetch_only_stall_r` and `mem_read_data_valid_r` are both true. This essentially coordinates and controls process synchronization during data fetching."
