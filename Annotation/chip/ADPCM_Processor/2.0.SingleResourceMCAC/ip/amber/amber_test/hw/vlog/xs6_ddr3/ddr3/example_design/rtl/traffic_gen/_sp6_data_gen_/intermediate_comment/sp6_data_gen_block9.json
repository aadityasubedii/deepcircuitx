    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is controlling the value of the variable 'hdata' based on a number of different factors and cases. The initial case involves a reset signal 'rst_i': when this is active, the 'hdata' variable is reset to zero. The other cases involve checking readiness signals from a data FIFO queue and user burst count, or the execution of a start command. If any of these parameters are valid, the hardware performs additional checks against the number of data query (DQ) pins available on the device. The 'hdata' variable is then updated with different 32-bit patterns based on the number of available DQ pins."
