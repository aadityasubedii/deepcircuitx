Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for managing the Counter operations. When either a Clk signal receives a positive edge or a Reset signal is received, the Counter is updated accordingly. If a Reset signal is detected, the Counter is set to 8'h1 after a propagation delay (#Tp). If a Reset signal is not detected and the CountEq0 is true, the Counter is set to the CounterPreset value after a propagation delay (#Tp). If CounterEq0 is false, the Counter is decremented by one after the same delay.
