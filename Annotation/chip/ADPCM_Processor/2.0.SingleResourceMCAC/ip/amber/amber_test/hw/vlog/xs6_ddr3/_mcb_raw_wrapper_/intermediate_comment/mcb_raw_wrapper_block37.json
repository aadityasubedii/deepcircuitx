    "block_comment": "This block of code is meant for initializing the simulation system. It primarily executes during the simulation phase and is set to bypass the required 200 microsecond wait period before CKE becomes active. This is achieved by assigning the maximum 16-bit hexadecimal value to the variable 'wait_200us_counter', essentially overflowing the counter and immediately moving past the wait state. Additionally, it displays a message to notify the user that this certain wait period is being skipped for the simulation."
