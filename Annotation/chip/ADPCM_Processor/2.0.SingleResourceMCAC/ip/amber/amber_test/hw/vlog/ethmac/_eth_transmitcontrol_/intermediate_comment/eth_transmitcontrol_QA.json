It handles data flow control, error checks via CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), and prepares control frames for transmission. It also controls the completion of frame transfer, accounts for any pauses required in the transmission, and manages any transmission aborts. Control signals to start and end the transmission process are also generated. Further, this module ensures the necessary encoding of control traffic data and implements several counters for smooth functioning of communication. It's an integral part of data transmission control in an Ethernet module setup."
