Module-level comment: The 'eth_maccontrol' module abstracts the control frames' management in an Ethernet MAC adapter, interfacing with both reception and transmission subsystems. It relies on internal signals, latches, multiplexers, alongside input-output ports to control transmission flow, and manage conditions such as frame start, end, abort, and done. Critical sub-modules 'eth_receivecontrol' and 'eth_transmitcontrol' are instantiated for bespoke receive and transmit operations. The module can function in two clock domains for transmit (MTxClk) and receive (MRxClk) operations.
