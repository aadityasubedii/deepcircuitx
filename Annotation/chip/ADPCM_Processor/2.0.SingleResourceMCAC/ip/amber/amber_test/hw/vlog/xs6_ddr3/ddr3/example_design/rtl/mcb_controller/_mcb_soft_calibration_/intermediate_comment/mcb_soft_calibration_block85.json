    "block_comment": "The block of code is essentially a 16-bit counter used to wait for 200 microseconds, triggered by the rising edge of the user interface clock (UI_CLK) or a reset signal (RST). When reset is high, the counter is initialized either to \"16'h7FF0\" in the case of simulation or to \"0\" under normal operation. If the reset is not triggered and the most significant bit of the counter (WAIT_200us_COUNTER[15]) is not set, the counter increments by one. The block contains conditionals and counter operations typically used in digital circuits for delay implementation. This block persists its state across multiple clock cycles, hence it represents its behaviour as sequential logic."
