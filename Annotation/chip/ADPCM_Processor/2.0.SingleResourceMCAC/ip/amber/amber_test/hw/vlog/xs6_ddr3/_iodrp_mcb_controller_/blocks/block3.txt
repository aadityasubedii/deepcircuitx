Comment: 
This line of code is a conditional assignment statement in Verilog, used to set the value of DRP_SDI. Depending on the state of rd_not_write_reg, DRP_CS, and DRP_ADD signals, the value of DRP_SDI is determined. More specifically, when rd_not_write_reg, DRP_CS are high (1) and DRP_ADD is low (0), the value of DRP_SDI is set to the value of DRP_SDO. Otherwise, it retains its previous value (DRP_SDI_pre).
