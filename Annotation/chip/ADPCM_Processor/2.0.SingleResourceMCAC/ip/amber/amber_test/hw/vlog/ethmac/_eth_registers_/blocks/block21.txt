Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is designed to perform synchronous reset and simple flip-flop operations. When initiated, the snippet examines whether the 'Reset' input is asserted. If so, 'SetTxCIrq_sync3' is reset synchronously with the clock (Clk) edge, thereby ensuring the system's request to halt transmission (Tx) if necessary. If the 'Reset' signal is not asserted, 'SetTxCIrq_sync3' simply follows 'SetTxCIrq_sync2', promoting the change in the latter's state during the next clock (Clk) cycle. This flip-flop behavior essentially aids signal synchronization across different clock domains.
