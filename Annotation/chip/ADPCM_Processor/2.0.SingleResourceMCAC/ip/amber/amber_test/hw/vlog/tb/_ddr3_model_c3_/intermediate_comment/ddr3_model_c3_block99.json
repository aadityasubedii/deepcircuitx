    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code initiates a timing check for the 32nd bit of the digital input data, `dq_in[31]`. The `always @` command ensures that this function is triggered every time `dq_in[31]` changes state, regardless of the nature of the change. Consequently, the system monitors the 32nd bit timing, flagging any anomalies detected. This check may contribute to high digital signal fidelity and smooth data flow."
