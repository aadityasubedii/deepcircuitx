Comment: 
This block of code generates output buffers for bank address signals in a memory controller. Using Verilog's generate and for-loop constructs, the block iteratively creates an instance of the output buffer `OBUFT` for each bit in the memory bank address, with the number of bits defined by the constant `C_MEM_BANKADDR_WIDTH`. Each instance is associated with corresponding input (`ioi_ba`), output enable (`t_ba`), and output (`mcbx_dram_ba`) signals.
