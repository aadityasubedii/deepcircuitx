    "block_comment": "This logic block in Verilog serves as a verification method for timing constraints, specifically the Input Hold Time (tIH) and Input Pulse Width (tIPW), associated with 'CKE' signal in a digital system. Incorporated with 'always' keyword, it constantly checks the violation of these timing parameters on every state change of signal 'cke_in'. If reset 'rst_n_in' is high, the block monitors whether current timestamp is greater than specified 'tIH'; if so, it identifies if the difference between current time and the timestamp of last positive clock is less than 'tIH', interpreting it as a tIH violation. Additionally, it also inspects timing violations concerning 'tIPW' by comparing it with the difference between current and previous timestamps. In case of violations, it flags error messages with the extent of deviation. Timestamp 'tm_cke' is updated with the current time at the end of each iteration."
