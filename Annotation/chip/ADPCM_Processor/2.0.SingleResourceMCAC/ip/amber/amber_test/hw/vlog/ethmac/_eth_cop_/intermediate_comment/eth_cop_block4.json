    "block_comment": "This line of code in Verilog represents the condition under which a write back access operation is considered finished. It uses the logical OR operator to check if any of four signals (`m1_wb_ack_o`, `m1_wb_err_o`, `m2_wb_ack_o`, `m2_wb_err_o`) is high. If any one of these signals is high, the `m_wb_access_finished` signal is asserted, indicating the completion of the write back operation. This could either be a successful acknowledgment or an error acknowledgment from either of the two modules: m1 and m2."
