    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for triggering a DQS (Data Strobe) even signal receiver function whenever a positive edge is detected in the first line of the DQS even signal. This happens because the statement is always @ (posedge dqs_even[ 0]), meaning it continuously monitors the first element in the 'dqs_even' array for a transition from 0 to 1 (positive edge). When this occurs, it calls the 'dqs_even_receiver' function with an argument of '0'."
