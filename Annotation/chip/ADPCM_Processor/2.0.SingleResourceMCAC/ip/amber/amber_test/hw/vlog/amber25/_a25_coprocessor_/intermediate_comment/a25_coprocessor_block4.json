    "block_comment": "The code block controls the writing operation to the register 'copro15_reg1' in a coprocessor. It implements this by using an 'assign' statement to set 'copro15_reg1_write' to true only when the core is not stalled ('i_core_stall' is false), the coprocessor operation is of type 2 (represented by 'i_copro_operation' being equal to '2'd2') and the current register in use by the coprocessor is register 1 ('i_copro_crn' equals '4'd1')."
