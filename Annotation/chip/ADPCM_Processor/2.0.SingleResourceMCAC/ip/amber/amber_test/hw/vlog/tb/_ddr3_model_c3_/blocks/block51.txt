Comment: 
The block captures the positive edge of the signal 'dqs_in' on the 14th bit. This is done through an always block that checks for a positive edge on the 14th bit of 'dqs_in' array, triggering the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function every time a rising edge is detected. The signal is monitored constantly, enabling real-time updates and responses to changes in the bit status.
