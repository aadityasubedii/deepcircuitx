The given code block is a conditional clocked generate statement block in a Verilog code. It operates based on a set of predefined conditions related to the quantity of DQ pins used (set to 48) and the data pattern selected (could be "DGEN_NEIGHBOR", "DGEN_WALKING1", "DGEN_WALKING0", or "DGEN_ALL"). If these conditions are met, the always @ (posedge clk_i) block will be activated at every rising clock edge, triggering whatever is coded within this block in the larger context.
