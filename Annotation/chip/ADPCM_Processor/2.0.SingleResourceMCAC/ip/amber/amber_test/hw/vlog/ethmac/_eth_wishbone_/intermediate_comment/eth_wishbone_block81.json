    "block_comment": "This block of code acts as a synchronizer that handles the 'TxUnderRun' signal under different conditions within a transmitter's context. The state of 'TxUnderRun_sync1' is updated based on the specific rules subjected to clock 'MTxClk' and reset 'Reset' signals. If 'Reset' is high, 'TxUnderRun_sync1' is reset to 0. If a writeback ('TxUnderRun_wb') occurs, 'TxUnderRun_sync1' is set to 1. However, if the blocking transmission status ('BlockingTxStatusWrite_sync2') is enabled, 'TxUnderRun_sync1' returns to 0."
