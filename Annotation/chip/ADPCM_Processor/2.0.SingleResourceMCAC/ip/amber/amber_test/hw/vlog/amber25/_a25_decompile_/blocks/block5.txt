Comment: 
This function block generates a 32-bit signal based on the input provided. It uses a case switch to select one of multiple possible outputs, sourced from a hardware module titled `U_EXECUTE`, or from a module titled `U_WB`. Based on the 3-bit input number, the function sets `get_32bit_signal` as one of six possible 32-bit signals: `pc_nxt`, `o_iaddress`, `o_daddress`, `o_write_data` from `U_EXECUTE` module, or `i_wb_read_data` from the `U_EXECUTE` and `daddress_r` from the `U_WB` modules.
