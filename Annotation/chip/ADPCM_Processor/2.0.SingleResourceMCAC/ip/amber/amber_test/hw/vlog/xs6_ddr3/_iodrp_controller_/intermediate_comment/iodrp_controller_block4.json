    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for assigning values to the DRP_ADD, DRP_CS, and DRP_BKST control signals based on the current state machine phase. Whenever a positive edge of DRP_CLK is detected, the DRP_ADD and DRP_CS signals are assigned a boolean value depending on whether the next state is the ADDR_PHASE or DATA_PHASE respectively. The DRP_BKST signal, used to indicate the use of broadcasting, is assigned the value of 'use_broadcast' only if the current state is READY."
