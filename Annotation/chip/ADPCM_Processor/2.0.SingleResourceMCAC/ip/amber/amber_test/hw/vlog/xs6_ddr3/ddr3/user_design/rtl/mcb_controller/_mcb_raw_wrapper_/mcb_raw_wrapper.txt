Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements a Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper for DRAM interfaces.
It handles address/data signals, command generation, and I/O operations for various
DRAM types. The module uses IODRP2_MCB for delay/calibration, OSERDES2 for
serialization, and IOBUFs for bidirectional signals. It supports flexible port
configurations and includes calibration logic for timing adjustments.
