This block is a conditional instantiation of the DDR3 model for a memory interface corresponding to different number of data query(DQ) pins. If the number of DQ pins is equal to 16, certain bit concatenated ports like dm_tdqs, dqs, dqs_n are fed to the DDR3 model with concatenation of user-defined and normal DQ signals. If the DQ pins are not 16, then the same DDR3 model is instantiated however this time dm_tdqs gets only direct normal DQ signal, without any concatenation. Both conditions share common interface signals such as clock(ck, ck_n), command signals (cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), bus address signal (ba), address signal (addr), data signal(dq), termination resistance(odt) and reset signal(rst_n).
