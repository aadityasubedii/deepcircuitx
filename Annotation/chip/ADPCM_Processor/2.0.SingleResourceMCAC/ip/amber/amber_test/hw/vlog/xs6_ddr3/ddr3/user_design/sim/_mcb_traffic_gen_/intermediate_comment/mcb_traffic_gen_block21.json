    "block_comment": "The given block of code is responsible for resolving and managing the condition of a 'FIFO' error within a memory interface block. It works by detecting the rising edge of the input clock signal. When the signal 'mcb_cmd_en_o' is active, the code checks if the transfer address is unequal to the command address. In case of inequality, it sets the 'fifo_error' signal as high after a delay defined by 'TCQ', indicating a FIFO error. Otherwise, it resets the 'fifo_error' signal to low after the defined delay, signifying the absence of an error."
