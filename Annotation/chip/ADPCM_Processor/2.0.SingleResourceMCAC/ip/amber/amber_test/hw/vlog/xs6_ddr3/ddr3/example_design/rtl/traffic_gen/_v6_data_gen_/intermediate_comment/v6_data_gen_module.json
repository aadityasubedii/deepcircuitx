    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/* \nThis module generates various data patterns for memory testing, including address-based, PRBS, walking 1/0, neighbor, hammer, and fixed patterns. It supports different data widths (8-144 bits) and burst lengths.\n\nThe module uses a combination of counters, shift registers, and PRBS generators to create patterns based on input parameters and control signals. It selects and outputs the appropriate pattern according to the specified data mode, implementing flexible pattern generation for different memory configurations and test scenarios.\n*/"
