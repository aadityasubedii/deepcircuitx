    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code governs the reading and writing operations of a memory controller block (MCB), as well as its calibration procedure. Implementation-wise, it shortens AXI to MCB data translation by directly mapping the AXI read and write signals to their corresponding MCB signals. Validation to check for empty/full states, error states, and underflow/overflow conditions are all integrated. Additionally, it includes calibration completion status output."
