The block is a state machine that manages the 'TxBDReady' signal in a communication context. When a rising edge is detected on either 'WB_CLK_I' or 'Reset', the block's behavior changes. If the 'Reset' signal is high, 'TxBDReady' is set to 0, effectively resetting it. Else if 'TxEn', 'TxEn_q' and 'TxBDRead' are all high, 'TxBDReady' is set to the conjunction of the 16th bit of 'ram_do' and a check if the 17th to 32nd bits of 'ram_do' are greater than 4. If 'ResetTxBDReady' is high, 'TxBDReady' is reset to 0.
