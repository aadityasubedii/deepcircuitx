This block of code ensures command address synchronization in the system. It utilizes an 'always' block, a fundamental construct in verilog which means that the block of code inside it will execute whenever any change happens to the signal or event specified after '@'. Here, the change being inspected is the 8th bit (index 7) of the 'addr_in' signal, triggering 'cmd_addr_timing_check(14)'. This checking function provides a constant timestamp to ensure synchronization between the command address signal and the system clock.
