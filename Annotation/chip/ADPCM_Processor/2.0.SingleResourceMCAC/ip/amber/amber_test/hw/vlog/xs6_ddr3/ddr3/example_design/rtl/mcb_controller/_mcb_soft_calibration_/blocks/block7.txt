This block determines the next state of a dynamic calibration process based on certain values and conditions. If the first dynamic calibration hasn't been completed, it begins anew. Otherwise, it compares Max_Value with its previous value and a threshold. Depending on the comparison, it either decrements or increments the state. Additionally, it updates TARGET_DQS_DELAY, using a function Mult_Divide with Max_Value and constants DQS_NUMERATOR and DQS_DENOMINATOR as arguments. Finally, if none of the conditions apply, it starts the dynamic calibration after assigning the Max_Value_Previous to Max_Value.
