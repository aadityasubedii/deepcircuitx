    "block_comment": "This block of code is for generating data patterns in specific scenarios. When the total number of Data Query (DQ) pins equals 56, and the data pattern is either \"DGEN_NEIGHBOR\", \"DGEN_WALKING1\", \"DGEN_WALKING0\" or \"DGEN_ALL\", this block will activate. The function is implemented using a Generate If statement. It's sensitive to the positive edge of the input clock, meaning it will execute on a rising edge of the clock signal."
