    "module": "Module-level comment: This testbench module simulates and verifies a DDR3 memory controller design. It generates clock and reset signals, instantiates the DDR3 controller and memory model, and monitors calibration and test completion. The module sets up simulation parameters, connects internal signals between components, and includes error checking mechanisms. It logs calibration status and test results, displaying \"TEST PASSED\" or \"TEST FAILED\" messages based on simulation outcomes."
