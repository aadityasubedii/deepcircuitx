This block assigns a value to the `ex_read_cache_busy` signal. Its function is to act as a gate for the business state of the exclusive access read cache. The block fulfills this function by taking into account three primary conditions: there is an exclusive access (`exclusive_access` is true), the write enable is off (`!i_write_enable`), and the cache state is not idle (`c_state != CS_IDLE`). The `ex_read_cache_busy` signal is thus set when an exclusive read access is required, write operations are prohibited, and the cache state is not idle.
