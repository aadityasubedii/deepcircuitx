    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'a23_core' module encapsulates the core of the A23 processor, handling data signaling, memory writing, processing, and error handling. This is achieved by interfacing with sub-modules such as 'a23_fetch' for instruction fetching, 'a23_decode' for instruction decoding, 'a23_execute' for executing commands, and 'a23_coprocessor' for coprocessing operations. Inputs and outputs are managed via defined ports, while internal signals orchestrate the flow of operations, statuses, and data within the module."
