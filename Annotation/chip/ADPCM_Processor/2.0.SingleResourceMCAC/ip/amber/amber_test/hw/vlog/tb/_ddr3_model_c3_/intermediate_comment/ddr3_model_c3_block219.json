    "block_comment": "This block of code is a task that sets the read and write latency of a system based on additive latency and CAS latency. If the additive latency provided (al) is zero, the additive latency is set to 0. Otherwise, it's calculated by subtracting the additive latency (al) from the CAS latency. Next, the read latency is set to be the sum of the CAS latency and the calculated additive latency. Similarly, the write latency is the sum of the CAS write latency and the computed additive latency."
