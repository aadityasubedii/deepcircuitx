Comment: 
This block is set up to trigger a timing check function called 'dqs_pos_timing_check'. The trigger occurs on the falling edge of the signal 'dqs_in' at the 22nd index. This action is done frequently whenever there is a negative edge detected, indicating that the 'dqs_pos_timing_check' function is used to regularly verify the timing for the 'dqs_in[22]' signal.
