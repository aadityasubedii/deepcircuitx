Comment: 
This block is responsible for controlling the "force_bl1" flag based on various conditions. This flag, initialized to zero upon the sixth bit of "rst_i" signal being high, is primarily made high if either the sum of "addr_out" and the product of "bl_out" and (DWIDTH/8) is greater or equal to "end_addr_i", or when there are 50 or less buffers available and the port is in read mode. If neither of these conditions are met, the flag is kept at zero.
