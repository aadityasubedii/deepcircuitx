    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the selection of Burst Length Mode (bl_mode_sel) in a synchronous design. The block is triggered at the rising edge of the supplied clock (clk_i). When the reset signal (rst_i) is high, or when the design is targeted for a 'VIRTEX6' Family FPGA, the Burst Length Mode is set to a fixed mode (FIXED_BL_MODE). Otherwise, if these conditions are not met and the vio_modify_enable is toggled high, the Burst Length Mode is set according to the 'vio_bl_mode_value'."
