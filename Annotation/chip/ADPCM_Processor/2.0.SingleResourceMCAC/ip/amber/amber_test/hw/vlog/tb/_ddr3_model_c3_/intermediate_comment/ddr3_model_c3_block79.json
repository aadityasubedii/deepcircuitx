    "block_comment": "The block triggers the function `dq_timing_check(51)` whenever there are changes in the 51st bit of the `dq_in` signal. Specifically, the `always @` construct in Verilog is used for describing the behavior that should happen whenever the item within the parentheses (`dq_in[51]` here) changes, thus the code implies a sensitivity to the 51st bit of `dq_in`, which signifies that whenever this bit changes, the functionality `dq_timing_check(51)` is executed."
