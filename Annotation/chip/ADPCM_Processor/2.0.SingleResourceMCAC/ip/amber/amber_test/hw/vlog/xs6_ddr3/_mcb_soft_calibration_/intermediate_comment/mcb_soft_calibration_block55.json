    "block_comment": "This block of code is involved with Load Resistor ZQ and Non-Terminated DDR Operations (LOAD_RZQ_NTERM). It sets active IODRP (Input/Output Data Retention Protection) to the value of RZQ, sets the command as valid, sets the memory cell address to non-terminated operation, and prepares the write data with Non-Terminated value. This is done in a write mode, and only gets executed when the IODRP control is ready."
