Comment: 
This block of code is a continuous data assignment where the input data (i_rdata) is being passed to the output (o_rdata). This assignment is implemented through the 'assign' statement which in Verilog RTL code makes a continuous assignment, which will always drive the left-hand-side operand (o_rdata) with the result of the right-hand-side operand (i_rdata). This means that any change in the value of i_rdata will immediately reflect on o_rdata.
