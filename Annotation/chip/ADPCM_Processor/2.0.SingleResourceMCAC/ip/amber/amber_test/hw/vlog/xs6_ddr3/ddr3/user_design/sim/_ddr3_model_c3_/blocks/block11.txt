The block initializes a timing check every time there's a rising edge detect on the 22nd bit of the input data queue (dqs_in). Specifically, this function sends a signal to the dqs_neg_timing_check function when a positive edge on the 22nd bit of the dqs_in is spotted, ensuring mutual timing requirements are satisfied.
