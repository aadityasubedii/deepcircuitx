Comment: 
This code block represents an asynchronous reset and data count update module in a pipeline circuit. It operates on every positive edge of the input clock (`clk_i`). Upon receiving a reset signal (`rst_i[0]`), the read data count (`rd_data_counts_asked`) is cleared to 0. If no reset signal is active but a valid pipe data signal (`instr_vld_dly1`) is detected with a high bit on position 32 of `pipe_data_in`, the `rd_data_counts_asked` will be incremented either by constant 64 if bits 35 to 40 of `pipe_data_in` are all zero, or by the value contained in bits 35 to 40 of `pipe_data_in` otherwise. The `#TCQ` notation hints at a timing constraint but the actual delay value isn't specified.
