Module name: a23_decode. Module specification: The a23_decode module is responsible for decoding ARM instructions and generating control signals for the execution stage of an ARM processor. It handles various instruction types, manages the processor's state machine, and controls the flow of execution. The module takes inputs such as clock (i_clk), read data (i_read_data), fetch stall (i_fetch_stall), interrupt requests (i_irq, i_firq), abort signals (i_dabt, i_iabt, i_adex), execution address (i_execute_address), abort status (i_abt_status), status bits (i_execute_status_bits), and multiply done signal (i_multiply_done). It produces numerous output signals, including read data (o_read_data), immediate values (o_imm32), register selections (o_rm_sel, o_rds
