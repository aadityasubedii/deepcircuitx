    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block functions as a synchronous reset logic for the transmission start frame signal. It gets triggered at every positive edge of the write back clock or a system reset. If a reset signal is detected, the 'TxStartFrm_syncb1' signal is asynchronously set to zero to halt the frame transmission immediately. Otherwise, in the absence of a reset, it just follows the 'TxStartFrm_sync2' signal's behavior."
