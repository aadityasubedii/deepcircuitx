    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the timing check for data strobe signals in memory interfacing upon the positive edge of the 32nd bit of the input data. It uses an always block to continuously monitor the 32nd 'dqs_in' bit for a positive edge transition. If a positive edge is encountered, it triggers the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function with '31' as an input, which then initiates a timing check for the negatively-edge-triggered 'dqs' signals."
