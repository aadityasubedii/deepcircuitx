    "block_comment": "This block of code represents an initial setup routine for a test bench in Verilog [Function of the block]. It starts by setting the time format for simulation log to nanoseconds with two digits after the decimal point. Next, it checks for the definition of 'SDFSCAN'. If SDFSCAN is defined, it includes the annotation from the specified SDF file to enable more accurate timing simulation. After this, it asserts low values to all inputs of the Unit Under Test (UUT), such as reset, test_mode, and scan inputs. Finally, it issues a $finish command which terminates the simulation immediately [Implementation details of the block]."
