    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The \"test\" module is designed as a top-level module used for testing an integrated unit \"UPA1\". It initializes necessary inputs such as a clock signal (clk), reset signal (reset), scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), scan enable signal (scan_enable), and test mode signal (test_mode) to an instance of the 'UPA1' unit and applies them as input. It also links up scan output wires (scan_out0 to scan_out4) from the 'UPA1' unit and hands over the scan outputs. Additionally, it sets the time-format and potentially loads the Standard Delay Format (SDF) file for 'UPA1' if the compilation is performed with 'SDFSCAN' definition. At the beginning, it sets all the inputs to zero and expects a test sequence to provide different values for simulating and observing the behavior of the unit under test.\nThe test module provides nine input ports which include clk for providing synchronization, reset for changing the module to its initial state, scan_in0 to scan_in4 for testing the UPA1 unit, scan_enable for controlling the scan mode during test, and test_mode for switching between normal and test mode. It also has five output ports, scan_out0 to scan_out4, for reading the serial outputs from the unit under test (UPA1).\nInternally, the test module uses signals that are almost all the input ports such as clk for synchronizing the operations, reset for resetting the module, scan_in0 to scan_in4 for providing test vectors to UPA1, scan_enable for controlling the scan mode and test_mode for toggling between normal operation and test mode.\nThe test module utilizes an 'initial' block where important settings like time format are set and the SDF file for UPA1 is loaded when the compilation is performed with 'SDFSCAN' definition. It also initializes all its inputs to zero and calls a '$finish'. After this initialization, a test sequence is expected to provide various inputs to test the module.",
