    "module": "Module-level comment: This 'test' module is a top-level testing unit for integrated block 'UPA1'. It initializes and drives the 'UPA1' unit with inputs (clk, reset, scan inputs, scan_enable, and test_mode). Also, scan outputs from 'UPA1' are extracted via scan_out{0-4}. Initial block sets the time-format, optionally on 'SDFSCAN' definition, loads UPA1's SDF file, and initializes inputs to zero. A test sequence is expected later to stimulate different test inputs."
