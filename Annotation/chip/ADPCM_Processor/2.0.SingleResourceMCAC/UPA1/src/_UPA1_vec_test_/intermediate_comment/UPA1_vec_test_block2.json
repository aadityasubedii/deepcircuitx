    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a clock signal with a period defined by the `CLK_PERIOD` constant. The `always` block is continuously executed, toggling the `clk` signal every `CLK_PERIOD/2` units of time, generating a square wave form. This is a fundamental block in digital systems applications for synchronization of actions."
