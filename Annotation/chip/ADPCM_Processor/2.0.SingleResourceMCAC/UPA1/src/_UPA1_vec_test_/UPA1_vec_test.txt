Module-level comment: The 'test' module functions as a test-bench for 'UPA1', cycling through various test scenarios defined by combinations of models, rates, operations, types, and laws. Inputs for 'UPA1' ('PK0','PK1','A1','SIGPK') are read from memory and outputs are validated against expected values, with errors flagged and described. This intricate testing process, orchestrated using several internal signals and arrays, ensures robust performance verification of 'UPA1' under different conditions.
