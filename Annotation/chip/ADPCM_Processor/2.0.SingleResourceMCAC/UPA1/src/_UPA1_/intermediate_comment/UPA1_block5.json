    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the control logic of the `UGA1` output based on the states of signal `SIGPK`, `PK0`, `PK1` and `PKS`. It works as a conditional module where `UGA1` obtains different values based on particular conditions. If both `SIGPK` and `PKS` signals are not present, `UGA1` is assigned a value of 192. If `SIGPK` is not present but `PKS` is, `UGA1` gets the value 65344. For all other scenarios, `UGA1` is reset to 0."
