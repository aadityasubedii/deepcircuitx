    "module": "Module-level comment: The UPA1 module performs custom arithmetic operations. It takes 'PK0', 'PK1', 'A1', and 'SIGPK' as inputs, applies complex bitwise operations and conditional assignments to compute intermediate results ('UGA1', 'PKS', 'A1S', 'ULA1', 'UA1'), and finally adds 'A1' and 'UA1' to yield output 'A1T'. The module also supports the scan-chain testing via 'scan_in' and 'scan_out' ports controlled by 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' flags. Accomplished through multiple blocks, each contributing to a step in the operation, this module completes a specialized mathematical function."
