It has provisions for resetting and initializing memory to either all zeroes or all ones based on the INITIALIZED_TO_ZERO parameter. When the write enable signal is high, it allows the user to write data byte-span wise into the SRAM at a specified address, according to the byte-enable signals. When the write signal is not enabled, it reads data from the specified SRAM address and puts it on the read data output."
