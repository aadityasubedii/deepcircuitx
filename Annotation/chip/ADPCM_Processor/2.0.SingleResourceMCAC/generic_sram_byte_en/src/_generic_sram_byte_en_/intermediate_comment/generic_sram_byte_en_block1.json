    "block_comment": "The block encapsulates a hardware memory unit, handling data writing and reading based on certain inputs and conditions. On reset, the code initializes the output read data and sets memory locations to zero or one based on the INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO flag. When not in reset, the output is assigned either a zero value (if write is enabled) or the data from a specified memory address. If writing is enabled, the code updates the particular byte of the memory address if the corresponding byte in byte_enable is set, otherwise, it retains the old value."
