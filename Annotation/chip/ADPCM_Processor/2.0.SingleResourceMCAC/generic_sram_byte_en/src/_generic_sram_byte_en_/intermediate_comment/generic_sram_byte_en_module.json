    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, generic_sram_byte_en, implements a parameterizable byte-enablable SRAM with wider data width. It provides read/write functionality based on enable signals and an options for memory initialization to all ones or all zeroes. The inputs encompass control signals, data, addresses, byte-enable lines and several debugging pins, whilst output presents read data from SRAM and debug information. The SRAM storage is internally maintained in 'mem' array. On each clock cycle, it checks for reset signal to initialize or write/read into the SRAM as per byte-enable signals. The byte-wise writing and reset functionality are implemented using two loop counters 'i' and 'j'."
