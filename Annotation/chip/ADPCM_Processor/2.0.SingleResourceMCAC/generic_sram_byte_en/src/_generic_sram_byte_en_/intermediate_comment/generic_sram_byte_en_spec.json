This SRAM module provides the functionality to either write to or read from the memory based on the enable signal. There is also a provision for resetting and initializing memory to either all zeroes or all ones based on the INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO parameter. \n\nThe module has several input controls, including the clk (clock signal), reset signal, i_write_data (data to be written to SRAM), i_write_enable (enables the write operation into the SRAM), i_address (memory address specifiers), i_byte_enable (byte-enable signals), test_mode, scan_enable, and scan_in(0 to 4) (used for debugging). The outputs include scan_out(0 to 4) (testing/debugging outputs) and o_read_data (output data from the SRAM).\n\nInternally the module contains an array named mem that acts as the physical representation of the SRAM. It can hold 2^ADDRESS_WIDTH number of data words where each word has a width defined by the DATA_WIDTH. There are also two loop counters i and j, used for manipulating byte-level operations and initializing/resetting memory contents respectively. \n\nThe module operation is divided into two main ranges, one concerning reset and initialization and the other pertaining to memory operations. When the reset signal is high, memory gets initialized to either all zeroes or all ones as per the INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO parameter using the 'j' loop counter internally. Memory operations occur when the clock signal is high. During memory operations, write or read is performed based on i_write_enable signal. When it is high, 'i' loop counter iterates over the bytes of a data word, writes data into the SRAM according to byte-enable signals (i_byte_enable). Conversely, when i_write_enable is low, data from the specified address is read and put into o_read_data.",
