    "module": "Module-level comment: This test module initializes and tracks the testbench of a 'generic_sram_byte_en' module called 'top'. Its implementation uses control signals like 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode', along with five scan inputs 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4'. Optional load of an SDF file is ensured with 'SDFSCAN'. It sets the simulation environment, initializes all signals to 0, and terminates the simulation after initial setup. This module essentially serves as a foundation for developing and potentially testing the 'generic_sram_byte_en'."
