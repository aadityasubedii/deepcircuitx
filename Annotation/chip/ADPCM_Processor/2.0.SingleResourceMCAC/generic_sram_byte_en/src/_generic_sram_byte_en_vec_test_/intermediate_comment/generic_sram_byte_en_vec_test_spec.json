    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe \"test\" module primarily operates as a testbench module for the \"generic_sram_byte_en\" module. It initiates and drives signals into the \"generic_sram_byte_en\" module including a clock signal 'clk', a reset signal 'reset', various scan signals ('scan_in0' to 'scan_in4'), a scan enable signal 'scan_enable' and a 'test_mode' signal. The module handles simulation specifics such as time format, and potentially handles gate-level simulation SDF annotations if 'SDFSCAN' flag is defined. \n\nThe module has no input ports. It has output signals - 'scan_out0', 'scan_out1', 'scan_out2', 'scan_out3' and 'scan_out4', which are scan output ports used for routing scan test data out of the 'generic_sram_byte_en' module to verify its functionality.\n\nThe internal signals used in this module include a clock 'clk' for synchronization, a 'reset' signal for initializing states, scan input signals ('scan_in0' to 'scan_in4') for transferring scan data into the 'generic_sram_byte_en' module, 'scan_enable' signal for allowing the flow of scan input signals, and 'test_mode' signal to enable the 'generic_sram_byte_en' module to operate in a testing mode.\n\nThe major blocks of the code include definition of signals, instantiation of the 'generic_sram_byte_en' module, an initial block for setting the time format, potentially defining SDF annotations for gate-level simulation and setting all internal signals to zero. The simulation ends after the initialization as a $finish command is issued immediately after initialization without any specified simulation runtime or test sequences. Therefore, the module is primed for testing purposes and does not contain functional code for a specific operation beyond initialization and possible annotation. \n\nThis 'test' module behaves primarily as a test environment or testbench to drive and observe signals for the 'generic_sram_byte_en' module and to potentially apply SDF annotations for gate-level simulation.",
