Module-level comment: "Test" is a testbench module, primarily driving signals into the "generic_sram_byte_en" module. Providing a clock, reset, scan inputs, a scan enable, and test mode signal. It may handle gate-level SDF annotations, only if 'SDFSCAN' is defined. An initial block sets the time format, primes all signals to zero, and finishes the simulation. The module's primary function is to initiate and observe the 'generic_sram_byte_en' module in a testing environment.
