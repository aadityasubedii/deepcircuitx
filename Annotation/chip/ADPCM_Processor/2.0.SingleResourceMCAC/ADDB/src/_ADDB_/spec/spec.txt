Module name: ADDB. 

Module specification: 

The ADDB module serves the purpose of conducting an arithmetic add operation between two given numbers. It uniquely processes two input numbers, DQ, a 16-bit input, and SE, a 15-bit input according to certain conditions before executing the addition operation. In addition, the module supports a scan testing system with scan_in and scan_out ports that are triggered in the test mode.

The ADDB module operates on several input ports namely reset, clk, scan_in0, scan_in1, scan_in2, scan_in3, scan_in4, scan_enable, test_mode, DQ, and SE. The reset and clk signals are used for initiating and controlling the clock pulses respectively. The scan_in signals, along with scan_enable and test_mode, are provided for enabling the scan test mode. DQ and SE are the two main data inputs to be manipulated and used for the succeeding addition operation.

The output ports include scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4, and SR. The scan_out ports are responsible for outputting the results from the scan testing, whilst SR stands as the endpoint for revealing the result of the performed addition.

Internally, the ADDB module utilizes four signals, namely DQS, SES, DQI, and SEI for processing the operation. Both DQS and SES employ selective bits from DQ and SE respectively. DQI and SEI are derived signals based on conditions checked on DQS and SES respectively.

The module operates in blocks where assign statements are used to compute internal and final results. DQS and SES select specific bits from DQ and SE inputs. Derived signals, DQI and SEI, are computed by processing DQ and SE through conditions checked on DQS and SES. Finally, the addition operation is executed on DQI and SEI to produce the sum 'SR', thereby completing the general feature of the ADDB module.
