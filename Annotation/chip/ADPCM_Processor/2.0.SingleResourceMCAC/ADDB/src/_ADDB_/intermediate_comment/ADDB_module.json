    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe ADDB module performs arithmetic addition on two numbers, specifically handling 16-bit and 15-bit inputs \u2013 DQ and SE. Internally, it employs exclusive bits of DQ and SE through signals DQS and SES. Based on conditions checked on these signals, it manipulates DQ and SE to derive necessary signals DQI and SEI. The final sum is computed on these derived signals, resulting in output SR. It also facilitates a scan testing function activated in test mode, managing control signals for enabling tests and relaying test results throughout scan_in and scan_out ports."
