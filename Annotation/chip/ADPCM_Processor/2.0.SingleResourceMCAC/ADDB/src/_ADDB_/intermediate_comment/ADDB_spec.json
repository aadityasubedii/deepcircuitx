    "spec": "Module name: ADDB. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe ADDB module serves the purpose of conducting an arithmetic add operation between two given numbers. It uniquely processes two input numbers, DQ, a 16-bit input, and SE, a 15-bit input according to certain conditions before executing the addition operation. In addition, the module supports a scan testing system with scan_in and scan_out ports that are triggered in the test mode.\n\nThe ADDB module operates on several input ports namely reset, clk, scan_in0, scan_in1, scan_in2, scan_in3, scan_in4, scan_enable, test_mode, DQ, and SE. The reset and clk signals are used for initiating and controlling the clock pulses respectively. The scan_in signals, along with scan_enable and test_mode, are provided for enabling the scan test mode. DQ and SE are the two main data inputs to be manipulated and used for the succeeding addition operation.\n\nThe output ports include scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4, and SR. The scan_out ports are responsible for outputting the results from the scan testing, whilst SR stands as the endpoint for revealing the result of the performed addition.\n\nInternally, the ADDB module utilizes four signals, namely DQS, SES, DQI, and SEI for processing the operation. Both DQS and SES employ selective bits from DQ and SE respectively. DQI and SEI are derived signals based on conditions checked on DQS and SES respectively.\n\nThe module operates in blocks where assign statements are used to compute internal and final results. DQS and SES select specific bits from DQ and SE inputs. Derived signals, DQI and SEI, are computed by processing DQ and SE through conditions checked on DQS and SES. Finally, the addition operation is executed on DQI and SEI to produce the sum 'SR', thereby completing the general feature of the ADDB module.",

DQ: 16-bit input signal for the addition operation.\n7. SE: 15-bit input signal for the addition operation.\n\nExplanation: The reset and clk signals are fundamental controls for any digital system. The scan_in signals along with scan_enable and test_mode signals are used for testing the module in scan mode. DQ and SE are the two data inputs for the addition operation, which are manipulated based on certain conditions within the module.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4: Output scan chain for testing.\n2. SR: 16-bit result of the addition operation.\n\nExplanation: The scan_out signals (scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4) provide the testing results when the module is in scan mode. SR is the final output of the module which holds the sum of the addition operation performed on the data inputs."

Specifically, it's the 16th bit of DQ. \n- SES: Similarly, this is a selective bit from the SE input signal, specifically it's the 15th bit of SE.\n- DQI: This signal is a derivation based on DQS and DQ. There is condition check on DQS. If DQS is '0', DQI is DQ. Otherwise, DQI is calculated by subtracting the smaller 15 bits of DQ from 65536.\n- SEI: This is another derivated signal from SES and SE. There is condition check on SES. If SES is '0', SEI is SE. Otherwise, SEI is SE added by 32768. \n\nTo summarize, these internal signals play a significant role in handling the conditions, modifying the inputs DQ and SE, and controlling the final addition operation. The manipulated inputs DQI and SEI are used for the final addition that results in the output SR. These signals aid in making the module flexible, maintaining a dynamic aspect depending on the individual bit values of the input signals."
