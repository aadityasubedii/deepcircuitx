    "module": "Module-level comment: This 'Test' module serves as a simulation environment initializing the 'ADDB top' module. It handles input/output signals required for scanning and testing features. Key inputs include the clock (clk), reset signal, scan inputs (scan_in0 - scan_in4), scan enable and test mode. Outputs are the scan outputs (scan_out0 - scan_out4). Internally, clock and reset signals synchronize operations, scan inputs process test data, scan enable controls scanning, while test_mode signal triggers test mode. Initial block sets time format, gives initial conditions for all signals and applies potential SDF annotations for timing accuracy."
