If `SDFSCAN` is defined, it applies Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotations to the design for more accurate timing simulation.

The scan_in signals are specific to this module and are probably used for some kind of data processing or logic operations. The scan_enable signal is most likely used to control whether the scan_in signals should be read or not.
