    "spec": "Module name: Test. \n\nModule specification: The 'Test' module in Verilog is primarily used for creating the environment for simulation and initialization. This module specifically initializes the \"ADDB top\" module, providing all of its necessary inputs and outputs. The inputs for this module are clk (clock signal), reset, scan_in0, scan_in1, scan_in2, scan_in3, scan_in4 (which are used for scanning inputs), scan_enable (to enable or disable scanning), and test_mode (which puts the module in testing mode). The outputs are scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4, which produce the outputs from the performed scan operation.\n\nInternally, the signals clk and reset provide time reference and initialization for synchronous operations. The scan_in signals are used for the scanning operation while the scan_enable signal indicates when the scanning should be performed. The test_mode signal initiates test mode in the circuit when necessary.\n\nThe code is organized into different blocks, most notably an initial block which sets the format for simulation time, applies possible Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotations, provides initial conditions for the signals, and terminates the simulation. The purpose of this Module is to establish the initial environment for the 'ADDB top' module, set the initial state, then provide simulation run-time commands, laying optimal conditions for running the module and ending the simulation once complete.",
