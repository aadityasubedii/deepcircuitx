    "block_comment": "This block primarily serves as the initialization process for a testbench. The code configures the display options to show simulation time in nanoseconds with a precision of two decimal places. If key 'SDFSCAN' is defined, it annotates the design timing information using an SDF file for the top module of the testbench. Additionally, it sets all signals (including clocks, reset, different scan inputs, scan enable, and test mode) to logic 0, effectively making these signals low or inactive at start up. The process is concluded with a $finish command that marks the end of the initialization."
