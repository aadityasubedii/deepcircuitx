It initializes numerous arrays (e.g. rates, laws, operations, types, models) that are used in various test scenarios. With the help of multiple nested loops, it covers multiple scenarios in which it feeds different combinations of inputs/data read from memory to the module under test. The outputs are then checked against the expected values also read from memory. Any discrepancy leads to an error message displaying the test number and the conditions under which the error occurred. Finally, it completes its operation by displaying \"TEST COMPLETE\" and terminates the simulation using $finish."
