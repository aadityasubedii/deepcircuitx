    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for creating a clock signal with `CLK_PERIOD` time period. It achieves this by making use of the `always` keyword which results in the continuous execution of the statements enclosed within this block. After every half of the `CLK_PERIOD`, the value of the clock signal is inverted (`~clk`) which creates an oscillating digital clock signal with a time-period of `CLK_PERIOD`. This ticking clock is essential for synchronization in digital circuit operations."
