    "spec": "Module name: `test`. \n\nModule specification: The `test` module is a test bench designed for a configuration module named `CFG_INT`. This module doesn't perform any specific processing but sets the environment to instantiate and initialize the `CFG_INT` module, adjusting the timing formats and applying SDF annotations if the `SDFSCAN` macro is defined.\n\nThe input ports of the module include the clock signal `clk`, reset signal `reset`, scan input signals `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`. The clock signal `clk` operates the module, while `reset` resets the state of the module. The scan input signals `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` likely contribute to scan-chain testing in the `CFG_INT` module. The `scan_enable` signal seems to allow the scan mode in the module, whereas `test_mode`, the last input, likely enables the test mode of the `CFG_INT` module.\n\nThe module also includes output ports: `scan_out0`, `scan_out1`, `scan_out2`, `scan_out3`, `scan_out4`. These are predicted to be scan output signals used for scan-chain testing in the `CFG_INT` module, possibly signaling the result of the testing phase.\n\nThe module uses a set of internal signals identical to its I/O ports (`clk`, `reset`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode`, `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`). They serve respective purposes based on their roles as inputs, outputs, or elements controlling the module's functionality.\n\nThe code segment consists of several sections: the instantiation of the `CFG_INT` module with appropriate mapping of I/O ports, an `initial` block setting up the system time format and the module's operational parameters, and an `ifdef` clause for optional SDF annotation.\n\nIn summary, the `test` module serves as an enabler and controller that configures and initializes the `CFG_INT` module for further operations, making it an essential entity for the `CFG_INT`'s testing procedure.",
