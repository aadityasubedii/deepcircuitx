    "block_comment": "This block starts an initial test configuration in a Verilog module. The time format for the simulation is first set, followed by optional System Delay Format (SDF) annotation, which applies only if the SDFSCAN flag is defined. This block then initializes some input signals (clk, reset, scan inputs, scan_enable, and test_mode) to the value zero, thereby setting the system to known state. It concludes the block by calling the `$finish` command, which terminates the simulation after this initial setup."
