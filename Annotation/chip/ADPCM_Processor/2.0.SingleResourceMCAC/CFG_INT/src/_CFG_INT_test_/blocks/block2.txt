Comment: 
This block of Verilog code checks for data integrity by comparing the output from the wishbone bus 'o_wb_dat_d' with a trusted data 'truth_data_test_d'. If these two pieces of data mismatch, the system flags an error with a detailed message showing the current time, expected data and actual data retrieved from the bus. An additional macro '`ifdef ERRORSTOP' halts the system when such error occurs, effectively serving as extra caution for critical operations where data integrity is paramount.
