Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for setting control signals to low at a positive edge of the clock cycle. On every rising edge of the clock, the 'i_wb_we_e', 'i_wb_cyc_e', and 'i_wb_stb_e' signals are reset to zero. These signals are likely used for controlling certain operations in a write back stage of a processor, with these signals possibly driving write enable, cycle, and strobe control bits respectively.
