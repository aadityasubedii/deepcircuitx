    "block_comment": "The block of code corresponds to a task that writes data to a specific address in a Wishbone (wb) bus using Edge-triggered methodology. The data and address are passed as inputs to the task. At the beginning of the first clock edge, the variables i_wb_adr_e, i_wb_cyc_e, i_wb_stb_e, i_wb_we_e, and i_wb_dat_e get updated with the provided address, the signal indicating valid data cycle, the signal designating valid data strobe, write enable signal, and the data to be written respectively. Signals remain high during the clock cycle and the data is written to the address. On the next clock edge, the variables i_wb_we_e, i_wb_cyc_e, and i_wb_stb_e are reset indicating the end of the write operation."
