    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code writes test data into the Wishbone bus. Upon the positive edge of the clock, it sets the write address (wb_waddress_test_e), write-cycle (i_wb_cyc_e), strobe (i_wb_stb_e), and a write enabling bit (i_wb_we_e), all to '1'. At the same time, it transfers the test data (wb_data_test_e) into the Wishbone bus write data. This operation effectively signifies a continuous write operation to the specified address with the given test data."
