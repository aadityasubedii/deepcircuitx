    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a testbench simulating a system composed of an encoder and decoder. It initializes and manipulates various signals for checking the functionality of the underlying modules. First, initial conditions are set, along with time format and optional SDF annotation. Resets and clock cycling are managed accordingly. Then it performs a series of operations by writing random data to decoder, encoder units, and verifying the obtained result. Flags and data are made to interact with the registers. It injects random data via 'ws', 'addrs', and 'w_data' and checks results at 'r_data' and 'data_check'. Random addresses are generated for storing and checking the functionality. It then checks for discrepancies, and if any, the Decoder/Encoder Error is displayed with detailed failure info, and optionally halts the program based on \"ERRORSTOP\". Finally, the decoder and encoder cores are verified if they are ready, and the test completes. If there are any discrepancies in the core readiness, it's being reported, otherwise, successful handshake messages are displayed."
