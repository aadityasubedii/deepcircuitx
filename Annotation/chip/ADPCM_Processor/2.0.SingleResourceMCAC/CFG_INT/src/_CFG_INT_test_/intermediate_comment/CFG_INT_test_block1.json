    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a write operation to the Wishbone bus. Upon the rising edge of the clock signal, it assigns the write address and data to respective components of the bus and sets the write enable (`i_wb_we_d`), cycle (`i_wb_cyc_d`), and strobe (`i_wb_stb_d`) signals to high (asserted), triggering the write operation. In the next clock cycle, it deasserts these signals, indicating the end of the write operation."
