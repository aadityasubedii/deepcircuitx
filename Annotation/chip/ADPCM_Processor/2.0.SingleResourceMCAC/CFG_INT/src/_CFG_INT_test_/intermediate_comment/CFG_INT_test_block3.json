    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a synchronous reset for the two signals `i_wb_cyc_d` and `i_wb_stb_d` on the rising edge (posedge) of the clock signal `clk`. It follows a standard pattern for initializing or resetting sequential logic in synchronous digital systems, where actions take place at discrete clock events. Specifically, this reset block sets the `i_wb_cyc_d` and `i_wb_stb_d` signals to zero each time there is a rising clock edge."
