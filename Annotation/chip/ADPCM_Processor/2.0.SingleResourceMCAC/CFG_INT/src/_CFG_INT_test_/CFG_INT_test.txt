Module-level comment: The 'test' module is designed as a comprehensive testbench for the 'CFG_INT' module of an FPGA/ASIC device. It operates by creating various signals as inputs to the 'CFG_INT' module, testing its functionality under different scenarios including normal and test modes, checking the results against expected outputs, and by controlling encoder and decoder modules via Wishbone bus. The module also generates random test cases, and error messages if discrepancies occur. Input/output ports include control signals, data and address buses, and Wishbone interface signals. The module uses loop variables, data check variables, random number generators, and internal registers for its operation.
