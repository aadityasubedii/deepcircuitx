As provided, the Verilog code snippet "`timescale 1ns / 1ps" does not define a module, its functionality, or any input/output ports. Therefore, it is impossible to generate a detailed specification of a module from the provided snippet. The "`timescale" directive only specifies the time unit and time precision for simulations of Verilog designs in the current file.

To provide a comprehensive module specification, we would need a complete piece of Verilog code defining a module, its functionality, inputs, and outputs. Please provide the requested information to proceed.
