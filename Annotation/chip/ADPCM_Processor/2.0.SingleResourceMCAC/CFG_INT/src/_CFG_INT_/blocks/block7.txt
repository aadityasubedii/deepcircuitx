Comment: 
The block of code is a reset and configuration mechanism for the encoder and decoder. The logic is executed at every positive edge of write clock or reset signal. If the reset is activated, it resets the encoder and decoder channels (enc_ch and dec_ch) back to '0', indicating an unconfigured state. When the device is not in reset, the block configures the encoder or decoder channel addressed by 'addrs[4:0]' with 'w_data[2:0]', setting the corresponding bit in the encoder_configured or decoder_configured register to '1'.
