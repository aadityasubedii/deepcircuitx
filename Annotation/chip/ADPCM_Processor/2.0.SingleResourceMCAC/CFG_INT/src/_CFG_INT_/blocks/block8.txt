This block is a conditional clock signal generator. The block computes the `write_clk` signal, which will be utilized as the clocking signal in the system. When `test_mode` signal is asserted i.e., high, the system clock `clk` is forwarded directly to `write_clk`. Otherwise, the inverse of the logical AND operation between `cs` (chip select) and `ws` (write select) signals is forwarded. Notably, this construct enables the flexibility of switching between normal and testing modes of operation in the system.
