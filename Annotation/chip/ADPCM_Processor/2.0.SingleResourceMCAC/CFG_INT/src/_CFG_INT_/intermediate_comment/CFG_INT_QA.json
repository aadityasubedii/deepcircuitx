Within this module there are mechanisms for configuring encoder and decoder channels, tracking readiness status, and interfacing with other components via a wishbone protocol. This is achieved with a combination of clocked registers and combinational logic. There are also provisions for testing mode and scan enabling. The module interacts with the wider systems via two wishbone buses, denoted as \"e\" and \"d\". The operation of these buses follows the standard wishbone protocol.
