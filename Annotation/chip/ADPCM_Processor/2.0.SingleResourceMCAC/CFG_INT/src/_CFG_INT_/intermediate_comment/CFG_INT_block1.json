    "block_comment": "This block is a combination of sequential and combinational logic, controlled by the rising edge of the clock signal (clk), or in the event of a reset signal. If a reset event occurs, the block deactivates all output flags and clears the output data to default states. When operating normally, this block examines the address sent to it (i_wb_adr_d) for specific values, and if they are hit it changes the value in buffer_1 and buffer_2 as a response and activates certain flags (dec_ready_for_data, o_wb_ack_d, wb_ack2_d). If a write enable is asserted, the block checks for a specific address hit (CONFIG_CORE_READY) and activates the flag dec_ready_for_data. If there is a read enable, buffer_2's value is pushed onto the output output data register (o_wb_dat_d) and the read request flag is activated."
