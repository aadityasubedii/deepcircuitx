    "block_comment": "This line of code sets the Wishbone error signal, `o_wb_err_e`, to 0. The assign keyword in Verilog is used to create combinational logic and is generally used for continuous data assignments. The `1'b0` is a binary notation to represent the number `0`. here, the single output bit `o_wb_err_e` is permanently assigned to '0' indicating there's no error in the Wishbone bus protocol communication. Hence, the code indicates that no error condition is currently detected on the Wishbone interface."
