    "module": "Module-level comment: The CFG_INT module is an interface for configuring encoder/decoder channels, and enables interfacing via a wishbone protocol. It uses internal signals and arrays for configuration, readiness status, and data buffer. Input/Output ports include wishbone control and data signals, read/write data bus, read/write/chip select signals, scan and test mode signals. Functionality is achieved through distinct blocks for read and write operations, acknowledgment mechanism, and testing mode mechanism in the code."
