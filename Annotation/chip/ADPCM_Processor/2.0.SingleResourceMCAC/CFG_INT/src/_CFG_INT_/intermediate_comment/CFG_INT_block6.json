    "block_comment": "The block assigns a certain value to the signal 'wb_ack1_e'. The value assigned is dependent on the input 'i_wb_we_e'. If 'i_wb_we_e' is true, the value assigned is the logical AND of 'i_wb_stb_e' and 'i_wb_cyc_e'; if 'i_wb_we_e' is false, the value assigned is the logical AND of 'i_wb_stb_e', 'i_wb_cyc_e', and 'start_read_e'. This block of code controls the generation of a write or read acknowledge signal, based on the write enable input and the write/read strobes."
