Module name: CFG_INT. 

Module specification: The CFG_INT module is a configurable interface used as part of a larger digital system. Its functionality involves configuring encoder and decoder channels, tracking readiness status, facilitating interface with other components via a wishbone protocol, and providing a testing mode. 

The module has multiple input and output ports. The inputs include reset and main clock (clk) signals, scanning/testing mechanism signals (scan_in0 to scan_in4 and scan_enable), a mode selector (test_mode), and Wishbone control and data signals `i_wb_adr_e, i_wb_sel_e, i_wb_we_e, i_wb_dat_e, i_wb_cyc_e, i_wb_stb_e, i_wb_adr_d, i_wb_sel_d, i_wb_we_d, i_wb_dat_d, i_wb_cyc_d, i_wb_stb_d`. Ports specific to memory operations include read-enable (rs), write-enable (ws) and chip select (cs) signals, write data bus (w_data) and address bus (addrs). The output ports include scanning mechanisms (scan_out0 to scan_out4), read data bus (r_data) and Wishbone control signals `o_wb_dat_e, o_wb_ack_e, o_wb_err_e, o_wb_dat_d, o_wb_ack_d, o_wb_err_d`.

Internally, the module employs several signals for its functionality such as `encoder_configured, decoder_configured, enc_ready_for_data, dec_ready_for_data` showing configuration status and readiness of encoder and decoder. Arrays `enc_ch` and `dec_ch` represent specific configurations for encoder and decoder channels whilst `buffer_1` to `buffer_4` are used for temporarily storing data. Signals `wb_ack2_e, wb_ack2_d, wb_ack1_e, wb_ack1_d` are used in the Wishbone acknowledgment mechanism and `start_read_e, start_read_d` serve as control signals. 

The Verilog code can be divided into sections dealing with read operations, write operations, and Wishbone bus control. The read operation block deals with address decoding and data retrieval; the write operation block handles configuration of encoder and decoder channels. The Wishbone control allows for read and write operations, and it also sets up acknowledgment and error checking processes. Additionally, the module uses mechanisms for entering/exiting testing modes.
