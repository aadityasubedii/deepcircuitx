    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to generate a system clock signal. The code uses a preprocessor macro (`SYS_CLK_PERIOD`) to define the half-period of the clock signal, essentially creating a square wave signal with the given period. This is implemented as an 'always' block, which toggles the state of the 'clk' signal every half period of the system clock."
