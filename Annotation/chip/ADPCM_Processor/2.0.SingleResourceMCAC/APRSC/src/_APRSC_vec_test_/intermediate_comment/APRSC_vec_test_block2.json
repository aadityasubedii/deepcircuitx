    "block_comment": "The block implements a task called \"wb_write_strobe\" that initiates a write operation to a Wishbone bus interface. Upon a positive edge of `clk`, the task sets `i_wb_adr` and `i_wb_dat` with the write address (`wb_waddress_test`) and the data (`wb_data_test`) respectively. In the same cycle, it then asserts the `i_wb_cyc`, `i_wb_stb`, and `i_wb_we` to activate the writing operation. In the following clock cycle, the block also ensures the termination of the writing process by deactivating `i_wb_we`, `i_wb_cyc`, and `i_wb_stb`. Hence, the task ensures an accurate timing protocol for write operations."
