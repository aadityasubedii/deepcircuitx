The module duplicates system conditions, initializes inputs, toggles them as required, and checks for expected output. It makes extensive use of tasks to write to and read from various register addresses (using Wishbone bridge), and compares the output with expected results. The module also features an extensive nested loop that simulates different system states by generating various stimuli. This is used to ensure the system is functioning as intended under different conditions. It also features the ability to import predefined vectors for the testing process."
