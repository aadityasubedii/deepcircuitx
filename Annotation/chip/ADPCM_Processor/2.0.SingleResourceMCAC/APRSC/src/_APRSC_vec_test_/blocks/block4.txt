Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is responsible for generating a clock signal used for the Co-Processor (represented by the signal 'CoPrclk'). The block does this by flipping the value of the CoPrclk signal every half of the Co-Processor period, creating a square wave signal with a frequency of 1/(`CO_PROC_PERIOD`), effectively accomplishing the function of a clock generator.
