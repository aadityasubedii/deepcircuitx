The block is responsible for generating and controlling the Wishbone read strobe sequence. The task takes three arguments: a 32-bit address, a boolean variable to check for the correct data, and a 32-bit truth-data for comparison. On the rising edge of the clock, it sets the Wishbone address, cycle, and strobe lines high, with the write enable line low, indicating a read operation. On the next two clock cycles, it clears the cycle and strobe lines. Then, it verifies whether the data on the Wishbone bus matches the expected truth data, and if not, it displays the error. If ERRORSTOP is defined, it stops the execution. In essence, this task simulates a read operation and checks if the data read is the same as the expected value.
