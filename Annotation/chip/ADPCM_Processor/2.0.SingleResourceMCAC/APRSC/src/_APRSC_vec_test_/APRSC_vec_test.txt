Module-level comment: 
/*
 * This testbench module verifies the APRSC system by simulating various operation conditions.
 * It uses nested loops to test different combinations of models, rates, operations, types, and laws.
 * The module interacts with the APRSC system via Wishbone bus protocol, writing inputs and reading outputs.
 * It compares actual outputs with expected results stored in pre-defined vectors.
 * The testbench also handles null vector cases and uses tasks for Wishbone read/write operations.
