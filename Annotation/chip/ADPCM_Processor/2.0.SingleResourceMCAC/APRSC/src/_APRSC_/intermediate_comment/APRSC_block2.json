    "block_comment": "This module performs a digital systems reset and describes a two-clock cycle latency storage procedure. During a reset, it sets all registers and wires to default values. If not in reset, it updates selected signals with a latency of two clock cycles, buffered by intermediate signals, ensuring sequential logic integrity. It also includes conditional statements and switches for specific memory address modifications, allowing data I/O operations via a Wishbone bus interface. Specific addresses trigger certain actions such as read, write, or request operations, or updating output values. The code ensures the correct sequential order of operations and manages possible data transmissions within a network, interfacing with a memory block."
