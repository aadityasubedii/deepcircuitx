    "block_comment": "This block of code governs the transition of 'pulseDelay' and 'pulseDelay1' signals. On each positive trigger of 'CoPrclk_int' clock signal or 'reset', it checks the 'reset' value and 'a2p_read' control flag to update the states of the mentioned signals. If 'reset' is high, both 'pulseDelay' and 'pulseDelay1' are reset to zero. If 'a2p_read' is high, 'pulseDelay1' is set to one and 'pulseDelay' takes the value of 'pulseDelay1'. Otherwise, both 'pulseDelay' and 'pulseDelay1' are reset to zero."
