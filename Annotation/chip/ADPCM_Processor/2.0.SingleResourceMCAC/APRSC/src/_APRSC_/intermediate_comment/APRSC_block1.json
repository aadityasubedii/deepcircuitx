    "block_comment": "This block controls a \"read_done\" signal based on system reset and Wishbone bus interface conditions in a synchronous digital system. The block is sensitive to the positive edges of the reset and clk_inv signals. If the system is reset, the \"read_done\" signal is immediately set to 1. In absence of a reset, the \"read_done\" signal's value depends on the Wishbone strobe (i_wb_stb) and cycle (i_wb_cyc) lines. If these lines are both active, indicating the presence of a valid data cycle, \"read_done\" is set to 0 to show that reading is in progress. Otherwise, it is set to 1, indicating the end of reading."
