This block is a sequential logic block that handles reset and request signal propagation. On either positive edge of CoPrclk_int clock signal or a high-level reset signal, the block takes action. In case of reset, it initializes req1 and req2 to zero ensuring a known good state. In normal operation, it shifts the value of req (a request) to req1 in the next clock cycle, and the value of req1 to req2, effectively creating a 2-stage request signal pipeline.
