Module name: APRSC. Module specification: The APRSC module is a complex digital signal processing unit designed for audio processing applications. It interfaces with a Wishbone bus for control and data transfer, processing input signals through multiple stages including floating-point operations, trigonometric functions, and MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) operations. The module has input ports for system reset, clocks, scan chain inputs, test functionality, and Wishbone bus signals, while output ports include scan chain outputs and Wishbone bus response signals. Internal signals are used for peak detection, XOR operations, shift registers, and various processing paths (A and B paths). The module is structured with several sub-modules and blocks, including ADDC, DELAY, FLOATB, FLOATA, UPA1, LIMD, TRIGB, UPB, XOR, and FMULT_ACCUM, each performing specific signal processing
