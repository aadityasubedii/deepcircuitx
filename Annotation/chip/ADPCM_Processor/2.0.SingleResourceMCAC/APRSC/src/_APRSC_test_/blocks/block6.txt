Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for resetting the write-back cycle flag (i_wb_cyc) and the write-back strobe flag (i_wb_stb) on the rising edge of the clock cycle (posedge clk). The flags are designed to signal specific actions or events in a larger system. Here, they are set to a value of '0' indicating their respective events, the write-back cycle, and the write-back strobe are not occurring or are inactive. The '<=' operator is used for non-blocking assignments, a characteristic feature of Verilog that allows simultaneous updates.
