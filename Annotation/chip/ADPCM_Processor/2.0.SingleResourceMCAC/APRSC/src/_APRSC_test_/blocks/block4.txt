This block performs a Wishbone read operation on a test address and compares the output with an expected output. It first asserts wishbone signals (`i_wb_cyc` and `i_wb_stb`) while passing the test address (`wb_address_test`) and deasserts `i_wb_we` signal to indicate a read operation. On the next clock cycle, it deasserts the `i_wb_cyc` and `i_wb_stb` signals to indicate the end of the operation. If `check_for_truth` is enabled, it verifies the output data (`o_wb_dat`) against the expected data (`truth_data_test`) and raises an error message with timestamp if mismatched and can terminate the program if `ERRORSTOP` macro is defined.
