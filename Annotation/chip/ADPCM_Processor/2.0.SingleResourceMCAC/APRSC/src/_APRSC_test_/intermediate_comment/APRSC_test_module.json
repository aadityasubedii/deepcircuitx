    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"test\" module serves as a test bed for the APRSC unit through various scenarios, validating its algorithmic and functional correctness. It leverages an interface with the standard Wishbone bus for data read/write operations. Key inputs like scan signals, test mode, reset, and bus controls guide the operations. Output ports reflect the test results and bus state. Internal signalling manages test environments and stores values read from memory. The code, split into sections like parameter initialization, clock signal creation, memory reads, Wishbone interface communication, etc., work in unison to implement the test process."
