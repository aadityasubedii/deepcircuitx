    "block_comment": "This block tests the validity of the 'o_wb_dat' signal against a predefined 'truth_data_test'. The block assigns 'o_wb_dat' to 'sr' and checks for consistency with the truth test data. If the data doesn't match, it prints an error message with the current simulation time, the expected truth data, and the actual output data. Depending on the ERRORSTOP flag, the simulation might also stop when an error is detected."
