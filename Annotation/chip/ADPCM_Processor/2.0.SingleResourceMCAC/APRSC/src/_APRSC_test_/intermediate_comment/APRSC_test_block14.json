    "block_comment": "The block serves as a task for a write operation for a Wishbone bus interface. This interface includes signals such as write data, write address, cycle/strobe signals, and a write enable. On a clock's positive edge, it sets the write address(i_wb_adr) and write data(i_wb_dat) using the provided parameters, wb_waddress_test and wb_data_test respectively. It also sets the cycle(i_wb_cyc), strobe(i_wb_stb), and write enable(i_wb_we) signals to 1 to initiate a write operation. On the next posedge of the clock, it resets write enable, cycle, and strobe signals to 0, signalling the end of the write cycle."
