    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the testing of a wishbone interface by writing test addresses during each clock cycle. Upon detection of a clock's positive edge, the code assigns the test address to `i_wb_adr` and sets the control signals `i_wb_cyc` and `i_wb_stb` to 1, initiating a new bus cycle and generating a strobe signal respectively. However, the write enable signal `i_wb_we` is set to 0, meaning no new data is written to the bus. In the next detected clock cycle, it then resets `i_wb_cyc` and `i_wb_stb`, ending the current bus cycle and disabling the strobe signal respectively."
