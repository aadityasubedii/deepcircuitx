    "block_comment": "This block initializes several arrays used to define specific system parameters. The 'rates' array specifies the rate values. The 'laws' array categorizes different types of laws. The 'operations' array defines operation types. The 'types' array classifies types of operations, and the 'models' array distinguishes between encoding and decoding. These arrays are initialized during the initial elaboration and simulation of the module, setting a baseline of available system parameters."
