    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a clock signal with a period defined by `SYS_CLK_PERIOD`. The always construct is used here to create a continuous loop, which toggles the clock signal (`clk = ~clk`) every half (`/2`) of the system's clock period (`SYS_CLK_PERIOD`), thereby achieving the functionality of a clock generator."
