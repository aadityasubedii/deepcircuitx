    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is primarily responsible for enabling and managing the Value Change Dump (VCD) for an Amber processor in a testbench environment. Initially, the system displays the duration of the VCD dump which is set by `AMBER_DUMP_START` and `AMBER_DUMP_LENGTH`. After this, the VCD dump file (`AMBER_VCD_FILE`) is defined, and then dumping of various important variables, including clock count and state of different stages of the processor pipeline i.e., fetch, decode, execute (along with details about register bank and operation parameters), cache, interface, amber unit, etc., is initiated. If the Amber A25 core is in use, memory unit and DCache variables are also dumped. Eventually, the dump is turned off after recording all changes."
