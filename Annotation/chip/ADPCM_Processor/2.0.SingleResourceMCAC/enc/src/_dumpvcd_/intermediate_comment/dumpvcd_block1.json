    "block_comment": "This block controls how and when the simulation data gets dumped. The dump process is triggered on the rising edge of U_DECOMPILE.i_clk. When the U_DECOMPILE clock count hits 10 or (`AMBER_DUMP_START + 0`), the dump process starts and a message is displayed, indicating the dump start tick count. Conversely, when the clock count is 20 or (`AMBER_DUMP_START + AMBER_DUMP_LENGTH`), the dump process halts and a message indicating the dump stop tick count is shown. Finally, if AMBER_TERMINATE is defined, an automatic termination of the test occurs when the clock count reaches (`AMBER_DUMP_START + AMBER_DUMP_LENGTH + 100`), and a termination message is displayed."
