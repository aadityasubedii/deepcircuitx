Its main function is to monitor signals and values in a simulation and record any changes to a VCD file. This file can then be used with a waveform viewer to analyze the behavior of a design at specific moments in time. The module uses system-defined variables related to the simulation cycle to decide when to dump these signal changes. It can switch the dumping on and off at certain points in the simulation, as determined by predefined variables (e.g., `AMBER_DUMP_START`, `AMBER_DUMP_LENGTH`). Additionally, it supports conditional compilation, meaning that certain parts of the code are only compiled and run if specific flags (e.g., `AMBER_DUMP_VCD`, `AMBER_A25_CORE`, `AMBER_TERMINATE`) are defined."
