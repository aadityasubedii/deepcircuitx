    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'dumpvcd' module acts as a debugging instrument that generates a Value Change Dump (VCD) file from simulation data, capturing changes in various signals. It employs hierarchical signals linked to 'Execute', 'Decompile', and other functional modules rather than explicit I/O ports. Conditional compilation and system-defined variables keyed to simulation cycles enable or disable data dumping and control test termination. It consists of an initial block preparing for simulation and an always block for on-the-clock operation with defined control points for logging and termination."
