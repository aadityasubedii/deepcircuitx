This block is an initialization module meant to establish the initial state of various testing and scanning parameters in a digital logic system. It sets test_mode, scan_enable, and the scan inputs to 0. It also uses a system reset (sysrst) signal that initially set to 0, switched to 1 after the first clock edge detect, and following a designated number of clock cycles (`RESET_TICKS), reset to 0 to revert the system to its initial state.
