This block of code primarily handles the loading of main memory from a specified file, with different behaviors based on whether the platform is a Xilinx FPGA or not. The procedure begins with resetting memory, followed by waiting for DDR3 initialization, if applicable. The code then opens the specified file, reads its content line by line, validates formatted lines to ensure they start with specified values, and accordingly updates the memory either to DDR3 or to RAM based on the build configuration. The code meticulously handles input errors and provides verbose output for debugging purposes. Any error during this process triggers an error message, providing the user with clear information about the malfunction. User-definable debug flags are used to control the verbosity of the output during the memory loading process.
