The function 'insert_32_into_128' inserts a 32-bit word into a specified location within a 128-bit word. This function manages insertion based on the positional input ranging from 0 to 3. Through a case statement in Verilog, the 32-bit input ('word32') is injected at the required position into a 128-bit word ('word128'), by precisely substituting the corresponding location in the original 128-bit value with the 32-bit input. The modified 128-bit word is then returned as output.
