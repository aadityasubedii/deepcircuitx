    "module": "Module-level comment: \nThe 'tb' module is a testbench for stimulating, verifying and testing the Amber Core System. It initializes and manages system test environment, multiple clock signals, memory files (both main and boot memories), and directs different test modes. Internal signals control sub-modules interactions. It includes specific setups for Xilinx FPGA families and features robust error detection and logging functionalities. Timeouts are set for tests to ensure finite execution. The design is modular, with clear division and encapsulation of functionalities, enabling easy adjustment in the testbench system."
