    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a clock frequency divider. In each positive edge of the system clock (`U_SYSTEM.sys_clk`), it increments the `clk_count` variable by one. The `clk_count` represents the number of clock cycles that have occurred since the system was powered up or reset. The block serves as a counter in digital systems for tracking the number of clock cycles."
