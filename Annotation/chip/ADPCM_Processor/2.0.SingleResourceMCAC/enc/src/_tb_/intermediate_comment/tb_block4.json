    "block_comment": "This block primarily functions as a test status display and logging subsystem for a testbench. This part of the code is activated whenever any test_status_set or testfail conditions are met. It checks the value of test_status_reg flag and accordingly dispatches test status messages to stdout and a log file. If the test is successful, it displays and logs a success message with the test name and the number of clock cycles it consumed. Conversely, if the test fails, it will not only display and log a failure message with the test name, but also print respective error details such as error code or the line number where the error occurred."
