    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the loading of boot memory from a specific file for a hardware simulation. Initially, the system waits for a reset, then attempts to open the boot memory file. It iterates through each line of the file, each line is aligned, and error checking is performed on the format of the lines, specifically, checking how the line starts. If valid, hexadecimal numbers are converted into 32-bits and loaded into the corresponding memory address. Specific processes are executed depending on the core used. Finally, a log file is opened for logging purposes. If the script fails to open the boot memory file, it triggers an error message and ends the simulation. Statistics on the number of lines read, core type, log file, test name, and timeout values are displayed at the end."
