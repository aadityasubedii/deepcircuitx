    "block_comment": "This block of codes performs the function of displaying the values of registers in the Amber Core model. Within the task `display_registers`, the code begins with a case statement based on the bit mode status of the execution unit in Amber Core. This determines the output line that indicates which mode is currently active: User, FIRQ, IRQ, or SVC. Following this, it prints out the hexadecimal values of several registers (r0-r15), including special cases for r13 and r14 which have separate values for each mode. Lastly, it prints the status bits and status bit masks for IRQ and FIRQ, and the current mode's identifying name."
