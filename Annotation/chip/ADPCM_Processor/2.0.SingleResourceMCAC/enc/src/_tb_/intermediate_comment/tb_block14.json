    "block_comment": "This initial block generates a clock signal of frequency 533MHz. It initializes the clock signal 'clk_533mhz' to 0 at the beginning. Then it employs a forever loop to continuously invert the signal with a delay of 938 time units (where time unit is already specified in the testbench), generating a clock signal with the desired frequency."
