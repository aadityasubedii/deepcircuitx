Module-level comment: /* This testbench module verifies an encoder/decoder system's functionality. It initializes the system, loads memory, generates test vectors, applies stimuli, and checks outputs. The module uses clock generation, memory interfacing, and signal monitoring to simulate various operational scenarios. It includes error checking and result reporting mechanisms to validate the system's behavior under different configurations and input conditions. */
