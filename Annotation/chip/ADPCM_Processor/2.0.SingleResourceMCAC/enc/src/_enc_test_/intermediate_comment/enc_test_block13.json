    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a clock cycle counter. At every rising edge of the system clock, indicated by the posedge `U_SYSTEM.clk`, the counter `clk_count` increments by one. This counting procedure effectively allows for the tracking of the number of elapsed clock cycles."
