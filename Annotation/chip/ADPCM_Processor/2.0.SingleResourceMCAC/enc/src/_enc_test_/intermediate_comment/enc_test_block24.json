    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the least significant 32 bits of the `o_wb_dat_d` data bus to the most significant 32 bits of the same data bus. This operation is done using the `assign` command and bitwise index slicing in Verilog, which allows specifying a range of bits from a bus, where the least significant bit is indexed as 0, and the most significant bit is indexed based on the size of the bus - 1."
