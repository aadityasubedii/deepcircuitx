    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for loading the main memory from a file at a specified location. Upon detection of a reset condition, the block waits for a number of clock ticks to initialize the memory loading process. It opens the file designated by `MAIN_MEM_FILE`, and reads each line of it while the file remains open and each fgets operation is successful. For every line read, a check is performed to ensure specific patterns and formats, ignoring any comment line (start with '//') and raising a format error if necessary. It calculates memory addresses and data, and inserts data into the 128-bit memory of the `U_RAM` instance at the corresponding memory address. It provides debugging information as per the `AMBER_LOAD_MEM_DEBUG` directive. The process concludes with a display of the total number of lines read."
