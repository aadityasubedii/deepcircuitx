    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a serial counter with reset functionality. It uses a clock signal to regulate its operations. On every positive edge of the clock, if the 'reset' is high, the signals 'enc_s_clk' and 'ser_count' are set to '0'. However, if 'ser_count' is not equal to '8'h3B', 'ser_count' is incremented by 1 and 'enc_s_clk' retains its value. Once 'ser_count' becomes equal to '8'h3B', it is reset to '0' and 'enc_s_clk' is toggled."
