    "block_comment": "The function `insert_32_into_128` modifies a 128-bit word by inserting a 32-bit word at a specific location. Positions for the 32-bit insertion are determined by the `pos` input, which can range from 0 to 3. To accommodate the new word, data is shifted right, with the amount of shift depending on the given `pos`. For `pos=0`, the 32-bit word replaces the least significant 32 bits. For `pos=1`, the 32-bit word is inserted after the least significant 32 bits; for `pos=2`, it is inserted after the least significant 64 bits; and for `pos=3`, it replaces the most significant 32 bits. The function uses a case statement to control the insertion process."
