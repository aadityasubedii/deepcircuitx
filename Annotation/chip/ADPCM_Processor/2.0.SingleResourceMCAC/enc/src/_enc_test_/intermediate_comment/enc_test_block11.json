    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block acts as a sequencer for test scenarios in a verification bench. It captures input data on rising edges of reset and falling edges of the clock, enc_o_clk, and resets previous and captured data if reset or no program start. After reset, it uses a delay counter to ensure the start of data capture. It then sequentially stores the encoded output (enc_o) data based on the channel and bit count, and increments the test count when a complete bitstream is captured or when all channels are analyzed. It also checks the captured data with expected data and if a mismatch is detected, an error message is displayed. Additionally, the module frequently prints out the test progress and declares completion once test count exceeds certain threshold."
