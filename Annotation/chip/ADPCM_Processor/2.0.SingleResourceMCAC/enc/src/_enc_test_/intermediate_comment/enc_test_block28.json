    "block_comment": "This block performs a memory transfer operation. It uses a generate statement to create a memory copy operation, where it assigns values from a specific portion of the 'test.u_main_mem.ram' array to the 'memory' array. This copying process begins from the 2100th index of the 'test.u_main_mem.ram' array and covers 501 elements, transferring them into respective indices of the 'memory' array. This transfer operation is achieved through an iterative process (controlled by the 'for' loop) that steps through the arrays from index 0 to 500."
