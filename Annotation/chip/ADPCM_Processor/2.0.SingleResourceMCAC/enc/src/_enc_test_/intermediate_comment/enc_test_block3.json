    "block_comment": "This block of code is a system timeout error handler. Operating synchronously with the system clock, it checks if a timeout value is set to nonzero and whether the clock count exceeds this timeout. If these conditions hold, it displays a timeout error and instructs to edit a specific file to change the timeout value, along with potentially invoking a testbench error message in non-netlist scenarios."
