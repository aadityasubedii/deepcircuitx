    "block_comment": "This block of code performs bit-wise copying operation in a wirebus. Specifically, it copies the value of the least significant 32 bits (from bit 0 to bit 31) of the wirebus o_wb_dat_e and assigns them to the most significant 32 bits (from bit 127 to bit 96) of the same wirebus. Thus, effectively mirroring the value of the least significant 32 bits into the most significant bits, allowing duplication of data within the wirebus as required."
