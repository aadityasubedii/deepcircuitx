    "block_comment": "This block functions as a test execution status reporter in a simulation environment. Upon a test status being set or a test failure occurring, it determines whether a test has passed or failed, and proceeds accordingly. If the status register value is 17 and no test failure has occurred, it indicates a passed test by displaying registers, printing a message to the terminal and writing it to a log file. Any other conditions mean a test failure - the block will display registers, print an appropriate message about failure reason (based on the test status register value) to the terminal and write it to a log file as well. After each case, it finishes the simulation."
