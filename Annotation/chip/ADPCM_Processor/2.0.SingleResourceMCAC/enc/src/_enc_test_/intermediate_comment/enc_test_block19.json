    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating the clock signal for the UART module. This is accomplished by utilizing an always block in Verilog, which toggles the `uart_clk` signal every half of the `UART_CLK_PERIOD`, creating a signal that oscillates at the frequency defined by `UART_CLK_PERIOD`."
