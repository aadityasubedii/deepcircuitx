This code block is for assigning the test_status_set signal. The signal gets its value from a module, specifically `U_TEST_MODULE`. The `assign` keyword in Verilog means that the operation is happening continuously. So, the value of `test_status_set` is thus always synced with `U_TEST_MODULE.test_status_set`.
