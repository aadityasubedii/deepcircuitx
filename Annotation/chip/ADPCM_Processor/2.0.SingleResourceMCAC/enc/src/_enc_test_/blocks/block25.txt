This block of code is responsible for bitwise copying, specifically, it clones the lower 32-bits of a 64-bit variable to its higher 32-bits. The implementation utilizes the 'assign' keyword in Verilog to carry out the 'bitwise copy' operation, enabling the lower 32 bits (from 0 to 31) of 'o_wb_dat_e' to be directly copied to its upper bits (from 32 to 63).
