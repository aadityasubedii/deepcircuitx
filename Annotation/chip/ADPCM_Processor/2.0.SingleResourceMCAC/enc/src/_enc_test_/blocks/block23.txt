Comment: 
This line of Verilog code assigns the bit values of the bit range 31:0 of the wire `o_wb_dat_d` to its higher order bit range 95:64. It works by directly mapping the values of the lower 32-bits to the 32-bits of the higher order. Effectively, this code duplicates the lower 32-bits to a higher order 32-bit segment of the same wire.
