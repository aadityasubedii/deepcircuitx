Comment: 
This line of code functions to copy the lower 32 bits of the o_wb_dat_d bus into its upper 32 bits. This copying is implemented using the 'assign' system task which forces continuous assignment, thereby ensuring that whenever there's a change in the value of the lower 32-bits (o_wb_dat_d[31:0]), the new value gets immediately reflected in the upper 32-bits (o_wb_dat_d[63:32]), making it suitable for data manipulation or various optimizations in a 64-bit wide system.
