Comment: 
This block of Verilog code functions as a data lane re-routing module. It essentially transfers data between two sections of a wider data bus. The implementation consists of a single line assignment that re-assigns the data present on the lower 32 bits (31:0) of the 'o_wb_dat_e' bus to the upper 32 bits (95:64) on the same 'o_wb_dat_e' bus, essentially replumbing the information through different lanes of the bus.
