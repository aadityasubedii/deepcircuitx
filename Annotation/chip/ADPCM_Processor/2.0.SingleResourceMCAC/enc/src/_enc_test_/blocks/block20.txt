Comment: 
This line of Verilog code defines a clock signal generator. Using the `always` keyword, this block forms an infinite loop which toggles the clock signal (`clk = ~clk`) every half period of the defined `CLK_PERIOD`, effectively generating a continuous clock signal with a period of `CLK_PERIOD`. This is a core part of any synchronous digital system, ensuring that all operations are synced to a specific, recurring timing signal.
