Module name: test. Module specification: This module is a testbench for an encoder/decoder system, designed to verify its functionality under various configurations and input conditions. It doesn't have explicit input or output ports, as it's a self-contained testbench. Instead, it generates stimuli and monitors internal signals. Key internal signals include clocks (clk, uart_clk), reset, encoder inputs (enc_s, enc_s_clk, enc_s_fs), encoder outputs (enc_o, enc_o_clk, enc_o_fs), and various Wishbone bus signals for memory and peripheral communication. The module is structured into several sections: initialization and configuration, clock generation, memory loading, test vector generation and application, output capture and verification, and error checking. It includes functionality for loading boot and main memory, configuring the system under test, generating input signals based on predefined test vectors, capturing and verifying
