    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code reassigns the lower 32 bits of the output vector `o_wb_dat_e` to its higher bits. Specifically, the initial 32 bits of `o_wb_dat_e` (from 0 to 31) are mirrored onto the bits 32 to 63, 64 to 95, and 96 to 127 of the same output vector. This effectively replicates the content of the lower 32 bits across the entire 128-bit vector in four equal segments."
