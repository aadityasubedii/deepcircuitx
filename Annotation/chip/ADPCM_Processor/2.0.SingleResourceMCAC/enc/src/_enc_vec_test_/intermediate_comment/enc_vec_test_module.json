    "module": "Module-level comment: This testbench simulates and validates an encoder/decoder system. It generates clock signals, resets, and test vectors, then applies them to the design under test. The module reads test cases and vectors from files, configures the system, captures outputs, and compares them against expected results. It implements error checking, register display, and timeout handling. The testbench supports various rates, laws, and operations, allowing comprehensive testing of the encoder/decoder functionality."
