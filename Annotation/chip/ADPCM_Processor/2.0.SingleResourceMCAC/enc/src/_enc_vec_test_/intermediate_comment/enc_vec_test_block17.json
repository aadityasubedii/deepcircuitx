    "block_comment": "This block of code increments a clock cycle count every positive edge of the system clock. The `always @` statement in Verilog is event-driven, executing whenever there is a positive edge (`posedge`) on the system clock (`U_SYSTEM.clk`). The counter `clk_count` is then incremented by 1 (`clk_count + 1'd1`) on each clock tick."
