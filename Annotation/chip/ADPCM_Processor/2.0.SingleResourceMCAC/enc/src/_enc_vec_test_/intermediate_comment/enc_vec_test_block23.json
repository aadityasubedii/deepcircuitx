    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a clock signal for the UART module. It uses a Verilog `always` construct to indefinitely and periodically invert the value of the `uart_clk` signal. The period of this clock signal is defined by `UART_CLK_PERIOD` macro, and each pulse of the clock lasts half of this period, resulting in a clock signal with 50% duty cycle."
