    "block_comment": "This block of code constitutes a test status checker in a testbench environment. It determines the status of the test - whether it has passed, failed, or encountered an error - and subsequently performs specific actions based on the outcome. The results are both displayed in the console and written into a log file. Test statuses are checked using the \"testfail\" and \"test_status_reg\" signals. If \"test_status_set\" is true or a test failure occurs, the block verifies the value of \"test_status_reg\". If its value equals 17 and no test failure has occurred, the test is announced as passed. Otherwise, it checks if a \"testfail\" has occurred, and in such cases, the test is announced as failed. When the register value is greater than or equal to 'h8000 or if none of the preceding conditions satisfy, an error message is reported stating the line number or error code depending on the value of \"test_status_reg\"."
