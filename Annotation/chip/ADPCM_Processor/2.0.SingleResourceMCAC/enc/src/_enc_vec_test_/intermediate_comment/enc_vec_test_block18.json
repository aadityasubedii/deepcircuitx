    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents an asynchronous reset and synchronization mechanism. When a 'reset' signal is detected, the 'program_start' signal is set to zero, effectively triggering initialization. In the absence of a 'reset' signal, the block waits for the 'config_done' signal to go high and 'program_start' to be low before setting a specific address and toggling the 'rs' signal. From this address, it reads data, and if the data is '1', it sets 'program_start' to '1' signifying that the program has started. This represents the primary control flow for the beginning of a program, managed synchronously with a clock signal."
