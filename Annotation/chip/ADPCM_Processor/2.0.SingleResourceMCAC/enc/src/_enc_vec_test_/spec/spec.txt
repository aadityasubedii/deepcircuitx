Module name: test. Module specification: This module is a testbench for simulating and validating the functionality of an encoder/decoder system. It sets up clock signals, resets, and initializes memory with test vectors. The testbench has no external input or output ports, as it generates stimuli and monitors internal signals of the design under test. Key internal signals include clocks (clk, uart_clk), reset, encoder inputs (enc_s, enc_s_clk, enc_s_fs), scan chain signals, and various counters and flags for test control. The module is organized into several sections: initialization, clock generation, memory loading, test vector generation, output capture, and error checking. It simulates various test cases with different rates, laws, and operations, reading test vectors from files and comparing outputs against expected results. The testbench also includes functions for error checking, displaying register contents, and handling timeouts. Additionally
