Comment: 
This block monitors clock and reset signals, and controls a serial counter and an encoder sample clock. When a reset event occurs, it sets `enc_s_clk` to 0 and resets `ser_count` to 0. If no reset occurs, with each positive edge of the clock, `ser_count` increments unless its value reaches 59 (0x3B), in which case, `ser_count` is reset and `enc_s_clk` toggles between 0 and 1.
