This block of Verilog code is used for including a local parameter file in the system. It follows the form '`include FILE', where FILE is a relative path pointing towards the file a25_localparams.vh, located in the folder named "include". By including this file, local parameters or macros stored in "a25_localparams.vh" are made accessible to the Verilog module, easing the reuse of constants and parameters across multiple modules or systems. Thus helping in attaining a neat, modular and scalable code organization.
