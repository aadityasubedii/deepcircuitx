This line of code in Verilog imports and includes the 'a25_functions.vh' file from the 'include' folder in the parent directory. Whenever this file is compiled, all the functions, definitions, and modules available inside the 'a25_functions.vh' file would also be compiled and made available in the code below this line. This allows for code reusability and modularity, making it easier to manage and debug design.
