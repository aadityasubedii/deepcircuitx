Comment: 
This block of code declares two register variables and one integer variable. The `tdmo_fs_prev` and `captured_data` are registers that will be used to store temporary data within the system, and most likely involved in some data processing or decision-making logic within the design. The integer `tdmo_delay_start` is used to store the delay start value for some time division multiplexing output (TDMO) indicating that this delay is programmable or calculated within the hardware design.
