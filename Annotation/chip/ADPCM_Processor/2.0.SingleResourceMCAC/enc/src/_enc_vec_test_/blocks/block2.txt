Comment: 
The function of the given Verilog block is to display the status of an Amber Core's registers and status bits. The block first displays a separator line for organization and then displays the status of each register and bit. It does this by using `$display` statements to print each register's status `r0` through `r15`, as well as status bits for the modes `FIRQ`, `IRQ`, and `SVC`. An `endcase` directive is used to differentiate between these modes. Finally, the block prints the status bits for `N`, `Z`, `C`, `V`, etc., marking the end of the register display with another separator line.
