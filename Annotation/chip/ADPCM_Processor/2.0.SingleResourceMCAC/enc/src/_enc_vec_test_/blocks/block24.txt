Comment: 
This line of code generates a clock signal in a testbench environment for a Verilog digital design. The clock signal, designated as 'clk', toggles at every half period of the defined clock cycle, `CLK_PERIOD/2`, thereby creating a square wave of frequency equivalent to the inverse of the defined `CLK_PERIOD`. By using the `always` keyword with the specified delay, the code block ensures that the operation is executed recurrently, and the clock signal 'clk' changes its state from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0, generating the desired clock signal.
