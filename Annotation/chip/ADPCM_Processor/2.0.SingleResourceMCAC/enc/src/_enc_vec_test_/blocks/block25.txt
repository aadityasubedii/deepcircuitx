The `config_mod` block serves as a configurable module for scanning, testing, and data transfer purposes in the system. It employs multiple scan inputs and outputs for performing scan operations, controlled by `scan_enable` signal. The test mode is determined by the `test_mode` signal. The module uses read and write strob signals (`rs` and `ws`) along with chip select (`cs`) for accessing data (`w_data` and `r_data`). Address access is controlled by `addrs`. Moreover, it interfaces with the Wishbone bus, with separate input (`i_wb*`) and output (`o_wb*`) signals for address, select lines, write enable, data, and control (`cyc` and `stb`) for enhanced and dedicated buses. It provides a mechanism for the acknowledgment of operations and error handling via `o_wb_ack*` and `o_wb_err*` signals.
