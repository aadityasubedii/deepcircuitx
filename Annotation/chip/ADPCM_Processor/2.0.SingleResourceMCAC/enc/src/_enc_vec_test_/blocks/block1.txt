The function `insert_32_into_128` inserts a 32-bit word into a 128-bit word at a specified position. It takes as input a 2-bit position index, a 128-bit word, and a 32-bit word. Depending on the value of the position index, the function places the 32-bit word at the appropriate position in the 128-bit word. If the position index is '00', '01', '10', or '11', the 32-bit word is placed at the beginning, after the first 32 bits, after the second 32 bits, or after the third 32 bits of the 128-bit word, respectively. The original content of the 128-bit word in the target position and subsequent bits are replaced with the 32-bit word, while the remaining part of the 128-bit word stays the same.
