Comment: 
This block of code initiates the instantiation of a `dumpvcd` system task module. The purpose of the task is to start a Value Change Dump (VCD) for simulation waveforms during testbench simulations. By instantiating `dumpvcd`, it enables the tracking of all internal and external signal transitions and logs them into a .vcd file which can later be visualized using waveform viewers. This could be instrumental in debugging and verifying the correctness of the design under test.
