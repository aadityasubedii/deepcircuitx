This block of code mainly functions as a system reset for memory load from a specified file. Upon the positive edge of the system reset, it waits for a number of clock ticks defined by `RESET_MEM_TICKS`. The system then attempts to open and read from a memory file, `MAIN_MEM_FILE`. If the file cannot be opened, an error message is displayed. For a successful file open, the code reads each line, aligns the input, and checks certain conditions. If conditions are met, the read data is converted from hexadecimal characters to 32-bit values and then loaded into the memory location specified by the file address. There is also an optional debug display that shows what values are being loaded into which memory address. The process goes on until all lines in the file have been read and processed.
