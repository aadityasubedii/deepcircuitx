Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code performs the function of loading the bootloader memory from the `BOOT_MEM_FILE`. It's implemented with a synchronous process that's triggered on the rising edge of the system reset. If successfully opened, it reads line-by-line from the file and formats the input data for correct memory alignment and inclusion. It specifically checks for correct line formatting and data alignment before inserting the data into the memory. If any errors occur during file opening or data reading and alignment, the block generates error messages on the display and can finish the operation prematurely. Additionally, some debug information is displayed, and a timeout value is set. The block also opens a log file used for subsequent logging operations.
