The given block of code is responsible for duplicating a 32-bit data word across a 128-bit wide data bus. This is achieved by repetitively assigning the lowest 32 bits (bits from 0 to 31) of o_wb_dat_d to the higher sections of the 128-bit bus (bits from 32 to 127), thereby creating four repeated 32-bit data words across the entire 128-bit bus.
