Module-level comment: Module 'tb_uart' serves as a test bench for a UART, offering configuration for the transmitter and loopback functionalities. Its operations are triggered by input signals like clk, reset, scan_enable, test_mode, i_uart_cts_n, and i_uart_rxd. The outputs include o_uart_txd (transmit data line) and o_uart_rts_n (flow control output). The process of receiving and transmitting data is managed through internal signals, such as rx_state, rx_bit, rx_bit_start, and their transmit counterparts, with data storage controlled via FIFO operation. The module uses three major always blocks for handling reception and transmission processes.
