Comment: 
This block handles the bit count for a UART receiver pipeline. Upon a reset signal, it resets the `rx_bit_count` back to zero. The same operation applies when the received bit count reaches nine, indicating that one data byte along with a start and stop bit has been processed. Furthermore, whenever a falling edge (negative edge) is detected on the `rx_start` signal, it triggers a reset for the `rx_bit_count`, preparing for a new incoming data byte. Otherwise, the bit count is incremented by one upon each clock cycle for the UART receiver clock.
