    "block_comment": "The block assigns the rx_bit_start flag when the rx_bit_count equals zero. This is implemented using the bit-wise equality operator, comparing the rx_bit_count with a 4-bit hexadecimal zero. The purpose of this block is to initiate the transmission sequence whenever rx_bit_count resets to zero."
