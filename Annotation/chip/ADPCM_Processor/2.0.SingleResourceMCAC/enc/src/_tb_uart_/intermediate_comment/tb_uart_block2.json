    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to identify the negative edge of a start bit in a received serial data stream (Function of the block). It uses a bitwise AND operation between a delayed signal (rx_tap[1]), an inverted signal (not rx_tap[0]) and a state checking condition (rx_state == 2'h0) to recognize the falling edge, which signals the beginning of the start bit. The result of this operation is assigned to the signal rx_start_negedge (Implementation details of the block)."
