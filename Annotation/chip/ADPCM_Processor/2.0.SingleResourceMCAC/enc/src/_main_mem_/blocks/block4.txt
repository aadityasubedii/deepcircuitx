Comment: 
This block of code performs selective bit masking operation on write data. Based on the values set in the write mask array (wr_mask), it either retains the read data (rd_data) or replaces it with the write data (wr_data). This selection is performed repeatedly for 16 instances, each instance handling 8 bits of data, which essentially results in bytes getting masked. If the mask bit is set, the corresponding byte from rd_data is retained; else the byte from wr_data is written.
