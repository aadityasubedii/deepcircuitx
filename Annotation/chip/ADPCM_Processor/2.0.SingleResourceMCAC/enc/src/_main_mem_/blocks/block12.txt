The given block of code is an if-conditional generate statement used to conditionally instantiate hardware depending upon the parameter "WB_DWIDTH". If it equals 128, it enables the instantiation of a 128-bit wide register "wb_rdata128". The generate-if statement provides a useful mechanism for parameterizing the hardware based on compile-time constants, optimizing the design for different configurations. It allows for the hardware to be more flexible and reusable in different contexts and configurations.
