    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'main_mem' is a dynamic memory management module in a Wishbone bus system that performs read/write operations and dynamically adjusts between 128-bit and 32-bit widths based on WB_DWIDTH. It utilizes a set of control signals (clk, reset, scan_enable, test_mode, i_mem_ctrl, i_wb_adr, i_wb_sel, i_wb_we, i_wb_dat, i_wb_cyc, i_wb_stb) for input and outputs data and status (o_wb_dat, o_wb_ack, o_wb_err). Internal signals manage operation start-points, memory data, write control, addressing and load selection based on memory width. Based on memory width, it follows specific block ('wb128' or 'wb32') instructions to achieve memory operations."
