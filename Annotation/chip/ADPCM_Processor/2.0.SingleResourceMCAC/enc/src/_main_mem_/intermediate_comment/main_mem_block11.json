    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the operations of a synchronous RAM module in Verilog RTL code. When a reset signal is received, it wipes all data by setting the write enable (`wr_en`), write mask(`wr_mask`), write data(`wr_data`), and address variable(`addr_d1`) to 0. Importantly, it also clears all RAM contents using a loop. When no reset signal is present but there is a clock signal, it updates the `wr_en`, `wr_mask`, and `wr_data` with incoming data, and sets the `addr_d1` based on the `i_mem_ctrl` signal. If write enable(`wr_en`), it writes `masked_wdata` into the RAM at the address specified by `addr_d1`."
