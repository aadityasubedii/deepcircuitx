    "block_comment": "The block handles memory write operations in the system. At the positive edge of reset or clock, if reset is asserted, the block clears the write enable, write mask, write data, previous address, and contents of the RAM array. If reset is not asserted, it sets the write enable from the 'start_write' input, generates write masks based on 'i_wb_adr' value and masks data from 'i_wb_dat'. It sets the address based on the 'i_mem_ctrl' and 'i_wb_adr' values. Subsequently, if 'wr_en' is ON, the block writes data to the RAM at the specified address and, with AMBER_MEMIF_DEBUG flag, logs the write operation details."
