    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous block responsible for sequential data read operations. On each positive edge of the `reset` or `clk`, it checks the `reset` signal. If `reset` is high, it initializes `start_read_d1`, `start_read_d2`, and `wb_rdata32` to 0. If `reset` is low, it proceeds to pass `start_read` to `start_read_d1`, and `start_read_d1` to `start_read_d2`. If `start_read_d1` is high indicating a read operation, it does a selection operation on `rd_data` based on the least two significant bits of `addr_d1` to select corresponding range of data and assign it to `wb_rdata32`."
