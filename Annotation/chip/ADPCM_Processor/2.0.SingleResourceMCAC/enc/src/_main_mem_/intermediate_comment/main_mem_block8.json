    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code facilitates a synchronous reset and data read operation for a specific digital system. It responds to the positive edges of a 'reset' or 'clock' (clk) signal. Upon encountering a reset signal, the block resets the values of 'start_read_d1', 'start_read_d2', and 'wb_rdata128'. For every clock cycle without a reset signal, the code shifts 'start_read' into 'start_read_d1' and 'start_read_d1' into 'start_read_d2', effectively creating a two-stage pipeline for start_read signal. Furthermore, when 'start_read_d1' is true, it initiates a read operation and the read data (rd_data) is assigned to the 'wb_rdata128'."
