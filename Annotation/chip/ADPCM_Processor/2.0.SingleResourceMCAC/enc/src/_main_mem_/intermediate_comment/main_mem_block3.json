    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL represents a data read operation from a RAM. It uses an assigned statement to map the output data to the address of the RAM. Specifically, the block retrieves the data stored at the location specified by the bits 2 to 27 from the variable 'addr_d1', and assigns this data to the variable 'rd_data'."
