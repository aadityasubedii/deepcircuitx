It handles reading from and writing to memory, based accordingly on the control signals provided. The memory width dynamically adjusts between 128-bit and 32-bit, depending on the Wishbone data width (WB_DWIDTH). The module is written in RTL (Register Transfer Level) and is intended for memory operations including read, write, and addressing, and has error handling logic embedded."

It is used to put the system in its initial state.\n\n3. scan_enable: Input signal that is used during testing modes to control the scanning of the memory module.\n   \n4. test_mode: Input signal to enable / disable test mode of operation.\n\n5. i_mem_ctrl: Input memory control signal. Controls certain memory operations such as addressing.\n\n6. i_wb_adr: Input address used with the wishbone interface.\n\n7. i_wb_sel: Input signal that is used for selecting the desired data word in memory for read/write operations.\n\n8. i_wb_we: Input Write Enable signal for the Wishbone bus.

If high, indicates a bus error has occurred during read/write operation.\n\nExplanation: The input ports are all related to the control and execution of read and write operations to the memory module, with some specific to standard system functions (clock, reset) and others to the Wishbone memory bus protocol (wb_adr, wb_dat, etc.). The output ports are all for communication with the Wishbone interface, conveying the data being read, if the bus is ready for a new transfer, and if any errors occurred in the last operation.\n"
