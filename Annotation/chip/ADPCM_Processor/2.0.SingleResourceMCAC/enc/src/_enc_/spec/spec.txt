Module name: enc. Module specification: The 'enc' module is a top-level encryption module that integrates various functional components. It operates with a system clock and reset, and includes interfaces for encoder input/output, UART communication, and Wishbone bus connections. The module incorporates several sub-modules: CLK_GEN for clock generation, wishbone_arbiter for bus management, boot_mem128 for boot memory, APRSC for coprocessor operations, uart for serial communication, TDMI and TDMO for time-division multiplexing input/output, test_module for testing functions, timer_module for timing operations, interrupt_controller for managing interrupts, and a25_core (Amber core) as the main processor. These components are interconnected via internal wires and buses, including Wishbone interfaces for slaves and masters. The module handles various control signals, data transfers, and interrupt management. It processes
