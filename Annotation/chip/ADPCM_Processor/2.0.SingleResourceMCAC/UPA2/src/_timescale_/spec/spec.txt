The provided Verilog code doesn't represent a module. It only includes the `timescale directive. The `timescale directive is a compiler directive in Verilog that is used to define the unit of time and its precision used in the simulation of that Verilog code. 

Given this, the structured information would look like this:

Module name: Not applicable.
Module specification: The existing Verilog code snippet doesn't define a module, but only uses the `timescale directive. The `timescale directive sets the unit of time to 1 nanosecond with a time precision of 1 nanosecond, thus defining the simulation time scale. Without a module, there's no information to provide functionality, input/output ports details, internal signals, or blocks and their functions. 

Please provide a more complete Verilog RTL code for a detailed specification.
