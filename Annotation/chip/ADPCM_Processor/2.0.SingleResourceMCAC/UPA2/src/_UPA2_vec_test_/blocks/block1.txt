This block of Verilog code serves as a termination statement. The function is indicated by the "$finish;" instruction, which typically ends a simulation test bench when the circumstances defined in the test bench are satisfied. The implementation relies on a delay introduced by "#10" to pause the simulation for 10 units of time before executing the following commands. After the delay, "$display" instruction outputs a string message "%t TEST COMPLETE", where "%t" is replaced by the current simulation time, indicated by "$time". This provides an indication that the certain part of the test bench or the entire simulation has completed.
