This block of code generates a clock signal with a period defined by the 'CLK_PERIOD' macro. The simulation environment initializes the clock variable, and then every 'CLK_PERIOD/2' units of time, it toggles the value (switches between 0 and 1) using the bitwise negation operator (~). This creates a waveform that mirrors the behavior of a digital clock in a physical device, thereby providing a time reference to the rest of the digital design.
