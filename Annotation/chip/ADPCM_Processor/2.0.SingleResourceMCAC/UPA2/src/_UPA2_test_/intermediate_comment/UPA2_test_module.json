    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThis testbench 'test' is dedicated to stimulating varying conditions for validating the 'UPA2' module. Key roles include control signals (`clk`, `reset`), test inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), scan activator (`scan_enable`), and 'UPA2' test mode enabler (`test_mode`). 'UPA2' feedbacks test scan results via `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` signals. The `initial` block configures testing context, performs optional SDF scan annotation, initializes control signals and concludes simulation. An UPA2 instance is created linking the internal signals established prior. The testbench aids scrutinizing the UPA2's response to diverse scenarios."
