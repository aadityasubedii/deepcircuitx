    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the initialization sequence for the system. It sets the time format, clock, reset, and involves scan modes under certain conditions. The block primarily sets the system clock (clk) to a low state, system reset (reset) to a low state, disables all scan inputs (scan_inX), scan mode (scan_enable), and testing mode (test_mode). If the macro `SDFSCAN` is defined, it also annotates a standardized delay format (SDF) file for back-annotated timing simulation. At the end, it calls `$finish` to end the simulation."
