    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to implement conditional operations based on the variables A1 and A1S. This block behaves differently depending on the status of A1S: when A1S isn't asserted, the block interprets A1 as a 14-bit number and scales it down if it exceeds 8191 or sets it to 32764 otherwise. Conversely, when A1S is asserted, the block scales A1 down if it exceeds 57345, or sets it to 98308 otherwise. The decision-making process is implemented using ternary operations."
