    "block_comment": "The given block of code forms a unary logic array (ULA2) that performs both a 2's complement operation and basic numeric operation, conditionally based on the status of the A2S signal. It calculates 2's complement of A2[15:7] if A2S is valid (true), and subtracts A2[15:7] from 65536 otherwise. Seven 0 bits ('b0000000) are prepended to A2[15:7] before it is subtracted from 65536 to maintain the bit length balance in the operations. When calculating the 2's complement, the code also includes an addition operation of 65024 for proper 2's complement conversion."
