    "block_comment": "This block of code performs arithmetic operations using the `assign` keyword. It first adds the values of UGA2 and ULA2, assigning the result to UA2. Furthermore, the second operation adds A2 to UA2 and assigns the result to A2T. These operations are likely implementations of some high-level protocol or system behavior."
