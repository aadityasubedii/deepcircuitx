    "spec": "Module name: UPA2. \n\nModule specification: The UPA2 is a complex computational module that performs arithmetic operations and bitwise functions on its input signals. It uses these to ultimately generate a 16-bit output signal, A2T. \n\nThe module has several input ports: a reset signal, a clock signal, a test mode signal, five scan-related signals used for testing, three control signals PK0, PK1, and PK2, two 16-bit input buses A1 and A2, and a signal PK flag. These inputs dictate the behavior of the module and provide data for processing.\n\nThe module's output ports include five scan-test outputs and the 16-bit data bus A2T, which reflects the final computed result.\n\nInternal signals include PKS1 and PKS2, which hold the result of XOR operations; UGA2A, which stores a value selected based on PKS2; A1S which stores the most significant bit of A1; FA1 and FA that store transformed versions of the inputs A1 and A2; UGA2B, which is the sum of UGA2A and FA; UGA2S, which stores the most significant bit of UGA2B; the 16-bit wire 'a', which holds a transformed version of UGA2B; UGA2, which stores either zero or 'a' based on the signal PK flag; A2S, which stores the most significant bit of A2; ULA2, which stores a transformed version of A2 based on A2S; and UA2, which is the result of the addition operation between UGA2 and ULA2.\n\nThe blocks of code in the module include logic to process the input data (including XOR operations, selective statements, addition operations), transformations based on signal values, and assignment operations to generate the final output, A2T. These operations suggest complex data or signal manipulation, possibly associated with functions such as encryption or error correction, often found in communication or memory devices.",
