    "module": "Module-level comment: The UPA2 module performs complex arithmetic and bitwise operations on input signals to compute a 16-bit output, A2T. It uses several input signals, control flags, test signals, and internal registers and wires for processing. The module achieves this through a series of controlled transformations, XOR operations, selective statements based on most significant bits, and additions on transformed inputs. Anticipated use cases might include data manipulation in communication or memory devices."
