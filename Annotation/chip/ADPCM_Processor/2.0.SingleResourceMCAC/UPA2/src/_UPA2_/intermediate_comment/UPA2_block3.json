    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily handles assignment operations related to the calculation of 'UGA2B' and 'FA' values, with conditions based on 'PKS1' and 'SIGPK'. The 'FA' value is determined based on the condition whether 'PKS1' is true or not, choosing between 'FA1' or '131072-FA1'. Then, using 'UGA2A' and 'FA', 'UGA2B' is calculated. Following this, the 17th bit of 'UGA2B' is assigned to 'UGA2S' while 'a' is calculated based on 'UGA2S' with different options for assigning, respectively. Finally, based on the 'SIGPK' signal status, 'UGA2' is assigned with either 0 or 'a'. The 16th bit of 'A2' is assigned to 'A2S'."
