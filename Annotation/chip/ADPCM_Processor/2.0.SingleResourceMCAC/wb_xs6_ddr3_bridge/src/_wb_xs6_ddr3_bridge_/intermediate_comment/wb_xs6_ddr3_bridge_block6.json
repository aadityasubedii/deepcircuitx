    "block_comment": "This block of code manages memory read and write requests in response to a trigger at positive clock edge. It operates by checking several conditional flags. If 'read_ack_r' flag is set, 'read_ready' is enabled, and if a 'read_request' is received while it's not ready, 'read_ready' is disabled. In case the command interface is not full, it captures write and read requests while determining the write-back address depending on the memory control signal. The block monitors 'read_request' to activate 'read_active_r'. 'read_ack_r' signal is enabled or disabled based on 'i_rd_empty' flag and 'read_active_r' status."
