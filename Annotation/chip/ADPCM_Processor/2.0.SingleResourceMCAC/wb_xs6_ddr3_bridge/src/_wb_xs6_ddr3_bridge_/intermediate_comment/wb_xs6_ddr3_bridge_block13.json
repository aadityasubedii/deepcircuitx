    "block_comment": "This block enables a command if it is not full and already enabled. The functionality is achieved using a boolean AND operation between 'cmd_en_r' (a register holding the command enable status) and the negation of 'i_cmd_full' (an indication of whether the command is full or not). If 'i_cmd_full' is false (indicating the command is not full) and 'cmd_en_r' is true (indicating the command is already enabled), 'o_cmd_en' is assigned as true."
