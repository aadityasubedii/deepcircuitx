    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block manages a data write operation to a buffer under certain conditions. Specifically, it runs synchronously with a positive edge of a clock signal (i_clk). On detection of a high state in both 'write_request' and 'i_cmd_full' signals, the block initiates a data write operation, setting 'write_buf_r' to 1, and transferring 'i_wb_sel', 'i_wb_dat', and 'i_wb_adr' inputs to their respective internal buffer registers."
