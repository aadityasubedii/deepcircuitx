    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for handling the handshaking of command signals in a synchronous design. The signal 'cmd_full_r' gets updated on the rising edge of 'i_clk' with the current state of 'i_cmd_full', thereby enforcing synchronization of 'cmd_full_r' with the system clock. The one-cycle delay introduced ensures clean, glitch-free transitions between command states."
