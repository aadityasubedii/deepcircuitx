    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating values on the positive edge of the clock, assuming the command is not full. It specifically drives address and enable signal for command execution and determines the type of command instruction. The block makes these updates synchronously to the clock signal as long as `i_cmd_full` is not set. The byte address is generated by concatenating the relevant bits of `wb_adr_r` with 4'b0. The `cmd_en_r` is set if there is a write request or read request, and `o_cmd_instr` is set based on the type of request: '0' for write request and '1' for read request."
