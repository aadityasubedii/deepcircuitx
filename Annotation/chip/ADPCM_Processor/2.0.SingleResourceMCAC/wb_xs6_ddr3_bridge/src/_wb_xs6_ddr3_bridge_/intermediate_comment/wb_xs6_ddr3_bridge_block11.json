    "block_comment": "The code block is for assigning values to wire signals 'wb_sel', 'wb_dat', and 'wb_adr' based on the condition of 'write_buf_r'. If 'write_buf_r' is true, signals are assigned the values from their respective buffer registers (wb_sel_buf_r, wb_dat_buf_r, wb_adr_buf_r). If 'write_buf_r' is false, the input signals (i_wb_sel, i_wb_dat, i_wb_adr) are directly assigned to the corresponding wires. The ternary operator (?:) in Verilog is used for the conditional assignment."
