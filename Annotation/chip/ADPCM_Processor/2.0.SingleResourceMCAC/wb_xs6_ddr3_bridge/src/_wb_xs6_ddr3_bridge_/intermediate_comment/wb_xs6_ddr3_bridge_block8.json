    "block_comment": "This block implements a conditional data write operation on a rising edge of a clock signal. It checks whether the command buffer is not full (i_cmd_full is 0), and if so, updates several output and register values related to write processes. Specifically, the 'wr_en_r' register is given the value of the 'write_request'. The 'o_wr_mask' is assigned the negated value of 'wb_sel', and 'o_wr_data' is assigned the value of 'wb_dat'. This way, the block supports write enablement, data transfer and write masking when the command buffer is not full."
