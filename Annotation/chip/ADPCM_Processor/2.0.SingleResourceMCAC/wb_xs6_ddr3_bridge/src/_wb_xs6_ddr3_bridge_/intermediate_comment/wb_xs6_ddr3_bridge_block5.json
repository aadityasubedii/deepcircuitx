    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional hardware generation block in Verilog based on the width of the WriteBack (WB) data. If the `WB_DWIDTH` is set to 32, which indicates a 32-bit data width, then the code inside `wb32r` will be synthesised. This design is mainly used for creating hardware that is configurable, based on certain parameters like data width. Using this structure helps in reusing the same hardware design for different configurations, thereby making the design more scalable."
