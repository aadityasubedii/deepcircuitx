    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for enabling write operations when certain conditions are met. More specifically, it uses the `assign` keyword to constantly assign the logical conjunction of `wr_en_r` and the negation of `i_cmd_full` to `o_wr_en`. If `wr_en_r` is high and `i_cmd_full` is low (indicating that the command queue is not full), `o_wr_en` is set high to allow write operations. Given the active high characteristics, the code ensures that write operations only happen when enabled and there is room in the command queue."
