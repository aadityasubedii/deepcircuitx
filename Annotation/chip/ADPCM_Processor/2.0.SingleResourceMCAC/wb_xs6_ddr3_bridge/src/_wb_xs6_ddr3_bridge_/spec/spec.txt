Module name: wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge. 

Module specification: The 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' module serves as a bidirectional interface between a Wishbone bus (WB) and an XS6 DDR3 memory controller. It is parameterized according to the data width (WB_DWIDTH) and the select lines width (WB_SWIDTH) for the Wishbone bus. 

The module has input ports such as 'i_clk' for the system clock, 'i_mem_ctrl' for determining the memory addressing, 'i_wb_adr', 'i_wb_sel' and 'i_wb_dat' for the address, selection, and data from the Wishbone bus, 'i_wb_we' as a write-enable signal, 'i_wb_cyc' and 'i_wb_stb' for managing communication cycle, 'i_cmd_full' to indicate if the command buffer is full, 'i_wr_full' to indicate if the write buffer is full, 'i_rd_data' to receive read data from memory controller and 'i_rd_empty' to check if the read buffer is empty or not. 

Output ports such as 'o_wb_dat' returns data to the Wishbone bus, 'o_wb_ack' an acknowledge signal, 'o_wb_err' to indicate any error, 'o_cmd_en' an enable signal for memory command, 'o_cmd_instr' & 'o_cmd_byte_addr' to command the instruction that will be sent to the memory controller, 'o_wr_en' is the write enable signal, 'o_wr_mask' determines which byte lanes to enable during a memory write operation and 'o_wr_data' to send the write data to the DDR3 memory.

There are several internal signals namely 'write_request', 'read_request', 'write_request_r', 'read_request_r', 'read_active_r', 'wb_adr_r', 'cmd_full_r', 'read_ack_r', 'read_ready', 'cmd_en_r', 'wr_en_r', 'write_ack', 'write_buf_r', 'wb_sel_buf_r', 'wb_dat_buf_r', 'wb_adr_buf_r', 'wb_sel', 'wb_dat', 'wb_adr' which handle tasks such as managing the read and write operations, the generation of acknowledge signals during read and write operations, buffering and assignment during active read and write requests, and updating of read and write requests, among others. 

The blocks of code within the module mainly contain assignment, generate and always blocks for managing read/write operations, acknowledging signals handling, and interactive memory operations. Complexities such as buffering during full conditions, and data width handling are efficiently covered within the module. The module can handle both single and burst transactions and the memory addressing has been manipulated as per requirements of DDR memory with elastic data width assignments. This 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' module provides an effective bridge for communicating between a system and memory while handling all possible scenarios to facilitate the smooth transition of the data.
