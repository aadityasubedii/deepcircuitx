Module-level comment: The 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' module interfaces between a Wishbone bus and an XS6 DDR3 memory controller. It accommodates both single and burst transactions, with custom handling for memory addressing and variable data widths. It operates through the use of input and output ports and internal control signals. The key functions include handling read/write requests, buffering when command buffer is full, and acknowledgement signal generation. Always and Generate blocks manage these operations, ensuring robust and efficient communication between the system and memory.
