Comment: 
This block of code is a conditional generation block in Verilog which is used to generate specific hardware configurations based on compile-time parameters. In this case, it checks if the parameter WB_DWIDTH is equal to 32, and if the conditions are met, implements a hardware structure or logic labelled as "wb32w". The specific hardware configuration that should be activated for this condition is not shown in the provided code block. It is implied that, in the complete system, a 32-bit wide writeback databus is in place, controlled by the parameter WB_DWIDTH.
