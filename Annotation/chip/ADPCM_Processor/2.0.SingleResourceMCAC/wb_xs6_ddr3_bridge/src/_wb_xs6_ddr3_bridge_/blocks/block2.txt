Comment: 
This block of Verilog code performs the function of generating a write acknowledgement signal (`write_ack`). This happens under the condition that there is a write request (`write_request`) and the write buffer is currently not read (`!write_buf_r`). In effect, this logic ensures that the system acknowledges write requests only when the write buffer isn't being read, thereby preventing any potential data collision.
