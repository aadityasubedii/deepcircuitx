Comment: 
This block of Verilog code executes a write operation in synchronous timing with rising edge of a clock signal. It conditions the activation of write operations on the signal 'i_cmd_full' not being high. If the write buffer is not full, the 'wr_en_r' signal is set to trigger a write request or writing to the buffer, and 'o_wr_mask' uses a logical operation to divide the device's available memory into blocks based on address indexing, then writes to the chosen block. Additionally, the 'o_wr_data' is populated with the data to be written, which is repeated 4 times.
