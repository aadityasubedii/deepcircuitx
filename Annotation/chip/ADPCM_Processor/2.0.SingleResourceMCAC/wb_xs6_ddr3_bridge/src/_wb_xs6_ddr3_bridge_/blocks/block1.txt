Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for generating the WB (Wishbone) Bus acknowledgment signal (`o_wb_ack`). This signal indicates a successful bus cycle either for a read or write operation. The WB acknowledgment for the read operation goes high when a Wishbone STROBE signal (`i_wb_stb`) is received and the read acknowledge signal (`read_ack_r`) is asserted. Similarly, for write operations, it simply follows the assertion of a write acknowledge signal (`write_ack`).
