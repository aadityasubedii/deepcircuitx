This block of Verilog code performs the function of a data latch. Specifically, it latches the read data (i_rd_data) onto the write back data (o_wb_dat) whenever a rising edge of the clock (i_clk) is detected. It only does this under two conditions: one, when the read fifo is not empty (!i_rd_empty) and two, when an active read command (read_active_r) is signaled. These condition checks ensure that valid data is latched and prevent data corruption if there's no new data in the read fifo.
