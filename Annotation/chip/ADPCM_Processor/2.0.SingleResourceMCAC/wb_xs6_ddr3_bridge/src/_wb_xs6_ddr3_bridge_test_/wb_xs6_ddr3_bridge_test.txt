Module-level comment: This is the 'test' module, primarily used for testing through the instantiation of 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge'. It initiates clock 'clk', reset signal 'reset', scan input signals 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', scan enable 'scan_enable', and test mode 'test_mode' signals with 0 at start. These inputs result in 'scan_out' signals for assessment after passing through the 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge'. It also includes optional SDF annotation for simulation timing checks.
