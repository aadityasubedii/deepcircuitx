    "block_comment": "This code block is designed for initial setup and testing with specific conditions in Verilog RTL. This block starts by setting the time format for simulation, then under \"SDFSCAN\" compile condition, stimulates a delay and fault injection through `$sdf_annotate` function. Subsequently, it declares and initializes several single-bit variables such as 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in' series, 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' all to a low state (0). After completing these tasks, it uses the `$finish` system task to terminate the simulation."
