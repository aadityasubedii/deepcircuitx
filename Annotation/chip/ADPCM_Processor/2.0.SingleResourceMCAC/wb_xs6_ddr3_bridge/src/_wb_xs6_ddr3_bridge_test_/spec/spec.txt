Module name: test. 

Module specification: The "test" module is a top-level module used primarily for testing purposes. Its functionality involves the instantiation of the 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' sub-module and initialization of various signals to set-up the simulation environment. It regulates synchronous operations via the 'clk' input and can reset the state of the system via the 'reset' input. For testing, it uses 'scan_in' signals (scan_in0 - scan_in4) along with 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' signals. The corresponding 'scan_out' signals (scan_out0 - scan_out4) constitute its output and used to observe the impact of the inputs to the scan chain. 

This module essentially contains three sections. The first section declares the inputs and output signals. The second contains the instantiation of the 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge', passing the input signals to it and capturing the output signals after instantiation. The final section is an 'initial' block that sets the time format, potentially annotates Standard Delay Format (SDF) file for delay or timing checks if the SDFSCAN is defined, and initializes the input signals to 0.
