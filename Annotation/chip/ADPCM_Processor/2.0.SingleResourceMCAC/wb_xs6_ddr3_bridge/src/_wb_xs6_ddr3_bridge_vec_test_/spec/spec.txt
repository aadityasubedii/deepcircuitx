Module name: test. 

Module specification: The 'test' module functions as a supervisor for interfacing with the 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' module, primarily focusing on scan-based testing operations. It provides and controls various scan input signals like 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' and also manages a 'scan_enable' signal to enable or disable scanning. Other significant signals like 'test_mode' and 'reset' are used to control the overall system or module operation. The 'test_mode' signal toggles between normal operation and test mode, while the 'reset' signal helps initialize the state to a known condition before starting operations. Moreover, the 'test' module handles the output from the 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' module via 'scan_out' signals ranging from 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4'. These output signals are crucial for understanding the output states of the circuit after certain scan inputs. The primary block of code within this module initializes all control and test signals to zero (inactive state) and sets up the time format for simulation. It also incorporates an optional signal delay annotation via the 'sdf_annotate' function, if the 'SDFSCAN' directive is defined. The delay annotation helps to model interconnect and gate delays more accurately in 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge'. Overall, the 'test' module aids in thorough testing routines for the larger system by ensuring control over scan operations and effectively managing input and output signals.
