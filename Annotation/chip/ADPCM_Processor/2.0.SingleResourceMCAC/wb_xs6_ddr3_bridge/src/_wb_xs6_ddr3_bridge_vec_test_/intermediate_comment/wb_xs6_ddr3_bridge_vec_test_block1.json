    "block_comment": "This block initializes the simulation environment and configures initial parameters for a Verilog testbench. It starts by setting the time format to nanoseconds for simulation purposes. If SDFSCAN is defined, it annotates the test top module with the 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge_tsmc18_scan.sdf' file to model the delay and timing using SDF. After that, it initializes the clock, reset signal, and various scan inputs to 0. It configures the scan_enable and test_mode also as 0, indicating that at the beginning of the simulation, no scan operation is ongoing and the system is not in test_mode. The simulation then ends with calling $finish."
