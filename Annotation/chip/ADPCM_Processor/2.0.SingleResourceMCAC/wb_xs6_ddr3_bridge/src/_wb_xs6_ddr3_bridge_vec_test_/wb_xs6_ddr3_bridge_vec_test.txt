Module-level comment: The 'test' module interfaces with 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' for scan-based testing, controlling scan inputs 'scan_in0' - 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', 'test_mode', and 'reset'. It receives scan outputs 'scan_out0' - 'scan_out4', controls their state with internal registers, and optionally applies signal delay annotation for accurate modeling of delays, if 'SDFSCAN' is defined. The module primarily facilitates elaborate system testing.
