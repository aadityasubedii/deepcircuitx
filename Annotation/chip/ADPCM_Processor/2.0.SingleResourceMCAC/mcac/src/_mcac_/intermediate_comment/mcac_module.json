    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThis 'mcac' is a multi-functional control module designed for signal processing tasks. It takes a range of inputs including system level signals, scan-chain signals and data. The module outputs processed signals and data. Internally, it communicates via a wishbone bus interface, handling addressing, selecting and data transfer tasks. The design includes encoder (ENC_INST0) and decoder (DEC_INST0) instances for signal processing and a CFG_INT object for specific configuration setup. It provides both normal and test modes of operation."
