Comment: 
This block is a conditional statement for data width in a write-back architecture. If the data width (`WB_DWIDTH`) is set to 128, a register, `wb_rdata128`, of size 128 bits is declared. The block forms part of a dynamically configurable system where the data width of write-back register is determined based on system parameters.
