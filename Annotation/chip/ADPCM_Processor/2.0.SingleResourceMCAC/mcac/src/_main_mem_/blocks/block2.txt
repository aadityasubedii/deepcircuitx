Comment: 
The line of code assigns the output wire "o_wb_dat" with the value of another wire "wb_rdata32". This operation is essentially used for data transfer within a system. In the implementation, the `assign` keyword is used to evaluate the right-hand side expression and continuously assign the result to the left-hand side net "o_wb_dat".
