Comment: 
Without a specific block of Verilog code, I can't provide a specific comment. However, given an example such as a block of code for a basic 4-bit counter, I could craft a comment like this,

"This block of code functions as a 4-bit synchronous counter with a clear input. The counter increments its value on the rising edge of the clock signal if the clear input isn't asserted. When the clear input is asserted, the output value is reset to zero irrespective of the clock input."
