Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code implements a dual-stage pipeline with reset functionality that reads data asynchronously. At every positive edge of the reset or clock signal, the block checks whether the reset is active. If it is, it resets the pipeline registers (`start_read_d1`, `start_read_d2`) and the data register (`wb_rdata128`). Otherwise, it latches the `start_read` input to the first pipeline stage (`start_read_d1`), and the first stage to the second stage (`start_read_d2`). Additionally, if the first stage of the pipeline register (`start_read_d1`) is set, it updates the data register (`wb_rdata128`) with the current data read (`rd_data`).
