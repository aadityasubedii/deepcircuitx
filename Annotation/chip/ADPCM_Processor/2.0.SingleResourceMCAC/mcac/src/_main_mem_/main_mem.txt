Module-level comment: The 'main_mem' module models a primary memory block interfacing with the Wishbone bus. It performs read and write operations, supporting 32-bit and 128-bit widths, driven by synchronous clock and reset. The module manages memory operations controlled by input signals (i.e., addr, select, write enable, and data) and outputs data and status signals on the completion of these operations. Internally, various signals manage operation timings, read/write data, and memory block utilization. The functionality is achieved with conditions on the bus data width, resetting and initializing the memory block, controlling start signals for read/write operations, managing write operations with masked data, processing read operations, and coordinating Wishbone strobe signal.
