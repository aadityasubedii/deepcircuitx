    "block_comment": "This block handles memory read-write operations in a hardware design. It operates under two conditional flag states: reset and clock (clk) cycle. If reset, it initialises the write enable, write mask, write data, and memory address to zero. It also resets a RAM array. In the non-reset state, or normal running condition, the block deals with data manipulation and storage. It sets write enable according to the 'start_write' flag, determines write mask based on the value of address bits, and repeats the input data four times as write data. The memory address is decided according to the 'i_mem_ctrl' flag. If write enable is active, it stores the masked write data in RAM on the needed address, and gives an option of debug message for a memory write operation."
