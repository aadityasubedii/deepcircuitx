The input parameters define the data width and selection width for the bus. The module includes input/output declarations for the WB signals and operates as a synchronous design with respect to a given clock and reset. It can handle both read and write operations, where the write width is determined by the WB_DWIDTH parameter, supporting both 32-bit and 128-bit widths. The address of the memory operation and the selection mask are controlled by the inputs i_wb_adr and i_wb_sel respectively. The memory data for writes and reads are i_wb_dat and o_wb_dat respectively. The memory model includes i_mem_ctrl, test_mode, scan_enable input ports which control the testing modes of the model. This module also includes debugging functionality as indicated by the inclusion of the AMBER_MEMIF_DEBUG macro in the writing process."

It initializes the module state.\n3. scan_enable - Scan Enable signal is used when the system needs to enter the scan mode for testing.\n4. test_mode - Test mode signal is used when the system needs to function in a test mode.\n5. i_mem_ctrl - If this signal is high, it chooses a memory block whose address control bits are less.\n6. i_wb_adr - Wishbone address. It is used for read/write memory operations.\n7. i_wb_sel - Wishbone select. It enables specific byte lanes for memory operations.\n8. i_wb_we - Wishbone write enable. When high, a write operation is performed.\n9. i_wb_dat - Wishbone data. It inputs the data that needs to be written to memory.\n10. i_wb_cyc - Wishbone cycle. It is used to indicate the beginning and end of an access cycle.\n11. i_wb_stb - Wishbone strobe. It is used to indicate a valid data transfer cycle.\n\nExplanation: All these input ports function in synchronization with clk signal and they play a specific role in the memory read/write operation cycle.\n\nOutput ports:\n1. o_wb_dat - Wishbone data. It reads the data from the memory.\n2. o_wb_ack - Wishbone acknowledge. Indicates that a valid data transfer cycle is complete.\n3. o_wb_err - Wishbone error. It is used to indicate that an error occurred during the data transfer cycle.\n\nExplanation: These output ports are used to extract data from the memory and to signal the successful completion of it, they also function in synchronization with clk and also provide an error check mechanism."
