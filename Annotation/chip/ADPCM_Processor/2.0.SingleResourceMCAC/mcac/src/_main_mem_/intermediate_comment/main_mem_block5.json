    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a bit masking operation on the write-data array (`wr_data`). During each iteration of the loop, it selects a byte (8 bits) of the read-data array (`rd_data`) if the corresponding entry in the write-mask array (`wr_mask`) is true. Otherwise, it takes from the write-data array. Hence, the loop creates a byte-wise selective merge of the read and write arrays, governed by the write-mask."
