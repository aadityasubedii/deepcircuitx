Module-level comment: The 'tb_uart' module is a simulated UART interface for testing, handling data transmission and reception. It operates via input (clk, reset, scan_enable, test_mode, i_uart_cts_n, i_uart_rxd) and output (o_uart_txd, o_uart_rts_n) ports and maintains internal controls through signals for timing, state management, and FIFO buffering. The module also includes segments for parameter definition, state machine logic for both receiving and transmitting, and FIFO status checks. Overall 'tb_uart' seamlessly executes UART functioning for testing scenarios.
