    "block_comment": "This block of code deals with the detection of a negative edge start bit in a received transmission line data stream. It uses a bitwise AND operation, comparing the second bit (position [1]) and the negation of the first bit (position [0]) in the 'rx_tap' array, whilst also ensuring that the receive state ('rx_state') is in its initial state '2'h0'. This means the code will only flag ('rx_start_negedge') a start bit detection when a falling (negative) edge is observed and the receiver is ready in the idle state to start capturing data."
