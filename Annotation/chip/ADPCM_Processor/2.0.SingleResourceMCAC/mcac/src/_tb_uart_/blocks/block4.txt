Comment: 
This block of code manages the `rx_bit_count` variable in a UART receiver module. On the rising edge of either `reset` or `clk_uart`, `rx_bit_count` is reset to 0. The code also handles the cases where a complete byte has been received (`rx_bit_count` equals 9) or if a falling edge is detected on `rx_start` by resetting the `rx_bit_count`. If neither of these conditions applies, `rx_bit_count` increments by one.
