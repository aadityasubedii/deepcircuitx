This code block represents a UART communication protocol's receiver part. Implementing the core logic of asynchronous serial data reception, the block takes inputs of reset, clock, and UART input signal. Upon a rising edge of the reset or UART clock signal, if a reset occurs, all the internal states are reset. Otherwise, it samples the UART receive data and goes through different states for processing the serially transmitted bits. This is realized using a finite state machine with three possible states (0, 1, 2), taking decisions on state transitions and data processing based on conditions such as, detecting start bit of a frame, or reaching 3 repeated samples of start bit, or after processing a byte. It sequentially constructs the byte and eventually writes each successfully processed byte (excluding carriage return and line feed characters) to the standard output.
