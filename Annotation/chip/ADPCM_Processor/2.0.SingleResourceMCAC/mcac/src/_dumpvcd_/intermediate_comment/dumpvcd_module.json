    "module": "Module-level comment: \n// The 'dumpvcd' module is a part of the Amber open-source core testbench, designed to generate VCD files for system analysis and debugging. It monitors internal variables and registers, creating a VCD file at a declared file path. The module operates procedurally without explicit I/O ports. Using 'initial' and 'always' blocks, it controls the start, end and potential automatic termination of the VCD dump process based on clock-tick count. Its inclusion is optional and controlled using a compiler directive."
