This block manages simulation data dumps and testing termination for the `U_DECOMPILE` module. On every rising edge of `U_DECOMPILE.i_clk`, it checks the current `clk_count` to determine if it's time for data dump or termination. At `clk_count` of 10 and `U_DECOMPILE.clk_count == AMBER_DUMP_START + 0`, it turns on the data dump (`$dumpon`). At `clk_count` of 20 and `U_DECOMPILE.clk_count == AMBER_DUMP_START + AMBER_DUMP_LENGTH`, it turns off the data dump (`$dumpoff`). If `AMBER_TERMINATE` is defined, it triggers automatic test termination after the data dump has completed. The block communicates each action via the `$display` command.
