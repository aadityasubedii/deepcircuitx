    "module": "Module-level comment: This 'test' module is a top-level testbench for the 'mcac' module, utilizing various register-based and wire-based signals to stimulate and test the lower-level 'mcac' module. Initialization and potential test control parameters are specified through signals like 'clk', 'reset', 'test_mode', 'scan_in' series and 'scan_enable'. The 'mcac' module is connected via inputs/outputs relating to scan chain outputs, encoding/decoding functions, UART and Wishbone bus operations. An optional SDF annotation is used for precise timing verification based on the 'SDFSCAN' macro. Variants in functionality occur due to absence of complete test sequences."
