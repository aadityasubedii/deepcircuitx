    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code primarily handles the initialization of the simulation environment (testbench) and the variables used in the design. It sets up time formatting for the simulation, and if the macro \"SDFSCAN\" is defined, it annotates the design with SDF timing information. The code then sets the initial value of clock, reset, various scan inputs, scan enable, and the test mode to zero. The $finish keyword, occurring at the end, signifies the termination of the simulation once all initial settings are configured."
