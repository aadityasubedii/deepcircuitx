    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily works as a controller for registering start and validation signals for a program based on incoming email status. The operations are triggered at the positive edge of 'reset' or 'clk'. If 'reset' signal is high, all the flags 'program_start', 'e_mail', and 'd_mail' are set to '0'. However, if 'config_done' signal is high and 'program_start' is off, it processes the incoming emails by writing the address, setting and resetting the 'rs' signal twice for both 'd_mail' and 'e_mail', and triggering 'd_mail' and 'e_mail' flags if 'r_data' signal is high. If both emails are valid, 'program_start' flag is finally set to '1'."
