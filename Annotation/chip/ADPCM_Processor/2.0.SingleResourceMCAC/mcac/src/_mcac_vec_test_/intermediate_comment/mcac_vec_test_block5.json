    "block_comment": "The provided block of code initializes and loads data from a specified `'BOOT_MEM_FILE'` at the system's reset event. On the `U_SYSTEM.reset` signal's rising edge, it waits for a certain number of negative clock (`U_SYSTEM.clk`) edges. After ensuring the file's accessibility, it reads every line, performs alignment and checks for certain conditions before processing the data within each valid line. For non-comment lines, if the line starts with '@', it extracts address and data information to update the memory status of both encryption and decryption instances. The block also includes error checking components to display format errors encountered during file reading. After parsing all lines, it logs the number of lines read and initialize certain simulation parameters, including 'amber25' as core string, and it also opens a log file in append mode."
