    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a clock cycle counter. Upon each positive edge of the system clock (`U_SYSTEM.clk`), the `clk_count` register value gets incremented by 1. This behavior is achieved by the always block syntax in Verilog, that responds to the specified sensitivity list, in this case, the rising edge of the system clock."
