    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block defines a one-bit register named `tdmo_fs_prev_e`. As it's a register, it is capable of storing a binary value, specifically 0 or 1. Its functionality and use case might vary according to other parts of the whole Verilog code and can't be determined from this single line. Its value can be set and accessed within the Verilog design and can be used in various situations like storing a state, holding a value, or being part of a larger logic construct."
