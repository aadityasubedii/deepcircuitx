    "block_comment": "The given block code represents a declaration of a wire named `tie_in`. It is also utilizing conditional compilation by the means of `ifdef directive. The block will only be compiled if the macro `TIE_IN` is previously defined. This is useful for managing design variations and debugging by reusing same design and enabling or disabling sections of code. However, without the additional blocks of code that might come after `ifdef TIE_IN`, the specific functionality in this case could vary."
