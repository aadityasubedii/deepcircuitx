    "block_comment": "The block of code handles routing for three signals - dec_i_clk, dec_in, and dec_fs_in - based on the condition of a specific 'tie_in' value. The 'tie_in' variable is used as a control signal. If 'tie_in' is high (1), the signals are tied to their corresponding 'enc_i_' signals. However, if 'tie_in' is low (0), 'dec_i_clk' is assigned to 'enc_s_clk' and 'dec_in' and 'dec_fs_in' are assigned to 'dec_i' and 'dec_i_fs' respectively. This technique allows for dynamic switching between two sets of signals (dec and enc_i) based on the logic level of 'tie_in'."
