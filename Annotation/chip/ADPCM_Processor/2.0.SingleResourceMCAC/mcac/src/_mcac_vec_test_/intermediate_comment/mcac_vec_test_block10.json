    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a state-machine driver for a digital logic decoder system. It is primarily triggered by the rising edge of either a reset or a `dec_i_clk` signal. During the reset state or when `program_start` is not acknowledged, it initializes the test, bit and character counters to predefined values. The logic then advances the character and test counters based on certain conditions and assigns the `dec_i` and `dec_i_fs` based on the counters' states. The code also supports single-channel operations via the `SINGLECHANNEL` directive. In this mode, the `dec_i` only accepts `data_in_vec_d` at the respective test and bit counters when the character counter is zero. Otherwise, `dec_i` is zero. The same process applies for the multi-channel mode but without the character counter restriction."
