    "block_comment": "This block of code is a digital logic design implemented in Verilog for data capturing and test error reporting under reset or start conditions. The design leverages always block triggered by the positive edge of reset and negative edge of the `enc_i_clk` clock signal. In the reset or program start condition, it initializes all internal registers to their default states. In operation mode, it uses nested if-else statements to capture data, perform error checks, and conduct test counts across different channels. Furthermore, this block implements different error checking functionalities under the preprocessor directives '`ifdef ERRORCHECK`' and '`ifdef SINGLECHANNEL`', where it compares outputs against expected results and displays error messages if a discrepancy is found. Upon reaching the end of the test loop, a completion message is displayed and the execution is terminated."
