    "module": "Module-level comment: This testbench module verifies an \"Amber\" core hardware design by simulating memory loading, clock generation, and encoder/decoder functionality. It loads boot and main memory, configures system parameters, generates test vectors, and checks outputs against expected values. The module implements UART simulation, scan chain testing, and error checking for both encoder and decoder paths, using various internal signals and counters to manage test sequences and data flow."
