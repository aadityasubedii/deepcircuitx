    "block_comment": "The block of code declares two register variables, `tdmo_fs_prev_d` and `captured_data_d`. `tdmo_fs_prev_d` is presumably used to store the value of a state-machine or status from the previous clock cycle, while `captured_data_d` appears to hold some form of data that has been captured, possibly by some form of data capture mechanism. Exact details of their functionality would be dependent on their usage within the wider module.\n"
