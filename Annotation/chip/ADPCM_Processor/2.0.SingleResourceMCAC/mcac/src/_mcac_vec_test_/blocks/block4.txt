Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code loads main memory values from files for an encoder and a decoder. On reset, the block reads each line from the specified files (`ENC_MAIN_MEM_FILE` and `DEC_MAIN_MEM_FILE`), checks the proper format for each line, and stores the memory address and data read. For both encoder and decoder memories, addresses are extracted by converting obtained hexadecimal strings and the memory is filled with the read data. The block also includes detailed error checkers for file opening and line reading process. In case of error, it will provide a formatted error message for further debugging.
