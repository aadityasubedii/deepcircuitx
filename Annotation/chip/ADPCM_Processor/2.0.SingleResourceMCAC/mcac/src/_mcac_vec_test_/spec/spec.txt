Module name: test. Module specification: This testbench module is designed to verify the functionality of a hardware design, likely a microcontroller or processor system, with a focus on testing an "Amber" core. It sets up simulation parameters, loads memory contents, generates clock signals, and performs various tests on the design under test. The module has input ports for clocks (clk, uart_clk), reset, scan chains, and encoder/decoder signals, and output ports for scan chain results. Internal signals include memory file handling variables, UART interface signals, configuration registers, and test vectors. The module is structured with sections for memory loading, clock generation, encoder/decoder testing, UART simulation, and error checking. It includes functionality for loading boot and main memory, configuring system parameters, generating input stimuli, and checking output results against expected values. The testbench handles both encoder and decoder testing, as well as UART and memory interface simulations
