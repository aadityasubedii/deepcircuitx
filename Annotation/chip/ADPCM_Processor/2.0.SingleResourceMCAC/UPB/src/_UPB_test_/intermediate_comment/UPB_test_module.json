    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\n// The 'test' module acts as a testbench for the 'UPB' module. It defines and initializes certain control and data signals (including clock, reset, test inputs, and mode-control signals), and assigns them to the 'UPB' module. Outputs reflect the 'UPB' state. The code section controlling 'SDF' may guide the simulation. Execution ends by resetting all signals and terminating the simulation."
