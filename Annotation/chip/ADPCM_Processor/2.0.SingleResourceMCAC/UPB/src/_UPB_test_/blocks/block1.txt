This block initializes the simulation environment and sets default starting values for various signals. In the provided Verilog RTL code, initially the time format for simulation is set to 'ns' for displaying timescale with 2 digits after the decimal point. If SDFSCAN is defined, it annotates the specified SDF file onto the given module path. Various digital signals including clock, reset, scan inputs, scan_enable, and test_mode are all initialized to zero. Finally, the simulation ends with the $finish command.
