    "block_comment": "The block initializes a set of string arrays. Each array represents a different aspect of a system such as rates, laws, operations, types, and models. For instance, 'rates' indexes different set speeds, 'laws' archives compressions laws, 'operations' array holds operation modes, 'types' stores types of system position setups and finally 'models' comprises encoding and decoding methods. Each array is filled with a series of unique string values that presumably correspond to different configurations/options available in the system model. This block fills these arrays with their respective set of predefined values upon initialization."
