    "module": "Module-level comment: This is the 'test' module for system-level testing of a Verilog design instantiated by the 'UPB' module, simulating various configurations and comparing outputs against expected results. It uses inputs such as 'Un', 'DQn', 'Bn', 'rate_in', and test mode signals to steer the operation and outputs like 'scan_out' and 'BnP' to verify the results. Internally, arrays like 'Uns', 'DQns', 'Bns', and 'BnPs' stage the test data and loops governed by 'rate', 'model', 'law', 'operation', and 'type' cycle through all test scenarios."
