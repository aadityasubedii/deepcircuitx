    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a periodic clock signal with a period defined by the `CLK_PERIOD` macro. The `always` keyword means that this block is continuously evaluated, and the `#(`CLK_PERIOD/2) clk = ~clk;` command inverses the clk signal every half period, simulating the rising and falling edges of a physical clock signal."
