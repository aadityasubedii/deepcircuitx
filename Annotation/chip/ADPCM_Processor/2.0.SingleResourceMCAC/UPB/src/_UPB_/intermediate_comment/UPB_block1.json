    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for the addition of two input signals, Bn and UBn. It leverages Verilog's 'always' keyword to continuously monitor the value changes of inputs Bn and UBn. With any change in these signal values, the block calculates the sum, \"Bn + UBn\", which gets assigned to the BnP signal using a non-blocking assignment operator (<=). This approach ensures asynchronous updating, providing accurate computation and signal transmission in the digital hardware circuit."
