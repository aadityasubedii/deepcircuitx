    "module": "Module-level comment: The UPB module performs accumulator-like operations using input signals Bn, Un, and DQn, generating the output BnP. BnP is calculated as Bn plus the sum of UGBn and ULBn. UGBn and ULBn are determined by specific conditional constructs based on DQnMAG, BnS, and Un, and Bn, BnS, and rate_in respectively. The module includes testability features enabled by test_mode, scan_in0 - scan_in4, and scan_enable input signals and scan_out0 - scan_out4 output signals."
