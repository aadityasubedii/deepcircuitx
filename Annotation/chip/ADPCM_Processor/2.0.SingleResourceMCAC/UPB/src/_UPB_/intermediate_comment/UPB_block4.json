    "block_comment": "This block of code supervises changes in two-bit signals DQnMAG and Un. When DQnMAG is zero, it sets the 16-bit UGBn to zero. If Un is true, UGBn is set to its maximum negative value (16'hFF80). If Un is not true, UGBn is set to a minimum positive value (16'h0080). This block, therefore, performs the function of controlling the value of UGBn based on the state of DQnMAG and Un."
