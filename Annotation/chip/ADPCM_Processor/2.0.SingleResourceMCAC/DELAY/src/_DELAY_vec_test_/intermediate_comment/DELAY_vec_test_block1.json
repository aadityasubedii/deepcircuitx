    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes the system for digital simulation. It sets the time format, optionally applies Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotations using an if-def conditional statement, and initializes a set of variables related to clock, reset, and test modes to binary 0. Furthermore, it uses the $finish command to stop the current simulation after the initializations."
