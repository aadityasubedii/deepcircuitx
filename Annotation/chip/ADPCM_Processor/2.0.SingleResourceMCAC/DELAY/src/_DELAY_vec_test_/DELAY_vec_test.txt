Module-level comment: The 'test' module is a testbench simulating the `DELAY` module, initializing input registers and output wires, then applying them to a `DELAY` instance. Handles the system clock (`clk`), reset, test inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), scan enable, and test mode operations. Retrieves output responses from `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`. An optional Standard Delay Format (SDF) file can be annotated during delay testing. All registers are reset to 0 at initiation, terminating the test simulation sequentially.
