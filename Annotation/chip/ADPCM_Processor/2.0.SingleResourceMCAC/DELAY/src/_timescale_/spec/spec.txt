The information provided is insufficient to generate a complete and detailed specification of a module. The provided code "`timescale 1ns / 1ns" is a directive in Verilog and does not by itself define a module. 

It doesn't contain information about a specific module, its functionality, the input and output ports, internal signals, or the blocks of the code. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a correct and meaningful specification.

Once the full Verilog code for a specific module is provided, with details about its function, inputs, outputs, internal signals, and sub-modules or processes (if any), a detailed specification can be provided.
