    "module": "Module-level comment: \nThis module, 'test', serves as a testbench for two instances of a 'DELAY' module. It initializes the DELAY modules with inputs and checks their output against expected values. Inputs include clock, reset, testing, and scan signals. Test verdicts are displayed as error messages. The test runs under different modes, controlled via preprocessor directives. Internal signals for loop counters and signal width are used. It concludes with a \"TEST COMPLETE\" message. This enables verification of DELAY module's functionality under various configurations for hardware design."
