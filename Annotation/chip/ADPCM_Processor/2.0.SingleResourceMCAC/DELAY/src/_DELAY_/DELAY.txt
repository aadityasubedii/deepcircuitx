Module-level comment: The DELAY module delays the input signal 'X' by 31 clock cycles using a 31-stage shift register 'R'. On each clock cycle, 'X' is loaded into R[0] and the contents of 'R' are shifted forward, delaying the input by 31 clock cycles on output 'Y'. A synchronous reset sets 'R' and 'Y' to 'RSTVAL'. Unused scan and test signals are included in the inputs and outputs.
