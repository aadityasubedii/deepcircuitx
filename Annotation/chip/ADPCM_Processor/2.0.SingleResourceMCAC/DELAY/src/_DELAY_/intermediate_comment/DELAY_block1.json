    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs shift register operations and acts as a resetting mechanism. The block waits for a positive clock edge or a reset signal. If a reset signal is received, the block resets the signal Y and the components of the Array R with values from RSTVAL. Otherwise, at every positive clock edge, the block shifts right all values of Array R and the value from R[30] is passed to the signal Y while R[0] receives new incoming data X."
