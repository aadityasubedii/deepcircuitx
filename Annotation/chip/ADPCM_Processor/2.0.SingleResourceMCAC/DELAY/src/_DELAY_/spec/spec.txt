Module name: DELAY. 

Module specification: The DELAY module is designed to delay the input signal 'X' by 31 clock cycles. It accomplishes this delay using an internal shift register, denoted by the array 'R' of 31 stages (from R[0] to R[30]). On each clock cycle, the input signal 'X' is loaded into the first stage R[0] while the content of each stage is shifted to its subsequent stage. This results in the input 'X' appearing on the output 'Y' after 31 clock cycles. The module can be reset synchronously, which sets all stages of the shift register 'R' and the output 'Y' to the reset value 'RSTVAL'. The input ports for the module include: the reset signal, the clock signal, scan input signals (scan_in0 to scan_in4), scan enable signal, test mode signal, and the input data 'X'. The output ports include: scan output signals (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and the delayed output 'Y'. Note that the scan inputs, scan outputs, scan enable, and test mode are deemed unused in the logic of the Verilog code provided. The code cleanly separates the processes involving reset operation and normal operation under clear always blocks. The first block handles the reset condition that loads the shift register and output 'Y' with the reset value 'RSTVAL'. The second block handles normal operation that sees the shift operation and loading of new input into the shift register.
