    "module": "Module-level comment: FLOATA is a Verilog module that converts an input 16-bit number (DQ) into a floating-point format. This is achieved by partitioning DQ into its sign (DQS), magnitude (MAG), exponent (EXP), based on MAG's highest non-zero bit, and mantissa (MANT), calculated by right-shifting MAG by EXP. The resulting floating-point output (DQ0) is a concatenation of DQS, EXP, and MANT. The module also includes unutilized scan-chain testing input and output ports."
