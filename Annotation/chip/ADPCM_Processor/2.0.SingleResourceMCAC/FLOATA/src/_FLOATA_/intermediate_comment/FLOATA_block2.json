    "block_comment": "The block assigns a value to the `MANT` variable based on the value of `MAG` and `EXP`. If `MAG` equals `0`, `MANT` is assigned `32`. Otherwise, `MANT` gets shifted right by `EXP` places. This shifting occurs after appending `6'b000000` (six zeros) to the `MAG` value, enhancing precision while computing the mantissa."
