    "block_comment": "This block of code combines three values into a concatenated bitstream stored in 'DQ0'. It uses the Verilog 'assign' keyword to continuously assign the combined bitstream of 'DQS', 'EXP', and 'MANT' to 'DQ0'. The concatenation is achieved using the '{ }' syntax which combines its inner elements into a single bitstream from left to right."
