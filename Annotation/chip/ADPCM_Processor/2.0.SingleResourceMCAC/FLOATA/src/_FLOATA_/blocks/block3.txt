Comment: 
This block performs leading zero count operation on a 15-bit binary number (MAG). The operation observes the first '1' (from left to right) in 15-bit binary number and assigns the distance from the right edge (least significant bit side) to EXP. If the most significant bit (on the left) is a '1' the count (EXP) equals 15; if the second MSB is '1' (and the rest of the bits are '0' or 'don't care'), the count is 14; and so on, up to 0. If there is no '1' in the number (default case), the count becomes 0.
