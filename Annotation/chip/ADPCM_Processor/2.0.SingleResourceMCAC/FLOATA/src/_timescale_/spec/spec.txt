Given the information provided, I must market that there is no Verilog module defined in the shared code. The line "`timescale 1ns / 1ps" is a directive used in Verilog to define the time scale for simulation, it's not a module.

The key aspects requested, like module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, and blocks/sections can't be derived from this directive. We would need a complete Verilog code to give such detailed specification. It'd be helpful if you could provide a detailed Verilog module.

For example, if you provided a code snippet like this: 

```verilog
module Example (input1, input2, output1);
    input wire input1;
    input wire input2;
    output wire output1;
    
    wire internalSignal; 

    // Code logic here...

endmodule
```

Then, I could generate a specification as follows:

Module name: Example

Module specification: 
This module, named 'Example', has two input ports and one output port. The inputs, 'input1' and 'input2', are intended to receive binary signals. The output, 'output1', emits the result based on the processing of the input signals internally. The internal signal, 'internalSignal' is used for internal computation in the logic code section, which has not been detailed here. Further insights could be extracted if more detailed code or its functionality is provided.

Right now, using the provided '`timescale 1ns / 1ns' code line, it's not possible to generate a useful module specification as it doesn't represent a Verilog module.
