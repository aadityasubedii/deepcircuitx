This block of code is a clock generator. It generates a periodic clock signal with a period defined by the macro `CLK_PERIOD`. The operation is implemented using always block, which toggles the state of `clk` after every half period of `CLK_PERIOD`, creating a square wave to imitate the behavior of a digital clock signal.
