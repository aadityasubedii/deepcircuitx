    "block_comment": "This block of code implements testbench setup and initial settings for a simulation. It starts by setting the time format to nanoseconds. If the SDFSCAN is defined, it performs an SDF annotation on the defined file. Afterwards, it initializes multiple single-bit variables including clock, reset, several scan inputs, scan enable, and test mode, to logic low. The setup ends with a `$finish` command indicating the end of these initial tasks."
