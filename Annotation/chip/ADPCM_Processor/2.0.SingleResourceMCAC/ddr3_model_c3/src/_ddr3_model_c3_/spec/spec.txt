Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module represents a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM (Double Data Rate 3 Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory) device. It simulates the functionality and timing characteristics of a DDR3 memory, including operations such as read, write, refresh, and various memory commands. The module has input ports for control signals (rst_n, ck, ck_n, cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank selection (ba, addr), and data mask (dm_tdqs). It features inout ports for data (dq) and data strobe (dqs, dqs_n) signals, and an output port for termination data strobe (tdqs_n). Internal signals include timing parameters, state variables, and pipelines for managing operations. The code is organized into
