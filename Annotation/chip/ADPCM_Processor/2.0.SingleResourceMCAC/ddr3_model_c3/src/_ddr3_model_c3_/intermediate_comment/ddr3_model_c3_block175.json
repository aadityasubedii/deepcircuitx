    "block_comment": "This block monitors and alerts for reset (RST_N) pulse width violations. It's triggered on positive edges of the reset, checks if the system's $time is greater than a set limit of 100000. If so and the previous stored time (tm_rst_n) plus 100000 exceeds $time, it flags an error message indicating the violation and how much it was off by. Operation time for the reset pulse is then updated (tm_rst_n = $time) for later checks."
