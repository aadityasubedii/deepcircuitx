    "block_comment": "This block acts as a dynamic checker for two types of timing violations pertaining to the On-Die Termination (ODT) signal in a memory system namely Input High voltage time(tIH) and Input Pulse Width(tIPW). When the reset signal is not active, ODT is enabled and the system is not in self-refresh mode, the code checks for timing violations. If the time elapsed since the last positive clock signal is less than the min required voltage high time (tIH), or if the time elapsed since the last ODT signal is less than the min required pulse width (tIPW), the code raises an error message highlighting the violation. After each check cycle, the current time is stored as the time of ODT incidence for the next check cycle."
