    "block_comment": "This block instantiates the dqs_pos_timing_check(19) upon the negative edge of the bit 19 of dqs_in. The always block is sensitive to the falling edge of dqs_in[19], triggering the procedure whenever a transition from high to low is detected on the 20th bit of the dqs_in data input."
