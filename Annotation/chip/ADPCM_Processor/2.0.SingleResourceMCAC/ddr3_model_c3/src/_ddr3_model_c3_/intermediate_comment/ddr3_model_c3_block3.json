    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the sampling of data-queue signals (dqs) on the rising edge of the 30th element in the `dqs_in` array. This is achieved by triggering the `dqs_neg_timing_check` function whenever there is a positive-edge transition detected in `dqs_in[29]`. The function is likely designed to verify or adjust the timing of the transmitted or received signals in the 'negative' phase of the clock cycle for optimal data integrity."
