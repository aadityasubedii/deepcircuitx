    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a task 'dqs_even_receiver' which handles incoming data for the even data strobe (DQS) lines in the memory interface. It uses the input index 'i' to determine which bits to mask and operate on. In the task, a bit mask is created by shifting a pre-set number of '1' bits (`DQ_PER_DQS`) by the input index amount. If the even DQS line associated with the input index is active, it handles the data mask (DM) input and data (DQ) input differently based on whether the DQS is enabled or not. If enabled, 'dm_in_pos' is set to low, otherwise, it takes the value of 'dm_in[i]'. Finally, the DQ input is processed, with the result being stored in 'dq_in_pos'."
