    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code initiates a timing check for command-address signals in the system. The always block uses the 5th bit of the 'addr_in' input signal as a sensitivity list, implying this check occurs when there's a change in this particular bit. The function 'cmd_addr_timing_check' is invoked with a parameter of '11', indicating that the timing check procedure is performed with specified conditions defined within this function."
