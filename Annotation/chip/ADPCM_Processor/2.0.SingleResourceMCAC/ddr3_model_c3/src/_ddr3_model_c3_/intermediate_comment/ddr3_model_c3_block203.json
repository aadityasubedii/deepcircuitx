    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to call the procedure 'dqs_even_receiver' with the parameter '5' whenever there is a rising edge (positive edge) detected on the 'dqs_even[ 5]' signal. Specifically, 'always @' denotes sensitivity list in Verilog which triggers or executes the block of code inside it based on changes on its elements. Here, 'posedge' refers to the positive or rising edge of a signal. So, when 'dqs_even[ 5]' signal has a positive transition, 'dqs_even_receiver( 5)' is executed."
