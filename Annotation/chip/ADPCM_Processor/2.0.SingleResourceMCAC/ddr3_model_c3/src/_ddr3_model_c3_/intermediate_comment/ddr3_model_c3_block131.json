    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a task `dq_timing_check` in Verilog which checks for violations in the timing margins on the DQ (Data Queue) bit as specified by data handling (tDH) and data input pulse width (tDIPW) timings. The checking is only enabled when the `dqs_in_valid` signal is high. Any violations are reported with \u00e0 display function, providing time, dq bit, and how early the dq bit arrived. Additionally, the task sets certain DQ signals for future comparisons and records the current simulation time for every DQ bit for future checking."
