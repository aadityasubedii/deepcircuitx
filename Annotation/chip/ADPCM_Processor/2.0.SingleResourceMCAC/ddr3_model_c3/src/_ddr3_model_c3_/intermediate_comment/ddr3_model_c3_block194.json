    "block_comment": "This block of code is a declaration of a D flip-flop triggered by the positive edge of dqs_even[14]. The function invoked on each positive edge is dqs_even_receiver. When the 14th bit of the dqs_even signal rises from a low to high state, it triggers the dqs_even_receiver function for the 14th bit. The outcome of function operation is not defined within this block. This flip-flop thus captures and stores data at periods determined by the 14th bit of the dqs_even digital signal."
