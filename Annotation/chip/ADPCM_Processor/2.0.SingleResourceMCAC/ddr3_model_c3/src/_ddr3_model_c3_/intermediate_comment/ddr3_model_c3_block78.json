    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a timing check on the 53rd bit (index 52) of the input vector 'dq_in'. It utilizes the user-defined function 'dq_timing_check' using the sensitivity list approach to instantly react to any changes in the state of 'dq_in[52]'. Any time there is a change in this bit of 'dq_in', 'dq_timing_check' with the argument '52' is called, effectively enabling the system to keep track of and verify the timing for this specific bit of the input vector.\n"
