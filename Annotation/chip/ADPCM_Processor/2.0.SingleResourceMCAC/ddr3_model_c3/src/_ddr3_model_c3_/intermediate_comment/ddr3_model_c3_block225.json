    "block_comment": "The function `open_bank_file` is for opening a bank file based on the specified bank number. It constructs the filename using the `bank` parameter and a directory stored in the variable `tmp_model_dir`. Then, it tries to open the file for reading and writing. If it fails to open the file, it displays an error message and ends the execution. However, if successful, it displays an information message (only when `DEBUG` is true) and assigns the file descriptor to `open_bank_file` and returns it. This specific block is useful for processing data in multiple bank files in a memory-efficient way."
