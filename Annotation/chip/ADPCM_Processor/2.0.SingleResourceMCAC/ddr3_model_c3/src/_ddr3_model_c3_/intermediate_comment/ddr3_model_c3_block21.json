    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for DQS negative timing check. It identifies the negative edge of the 12th DQS input signal and triggers the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function for this signal. Implementing this functionality by using the 'always' keyword with the negedge event control ensures that the timing check happens whenever there's a falling edge detected on the DQS signal at index 11."
