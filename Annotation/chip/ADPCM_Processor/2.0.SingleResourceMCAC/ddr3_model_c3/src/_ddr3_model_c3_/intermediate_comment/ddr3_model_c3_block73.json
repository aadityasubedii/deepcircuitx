    "block_comment": "The block of code triggers a function called `dq_timing_check` whenever there is a change in the 58th bit of the dq_in signal. The function `dq_timing_check` is an edge detection mechanism, more specifically it checks for any transitions on the 58th bit of the 'dq_in' signal and executes the function every time this specific bit changes its state."
