    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a task in Verilog called 'chk_err'. The task primarily role is to check the timing constraints in a DDR SDRAM controller. It takes as input, parameters detailing the bank relationship, the bank ID, the previous command, and the current command to decide which error check to execute. This checking mechanism implemented as a 'casex' statement, each case representing a timing constraint. For each case, it checks if the conditions are violated, by comparing the system time and counter variables to the timing constraints specified. If the conditions are violated it prints an error message indicating the type of violation, the time of the violation and the command being executed."
