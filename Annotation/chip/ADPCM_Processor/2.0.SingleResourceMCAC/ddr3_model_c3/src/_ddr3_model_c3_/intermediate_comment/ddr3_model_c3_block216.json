    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL task implements a reset sequence for the parameters of a digital memory module. It initializes variables to control data quality (dq and dqs), write and read processes, various types of enable signals including output drives (odt), and settings for the dynamic on-die termination (dyn_odt). It also manages parameters related to active operations on memory banks, initialization and mode settings, DLL operation, power modes, and the pipeline stages for different operations. The reset task sets most of these variables to zero, indicating inactive, unused, or base state, with the exception of 'prev_cke' which is set to an undefined logic state 'x'. This initialization is performed using a standard iterative 'for' loop for the 'wdqs_pos_cntr' array and direct assignments for the rest of the variables."
