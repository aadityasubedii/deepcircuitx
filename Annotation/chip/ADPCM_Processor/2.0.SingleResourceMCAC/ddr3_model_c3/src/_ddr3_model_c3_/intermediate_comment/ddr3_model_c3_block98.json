    "block_comment": "The block of code functions as a data quality check at index 32 of the input array. Upon any change in the value at the 32nd index of the array 'dq_in', the procedure 'dq_timing_check(32)' is invoked to ensure the integrity of the data at that position. The implementation employs a simple sensitivity event control method to monitor real-time changes at the specific index in the array."
