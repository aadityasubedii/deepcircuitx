    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a function related to data timing checks in a digital system. Within the block, a function dqs_neg_timing_check is called on the positive edge (i.e., at the point when the signal transitions from low to high) of the 31st bit dqs_in signal, an array-like structure. This suggests that this function is employed to carry out a negative timing check for each positive edge cycle of the specific bit of the dqs_in input signal."
