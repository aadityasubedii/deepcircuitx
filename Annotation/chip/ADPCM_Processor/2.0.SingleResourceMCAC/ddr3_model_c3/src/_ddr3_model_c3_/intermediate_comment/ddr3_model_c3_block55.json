    "block_comment": "This block monitors for a positive edge on the 11th bit of the `dqs_in` bus. When the positive edge occurs, it triggers the `dqs_pos_timing_check` function with argument `10`. This is achieved via the `always @` block which is sensitive to changes in `dqs_in[10]`, and thereby ensures accurate event-driven simulations."
