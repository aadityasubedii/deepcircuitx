    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for monitoring the positive edge of the dqs_odd signal with index 1. Upon detecting this condition, it initiates the function 'dqs_odd_receiver' with '1' as the passing argument. This function's execution is synchronous to the rising edge of the 'dqs_odd[1]' signal in the array. Execution follows the highest level of priority for Verilog; this block only triggers upon observing changes in its sensitivity list, i.e., the posedge of 'dqs_odd[1]'."
