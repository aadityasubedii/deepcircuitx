    "block_comment": "This block initializes two elements of the 'dqs_string' array in the 'initial' block of the Verilog code. It is populating the array with two string values: \"DQS\" and \"DQS_N\". The \"initial\" keyword in Verilog means this block of code is executed only once at the start of the simulation. Once these array elements are initialized, they can be used later in the code wherever needed. "
