    "block_comment": "This block of block performs clock edge detection. Specifically, it detects the rising edge occurrence (positive edge) of the input clock signal 'ck_in'. The operation is accomplished using an 'always' block that is sensitive to the positive edge of 'ck_in'. On each occurrence of these events, the current value of 'ck_in' is stored into the 'diff_ck' signal. Essentially, this block acts as a one-cycle delay for the 'ck_in' signal, which can be useful in creating clock dividers or detecting clock edges."
