    "block_comment": "This block is a delay module activated by the chip select signal (cs_n). It uses a non-blocking assignment to assign a delay of a specified amount of time (BUS_DELAY) to the current value of the chip select signal (cs_n), and then assigns this delayed value to 'cs_n_in'. The always block ensures that this action is performed every time 'cs_n' changes state or value. This implementation may be used to account for signal propagation delays in the communication bus of a chip design."
