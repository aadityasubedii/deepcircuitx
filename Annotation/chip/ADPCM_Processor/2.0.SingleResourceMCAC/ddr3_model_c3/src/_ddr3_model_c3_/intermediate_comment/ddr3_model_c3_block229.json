    "block_comment": "The block defines a function `get_rtt_nom` which computes and returns a value based on the input `rtt`. The computation is done by performing divisions of a `RZQ` constant by several divisors, with the specific divisor chosen depending on the value of `rtt`. The `rtt` varies from 1 to 5, each value leading to a different division operation performed on `RZQ`. If `rtt` does not match the range from 1 to 5, a default value of 0 is returned.\n"
