    "block_comment": "The block is a floor function that outputs the largest integer less than or equal to a given number. It accepts an input real number, then checks if the number is less than its rounded integer form. If true, it subtracts one from the rounded form and assigns it as the output; else, it directly assigns the input as the floor output."
