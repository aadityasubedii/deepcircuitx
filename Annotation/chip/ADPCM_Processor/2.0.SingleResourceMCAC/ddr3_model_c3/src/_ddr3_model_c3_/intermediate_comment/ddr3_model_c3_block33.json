    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block serves to check timing violations for a DDR memory model in write mode. It performs checks based on various timing parameters such as tWLDQSEN, tDQSH, tDSH, and TDS. When the conditions trigger a possible violation, output messages are displayed. Specific conditions it tests include: comparing the current memory clock against a stored \"load mode\" clock, comparison of the current time against the rising edge of the write-data-strobe (DQS) signal, validating change on DQS input over a specific time period if DLL lock is valid, checking data-mask (DM) and data-bits (DQ) are valid within the setup time (TDS). If all checks pass, a timestamp is stored, and the previous DQS input is updated. If invalid latching edge occurs, an error is displayed."
