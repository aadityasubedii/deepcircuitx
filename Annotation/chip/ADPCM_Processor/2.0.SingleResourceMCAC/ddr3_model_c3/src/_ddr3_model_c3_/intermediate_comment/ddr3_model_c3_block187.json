    "block_comment": "This block handles the process of receiving data on the odd-indexed DQS line in synchronous mode. Upon each rising edge event of the 5th DQS line (indexing from 0), the function `dqs_odd_receiver()` with parameter 4 is called, which likely contains routine to process or simply store the bit received on this particular DQS channel. The implementation relies on edge-triggered event control in Verilog, which provides synchronization with data stream."
