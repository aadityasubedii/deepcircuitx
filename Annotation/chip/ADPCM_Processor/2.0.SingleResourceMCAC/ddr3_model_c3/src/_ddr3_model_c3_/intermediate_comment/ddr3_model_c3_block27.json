    "block_comment": "This block of code is implementing a timing check based on a negative edge occurrence on a specific bit of the `dqs_in` array. Specifically, the block is utilizing a sensitive always trigger that executes whenever there is a negative edge in the 5th bit of the `dqs_in` signal array, thereby calling the `dqs_neg_timing_check` function for this specific situation."
