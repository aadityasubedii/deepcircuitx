    "block_comment": "This block of code monitors the 25th bit of the dq_in signal; whenever it changes, it triggers the dq_timing_check function with the value '24' as argument. This is accomplished via the built-in 'always' control-flow construct in Verilog. The specific bit of dq_in that triggers the function is selected using array-like indexing, '[24]'."
