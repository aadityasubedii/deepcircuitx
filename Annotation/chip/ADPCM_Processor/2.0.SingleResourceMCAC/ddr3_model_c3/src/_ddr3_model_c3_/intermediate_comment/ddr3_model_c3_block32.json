    "block_comment": "This block of code is mainly responsible for triggering a timing check when the signal 'dqs_in' experiences a negative edge. In Verilog, 'always' block with the '@' specifies the event or condition that triggers the block, and 'negedge' is used as the trigger event for flip-flops on the falling edge or negative edge of a clock pulse. In this case, the system calls the function 'dqs_neg_timing_check' with parameter '0' when there is a negative edge in the 'dqs_in[0]' signal."
