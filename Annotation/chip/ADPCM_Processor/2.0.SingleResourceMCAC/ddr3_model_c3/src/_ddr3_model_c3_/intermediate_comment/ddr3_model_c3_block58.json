    "block_comment": "This block contains a statement in the Verilog RTL code that describes a timing event that is specific to device data flow. When there is a positive edge on the 8th bit of the 'dqs_in' array (Verilog arrays start at 0), this block executes the dqs_pos_timing_check function, passing the integer value of 7 as an argument, implying that it's examining the timing associated with the 8th data stream. Essentially, it is used for checking the timing of Positive-edge DQS data signals, ensuring the chip maintains synchronous data flow without any overlap in the DQS signals."
