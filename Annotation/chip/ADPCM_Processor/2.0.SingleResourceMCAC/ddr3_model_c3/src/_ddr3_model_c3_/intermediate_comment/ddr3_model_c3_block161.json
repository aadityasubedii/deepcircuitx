    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates a command address timing check whenever there's a change in the third bit of the 'addr_in' input. This function is accomplished using an 'always' block in Verilog that is sensitive to changes in 'addr_in[3]' and executes a function named 'cmd_addr_timing_check' with the argument '10'. The 'always' construct ensures continuous monitoring of the address input, and the function 'cmd_addr_timing_check' ensures accurate timing checks are performed for command and address signals."
