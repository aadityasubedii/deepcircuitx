    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to drive a timing check function whenever there is a falling edge (negative edge) on the ninth bit of the 'dqs_in' signal. The keyword 'always' in Verilog initiates a procedure when its control statement, here being the negative edge of 'dqs_in[8]', is true. This procedure, 'dqs_neg_timing_check', hence runs on every falling edge of the ninth bit of 'dqs_in'."
