    "block_comment": "The function calculates the absolute value of a real number. It checks if the input, arg, is less than zero. If it is, the function multiplies the input by -1 to convert it to a positive value. Otherwise, it directly assigns the input as the absolute value, given the input is greater than or equal to zero."
