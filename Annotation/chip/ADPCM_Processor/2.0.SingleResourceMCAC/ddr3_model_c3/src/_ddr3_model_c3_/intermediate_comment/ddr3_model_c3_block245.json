    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for introducing an artificial delay to the clock enable signal (`cke`) by a factor determined by `BUS_DELAY`. This delay implements in order to simulate the propagation delay in a real system, which can be crucial when considering synchronization and timing conditions. Specifically, it makes use of Verilog's non-blocking assignment (`<=`) to ensure that the delay is applied synchronously, meaning the new value of `cke_in` will be computed at this tick, but updated at the next tick of the clock. The delay factor `#BUS_DELAY` works as a placeholder for the actual delay amount."
