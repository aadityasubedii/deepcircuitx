    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a delay on the 'write enable' signal input (we_n). By using the Verilog non-blocking assignment '<=', it simulates the physical delay that would normally be caused by the hardware bus. The extent of this delay is determined by the constant BUS_DELAY, which would be defined elsewhere in the code."
