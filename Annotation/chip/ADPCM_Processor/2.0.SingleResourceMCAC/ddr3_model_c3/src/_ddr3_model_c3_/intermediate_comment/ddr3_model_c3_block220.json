    "block_comment": "The block reads data from a memory. It takes inputs describing the bank, row, and column to be read from and outputs the resulting data. A data address is generated by dividing a concatenation of the bank, row, and column numbers by the maximum burst length. In case of `MAX_MEM` being defined, address is obtained by concatenating row and column only. The data are then either read directly from a file associated with that address (in case of `MAX_MEM` being defined) or from a memory array at the associated index, returning either the memory value or a burst length set of 'X's depending on whether a valid index is found."
