    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a hardware trigger that sets off a timing verification function whenever a change is detected on the 12th bit of the 'dq_in' data input. The 'always' keyword in Verilog triggers an event-driven procedure that constantly listens for changes on the specified bits of 'dq_in'. After which, the 'dq_timing_check' function with the number '11' as its argument to monitor the state of the 12th bit is called each time such a change is detected. It helps in catching possible timing issues related to the specific 'dq_in' bit."
