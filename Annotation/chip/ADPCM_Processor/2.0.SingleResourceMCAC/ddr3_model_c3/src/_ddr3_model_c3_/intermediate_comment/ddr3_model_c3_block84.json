    "block_comment": "This block of code runs a timing check whenever there is a change to the 47th bit of dq_in (its indexes are 0-based with a size of 47). This check is performed by the function 'dq_timing_check()', which gets called upon with 46 passed as its argument. The function likely works by analyzing whether bit 46 has changed within a specific timing condition. Any non-compliance could likely point towards an operational anomaly that may need addressing."
