    "block_comment": "The block of code is an always block that triggers a function called `cmd_addr_timing_check(3)`. This function is invoked each time there's a level change in the `we_n_in` signal. The implementation of this block is straightforward, as it is listening for changes in the `we_n_in` signal to perform a timing check through the `cmd_addr_timing_check(3)` function, with `3` as a fixed argument. This timing check can be useful in managing and synchronizing operations in a hardware design."
