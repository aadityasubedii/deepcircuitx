    "block_comment": "This code block assigns distinct labels to an array of string variables, `cmd_addr_string`. The labels pertain to various memory commands and addresses used in a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) controller. The implementation uses an initial begin-end block to perform these assignments once at the start of the simulation. The labels include notations for control signals of a DRAM like \"CS_N\", \"RAS_N\", \"CAS_N\", \"WE_N\" and others which refer to chip select, row address strobe, column address strobe, and write enable signals. The rest of the assignments are for Bank Addresses (\"BA\") and Addresses (\"ADDR\") used in the DRAM operations.\n"
