    "block_comment": "This is a DQS (Data Strobe Signal) receiver block, specifically for the DQS odd signal. It operates at the positive edge of the DQS odd signal for the 9th signal (indexed as 8). The block calls the \"dqs_odd_receiver\" function at every positive edge of the \"dqs_odd[8]\" signal. This function is responsible for handling and processing the received DQS odd data line."
