    "block_comment": "This block of code is a timing check task in digital memory systems, specifically for latching data after a Write command. It takes the index 'i' of input 'dm' (DataMask) bits as an argument. If the 'dqs_in_valid' signal is true, it checks for violations of two timings - the Data Hold Time ('TDH') and the Data Input Pulse Width ('TDIPW'). If any violation is detected, an error message gets displayed with details of the violation. It also resets the check for 'TDIPW' violations in 'dm' bits after the check. The current simulation time is stored for corresponding 'dm' bit every time the task is called. This method enables dynamic validation of timing requirements during simulation."
