    "block_comment": "The block of code indicates a procedural block that triggers based on any changes in the 26th bit of the dq_in signal. The functionality of this block is to perform a timing check for the 26th bit of the dq_in signal. The procedure dq_timing_check is called with the bit index 25 as the argument every time there's a change detected in the 26th bit of dq_in, facilitating the timing check for this specific bit in the multi-bit signal."
