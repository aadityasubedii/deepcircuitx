    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates a function called `dqs_neg_timing_check` when there's a rising edge in the signal `dqs_in[23]`. In terms of implementation, an `always` block is being used to call the function `dqs_neg_timing_check` with the argument `23`, triggered by a positive edge (or rising edge) from the array `dqs_in[]` on the 23rd element. This mechanism is a common technique for flip-flop design or any other applications that requires a consistent sampling point in a clock cycle."
