    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for calling the `dm_timing_check` function whenever there is a change on the 12th bit of the `dm_in` input. The `always` keyword makes this block sensitive to changes of `dm_in[12]`, which means whenever the value of `dm_in[12]` changes, the `dm_timing_check(12)` function will be executed. This particular design pattern allows for real-time monitoring of a specific bit and proactive execution of related checks."
