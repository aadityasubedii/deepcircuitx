    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for monitoring changes in the 14th bit (index 13) of the `dq_in` signal and accordingly triggering the function `dq_timing_check` with argument 13. The `always @` hardware construct in Verilog is used to execute the underlying action whenever the specified signal (`dq_in[13]` in this case) changes. This block ensures that whenever the 14th bit of `dq_in` changes, a timing check is performed on it using `dq_timing_check`. This functionality is crucial to maintaining correct data transmission and synchronization in digital systems."
