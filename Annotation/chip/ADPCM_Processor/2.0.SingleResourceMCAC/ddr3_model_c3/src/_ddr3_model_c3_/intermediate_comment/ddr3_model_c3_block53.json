    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code schedules a function call to `dqs_pos_timing_check` with an argument of `12` at each positive edge of `dqs_in[12]`. The 'always' statement, combined with the @(posedge), is used to create a function call event that triggers on the occurrence of a rising edge on the 13th bit (array index `12`) of the `dqs_in` signal. This is often used in cases where a specific operation must be activated in sync with a changing digital signal, frequently employed in timing critical applications."
