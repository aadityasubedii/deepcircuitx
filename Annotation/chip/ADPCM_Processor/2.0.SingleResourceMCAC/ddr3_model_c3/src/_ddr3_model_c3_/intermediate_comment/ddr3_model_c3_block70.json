    "block_comment": "This code block mainly acts as a stimulus for a timing check function, `dq_timing_check`, based on the change of a specific bit of `dq_in`. The implementation involves a sensitivity list that reacts to any change at the 60th bit of `dq_in`. When a change occurs at this bit position, it triggers the function `dq_timing_check` with the argument '60', initiating a timing check at that specific bit."
