    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is meant to perform a timing check on the data queue (dq) bit index 4. Any time there is a change of state (either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) in dq_in[ 4], this block triggers the procedure dq_timing_check(4), which applies timing checks to the specific dq index, ensuring the RTL simulation model's data integrity. The \"always @\" control structure makes this process sensitive to changes at dq_in[ 4], allowing for continuous monitoring."
