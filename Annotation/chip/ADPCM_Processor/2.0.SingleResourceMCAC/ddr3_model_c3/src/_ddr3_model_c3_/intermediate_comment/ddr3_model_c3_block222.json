    "block_comment": "The block performs address matching for a given input within the system's memory. It achieves this by initializing the function `get_index` to zero and then iteratively comparing the input address `addr` to each stored address in the memory. When a match is found, `get_index` returns 1 and the function immediately exits, indicating the presence of the input address in the system memory."
