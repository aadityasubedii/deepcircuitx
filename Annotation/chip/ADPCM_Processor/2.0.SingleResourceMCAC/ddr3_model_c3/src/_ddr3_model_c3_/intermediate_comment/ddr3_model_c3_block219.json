    "block_comment": "The block sets the latency related configuration for both read and write operations in a memory controller. It utilizes CAS latency and additive latency to determine the read and write latencies. Initially, it checks for 'al' (additive latency) being zero - if zero, it sets 'additive_latency' as zero else it subtracts 'al' from 'cas_latency' and assigns it to 'additive_latency'. Afterward, it computes the 'read_latency' by adding 'additive_latency' and 'cas_latency'; similarly 'write_latency' is derived by adding 'cas_write_latency' and 'additive_latency'."
