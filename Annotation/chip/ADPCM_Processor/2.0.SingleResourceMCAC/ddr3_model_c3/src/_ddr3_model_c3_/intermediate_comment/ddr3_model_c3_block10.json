    "block_comment": "This block performs a timing check on DQS signal. The function is achieved by setting up an always block that is sensitive to the positive edge of dqs_in[22], implying that the timing check function, dqs_neg_timing_check, is triggered every time there is a rising edge on the 23rd bit of dqs_in."
