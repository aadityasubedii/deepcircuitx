    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for performing a command address timing check. It does this by using an 'always' block which is sensitive to the second least significant bit (indexed as '1' in a 0-based indexing system) of the 'addr_in' signal. Whenever there's a change in 'addr_in[1]', the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function is called with '8' as a parameter."
