    "block_comment": "The block of code serves as a timing check for the DQ input signal at index 54. Specifically, an `always` clause initiates the `dq_timing_check()` function whenever there is a change detected in `dq_in[54]` - which checks the timing for the 54th DQ input line. The design is implemented efficiently using Verilog's sensitivity list feature, thereby ensuring dynamic tracking and correction of timing issues at runtime."
