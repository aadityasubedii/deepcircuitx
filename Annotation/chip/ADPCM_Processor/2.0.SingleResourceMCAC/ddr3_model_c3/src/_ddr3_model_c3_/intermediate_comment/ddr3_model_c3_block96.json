    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to perform a timing check on the 35th element of the 'dq_in' array [Verilog arrays start from index 0, so index 34 represents the 35th element]. This is achieved through the invocation of the dq_timing_check function when there's a change in the value of 'dq_in[34]'. The sensitizing element 'always@' ensures continuous monitoring and function call whenever change is detected."
