    "block_comment": "The code block is implementing an edge-triggered behavior, where an action takes place on the positive (rising) edge of a signal. This action, specifically `dqs_even_receiver(3)`, is triggered every time the fourth bit (index 3) of the `dqs_even` bus takes a rising edge transition (from low to high). The block acts as a data receiver that's being clocked with the `dqs_even` signal. Note that Verilog index starts from 0."
