    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for running the 'dq_timing_check' function whenever there is a change in the 56th bit of the 'dq_in' data bus. The 'always' block monitors the dq_in[55] signal and responds to any change by invoking the 'dq_timing_check' function with '55' as a parameter. This behavior allows the system to perform dynamic checks on data timing, specifically focusing on the 56th bit, thus aiding in the identification of potential timing problems."
