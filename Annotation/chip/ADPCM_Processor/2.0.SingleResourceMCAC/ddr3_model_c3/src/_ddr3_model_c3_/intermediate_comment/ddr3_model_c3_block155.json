    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for monitoring changes in the 10th bit (indexed at 9) of the input address signal (addr_in). The operation gets triggered whenever there's any change, i.e., a positive or negative edge detected in the 10th bit of addr_in. It then calls the function cmd_addr_timing_check with a constant input of 16. This function might be used to perform some type of timing or synchronisation checks associated with the ongoing command, probably related to the given address' 10th bit."
