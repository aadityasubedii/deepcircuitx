    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for performing a data timing check at the 29th index of the dq_in array. In the Verilog hardware description language, the 'always' keyword is used to continually monitor the value at the 29th index of the dq_in array. Whenever there's a change in the value at the specified index, the 'dq_timing_check' function is invoked with the argument '29', effectively performing a timing check for the 29th index of our data array."
