    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for adding a delay to the signal 'dq'. It's implemented using the 'always' construct in Verilog, which makes the code always listen for any changes to the 'dq' signal. When a change is detected, it delays the signal by the amount specified by 'BUS_DELAY' and assigns the delayed signal to 'dq_in'."
