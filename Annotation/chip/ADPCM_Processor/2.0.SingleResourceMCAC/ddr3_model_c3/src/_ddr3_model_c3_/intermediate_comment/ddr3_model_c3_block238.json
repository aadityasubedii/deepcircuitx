    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a register to hold the value of the 'addr' signal with a delay according to the BUS_DELAY. The use of 'always @(addr)' suggests that this block is sensitive to changes in 'addr'. When the 'addr' signal changes, whatever value 'addr' holds at that time is loaded into 'addr_in' after a delay of 'BUS_DELAY'. The delay simulates the time taken by a real-world bus to respond."
