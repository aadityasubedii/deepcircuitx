    "block_comment": "This particular block of code is mainly employed for performing edge-triggered timing verification. Specifically, the block is looking for a falling (negative) edge on the 11th bit (index 10) of the 'dqs_in' signal. The moment it detects a negative edge on this particular bit, it calls the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function with the argument '10', which likely signifies the bit index for further processing within that subroutine."
