    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for performing command address timing check whenever the 14th bit (0-indexed) of the `addr_in` signal changes. It achieves its function through calling the `cmd_addr_timing_check` function with a static argument of `20`. This function is presumed to facilitate the timing check based on the change in this bit of the input signal."
