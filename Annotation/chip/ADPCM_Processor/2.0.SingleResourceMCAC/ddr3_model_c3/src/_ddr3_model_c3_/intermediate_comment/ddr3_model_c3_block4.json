    "block_comment": "This block of code drives a timing check upon a positive edge detection of the 29th signal in the dqs_in array. Specifically, it uses an always@ block to continuously monitor for a change in the 29th dqs_in signal. When this signal transitions from 0 to 1 (positive edge), it triggers the dqs_neg_timing_check function, passing 28 as an argument."
