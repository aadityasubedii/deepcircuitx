    "block_comment": "This block of code describes the execution of a timing check function whenever there's a change in the 'ras_n_in' input signal in a synchronous digital circuit. Specifically, it uses an 'always' block that is sensitive to 'ras_n_in', meaning that every time 'ras_n_in' changes its value, the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function will be called with '1' as an argument. This function presumably performs a timing check on command address in relation to changes in the 'ras_n_in' signal.\n"
