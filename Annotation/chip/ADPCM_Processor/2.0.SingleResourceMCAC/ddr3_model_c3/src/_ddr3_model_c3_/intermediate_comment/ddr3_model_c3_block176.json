    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a hardware latch circuitry. The function of this design block is to latch the incoming data from the 'dqs_odd' signal at the rising edge of its 16th bit. This is done using an 'always' block which gets triggered whenever there is a positive edge on the 16th bit of the 'dqs_odd' signal array. Once triggered, the function 'dqs_odd_receiver' is called with the argument '15', which corresponds to the 16th bit of the 'dqs_odd' signal array.\n"
