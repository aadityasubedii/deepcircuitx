    "block_comment": "This code block instantiates a always block in Verilog, which is triggered upon any changes to the 'dm_in[0]' signal/bit. Inside the block, it invokes the 'dm_timing_check' procedure with the argument '0', essentially running a timing check on the zeroth bit of 'dm_in'. This way the function monitors the signal 'dm_in[0]' and carries out a timing check whenever this signal changes."
