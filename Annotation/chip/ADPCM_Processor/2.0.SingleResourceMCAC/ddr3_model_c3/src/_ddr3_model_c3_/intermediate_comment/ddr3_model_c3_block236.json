    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog oversees the delay in the transmission of the Data Strobe (DQS) signals. It triggers with every change in DQS or DQS_N signals, reflecting a response to any alterations in the communication between memory controller and memory module. The 16-bit delay is implemented using the `#BUS_DELAY`, which delays the inverse DQS (`dqs_n`) by a binary shift to left by 16 places, and then it's combined with the original DQS signal using bitwise OR operation."
