    "block_comment": "This block of code establishes a sensitivity list for a specific function invocation, `dq_timing_check(17)`. The function is triggered whenever there are changes to the bit indexed by 17 in the `dq_in` array (dq_in[17]). This implementation facilitates the real-time tracking of changes in the specific bit of 'dq_in', ensuring instantaneous execution of the `dq_timing_check(17)` function every time a change is detected."
