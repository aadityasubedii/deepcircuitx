    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for digital circuit timing verification. Specifically, it checks the data memory input on the second bit (index 1, as indexing starts from 0) and tests its timing through the \"dm_timing_check\" function. This always block gets executed whenever there's a change detected on the bit 1 of \"dm_in\". The bit is passed as a parameter to the \"dm_timing_check\" function for detailed evaluation, ensuring proper sequencing and timings."
