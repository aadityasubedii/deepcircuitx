    "block_comment": "This block activates a function named `dqs_neg_timing_check` specifically when a negative edge is detected on the signal `dqs_in[13]`. It achieves this functionality using an `always` block in Verilog that consistently monitors the signal `dqs_in[13]` for a negative transition, at which point it triggers the `dqs_neg_timing_check(13)` function. This is typical in memory interface designs where edge transitions are critical for timing considerations."
