    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a Verilog function named \"ceil\" for the mathematical function ceiling. This function is used to return the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to its input argument. The implementation checks if the input number is greater than its integer part, in which case it returns integer part plus one. Otherwise, it returns the integer part of the number alone. The built-in function $rtoi is used to get the integer part of the input number."
