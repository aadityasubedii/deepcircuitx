    "block_comment": "This block of code is a DQS (Data Strobe) timing verifier module. It is triggered on the rising edge (posedge) of the 17th bit of the input data strobe signal (dqs_in[16]). When a posedge occurs, the dqs_neg_timing_check function is called with the argument 16, which initiates an asynchronous check procedure for the 17th bit, ensuring accurate data transfer and minimizing the timing errors."
