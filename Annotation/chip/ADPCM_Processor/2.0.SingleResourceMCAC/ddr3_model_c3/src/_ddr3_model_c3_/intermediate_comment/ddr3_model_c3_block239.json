    "block_comment": "The block executes a delay assignment operation on signal `ba`. It's designed to emulate physical delays in the transmission of signal `ba` traversing through the hardware bus. The delay value is given by `BUS_DELAY`. Whenever `ba` changes, after a delay of `BUS_DELAY` time units, it updates the `ba_in` with the value of `ba` at the instant the change occurred."
