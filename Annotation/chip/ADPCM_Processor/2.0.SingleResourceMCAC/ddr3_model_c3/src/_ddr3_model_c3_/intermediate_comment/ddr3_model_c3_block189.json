    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to create a DQS (Data Strobe) receiver for DDR (Double Data Rate) memory systems. It listens for and responds to positive edge triggers from `dqs_odd[ 2]`. When a positive edge on `dqs_odd[ 2]` is detected, the `dqs_odd_receiver` function is called with the argument `( 2)`."
