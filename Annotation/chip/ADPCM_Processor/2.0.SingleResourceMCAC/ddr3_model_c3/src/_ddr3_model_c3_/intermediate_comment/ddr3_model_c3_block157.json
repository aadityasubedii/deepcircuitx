    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for the command address timing check. The function of this block is contingent upon the 8th bit (indexed at 7) of the input address 'addr_in'. When this 8th bit of 'addr_in' changes, the `cmd_addr_timing_check(14)` function is triggered to perform the timing check for the command address; specifically, it verifies whether the timing parameters comply with the specifications for the 14th index."
