    "block_comment": "This block is used to implement bus delay in a synchronous system. Verilog's non-blocking assignment operator \"<=\" is used to impose a delay on the \"dm_tdqs\" signal before assigning it to \"dm_in\", representing delay transmission through a bus in a synchronous hardware system. The delay time is dictated by a pre-defined constant \"BUS_DELAY\". This is useful to reproduce the exact system behavior considering signal propagation delays."
