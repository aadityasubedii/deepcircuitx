    "block_comment": "This code block triggers whenever there's a change in the 59th bit of the dq_in data signal. The function called \"dq_timing_check\" gets invoked with the argument as 58, which likely refers to the bit position in the data word upon which the dq_timing_check function is performed. This block is likely utilized for timing validation or error checking based on the specific bit changes in the data.\n"
