    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for transmitting signals on a positive edge. The function is executed whenever there is a positive edge in the signal 'dqs_odd[ 3]'. The implementation is handled by calling the 'dqs_odd_receiver' function with 3 as the parameter, which is invoked each time when there is a positive edge detected on the 'dqs_odd[3]' signal."
