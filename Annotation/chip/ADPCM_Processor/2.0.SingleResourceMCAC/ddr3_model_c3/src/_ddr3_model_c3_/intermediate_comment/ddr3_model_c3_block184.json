    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a piece of logic that is essentially sensitive to the positive edge of signal 'dqs_odd[7]'. The implementation details of the block suggest it's executing function 'dqs_odd_receiver(7)' whenever it observes a transition from low to high (positive edge) on signal 'dqs_odd[7]'."
