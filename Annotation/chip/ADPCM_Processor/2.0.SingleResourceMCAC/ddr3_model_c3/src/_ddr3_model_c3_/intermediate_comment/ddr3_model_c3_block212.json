    "block_comment": "The block in question represents a Verilog task named 'data_task' to perform read and write operations in memory. It makes use of for-loops and conditional statements for checking various conditions such as the validity of data, locks, read/write operations, and timings, and performs actions accordingly. For conditional checks and error displays, it uses Verilog's inbuilt '$display' function. The block manages read and write operations with multiple checks for violations and errors, computes data positions in memory and controls the read/write sequences. For read operations, it fetches data from memory, and for write operations, it writes data to memory while tracking and managing the position of a burst of data. If 'DEBUG' is enabled, the task displays the read/write operation details. Other notable implementation details include managing data output delay, enabling memory pipeline stages for read/write, and adjustment of read/write counters."
