    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for triggering the `dqs_even_receiver()` function every time there is a positive edge in the second (index 1) element of the `dqs_even` array. The implementation is achieved using an \"always\" block that continuously monitors changes on the specified control signal, `dqs_even[1]`, triggering the function whenever a condition (positive edge transition) is met."
