    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a hardware monitoring task. It is designed to trigger a function called `dm_timing_check` whenever there is a change in `dm_in[10]`'s value. This is employed in verification, to ensure proper timing sequences are followed in the digital module. The selected bit of the digital module input (dm_in[10]) is used as the trigger for the timing check function."
