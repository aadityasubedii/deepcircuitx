    "block_comment": "The block is tasked with erasing memory banks. It checks each bank and if the bank's bit is set, the block closes the file associated with that bank and then reopens it. In case the maximum memory is not defined, the block iteratively checks each memory address. If the bank associated with this address is not marked for erasure, it retains the memory and address values, but if the bank is earmarked, it discards the memory and address. At the end, the remaining memory addresses are filled with unknown values, and the memory used is updated to the count of retained values."
