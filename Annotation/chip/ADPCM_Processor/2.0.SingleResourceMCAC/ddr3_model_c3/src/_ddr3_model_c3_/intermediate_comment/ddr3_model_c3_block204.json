    "block_comment": "This block of code executes a function \"dqs_even_receiver\" at every positive edge of a signal \"dqs_even[4]\". The functionality is implemented by the always keyword and 'posedge' which monitors the dqs_even[4] signal and anytime it transitions from a logical low value to a logical high value, the dqs_even_receiver function gets executed with the argument '4'. This approach allows for event-driven execution and is typically used in synchronous designs."
