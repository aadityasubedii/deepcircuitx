    "block_comment": "This block of code triggers a function responsible for performing a negative edge timing check on the 10th DQS (Data Strobe) line. It is achieved using the `always @` command in Verilog, which executes the function `dqs_neg_timing_check( 9)` whenever there is a falling edge (negative edge) detected on `dqs_in[ 9]`."
