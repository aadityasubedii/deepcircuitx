    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for calling the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function at the positive edge of the 27th bit of the dqs_in signal array. The function presumably performs a timing check on the DQS (data strobe) signal. It is implemented as an always block, meaning that the function is called every time there's a transition from a low to a high signal (positive edge) on dqs_in[26]. By placing the function within an always block, it ensures that the timing check is consistently made whenever the specified condition is met, assisting in the real-time evaluation of signal timings."
