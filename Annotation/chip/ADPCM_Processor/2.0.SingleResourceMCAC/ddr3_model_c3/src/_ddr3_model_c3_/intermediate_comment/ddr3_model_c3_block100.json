    "block_comment": "This block of code is invoking a timing check function on the 31st bit of the data queue (dq_in) each time this bit changes. The function dq_timing_check() takes an input parameter of '30', indicating that it's working with the 31st bit of dq_in. This is a common practice in digital design to ensure the proper function of the input dq_in array with respect to specific changing bit, ensuring the design works within required timing constraints."
