    "block_comment": "This block of code executes a function called \"dqs_pos_timing_check\" with the argument \"30\" at the falling edge of signal \"dqs_in[30]\". The trigger condition is specified by 'always @ (negedge dqs_in[30])' construct, making this function sensitive to the negative edge transition of signal \"dqs_in[30]\". This methodology is typically used to synchronize or schedule processes in response to specific signal changes."
