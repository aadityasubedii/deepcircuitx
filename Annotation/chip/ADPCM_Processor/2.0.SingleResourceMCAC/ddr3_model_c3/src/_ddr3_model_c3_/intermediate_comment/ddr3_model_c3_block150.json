    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for initiating an address timing check (cmd_addr_timing_check) whenever the 15th bit (index 14) of the input address (addr_in) changes. It does this by using an 'always' construct to continuously monitor changes to addr_in[14] and then call the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' procedure, passing in a fixed value of 21 as the input parameter."
