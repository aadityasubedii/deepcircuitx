    "block_comment": "This block of code is a procedural block that calls the function `dq_timing_check()` whenever there's a change in the second bit of the `dq_in` signal. The function is implemented in an `always` block, which means it is always waiting and observing for a change in the value of `dq_in[1]`. Once this conditional change is detected, the function `dq_timing_check(1)` is immediately called to perform whatever tasks are defined within it, likely associated with the timing verification of data-queue related operations in this hardware component."
