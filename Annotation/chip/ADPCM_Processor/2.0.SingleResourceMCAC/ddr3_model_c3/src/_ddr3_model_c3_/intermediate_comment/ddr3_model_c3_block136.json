    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for triggering a specific function whenever changes occur in the 'dm_in' 11th index bit. It implements this by using the verily 'always' keyword, which executes the 'dm_timing_check' function at every event where 'dm_in[11]' transitions. This results in continuous monitoring and handling of the concerned digital signal."
