    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for falling edge detection on the signal `dqs_in[22]` . Whenever there is a negative (falling) edge on the the 22nd bit of the `dqs_in` bus, the function `dqs_pos_timing_check()` is called with `22` as its parameter. The transition from high to low state on `dqs_in[22]` effectively triggers the timing check function, maintaining the synchronization of the operations."
