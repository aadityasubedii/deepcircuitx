    "block_comment": "This code block's purpose is to trigger a dynamic timing check whenever the 14th bit (index 13) in the \"dm_in\" data vector changes. This functionality is achieved by using an 'always' block with sensitivity to the 14th bit of the \"dm_in\" data vector. When this specified bit changes state, the 'dm_timing_check' function is invoked with the index value \"13\" passed as an argument."
