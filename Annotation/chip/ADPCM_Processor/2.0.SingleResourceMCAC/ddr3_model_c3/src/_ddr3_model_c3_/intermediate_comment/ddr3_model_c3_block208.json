    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block initiates a DQS receiver circuit for memory interface function at every positive edge of the DQS signal. By constantly detecting positive edge (posedge) transitions on dqs_even[0], it activates the dqs_even_receiver function for index 0, thereby reading and processing data from the memory module."
