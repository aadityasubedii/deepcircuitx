    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for command address timing check with specific conditions. It runs whenever there is a change in the 7th bit (index 6) of the 'addr_in' signal. When this event happens, it triggers the 'cmd_addr_timing_check' function, setting its parameter to '13'. This implementation ensures that specific conditions in the system design are met, providing synchronization and timing control for the address input."
