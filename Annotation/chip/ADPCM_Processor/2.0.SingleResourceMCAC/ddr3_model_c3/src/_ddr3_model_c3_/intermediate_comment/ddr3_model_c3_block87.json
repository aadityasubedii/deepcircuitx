    "block_comment": "This block of code activates a timing check every time there's a change in the 44th bit of the dq_in input signal. It uses the 'always' reserved word to set up a sensitivity list that triggers the dq_timing_check(43) function whenever the specific bit (dq_in[43]) changes. This function is expected to take care of the timing validation for the specified bit, thus monitoring and managing the timing constraints of this part of the system."
