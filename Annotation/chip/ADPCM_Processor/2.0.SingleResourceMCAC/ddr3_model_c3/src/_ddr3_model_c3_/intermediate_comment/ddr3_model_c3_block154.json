    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to launch a predefined function, `cmd_addr_timing_check`, in response to any change in a specific bit of `addr_in`. The bit of interest is the 11th bit (counting starts at 0), as denoted by `addr_in[10]`. The function `cmd_addr_timing_check` is invoked with the argument `17` whenever there's an alteration in the aforementioned bit's value."
