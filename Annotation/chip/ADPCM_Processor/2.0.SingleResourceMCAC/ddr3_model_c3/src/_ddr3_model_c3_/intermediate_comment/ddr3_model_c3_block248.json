    "block_comment": "This code block acts as a delay element for the reset signal in a digital design. It uses a non-blocking assignment to assign the 'rst_n' signal to the 'rst_n_in' after a specified bus delay given by the 'BUS_DELAY' parameter. This delay element might be used to synchronize the reset signal with other signals in the design, or to introduce a known delay for other design requirements. The trigger for the delay operation is the instant when the 'rst_n' signal changes."
