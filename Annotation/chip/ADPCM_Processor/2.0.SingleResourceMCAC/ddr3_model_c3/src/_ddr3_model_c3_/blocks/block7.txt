This block is designed to continuously enact the `dqs_neg_timing_check` function whenever there is a positive edge detected on the 26th bit of the `dqs_in` signal. This is achieved using the `always` keyword followed by `@(posedge dqs_in[25])`, which specifically monitors for a transition from low to high voltage (positive edge) on the 26th bit of the `dqs_in` signal. Whenever such a transition occurs, it triggers the `dqs_neg_timing_check` function for the 26th bit, thus ensuring synchronization and timing checks within the system.
