This code block assigns the tdqs_n wire with a value that is high impedance. The value assigned is a bit vector, 1'bz, replicated DQS_BITS times to match the bit-width of the tdqs_n. It is important to note that 'b' specifies that the number is binary, 'z' indicates high impedance state in Verilog, and DQS_BITS is presumably a parameter specifying the width of data quick switch (DQS) line in the application. Hence, this line is essentially putting the DQS line into a high impedance state, which helps in bidirectional data transfer scenarios where it is desirable to disconnect the line when it is not in use.
