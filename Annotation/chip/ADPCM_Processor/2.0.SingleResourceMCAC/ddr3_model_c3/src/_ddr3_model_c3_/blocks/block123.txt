Comment: 
The given block is executing a subroutine `dq_timing_check` whenever there's a change in the 8th bit (index 7) of the input signal `dq_in`. This subroutine, `dq_timing_check( 7)`, is likely to perform some form of timing verification or calculation for the specified bit of `dq_in`. This behavior is achieved through the use of always block in Verilog which gets triggered every time there is a change in the mentioned signal, in this case `dq_in[ 7]`.
