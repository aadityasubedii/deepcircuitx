The block of code triggers a timing check on a negative edge of signal dqs_in[21]. The operation occurs whenever there's a positive transition (posedge) in the 21st index of the input signal dqs_in. This functionality is achieved using an always keyword to make the timing check continuous, which is invoked by calling the dqs_neg_timing_check function with the argument 21.
