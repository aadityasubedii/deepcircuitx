Comment: 
The block of code performs a timing check operation on the sixteenth bit of the data memory input, `dm_in`. The `always` keyword in Verilog signifies a procedural block that triggers whenever there's a change in the provided input signal, which in this case, is the sixteenth bit (indexed as 15) of `dm_in`. The triggered operation is a user-defined function, `dm_timing_check`, that presumably checks the timing properties or constraints of the sixteenth bit of the `dm_in` signal.
