This block of code is utilized to check the timing of Data Strobe (DQS) signal. The procedure gets activated at the rising edge (`posedge`) of the 16th DQS signal (`dqs_in[15]`). When there is a positive edge detected in `dqs_in[15]`, it initiates the `dqs_pos_timing_check(15)` function to ensure correct timing and synchronization.
