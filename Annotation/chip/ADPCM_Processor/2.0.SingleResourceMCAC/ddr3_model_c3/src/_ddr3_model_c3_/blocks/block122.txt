This module is responsible for ensuring the correct timing of the data inputs. It achieves its goal by continuously monitoring the ninth bit (indexed at 8) of the dq_in data inputs. If there's any change detected in the ninth bit, the dq_timing_check function with parametric input '8' will be activated in response to the detected change. This is crucial to preserving the integrity of the data transmission, ensuring timely responses to any input modifications.
