Comment: 
This Verilog RTL block is responsible for simulating a delay in the forwarding of the clock signal 'ck_n' to 'ck_n_in'. The delay is implemented using a non-blocking assignment which ensures a specific delay (BUS_DELAY) during assignments. In response to a change in 'ck_n', 'ck_n_in' receives the new value of 'ck_n' after a duration of 'BUS_DELAY'.
