This block of code implements a timing check on a rising edge of DQS signal for data capturing. The code employs an 'always' construct with a posedge sensitive signal 'dqs_in[13]', which means whenever there is a positive edge detected on the 'dqs_in[13]' signal, it will execute a call to the function 'dqs_pos_timing_check' providing '13' as argument, possibly for identifying a particular bit lane or channel.
