This block of code performs a timing check on the 22nd bit of the `dq_in` signal. The function `dq_timing_check` is called whenever there is a change in the 22nd bit of the `dq_in` signal, thereby ensuring that the behavior of this specific bit of the signal `dq_in` is correct and meets the desired timing requirements.
