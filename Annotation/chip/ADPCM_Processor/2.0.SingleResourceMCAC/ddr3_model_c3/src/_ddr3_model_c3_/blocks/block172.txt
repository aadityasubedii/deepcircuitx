Comment: 
The task block named `cmd_addr_timing_check` in Verilog checks for violations of timing parameters in command and address signal sequences. The implementation uses conditionals to check three different types of violations: `tIH` (input high time) and `tIPW` (Input pulse width), where `tIH` is further checked when `i==0` and when `i>0` with `cs_n_in==0`. Errors are displayed with timestamps and violating parameters when a violation is detected. The `tm_cmd_addr[i]` register is finally updated with the current simulation time.
