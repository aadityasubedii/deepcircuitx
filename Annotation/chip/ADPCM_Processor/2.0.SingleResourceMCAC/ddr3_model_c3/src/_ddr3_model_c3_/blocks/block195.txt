This block of code implements a clocked process which gets triggered on a positive edge of 'dqs_even[13]' signal. The functionality is to call the 'dqs_even_receiver' method with the signal index '13', only when there is a positive edge detection on the dqs_even[13] signal. The exact operation of 'dqs_even_receiver' method would be defined somewhere else in the code. The number '13' suggests that 'dqs_even' is a bit vector and index '13' is used specifically for some functionality.
