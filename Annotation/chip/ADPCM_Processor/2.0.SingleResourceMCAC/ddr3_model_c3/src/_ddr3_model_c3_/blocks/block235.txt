Comment: 
This block is responsible for introducing a delay to the On-Die Termination (odt) signal. This is achieved using a non-blocking assignment where the delay is denoted by the `#BUS_DELAY` constant. The delayed signal is then assigned to `odt_in`. This occurs whenever there is a change in the `odt` signal due to the `always @` event control.
