This block of Verilog code represents a memory write function. It takes in bank, row, column, and data inputs to write data into memory. If the "MAX_MEM" flag is defined, the memory address is calculated based on the row and column inputs, and the data is written to the corresponding file in the memory array. If "MAX_MEM" is not defined, the address is calculated using the bank, row, column inputs divided by the maximum burst length (BL_MAX). It attempts to write to an existing memory address if possible; if not, and if the memory is not full, it writes to a new memory address and increments the memory count. If the memory is full, it logs an error message and stops execution if the "STOP_ON_ERROR" flag is set.
