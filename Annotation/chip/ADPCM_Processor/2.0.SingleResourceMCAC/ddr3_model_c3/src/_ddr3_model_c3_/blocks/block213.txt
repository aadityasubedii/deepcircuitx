This block of code defines a task called `cmd_task` that processes commands in a DDR3 SDRAM controller. Here's a summary of its function and implementation:

[Function of the block]. The cmd_task processes various DDR3 SDRAM commands such as LOAD MODE, REFRESH, PRECHARGE, ACTIVATE, WRITE, READ, and ZQ calibration. It checks for timing violations, updates internal states, and performs the necessary operations based on the received command.

[Implementation details of the block]. The task uses a case statement to handle different commands. It performs extensive timing checks, updates internal counters and flags, and manages the SDRAM's state machine. The task handles initialization sequence, power-down modes, self-refresh, and various SDRAM operations. It also includes debug messages and error reporting for timing violations and illegal operations. The implementation uses multiple internal registers and pipelines to track timing, bank states, and ongoing operations.
