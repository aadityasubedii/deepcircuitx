This block of code performs a timing check function each time there's a negative edge transition on the 22nd bit (index 21) of the dqs_in signal. It accomplishes this by calling the dqs_pos_timing_check function with argument 21 on each negative edge transition, ensuring correct timing at this specific signal index.
