Comment: 
This block of code creates a time-delayed version of the incoming clock signal. The delay is determined by the value of `BUS_DELAY`. This function is achieved by using a non-blocking assignment (`<=`) within an always block that is triggered on every change (`@`) of the signal `ck`. The signal `ck` is delayed by `BUS_DELAY`, creating the new signal `ck_in`. This block of code effectively models the physical realities involved in electronic signal propagation, which can cause delays in signal reception.
