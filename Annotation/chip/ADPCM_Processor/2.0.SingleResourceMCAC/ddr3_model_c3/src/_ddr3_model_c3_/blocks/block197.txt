Comment: 
This block of code is a part of a clocked digital system. It activates the function `dqs_even_receiver` on the event of a rising edge on the signal `dqs_even[11]`. Running at every positive-edge transition of `dqs_even[11]`, it passes '11' as the parameter to `dqs_even_receiver` function for processing thus achieving synchronous signal processing.
