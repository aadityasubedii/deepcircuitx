This block of code initiates a timing check on bit 37 of the input data queue (dq_in). Implemented using the always block, it ensures this timing check is performed each time there is a change in state of the 37th bit in dq_in. The operation is performed via the function dq_timing_check utilizing '37' as its argument.
