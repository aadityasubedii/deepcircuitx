Comment: 
The block is used for triggering an operation when there's a positive edge (i.e., transition from 0 to 1) on the 15th bit of the dqs_odd signal. The operation it triggers is a call to the dqs_odd_receiver function with 14 as an argument. This is likely a part of a DDR interfacing code where the DQS lines are used to control data sampling and/or transmission. The specific function's operation details might depend on other parts of this code.
