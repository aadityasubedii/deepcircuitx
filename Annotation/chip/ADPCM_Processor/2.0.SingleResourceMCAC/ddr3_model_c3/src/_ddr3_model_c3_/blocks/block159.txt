Comment: 
This block of code is a procedural block that monitors changes specifically in the 6th bit of the 'addr_in' bus [addr_in[5]]. It invokes the `cmd_addr_timing_check` function with an input of '12' whenever there is a change (either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transitioning) in addr_in[5]. Consequently, this portion of the code is for the synchronization of command addresses and checks the timing for it based on some internal conditions defined in `cmd_addr_timing_check(12)`.
