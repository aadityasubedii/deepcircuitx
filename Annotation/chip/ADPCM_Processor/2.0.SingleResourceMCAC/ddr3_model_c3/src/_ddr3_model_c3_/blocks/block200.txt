Comment: 
This block of code is used to trigger a DQS (Data Strobe) signal receiver at the rising edge of the `dqs_even[ 8]` signal. The `always @ (posedge dqs_even[ 8])` statement in Verilog establishes the edge-triggered behaviour, where the code within the block will only execute on the rising edge of the specified signal (in this case `dqs_even[ 8]`). The function `dqs_even_receiver( 8)` is then called each time this event takes place.
