The block of code launches the procedure `dqs_odd_receiver` whenever there is a positive edge in the 13th element of the `dqs_odd` array. To achieve this, the `always` block monitors the particular element of the `dqs_odd` array for a transition from 0 to 1 (positive edge), and when it occurs, it executes the procedure `dqs_odd_receiver` with the specific index as the argument.
