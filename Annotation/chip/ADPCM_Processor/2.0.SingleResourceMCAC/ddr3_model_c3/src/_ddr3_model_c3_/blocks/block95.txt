Comment: 
This block of Verilog code creates a hardware trigger that activates whenever the 36th bit (taking indices from 0) of the `dq_in` array changes state. Specifically, it constantly monitors the 36th bit of the `dq_in` array and calls the `dq_timing_check` function with an argument of `35` whenever there is a change. The `dq_timing_check` function presumably handles some form of timing analysis or corrective action in response to timing events or anomalies in the `dq_in` array.
