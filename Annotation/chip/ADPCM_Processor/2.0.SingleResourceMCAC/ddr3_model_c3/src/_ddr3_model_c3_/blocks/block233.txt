Comment: 
This block is responsible for generating an edge-triggered clock signal. It utilizes a positive-edge triggered `always` block to ensure that the `diff_ck` signal is updated only on the rising edge of the `ck_n_in` clock input, while the inversion (`~`) of `ck_n_in` results in a digital clock signal that flips its state on every rising edge of the `ck_n_in` input clock signal.
