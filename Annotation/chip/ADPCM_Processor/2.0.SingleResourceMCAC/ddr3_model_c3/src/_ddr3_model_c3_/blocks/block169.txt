This block of code implements a function that runs the `cmd_addr_timing_check` method whenever there's a change in `cas_n_in`. It does so using an "always" block which gets triggered every time the variable `cas_n_in` changes its value. The `cmd_addr_timing_check` method is invoked with a hardcoded argument of 2.
