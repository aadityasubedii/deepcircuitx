This block controls the data receiver operation triggered by the positive edge of the DQS (data strobe) signal for odd data bits. Specifically, it calls the dqs_odd_receiver function when it detects a positive edge in the dqs_odd[0] signal, which results in data reception for the first odd bit being carried out. The implementation relies on an asynchronous high-level trigger, which means that the receiver function operates whenever there is a change from low to high in the signal value.
