The block monitors for negative edge transitions of the 4th element of the 'dqs_in' array. When a negative edge is detected, it triggers the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function with 3 as the input parameter. The design is achieved through an 'always' block in Verilog which is executed whenever there's a change in the mentioned condition, here it's a falling edge of 'dqs_in' bus signified by 'negedge'.
