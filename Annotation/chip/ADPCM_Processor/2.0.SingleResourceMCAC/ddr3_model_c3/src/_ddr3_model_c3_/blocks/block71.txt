Comment: 
This block of code triggers a timing check function for the 60th bit of the `dq_in` data input vector in response to any change in that bit. The `always@` statement in Verilog indicates that this block is set to activate whenever there is a change (`@`) in `dq_in[59]`. The function `dq_timing_check(59)` is invoked to conduct the timing check on that particular bit. It allows the system to closely monitor and manage timing issues related to this bit in real-time.
