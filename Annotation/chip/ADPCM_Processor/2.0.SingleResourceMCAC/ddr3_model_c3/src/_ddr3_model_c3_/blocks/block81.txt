This block consists of a single, event-driven procedural statement which checks the timing of the 50th bit of the `dq_in` input array, an operation performed by the `dq_timing_check` function. It is triggered whenever there's a change detected on the 50th bit (index 49) of the `dq_in` array, effectively ensuring real-time monitoring and evaluation of changes to that specific bit position within the array. The function `dq_timing_check` is responsible for the testing procedure.
