Comment: 
This Verilog block is essentially a timing checker for the clock enable signal (`cke_in`). It checks if the signal respects a specific timing constraint known as the tIH (input high time) and tIPW (input pulse width). It will display an error message if the timing of `cke_in` does not obey those restrictions. The implementation uses system tasks for checking the current simulation time (`$time`), and it calculates the tIH and tIPW timing based on predefined constraints `TIH` and `TIPW`. It also triggers a display if a reset signal (`rst_n_in`) is enabled, stating an error message if the timing checks fail, otherwise updating `tm_cke` with the current time.
