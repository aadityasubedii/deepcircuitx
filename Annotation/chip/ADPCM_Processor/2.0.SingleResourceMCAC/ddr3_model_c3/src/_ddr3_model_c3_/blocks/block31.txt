This block of code triggers a timing check on a negative edge of the second data quantum synchronizer (dqs) signal. The `always` command in Verilog ensures that this operation is performed each time there is a falling edge on the `dqs_in[1]` signal. The effect is to call the `dqs_neg_timing_check` function with an argument of 1 whenever this condition is met.
