Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for the function of driving a timing check for specific data memory (dm) input (dm_in). It employs an always block construct to monitor changes to the 15th bit of the data memory input (dm_in[14]), on every change of which it triggers the procedure call to dm_timing_check with the argument 14.
