The function of this block is to continually monitor the signal at index 51 of the dq_in array and trigger a timing check whenever that signal changes. The block achieves this by use of the 'always' keyword, which operates in an infinite loop, and event control triggered by any changes to dq_in[51]. When a signal change does occur, the `dq_timing_check` function is called with the argument 51, checking timing for this specific index in the dq_in array.
