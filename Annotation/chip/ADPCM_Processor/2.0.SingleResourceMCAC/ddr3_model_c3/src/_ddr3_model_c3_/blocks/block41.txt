Comment: 
This block of code is essentially used for conducting timing check for a Data Strobe (DQS) signal at a negedge or the falling edge of the 25th bit. In the Verilog RTL code, `always @ (negedge dqs_in[24])` initiates a procedure that gets triggered on the negative edge of the 25th bit of the DQS signal. The `dqs_pos_timing_check(24)` is the function called within this procedure to perform the actual timing check.
