This block of code performs a timing check function. Specifically, it invokes the 'dqs_neg_timing_check' function whenever there's a negative edge detected in the 8th bit (index: 7) of the dqs_in array/buffer. The 'always@' keyword facilitates reactive triggering in response to specified events, allowing the system to efficiently monitor and respond to alterations in input conditions in real-time.
