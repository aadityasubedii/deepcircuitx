Comment: 
This block serves as a data receiver for the 14th Odd Data Strobe (DQS) signal. The `always` keyword indicates that this block is always triggered on the positive edge of the DQS signal, indicating that data transmission occurs only when the DQS signal switches from a low state to a high state. Specifically, upon each positive edge of the 14th bit of the `dqs_odd` array (sync signal for memory interface), a function `dqs_odd_receiver()` is called with the index 13. This effectively means that the code is handling the reception of data for the 14th line in a memory interface.
