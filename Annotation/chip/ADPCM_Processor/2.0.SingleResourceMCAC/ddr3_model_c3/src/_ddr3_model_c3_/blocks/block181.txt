This block of code is responsible for performing an edge-triggered update on a receiver function. Specifically, the triggering happens at the positive edge of the eleventh element in the `dqs_odd` array. During each positive edge of `dqs_odd[10]`, the receiver function `dqs_odd_receiver` with an argument of 10 is called to process or handle the new data.
