The given block code is used to model bus delay in a Verilog design. It functions by delaying the rising and falling edges of input 'ras_n' by a pre-defined time period '#BUS_DELAY' and directs the output to 'ras_n_in'. The implementation utilizes the non-blocking assignment ('<=') which introduces a delay specified by '#BUS_DELAY'. This is often used in synchronous circuits to represent wire delays or timing delays.
