This block of code invokes the function `dqs_pos_timing_check` on the falling edge of the 21st element of the `dqs_in` signal array. The `always` keyword indicates that the function is continuously checked, specifically whenever there is a negative (downwards) transition (represented by `negedge`) on `dqs_in[20]`. This is used for implementing the functionality of dynamic data-strobe (DQS) timing checks in memory interfaces like DDR to ensure concurrency of data transfer.
