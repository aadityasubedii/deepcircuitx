Comment: 
This block of code primarily functions as a warning and error display system under specific conditions related to the reset signal (`rst_n_in`) and clock enable (`cke_in`). When a positive edge event happens on `rst_n_in` signal, the block checks several conditions. For instance, it raises a warning if the condition `($time < 200000000 && check_strict_timing)` holds, indicating that 200 microseconds haven't passed before deactivating `rst_n_in`. It also checks for errors like `cke_in` being active while `rst_n_in` going inactive, and when `cke_in` stays inactive for less than 10 nanoseconds prior to `rst_n_in`. Furthermore, the block handles a conditionally compiled part that sets `memory_used` to 0, if `MAX_MEM` is not defined.
