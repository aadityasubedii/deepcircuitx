This block of code is used for performing a timing check for a positive edge DQS transition at position 9 in the `dqs_in` input array. The implementation is done through the procedure `dqs_pos_timing_check` which has the index 9 passed as an argument whenever a positive edge is detected on the DQS (Data Strobe) signal at position 9 of `dqs_in`.
