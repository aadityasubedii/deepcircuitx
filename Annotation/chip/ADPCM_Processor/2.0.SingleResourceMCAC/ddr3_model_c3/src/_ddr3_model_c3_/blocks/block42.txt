Comment: 
This block of code contains a trigger for the procedural block `dqs_pos_timing_check` on every negative edge (falling edge) of the `dqs_in[23]` signal. The `@dqs_in[23]` portion specifies the trigger condition or sensitivity list of the block. The implementation is a one-line function/procedure call `dqs_pos_timing_check(23)` which suggests it's executing a timing check operation on a specific chip select line, presumably for data quality or timing validation purposes.
