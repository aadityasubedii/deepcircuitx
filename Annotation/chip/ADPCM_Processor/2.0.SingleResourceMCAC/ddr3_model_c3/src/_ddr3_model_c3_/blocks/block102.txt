This block triggers the function `dq_timing_check (28)` whenever there's a change in the 29th bit of `dq_in` input array. The use of `always @` construct means the block is sensitive to the changes on `dq_in[28]` and will call the `dq_timing_check` function as soon as this specific bit changes. This way, the implementation enables real-time monitoring and timing check for the 29th bit of the `dq_in` input.
