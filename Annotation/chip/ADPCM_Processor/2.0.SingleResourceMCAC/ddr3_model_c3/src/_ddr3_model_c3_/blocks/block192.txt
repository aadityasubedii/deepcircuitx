This block is a task function designed to handle odd receivers in a memory Data Strobe (DQS). It creates an adjustable mask for handling incoming data and integrates it with data masking. The task takes a 4-bit input `i`, and creates a 64-bit bitmask depending on the number of data lines per DQS (`DQ_PER_DQS`). If the DQS is odd (verified by `dqs_odd[i]`), it checks whether the DQS is enabled. If enabled, it suppresses the data mask `dm_in_neg[i]` to avoid masking, else it assigns the data mask `dm_in_neg[i]` to the source `dm_in[i]`. Finally, a new DQ input value is calculated by logically combining current DQ input `dq_in`, bitmask `bit_mask`, and the negation of previous DQ input `dq_in_neg`, thereby ensuring the correct data line is updated.
