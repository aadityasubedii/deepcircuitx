This block of Verilog code declares three parameters which are used to represent different constant values in memory banking systems. It uses 2-bit binary notation to assign unique values to each parameter. The 'SAME_BANK' parameter corresponds to situations where the memory request is from the same memory bank, 'DIFF_BANK' to calls from different memory banks, and 'DIFF_GROUP' when calls belong to different memory groups. It simplifies the code by enhancing readability and providing a means to reference these specific banking conditions throughout the rest of the code.
