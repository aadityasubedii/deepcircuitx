Module-level comment: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM device, implementing timing checks, data transfer, and internal state management. It models read/write operations, refresh cycles, and power-down modes. The module uses task-based implementations for command decoding, data handling, and timing verification. It maintains internal registers for bank states, pipelines for command execution, and performs extensive timing checks to ensure DDR3 SDRAM protocol compliance. The module also supports features like on-die termination, write leveling, and multipurpose register operations.
