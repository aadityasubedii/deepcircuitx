Module-level comment: This 'generic_sram_line_en' Verilog module acts as a synchronous SRAM with enable signals. The module includes control inputs (reset, clk, write_enable), data and address inputs, and scan testing inputs and outputs. Internal signals manage memory storage and reset operation. The module's functionality includes reading from and writing into memory locations, specified by i_address, synchronized with the clk signal. The memory is initialized to either 0 or 1 based on the INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO parameter during reset. Testing functionalities are also supported through scan-related ports.
