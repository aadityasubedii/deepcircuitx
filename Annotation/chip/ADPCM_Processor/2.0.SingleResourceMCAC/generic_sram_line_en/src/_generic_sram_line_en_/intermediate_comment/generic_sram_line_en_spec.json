Another internal signal, 'i', is used as a counter in the reset operation initializing all memory slots to zero or one depending on the parameter value of INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO during this operation. \n\nThe code is divided mainly into blocks which handle the reset sequence, the read operation, and the write operation. The reset sequence reinstates the memory to initial values based on the 'reset' signal.

It takes a clock signal (clk), a reset signal, a write enable signal (i_write_enable), a data signal to write (i_write_data), and an address signal (i_address).

Independently if the write enable is active or not, the data stored at the provided address is read and output (o_read_data). If a reset signal is detected, the existing data in the memory is either set to 0 (or 1 if INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO parameter is set to 2) based on the INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO flag.
