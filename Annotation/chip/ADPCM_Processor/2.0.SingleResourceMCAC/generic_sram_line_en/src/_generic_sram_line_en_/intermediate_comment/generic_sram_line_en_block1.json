    "block_comment": "This is a Verilog RAM controller module. It is triggered on each rising clock edge or a rising edge of a reset signal. If a reset is detected, it checks `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO` and if it is true, it initializes the `o_read_data` and all `mem` entries to zero. Otherwise, on every clock edge, it updates `o_read_data` from `mem` at `i_address`, replacing it with zero if `i_write_enable` is high. If `i_write_enable` is active, it takes `i_write_data` as input and stores it at the memory location indicated by `i_address`."
