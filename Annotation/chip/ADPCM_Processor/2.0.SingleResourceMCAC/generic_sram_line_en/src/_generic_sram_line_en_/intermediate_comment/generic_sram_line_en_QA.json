It takes a clock signal (clk), a reset signal, a write enable signal (i_write_enable), a data signal to write (i_write_data), and an address signal (i_address). On a positive clock edge, if the write enable is active, the input data will be written to the memory array (mem) at the specified address. Independently if the write enable is active or not, the data stored at the provided address is read and output (o_read_data). If a reset signal is detected, the existing data in the memory is either set to 0 (or 1 if INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO parameter is set to 2) based on the INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO flag. The module also includes some scan test related inputs and outputs, which are likely used for testing and verification purposes."

The ports related to scan operation are likely used for test and fault finding operations related to hardware design."
