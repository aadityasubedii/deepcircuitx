    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule Specification: This module is a testbench aimed at testing the \"generic_sram_line_en\" top module of a Verilog design. The 'test' module uses system clock signals, reset signals, scan inputs, a scan_enable signal, and a test_mode signal as its inputs. Furthermore, it employs scan outputs that serve as its output signals. The testbench assigns initial values to all these signals for setting up the system to an initial state. Specifically, for clock and reset signals, it is essential for initializing the system's timing and setting the system in its initial state, respectively. On the other hand, the inputs for the scan chain (scan_in0 to scan_in4) and the corresponding scanner enable signal provide an additional internal state of the circuit for testing. Test_mode input is used to switch the system between test and normal operations.\n\nNow, the scan chain outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) carry the captured internal state of the circuit for debugging and testing. This testbench also includes Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotation for timing information, improving the simulation's accuracy. However, it's conditionally compiled based on the SDFSCAN definition. \n\nThe module is primarily split into two main sections: the \"generic_sram_line_en\" top module and an 'initial' block. The initial block determines the initial state of the registers and gives them a sequence of values, setting the defined module's state as per requirements. Finally, the simulation is completed using the $finish command. Thus, the 'test' module is a means of setting initial conditions and running a simulation on the Verilog design module \"generic_sram_line_en\".",
