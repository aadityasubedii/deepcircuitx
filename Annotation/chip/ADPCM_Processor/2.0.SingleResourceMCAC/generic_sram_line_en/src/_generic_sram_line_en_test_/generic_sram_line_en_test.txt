Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the 'generic_sram_line_en' Verilog module. It initializes clock, reset, scan inputs, scan_enable, and test_mode signals, and connects scan outputs to the target module. The 'initial' block sets the initial state of the registers, and the SDF annotation, if conditionally compiled, incorporates timing information. The module concludes simulations with the $finish command.
