    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module is designed as a testbench for the 'generic_sram_line_en' module. It includes input ports for clocking, resetting, scan testing, and test mode selection, and output ports to observe scan test response. Internally, it uses the same signals for setup and testing. The code begins with instantiating the 'generic_sram_line_en' module tied to the defined ports, followed by an initial block preparing the simulation environment, initializing the signals, and scheduling the simulation finish. This allows verifying module operation under different conditions."
