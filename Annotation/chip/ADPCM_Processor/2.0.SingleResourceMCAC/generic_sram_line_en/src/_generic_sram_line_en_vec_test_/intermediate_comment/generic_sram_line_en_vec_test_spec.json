    "spec": "Module name: test\n\nModule specification: The 'test' module is primarily designed as a testbench, providing an environment for checking the functionality of another module, 'generic_sram_line_en'. This testbench is equipped with numerous input ports, including 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'. Here, 'clk' is the clock signal controlling timing, 'reset' is for initializing the system, 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' are used for scan testing, 'scan_enable' enables the scanning function, and 'test_mode' selects the testing configurations. The output ports 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' are used to observe the output during the scan test. Internally, the same signals function for scan testing, clocking, resetting, and test mode control. Understanding their operation allows us to analyze the system's response to various conditions. The coding blocks in this testbench start with an instantiation of the 'generic_sram_line_en' module, connecting the defined input and output ports. Additionally, an initial block configures the simulation environment, denotes the timescale, possibly annotates the SDF for accurate timing, initializes the signals and terminates the simulation using the $finish system task. Overall, the 'test' module is a versatile tool for simulating and observing the response of 'generic_sram_line_en' under various conditions.",
