Module name: enc. 

Module specification: 
The module 'enc' is a part of a bigger system which seems to deal with encoding and decoding operations, as the undef macros ENC and DEC suggests. However, the segment of the code provided solely focuses on the module 'enc'. Its primary responsibility includes initializing two 2-bit registers 'A' and 'B' with the preset values provided by macros `A and `B. After initializing, it displays the bit values of the registers 'A' and 'B'. The entire definition of the module lies between the keywords 'module' at the beginning and 'endmodule' at the end. There are no explicit input or output ports defined within this module, indicating it's a standalone module or a significant portion of the remaining code is unavailable. The internal signals used within the module are the registers 'A' and 'B'. These serve the purpose of storing and reflecting the initial values of macros `A and `B, essential for further processing or computations within the module. Additionally, the module includes an 'initial' block where the initialization and display operations are performed. It should be noted that the `include statement at the top suggests inclusion of 'global_defines.vh' file which might contain additional definitions and functionalities relevant to this module, and these definitions may significantly influence the overall functionality of 'enc'.
