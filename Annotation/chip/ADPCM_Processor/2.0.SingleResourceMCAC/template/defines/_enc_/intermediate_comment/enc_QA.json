The main functionality of this module, viewing from the given code snippet, is to initiate two 2-bit registers A and B with preset values given by macros `A and `B. It then displays the values of A and B. However, the complete functionality cannot be accurately described without the rest of the code. The `include statement suggests that there are more definitions in 'global_defines.vh' which might be utilized in this module. Additional functionalities might be derived from these definitions."
