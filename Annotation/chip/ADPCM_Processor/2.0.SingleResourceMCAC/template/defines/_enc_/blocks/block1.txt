This block serves as initialization in Verilog RTL code. It sets the initial values for A and B with predefined macros, `A and `B respectively, and then it uses the $display system task to display the initial values of A and B. The explicit assignment of values is executed in the begin-end structure, which ensures all statements within it are executed sequentially, reflecting the detailed design sequence.
