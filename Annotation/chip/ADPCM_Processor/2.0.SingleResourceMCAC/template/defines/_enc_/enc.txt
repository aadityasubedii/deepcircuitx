Module-level comment: 
// 'enc' is a standalone Verilog module utilizing macros from 'global_defines.vh'. It initializes two 2-bit registers 'A' and 'B' with the preset values of macros `A and `B, respectively. There are no explicit input or output ports; the values of 'A' and 'B' are displayed via $display system task. Further processing or computations related to these registers occur within the module, though more information is likely contained in the broader code or 'global_defines.vh'.
