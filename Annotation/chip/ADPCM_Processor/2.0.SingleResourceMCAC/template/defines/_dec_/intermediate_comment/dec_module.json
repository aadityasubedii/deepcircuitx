    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'dec' module initializes and displays two 2-bit internal registers 'A' and 'B' from global constants `A and `B. No other operations are performed on these registers, and the module doesn't have explicit input-output ports. The functionality is achieved via an 'initial' block, which assigns global constant values to the registers and 'display' function in Verilog for output. This module stands as a standalone unit with no clear integration with other hardware components."
