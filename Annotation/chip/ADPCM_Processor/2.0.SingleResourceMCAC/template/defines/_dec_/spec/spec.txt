Module name: dec. 

Module specification: The module "dec" is a simple Verilog design with a sole purpose of initializing two 2-bit registers A and B, utilizing the globally defined constants `A and `B. The operation is performed as soon as the module initiates. The values assigned to these registers are based on the globally defined values which are included in the beginning using the `include preprocessor directive. The names of the registers and globally defined constants match, but in terms of functionality, they are not tied together. Register values A and B are merely displayed using the $display function in the sequence of initialization. The module does not have any explicit inputs or outputs, meaning it does not interact with other entities via ports. However, it does have internal signals named A and B, serving as buffers to store and display the initial values assigned to them from global constants. In essence, registers A and B serve to store initial values and display them but have no further use or functionality beyond that in the given code. This module structure consists of an initial block defining and initializing internal signals and a display function. The functional contribution of this module to a broader hardware design seems unclear and possibly incomplete from the given Verilog code due to the lack of ports and operations on defined registers.
