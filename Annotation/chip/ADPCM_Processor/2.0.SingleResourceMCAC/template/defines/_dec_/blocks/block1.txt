This block of code initializes register values and prints them out. Initially, register A is assigned a value defined by the macro `A and register B is assigned a value defined by the macro `B. After assignment, the values of these registers are displayed in the console, in decimal format. The `$display` system task is used to print the message in the string format, displaying the values of A and B.
