Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog is being used for debugging and verification of the encoders (`ENC`) and the decoders (`DEC`). The code will print the values of 'A' and 'B' signals for both the encoder and the decoder at the time of simulation. This helps in observing their values at the start of simulation runs, which is essential for debugging and ensuring correctness of logic. These values may change subsequently as the simulation progresses.
