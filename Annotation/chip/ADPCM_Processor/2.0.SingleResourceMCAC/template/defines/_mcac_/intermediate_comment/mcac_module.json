    "module": "Module-level comment: // 'mcac' serves as a monitor for 'enc' and 'dec' modules, lacking defined input and output ports and internal signals. On simulation begin, it displays values of A and B attributes of 'enc' and 'dec' via an initial block. However, this module doesn't alter or process any data, suggesting its function may be for debug or monitoring purposes only.\n"
