Module name: mcac. Module specification: The 'mcac' module serves as a platform to initiate interaction with two other modules named 'enc' (ENC) and 'dec' (DEC). The purpose of these interactions is not explicitly described in the given code snippet but the defined initial block suggests that the 'mcac' module is being used to primarily monitor and display the values of A and B attributes for both the 'ENC' and 'DEC' modules. The method of transfer or change in these attributes values is not defined. Interestingly, there are no explicitly defined input or output ports in the 'mcac' module suggesting that its purpose might be purely for debugging or monitoring other modules rather than processing data or signals. Additionally, there are no explicit internal signals utilized within the 'mcac' module as per the given code. The code can be divided into three sections - the module declaration, the instantiation of 'ENC' and 'DEC' modules, and the initial block. The initial block is responsible for executing a code sequence at the beginning of the simulation and display specific attribute values of the instantiated modules. Yet, more detailed information about the 'ENC' and 'DEC' modules would provide a clearer picture of the overall functions of the 'mcac' module.
