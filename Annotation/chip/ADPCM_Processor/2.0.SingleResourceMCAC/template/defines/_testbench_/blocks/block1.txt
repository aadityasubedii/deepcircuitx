This block of Verilog RTL code governs the initialization of certain constants and settings, specifically redefining and calling encoder, decoder functionalities while also displaying the corresponding test messages. The block first undefines 'ENC' and 'DEC' if they are previously defined. It then defines and includes 'ENC', 'DEC' in the "global_defines.vh" and prints their respective test messages with associated 'A', 'B' value. Following this, it undefined 'ENC' and 'DEC' again, includes "global_defines.vh" and displays the message for 'undef'. The repeated definition and undefinition ensure that the correct settings are implemented at the initialization.
