Module name: test. 

Module specification: The "test" module doesn't incorporate hardware-related functionalities. It operates as a test bench primarily utilized for diagnosing the macros 'ENC' and 'DEC' in combination with the variables `A and `B. It adopts macros (`define, `include, and `undef directives) to manage the utilization and reference of the variables from an external header file named "global_defines.vh". The module is devoid of any input or output ports, inferring that it functions independently to either generate required data internally or doesn't necessitate any input data. Its output isn't port signals but printouts or displays. 

Internally, it uses the placeholders `A and `B, which are not actual internal signals but rather macro substitutions obtained from "global_defines.vh". These are postulated to be data or constant variables which are defined in "global_defines.vh". The macros `ENC and `DEC function as a conditional compilation directive, internally guiding the application of `A and `B. The code block initiates with undefined `ENC and `DEC macros. Subsequently, `ENC is defined and values of `A and `B are printed under the condition `ENC. `ENC and `DEC are then undefined, succeeded by defining `DEC and printing values of `A and `B under `DEC. Lastly, `A and `B are displayed as undefined for `ENC and `DEC.
