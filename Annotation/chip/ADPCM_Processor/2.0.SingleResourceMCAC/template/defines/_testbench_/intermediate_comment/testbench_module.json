    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a test bench for diagnosing macros ENC and DEC with the variables `A and `B, with no hardware functionalities. By incorporating macros (`define, `include, `undef), the manipulation of these variables from the external file \"global_defines.vh\" is managed. It lacks input and output ports, indicating self-sufficient functionality. Internally, it uses `A and `B as defined in \"global_defines.vh\". Major operations include setting and unsetting `ENC and `DEC macros and displaying corresponding case values."
