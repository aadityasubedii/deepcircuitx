    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block primarily performs a test sequence for an ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation) codec using different rates and laws. It initiates with the configuration of the time format and sdf annotation only if `SDFSCAN` directive is enabled. Following this, it performs nested iterations for `rates`, `laws` and test vector index `j`. For each combination of rate-law pair, it loads respective DLN, DS, I vectors from memory using `$readmemh`. The loaded vectors are then scanned against each element and compared with the expected value `Is[j]`, displaying an error message and stopping the execution if the `BREAKONERR` directive is enabled and any discrepancy is identified. Throughout this process, additional verbose logs are enabled if the `VERBOSE` directive is active."
