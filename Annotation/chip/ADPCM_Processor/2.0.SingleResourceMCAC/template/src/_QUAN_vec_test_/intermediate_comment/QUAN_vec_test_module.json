    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module conducts testing on a 'QUAN' module (likely a quantizer), loading test vectors from memory, and operating QUAN with these. It interacts via 'DLN', 'DS', and 'RATE' inputs and checks the 'I' output against expected data. Iterating over rates, laws, 'DLNs', 'DSs', and 'Is', it details whether the test has passed or failed for each set of parameters."
