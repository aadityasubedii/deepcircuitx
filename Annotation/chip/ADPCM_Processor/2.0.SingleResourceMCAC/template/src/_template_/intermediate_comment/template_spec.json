It has two input ports, 'sig1' and 'sig2', with unspecified purposes, and an output port 'sig3', also with an undefined role. Internally, the module utilizes a collection of registers and wires: an 8-bit register '8bit_reg', single bit registers 'reg0', 'reg1', and 'reg2', an 8-bit wire '8bit_bus', and single bit wires 'wire0', 'wire1', and 'wire2'. These internal signals, while declared, do not hold specified roles within the provided code, as they are not used for any operations or assignments. In sum, the TEMPLATE module represents a skeleton or mold for a more functional RTL design wherein the undefined inputs, outputs, and internal signals would be incorporated into operations and data manipulations.",
