    "module": "Module-level comment: The TEMPLATE module serves as a structural placeholder with no specific operational roles. It has input ports 'sig1' and 'sig2' and an output port 'sig3', which along with internal signals ('8bit_reg', 'reg0', 'reg1', 'reg2', '8bit_bus', 'wire0', 'wire1', 'wire2'), are unused and have undefined roles. This module doesn't perform any explicit operations or assignments and acts as a skeleton for a more functional Verilog RTL design."
