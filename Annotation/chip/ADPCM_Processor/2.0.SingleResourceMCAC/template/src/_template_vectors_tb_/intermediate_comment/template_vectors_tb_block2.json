    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a periodic clock signal. It achieves this by continuously, at each interval denoted by half the defined `CLK_PERIOD`, inverting the value of `clk` using the bitwise NOT operator (~). This inversion results in a signal that toggles between two states (typically 0 and 1) at a regular interval, effectively creating a clock signal."
