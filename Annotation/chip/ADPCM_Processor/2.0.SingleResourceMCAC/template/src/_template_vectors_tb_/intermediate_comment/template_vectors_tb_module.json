    "module": "Module-level comment: Test is a comprehensive testbench module used for verification of hardware components represented as 'MODULE_NAME'. It conducts various tests involving different test vectors, operations, and types under varying clock rates and laws. Inputs are controlled using 'clk', 'reset', and scanning/testing ports. Outputs are validation results from the testing procedures. Internally, the module uses a range of variables for test cycle control and registers to store the test vectors, their sizes, and input-output pairs. The structure includes initialization, a clock signal generator, and nested loops for each test scenario, with an error detection mechanism and provision for backend tests and debug info display."
