    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module stands as a top-level unit used primarily to instantiate and manage the 'EXPAND' module, serving as an interface for controlling its behavior and analyzing its outputs. It takes inputs in the form of several 'scan_in' signals (scan_in0, scan_in1, scan_in2, scan_in3, scan_in4), a 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'; while the 'scan_out' signals (scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4) are its outputs. These input signals are used to exert control over the module, where 'clk' syncs the operations, 'reset' initializes the module into a known state, the 'scan_in' signals function as test pattern input for internal diagnostics, 'scan_enable' activates the test scan system, and 'test_mode' switches the module into its test operational mode. The 'scan_out' signals reflect the internal state of the circuit post test pattern injection and provide an external perspective into the internal operations of the module. Along with acting as input ports, 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in's, 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode', also function as internal signals, facilitating core functional aspects of the module such as synchronization, initialization, testing, and diagnostic operations. The module is also capable of performing Standard Delay Format (SDF) back-annotation under the instance 'SDFSCAN', transferring delay, constraint, and timing info from the gate-level timing analysis back to the RTL design for integrity verification of related functionalities.",

Typically, it is used to synchronize the operations of the module.\n\n2. reset: This is a reset signal, which is typically used to put the module into a known state at the start-up or any required instant.\n\n3. scan_in0, scan_in1, scan_in2, scan_in3, scan_in4: These are the scan inputs used in the module. They are typically used in test scenarios in digital circuit designs to control and observe internal states or interconnections of the ASIC or microprocessor in the system.\n\n4. scan_enable: This is also a part of the test scanning system. When activated, it allows the 'scan_in's to start injecting test patterns into the circuit.\n\n5. test_mode: This activation signal places the module in test mode for diagnostics or verification.\n\nExplanation: The input ports define the control signals for the module, allowing the system to affect its internal operations. The scan_in signals, when coupled with scan_enable, represent a scanning system used for internal testing of the module. The test_mode signal allows the system to switch the work mode of the circuit for performing self-tests for faults or ensuring it meets the design's initial intended purpose.\n\nOutput ports:\n\n1. scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4: These are the scan outputs used in the module.
