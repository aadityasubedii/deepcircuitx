    "block_comment": "This block initializes a testbench for a given digital system. It sets the time format for simulation and conditionally annotates Standard Delay Format (SDF) information if the SDFSCAN option is enabled. It also drives all test related inputs (like 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in', 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode') to zero to ensure a deterministic start state before test start. After initialization, the simulation finishes."
