Module name: test. 

Module specification: The 'test' module stands as a top-level unit used primarily to instantiate and manage the 'EXPAND' module, serving as an interface for controlling its behavior and analyzing its outputs. It takes inputs in the form of several 'scan_in' signals (scan_in0, scan_in1, scan_in2, scan_in3, scan_in4), a 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'; while the 'scan_out' signals (scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4) are its outputs. These input signals are used to exert control over the module, where 'clk' syncs the operations, 'reset' initializes the module into a known state, the 'scan_in' signals function as test pattern input for internal diagnostics, 'scan_enable' activates the test scan system, and 'test_mode' switches the module into its test operational mode. The 'scan_out' signals reflect the internal state of the circuit post test pattern injection and provide an external perspective into the internal operations of the module. Along with acting as input ports, 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in's, 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode', also function as internal signals, facilitating core functional aspects of the module such as synchronization, initialization, testing, and diagnostic operations. The module is also capable of performing Standard Delay Format (SDF) back-annotation under the instance 'SDFSCAN', transferring delay, constraint, and timing info from the gate-level timing analysis back to the RTL design for integrity verification of related functionalities.
