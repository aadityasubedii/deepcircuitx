Module-level comment: This 'test' module, serving as a top-level entity, manages the 'EXPAND' module for diagnostics and verification. It uses input ports like 'scan_in's for injecting test patterns, 'clk' for synchronization, 'reset' for initialization, 'scan_enable' for enabling the scan system, and 'test_mode' for setting the operational mode. The outputs, 'scan_out's, reflect the internal state post-test scanning. It is also capable of performing a timing analysis through SDF back-annotation under 'SDFSCAN'.
