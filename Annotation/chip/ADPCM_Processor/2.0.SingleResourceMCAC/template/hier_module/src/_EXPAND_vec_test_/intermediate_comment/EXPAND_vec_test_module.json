    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module is a setup and testing component for an `EXPAND` system, set in scan/test conditions via various input ports like 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'. It uses an 'EXPAND' instance and internal signals for synchronization, initialization, and test operations while returning scan results via output ports 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4'. The 'initial' block prepares the simulation with particular time format and optional SDF annotation, initializing registers to zero, and terminates the simulation process."
