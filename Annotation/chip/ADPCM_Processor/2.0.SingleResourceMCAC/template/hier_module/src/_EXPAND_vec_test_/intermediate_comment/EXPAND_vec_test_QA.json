This setup uses wires, registers, and an instance of the `EXPAND` system for operations. It starts by defining wires and registers, and then instantiates the `EXPAND` design. It provides appropriate inputs to this design and expects some outputs. The initial block sets the environment up for simulation (with time format and optional Standard Delay Format (SDF) based on a condition), initializes all the defined registers to zero, and then ends the simulation process."
