    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module is a preliminary setup and testing module utilized for the setup and testing of the `EXPAND` design in scan and test conditions. This involves the use of wires, registers, and an instance of the `EXPAND` system, configured and controlled through certain input and output ports. The input ports include 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'. 'reset' initializes the module, 'clk' synchronizes module operations, 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' serve as scan inputs for the EXPAND module, 'scan_enable' controls when the scanning operation is enabled and 'test_mode' sets the system to testing mode. The output ports are 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', which carry the results from the EXPAND module's scan test operations. Internal signals correspond to the same named input ports, aiding in internal tasks like synchronization with 'clk', initialization with 'reset', and test operations with scan inputs, 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'. The module comprises of an 'EXPAND' instance where all the defined inputs are wired to and outputs received from. Also, there's an 'initial' block that sets up the simulation environment, initializes all registers to zero, and ends the simulation process. It uses a time format for the simulation and includes an optional Standard Delay Format (SDF) based on a condition defined by 'SDFSCAN'.",
