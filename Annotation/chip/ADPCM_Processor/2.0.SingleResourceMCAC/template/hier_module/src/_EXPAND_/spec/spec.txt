Module name: EXPAND. 

Module specification: The EXPAND module is a part of a digital system, which seems to handle testing operations, possibly related to scan chain testing. This module is supplied with several input ports including a reset signal to initialize the system, a clock signal for timing, five scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4) for potentially feeding test data into a scan chain, a scan_enable signal to control the usage of the scan inputs, and a test_mode signal to determine whether the system is in regular operation or a testing phase. The outputs of the EXPAND module are five scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) that could represent the resultant data from the test chain. Since the provided Verilog code doesn't define any internal signals, the operation of the module internals and any internal signal structure cannot currently be determined. The functionality of the module blocks is also unclear as it is not implemented. This module is, therefore, a preliminary definition portraying the interface of a testing related module in a digital system.
