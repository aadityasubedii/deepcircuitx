It first calculates two helping parameters 'A1UL' and 'A1LL' using the input 'A2P' and a constant 'OME'. Afterwards, it analyses the value of input 'A1T' according to the range it belongs to. If 'A1T' lies within the range 32768 to 'A1LL', the value of 'A1P' will be updated with 'A1LL'. If 'A1T' falls within the range 'A1UL' to 32767, 'A1P' is updated with 'A1UL'. In all other cases, 'A1P' is identical to 'A1T'."
