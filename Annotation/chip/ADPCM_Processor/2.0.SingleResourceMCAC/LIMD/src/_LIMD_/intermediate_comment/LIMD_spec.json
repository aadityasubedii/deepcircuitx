    "spec": "Module name: LIMD. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe 'LIMD' module is a simple computing logic design implemented in Verilog. It takes two 16-bit inputs 'A1T' and 'A2P' and produces a 16-bit output 'A1P'. This module works by defining two internal signals 'A1UL' and 'A1LL', which act as upper and lower limits for 'A1T', respectively. The signals 'A1UL' and 'A1LL' are computed by the signal 'OME' (a constant value of 16'd15360) and input 'A2P', both contribute to a value of 65536 in different manners. Then, the value of 'A1P' is updated based on the range in which 'A1T' falls. If 'A1T' is within the range 32768 to 'A1LL', 'A1P' is updated with 'A1LL'. If 'A1T' falls within the range 'A1UL' to 32767, 'A1P' is updated with 'A1UL'. Otherwise, 'A1P' is identical to 'A1T'.\n\nInput ports include 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', 'test_mode', 'A1T', 'A2P'. 'reset' and 'clk' are used for reset and synchronization purposes in most digital designs but are not utilized in this module. The 'scan_in' ports, 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' likely belong to a testing interface, however, they aren't applied in this module. The functional inputs are 'A1T' and 'A2P'. \n\nOutput ports are 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' and 'A1P'. The 'scan_out' ports likely correlate with the corresponding 'scan_in' ports of a possible testing interface. 'A1P' is the final result which uses 'A1T' and 'A2P' as its determining factors.\n\nThe code has designated sections for declaring module ports and their type, identifying internal signals, and a main procedural block where all computations occur and output is decided based on the conditions.",
