    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block calculates and sets the value of A1P based on the inputs A1T and A2P. At each clock cycle (as indicated by 'always'), the code computes the intermediate values OME, A1UL, and A1LL. If A1T falls within the range [32768, A1LL], A1P is set to A1LL. If A1T is within the range [A1UL, 32767], A1P is set to A1UL. But if the conditions are not met then A1P is assigned the value of A1T. This mechanism is employed to maintain A1P within a specific range influenced by A1T and A2P."
