    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'LIMD' module in Verilog assigns a value to output 'A1P' based on the inputs 'A1T' and 'A2P'. It first computes 'A1UL' and 'A1LL', upper and lower limit signals, from 'A2P' and a constant 'OME'. Then, it checks the range in which 'A1T' falls. If 'A1T' is between 32768 and 'A1LL', or between 'A1UL' and 32767, 'A1P' is set to 'A1LL' or 'A1UL' respectively. Otherwise, 'A1P' equals 'A1T'."
