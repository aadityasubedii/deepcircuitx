Its primary purpose is to ascertain the performance, reliability, and correctness of the LIMD module by subjecting it to various combinations of input conditions. \n\nThe test module uses input ports such as clk, reset, scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_enable, and test_mode to control the timing, initialization, scanning, and testing modes of the LIMD operation. It also uses output ports; scan_out0 to scan_out4, and inout ports as A1T and A2P to receive output from the LIMD module and guide testing operations. Additionally, an inout port A1P helps in capturing output from LIMD module for further verification of expected outcomes.\n\nInternally, the test module utilizes array registers like rates, laws, operations, types, models, and vectorSizes, offering different combinations of parameters for testing. Variables such as rate, law, operation, type, model, j, and loop to loop through these arrays and maintain the test control flow. It also uses array registers like A1Ts, A2Ps, and A1Ps and variables A1T and A2P to store and manage test vector inputs to LIMD module during simulation.\n\nThe test module contains several blocks distinguished by their functionalities. After initial parameter definition and setting up of test conditions, two main iterative test loops present evaluate all possible combinations of input conditions and compare the LIMD output with expected values read from memory files, reporting any discrepancies. By this process, it ensures a thorough testing and validation of the LIMD module under different scenarios.",

Its primary purpose is to ascertain the performance, reliability, and correctness of the LIMD module by subjecting it to various combinations of input conditions. \n\nThe test module uses input ports such as clk, reset, scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_enable, and test_mode to control the timing, initialization, scanning, and testing modes of the LIMD operation. It also uses output ports; scan_out0 to scan_out4, and inout ports as A1T and A2P to receive output from the LIMD module and guide testing operations. Additionally, an inout port A1P helps in capturing output from LIMD module for further verification of expected outcomes.\n\nInternally, the test module utilizes array registers like rates, laws, operations, types, models, and vectorSizes, offering different combinations of parameters for testing. Variables such as rate, law, operation, type, model, j, and loop to loop through these arrays and maintain the test control flow. It also uses array registers like A1Ts, A2Ps, and A1Ps and variables A1T and A2P to store and manage test vector inputs to LIMD module during simulation.\n\nThe test module contains several blocks distinguished by their functionalities. After initial parameter definition and setting up of test conditions, two main iterative test loops present evaluate all possible combinations of input conditions and compare the LIMD output with expected values read from memory files, reporting any discrepancies. By this process, it ensures a thorough testing and validation of the LIMD module under different scenarios."
