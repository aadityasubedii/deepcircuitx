    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module, a comprehensive testbench for the LIMD module, verifies its performance and correctness through extensive testing scenarios. It uses input and output ports to control timing, initialization, and testing modes; internal array registers rate, law, operation, type, model, and loop to generate various parameters and control flow, plus array registers A1Ts, A2Ps, and A1Ps and variables A1T and A2P to manage test vector inputs during simulation. The module iteratively runs all possible input combinations, comparing LIMD output with expected values, reporting discrepancies, thus achieving a thorough validation of the LIMD module design."
