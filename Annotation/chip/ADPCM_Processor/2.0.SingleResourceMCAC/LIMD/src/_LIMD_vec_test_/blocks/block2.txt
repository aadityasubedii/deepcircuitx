Comment: 
This block of code generates a clock signal. It does this by toggling the `clk` signal every half of a clock period, defined by `CLK_PERIOD`, creating a clock cycle uniform to `CLK_PERIOD`. This is an always block that's sensitive to time delay indicated by `#(`CLK_PERIOD/2)`, making the inversion occur at regular intervals.
