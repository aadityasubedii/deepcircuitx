This block initialises various test parameters and performs multi-layered tests based on parameters such as model, rate, operation, type, and law. For each combination of these parameters, this block reads some test vector data from external files and performs iterations comparing actual hardware output against expected results. If there's a discrepancy, an error is displayed with detailed information. It sets time format, optionally annotates delay information from SDF file, initializes analog values and performs two sets of complex, nested FOR-loop based tests. These tests iterate through different models, rates, operations, types, and laws, displaying each combination, reading in corresponding vector results from files for comparison. If discrepancies are found during testing, an error message is displayed alongside pertinent information. It also contains optional verbose prints and stop execution on the first error based on preprocessor directives. The block concludes by indicating test completion and calling the $finish system task to terminate the simulation.
