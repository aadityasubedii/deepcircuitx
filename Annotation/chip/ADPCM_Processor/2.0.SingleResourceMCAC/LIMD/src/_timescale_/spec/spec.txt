Based on your request, I understand that you're seeking a detailed specification for a Verilog module. However, the original Verilog code provided ("`timescale 1ns / 1ns") doesn't define or contain any Verilog modules. This piece of the code is a directive in Verilog called Timescale. It's responsible for setting the time unit and precision for the following modules in the code. As such, it is impossible to extract details such as the module name, its functionality, the input and output ports, any internal signals, or any blocks or sections from this line of code.

Until you provide a more detailed piece of Verilog code containing an actual module, I regrettably cannot provide the specified detailed information in your requested format.

In a typical situation when a module is provided, the answer should be in this format:

Module name: [module name]
Module specification: The [module name] serves the purpose of [module functionality]. It has the following ports:
1. Input: [input ports] used for [explanation of each input port]
2. Output: [output ports] used for [explanation of each output port]
The module contains the following internal signals: [internal signals], each serving the purpose of [explanation of each internal signal].
This module is broken down into [number of blocks] blocks which respectively serve the purpose of [function of each block or section].
