    "block_comment": "This is an initialization block that sets up the simulation environment and initial conditions. It sets the time format for the simulation to nanoseconds and annotates the Delay Standard Format (SDF) timing information on the \"test.top\" module if SDFSCAN is defined. This initialization block then sets the initial states of various inputs and control signals (clk, reset, scan_in0 - scan_in4, scan_enable, test_mode) in the testbench to zero, and ends the simulation."
