    "spec": "Module name: Test.\n\nModule specification:\n\nThis 'test' module serves as a testbench for an evidently complex system denoted 'LIMD'. The functionality of the main LIMD system is not clearly described within the provided code, but it is understood that this test module's purpose is to verify its functionality. This is performed through the initialization and control of a variety of signals, and the use of connections to the LIMD system. In addition, this testbench configures the time-format for simulation and has provisions incorporated for sdf annotation, generally used for analyzing the timing behavior of a circuit during simulation.\n\nThe module incorporates both input and output ports. The input ports include 'clk', an essential clock signal that controls the timing of the system; 'reset', a signal that brings the system back to an initial or known state. It also includes 'scan_in0 to scan_in4', these being input scan chain mechanism signals used for circuit testing; 'scan_enable', a control signal that allows the scan inputs to have an effect when set; and 'test_mode', another control signal that activates a testing mode in the system when set. The output port includes 'scan_out0 to scan_out4' which are used to provide results from scan testing.\n\nInternal signals utilized within the module encompass 'scan_out0 to scan_out4', 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_in0 to scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'. The 'scan_out0 to scan_out4' output scan chain signals are used to observe the states of internal flip-flops within the circuit during testing and provide the output of a scan test. 'reset' and 'clk' signals serve the same purposes as previously explained, and 'scan_in0 to scan_in4' are those input scan chain signals used for feeding test data into the circuit. 'scan_enable' when activated, permits scan inputs to amend the internal states of the circuit, whereas 'test_mode', when activated, puts the system into   a testing mode.\n\nThe code can essentially be divided into two primary sections. The first segment incorporates the definition and initialization of all the input, output, and internal signals, including the 'LIMD' system instance, along with their respective connections. The second segment, which is encapsulated within the 'initial...begin' syntax, mainly handles the initialization of all signals and ends the simulation with the '$finish' directive. Additionally, it also includes provisions for sdf annotation with '$sdf_annotate'.",
