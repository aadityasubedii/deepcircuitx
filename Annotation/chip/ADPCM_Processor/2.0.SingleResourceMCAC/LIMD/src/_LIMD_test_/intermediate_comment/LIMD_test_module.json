    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for a system 'LIMD', providing test-specific control and input, and collecting output. Its implementation includes a variety of signals like 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' as inputs. The 'scan_out0 to scan_out4' outputs contain scan test results. Its two main segments encompass the definition and initialization of signals, and signal value assignments for simulation. An option for sdf annotation is included, indicating an intent for circuit timing behavior analysis during simulation."
