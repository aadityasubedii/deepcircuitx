    "block_comment": "This block performs conditional assignment to the signal MANT based on a comparison with the signal MAG. If the signal MAG equals to 0, then MANT will be assigned a value of 32. If not, MANT will be given the value of MAG concatenated with a six-bit zero, then right-shifted by EXP. The operation provides a way to dynamically change the value of MANT according to the values of MAG and EXP."
