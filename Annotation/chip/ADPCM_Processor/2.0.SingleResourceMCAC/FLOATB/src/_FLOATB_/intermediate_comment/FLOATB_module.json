    "module": "Module-level comment: The FLOATB module converts a 16-bit signed binary input (SR) into a 11-bit floating-point number (SR0). This is accomplished using internal signals: SRS (sign), MAG (magnitude of SR), EXP (count of MAG's leading zeros, treated as an exponent), and MANT (mantissa, obtained by right-shifting MAG by EXP bits). Additionally, it includes provisions for scan chain operation and operation mode switching for test purposes.\n"
