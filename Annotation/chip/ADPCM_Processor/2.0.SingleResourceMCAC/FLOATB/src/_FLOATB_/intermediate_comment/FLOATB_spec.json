    "spec": "Module name: FLOATB. \n\nModule specification: The FLOATB module is designed to convert 16-bit signed binary input into a 11-bit floating-point representation that consists of a sign, an exponent, and a mantissa. The input ports of the module include `reset` and `clk` which are normally used to set all registers to a default value and synchronizing actions within the module respectively. Other inputs include `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` and `scan_enable` that likely relate to scan chain operations, and `test_mode` which is thought to be pertaining to switching between normal and testing mode. The main input, `SR`, is the 16-bit signed binary signal to be processed. The output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` which probably picture the external output during scan chain operations or testing, and `SR0`, the final 11-bit output. \n\nInternally, the module employs signals such as `SRS` for holding the sign of the input `SR` value, `MAG` to calculate and hold the SR's magnitude, `EXP` for finding the number of leading zeros in `MAG` thus acting as the exponent part, and `MANT` that functions as the mantissa by holding the significant digits obtained by right-shifting `MAG` by `EXP` bits. In the distinct blocks or sections of the code, there are portions that adjust and prepare these internal signals in order to correctly represent the processed `SR` input in a floating-point format on output `SR0`.",

The FLOATB module appears to take an input signal `SR` with 16 bits, including a sign bit, and then it calculates the magnitude `MAG` based on the sign. Depending on the number of leading zeroes in `MAG`, it generates an exponent `EXP` via a case statement. Moreover, it seems to modifies the magnitude value `MAG` based on the calculated `EXP`, and assigns it to variable `MANT`. At last, it combines the sign bit, exponent, and modified magnitude into a 12-bit output `SR0`. Overall, it appears that the module is involved in some form of floating-point number conversion or representation."
