    "block_comment": "The block in question is designed to determine the exponent of a given 15-bit number, represented as 'MAG'. Depending on the leading bit set to '1' in 'MAG', it assigns an appropriate exponent to 'EXP'. The block of code leverages a casez statement, a specific version of the switch-case construct in Verilog, to match patterns with 'don't care' elements marked with '?'. For example, 15'b1?????????????? will match any 15-bit value starting with a '1'. On each match, it will assign a fixed integer value to 'EXP' which is basically the position of the most significant bit set to '1'. If 'MAG' doesn't match any cases, by default, 'EXP' is assigned 0 indicating the number at hand is zero."
