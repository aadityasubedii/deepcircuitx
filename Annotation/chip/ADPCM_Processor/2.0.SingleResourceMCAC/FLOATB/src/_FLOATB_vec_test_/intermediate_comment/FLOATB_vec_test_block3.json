    "block_comment": "This code block functions as a clock signal generator of a digital circuit in the Verilog hardware description language. It runs continuously throughout program execution, toggling the clock's value at half the period defined by `CLK_PERIOD`. The `~` operator is a bitwise negation operator, effectively flipping the value of the clock between 0 and 1, thus emulating the rising and falling edges of a clock signal."
