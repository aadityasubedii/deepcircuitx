    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe 'test' module is a Verilog code without explicit functionality explained in the code but seems to be used as a testbench for another module \"FLOATB\". It primarily contains five wire-type scan outputs and several inputs including clock, reset and some scan inputs. It also includes the initialization of an instance of the \u201cFLOATB\u201d module.\n\nThe inputs to this module include signals reset, clk, scan_in0, scan_in1, scan_in2, scan_in3, scan_in4, scan_enable, and test_mode. The reset and clock are standard system signals used to bring the system to an initial state and synchronize operations respectively. The five scan_in ports serve as scan chains to shift in test data for circuit testing. The scan_enable and the test_mode are used to enable scan mode and test mode respectively. \n\nThe outputs include scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, and scan_out4 which are output scan chains meant to gather and shift out the test results from the circuit after the test data have been shifted in through the input scan chains.\n\nInternal signals are the same as the input and output ports - which include scan input and output, clock, reset, scan enable and test mode. Their purposes have been detailed above under inputs and outputs explanation.\n\nThe \"FLOATB\" instance is a section in the code where all the inputs and outputs are passed across from the 'test' module to the 'FLOATB' module. If 'SDFSCAN' is defined, the sdf_annotate command provides a path to the Standard Delay Format (SDF) of the 'FLOATB' module for enhanced timing simulation. Initial settings for all registers are also provided in the module, with all being set to their default state (0).\n",
