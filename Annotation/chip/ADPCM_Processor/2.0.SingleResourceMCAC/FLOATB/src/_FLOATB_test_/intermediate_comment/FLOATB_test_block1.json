    "block_comment": "The block represents the initialization sequence in a Verilog testbench context. The simulation time format is set initially. It accommodates for a potential SDFSCAN feature for further Debugging and Simulation Back Annotation. Various signals like clock, reset, scan inputs, scan enable and test mode are initialized to low (0) state. The completion denotes the end of the initialization phase."
