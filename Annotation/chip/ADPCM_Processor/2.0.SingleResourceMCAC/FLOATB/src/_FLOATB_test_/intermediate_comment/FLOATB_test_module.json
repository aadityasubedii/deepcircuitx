    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"test\" module serves as a testbench, likely for the \"FLOATB\" module. It contains five scan inputs and scan outputs each, as well as a clock, a reset, a scan enable, and a test mode signals. It initializes an instance of \"FLOATB\", passing all these signals as inputs and outputs. If 'SDFSCAN' is defined, it runs sdf_annotate for enhanced timing simulation. It initializes all registers to 0 at the beginning."
