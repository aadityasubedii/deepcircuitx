Comment: 
Unfortunately, the segment of the Verilog RTL code you have provided is an "endmodule" statement, which marks the end of a module definition. It doesn't contain sufficient information to summarize the function and implementation details of the block of code. Can you provide a complete module or block of code for a better understanding and comment generation?
