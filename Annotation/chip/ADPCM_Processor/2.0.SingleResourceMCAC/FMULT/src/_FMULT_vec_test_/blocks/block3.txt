Comment: 
The block generates a clock signal with a period defined by the macro `CLK_PERIOD`. This is achieved by toggling the signal `clk` after every half period of the clock, using the `always` statement and delay syntax of Verilog. The clock signal `clk` starts at its initial value and inverts its state every `CLK_PERIOD/2` units of simulation time.
