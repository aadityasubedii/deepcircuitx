    "block_comment": "This block initializes several arrays used for defining different parameters of a digital system. It does this by assigning a specific string value to the array indices at simulation start-up. Each array represents different categories such as rates, laws, operations, types, and models, and each category can take predetermined values. For instance, `rates` can have values like \"40\", \"32\", \"24\", \"16\"; `laws` can be \"AA\", \"MM\", \"AM\", \"MA\"; `operations` can be \"nrm\", \"ovr\", \"i\"; `types` can be classified as \"reset\" or \"homing\"; and `models` can be either \"enc\" for encoder or \"dec\" for decoder."
