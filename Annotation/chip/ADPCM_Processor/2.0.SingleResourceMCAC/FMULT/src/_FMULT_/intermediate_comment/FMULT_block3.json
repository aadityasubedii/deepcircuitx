    "block_comment": "The code block assigns a value to the variable WAnWBnMANT based on the evaluation of a condition. The condition checks if the value of AnBnMAG is true, in which case the calculation involving a bit shift of AnBnMAG concatenated with 6'b000000 to the right by AnBnEXP subtly multiplies the result with SRnDQnMANT and adds a hexadecimal 12'h030 to the final result, else (the condition is false) it multiplies hexadecimal 6'h20 with SRnDQnMANT followed by adding 12'h030 to get the final value assigned to WAnWBnMANT. This block essentially performs arithmetic operations based on conditions, adjusting the magnitude of SRnDQnMANT based on the status of AnBnMAG and manipulates the data accordingly, using binary and hexadecimal computations."
