    "module": "Module-level comment: The module FMULT is a floating-point multiplier that takes two inputs 'AnBn' and 'SRnDQn' and calculates their product as 'WAnWBn'. Inputs and outputs are split into sign, exponent, and mantissa before and after calculation respectively. It has additional scan and test signals for debugging. Module operation is synchronized with a clock signal and can be reset. Internally, the module uses bitwise operations, conditional assignments, and a case statement for exponent calculation."
