    "spec": "Module name: FMULT. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe FMULT module is coded in Verilog and represents a floating point multiplier. It is specifically designed to take two floating-point inputs and produce one floating-point output that is the product of the two input values. Edge cases are also considered, making the module suitable for hardware applications that specifically require floating-point multiplication operations.\n\nThe input ports of the FMULT module include a reset for initializing the module, a clock signal for synchronization, 'scan_in' signals (0 to 4) and a 'scan_enable' signal for enabling or disabling the scan mode, a 'test_mode' for determining mode of operation, and 'AnBn' and 'SRnDQn' floating-point inputs. The output ports include 'scan_out' signals (0 to 4) that might be used for circuit testability, and 'WAnWBn', the result of the floating-point multiplication operation.\n\nThe FMULT module leverages several internal signals to execute its function. These signals decipher the floating-point input and output values into component parts such as the sign, exponent, and mantissa. The sign bits of the input are stored in 'AnBnS' and 'SRnDQnS' signals, the magnitudes in 'AnBnMAG' and 'WAnWBnMAG', and the exponents and mantissa in 'AnBnEXP', 'SRnDQnEXP', 'WAnWBnEXP', 'SRnDQnMANT', and 'WAnWBnMANT'. The sign of the output is determined by an exclusive OR operation of 'AnBnS' and 'SRnDQnS'.\n\nThe Verilog code for FMULT module is organized into several blocks. It starts with module and port declarations, continues with internal signal declarations and assignments, moves onto a block that calculates the exponent part of the 'AnBn' input through a case statement, and then ends with assignments of the output floating-point components and finally the result. Each block performs specific calculations required for the multiplication operation based on the floating-point representation rules, and together, they help the module accurately execute the floating-point multiplication operations.",

The module takes two floating-point inputs - AnBn and SRnDQn, performs a multiplication operation, and outputs the result as WAnWBn. The input floating-point numbers are separated into sign, exponent, and mantissa and a series of calculations are performed using these components, following the rules of floating-point multiplication. The outcome is re-combined into a floating-point number. The module also considers different edge cases.

It is specifically designed to take two floating-point inputs and produce one floating-point output that is the product of the two input values. Edge cases are also considered, making the module suitable for hardware applications that specifically require floating-point multiplication operations.\n\nThe input ports of the FMULT module include a reset for initializing the module, a clock signal for synchronization, 'scan_in' signals (0 to 4) and a 'scan_enable' signal for enabling or disabling the scan mode, a 'test_mode' for determining mode of operation, and 'AnBn' and 'SRnDQn' floating-point inputs. The output ports include 'scan_out' signals (0 to 4) that might be used for circuit testability, and 'WAnWBn', the result of the floating-point multiplication operation.\n\nThe FMULT module leverages several internal signals to execute its function. These signals decipher the floating-point input and output values into component parts such as the sign, exponent, and mantissa. The sign bits of the input are stored in 'AnBnS' and 'SRnDQnS' signals, the magnitudes in 'AnBnMAG' and 'WAnWBnMAG', and the exponents and mantissa in 'AnBnEXP', 'SRnDQnEXP', 'WAnWBnEXP', 'SRnDQnMANT', and 'WAnWBnMANT'. The sign of the output is determined by an exclusive OR operation of 'AnBnS' and 'SRnDQnS'.\n\nThe Verilog code for FMULT module is organized into several blocks. It starts with module and port declarations, continues with internal signal declarations and assignments, moves onto a block that calculates the exponent part of the 'AnBn' input through a case statement, and then ends with assignments of the output floating-point components and finally the result. Each block performs specific calculations required for the multiplication operation based on the floating-point representation rules, and together, they help the module accurately execute the floating-point multiplication operations."
