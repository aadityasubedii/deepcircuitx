The module takes two floating-point inputs - AnBn and SRnDQn, performs a multiplication operation, and outputs the result as WAnWBn. The input floating-point numbers are separated into sign, exponent, and mantissa and a series of calculations are performed using these components, following the rules of floating-point multiplication. The outcome is re-combined into a floating-point number. The module also considers different edge cases. Can be used in applications where floating-point multiplication operation is needed in hardware, such as DSPs, GPUs and specific arithmetic units.\n"
