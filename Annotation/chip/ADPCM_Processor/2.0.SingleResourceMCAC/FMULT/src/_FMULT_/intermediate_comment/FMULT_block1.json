    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a conditional assignment statement for the variable `WAnWBn`. The functionality of this block depends on the value of `WAnWBnS`. If `WAnWBnS` is high (`1`), then `WAnWBn` is assigned the difference of the hexadecimal value `17'h10000` and `WAnWBnMAG` (after prepending 2'b00 bits to it for correct bit-alignment with the hexadecimal value). Otherwise, if `WAnWBnS` is low (`0`), `WAnWBn` gets directly assigned the value of `WAnWBnMAG`. This design allows for conditional computation or manipulation of `WAnWBn` value based on the `WAnWBnS` signal."
