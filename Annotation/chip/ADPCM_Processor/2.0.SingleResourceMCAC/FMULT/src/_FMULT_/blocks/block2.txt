Comment: 
This block of Verilog code performs a scaling operation. It scales `WAnWBnMAG` based on the exponent `WAnWBnEXP` using a conditional shift operation. If `WAnWBnEXP` is less than 27, it right shifts `{WAnWBnMANT[11:4], 7'b0000000}` by the difference between 26 and `WAnWBnEXP`. Otherwise, it left shifts `{WAnWBnMANT[11:4], 7'b0000000}` by the difference between `WAnWBnEXP` and 26.
