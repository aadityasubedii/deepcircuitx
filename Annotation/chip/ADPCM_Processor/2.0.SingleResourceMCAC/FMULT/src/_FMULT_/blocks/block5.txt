This block executes a priority encoder operation on a 13-bit input `AnBnMAG`. It follows a casez statement structure in Verilog that checks for the first '1' in the input from the highest order bit and assigns the corresponding hexadecimal value to `AnBnEXP`. The casez structure uses wildcard matches for the remaining bits ensuring priority in case multiple '1's exist in the input. In the event where no match is found, the default clause assigns '0' to `AnBnEXP`.
