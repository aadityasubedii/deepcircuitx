This block performs a bitwise addition operation. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used to create continuous assignment statements, which means the output will change whenever there's a change to the inputs. Here, the variables `AnBnEXP` and `SRnDQnEXP` serve as the inputs and `WAnWBnEXP` as the output. Computing the sum of `AnBnEXP` and `SRnDQnEXP`, it assigns the result to `WAnWBnEXP`.
