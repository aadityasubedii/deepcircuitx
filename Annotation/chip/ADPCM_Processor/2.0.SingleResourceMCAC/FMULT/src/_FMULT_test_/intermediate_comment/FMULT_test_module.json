    "module": "Module-level comment: This 'test' module acts as a testbench for the FMULT module in Verilog code. It initialises the FMULT module with default inputs (all set to zero), toggling the digital system 'clk', system reset, scan chain inputs, and enabling functionality modes namely 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode'. It also handles scan chain outputs for debug or validation. No ongoing operations or test cases are detected post-initialisation. If SDFSCAN is defined, an SDF file is utilized to further increase testability."
