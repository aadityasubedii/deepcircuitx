    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module functions as a testbench for the 'FMULT_ACCUM' module. It employs scan-test methodology using 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', controlled by 'scan_enable', to input tests. A 'test_mode' register enables the testing environment. The 'clk' and 'reset' registers, utilized for operation synchronization and system resetting respectively, along with test signals and test mode, are all initialized upon module execution. No explicit input or output ports exist, since it serves as a self-contained unit for testing 'FMULT_ACCUM'. When SDFSCAN is defined, it performs more accurate simulations by annotating SDF timing information."
