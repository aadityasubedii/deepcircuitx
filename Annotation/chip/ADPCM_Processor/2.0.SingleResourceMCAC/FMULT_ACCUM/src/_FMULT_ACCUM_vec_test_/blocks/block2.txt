This block of Verilog code is responsible for generating a clock signal. The clock signal is defined by the constant `CLK_PERIOD` and it toggles its state every half of `CLK_PERIOD`. The toggling is achieved by using the `always` keyword, with a delay of `CLK_PERIOD/2` and then inverting (`~`) the `clk` signal. The frequency of the clock is determined through `CLK_PERIOD`. This structure is commonly used to simulate a clock in testbenches.
