    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a comprehensive testing suite for the DSP module 'FMULT_ACCUM'. It employs an exhaustive variety of test scenarios, read from files with $readmemh, to simulate the behavior of the module. It uses various internal signals, assigned test vectors from external files, to feed the FMULT_ACCUM module and subsequently its output is compared with expected results. Discrepancies are flagged and printed as errors, rigorously evaluating the design under test."
