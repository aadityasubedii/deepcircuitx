Module-level comment: "FMULT_ACCUM is a Verilog RTL module that performs floating point multiplication and accumulation on multiple input data sets. Controlled by a state system `in_sel`, it makes use of two sub-modules - FMULT (for multiplication) and ACCUM (for accumulation) - for processing the inputs. Additional control signals such as `reset`, `start`, and `clk` are used to manage the synchronous operations. Module includes a scan test mode to enable test functionality, managed by control signals `test_mode` and `scan_enable` with corresponding inputs `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` and outputs `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`. On completion of data processing, outputs `sez` and `se` are populated and `done` signal is triggered."
