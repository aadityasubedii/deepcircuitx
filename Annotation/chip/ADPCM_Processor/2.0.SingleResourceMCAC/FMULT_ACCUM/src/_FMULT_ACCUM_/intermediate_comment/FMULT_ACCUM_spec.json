    "spec": "Module name: FMULT_ACCUM\n\nModule specification: The FMULT_ACCUM module is a complex data processing unit for a Floating Point Multiplier with an Accumulator. This module encapsulates functionality related to multiplication operation and accumulation of the results based on supplied 16-bit operand and 11-bit data inputs. The operations are controlled by a clock signal (`clk`), with a reset (`reset`) and start (`start`) signal dictating the initialization and timing of the processing. In addition to the standard operating mode, the module has functionality to switch to a test mode controlled by `scan_enable` and `test_mode` inputs, with scanning data inputs `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` and corresponding outputs `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`. The operations yield two 15-bit wide outputs, `sez` and `se`, that embody the computation's result, and a `done` signal indicating the completion of operations.\n\nInternally, the module notable signals are `f1` and `f2` that hold the accumulating input data, `in_sel` which serves as a state variable, `S` and `W` that interlink the data between sub-module computations, and internal `clear` and `done` signals. Module includes two sub-modules, named FMULT and ACCUM that respectively perform multiplication and accumulation. The data-path of the module entails these computational units which process the data inputs as per an elaborative state machine (case construct) coded inside an always block that checks for rising edges of `reset`, `clk`. The entire system is synchronous and state-driven, transitioning from one operation to another based on the current state of the `in_sel` signal, with intermediary values and control signals adjusted accordingly. Upon completion, the `done` signal is triggered and outputs `sez` and `se` are updated. Test mode and scan functionality are additional features of the design.",

                    "text": "Module name: FMULT_ACCUM\n\nModule specification: The FMULT_ACCUM module is a complex data processing unit for a Floating Point Multiplier with an Accumulator. This module encapsulates functionality related to multiplication operation and accumulation of the results based on supplied 16-bit operand and 11-bit data inputs. The operations are controlled by a clock signal (`clk`), with a reset (`reset`) and start (`start`) signal dictating the initialization and timing of the processing. In addition to the standard operating mode, the module has functionality to switch to a test mode controlled by `scan_enable` and `test_mode` inputs, with scanning data inputs `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` and corresponding outputs `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`. The operations yield two 15-bit wide outputs, `sez` and `se`, that embody the computation's result, and a `done` signal indicating the completion of operations.\n\nInternally, the module notable signals are `f1` and `f2` that hold the accumulating input data, `in_sel` which serves as a state variable, `S` and `W` that interlink the data between sub-module computations, and internal `clear` and `done` signals. Module includes two sub-modules, named FMULT and ACCUM that respectively perform multiplication and accumulation. The data-path of the module entails these computational units which process the data inputs as per an elaborative state machine (case construct) coded inside an always block that checks for rising edges of `reset`, `clk`. The entire system is synchronous and state-driven, transitioning from one operation to another based on the current state of the `in_sel` signal, with intermediary values and control signals adjusted accordingly. Upon completion, the `done` signal is triggered and outputs `sez` and `se` are updated. Test mode and scan functionality are additional features of the design."
