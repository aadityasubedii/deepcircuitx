    "block_comment": "The functional objective of this block is to execute a set of operations when a system is in its reset state, or processing mode defined by \"start\". When the system is reset, it initializes various variables to their default values. However, when the \"start\" signal is high, it performs certain operations controlled by the \"in_sel\" control signal. This includes updating 'f1' and 'f2' values based on the 'in_sel' signal value and increasing 'in_sel' after each operation. The process also involves managing some flags like 'clear', 'done' and adjusting 'sez' and 'se' values. This block employs case statements to handle different 'in_sel' values thereby providing a mechanism to control the flow of program based on the 'in_sel' signal."
