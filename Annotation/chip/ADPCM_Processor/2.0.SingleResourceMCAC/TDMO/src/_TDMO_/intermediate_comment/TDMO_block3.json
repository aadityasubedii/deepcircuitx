    "block_comment": "This block executes a grey code counter operation in response to input signals. It responds to a rising edge of a clock signal or a reset signal. During reset, it initializes variables to specific binary values. When a frame_sync_in signal is detected, it executes XOR operations between Grey counter values and updates the next channel bit. If the frame_sync_in signal is inactive, it performs similar XOR operations on the Grey counter, increments it, and updates the next bit. In addition, when the next bit equals \"100\", the next channel is incremented."
