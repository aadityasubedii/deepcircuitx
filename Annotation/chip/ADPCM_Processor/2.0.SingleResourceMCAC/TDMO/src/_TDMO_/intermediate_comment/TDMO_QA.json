The module includes registers for storing data of different channels, input and output ports for data, control signals, clock signals, and test mode operations. It accomplishes gray code bit counting, takes frame synchronization input and gives frame synchronization output. It also supports data scanning, has a clock buffer, and clock inversion. Moreover, the module handles wishbone protocol signals implying that it can be interfaced with wishbone standard devices/system-on-chip. The wishbone interfaces allow different channels to write data to data registers and read data from data registers, which subsequently can be multiplexed and transmitted through the communication line. The serialization of the data is done as per the wishbone cycles and strobes. The output data are clocked out based on the channel and bit count. The TDMO module appears to operate with the Verilog RTL design environment, as indicated by properties such as posedge, reset, case operations, and continuous assignments."
