    "module": "Module-level comment: The TDMO module implements a Time Division Multiplexer using Verilog for multi-channel data transmission over a single line. It leverages scan input signals, frame synchronization, and Wishbone protocol control signals for cohesive operation. Utilizes bit and channel counts, data and frame registers for data management; and maintains a synchronized operation via extensive use of clock buffers. Simultaneously offers a 'test mode' for diagnostic testing and error detection via the o_wb_err signal."
