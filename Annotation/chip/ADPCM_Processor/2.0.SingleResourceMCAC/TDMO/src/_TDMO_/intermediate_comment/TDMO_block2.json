    "block_comment": "This block specifies the behavior of a digital circuit to handle serial data transmission using a clock signal. It operates on the rising edge of a dedicated serial clock or upon system reset. On reset, it clears variables used for counting and data storage. For all other clock cycles, it updates the counts and data registers with new incoming values for transmission, including a frame register and data output register."
