    "block_comment": "This code block initializes test settings for a module during simulation. It starts by setting up the time format for simulation, and then performs a conditional check to see if the SDFSCAN flag is defined. If this flag is defined, it annotates timings from the \"TDMO_tsmc18_scan.sdf\" file onto the module defined as \"test.top\". Following this, it initializes various signals including clock, reset and scan inputs etc. to logic '0' and this block ends by calling $finish to halt the simulator after initialization, waiting for a reset."
