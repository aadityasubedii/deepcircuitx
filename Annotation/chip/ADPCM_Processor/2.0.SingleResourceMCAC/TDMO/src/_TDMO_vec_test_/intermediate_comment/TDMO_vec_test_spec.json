    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module serves as a testing frame for another module named 'TDMO'. Its core purpose is to provide the necessary settings for creating a testbench, which includes setting up wires, registers, and an instance of the 'TDMO' module. The module does not immediately perform any functionality as it initially sets all conditions to a zero value and runs the '$finish' command to halt the simulation.\n\nThe input ports of this module are `clk`, `reset`, `scan_in0`, `scan_in1`, `scan_in2`,`scan_in3`, `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode`. `clk` acts as the clock signal for synchronizing the module, `reset` is the reset signal to establish initial state. The scan input pins (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`) are utilized for injecting test data into the circuit. The `scan_enable` signal activates scan mode, while `test_mode` enables the testing mode of the circuit. \n\nThe output ports of this module are `scan_out0`, `scan_out1`, `scan_out2`, `scan_out3`, `scan_out4`, which serve to get the output data after performing the scan test.\n\nThis module uses internal signals like `clk`, `reset`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`. These signals function similarly to their input counterparts, mainly to handle the synchronization, resetting, testing data input, initiating the scan mode, and enabling the test mode of the 'TDMO' module. \n\nThe internal blocks in the code include an initial block, which focuses on setting up the initial conditions by assigning zero values to all variables and then finishing the operation. Furthermore, the conditional compilation directive `ifdef` is used for triggering the SDF annotations if it's defined, which sets the specific design constraints for simulation or timing verification.",
