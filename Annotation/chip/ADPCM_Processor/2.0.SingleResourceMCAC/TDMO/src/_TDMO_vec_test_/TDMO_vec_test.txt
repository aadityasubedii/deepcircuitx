Module-level comment: The 'test' module forms a testbench for the 'TDMO' module by implementing necessary wires, registers, and a 'TDMO' instance. It has input ports for the clock, reset, test data, scan enable and test mode signals, and output ports for scan test results. It uses these signals to synchronize and control scan testing. Internally, it initializes these signals to zero and finishes the operation for simulation. SDF annotations are optionally triggered to apply design constraints for simulation or timing verification.
