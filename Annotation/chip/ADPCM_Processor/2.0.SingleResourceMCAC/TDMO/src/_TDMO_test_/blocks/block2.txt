Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles setting and updating of the wishbone bus (wb) signals on the rising edge of the clock. In each clock cycle, the address for the wishbone bus (i_wb_adr) is updated to the test address (wb_address_test). The cyc (i_wb_cyc) and stb (i_wb_stb) signals are set to high, indicating an active bus cycle and a valid data strobe respectively. Finally, the write enable signal (i_wb_we) is set to low, implying that data should not be written in this clock cycle.
