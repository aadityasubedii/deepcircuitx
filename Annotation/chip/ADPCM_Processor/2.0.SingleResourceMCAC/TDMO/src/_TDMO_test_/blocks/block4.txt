This code defines a task for writing data to a wishbone bus interface. Its functionality includes receiving 32-bit write address and data as input, setting the respective signals, and following the wishbone protocol for proceeding with the write operation. In the first clock cycle post edge, the write address and data inputs are captured in wishbone format (i_wb_adr and i_wb_dat). The cycle (i_wb_cyc), strobe (i_wb_stb), and write enable (i_wb_we) signals are also set to high. In the next clock cycle, the write enable, cycle, and strobe signals are reset to facilitate the termination of the write operation as per the wishbone protocol.
