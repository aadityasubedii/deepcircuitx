It performs this by running various test cases defined as tasks in the module. There are different cases tested via the \"initial begin\" block, which includes writing and reading data, handling the system clock and serial clock periods, and verifying output data with expected values using assertion checks. It also uses auxiliary tasks named 'wb_write_strobe' and 'wb_read_strobe' for writing and reading data via Wishbone (a widely used open source hardware interface). The presence of `$stop;` along with condition checks further implies that this module is intended to halt program execution upon encountering an error while testing."
