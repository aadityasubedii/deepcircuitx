    "block_comment": "This is a task that controls the read operation on a Wishbone bus. In the first clock cycle, it sets the address to be read (given as an input to the task), and signals that a valid cycle should start and that a valid data transfer should happen, with no write operation as indicated by the `i_wb_we` line. After two more clock cycles, it shut downs both the cycle and the strobe, indicating the end of the current operation."
