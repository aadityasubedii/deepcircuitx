    "module": "Module-level comment: This 'test' module operates to validate the functionality of the 'TDMO' module by running an array of test cases. Using the 'initial' block, it triggers scan testing operations, controls system and serial clocks, and manages data transfers through a Wishbone bus interface. Internal signals and tasks controlling the Wishbone read/write operations facilitate these processes. The module halts upon detecting errors and confirms successful test completion, providing an essential overview of the tested module's performance."
