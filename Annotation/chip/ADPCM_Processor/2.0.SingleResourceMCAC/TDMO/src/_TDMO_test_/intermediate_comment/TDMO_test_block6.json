    "block_comment": "The block of code initializes and tests a data channel system, within constraints determined by `NUM_TESTS` and across 32 channels. It writes randomly generated data into the system for testing, and does a series of checks to verify data integrity. In the outer loop, the block cycles through numerous test iterations. Inside the second loop, it generates random input data and writes to various channels, then also checks frame synchronization on the first test of the first channel. It captures data out for each bit of data out in the reverse clock edge. It finally checks each output data against the input data, and if there are any mismatches, an error message is displayed, and the test stops if `ERRORSTOP` is enabled."
