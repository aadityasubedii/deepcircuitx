    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module acts as a testbench for the ACCUM module, verifying its operation using an array of input and output ports including clk, reset, scan inputs, scan_enable, test_mode, and W. It uses both external inputs and internal signals (W, S, and scan outputs) for data procession and test paths. The module's code is split between initialization of time formats and input signals, clock signal generation, and incorporating the ACCUM module. SDF annotations and clock signals are managed using the CLK_PERIOD macro."
