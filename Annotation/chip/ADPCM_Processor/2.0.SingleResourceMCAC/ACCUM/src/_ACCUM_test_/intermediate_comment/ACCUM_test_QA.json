The 'test' module includes signals like clock (clk), reset, test_mode and scan signals scan_in, scan_enable as inputs to ACCUM, and scan_out signals as outputs from ACCUM. It uses the macro CLK_PERIOD for generating clock signal. It also includes the possibility to use sdf (Standard Delay Format) annotations during simulations."
