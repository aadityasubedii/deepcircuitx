The inputs are a 16-bit value W and a control signal clear. The computed sum is stored in the 16-bit register S. The module is sensitive to a clock signal and a reset signal, Upon a high reset signal, register S is reset to 0. The clear signal can also reset the register to 0. If neither reset nor clear signals are high, the new value of S will be the sum of current S and W. The scan inputs and outputs typically suggest it may be used for a scan-chain in a test configuration."
