    "module": "Module-level comment: The ACCUM module is an accumulator adding a 16-bit input `W` to the current accumulator value `S`, unless either control signal `reset` or `clear` is high, resetting `S` to 0. The operations are driven by a system clock signal `clk`. Five scan input signals and a scan enable signal support testing configurations. Outputs include the updated accumulator value `S` and five scan output signals. This functionality is achieved within a single always block in the module, making it sensitive to rising edges of the `clk` or `reset` signals."
