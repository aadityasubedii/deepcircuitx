Module name: ACCUM.

Module specification: The ACCUM module is an accumulator, primarily performing the function of addition. It takes as input a 16-bit value (`W`), a system clock (`clk`), two control signals (`reset` and `clear`), a test mode signal (`test_mode`), a scan enable signal (`scan_enable`), and five scan input signals (`scan_in0`, `scan_in1`, `scan_in2`, `scan_in3`, `scan_in4`). The ACCUM module is clock-sensitive and uses the clock to drive its operations. When the `reset` signal is high, it resets the value in the accumulator `S` to 0; likewise, when the `clear` signal is high. If neither `reset` nor `clear` signals are high, the new value of `S` will be the sum of `W` and the current value in `S`. The `test_mode` and `scan_enable` switch the module between normal and test configurations, while the scan input signals are typically used in testing scenarios to load and propagate sequential state. The output of this module consists of the new accumulator value `S` and five scan output signals (`scan_out0`, `scan_out1`, `scan_out2`, `scan_out3`, `scan_out4`) which are used in testing scenarios for observing and propagating the sequential state. Internally, the module uses the accumulator `S` to store the computed sum. It uses a single always block which controls the behavior of this accumulator based on the input signals. Upon a high `reset` or `clear` signal, the `S` register is reset to 0; otherwise, the new value of `S` is computed as the sum of its current value and `W`.
