Comment: 
This block of code implements a synchronous resettable and clearable accumulator in a digital system. When a rising edge is detected on the 'reset' or 'clear' signal line, the register 'S' is reset to zero. If neither reset nor clear signals are detected, the value in register 'S' incrementally adds the value in 'W' at each positive cycle of the clock 'clk'.
