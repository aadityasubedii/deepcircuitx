    "block_comment": "This block of code is for clock signal generation in simulations. The `always` keyword is used to produce a continuous clock signal with a period defined by `CLK_PERIOD` in the simulation environment. Specifically, the clock signal 'clk' is toggled every half a clock period (`CLK_PERIOD/2`), which effectively creates a square wave clock signal necessary for a digital system simulation."
