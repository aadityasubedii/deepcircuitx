    "module": "Module-level comment: 'wishbone_arbiter' is a bus arbitration module in a digital system utilizing the Wishbone protocol. By processing master's signals ('i_m0_wb_*') and 10 sets of slave signals ('i_s*_wb_*'), it directs communication requests from slaves to the master. The module determines the 'current_slave' based on the master's address and assigns control and data signals between the master and the chosen slave. It ensures proper synchronization and data integrity across hardware modules by outputting 'o_m0_wb_dat', 'o_m0_wb_ack', and 'o_m0_wb_err' from the master and 'o_s*_wb_*' signals to the respective slave.\n"
