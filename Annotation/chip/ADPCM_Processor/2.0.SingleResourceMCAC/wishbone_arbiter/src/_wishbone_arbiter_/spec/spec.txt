Module name: wishbone_arbiter. 

Module specification: The 'wishbone_arbiter' is a Verilog module operating as a bus arbiter in digital systems, responsible for managing communication requests from various slave modules to the master module using Wishbone protocol. The key input ports include 'reset', 'clk', and a set of 'i_m0_wb_*' (like i_m0_wb_adr, i_m0_wb_sel, i_m0_wb_we, etc.) representing address, select signal, write enable, data, cycle valid, and strobe signals from master. Additionally, it receives 'i_s*_wb_*' (like i_s0_wb_dat, i_s0_wb_ack, i_s0_wb_err, etc.) inputs for each slave module ranging from 'i_s0' to 'i_s9', representing data, acknowledgement, and error signals from slaves. The output ports mainly include 'o_s*_wb_*' (such as o_s0_wb_adr, o_s0_wb_dat, o_s0_wb_sel, o_s0_wb_we, etc.) for each slave module from 'o_s0' to 'o_s9', representing the data and control signals directed to the slave modules. It also provides 'o_m0_wb_dat', 'o_m0_wb_ack', and 'o_m0_wb_err' as outputs from master, representing data read by master, and the acknowledgement and error signals from the currently served slave. The internal signals 'current_slave', 'master_*' manage the arbitration protocol by storing the current served slave, holding the master's signals, and assigning these values to the necessary slave as per 'current_slave'. The module works by determining the 'current_slave' based on the master's address, and performing the necessary data exchange between the master and that slave, ensuring proper synchronization and data integrity among multiple hardware modules in a system.
