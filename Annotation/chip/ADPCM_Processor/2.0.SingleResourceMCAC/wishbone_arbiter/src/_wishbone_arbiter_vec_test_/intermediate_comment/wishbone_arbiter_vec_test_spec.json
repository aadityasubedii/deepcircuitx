    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the 'wishbone_arbiter' module. It is primarily used for verifying the 'wishbone_arbiter' function under various conditions, including scanning and testing modes. The input ports 'clk', 'reset', and 'test_mode' control the synchronizing clock signal, the resetting to an initial state of the system, and switching between operation and test modes respectively. It also includes input scan signals 'scan_in[0:4]' and 'scan_enable' which allow for reading the internal state of the 'wishbone_arbiter', particularly useful during testing and debugging stages. \n\nThe output scan signals 'scan_out[0:4]' are used for reading the 'wishbone_arbiter' state and confirming it is reaching all expected states during the scan test mode. Internal signals such as 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in[0:4]', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' between the 'test' module and the 'wishbone_arbiter' module, are wired to facilitate interaction between these modules during the testing phase.\n\nThis code consists of different blocks; primarily the wishbone_arbiter block, for which the parameters are set within an initial block. The initial block sets the state of internal wires like reset, clock and scan-enable signals, which are vital for simulation. Also noteworthy is the presence of a conditional annotation made possible by the SDFSCAN flag; when defined, SDF (Standard Delay Format) information for timing simulation gets annotated for the 'wishbone_arbiter'. The 'test' module primarily sets up the environment to perform tests and scanning on the 'wishbone_arbiter' module.",

The 'wishbone_arbiter' is designed to handle multiple signals in a scan or test mode. The module initializes the variables as 0 and then finishes execution, it is not implementing a full test, but it appears to be written as a framework for a testbench.

Explanation: As it's a synchronous system, it needs a clock signal to determine when exactly the changes in the system occur. This controls the overall functioning of the test module.\n2. reset: This is the reset signal for the test module. Explanation: The reset signal is usually used to bring the system to a known initial state. This can be used in simulation to set all values to defined states and start from a clean slate.\n3. scan_in[0:4]: These are the input scan signals to the 'wishbone_arbiter' module. Explanation: Scan signals are usually used in test modes for verifying that digital logic produces the expected output. They allow for checking each internal state of the module under test, in this case, the wishbone_arbiter.\n4. scan_enable: This is the enable signal for the scan mode. Explanation: When this control signal is high, it enables the functional blocks inside the wishbone_arbiter to enter into the scan mode.\n5. test_mode: This is the test mode signal. Explanation: This signal decides if the circuit is operating in its functional mode or test mode (such as scan mode). \n\nOutput Ports:\n1. scan_out[0:4]: These are the output scan signals from the 'wishbone_arbiter' module.
