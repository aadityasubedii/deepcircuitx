Module name: test. 

Module specification: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the 'wishbone_arbiter' module. It is primarily used for verifying the 'wishbone_arbiter' function under various conditions, including scanning and testing modes. The input ports 'clk', 'reset', and 'test_mode' control the synchronizing clock signal, the resetting to an initial state of the system, and switching between operation and test modes respectively. It also includes input scan signals 'scan_in[0:4]' and 'scan_enable' which allow for reading the internal state of the 'wishbone_arbiter', particularly useful during testing and debugging stages. 

The output scan signals 'scan_out[0:4]' are used for reading the 'wishbone_arbiter' state and confirming it is reaching all expected states during the scan test mode. Internal signals such as 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in[0:4]', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' between the 'test' module and the 'wishbone_arbiter' module, are wired to facilitate interaction between these modules during the testing phase.

This code consists of different blocks; primarily the wishbone_arbiter block, for which the parameters are set within an initial block. The initial block sets the state of internal wires like reset, clock and scan-enable signals, which are vital for simulation. Also noteworthy is the presence of a conditional annotation made possible by the SDFSCAN flag; when defined, SDF (Standard Delay Format) information for timing simulation gets annotated for the 'wishbone_arbiter'. The 'test' module primarily sets up the environment to perform tests and scanning on the 'wishbone_arbiter' module.
