Module-level comment: // The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the 'wishbone_arbiter' module. It uses a clock signal 'clk' and 'reset' signal to synchronize and reset the module. Further, it utilizes 'scan_in[0:4]' signals in conjunction with 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' signals for various testing modes. The output 'scan_out[0:4]' signals reflect 'wishbone_arbiter's' internal states during test modes. The initial block sets the initial system state, and if the 'SDFSCAN' flag is enabled, SDF annotation for timing simulation is implemented. It mainly paves a way for simulation and testing of 'wishbone_arbiter' module.
