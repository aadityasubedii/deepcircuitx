Given the current understanding, where the provided Verilog code snippet only contains the `timescale directive, a comprehensive module-level comment cannot be generated accurately. The `timescale directive is not a module, but instead specifies the time units and precision for the simulator.

However, if we were to consider a hypothetical module (for illustration purposes), let's say a multiply module as described earlier, a relevant module-level comment would look like this:

Module-level comment:
```
// Module: multiply
// This module performs an unsigned multiplication operation 
// between input port 'a' and 'b', both integers of width 'WIDTH'.
// The result, 'y', is an unsigned integer of double the width
// of the inputs given by 'a*b'.
```

Is there a particular module you had in mind that you'd like to generate comments for? If you provide more specific information (like the complete Verilog module), I can help you better.
