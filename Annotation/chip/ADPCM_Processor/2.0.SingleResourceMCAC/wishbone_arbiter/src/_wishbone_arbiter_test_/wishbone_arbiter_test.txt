/*
This testbench verifies a Wishbone bus arbiter by simulating transactions between a master and 10 slaves. It generates random data and addresses, applies them to the arbiter, and checks for correct signal routing, address decoding, data transfer, and error handling. The testbench iterates through all slave interfaces, applying and verifying transactions to ensure proper arbiter functionality across different address ranges and slave configurations.
