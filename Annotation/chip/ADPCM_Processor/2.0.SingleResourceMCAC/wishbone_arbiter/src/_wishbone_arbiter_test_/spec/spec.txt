Module name: test. Module specification: This module is a testbench for a Wishbone bus arbiter, named "wishbone_arbiter". It simulates and verifies the functionality of the arbiter by generating test scenarios for a single master and ten slaves. The module includes input ports for clock, reset, scan chains, and Wishbone signals from the master and slaves. Output ports include scan chain outputs and Wishbone signals to the slaves and master. Internal signals are used for temporary storage and comparison during testing. The testbench is structured with an initial block that sets up the test environment, applies reset, and then runs a series of tests for each slave interface. It generates random data and address values, applies them to the arbiter, and verifies the correct routing of signals between the master and the appropriate slave. The module checks for proper address decoding, data transfer, acknowledgment, and error signaling across all slave interfaces. It uses parameters to
