    "module": "Module-level comment: This main_mem module acts as a placeholder for future implementation in Verilog. It includes input ports for reset, clock, scanning inputs, enabling scanning and test mode implying a testing/debugging mechanism. It also has corresponding scanning output ports for debugging data. Presently, without any internal signals or logic, its functionality relies on future work. Future modifications will define the specific behaviors and implementations."
