    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module is primarily designed for scan testing of a digital circuit. This module declares input wires 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode', and output wires 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4'. The 'reset' input is used to reset all the internal state of the module, while 'clk' works as the system clock. The inputs 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', controlled by 'scan_enable', are used for feeding test patterns into the circuit during scan testing. 'test_mode' specifies whether the module is operating in test mode or not. The output wires 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' are used to observe the circuit's responses to the test patterns. \n\nInternally, the module calls the 'main_mem' module, passing all its inputs and outputs accordingly. There's an initial block that initializes the time format and applies Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotation if SDFSCAN is defined. It then initializes the internal signals 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' to binary zero, marking the end of execution. \n\nThis module ensures that individual module functionalities are tested and verified, increasing the chip's reliability before its deployment. Scan testing, as done here, is a structural testing technique used to discover manufacturing defects in digital circuits effectively.",

They are used in scan testing to set the register states to specific test values for better control over the circuit and to improve test coverage.\n- 'scan_enable' is an internal signal used to control the transition of the system between normal function mode and test mode.
