    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves to perform scan testing on digital circuits. It uses 'scan_in' inputs to input test patterns controlled by 'scan_enable'. After a reset, responses are observed on 'scan_out' ports under a system clock 'clk'. It relies on the 'main_mem' submodule, Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotations under 'SDFSCAN' define, and initializes signals to zero. This module provides an effective way to test and verify individual module functionalities."
