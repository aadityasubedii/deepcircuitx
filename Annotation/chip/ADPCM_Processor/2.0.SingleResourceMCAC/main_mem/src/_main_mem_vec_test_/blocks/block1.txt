Comment: 
This block of Verilog code sets the initial conditions for a simulation environment and formats the display of simulation time. When the Standard Delay Format (SDF) scanning is enabled, this block applies a specific SDF file "sdf/main_mem_tsmc18_scan.sdf" to a top-level design "test.top". The code then initializes the clock, reset, test mode, scan enable, and scan input signals to '0', which essentially clears and prepares the system for a new simulation. At the end, the simulation finishes using the "$finish" command.
