Module name: test.

Module specification: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for another module, namely 'main_mem', simulating various inputs and configurations for it. It includes two main sections: the definition of the 'main_mem' instance and the initialization block. The module has eight input ports comprising of 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0-4', 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode'. The 'clk' and 'reset' ports are considered to be control signals, where 'clk' orchestrates actions within the module and 'reset' resets the 'main_mem' module to its initial state. The rest of the input ports, 'scan_in0-4', 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode', are mainly used to control the state of the module during testing. Likewise, it has five output ports, namely 'scan_out0-4' that are used to observe the internal state of 'main_mem'. These ports are primarily used for outputs resulting from chain scans during testing processes. Internal signals correspond to the input ports and they are responsible for dictating the clock timing, enabling and controlling the various testing modes, and resetting the 'main_mem' module among others.  Finally, the 'initial' block in the code is used to define the time format, initial state of the control signals and SDF annotation (if SDFSCAN is defined), followed by the termination of the simulation. Hence, this module plays a crucial role in verifying the operation of the 'main_mem' module by controlling and observing its various states.
