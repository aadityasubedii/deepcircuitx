    "block_comment": "This block initializes the simulation environment and sets up test conditions. In the beginning of the simulation, it sets the time format to \"ns\". If the mode for scanning SDF files is defined, it would annotate the test circuit with timing information. Following this, all the signals: 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0', 'scan_in1', 'scan_in2', 'scan_in3', 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', 'test_mode' are set to low ('0'). Once the setup is completed, the '$finish' command is called to end the simulation."
