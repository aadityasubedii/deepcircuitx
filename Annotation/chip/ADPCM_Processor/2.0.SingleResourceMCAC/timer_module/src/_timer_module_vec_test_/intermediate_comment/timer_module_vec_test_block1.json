    "block_comment": "This block of code sets the initial conditions for a Verilog simulation. It first prepares the time format for the simulation then, if the `SDFSCAN` directive is available, it will annotate the design with delay information using a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file. Subsequent lines then initialize the states of several simulation parameters such as clk, reset, various scan inputs, scan_enable, and test_mode to low (0). The block's process ends by including a $finish command to conclude the initialization."
