    "module": "Module-level comment: Test is a simulated test bench module for the `timer_module`, initializing all input signals to their default states at the start of simulation. Comprising two main blocks, it begins with instantiation of the `timer_module` with appropriately mapped I/O ports, followed by an initial block to define initial state-settings for all ports with conditional Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotation. However, it concludes immediately post initialization, not running any specific test cases. The Test module assists in setting up an environment for the `timer_module` under test."
