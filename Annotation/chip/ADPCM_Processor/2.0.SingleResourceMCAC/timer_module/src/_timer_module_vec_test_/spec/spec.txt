Module name: Test. 

Module specification: The Test module serves as the primary testing module for the `timer_module`, providing default initializations to a set of signals at the onset of a simulation run. At the input, the module introduces a set of nine ports, primarily the system clock 'clk', 'reset' signal, 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' for inputting test data, 'scan_enable' to initiate a scan test, and 'test_mode' to toggle between normal or test operational modes. At the output, the module introduces ports 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' to relay the results of any executed scan test. Besides, the module has internal signals identical to the input ports, orchestrating synchronous operations within the module. The Test module is structured into two blocks; the first block instantiates the `timer_module` with input and output ports mapped, and the second block defines the initial state settings for all ports along with optional Standard Delay Format (SDF) file annotation provision. However, this module does not execute any test cases but ends post-port initialization.
