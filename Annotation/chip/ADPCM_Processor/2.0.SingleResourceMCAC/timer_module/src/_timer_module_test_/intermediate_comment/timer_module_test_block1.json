    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes a test environment for a digital system. It sets the time format for simulation, optionally annotates a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file when the `SDFSCAN` macro is defined, and initalizes clock and test-mode related signals to `0` before ending the simulation."
