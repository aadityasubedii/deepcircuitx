    "module": "Module-level comment: This 'test' module serves as a test bench for 'timer_module', setting and driving its multiple signals like 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in' inputs, 'scan_enable', 'test_mode' and 'scan_out' outputs. It consists of an initial block setting up time format, optional SDF timing and initializing registers. Note: Simulation ends right after initialization, indicating possible incompleteness of the code."
