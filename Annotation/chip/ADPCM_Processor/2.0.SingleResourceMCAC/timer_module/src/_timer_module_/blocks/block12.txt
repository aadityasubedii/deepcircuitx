This block of Verilog code implements a register for controlling start read operations on a wishbone bus interface. At every positive edge of the system clock (`clk`), or in case of a reset signal (`reset`), the register`wb_start_read_d1` gets updated. If a reset signal is received, it sets the `wb_start_read_d1` to zero. Otherwise, the register `wb_start_read_d1` will follow the signal from `wb_start_read` at the next clock cycle. This approach is crucial for synchronizing data transfers and controlling the state of read operations in a wishbone bus interconnection system.
