Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for controlling the `timer1_int_reg` register based on conditions. Initially, it checks if a write operation is requested and targeted at the `AMBER_TM_TIMER1_CLR` address. If these conditions are met, the `timer1_int_reg` register is cleared by assigning it a 0. If not, it checks a secondary condition where `timer1_value_reg` is equal to zero, without performing an action in this case.
