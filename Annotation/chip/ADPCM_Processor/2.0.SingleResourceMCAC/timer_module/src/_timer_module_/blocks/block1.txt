Comment: 
This block of Verilog code serves as an interrupt controller for a system with three timers. By executing operations synchronously with the system clock (clk) and following a logic to reset states or handle interrupts based on timer status. If a reset signal is received, it resets the register values associated with the timer interrupts to zero. Otherwise, current register values are sampled, and if any timer registers have had their interrupt status enabled since the last clock cycle without being previously detected, it triggers a debug message indicating an interrupt for the corresponding timer module.
