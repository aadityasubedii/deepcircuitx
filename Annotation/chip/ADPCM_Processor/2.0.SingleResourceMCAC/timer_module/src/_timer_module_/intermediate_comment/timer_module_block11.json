    "block_comment": "This line of code in Verilog RTL design assigns a constant value to an output signal. More specifically, the `assign` keyword is used to continuously assign a value of `1'd0` (which represents a 1-bit decimal value 0) to the output wire signal `o_wb_err`. This effectively means that the `o_wb_err` is always set to 0, implying that an error condition related to this signal does not exist or is not detected."
