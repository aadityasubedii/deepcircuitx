It uses the wishbone bus for interfacing i.e., taking input data and outputting data, providing synchronization services. The module allows setting a loading value for the timers, clearing the timers, and also provides interrupt signals when each timer counts down to zero. The module also interfaces with some sort of external debug system, which might be used for troubleshooting and validation."
