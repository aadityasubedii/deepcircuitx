    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code implements a synchronously resettable timer with three timer register groups: \"timer0\", \"timer1\", and \"timer2\". Each timer group maintains its load, value, control, and interrupt registers. On reset, all registers are set to default values. When a write signal is received, the code checks the address to decide which register within a timer group to write into. Each timer counts down based on its control register's prescale value, and if it reaches zero, it either reloads from the load register, depending on the load register's control bit, or sets itself to be the maximum value. The interrupt register for each timer is set to indicate a complete timer countdown. The block allows timer configuration and value updates as specified by write requests with specific addresses, making it adaptable in a larger system context."
