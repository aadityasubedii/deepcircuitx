    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning interrupt flags from three timer registers to an output vector, `o_timer_int`. Specifically, these bits are formed by the flags available in the `timer2_int_reg`, `timer1_int_reg`, and `timer0_int_reg` registers. This structure is used to consolidate and organize individual timer interrupt flags into one manageable vector, streamlining the process of interrupt handling and prioritization."
