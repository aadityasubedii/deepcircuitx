    "block_comment": "This block handles the condition for a Write-Back (WB) operation to the Timer2 Clear register. When a WB operation begins and the address matches that of the Timer2 Clear register, the interrupt register for Timer2 is cleared. Alternatively, if the value of Timer2 reaches zero, the block also handles this scenario and does not clarify specific actions which will depend on subsequent blocks of code. This implementation is a straightforward conditional execution operation, hence it directly modifies or inspects Timer2 according to the conditions set."
