    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for generating an acknowledgment signal for a Wishbone bus transaction. It accomplishes this task by using an 'assign' statement to create combinational logic. The signal 'o_wb_ack' goes high whenever strobe input 'i_wb_stb' is asserted and either a wishbone write cycle 'wb_start_write' or a delayed read cycle 'wb_start_read_d1' is initiated."
