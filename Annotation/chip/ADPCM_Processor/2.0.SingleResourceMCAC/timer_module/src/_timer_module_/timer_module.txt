Module-level comment: The 'timer_module' is a customizable FPGA/ASIC system timer facilitating three individual countdown timers, interfaced via a Wishbone bus. Each timer possesses a loadable counter, control modes, and interrupt generation on reaching zero. The module utilizes internal registers for timer control and value tracking. Communication with the Wishbone bus directs write/read operations, controlled by wire signals. Debugging and test modes with a scan chain are incorporated for validation. The design works with diverse bus sizes, ensured by a conditional generation structure.
