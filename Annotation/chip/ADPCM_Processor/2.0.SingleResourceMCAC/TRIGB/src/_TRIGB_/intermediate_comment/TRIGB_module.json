    "module": "Module-level comment: The TRIGB module serves as a part of a testing or scanning mechanism, driven by reset and clk inputs. It incorporates an 'always' block that monitors AnP and TR inputs. If TR equals 0, AnP value is passed directly to output 'AnR', otherwise, 'AnR' is set to 0. Also, it provides unspecified 'scan_in' and 'scan_out' functionality, with switching managed by 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' inputs."
