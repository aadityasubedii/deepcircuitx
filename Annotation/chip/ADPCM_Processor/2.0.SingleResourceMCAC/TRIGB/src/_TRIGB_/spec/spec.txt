Module name: TRIGB. 
Module specification: The TRIGB module appears to be designed for a testing or scanning mechanism in a digital hardware design. It operates synchronously, driven by a clock and a reset signal. The inputs to the module include reset, clk, scan_in0, scan_in1, scan_in2, scan_in3, scan_in4, scan_enable, test_mode, TR and AnP. The reset and clk input signals are typically used in digital circuits for synchronization. 'scan_in' and 'scan_enable' inputs are indicative of a scan or test process, and 'test_mode' might be used to switch between normal and test modes. The input 'TR' seems to be a signal used for testing purposes, while 'AnP' is a 16-bit input that is passed through to the output 'AnR'. The outputs of the module include scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4 and AnR. 'scan_out' signals could be the result of the scan or test process, although itâ€™s unclear from the provided code. AnR is a 16-bit output, which is regulated by the input TR, either carrying the value of AnP (if TR=0) or being set to 0. The module employs an always block that monitors the AnP and TR inputs and conditionally assigns the value of AnP to AnR, providing a pass-through or reset functionality.
