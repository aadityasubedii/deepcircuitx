This block responds to changes in the `AnP` and `TR` signals. If `TR` is 0, the block will assign the value of `AnP` to `AnR`. Otherwise, it sets `AnR` to 0. The operation of assigning `AnR` depends on the value of `TR`, hence making `TR` a control signal for this block, while `AnP` provides the input data.
