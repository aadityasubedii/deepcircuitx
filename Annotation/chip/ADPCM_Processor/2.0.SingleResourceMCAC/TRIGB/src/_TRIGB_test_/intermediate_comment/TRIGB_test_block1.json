    "block_comment": "This block primarily sets up the testbench environment for verification purposes. It begins by setting the 'timeformat' to represent simulation time in nanoseconds and later initializes the clock (clk), reset, test input (scan_in0 to scan_in4), scan enable, and test_mode signals to a default value of 0. If the macro 'SDFSCAN' is defined, it applies SDF annotation for delay information based on a specific file. The block concludes by calling the '$finish' system task to stop the simulation after the initial block execution."
