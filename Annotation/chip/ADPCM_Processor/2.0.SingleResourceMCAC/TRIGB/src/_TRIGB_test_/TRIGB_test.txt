Module-level comment: This 'test' module acts as a testbench for the TRIGB module, generating scan chain features for IC testing and configuring clock and control signals. TRIGB is instantiated with the defined inputs for functionality testing. Clock signal is toggled at each half of 'CLK_PERIOD'. All signals get initialized to default states while SDF annotation for TRIGB is included conditionally. The simulation ends once initialization completes.
