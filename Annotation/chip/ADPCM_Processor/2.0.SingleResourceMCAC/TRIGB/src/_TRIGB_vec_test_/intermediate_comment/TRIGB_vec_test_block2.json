    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for generating a clock signal. It uses a preprocessor macro named `CLK_PERIOD`, which represents the total period of the clock cycle. The period divided by two gives the duration of either the high or low pulse of the clock signal. The signal is toggled every half-period intervals, thus executing `clk = ~clk;` which is equivalent to flipping the clock state at every time step to simulate the behavior of a perfect square wave clock signal."
