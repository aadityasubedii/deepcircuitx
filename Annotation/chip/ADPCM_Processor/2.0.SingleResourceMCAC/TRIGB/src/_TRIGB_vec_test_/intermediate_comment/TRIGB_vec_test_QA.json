It uses different configurations of parameters including rates, laws, operations, types, and models, and reads specific files derived from these configurations using the '$readmemh' function. For these configurations, it tests the behaviour of the module 'TRIGB' by comparing its output with expected results, displaying errors if the output diverges from what's expected. It basically carries out exhaustive testing, labeling each test iteration with its respective parameters. It also has provisions to print additional details if verbose mode is enabled, and the ability to stop on encountering errors if it's defined."
