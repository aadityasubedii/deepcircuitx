    "spec": "Module name: test\n\nModule Specification:\n\nThe \"test\" module serves as a comprehensive testbench for the 'TRIGB' module. It uses an exhaustive testing approach to examine the behaviour of the 'TRIGB' module under different configurations of rates, laws, operations, types, and models. \n\nThe module consists of several input ports such as clock (clk), reset, scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), scan mode enable (scan_enable), test mode (test_mode), and test vectors (TR, AnP). The clock synchronizes all operations in the module while the reset signal halts all current operations. The scan inputs and scan_enable are used to implement Scan Testing, a common hardware testing methodology, while the test_mode puts the module into test mode. Test vectors are read from files and applied as a part of the testing process to 'TRIGB'.\n\nOutput ports include the scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and AnR. The scan outputs are used in the Scan testing methodology, whereas AnR is the output of 'TRIGB' which is compared with expected results to ascertain if the operation of 'TRIGB' is as expected.\n\nInternally, the module employs various signals like rates, laws, operations, types, models (to set up different test conditions), rate, law, operation, type, model, j, loop (used for iterators), TR, TRs, AnP, AnPs, AnR, AnRs (storing expected and actual responses for validation), vectorSizes (storing the size of the vectors used in testing), and clk (Providing timing for operations).\n\nThe 'test' module primarily consists of several sections such as initial configurations, clock operations, test case loaders, exhaustive tests, and the final section for completion. The initial configurations set the different rates, laws, operations, types, and models. The clock operation synchronizes the operations within the module. The test case loaders section reads in the pre-stored test vectors for different configurations. The exhaustive tests section runs an extensive list of test cases on the 'TRIGB' module for all the different configurations, comparing the output to the expected output and flagging an error if any discrepancy is found. The final section signals the completion of testing and terminates the operation of the module.",

                    "text": "Module name: test\n\nModule Specification:\n\nThe \"test\" module serves as a comprehensive testbench for the 'TRIGB' module. It uses an exhaustive testing approach to examine the behaviour of the 'TRIGB' module under different configurations of rates, laws, operations, types, and models. \n\nThe module consists of several input ports such as clock (clk), reset, scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), scan mode enable (scan_enable), test mode (test_mode), and test vectors (TR, AnP). The clock synchronizes all operations in the module while the reset signal halts all current operations. The scan inputs and scan_enable are used to implement Scan Testing, a common hardware testing methodology, while the test_mode puts the module into test mode. Test vectors are read from files and applied as a part of the testing process to 'TRIGB'.\n\nOutput ports include the scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and AnR. The scan outputs are used in the Scan testing methodology, whereas AnR is the output of 'TRIGB' which is compared with expected results to ascertain if the operation of 'TRIGB' is as expected.\n\nInternally, the module employs various signals like rates, laws, operations, types, models (to set up different test conditions), rate, law, operation, type, model, j, loop (used for iterators), TR, TRs, AnP, AnPs, AnR, AnRs (storing expected and actual responses for validation), vectorSizes (storing the size of the vectors used in testing), and clk (Providing timing for operations).\n\nThe 'test' module primarily consists of several sections such as initial configurations, clock operations, test case loaders, exhaustive tests, and the final section for completion. The initial configurations set the different rates, laws, operations, types, and models. The clock operation synchronizes the operations within the module. The test case loaders section reads in the pre-stored test vectors for different configurations. The exhaustive tests section runs an extensive list of test cases on the 'TRIGB' module for all the different configurations, comparing the output to the expected output and flagging an error if any discrepancy is found. The final section signals the completion of testing and terminates the operation of the module."
