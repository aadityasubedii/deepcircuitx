    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module is a testbench for the 'TRIGB' module, examining its behaviour under various rate, law, operation, type, and model configurations. It utilizes scan inputs/outputs and a clock for synchronization and scan testing. Internal registers store different test configurations and compare output from 'TRIGB' with expected results, flagging errors if differences are found. Tests are implemented within a series of nested loops that systematically vary configurations and apply the corresponding test vectors to 'TRIGB'."
