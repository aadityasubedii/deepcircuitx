    "module": "Apologies for the confusion, but the Verilog line you provided, \"`timescale 1ns / 1ps\", doesn't define a module. It's simply a directive that defines the time units and precision for a simulation. As such, it's not possible to generate a module-level comment based on this line alone. \n\nFor a module-level comment, we'd need to know the functionalities, purpose, implementation details, and structure of a specific Verilog module. If you could provide a complete Verilog module, I'd be happy to help generate the detailed module-level comment for that."
