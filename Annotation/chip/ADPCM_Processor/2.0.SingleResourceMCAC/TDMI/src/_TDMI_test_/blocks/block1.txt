Comment: 
This block performs the process of strobing a read operation on a Wishbone bus. When a positive clock edge is detected, the block assigns the test address to the Wishbone bus address, initiates the cycle ('i_wb_cyc'), and asserts the strobe signal ('i_wb_stb') for a read operation by setting 'i_wb_we' to 0. After acknowledgment ('o_wb_ack') from the bus, it de-asserts the cycle and strobe signals on the next clock edge. If the returned data ('o_wb_dat') does not match the expected ('truth_data_test'), it logs an error message and stops execution if 'ERRORSTOP' is defined.
