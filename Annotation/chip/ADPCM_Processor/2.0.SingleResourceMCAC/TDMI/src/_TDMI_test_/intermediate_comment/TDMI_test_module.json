    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module is a rigorous testbench for the 'TDMI' hardware module. It provides controlled simulation through various input signals and fetches results via output signals, including scan signals and Wishbone bus protocol signals. Internally, it generates clock signals, initializes signals, creates loop constructs for iterations of varied tests, and executes random test vector creation. Functionality verification involves a task 'wb_read_strobe', where output data is compared with expected results, printing error messages when discrepancies are detected."
