This testbench subscribes to the TDMI module with various inputs and outputs. The module sets clock signals, initializes registers and inputs to the TDMI module, stimulates the TDMI module with randomized input sequences, checks the functionality by comparing the output to expected results, and prints out error messages when the output and the expected results do not match. It conducts the test repeatedly for different addresses and for multiple channels."
