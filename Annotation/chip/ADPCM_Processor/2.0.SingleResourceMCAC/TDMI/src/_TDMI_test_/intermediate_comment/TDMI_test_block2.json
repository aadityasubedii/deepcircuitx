    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily prepares for and executes test sequences on the design under test (DUT). To establish the testing environment, it initialises certain variables, specifies the time format, and includes optional SDF annotation to enable detailed timing analysis. The procedures for the test are then carried out. This involves switching the reset signal at the clock's positive and negative edge, setting up Wishbone signals, and issuing a series of signals in nested loops to simulate the full range of possible input conditions. After executing all addresses in `NUM_ADDRESSES`, and applying different clock cycles per address, the test concludes with a 'TEST COMPLETE' message and a simulation termination command."
