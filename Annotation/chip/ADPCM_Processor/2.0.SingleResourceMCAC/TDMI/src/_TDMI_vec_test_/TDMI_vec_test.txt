Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the TDMI module, initialising relevant signals to '0' and driving input ports - clk, reset, scan_in*, scan_enable, and test_mode to generate scan_out* outputs. Using internal signals matching inputs, it connects elements, facilitates operation and testing modes, further enabling SDF annotation for timing simulations conditionally with `ifdef`. It ensures accurate operation of the parent TDMI module.
