    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for initial configuration and setting of simulation parameters. Primarily, it sets the precision of the simulation time to nanoseconds (ns) and then specifies into which component to import the Standard Delay Format (SDF) if SDFSCAN is defined. Subsequently, it initializes all scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), clock (clk), reset, scan_enable, and test_mode signal to 0. After setting all these parameters, it ends the simulation process using the $finish command."
