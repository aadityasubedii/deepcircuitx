    "spec": "Module name: test.\n\nModule specification: The 'test' module is designed for the purpose of testing the functionality of the TDMI (a custom designed Digital Module Interface). It plays a role in driving input signals into the TDMI so as to generate outputs for testing. The module acts as a test bench, initializing all inputs to '0' at the beginning. It uses a variety of input ports that are driven by it - clk (the clock signal for synchronization), reset (to restore all registers to their initial state), scan_in0 through scan_in4 (the scan test inputs used for diagnostic tests), scan_enable (the signal that enables scan mode), and test_mode (the signal that toggles between test and normal operational modes). \n\nCorrespondingly, the output ports are scan_out0 through scan_out4, which serve to provide the outputs for the scan test inputs. Internally, signals, identical to the input ports, are used to interconnect elements and transfer information through the module. \n\nThe code can be categorized broadly into three sections: declaration of input-output and internal variables, instantiation of the TDMI module and connecting signals, and an initial block that sets initial conditions. An important feature is that there is possible SDF (Standard Delay Format) annotation included for simulating timing delays, but this is conditionally compiled based on the macro `ifdef`. The purpose of the entire module is to facilitate testing and ensure accurate operation of the much larger TDMI module.",
