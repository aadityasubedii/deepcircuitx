Comment: 
This code block is a sequential logic operation that runs on every positive edge of the system clock or when reset is asserted. The block's main functions include data buffer manipulation, TDMI start control, and write enable operations. Resetting of all variables occurs when reset is high, setting them to their default values. In normal operation, the block uses 'tdmi_begin' to control the flow of operations, and buffer selection based on 'bit_count'. Buffer 2 is continually updated with buffer 1 data. Along with this, 'i_wb_stb' & 'i_wb_cyc' controls the read operation, where based on the address, 'o_wb_dat' is populated with the relevant information. Alternatively, if 'i_wb_we' is high, write operation is initiated to 'tdmi_begin', by 'i_wb_dat[0]'. In all other conditions, 'start_read' gets reset.
