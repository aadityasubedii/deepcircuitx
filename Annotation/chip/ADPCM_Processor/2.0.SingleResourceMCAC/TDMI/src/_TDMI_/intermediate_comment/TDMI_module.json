    "module": "Module-level comment: The TDMI module serves as a flexible serial data receiver, catering to the Test Data Input (TDI) in a JTAG interface. It receives and processes serial data, handling tasks of frame synchronization and data storage in system registers. The module uses multiple input and output ports for diverse control and data/status signal exchanges. Internally, various signals are handled for clocking, data and channel buffering, read triggering, and interrupt setting. The code is partitioned into initializing, clock buffering, data/channel buffering, read/write operations, and error handling segments for efficient functionality."
