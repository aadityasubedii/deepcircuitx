The module sets up the initial conditions for this unit by first defining the format for displaying simulation time, then it conditionally annotates standard delay format (SDF) data for back annotated gate level simulations. Finally, it initializes the inputs for the 'top' unit including the clock, reset, and several scan inputs. This module does not have an actual functionality beyond setting up the initial conditions for the underlying interrupt controller and terminating the operation."
