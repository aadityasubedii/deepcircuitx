Comment: 
This block handles the reading of various interrupt control registers in a system. When a read is started (`wb_start_read`), based on the given address (`i_wb_adr`), it loads the 32-bit read data (`wb_rdata32`) with the contents of the specified register such as enable registers, status registers, raw interrupt registers and software triggered interrupt registers. If the system is reset, it initializes the read data to 0. If an unrecognized address is given, it defaults to loading the read data with '22334455' in hexadecimal format.
