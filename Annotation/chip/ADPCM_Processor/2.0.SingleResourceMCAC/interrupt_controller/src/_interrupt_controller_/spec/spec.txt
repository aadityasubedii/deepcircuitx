Module name: interrupt_controller. 

Module specification: The `interrupt_controller` module is a hardware component dedicated to the management of various interrupts within a system. The core functionality of the module involves handling raw interrupts originating from different sources such as UART, timer, and other test registers. Ultimately, it defines how these interrupt signals are processed. The controller has data width (WB_DWIDTH) and select width (WB_SWIDTH) as defining parameters. 

The module has several inputs and outputs. The inputs include system clock (clk), reset signal (reset), scan inputs (scan_in0-4), scan enable (scan_enable), test mode (test_mode), Wishbone B4 SoC communication signals (i_wb_adr, i_wb_sel, i_wb_we, i_wb_dat, i_wb_cyc, i_wb_stb), UART interrupt signal (i_uart0_int), test interrupt signals (i_test_reg_irq, i_test_reg_firq), timer interrupt signals (i_tm_timer_int), and a test debug module interface interrupt signal (i_tdmi_int). The outputs include scan outputs (scan_out0-4), Wishbone B4 interface signals (o_wb_dat, o_wb_ack, o_wb_err), interrupt request and fast interrupt request signals (o_irq, o_firq). 

The module uses internal signals to handle the enabling/disabling of interrupt handling, representing the interrupt lines (raw_interrupts, irq* and firq*), summarizing interrupt states and Wishbone bus operations (wb_rdata32, wb_start_write, wb_start_read, wb_start_read_d1, wb_wdata32). 

The code is divided into several sections. The first section defines the input and output ports and parameters. The next section is dedicated to the declaration of internal signals for interrupt handling. The following sections contain assignments for bus operation signals and interrupt signals, logic for interrupt enable/disable registers, logic for the read data from the interface and finally, there is a debugging section that is active when the AMBER_IC_DEBUG flag is set and provides detailed debug information by writing to simulation console. This provides a great tool for tracing the module's operation, particularly useful for the verification process. Overall, the module provides a comprehensive and focused interrupt handling solution for complex hardware systems.
