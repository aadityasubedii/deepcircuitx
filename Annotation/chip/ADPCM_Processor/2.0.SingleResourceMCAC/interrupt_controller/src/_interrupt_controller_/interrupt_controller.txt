Module-level comment: The `interrupt_controller` manages hardware interrupts from various sources such as UART, timers, and test registers, featuring inputs for system clock, reset, scan operations, testing modes, and Wishbone B4 SoC interface. It handles enabling/disabling interrupts and software interrupt registration using internal signals. It processes and qualifies interrupt signals, communicating interruptions to the CPU via output ports. It also handles reading/writing operations to the Wishbone bus and provides a debugging mode for detailed tracking of operations. The module's logic is organized into sections handling signal assignments, bus operations, and debugging.
