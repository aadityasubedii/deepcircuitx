    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for assigning interrupt signals to the `raw_interrupts` variable. This is achieved through the assign statement in Verilog, where distinct interrupt signals like `i_tdmi_int`, `i_tm_timer_int` (for the 0th, 1st, and 2nd indexes), and `i_uart0_int` are concatenated with several zeroes. The `23'd0` at the beginning denotes 23 zero bits, padded to meet the exact size needed for `raw_interrupts`."
