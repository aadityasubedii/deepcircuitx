    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for data writing and reading operations on a Wishbone interface. When the wishbone data width (WB_DWIDTH) is 128 bits, it segments the addressed data into 32-bit units and selects a corresponding segment based on the least significant two bits of the address (i_wb_adr). This selection is done through a conditional statement. Then, it replicates the read data four times for the output. In case the wishbone data width is not 128 bits, it simply assigns the data bus value to write data and the read data to the output bus."
