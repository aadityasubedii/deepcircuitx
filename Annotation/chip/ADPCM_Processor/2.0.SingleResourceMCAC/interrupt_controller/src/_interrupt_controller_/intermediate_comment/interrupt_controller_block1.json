    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for reading or writing data to specific addresses in response to the West Bridge (wb) interface signals. The always block listens for a positive edge reset or clock signal. If either is detected, and if the reset is high, it does nothing, but if it's low, it checks for a read acknowledgment or a start write signal from the West Bridge. Depending on the address (i_wb_adr) value, a different message is displayed indicating what action is being taken (read/write), what data is being read or written (i_wb_dat or o_wb_dat), and the specific register being accessed. The case statement facilitates register addressing for different operations like status check, raw status, enable set, and clear in the interrupt controller module, subdivided further to IRQ/FIRQ and their respective indices. If the address does not match any pre-defined registers, it displays an unknown Amber IC Register and reports an error message."
