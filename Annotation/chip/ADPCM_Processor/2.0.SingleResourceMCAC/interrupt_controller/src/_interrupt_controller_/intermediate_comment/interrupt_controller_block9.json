    "block_comment": "This block of code is a flip-flop that is sensitive to the positive edges of either a reset signal or a clock signal. When the circuit is reset, the block clears a signal called wb_start_read_d1 by setting its value to 0. However, during a clock change (without reset), the block updates the value of wb_start_read_d1 to match the current value of wb_start_read. Thus, it effectively creates a one clock-cycle delay for the wb_start_read signal, barring an intervening reset."
