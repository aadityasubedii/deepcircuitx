    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a write-back acknowledge signal (`o_wb_ack`). It employs a boolean expression combining a write-back strobe input (`i_wb_stb`) with the OR'ed results of write and read start stages (`wb_start_write` and `wb_start_read_d1` respectively). When the write-back strobe is active and either a read or write stage begins in the respective cycle, then it will acknowledge the action."
