    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the generation and masking of ordinary (IRQ) and fast (FIRQ) interrupts in a two-level interrupt system. It acts as an interrupt controller, defining which interrupts are enabled or disabled based on the contents of irq/firq_enable_reg and softint_0/1_reg. The block combines raw, software-generated, and test interrupts to form two aggregated IRQ and FIRQ signals for two channels (0 and 1). These are bitwise OR'd to form two final outputs o_irq and o_firq, which indicate if any IRQ or FIRQ is active across the two channels."
