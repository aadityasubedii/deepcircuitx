It handles raw interrupts from different sources including UART, timer, and other test registers, managing how these interrupt signals are processed. The controller has data width and select width as defining parameters and contains various input and output wires to handle data transfer and signals. The controller also interfaces with the Wishbone B4 system-on-chip interface, adopting its signaling conventions for data transfers. Functions include enabling and disabling interrupts, setting and clearing software interrupts, and acknowledging and handling interrupt events. Under debug mode, it further provides detailed debugging information about the interrupt transactions."
