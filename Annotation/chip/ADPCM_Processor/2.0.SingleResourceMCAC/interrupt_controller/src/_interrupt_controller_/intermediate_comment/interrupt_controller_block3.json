    "block_comment": "This block manages the enabling, resetting and handling of interrupts and fast interrupts for a two-core AMBER IC system based on clock or reset signals. On reset, all the registers related to interrupts and soft interrupts for both cores are cleared. During a write cycle, based on the written address, the code modifies corresponding registers using bitwise operations. Sets or clears interrupt enables and soft interrupts depending upon the signal from the Wishbone Bus data wire (i_wb_dat). For different addresses, corresponding registers like irq0_enable_reg, firq0_enable_reg, softint_0_reg, irq1_enable_reg, firq1_enable_reg, softint_1_reg are updated. Subsequent bitwise operations set or clear particular bits in these registers, effectively enabling, setting, or clearing the respective interrupts or fast interrupts."
