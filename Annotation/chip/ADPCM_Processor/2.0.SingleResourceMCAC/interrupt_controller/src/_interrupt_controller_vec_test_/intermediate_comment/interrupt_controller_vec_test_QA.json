The test module instantiates the \"interrupt_controller\" and connects its inputs and outputs to local variables and wires. It does not have any in-depth logic operation in itself. It sets a specific time format, and potentially annotates the system delay function file if 'SDFSCAN' is defined during compilation. All signals such as 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_inX', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' are initialized to zero.
