Module name: test. 

Module specification: The 'test' module is a top-level testing module, constructed primarily for testing an "interrupt_controller" module. The module provides the testing framework without any complex logic operations, mainly used for simulation tests and timing checks. Its definition includes several input ports, including 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_inX', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode', and output ports like 'scan_outX'. These ports are control and testing signals. 'clk' and 'reset' manage the synchronization and resetting of operations within the module. 'scan_inX' ports and 'scan_enable' signal initiate the scan-mode testing, and 'test_mode' determines if the operations are in regular or testing phase. 'scan_outX' are output ports that carry the results of the scan testing. Internally, these signals are registered and used to connect to the "interrupt_controller" module. The initialization block sets a time format and annotates a system delay function file if 'SDFSCAN' is defined during the module compilation. This block also initializes all signals to a default value of zero. Through this structure, the 'test' module provides an essential testing structure for the "interrupt_controller".
