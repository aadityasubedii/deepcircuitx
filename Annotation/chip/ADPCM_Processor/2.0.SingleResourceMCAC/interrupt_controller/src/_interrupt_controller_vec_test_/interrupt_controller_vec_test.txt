Module-level comment: The 'test' module provides a testing framework for an "interrupt_controller". It connects and controls the necessary signals for testing procedures. Input and output scan signals ('scan_inX' and 'scan_outX') handle the scan-mode testing while 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' manage synchronization, resetting and mode selection. These test-specified signals are initialized to zero faciliting simulation tests. A system delay function file annotation is provided if 'SDFSCAN' is defined. It sets a specific time format for operational timing checks.
