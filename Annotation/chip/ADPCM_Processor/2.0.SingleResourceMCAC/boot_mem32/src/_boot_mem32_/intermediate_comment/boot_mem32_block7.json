    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for handling data write and read operations in a Wishbone Bus. It operates in a simple yet efficient manner. Firstly, it establishes a faultless condition by setting 'o_wb_err' to zero. Following this, it assigns the incoming write data ('i_wb_dat') and byte enable signals ('i_wb_sel') to the respective variables. For read operation, it assigns the stored 'read_data' to the outgoing data ('o_wb_dat'). Lastly, it extracts the relevant address bits from the incoming address ('i_wb_adr') using the defined memory address width ('MADDR_WIDTH')."
