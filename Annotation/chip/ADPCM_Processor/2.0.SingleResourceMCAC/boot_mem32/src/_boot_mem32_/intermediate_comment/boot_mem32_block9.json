    "block_comment": "This block of code, implemented in Verilog RTL, manages the starting of a read process based on certain conditions. On every positive-edge clock cycle (i_wb_clk), the block checks whether the 'start_read' signal is high. If it is, it queues the starting of the read process by shifting 'start_read' into the lower order bit of the start_read_r register. If an acknowledgement signal (o_wb_ack) is received, it resets the 'start_read_r' register to 0. If neither condition is true, the block shifts the 'start_read_r' register one bit to the left and appends 'start_read' in the least significant bit. This is typically how FIFO operations are implemented in hardware design, allowing read operations to be started and tracked based on acknowledgements and clock cycles."
