    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the affirmation of a Wishbone bus transaction in AMBER processor's debug and normal mode. The `o_wb_ack` signal is asserted when a strobe (`i_wb_stb`) occurs simultaneously with either a write (`start_write`) or a read operation which varies based on the debugging mode. For the debugging mode, a read operation is determined based on a `start_read_r` indexed with the 2nd bit of `jitter_r`. However, in normal mode, `start_read_r` is directly used to confirm a read operation."
