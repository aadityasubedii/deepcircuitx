    "block_comment": "The block of code controls conditional compilation for the Xilinx FPGA device, specifically for a 4KB SRAM with byte enable. If BOOT_MEM32_PARAMS_FILE is defined it includes the file specified by the macro. If it's not defined, it checks if BOOT_LOADER_ETHMAC is defined. If so, it includes \"boot-loader-ethmac_memparams32.v\". If not, it includes the \"boot-loader_memparams32.v\" file. The macros BOOT_MEM32_PARAMS_FILE and BOOT_LOADER_ETHMAC seem to be used for customization and specific configurations."
