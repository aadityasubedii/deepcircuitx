    "module": "Module-level comment: boot_mem32 is a simulated memory module for a bootloader that reads and writes data based on the given control signals via the Wishbone bus. It uses internal signals to indicate and control the start of read or write operations, while also offering a debug mode for adding randomness. The module uses input and output buses for data transfer and signals for control and error notification, offering interactive capability with either a Xilinx FPGA or a generic SRAM. The memory addresses and parameters are generated from an external file allowing for easy reconfiguration."
