    "block_comment": "This block of code displays a boot memory file name in the simulation console. It leverages the $display system task of Verilog hardware description language as an initial construct which is executed only once at the beginning of simulation. With the $display system task, it prints the formatted string displaying the name of the boot memory file from the `BOOT_MEM32_PARAMS_FILE` system variable."
