This block of code defines a module called "generic_sram_byte_en" that is not declared or executed for XILINX FPGAs, intended to serve as an interface for generic SRAM with byte enable functionality. It utilizes parameterized design to provide variable data and address widths, with the parameters 'DATA_WIDTH' and 'ADDRESS_WIDTH' being set to 'WB_DWIDTH' and 'MADDR_WIDTH' respectively, thereby enhancing flexibility and reusability.
