This block of code implements a 8-bit pseudo-random number generator using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) configuration. On every rising edge of the 'i_wb_clk' signal, the existing value of the variable 'jitter_r' is shifted to the left by one bit, with the 8th bit being an xor of the 8th, 5th and 2nd bits of the original 'jitter_r'.
