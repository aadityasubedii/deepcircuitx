Comment: 
The block of code functions as an interface to the memory unit, allowing for read and write operations. It accepts signals to determine whether to execute a write operation (`i_write_enable`), the specific byte that should be enabled for the operation (`i_byte_enable`), and the memory address to interact with (`i_address`). It also handles the storage of data to write to the memory unit (`i_write_data`). If a read operation is in progress, the data read from the memory unit is provided in the output (`o_read_data`).
