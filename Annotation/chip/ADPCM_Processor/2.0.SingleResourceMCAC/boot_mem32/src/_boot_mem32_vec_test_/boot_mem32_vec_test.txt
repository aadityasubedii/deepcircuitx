Module-level comment: The 'test' module interfaces with an instantiated 'boot_mem32' module, facilitating different operational modes (including test modes), controlled via internally regulated signals like 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode'. It features five scan input/output pairs for test observations. An initial block sets up simulation environment, resets all signals, and ends the simulation. Its exact use may vary as it's largely dependent on the 'boot_mem32' module functioning.
