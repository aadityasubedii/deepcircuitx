    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module is a top-level module predominantly used for interfacing with another module named 'boot_mem32'. It provides a control interface comprising clock ('clk'), reset signals ('reset'), five scan input signals ('scan_in0' to 'scan_in4'), a 'scan_enable' signal and a 'test_mode' signal. All these signals are of 'reg' data type suggesting they are internally controllable. Consequently 'test' module operates in different modes altered by the 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' signals. There are five output signals ('scan_out0' to 'scan_out4') of 'wire' data type, typically facilitating observability of test results during the testing process. The principal component of the 'test' module is 'boot_mem32' module. It's instantiation 'top' is interfaced and controlled via the aforementioned input and output signals. An initial block is defined that initially executes during simulation. It starts by setting the time formatting followed by potentially annotating a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file for gate-level simulation based on the 'SDFSCAN' compiler directive. Afterwards, all the signals are reset to their initial zero state. The initial block execution is then terminated by calling '$finish' that is commonly used to end the simulation. It should be noted that the specific use of 'test' module may vary depending on the internal dynamics of the interfaced 'boot_mem32' module.",
