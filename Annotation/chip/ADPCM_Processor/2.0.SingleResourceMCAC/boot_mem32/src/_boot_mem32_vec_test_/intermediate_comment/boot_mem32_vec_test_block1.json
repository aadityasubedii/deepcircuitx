    "block_comment": "This block is utilized for initializing the simulation environment and variables. It sets up the clock, reset, and scan variables along with specific formats and attributes for simulation using system functions. It primarily sets the 'timeformat' for time display during simulation in nanoseconds, optionally (based on the 'SDFSCAN' directive) annotates Standard Delay Format (SDF) data for timing information and then initializes certain variables such as 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' to zero right before ending the initialization block."
