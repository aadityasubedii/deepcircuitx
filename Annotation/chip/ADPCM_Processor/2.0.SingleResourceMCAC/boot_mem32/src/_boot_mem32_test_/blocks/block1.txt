This block of code sets up the initial state of the system and the simulation time format. It initially sets the system time to have a nanosecond-level resolution with a precision of two decimal places. If the SDFSCAN macro is defined, it will annotate the simulation with SDF timing from a specified file. Following that, it initializes digital signals (clk, reset, scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_enable, test_mode) to a low logic level (0) to clear any undefined state. The code block concludes with the $finish command, which indicates the end of the simulation setup.
