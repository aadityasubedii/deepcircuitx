Module-level comment: The 'test' module simulates and tests the 'boot_mem32' module's functionality using DFT scan operations. It initializes the 'boot_mem32' with zero values for 'clk', 'reset', scan inputs ('scan_in0' to 'scan_in4'), 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' signals. The module receives test results through 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' after the test operation. Internally, signals control timing, state resetting, test data insertion, scan operation enabling, and test mode switching. The module ends with the execution of the initial block setting timeformat and optionally annotating an SDF file.
