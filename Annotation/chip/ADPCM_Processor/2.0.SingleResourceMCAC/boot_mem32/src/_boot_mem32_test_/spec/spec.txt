Module name: test.

Module specification: The 'test' module serves as a behavioral simulation setup for a 'boot_mem32' module, mainly designed to test its functionality using Design for Testability (DFT) scan operations. The module initializes the 'boot_mem32' module using the input ports of a clock signal, a reset signal, five scan data input signals (scan_in0 to scan_in4), a scan enable signal, and a test mode signal. All these signals are set to zero initially. The output of this 'test' module is obtained through five scan data output signals (scan_out0 to scan_out4), which retrieve the test results or data from the 'boot_mem32' module after the test mode operation. Internal signals such as 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0 - scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' are utilized by the module to control and time its operations. Among these, 'clk' helps in guiding the sequence of operations, 'reset' brings the module to a known state, 'scan_in0 - scan_in4' are used for inputting test data into the design, 'scan_enable' controls the entry and exit of the test data, and 'test_mode' switches the module into a special test mode. The 'test' module consists of two main parts or blocks. The first block is the initialization and setup of the 'boot_mem32' device, which includes the injection of test data, enabling the scan operation, and switching into test mode. The second block is the initial block of code which sets the formats for time and annotates a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file if 'SDFSCAN' macro is defined, after which the simulation test is completed and the program execution finishes. Overall, the 'test' module allows for a careful and efficient testing of the 'boot_mem32' module under simulated initial conditions.
