I apologize for any misunderstanding, but it seems the provided code (`timescale 1ns / 1ns) doesn't provide sufficient information to create a detailed module specification. The given single line of Verilog code simply stipulates that the time system for the module is in nanoseconds, but it does not inform us about:

1. The name of the module: The module name is not provided in the code snippet.
2. The module's functionality: No information regarding functionality can be discerned from the given code.
3. Input and output ports: No ports are defined in the given code.
4. Internal signals used within the module: The code doesn't define or use any signals.
5. Code blocks and their functions: There are no code blocks or process blocks defined within the code snippet provided.

For a thorough and comprehensive module specification, please provide the complete RTL code that includes the module name, functionality, declared input/output ports, internal signals, and their associated code blocks.
