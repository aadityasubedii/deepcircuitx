The repository ZJUI-BattleCity-ECE385-final consists of a complex System-on-Chip (SoC) design tailored for educational and development purposes in a lab setting. Within this repository, various modules manage tasks like clock generation, interfacing, memory management, synchronization, and signal conversion with an emphasis on modularity and reusability. Each module, such as the 'sram_clk', 'ocm_clk', and 'vga_clk', utilizes a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for generating synchronized clock signals suitable for VGA displays and SRAM operations, evidencing a robust handling of clock-related functionalities across multiple subsystems. The SoC design integrates a Nios II processor and handles complex interconnections between components like OTG HPI, SDRAM, and a JTAG UART, showcasing elaborate control over data operations and communication via the lab7_soc modules and its sub-modules like the onchip memory, interconnect interfaces, and debug utilities. Submodules specifically address tasks like data synchronization across clock domains, error management in communication protocols, and memory access operations, providing a comprehensive testbed for SoC developments and debugging within an FPGA context. Through simulation and synthesis submodules, the repository thoroughly explores functionality validations and performance optimizations, ensuring a versatile learning platform for understanding and implementing intricate hardware designs.
