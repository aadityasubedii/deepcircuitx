    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'sram_clk' module generates a clock signal for an SRAM system using the altpll component, transforming the 'inclk0' input clock into a tailored output clock 'c0'. Internally, it utilizes a set of wires named 'sub_wire0' through 'sub_wire4' to connect and map signals. The altpll component configures the new clock signal, with its parameters set for the desired output clock attributes. Overall, the purpose of this module is to provide accurate synchronization for data operations within the SRAM system."
