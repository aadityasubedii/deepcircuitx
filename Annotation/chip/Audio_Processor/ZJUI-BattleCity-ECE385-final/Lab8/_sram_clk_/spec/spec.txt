Module name: sram_clk. 

Module specification: The sram_clk module is a clock generator for an SRAM system built using Verilog RTL, primarily providing clock synchronization for system and data operations. The core functionality of the sram_clk module is handled by the altpll (Altera Phase-Locked Loop) component which converts an input clock signal to an output clock signal with specified attributes. The input clock signal is received via the 'inclk0' input port which can be sourced from an external clock or another module. The generated output clock signal is transmitted via the 'c0' output port, which then serves other modules. Internally, the module uses five signals: 'sub_wire2', 'sub_wire3', 'sub_wire0', 'sub_wire1', and 'sub_wire4'. 'sub_wire0' is a mirror representation of 'inclk0', 'sub_wire2' is a single-bit wire with a fixed value, 'sub_wire1' is the combination of 'sub_wire0' and 'sub_wire2' that goes into the altpll component, 'sub_wire3' fetches the array of clock signals from the altpll component, and 'sub_wire4' holds the immediate clock signal to be transmitted outside the module. Primarily, this module is divided into two sections â€“ signal declaration that defines input, output and internal signals, and altpll component configuration where all the specifications for clock transformation are given.
