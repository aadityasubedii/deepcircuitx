    "spec": "Module name: sram_clk_altpll.\n\nModule specification: \nThe sram_clk_altpll module is a clock generator for an SRAM using a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) from the CycloneIV_E PLL family. The main functionality is clock signal generation and adjustment according to requirements defined like frequency and phase. It consists of 2 input ports. The input port 'inclk' as [1:0] are two input clocks that enter the module and are manipulated by the PLL. Other input ports include '.areset', '.clkswitch', '.configupdate', '.phaseupdown', '.phasecounterselect' and a few others which function to control and maintain the operation of the PLL such as resetting, clock switching, frequency phase detection, phase stepping and so on. \n\nThe module generates a single output clock through the output port 'clk' as [4:0], processed by the PLL according to configuration parameters. \n\nThe internal operations of the module rely on two main internal signals namely 'wire_pll1_clk' and 'wire_pll1_fbout'. These are used to pass and provide feedback about the processed clock signal within the module. \n\nThe code structure consists of defining the output and input ports, defining the internal wires, instantiation of cycloneive_pll, setting parameters for PLL and assignment of the final clock signal to the 'clk' output. These operations are used to maintain phase and frequency lock in addition to controlling clock parameters according to the specifications. In essence, the sram_clk_altpll is a crucial module for providing consistent and reliable clock signals for the operation of SRAM modules.",

It takes 2 input clocks (inclk) and outputs a single clock (clk). The output clock frequency and phase is determined by several parameters such as clk0_divide_by, clk0_duty_cycle, clk0_multiply_by, and clk0_phase_shift. The functionality includes signal scanning, phase shifting, locking, and checking for over and under-range. Specific operations are determined by configuration parameters set within the module. This module will likely be used to provide a consistent and reliable clock signal for the operation of SRAM modules."
