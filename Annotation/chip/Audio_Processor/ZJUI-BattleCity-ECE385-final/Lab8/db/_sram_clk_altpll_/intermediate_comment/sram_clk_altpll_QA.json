It takes 2 input clocks (inclk) and outputs a single clock (clk). The output clock frequency and phase is determined by several parameters such as clk0_divide_by, clk0_duty_cycle, clk0_multiply_by, and clk0_phase_shift. The functionality includes signal scanning, phase shifting, locking, and checking for over and under-range. Specific operations are determined by configuration parameters set within the module. This module will likely be used to provide a consistent and reliable clock signal for the operation of SRAM modules."
