Module-level comment: The 'sram_clk_altpll' is a clock generator module for an SRAM, using a Phase Locked Loop embedded cycle from the CycloneIV_E family. It primarily manipulates two input clocks (inclk) to generate an output clock signal (clk). This is done through a slew of operations involving signal scanning, phase shifting, and lock checking. The clock parameters are set by internal adjustments and controlled by specific input and internal signals. The module primarily serves in providing a consistent, reliable clock signal for SRAM operations.
