    "spec": "Module name: vga_clk_altpll.\n\nModule specification: \n\nThe module vga_clk_altpll is a wrapper for a cycloneive_pll (phase locked loop) implementation. This module takes the input clock signal inclk[1:0] and generates a synchronous output clock signal clk[4:0] using the phase-locked loop method. The main purpose it serves is to generate and control clock signals where the output frequency is controlled based on specified multiply and divide parameters within the PLL configuration.\n\nThe input port for this module includes inclk[1:0], representing the input clock signal. The output port includes clk[4:0], representing the output clock signal which is generated by the PLL.\n\nInternally, it has signals wire_pll1_clk[4:0] and wire_pll1_fbout. wire_pll1_clk[4:0] are the signals generated from the PLL configuration which is later assigned to the output clock signal clk[4:0]. wire_pll1_fbout is a signal primarily used for feedback within the PLL, understanding the synchronization between input and output clocks.\n\nThe module defines a cycloneive_pll block (pll1) which includes the aforementioned input, output, and internal signals among others for PLL operations. The specifications of pll1 are later set within 'defparam' block to define various parameters like bandwidth, division, multiplication etc., related to PLL operations.\n\nThe PLL's operation characteristics are controlled via various signals inside the \"cycloneive_pll\" instantiation block. Some of these control signals are kept static (e.g., .areset(1'b0), .clkswitch(1'b0)), while others like .scanclkena(1'b1) enables the scan clock.  The key functionality of the PLL system is largely wrapped in this block.\n\nOverall, this module serves to create a reliable, phase-locked clock signal with configurability for real-time applications.",
