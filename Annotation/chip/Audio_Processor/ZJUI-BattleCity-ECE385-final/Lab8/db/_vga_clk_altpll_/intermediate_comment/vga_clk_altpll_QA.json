This PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal (inclk). The PLL guarantees that the output signal (clk) and the input signal (inclk) are a synchronous sequence, which is used for clock generation and control. The module's configuration indicates the multiply and divide parameters of the PLL, establishing the output frequency of the clock.
