Module-level comment: 

This module, vga_clk_altpll, is a wrapper for a cycloneive_pll used to generate a synchronous clock signal. It takes an input clock signal inclk[1:0] and outputs a controlled frequency signal through clk[4:0] using a phase-locked loop. Internal signals like wire_pll1_clk[4:0] and wire_pll1_fbout facilitate this process, with the former being the generated signals from PLL and the latter for maintaining synchronization. Its functionality is largely encapsulated in a cycloneive_pll block (pll1) with configurations set via 'defparam', controlling various parameters like bandwidth, division, multiplication for the pll operation.
