    "spec": "Module name: ocm_clk_altpll. \n\nModule specification: The \u2018ocm_clk_altpll\u2019 is a Verilog RTL code module designed for clock signal operations, specifically as a phase-locked loop (PLL) structure. The module accepts two clocks as input (denoted as \u2018inclk\u2019) and thereafter generates five output clocks (denoted as 'clk'). The generated clocks have the same frequency as the input clocks but may exhibit different phases. Comprising both an input and output component, the input includes two clock signals ('inclk [1:0]'), which are used as reference clocks for the module. The output component conveniently produces five clock signals ('clk [4:0]'), each mirroring the frequency of the input clocks albeit with potentially different timing phases.\n\nWithin the system, two internal signals play critical roles. These are 'wire_pll1_clk [4:0]' and 'wire_pll1_fbout'. While the former carries the generated clock signals prior to their assignment as module output, the latter functions as a feedback output clock signal, used within the PLL block to ascertain that the system remains locked to the frequency of the input clock.\n\nThe module comprises various sections in the code which all carry out unique functions. Most notable is the instantiation of the 'cycloneive_pll' component called 'pll1'. It features parameter settings such as bandwidth type, clock frequencies, duty cycles, phase shift values, and operation mode, among others. These parameters are tailored within the 'defparam' section of the instantiated PLL. Lastly, the output clock signals are assigned to 'clk' from the 'wire_pll1_clk'. Consequently, this module effectively functions as an integral system for managing clock signal operations within digital systems.",
