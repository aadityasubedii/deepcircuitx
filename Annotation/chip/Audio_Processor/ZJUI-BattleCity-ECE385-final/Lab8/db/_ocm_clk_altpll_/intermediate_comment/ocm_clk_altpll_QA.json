The multiple clock outputs have the same frequency as the input clock but different phases. The PLL uses the cycloneive_pll component, which is normally used in Altera Cyclone IV devices. All the functional controls for operation mode, clock frequency, and phase control parameters, among other settings, are specified in the defparam section."
