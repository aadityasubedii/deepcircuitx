    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'ocm_clk_altpll' module in Verilog is a phase-locked loop (PLL), receiving two input clocks and generating five output clocks with matching frequencies but varied phases. Implementation utilizes the 'cycloneive_pll' component ('pll1') and two internal signals, one carrying the output clocks ('wire_pll1_clk') and the other used for feedback ('wire_pll1_fbout'). The 'defparam' section defines control settings and the output clocks are assigned from 'wire_pll1_clk' to 'clk'."
