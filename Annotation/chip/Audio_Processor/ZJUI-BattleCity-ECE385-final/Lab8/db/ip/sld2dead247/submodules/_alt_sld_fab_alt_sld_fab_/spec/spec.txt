I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The "original Verilog code" you shared appears to be heavily corrupted or encoded, consisting mostly of non-printable characters and symbols rather than readable Verilog RTL code. Without access to legible code and proper comments, it's not possible to accurately determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure.

To create a meaningful specification, I would need to see the actual, uncorrupted Verilog RTL code. If you have access to the original, readable version of the code, please share that instead. Once I can see the proper code, I'd be happy to analyze it and provide a detailed specification including all the elements you've requested.
