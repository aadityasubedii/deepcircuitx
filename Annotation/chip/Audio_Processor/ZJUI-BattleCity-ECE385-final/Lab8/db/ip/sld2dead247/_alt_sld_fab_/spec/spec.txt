I'm sorry, but as it stands, the Verilog code you provided is unintelligible. It might be garbled or corrupted. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there's anything meaningful that can be extracted from the provided code.

For creating the module specification, I would need the following details from a valid Verilog RTL code:

1. Module's name: Usually after the keyword 'module' at the start of the code.
2. Functionality: This would be deduced from the comments and logic within the code.
3. Input and Output Ports: Defined at the start within the module declaration including their bit widths.
4. Internal signals: Any wire or reg declarations inside the module, excluding the ports.
5. Blocks or sections: Again, these can be deduced from comments, proper formatting, and discrete initial/end, always blocks.

With these details and a valid Verilog code, I can create a specification you're asking for. But currently, I'm not able to assist with the provided data. Please provide a valid Verilog RTL code for the same.
