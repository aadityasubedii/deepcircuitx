Module-level comment: The ocm_clk module fundamentally manipulates clock signals. It ingests an input clock "inclk0", which is processed through a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) facilitated by the altpll component configured with specific parameters such as division and multiplication factors and phase shift. The PLL-generated, potentially phase-shifted and frequency-altered clock is then outputted via "c0". Process includes initialization of internal signals representing, combining and transferring intermediate states of clock signal.
