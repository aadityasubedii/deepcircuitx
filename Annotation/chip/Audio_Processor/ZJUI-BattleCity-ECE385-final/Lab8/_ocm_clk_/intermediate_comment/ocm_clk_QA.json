Internally, it has a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) component specified as altpll. The altpll component is designed to manipulate the input clock, inclk0, by dividing, multiplying and can also apply a phase shift. All these parameters are specified within altpll_component properties which follow the \"defparam\" statement. This configuration allows for the output clock signal to have a different frequency and phase than the input clock signal. Overall, this module is typically used for clock signal management tasks such as frequency scaling, clock signal generation and phase management.\n"
