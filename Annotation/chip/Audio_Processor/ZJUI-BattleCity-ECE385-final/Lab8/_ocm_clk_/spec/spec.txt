Module name: ocm_clk. 

Module specification: The ocm_clk module acts as a clock signal handler and manipulator designed for use with the Verilog RTL language. Its primary function is to imbibe an input clock signal, process it through a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) circuit advanced by the altpll component, and output an altered clock signal with potentially altered frequency and phase characteristics.

The module has one input port, "inclk0", which is the entry point for the input clock signal being handled. This signal is then further represented internally as a wire, "sub_wire0". The module also has one output port, "c0", which provides the processed clock signal.

The module code uses several internal wires, each designated a specific role. "sub_wire0" is a direct replica of the input clock signal. "sub_wire1" is a 2-bit vector composed of "sub_wire2" and "sub_wire0", playing the role of the clock input for altpll component. "sub_wire2" is a single bit fixed to 0, facilitating "sub_wire1" creation. "sub_wire3" comprises of five bits - the width of the manipulated clock signal. Lastly, "sub_wire4" is utilized to pass the altered clock signal to the output port from the altpll unit. 

The code can primarily be sectioned into signal declarations and the altpll component configuration. The first section declares and assigns values to various inputs, outputs and wires. The next section initializes the altpll_component which manipulates the given clock signal as per declared parameters such as division factor, multiplication factor, and phase shift. Thus, in a nutshell, the ocm_clk module manages frequency scaling, clock signal generation and phase adjustments.
