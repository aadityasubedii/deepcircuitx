Module-level comment: 
```verilog
// The vga_clk module generates a VGA compatible clock signal. It takes an
// input clock 'inclk0' and produces an output clock 'c0'. The module
// uses a Phase-locked loop (altpll_component) to adjust the frequency
// of the input clock. The input is given to the PLL using a combination 
// of wires (sub_wire1). The PLL's output (sub_wire3) is selected by its 
// least significant bit (sub_wire4) and is designated as the module's output.
