    "module": "Module-level comment: \n```verilog\n// The vga_clk module generates a VGA compatible clock signal. It takes an\n// input clock 'inclk0' and produces an output clock 'c0'. The module\n// uses a Phase-locked loop (altpll_component) to adjust the frequency\n// of the input clock. The input is given to the PLL using a combination \n// of wires (sub_wire1). The PLL's output (sub_wire3) is selected by its \n// least significant bit (sub_wire4) and is designated as the module's output.\n```\n"
