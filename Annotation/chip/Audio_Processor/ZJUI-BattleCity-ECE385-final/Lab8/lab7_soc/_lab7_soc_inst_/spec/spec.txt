Module name: lab7_soc. 

Module specification: The "lab7_soc" module in this context represents a specific block related to some system-on-a-chip (SoC) design. Detailed functionality of this module can't be provided from this code snippet as the internal logic of the module is not provided. 

The module has the following input ports: `clk_clk`, likely a main system clock; `reset_reset_n`, a reset signal; `sdram_clk_clk`, which seems to be the clock for SDRAM operations; `otg_hpi_address_export`, `otg_hpi_cs_export`, `otg_hpi_r_export`, `otg_hpi_reset_export`, `otg_hpi_w_export` and `otg_hpi_data_in_port` related to OTG HPI operation; `sdram_wire_addr`, `sdram_wire_ba`, `sdram_wire_cas_n`, `sdram_wire_cke`, `sdram_wire_cs_n`, `sdram_wire_dqm`, `sdram_wire_ras_n`, and `sdram_wire_we_n`, controlling specific attributes in SDRAM transactions. 

The module has the following output ports: `keycode_2_export`, `keycode_0_export`, `keycode_1_export` delivering output keycode information; `otg_hpi_data_out_port`, serving as the output data for OTG HPI. 

Additionally, `sdram_wire_dq` seems to be an inout port serving as the data lines for SDRAM operations. 

Since only the module instantiation is provided without the actual module body, information about internal signals, specific blocks or sections, and their functions is not included in the provided Verilog code. More detailed information could be obtained by analyzing the full RTL code of the 'lab7_soc' module.
