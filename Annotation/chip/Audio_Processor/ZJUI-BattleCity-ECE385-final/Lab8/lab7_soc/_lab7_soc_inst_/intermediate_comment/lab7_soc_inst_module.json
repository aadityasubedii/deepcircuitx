    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"lab7_soc\" module represents a key block within a system-on-chip design. Operating under main system clock `clk_clk` and reset signal `reset_reset_n`, it manages interactions with peripherals, including SDRAM memory and OTG HPI communication via respective control lines. In addition, it also exports specific keycodes. The lack of a module body in the provided code restricts detailed info about the actual implementation or internal workings of the module."
