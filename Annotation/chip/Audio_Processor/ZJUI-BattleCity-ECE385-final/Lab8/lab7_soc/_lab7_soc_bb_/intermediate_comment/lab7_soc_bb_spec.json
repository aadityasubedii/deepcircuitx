An inout port, 'sdram_wire_dq', is a bidirectional data bus for interfacing with SDRAM.\n\nAs per available information, no explicit internal signals or different blocks of code are defined within the module for instantiating modules or procedures for internal operations. The module comprises only of IO ports and their connectivity; hence, no procedural or functional blocks are detailed in the provided RTL code.
