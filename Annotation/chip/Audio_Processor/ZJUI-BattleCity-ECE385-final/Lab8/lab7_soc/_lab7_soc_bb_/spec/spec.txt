Module name: lab7_soc

Module specification: The 'lab7_soc' module serves as a top-level coordination unit for a system-on-chip (SOC) design. It interfaces with multiple subsystems, including a keycode export system, an On-The-Go (OTG) Host Port Interface (HPI), a reset circuit and a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM).

Inputs to this module include 'clk_clk', which is a clock signal for operation synchronization and timing, 'otg_hpi_data_in_port' that serves as a 16-bit input connected to the HPI of an OTG USB system, and 'reset_reset_n' that serves the purpose of resetting the module to its default settings.

The module outputs include keycode exports ('keycode_2_export', 'keycode_0_export' and 'keycode_1_export'), 16-bit outputs likely connected to a decoding unit, OTG HPI controls ('otg_hpi_address_export', 'otg_hpi_cs_export', 'otg_hpi_data_out_port', 'otg_hpi_r_export', 'otg_hpi_reset_export', 'otg_hpi_w_export') to manage read, write and reset operations, a peculiar SDRAM control and address lines including 'sdram_clk_clk', 'sdram_wire_addr', 'sdram_wire_ba', 'sdram_wire_cas_n', 'sdram_wire_cke', 'sdram_wire_cs_n' and 'sdram_wire_ras_n'. An inout port, 'sdram_wire_dq', is a bidirectional data bus for interfacing with SDRAM.

As per available information, no explicit internal signals or different blocks of code are defined within the module for instantiating modules or procedures for internal operations. The module comprises only of IO ports and their connectivity; hence, no procedural or functional blocks are detailed in the provided RTL code. The module can be assumed to be a shell, with the internal implementation missing in this provided context. The exact operation of the module would become apparent when the internals of the module get implemented or defined.
