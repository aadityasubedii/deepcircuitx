Module-level comment: The 'lab7_soc' module is a top-level unit in a SOC design. It interfaces with multiple subsystems like OTG HPI, SDRAM and a keycode export system, using inputs such as a clock signal ('clk_clk'), OTG HPI data input ('otg_hpi_data_in_port') and reset control ('reset_reset_n'). Outputs include keycode exports, OTG HPI controls, and SDRAM control/address lines. An inout 'sdram_wire_dq' serves as a bidirectional bus for SDRAM. Implementation details are not provided; this module appears to be a shell awaiting internal design.
