    "block_comment": "This block of code constitutes a synchronous reset circuit for the 'd_read' register in a digital system. It functions by monitoring for a rising edge in the 'clk' signal or a falling edge in 'reset_n' signal. On the falling edge of 'reset_n', which represents an active-low reset signal, it clears 'd_read' register to a known state (0). Otherwise, during a positive edge of the clock signal, it updates the 'd_read' register with the next state 'd_read_nxt'."
