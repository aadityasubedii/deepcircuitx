Comment: 
This block of Verilog code assigns the value of a logical shift operation to `D_ctrl_shift_logical`. It achieves this by performing a bitwise OR operation on `D_op_slli`, `D_op_sll`, `D_op_srli`, and `D_op_srl`. The result determines whether a logical shift instruction is active in the decoder stage of the data pipeline.
