This block establishes a clock crosser module, which is used to cross data from one clock domain to another safely. It uses the altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser architecture to ensure data integrity during the crossing. The module parameters like SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT, BITS_PER_SYMBOL, FORWARD_SYNC_DEPTH, etc., are defined to tune the module performance. The parameters in_clk, in_reset, in_ready, in_valid, and in_data are inputs to the clock domain crossing module, and out_clk, out_reset, out_ready, out_valid and out_data are the outputs. It also takes into account the possibility of pipeline delay by parameterizing USE_OUTPUT_PIPELINE. The functionality is achieved using the Altera predefined module for clock crossing.
