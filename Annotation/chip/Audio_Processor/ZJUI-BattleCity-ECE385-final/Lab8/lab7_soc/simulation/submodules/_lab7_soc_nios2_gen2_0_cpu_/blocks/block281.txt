This block of code is assigning the value of `oci_hbreak_req` to the `oci_tb_hbreak_req` signal. It is a simple assignment in Verilog, which copies the state of `oci_hbreak_req` to `oci_tb_hbreak_req` every time `oci_hbreak_req` changes. In other words, it connects the signal `oci_tb_hbreak_req` to `oci_hbreak_req`, such that changes to `oci_hbreak_req` are reflected in `oci_tb_hbreak_req`. Therefore, this line of code ensures that `oci_tb_hbreak_req` will always hold the same value as `oci_hbreak_req`.
