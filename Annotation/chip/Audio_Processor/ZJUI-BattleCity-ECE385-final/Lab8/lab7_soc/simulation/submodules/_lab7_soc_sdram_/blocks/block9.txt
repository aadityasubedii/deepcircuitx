Comment: 
This block performs a conditional logic operation to generate a read strobe signal. It examines the least significant 3 bits (from bit 2 to bit 0) of the 'm_cmd' signal and assigns the resulting value to the 'rd_strobe' signal. The 'rd_strobe' signal becomes '1' when these 3 bits equal to binary 101 (or decimal 5), otherwise, it becomes '0'.
