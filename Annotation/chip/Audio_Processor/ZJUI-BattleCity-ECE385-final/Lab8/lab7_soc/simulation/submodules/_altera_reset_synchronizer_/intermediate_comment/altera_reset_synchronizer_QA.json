It takes an input reset signal and generates an output reset signal synchronized to the provided clock signal. It has 2 behavior modes depending on the ASYNC_RESET flag. If ASYNC_RESET is active, the reset is applied asynchronously, meaning it is immediately applied on the rising edge of the reset signal or the clock. If it's not active, the reset is synchronized to the clock. The module supports depth customization of the internal reset chain."
