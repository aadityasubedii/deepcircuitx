This block assigns the value to `fifo_14_mux` based on various conditions. It checks the write-pointer (`fifo_wrptr`) status and checks for the validity of three different signals: itm, atm, and dtm. If the write-pointer is at position 14 and any of itm, atm, dtm are valid, then `itm`, `overflow_pending_atm`, or `overflow_pending_dtm` are chosen respectively. For the write-pointer at position plus 1 of 14, provided `ge2_free` is high, it checks the validity of different combinations of itm, atm, dtm validity status to choose between `overflow_pending_atm` and `overflow_pending_dtm`. If none of these conditions are met, it signs `overflow_pending_dtm` by default.
