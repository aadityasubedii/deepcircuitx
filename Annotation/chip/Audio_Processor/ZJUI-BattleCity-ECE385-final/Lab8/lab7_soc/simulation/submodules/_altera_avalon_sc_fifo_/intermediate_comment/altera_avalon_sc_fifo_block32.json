    "block_comment": "This block conditionally generates hardware named 'gen_blk14' when the value of EMPTY_LATENCY is greater than 1. In Verilog, the keyword 'generate' is used to dynamically instantiate architecture based on a certain condition (in this case, EMPTY_LATENCY > 1). Therefore, this block might include circuit logic or submodules which further depend on the EMPTY_LATENCY parameter. Notably, this kind of conditional hardware creation can help manage complexity and make code more scalable and reusable."
