    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to manage the count of a synchronous timer. The block achieves this by conditionally assigning the next state for 'sync_timer'. If 'sync_timer_reached_zero' is true, the 'sync_timer' retains its current state, otherwise, it gets decremented by 1."
