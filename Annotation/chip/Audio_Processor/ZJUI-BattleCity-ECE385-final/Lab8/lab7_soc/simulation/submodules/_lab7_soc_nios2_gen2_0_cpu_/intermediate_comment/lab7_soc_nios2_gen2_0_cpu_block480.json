    "block_comment": "This code block handles the functionality of E_xbrk_traceoff, which acts as a trace-off signal for a break in the code. At the rising edge of the clock signal or the falling edge of reset, this block resets \"E_xbrk_traceoff\" if reset is active (low). If the reset is not active, and \"E_cpu_addr_en\" is enabled, the state of the signal gets updated with the value of \"xbrk_toff_hit\"."
