    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for assigning the value of `D_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16` to `R_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16_nxt` in the next cycle. It's implemented using the `assign` keyword, implying a continuous assignment statement in Verilog RTL. The operation occurs whenever there's a change in the value of `D_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16`, subsequently triggering the update in `R_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16_nxt`."
