It is essentially a data transfer mechanism which forms an integral part of the Avalon Streaming interface. The module works on both registered and unregistered pipeline types. The pipeline's fullness is controlled and managed by the 'full' registers and is synchronized with a clock and can be reset. The data width is flexible and depends on the parameters SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT and BITS_PER_SYMBOL. The input and output data are buffered in the module and their validity is controlled by the 'valid' signals and the readiness is controlled by 'ready' signals."

It serves as the timing reference for all operations and state transitions within the module.\n2. reset: This is the reset signal input. When activated, it brings the module state back to initial conditions. Typically, it clears all data and status flags within the module.\n3. in_valid: This is a signal that indicates whether the data on the 'in_data' bus is valid.\n4. in_data: This is the actual data being input to the module. The width of this data can vary as indicated by the formula (SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT * BITS_PER_SYMBOL).\n5. out_ready: This is a signal indicating whether the downstream logic is ready to receive data.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. in_ready: This is a signal that indicates whether the module is ready to receive new data on the 'in_data' bus.\n2. out_valid: This is a signal that indicates whether the data on the 'out_data' bus is valid.\n3. out_data: This is the actual data being output from the module. The width of this data can vary as indicated by the formula (SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT * BITS_PER_SYMBOL). \n\nExplanation: \nInput and output ports essentially provide the interface for the stream pipeline module to interact with other elements of the design. Input ports are used to bring the input data, input data validity signal, clock and reset signals into the module. Output ports are used to send the output data and output data validity signals from the module to the rest of the design. The readiness of the module to accept or output data is interfaced by means of 'ready' signals from/out of the module, respectively."

If full0 is high, the register is full, if it's low, the register is empty.
