The main purpose of this module is to establish a debug interface for the system, thereby helping to monitor and control various operational parameters. In this module, input data is read and processed from different logic parts, like tracemem, dbrk, and monitor etc. The processed data is then output for further action like taking breakpoints, trace control, etc."
