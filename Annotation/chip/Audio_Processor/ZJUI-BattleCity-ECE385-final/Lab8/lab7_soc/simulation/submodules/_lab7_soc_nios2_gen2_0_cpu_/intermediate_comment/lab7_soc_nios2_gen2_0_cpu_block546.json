    "block_comment": "This block implements a synchronous reset and break control in a system using Verilog RTL code. It immediately responds to a negative edge reset event (jrst_n signal). When a system reset (represented by jrst_n equals 0) occurs, it clears flags for reset request, break on reset and JTAG break. Otherwise, when an action from the OCIMEM port is taken, it updates the reset request, JTAG break and break on reset signals based on specific bits of the input jdo. If a synchronous reset happens, it updates the JTAG break and reset latch signals accordingly. Lastly, when there's a pending debug request unacknowledged and break on reset is set, it asserts the JTAG break signal."
