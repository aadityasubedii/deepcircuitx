    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `xbrk_wrap_traceoff` based on the logical AND operation between bit 10 of `trc_ctrl` and `trc_wrap`. Specifically, `xbrk_wrap_traceoff` becomes true when bit 10 of the `trc_ctrl` register and `trc_wrap` are both true, facilitating efficient trace control functionality. This is a hardware-level operation performed in the Verilog design, ensuring high performance and low latency."
