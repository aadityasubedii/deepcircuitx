Comment: 
This block is responsible for updating the state of a status register, 'W_status_reg_pie', in a synchronous digital circuit based on the clock signal, 'clk', and the active-low reset signal, 'reset_n'. During the negative edge of the reset signal, the status register is reset (set to 0). In all other clock cycles, when reset isn't invoked (when 'reset_n' is not 0), the status register is updated with the value of 'W_status_reg_pie_nxt' at each rising edge of the clock.
