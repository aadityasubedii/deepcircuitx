The block enables the 15th FIFO based on certain conditions. The fifo_15_enable is set if either of the three conditions are met: 1) write pointer equals 15 and the input equals or exceeds 1, 2) if ge2_free is asserted (indicating that the input can be freely written into the FIFO) and write pointer plus 1 equals 15 and the input equals or exceeds 2, or 3) if ge3_free is asserted (another signal indicating the FIFO can be written into) and write pointer plus 2 equals 15 and the input equals or exceeds 3.
