    "block_comment": "The block is a conditional logic block with pointers for managing memory read and write operations in a Verilog code. It determines the `next_wr_ptr` and `next_rd_ptr` for the next memory cycle based on the current read and write pointers. If the `USE_MEMORY_BLOCKS` parameter is set to 1, this generate construct is enabled. The block adds 1 to the current `wr_ptr` (write pointer) and `rd_ptr` (read pointer), generating `incremented_wr_ptr` and `incremented_rd_ptr` respectively. The `next_wr_ptr` is determined based on the conditions `drop_on_error` and `write`, while `next_rd_ptr` is updated whenever a read happens (`read`=1)."
