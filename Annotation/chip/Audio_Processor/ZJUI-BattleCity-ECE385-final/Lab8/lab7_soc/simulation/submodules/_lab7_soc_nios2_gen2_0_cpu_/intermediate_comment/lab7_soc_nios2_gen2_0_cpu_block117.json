    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code assigns the value of the 'D_op_rdctl' expression to the 'D_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg'. It behaves like a continuous assignment statement in Verilog, meaning the right-hand side's value expression ('D_op_rdctl') is continuously monitoring for any change and consequently reflects the same on the left-hand side signal ('D_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg'). This feature ensures that the value of 'D_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg' always mirrors that of 'D_op_rdctl', allowing it to function as a critical control signal or status register in the design.\n"
