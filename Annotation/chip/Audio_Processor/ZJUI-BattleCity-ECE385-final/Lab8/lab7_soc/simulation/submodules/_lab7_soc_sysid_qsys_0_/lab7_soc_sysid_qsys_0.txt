Module-level comment: The lab7_soc_sysid_qsys_0 module assigns a fixed value to an output based on an input address. It contains three inputs (address, clock, reset_n) and one output (readdata). Although clock and reset_n inputs are declared, they don't affect the module functionality in the current design. The output readdata is a 32-bit bus, assigned the value 1639598322 if address is non-zero, otherwise zero. Implementation is achieved with a single conditional assignment statement.
