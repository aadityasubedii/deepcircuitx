Comment: 
This block is in charge of generating the signal `ge2_free`. The signal serves as a readily understandable condition indicating whether there is room in the FIFO buffer by checking if it's not full. This is achieved by performing a bitwise NOT operation on the most significant bit (MSB) of the `fifo_cnt` value, assuming `fifo_cnt[4]` represents the full condition of the FIFO buffer (i.e., `1` when full and `0` when not full). Hence, the `ge2_free` will be `1` (indicating that the FIFO is not full and thus free) when `fifo_cnt[4]` is `0`, and vice versa.
