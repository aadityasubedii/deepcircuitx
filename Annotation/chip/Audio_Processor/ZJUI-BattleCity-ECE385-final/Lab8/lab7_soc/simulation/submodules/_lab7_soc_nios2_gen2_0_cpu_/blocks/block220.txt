Comment: 
This block of code implements conditional assignment for the next shift/rotate operation result influenced by the current instruction and control signal. If a new instruction is signalled (E_new_inst true), it assigns E_src1 value to E_shift_rot_result_nxt. However, if the shift/rotate operation has to proceed right (R_ctrl_shift_rot_right true), it shifts the E_shift_rot_result right by 1 bit, filling from the left with E_shift_rot_fill_bit. If neither conditions are met, it shifts the E_shift_rot_result to the left by 1 bit, with rightmost bit filled with E_shift_rot_fill_bit.
