    "block_comment": "The given block of code implements a reset synchronizer chain. This design is utilized to pass a reset signal - 'reset_in', from one clock domain to another sans any metastability issues. Upon each rising edge of the clock signal ('clk'), the code chain shifts the reset signal through the 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain' array. Simultaneously, the synchronizer's output ('altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out') is updated with the value at the zeroth index of the array. The effective synchronizer chain depth is set by the macro 'DEPTH'."
