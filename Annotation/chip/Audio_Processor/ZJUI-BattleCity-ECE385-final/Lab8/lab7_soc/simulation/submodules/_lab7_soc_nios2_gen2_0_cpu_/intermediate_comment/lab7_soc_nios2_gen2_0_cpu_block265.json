    "block_comment": "The functioning of this Verilog code is to assign the concatenation of the high-order bits of 'F_jmp_direct_pc_hi' and bits 31 to 6 of 'D_iw' to 'D_jmp_direct_target_waddr'. This synthesis-time concatenation is used to compute the write address for a direct jump operation, a common procedure in hardware architecture involving program counter manipulation."
