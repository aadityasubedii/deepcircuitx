Comment: 
This block controls the right shifting and rotation operation in the data path. It takes several decoded operation signals (D_op_srli, D_op_srl, D_op_srai, D_op_sra, D_op_ror), and through a logical OR operation ('|'), it generates an active high D_ctrl_shift_rot_right signal when either of the operations is active.
