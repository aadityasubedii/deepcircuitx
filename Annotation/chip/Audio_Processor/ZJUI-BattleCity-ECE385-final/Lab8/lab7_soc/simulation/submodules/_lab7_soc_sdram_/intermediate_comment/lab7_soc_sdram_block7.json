    "block_comment": "This code block is a type of flip-flop that is sensitive to the rising edge of a clock signal and the falling edge of a reset signal. Upon receiving a negative signal on 'reset_n', the 'za_data' is immediately reset to zero. Otherwise, at each rising clock edge, 'za_data' is updated with the value of 'zs_dq'. This implementation forms the basis of data storage and transfer operations in digital systems."
