    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential circuit related to a 'refresh_request' signal in a synchronous system. On every rising edge of the clock or on a falling edge of reset (signifying an active LOW reset), it checks for the reset condition. If the reset is asserted, it forces 'refresh_request' signal to 0. On clock edges when the reset is not asserted, it updates 'refresh_request' signal based on the condition composed of refresh_counter being 0, current status of refresh_request, ack_refresh_request being not asserted and init_done being true."
