This block is a synchronous reset mechanism for a control register `R_ctrl_hi_imm16`. The logic is clock-driven updated only at the rising edge of the clock `clk` or falling edge of the reset `reset_n`. If the reset signal is active (low), the register `R_ctrl_hi_imm16` is reset to 0. Else, if the enable signal `R_en` is high, the control register is set to the next state value `R_ctrl_hi_imm16_nxt`.
