    "block_comment": "This is a flip-flop for the signal `i_read`. The block is sensitive to a positive edge of a clock signal (`clk`) or a negative edge of a `reset_n` signal. If `reset_n` is low (indicating a reset condition), the block sets `i_read` to 1. Otherwise, on every positive edge of the clock, `i_read` gets the value of `i_read_nxt`, therefore implementing a flip-flop mechanism. The `i_read` signal inherits the next state defined by `i_read_nxt` upon a clock event unless a reset condition occurs."
