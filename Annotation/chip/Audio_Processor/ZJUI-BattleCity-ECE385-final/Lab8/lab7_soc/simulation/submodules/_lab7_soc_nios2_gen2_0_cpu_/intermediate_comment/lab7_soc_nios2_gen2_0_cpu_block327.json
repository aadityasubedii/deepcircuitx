    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code determines which of the 16 FIFO blocks data should be read from, based on the read-pointer's current value. It accomplishes this via a 16-way unary mux, using the conditional ternary \"?:\", which checks equality between the read-pointer and each of the indices 0-15. If the value matches, the corresponding Chosen FIFO block's data is assigned for output. In the case the read-pointer exceeds 14, the data from the 15th FIFO block is selected as default."
