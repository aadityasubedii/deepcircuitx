    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code performs data alignment, specifically, it performs a right shift. It operates by using the AND operation between 'av_ld_aligning_data' and a condition. This condition checks if 'av_ld_align_cycle' is less than the two LSB bits of 'W_mem_baddr'. If the condition holds true, 'av_ld_rshift8' will take the value of 'av_ld_aligning_data', otherwise it will be assigned a zero."
