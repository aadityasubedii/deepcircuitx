    "block_comment": "This block of code manages reset synchronization in a digital system using a chain. On every rising edge of the clock (posedge clk), it checks for a set signal in the last element of the reset synchronizer chain (altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain[MIN_METASTABLE-1]). If it's set, the block resets the entire synchronization chain (r_sync_rst_chain) with a high signal (1'b1). If not set, it shifts the entire synchronization chain right, filling the highest bit with 0 while the rest of the bits receive the value from their preceding bit in the chain. Providing a form of reset signal padding for the reset synchronizer chain."
