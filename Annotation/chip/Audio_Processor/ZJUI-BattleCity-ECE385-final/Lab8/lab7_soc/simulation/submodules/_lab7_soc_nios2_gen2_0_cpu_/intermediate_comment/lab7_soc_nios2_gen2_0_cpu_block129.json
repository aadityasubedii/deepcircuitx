    "block_comment": "This block is used to compute the value of the control signal `D_ctrl_implicit_dst_eretaddr`, which might indicate the registers storing the return addresses after an exception is called. This value is calculated as the 'or' operation of a list of boolean variables (all starting with `D_op_`), each of which seems to correspond to a specific operation where an exception return might occur. Any '1' in these operations will activate the control signal."
