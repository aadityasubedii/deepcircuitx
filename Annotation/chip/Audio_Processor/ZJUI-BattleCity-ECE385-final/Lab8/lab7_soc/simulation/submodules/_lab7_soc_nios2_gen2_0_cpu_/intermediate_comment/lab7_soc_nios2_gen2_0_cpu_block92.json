    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is defining a combinational logic assignment for the `R_ctrl_logic_nxt` register, meaning that it will adopt the value of `D_ctrl_logic` whenever the clock changes. Detailed implementation can't be inferred without the whole context, but generally, this kind of statement is found in state machines, specifically the logic block responsible for computing the next state of the machine. The value that `D_ctrl_logic` holds after the execution of the 'always' block in its clock cycle will be immediately passed to `R_ctrl_logic_nxt` without any delay."
