    "block_comment": "The block assigns the read data of the control register, `E_control_rd_data`, based on the address specified by `D_iw_control_regnum`. The operation is achieved by series of ternary operator (`?:`) to map the address space to its corresponding register, which can be either the status registers (`W_status_reg, W_estatus_reg, W_bstatus_reg`), the interrupt enable register (`W_ienable_reg`), the interrupt pending register (`W_ipending_reg`), the CPU ID register (`W_cpuid_reg`), or the debugging register (`W_cdsr_reg`). If none of the cases matches, `W_cdsr_reg` is selected as the default case."
