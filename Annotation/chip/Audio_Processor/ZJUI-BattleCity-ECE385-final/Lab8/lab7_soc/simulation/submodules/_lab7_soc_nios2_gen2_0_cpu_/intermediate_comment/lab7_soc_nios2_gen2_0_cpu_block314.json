    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the signal `ocireg_sstep` the value of `writedata[3]`. This operation is done via an `assign` keyword, which continuously assigns the value on the right-hand side to the left-hand side. Therefore, whenever the value of `writedata[3]` changes, the value of `ocireg_sstep` will change automatically."
