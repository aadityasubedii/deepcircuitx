    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL covers the function of passing the value of the 'd_read' signal to 'cpu_d_read'. This operation is achieved via the 'assign' keyword to perform continuous assignment. It means the 'd_read' value will be assigned to 'cpu_d_read' whenever 'd_read' changes, making 'cpu_d_read' always reflect the current values of 'd_read'."
