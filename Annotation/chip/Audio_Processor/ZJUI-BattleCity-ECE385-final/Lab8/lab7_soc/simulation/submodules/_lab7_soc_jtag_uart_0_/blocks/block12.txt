This block of code handles various aspects of a FIFO buffer operations. It creates assignments for multiple properties of a FIFO register: 'fifo_EF' signals if the bytes_left equals zero, thus the FIFO is empty; 'rfifo_full' flags if the available bytes exceed 64; 'rfifo_entries' holds either the maximum of 64 or the value of 'bytes_left'; 'rfifo_used' takes the lower 6 bits of 'rfifo_entries' representing used entries; 'new_rom' is set to logic zero, meaning there's no new data; 'num_bytes' is set to logic '0', there's no available data; and 'fifo_rdata' which is set to logic '8b0', representing no available output data.
