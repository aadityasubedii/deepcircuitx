    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for setting the next state of the \"R_ctrl_jmp_direct\" signal, as indicated by the assigned current state of the \"D_ctrl_jmp_direct\" signal. This assignment operation occurs in the continuous assignment statement in Verilog, which means that the value of the \"D_ctrl_jmp_direct\" signal is continuously monitored, and any changes to it get immediately reflected in the \"R_ctrl_jmp_direct_nxt\" signal."
