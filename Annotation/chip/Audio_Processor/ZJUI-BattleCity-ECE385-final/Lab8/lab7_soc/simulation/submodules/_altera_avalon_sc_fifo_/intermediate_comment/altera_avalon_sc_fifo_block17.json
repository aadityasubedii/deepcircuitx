    "block_comment": "The block of code is used for generating a signal, 'almost_full_data', based on the condition of a threshold. It is implemented using a `generate if-else` construct in Verilog. If the flag, `USE_ALMOST_FULL_IF`, is enabled, `almost_full_data` is assigned with the result of a comparison between `fill_level` and `almost_full_threshold`. If the `fill_level` is greater than or equal to the `almost_full_threshold`, `almost_full_data` is asserted, indicating the nearing data capacity. If the flag is not enabled, `almost_full_data` will always be zero, basically disabling the almost full alert."
