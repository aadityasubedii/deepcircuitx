    "block_comment": "This code block is used to determine if a packet should be dropped based on certain conditions. The 'drop_on_error' variable is set true based on the AND operation between 'drop_on_error_en', 'error_in_pkt', 'in_pkt_error', and 'in_pkt_eop_arrive'. If all these variables/conditions hold true, the packet is marked for dropping. Thus, the 'drop_on_error' variable controls whether a packet is dropped in case an error is detected."
