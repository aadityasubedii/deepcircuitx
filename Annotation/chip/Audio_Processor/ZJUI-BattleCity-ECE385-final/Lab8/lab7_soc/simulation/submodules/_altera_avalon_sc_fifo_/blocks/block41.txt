This block dynamically handles the state of memory usage according to different conditions. It operates synchronously with a clock signal (clk) or a reset signal. The memory state is reset if the reset signal is high. When the reset is not high, and there is a disparity between write and read operations, the memory state is updated accordingly: if a write operation occurs, the current memory usage assumes the state of the previous usage, while if a read operation occurs, it assumes the state of the succeeding usage.
