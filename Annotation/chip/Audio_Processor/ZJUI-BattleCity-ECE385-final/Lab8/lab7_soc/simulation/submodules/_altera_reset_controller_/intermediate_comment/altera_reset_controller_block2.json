    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning values to reset_out and reset_req outputs. It uses value of r_sync_rst to assign to reset_out, and value of r_early_rst to assign to reset_req. The code block is activated on any change in the input, as signaled by the always @* statement. It exhibits a combinational logic behavior since it reacts to updates in its inputs immediately."
