This block of Verilog code controls the enabling of a FIFO buffer, fifo_3. It uses several conditions to perform this task. The FIFO is enabled if the write pointer is at position 3 and input_ge1 is high. Alternatively, it can also be enabled if ge2_free (indicates availability of another resource) is high, with the write pointer moving to position 3, and input_ge2 is high. A third condition for enabling is when ge3_free is high, with the write pointer moving two places to position 3, and input_ge3 is high. Essentially, the block manages FIFO buffer access and updates according to the available resources and current pointer positions.
