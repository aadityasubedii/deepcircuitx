    "block_comment": "This block of code is a custom log2ceil function that returns the logarithm base 2 of a given integer and ceil to the nearest higher integer. It takes an integer as an input and performs a bitwise shift left while incrementing a counter whenever the shifted value is less than the input value. This results in finding the log2 of the input and then ceiling it to the next integer, hence effectively implementing the log2 operation and rounding up to the nearest highest integer."
