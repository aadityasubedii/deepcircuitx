    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to determine whether to apply a stall in the shift or rotation operation. It takes into account various conditions such as the control signal for shift or rotation (`R_ctrl_shift_rot`), the validity of the operation (`E_valid`), and the completion status of the shift or rotation operation (`E_shift_rot_done`). If `R_ctrl_shift_rot` and `E_valid` is true and `E_shift_rot_done` is false, `E_shift_rot_stall` is asserted to indicate a stall is necessary because the shift or rotation operation is not completed yet while it's still valid and under the control signal."
