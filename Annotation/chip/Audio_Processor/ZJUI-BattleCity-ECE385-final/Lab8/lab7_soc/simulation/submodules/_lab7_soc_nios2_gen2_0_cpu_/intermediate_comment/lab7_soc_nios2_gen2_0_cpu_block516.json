    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for assigning the current state of the trigger_state signal to another signal called trigger_state_1. It accomplishes this using the `assign` keyword, hence every time the trigger_state changes, the change is mirrored in trigger_state_1 due to continuous data flow nature of the assign statement. The specific use of this can usually be found larger in a context, but it is a common practice for state mirroring or tracking past states in state machines."
