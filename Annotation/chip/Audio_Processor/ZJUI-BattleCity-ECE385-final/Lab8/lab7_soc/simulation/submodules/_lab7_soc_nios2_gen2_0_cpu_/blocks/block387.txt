Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code checks if a FIFO buffer is empty. It accomplishes this by checking the 'fifo_cnt' binary counter, which keeps track of the number of entries in the FIFO, and applying a bitwise OR reduction over this counter. If all bits of 'fifo_cnt' are '0', meaning the FIFO is empty, the reduction operation would yield '0'. However, it is then followed by a bitwise NOT operation, which inverts the '0' to '1', indicating that the FIFO is indeed empty. Thus, if 'empty' is '1', the FIFO buffer is empty, otherwise it is not.
