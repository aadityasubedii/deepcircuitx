Comment: 
This Verilog block handles synchronous reset and update of a register, `R_ctrl_shift_logical`. The block is triggered either by the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`) or the falling edge of the reset signal (`reset_n`). On reset (`reset_n == 0`), the register value `R_ctrl_shift_logical` is set to '0'. If not reset but enabled (`R_en = 1`), the value of the next register state, `R_ctrl_shift_logical_nxt`, is loaded into `R_ctrl_shift_logical` at the next clock cycle.
