Comment: 
The block of code assigns a value to `E_alu_result` depending upon a set of conditions. If `R_ctrl_br_cmp` OR `R_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg` is true, it directly assigns '0' to `E_alu_result`. If the first condition is false, it checks for `R_ctrl_shift_rot`, `R_ctrl_logic`, and `R_ctrl_custom`. If these are true, the `E_alu_result` gets assigned values from `E_shift_rot_result`, `E_logic_result`, and `E_ci_result` respectively. If none of these conditions hold true, it ultimately assigns `E_arith_result` value to `E_alu_result`.
