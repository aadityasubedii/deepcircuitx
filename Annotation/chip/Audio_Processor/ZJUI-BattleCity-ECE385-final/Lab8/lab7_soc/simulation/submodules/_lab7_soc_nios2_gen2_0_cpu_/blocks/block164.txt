This block is responsible for assigning the value of `W_wr_data_non_zero` to `W_wr_data`. It is implemented using the continuous assignment statement in Verilog, denoted by the `assign` keyword. The statement assigns whatever value `W_wr_data_non_zero` holds at any given time to `W_wr_data`, triggering a reassignment whenever `W_wr_data_non_zero` changes.
