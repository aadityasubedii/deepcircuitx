    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the enabling of a FIFO at the 12th position. It uses logical and comparison operators to check for three possible conditions: whether the write pointer of the FIFO is at the 12th position and there's at least one input, whether there's a free slot at the second position and the incremented write pointer is at the 12th position with at least two inputs, or if there's a free slot at the third position and the incremented-by-two write pointer is at the 12th position with at least three inputs. If any of these conditions are true, the FIFO at the 12th position will be enabled."
