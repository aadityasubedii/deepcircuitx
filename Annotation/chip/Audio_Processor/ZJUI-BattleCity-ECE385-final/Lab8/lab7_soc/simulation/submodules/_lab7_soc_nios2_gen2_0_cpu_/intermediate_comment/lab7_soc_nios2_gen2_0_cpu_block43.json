    "block_comment": "This block is a clocked sequential logic circuit, whose state changes with the rising edge of the clock signal or the falling edge of the reset signal. If the reset signal is active (logic '0'), the control state 'R_ctrl_st' is forced to '0', resetting it, else if the enable signal 'R_en' is high, it advances to the next state 'R_ctrl_st_nxt' during the next clock cycle."
