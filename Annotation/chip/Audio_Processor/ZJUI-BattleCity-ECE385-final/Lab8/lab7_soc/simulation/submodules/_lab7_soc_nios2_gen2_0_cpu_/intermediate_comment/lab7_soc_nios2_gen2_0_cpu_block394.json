    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the increment of a FIFO counter (`fifo_cnt_inc`). Depending on different system conditions, the code modifies the counter. If the FIFO is empty, the counter receives the lowest two bits from `input_tm_cnt`. If the third \nelement is free and `input_tm_cnt` equals to 3, the counter is set to 2. If the second \nelement is free and `input_tm_cnt` is equal or greater than 2, the counter is set to 1. If\n`input_tm_cnt` is equal or greater than 1, the counter is not incremented. If none of these conditions are met, the counter is set to a five-bit value, all ones."
