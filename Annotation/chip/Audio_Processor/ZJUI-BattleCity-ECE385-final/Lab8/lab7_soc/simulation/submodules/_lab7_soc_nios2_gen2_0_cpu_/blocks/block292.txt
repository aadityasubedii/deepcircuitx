Comment: 
This block is a synchronous block that updates the 'write' signal based on the 'clk', 'jrst_n', 'waitrequest', and 'write_nxt' signals. When the 'jrst_n' signal is low (0), it resets the 'write' signal to '0'. On a positive edge of the 'clk' signal, if the 'write' signal is high (1) and the 'waitrequest' signal is high, it holds the 'write' signal. If the 'waitrequest' signal is low, it updates the 'write' signal with the 'write_nxt' signal.
