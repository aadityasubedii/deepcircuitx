This code snippet assigns the two least significant bits from the `break_a_wpr` signal to `break_a_wpr_low_bits`. In Verilog, the term `break_a_wpr[1 : 0]` selects the bit range from bit 0 to bit 1 (inclusive) from the variable `break_a_wpr`, providing a mechanism for bit slicing. The operator `assign` minces that this operation will be continuously recalculated and updated whenever `break_a_wpr` changes.
