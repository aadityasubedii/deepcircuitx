    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for a data assignment operation in a register file in Verilog. The function named `R_stw_data` is assigned the lower 32 bits of the vector `R_rf_b`. This assignment is continuously evaluated, meaning the value of `R_stw_data` adjusts automatically whenever there are changes to the LSBs of `R_rf_b`."
