    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to control the logic operation that happens in a data path of a digital system. Based on the condition of the control signals `D_ctrl_alu_force_xor` and `D_ctrl_alu_force_and`, it manipulates the output `D_logic_op` accordingly. If the XOR force control is asserted (`D_ctrl_alu_force_xor` is true), the output `D_logic_op` is set to binary '11'. If the AND force control is asserted (`D_ctrl_alu_force_and` is true), the output is set to binary '01'. If neither control signals are asserted, it preserves the raw value of `D_logic_op_raw`. This block effectively allows manipulation of the data path's logic operation through control signals."
