The block of code is used to control the enabling of the 9th place in a FIFO structure. It works based on the writing pointers and conditions related to other FIFO locations. Particularly, it takes into consideration three conditions using logical OR operation: if the write pointer is currently at location 9 and there's at least one input, if there's room in the second location and the next position of the write pointer is at location 9 with at least two inputs, or if there's room in the third location and the position after next of the write pointer is at location 9 with at least three inputs.
