Module-level comment:

/*
 * This module implements the Nios II CPU core, handling instruction fetch, decode, execute, 
 * memory access, and writeback stages. It uses a pipelined architecture with control logic 
 * for instruction decoding, ALU operations, branching, and memory access. The module 
 * supports various instruction types, includes interrupt and exception handling, and 
 * provides debug interfaces. It integrates data and instruction memory interfaces, 
 * and uses both combinational and sequential logic to achieve its functionality.
