    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog outlines a synchronous FIFO behavior with synchronous reset. Upon the negative edge trigger of the reset signal (reset_n), the fifo_1 register is cleared to 0, thus it establishes the synchronous reset functionality. Post the reset stage, on every positive edge of the clock signal (clk), if the fifo_1_enable signal is active, the value at fifo_1_mux is loaded into the fifo_1 register, thus implementing a basic FIFO operation."
