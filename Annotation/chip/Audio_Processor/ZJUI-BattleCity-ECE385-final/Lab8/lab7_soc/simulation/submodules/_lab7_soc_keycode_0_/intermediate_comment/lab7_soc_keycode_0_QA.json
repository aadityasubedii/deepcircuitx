It has an interface of standard input-output ports such as address, chipselect, clk, reset_n, write_n and writedata for input, and out_port and readdata for output. When a chip is selected (=1), write_n is not active (~write_n), and the address is zero, data from the 'writedata' bus (specifically, the lower 16 bits) is stored (latched) into 'data_out'. If reset goes active (low), 'data_out' is cleared (set to 0). Thus, it mainly performs the function of data writing and management based on the applied conditions."

If chipselect is 1, data can be written, as long as write_n is low and the address is 0.\n3. clk: This is the system clock. The rising edge of the clock is used for latching the data.\n4. reset_n: This is the reset signal. When this signal goes low (active), the output data will be reset.\n5. write_n: This signal, when low, enables data to be written to the data_out register provided address is zero and chipselect is high.\n6. writedata: This is a 32-bit input data bus, from which data will be taken and stored into 'data_out' when write is enabled.\n\nOutput Ports:\n1. out_port: This 16-bit output is connected to the 16-bit register 'data_out'. It outputs the data that has been stored in the 'data_out' register.\n2. readdata: This is a 32-bit wide output port. The 16-bit data from 'read_mux_out' is 'or' concatenated to upper 16-bits of 32 zeros to form this 32-bit readdata. The 'read_mux_out' contains data_out masked by the condition (address==0).
