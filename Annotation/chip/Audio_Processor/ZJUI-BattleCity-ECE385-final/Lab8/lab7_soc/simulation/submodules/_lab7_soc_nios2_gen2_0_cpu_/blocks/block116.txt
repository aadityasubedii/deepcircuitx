This block of code assigns the value of 'D_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg' to 'R_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg_nxt'. This is a simple assignment operation, where the present state of 'D_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg' becomes the next state of 'R_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg_nxt'. It is a key part in a flip-flop operation where values are passed from one cycle to the next, usually forming part of a control logic or state machine design.
