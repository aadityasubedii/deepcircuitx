    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is designed to handle the read protocols for a specific test bench. When the reset signal (`reset_n`) is low, it doesn't perform any operation. However, when the edge-triggered clock (`clk`) is positive and there's a concurrent read request (`i_read`) bit with no wait request (`i_waitrequest`), it checks for invalid read data (`i_readdata`). If it detects such invalid data, it writes an error message with timestamp to the console and stops the execution forthwith for debugging purposes."
