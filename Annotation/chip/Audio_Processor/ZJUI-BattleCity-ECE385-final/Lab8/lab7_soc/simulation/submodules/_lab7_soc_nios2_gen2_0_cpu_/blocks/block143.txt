Comment: 
This line of code in Verilog performs a non-blocking assignment of the value of "D_ctrl_custom" to "R_ctrl_custom_nxt". This assignment occurs concurrently with other processes and is generally applied in always blocks, typically denoting places where registers are being driven. The particular value that "R_ctrl_custom_nxt" will take will depend on what data "D_ctrl_custom" is holding before the next positive clock edge.
