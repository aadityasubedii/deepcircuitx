    "block_comment": "This instruction block essentially assigns a constant low value (0) to the `D_ctrl_intr_inst` signal. This is implemented by using the \"assign\" keyword which in Verilog is mainly used to drive values into a wire. It assigns a digitally low value \"1'b0\" to the `D_ctrl_intr_inst` wire, meaning that no matter what condition or situation the code finds itself in, the signal `D_ctrl_intr_inst` will always be low which signifies inactive or off in digital schematic."
