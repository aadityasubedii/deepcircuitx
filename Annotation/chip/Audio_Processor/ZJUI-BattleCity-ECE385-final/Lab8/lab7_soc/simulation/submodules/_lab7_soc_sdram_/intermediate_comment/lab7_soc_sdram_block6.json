    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the assignment of the 'za_valid' signal in a synchronous design. On a negative edge of the 'reset_n' signal, the block resets the 'za_valid' signal to 0 for system initialization or reset sequences. Conversely, on the rising edge of the system clock signal 'clk', if no reset is active, it assigns the value of the third element of 'rd_valid' array to 'za_valid'. This is a typical implementation for a system's reset and data valid assignment procedures in digital design using Verilog."
