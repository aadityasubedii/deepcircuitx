    "block_comment": "This block of code is for assigning the value of the most significant bit (bit 26) of the F_pc register to the F_jmp_direct_pc_hi variable. It uses the slice operator in Verilog to extract the bit 26 of F_pc, which is then assigned to F_jmp_direct_pc_hi in a combinational logic manner, meaning the output (F_jmp_direct_pc_hi) immediately reflect changes in the input (F_pc[26])."
