Comment: 
The block of code serves as an interface that passes the value of 'data_out' to 'out_port'. It accomplishes this via an 'assign' statement, a continuous assignment statement in Verilog, which propagates the value of 'data_out' to 'out_port' in real-time. Thus, any change in 'data_out' is immediately reflected in 'out_port'.
