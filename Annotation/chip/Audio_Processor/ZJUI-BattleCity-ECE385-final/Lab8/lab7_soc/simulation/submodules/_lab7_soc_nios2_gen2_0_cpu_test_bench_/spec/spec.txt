Module name: lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_test_bench. Module specification: This module serves as a test bench for a CPU component in a System-on-Chip (SoC) design. It monitors and validates various signals and operations of the CPU, including instruction fetching, data reading/writing, and register operations. The module has numerous input ports representing control signals, data buses, and status indicators from different stages of the CPU pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback), such as D_iw, F_pcb, and W_wr_data. It has two output ports: av_ld_data_aligned_filtered (32-bit filtered load data) and test_has_ended (indicates test completion, hardcoded to 0). Internally, the module uses a large number of signals to decode and identify specific CPU operations (e.
