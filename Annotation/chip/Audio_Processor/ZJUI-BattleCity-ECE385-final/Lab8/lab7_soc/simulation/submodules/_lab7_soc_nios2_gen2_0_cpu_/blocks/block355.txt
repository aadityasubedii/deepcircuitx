This block handles the condition for a hardware FIFO (First In, First Out) queue. The clock signal updates its state at every positive edge and it also has a provision to reset during any negative edge. On a negative edge, if the reset is active (reset_n==0), the FIFO is reset, thereby discarding any data. If no reset condition is detected and if the enable signal is active, the FIFO is loaded with new data from fifo_8_mux.
