    "block_comment": "This block implements a clock-sensitive conditional logic with an error checking functionality. The logic is triggered whenever there's a positive edge on 'clk' signal or a negative edge on 'reset_n' signal. If 'reset_n' is 0, no specific operation is carried out. However, if both 'W_valid' and 'R_wr_dst_reg' are high, error checking on 'R_dst_regnum' is done. If 'R_dst_regnum' is undetermined ('x'), an error message is printed displaying the time of occurrence, and the system halts using the '$stop' command."
