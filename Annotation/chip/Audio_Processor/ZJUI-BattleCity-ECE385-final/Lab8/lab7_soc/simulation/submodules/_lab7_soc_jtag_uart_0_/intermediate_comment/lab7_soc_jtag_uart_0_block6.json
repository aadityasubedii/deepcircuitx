    "block_comment": "This line describes the logic to read a FIFO i.e., First-in-First-out queue. It uses active low read, address, and chipselect signals and implements the condition that the read should occur only if the chip is selected, a read operation is requested, there's no wait request, and the address is not asserted; all this while the FIFO is assured to be non-empty."
