    "block_comment": "This block of code simply assigns a 32-bit binary value of 0 to the variable named `exc_addr`. It's implemented using Verilog's 'assign' keyword, which allows for continuous assignment. The expression on its right side is evaluated continuously and the result is driven onto the left side, `exc_addr`. This operation means `exc_addr` remains 0 throughout this context."
