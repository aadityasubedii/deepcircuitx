    "block_comment": "This block of code is assigned to set a specific value to the variable \"dbrk3_high_value\". The function of this block is to reset or initialize the variable \"dbrk3_high_value\". The implementation takes advantage of a Verilog's \"assign\" statement, which continually drives the variable \"dbrk3_high_value\" to the given value, in this case, zero. This block is often used to ensure that the variable \"dbrk3_high_value\" is in the expected state before it is used elsewhere in the code."
