The block of code generates the enable signal for the system clock. It's implemented by using the bitwise NOT operator (~) on the `reset_req` signal, i.e., when the request for reset (`reset_req`) is asserted, `clocken` is de-asserted, and vice versa, controlling the functionality of the system clock.
