Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for control logic to set the source 2 of the 'R' type instructions and decide whether to use immediate value or not in a processor. The block is designed to be responsive to positive edges of the clock signal or negative edges of the reset signal. During a negative edge of the reset signal, the block resets the 'R_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm' to 0. However, during a positive edge of the clock signal, if enable signal 'R_en' is high, the block updates 'R_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm' to its next value, 'R_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm_nxt'.
