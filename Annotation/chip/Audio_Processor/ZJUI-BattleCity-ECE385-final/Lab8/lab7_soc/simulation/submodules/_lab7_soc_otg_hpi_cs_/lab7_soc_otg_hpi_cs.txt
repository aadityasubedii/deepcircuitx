Module-level comment: The lab7_soc_otg_hpi_cs module handles chip selection and controls write operations for a Host Port Interface (HPI). It uses input signals like 'address', 'chipselect', 'clk', 'reset_n', 'write_n', and 'writedata' to control its operations. Output ports 'out_port' and 'readdata' follow 'data_out' or the output of a multiplexer controlled by 'address'. The module uses an internal register 'data_out' to store data and wires for output mirroring and multiplexer controls. On every rising clock or falling 'reset_n', the module checks for 'chipselect' and 'write_n' signals to enable write operations and resets 'data_out' when 'reset_n' is low.
