    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional assignment statement to enable the fifth spot in a FIFO buffer. The fifth element in the FIFO, indexed as 'fifo_5_enable', is enabled when either the write pointer is presently at the fifth position and there's at least one input, indicated by 'input_ge1', or if the buffer has two spaces free, signified by 'ge2_free', and the write pointer sits at the fourth position with at least two inputs, detailed by 'input_ge2', or if the buffer has three spaces free, marked by 'ge3_free', the write pointer lies at the third spot with at least three inputs, affirmed by 'input_ge3'."
