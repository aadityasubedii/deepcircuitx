    "block_comment": "This block is a part of verification code that checks the state of the system-under-test (SUT) at every positive edge of the clock. If the system is not in reset mode, it validates the wire `W_valid`. If there's an `x` (which represents an undefined state in Verilog) on this wire, the block flags an error message and halts the simulation system, aiding in the detection of potential design flaws."
