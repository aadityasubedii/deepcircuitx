Module-level comment: The 'lab7_soc_otg_hpi_address' module manages address lines of an OTG SoC. It receives address, chipselect, writedata, and control signals as inputs. Upon chip selection, address zero, and write enable, the module writes the first two bits of writedata into an internal register 'data_out', which gets reset on receiving a reset signal. 'readdata', a 32-bit output with 'data_out' at its LSBs, and 'out_port', mirroring 'data_out', form output lines, providing the functional details of the written data.
