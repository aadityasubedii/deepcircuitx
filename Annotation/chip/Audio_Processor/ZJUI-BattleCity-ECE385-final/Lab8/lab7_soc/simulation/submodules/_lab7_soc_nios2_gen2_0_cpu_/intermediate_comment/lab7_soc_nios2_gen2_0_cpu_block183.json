    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a flip-flop or a latch in Verilog RTL which handles the data flow of `av_ld_byte0_data`. The flip-flop is sensitive to a positive edge of the clock (`clk`) or a negative edge of the `reset_n` signal. If `reset_n` is 0, indicating an active low reset, the data at `av_ld_byte0_data` is reset (cleared to 0). If not, on every clock cycle, `av_ld_byte0_data` takes the value from `av_ld_byte0_data_nxt`."
