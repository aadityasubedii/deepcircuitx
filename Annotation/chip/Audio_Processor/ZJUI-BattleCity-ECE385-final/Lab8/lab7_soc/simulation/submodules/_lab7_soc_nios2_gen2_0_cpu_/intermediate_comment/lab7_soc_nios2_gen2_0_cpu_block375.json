    "block_comment": "This block of code is related to the assignment of the multiplexer output for a given FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer. It leverages conditional logic (also known as ternary operation) in order to decide the value of `fifo_1_mux` based on various conditions. Initially, `fifo_1_mux` is assigned the value of `itm` if `fifo_wrptr` equals 1 and `itm_valid` is true. If those conditions aren't met, it then checks if `fifo_wrptr` is 1 and `atm_valid` is true, in that case `fifo_1_mux` is assigned the value of `overflow_pending_atm`. This sequence is followed by more similar conditional checks, essentially creating priority for situations where the FIFO write pointer is 1 or the incremented write pointer equals 1 with validation checks, changing the assignment of `fifo_1_mux` accordingly. The final value assigned is `overflow_pending_dtm` if all prior conditions fail to match."
