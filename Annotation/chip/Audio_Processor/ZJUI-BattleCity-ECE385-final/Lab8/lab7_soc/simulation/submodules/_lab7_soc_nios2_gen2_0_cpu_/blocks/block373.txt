The block of code defines a synchronous mechanism to handle a FIFO unit (fifo_2) in Verilog. On every rising edge of the clock or on a falling edge of reset, the FIFO unit 'fifo_2' is affected. If there is a reset condition (reset_n == 0), the 'fifo_2' unit is forcibly emptied by being set to zero. In the absence of reset, when the 'fifo_2' enable signal is high, the value from the multiplexer named 'fifo_2_mux' is pushed into the 'fifo_2' unit.
