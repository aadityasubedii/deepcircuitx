Comment: 
This block of code triggers or resets certain signal values based on changes in any inputs. When any input signals change, the `always @*` statement activates. It then assigns `reset_out` with the value of `reset_out_pre2` and `reset_req` with the value of `reset_req_pre`. The intent is to synchronize or latch these signals within the system based on the conditions expressed by the input signals.
