    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a bit-wise inversion operation on the `trigger_state` signal. The result of this operation, `~trigger_state`, is then assigned to `trigger_state_0`. This effectively means that whenever `trigger_state` is a logical high (or '1'), `trigger_state_0` will be a logical low (or '0'), and vice versa. This block could be commonly used to create an inversion or \"NOT\" logic gate functionality within a larger design structure."
