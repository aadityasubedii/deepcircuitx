Comment: 
This line of code is used for the assignment of a reset signal. It reassigns the value of the original reset output control signal (`reset_out`) to the value of the internal reset signal generated by Altera's reset synchronizer (`altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`). This ensures that the output reset signal aligns with Altera's internal reset signal for a synchronized reset protocol, reducing the chance of metastability in the design.
