    "block_comment": "The block named 'gen_blk15' is a conditional generate construct that checks if the macro 'EMPTY_LATENCY' is equal to three. If the condition is true, it begins the block gen_blk15. The logic written within this block executes only whenever EMPTY_LATENCY equals to three, allowing for flexible logic synthesis based on the EMPTY_LATENCY value. This is a way to generalize designs depending on parameterized values in Verilog coding."
