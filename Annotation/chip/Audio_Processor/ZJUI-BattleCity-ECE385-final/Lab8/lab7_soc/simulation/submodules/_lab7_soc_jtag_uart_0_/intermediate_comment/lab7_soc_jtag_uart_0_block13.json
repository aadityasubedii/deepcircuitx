    "block_comment": "The block manages the reading and updating of 'bytes_left' in a FIFO buffer. The block is edge-triggered on the rising clock and falling reset signal. On reset, the 'bytes_left' and 'fifo_rd_d' data are cleared to initialize the system. During operation, 'fifo_rd_d' is updated to mirror 'fifo_rd'. Conditionally, 'bytes_left' is decremented if data is read from the FIFO (i.e., 'fifo_rd_d' is true) or is set to a specified number of bytes ('num_bytes') when a new ROM is identified (i.e., 'new_rom' is true)."
