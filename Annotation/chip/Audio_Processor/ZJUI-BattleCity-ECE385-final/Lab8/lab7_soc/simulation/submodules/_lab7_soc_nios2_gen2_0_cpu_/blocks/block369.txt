This block of code is a multiplexer for a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) storage data structure. The multiplexer determines the next input data to the FIFO based on specified conditions. The conditions are dependent on the write pointer position of the FIFO (`fifo_wrptr` and `fifo_wrptr_plus1`), the validity of three different data sources (`itm_valid`, `atm_valid`, `dtm_valid`), and whether two or more data sources are free (`ge2_free`). The next input is selected among `itm`, `overflow_pending_atm` and `overflow_pending_dtm`, where the data from `itm` has the highest priority, followed by `overflow_pending_atm`, with `overflow_pending_dtm` having the lowest priority.
