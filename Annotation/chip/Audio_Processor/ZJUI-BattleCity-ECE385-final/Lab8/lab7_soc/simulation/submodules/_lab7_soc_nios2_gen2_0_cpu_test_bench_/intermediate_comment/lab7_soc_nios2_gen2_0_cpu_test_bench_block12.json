    "block_comment": "The provided code block plays a role in system reset and error checking under certain conditions. Upon the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk' or falling edge of the reset signal 'reset_n', the block gets activated. If 'reset_n' is low (0), the system resets; however, no action is specified for this reset state yet. If 'reset_n' isn't low and the write signal 'W_valid' is high, this block checks whether the bitwise XOR operation on 'R_wr_dst_reg' returns an undefined state (1'bx). If an undefined state is detected, it logs an error message with a timestamp and halts the system immediately."
