    "block_comment": "This code block is acting as a wire assignment in the Verilog hardware description language. Specifically, it assigns the value of 'm_cmd' to 'cmd_all'. This means that 'cmd_all' will always hold the same value as 'm_cmd'. This is achieved via an 'assign' statement, which continuously drives the variable on the left side ('cmd_all') with the value of the expression on the right side ('m_cmd'). It's a simple and straightforward way to propagate signals or conditions throughout the code."
