Comment: 
The block is implementing a synchronous flip-flop with an active low reset. The flip-flop captures and holds the value of `av_ld_byte2_data_nxt` at the rising edge of the clock (`clk`). However, when the `reset_n` signal is low, it asynchronously clears the output `av_ld_byte2_data` by setting it to 0 regardless of clock state.
