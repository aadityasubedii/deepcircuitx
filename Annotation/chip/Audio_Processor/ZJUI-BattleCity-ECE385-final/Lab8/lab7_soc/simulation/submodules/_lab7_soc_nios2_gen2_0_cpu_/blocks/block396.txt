This block of Verilog RTL code serves as a 3-to-8 decoder, with 'switch_for_mux' as the input and 'compute_input_tm_cnt' as the output. A decoder scans the inputs and, depending on the combination of the bits, selects one of its outputs, assigning it a value. In this implementation, the 'always' keyword indicates that the procedure is continuous. The 'case' statement maps the binary version of the 3-bit input signals to the decoder's corresponding outputs that will determine 'compute_input_tm_cnt' value, following the provided pattern. This case statement is enclosed within a begin-end block to indicate that it's a single, distinct procedural block.
