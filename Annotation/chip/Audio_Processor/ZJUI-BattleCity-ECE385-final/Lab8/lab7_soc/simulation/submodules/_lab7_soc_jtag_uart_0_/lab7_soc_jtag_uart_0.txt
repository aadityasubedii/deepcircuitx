Module-level comment: The 'lab7_soc_jtag_uart_0' module is a JTAG UART system that interfaces data reading and writing to FIFO buffers. It receives control signals as input to dictate read and write operations and system conditions. The design is divided into Read-FIFO and Write-FIFO sections, each implemented as separate submodules and orchestrated by the main section. Timing and operations are synchronously controlled by input clock and reset signals. Internal signals represent data flow, control, and interrupt management within the system. Output flags indicate readiness for new data and data availability for reading.
