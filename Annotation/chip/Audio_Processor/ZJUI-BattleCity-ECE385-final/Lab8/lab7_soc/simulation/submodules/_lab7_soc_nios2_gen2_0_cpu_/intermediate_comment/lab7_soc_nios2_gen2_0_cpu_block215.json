    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the lower 16 bits of array `R_rf_b` to the variable `R_sth_data`. This is achieved by implementing an extraction range [15 : 0] on `R_rf_b` and assigning the resultant value to `R_sth_data` via the `assign` keyword. The `assign` keyword creates a continuous assignment, meaning `R_sth_data` will continuously be updated with changes to `R_rf_b`."
