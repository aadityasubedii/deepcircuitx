    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is used for synchronous signal processing and flow control in a system. Initialized by either a rising edge of the clock signal (clk) or a falling edge of the reset signal (reset_n), the block manipulates the 'W_valid' signal. When reset_n is logic low (0), the 'W_valid' signal is reset (set to 0). In all other cases, 'W_valid' is updated to the result of a logical AND operation between 'E_valid' and the negation of 'E_stall' signals, which effectively sets 'W_valid' to true when 'E_valid' is true and 'E_stall' is false, advocating flow control."
