This block is a sequential memory element, functioning as a write-only, chip-selectable register. The register is active on positive edges of the clock or negative edges of the 'reset_n'. On reset, the output data is cleared to '0'. It enables write operation when 'chipselect' is high, 'write_n' is low, and the address is '0', with input from 'writedata[15 : 0]'.
