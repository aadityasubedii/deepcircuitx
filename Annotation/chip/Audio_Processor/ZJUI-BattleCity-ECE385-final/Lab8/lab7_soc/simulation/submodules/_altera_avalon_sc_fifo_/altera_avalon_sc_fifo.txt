Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable FIFO buffer for System-on-Chip designs. It supports features like multiple data channels, error detection, packet-based data handling, and fill level tracking. The FIFO uses parameterized memory (either blocks or registers) for data storage, with read and write pointers managing data flow. It includes logic for full/empty detection, almost full/empty thresholds, and optional store-and-forward functionality for packet-based data. The module also provides status and control registers for external management.
