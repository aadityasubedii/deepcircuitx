This block handles writing data into a two-entry memory. It executes at each positive edge of the clock signal if a write command is signaled and the memory is not full. Depending on the value of the 'wr_address', the 'wr_data' is stored in either 'entry_0' or 'entry_1'. If 'wr_address' is neither '0' nor '1', no action is taken. By controlling data write based on 'wr_address', the block implements basic write operations for a simple memory module.
