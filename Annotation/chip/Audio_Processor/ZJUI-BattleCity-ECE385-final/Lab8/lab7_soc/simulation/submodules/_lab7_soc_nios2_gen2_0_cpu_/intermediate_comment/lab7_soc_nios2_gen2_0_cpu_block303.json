    "block_comment": "This block assigns the ociram_addr based on the condition of the jtag_ram_access signal. If the jtag_ram_access signal is high (i.e., true), it takes 8 bits from the 10th to 3rd bit of the MonAReg register and assigns it to the ociram_addr. If the jtag_ram_access signal is low (i.e., false), it assigns the lower 8 bits of the 'address' to ociram_addr."
