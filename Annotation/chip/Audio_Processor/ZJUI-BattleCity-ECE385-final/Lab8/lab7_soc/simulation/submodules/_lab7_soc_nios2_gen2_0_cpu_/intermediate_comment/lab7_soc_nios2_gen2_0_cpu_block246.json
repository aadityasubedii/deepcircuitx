    "block_comment": "This block of code performs multiplexing operations for the R_src1 based on various control signals and validations for branch, return address, or direct jump. Essentially, this block is selecting the source value for R_src1 depending on certain conditions. If either 'branch' control signal is high and there is a valid path from R, or if the 'return address' control is high and R is valid, it selects the sum of the program counter plus one appended with '00. If the 'direct jump' control signal is high and there is a valid direct jump path from R, it selects the direct jump target with appended '00. Otherwise, it falls back to the value a of the register file."
