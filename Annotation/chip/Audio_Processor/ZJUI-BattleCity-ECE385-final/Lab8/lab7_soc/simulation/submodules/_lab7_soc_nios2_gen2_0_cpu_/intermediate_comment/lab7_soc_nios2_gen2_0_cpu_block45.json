    "block_comment": "The block assigns boolean value to the control signal 'D_ctrl_st' based on the logical 'OR' operation between several operation strob signals. The function is achieved through Verilog's 'assign' keyword which continuously assigns the result of the logical 'OR' between the signals 'D_op_stb', 'D_op_sth', 'D_op_stw', 'D_op_stbio', 'D_op_sthio', and 'D_op_stwio' to 'D_ctrl_st'. It indicates data control is active if any of these strob signals are high."
