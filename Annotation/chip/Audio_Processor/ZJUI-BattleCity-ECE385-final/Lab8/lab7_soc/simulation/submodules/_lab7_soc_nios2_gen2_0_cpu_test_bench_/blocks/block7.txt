The block of code primarily handles system reset and error detection associated with address lines in a CPU test bench. It is activated on a positive edge of a clock signal or a negative edge of a reset signal. In situations where reset_n is 0 (which signifies a system reset), no action is taken. But during a write or read operation, if the parity value of the address variable (d_address) is undefined, it logs an error message with a timestamp and then stops the execution.
