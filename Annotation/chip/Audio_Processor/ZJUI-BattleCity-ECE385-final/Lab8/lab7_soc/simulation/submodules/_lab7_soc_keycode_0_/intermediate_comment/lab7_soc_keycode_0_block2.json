    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of the OR operation between a 32-bit zero and 'read_mux_out' to 'readdata'. In simplifying the logic, the 'readdata' is assigned whatever value is in 'read_mux_out', because any 'x OR 0' will always return 'x'. Essentially, this block functions as a pass-through for 'read_mux_out' to 'readdata' with a specific focus on 32 bits."
