Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for managing the write and read pointers (wr_ptr and rd_ptr) of a memory buffer or similar data structure. When a reset signal is detected on the positive edge, both pointers are reset to 0. In the absence of a reset, on the detection of a positive clock edge, the pointers are updated to the next write and read pointers which are assumed to be calculated elsewhere in the code.
