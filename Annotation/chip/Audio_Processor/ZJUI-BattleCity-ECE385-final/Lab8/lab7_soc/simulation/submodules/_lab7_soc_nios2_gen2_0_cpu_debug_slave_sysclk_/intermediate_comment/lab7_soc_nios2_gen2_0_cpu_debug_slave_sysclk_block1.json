    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code is a clock-triggered procedural block responding to rising edges of the 'clk' (clock signal). When the signal 'jxuir' is high, it updates the 'ir' register with the value of 'ir_in'. If 'update_jdo_strobe' signal is set, it updates the 'jdo' register with the value of 'sr'. Both operations facilitate dynamic updating of crucial data elements (ir and jdo registers) subject to condition checks and synchronized to the clock signal."
