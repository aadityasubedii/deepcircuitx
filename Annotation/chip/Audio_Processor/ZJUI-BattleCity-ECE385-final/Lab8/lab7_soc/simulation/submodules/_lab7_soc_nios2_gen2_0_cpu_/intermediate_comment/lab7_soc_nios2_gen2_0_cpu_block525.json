    "block_comment": "This block of code is assigning a constant low logical value (0) to a signal (variable) named `dbrk3_low_value`. The use of the `assign` keyword indicates a continuous assignment statement which implies that any change in the right hand side value (0 in this case, which won't change) will trigger an update in the left hand side value, `dbrk3_low_value`. This effectively keeps the `dbrk3_low_value` always at a constant low logical state (0)."
