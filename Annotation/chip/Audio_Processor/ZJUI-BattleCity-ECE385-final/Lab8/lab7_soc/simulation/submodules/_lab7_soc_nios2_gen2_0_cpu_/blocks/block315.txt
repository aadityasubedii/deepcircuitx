This assignment statement in the Verilog code is setting the `ocireg_mrs` signal to the value of the least significant bit of `writedata`. Specifically, it copies the value contained in the 0th index (rightmost bit or LSB) of the `writedata` bus to the `ocireg_mrs` signal. This technique is commonly used in digital design for bit-level manipulation or condition checks.
