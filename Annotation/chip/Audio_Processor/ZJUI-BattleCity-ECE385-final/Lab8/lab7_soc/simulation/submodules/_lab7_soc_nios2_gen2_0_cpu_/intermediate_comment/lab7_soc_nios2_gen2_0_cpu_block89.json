    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for assigning the value of `D_ctrl_hi_imm16` to `R_ctrl_hi_imm16_nxt` in the next clock cycle. The operation is achieved through a simple assignment operation in Verilog, which transfers the current value of `D_ctrl_hi_imm16` to `R_ctrl_hi_imm16_nxt`, preparing it for usage in the upcoming cycle. This is essentially a connection between two signals in a flip-flop based digital circuit."
