    "spec": "Module name: lab7_soc_otg_hpi_cs. \n\nModule specification: The lab7_soc_otg_hpi_cs is a Verilog module designed to handle chip select and control write operations for a specific hardware interface known as the HPI (Host Port Interface). The inputs to this module include 'address', which provides the address for the memory operation; 'chipselect', an enable signal for initiating data operations; 'clk' which is the system clock input used to synchronize operations; 'reset_n', the active low reset signal intended to bring the 'data_out' to 0; 'write_n', the write enable signal indicating when data should be written; and 'writedata', the actual data to be written to 'data_out'.\n\nThe output ports are 'out_port', mirroring the 'data_out', and 'readdata' which accesses the output of a multiplexer controlled by the 'address' bus. The internal signals within the module include 'clk_en', a permanently enabled clock signal; 'data_out', a register storing incoming data from 'writedata'; 'out_port' a mirror of 'data_out'; 'read_mux_out', a signal which selects the value to be read based on 'address'; and 'readdata' which reads either 'data_out' or zero determined by 'address'.\n\nIn terms of operation, this module actively listens for changes in 'clk' and 'reset_n'. When 'reset_n' goes low, it resets 'data_out'. If 'chipselect' is high and 'write_n' is low (indicating a pending write operation), and the 'address' is 0, 'writedata' is written to 'data_out'. The 'readdata' and 'out_port' are then assigned their values from the 'data_out' or 'read_mux_out'; this depends on the value in 'address' effectively supporting simultaneous write and read operations. The design takes advantage of the single-clock, synchronous read/write operation paradigm common in hardware design. This module, therefore, exhibits a degree of complexity typical of such memory operation controllers making it a suitable building block for larger scale digital systems.",
