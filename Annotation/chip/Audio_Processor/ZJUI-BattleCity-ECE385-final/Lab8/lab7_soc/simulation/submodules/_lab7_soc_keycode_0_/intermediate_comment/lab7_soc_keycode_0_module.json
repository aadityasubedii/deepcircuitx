    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\n// The 'lab7_soc_keycode_0' is a RTL memory controller module in Verilog. It performs select write and read operations on a 16-bit 'data_out' register. Writing is enabled when 'chipselect' is high, 'write_n' is low, and 'address' is zero. The lower 16 bits from 32-bit 'writedata' are stored during these conditions. Reset operation is performed when 'reset_n' goes low. The module outputs 'data_out' through 'out_port' and 'readdata' - a 32-bit wide data that portrays the status of the 'data_out' register based on the address. Implementation relies on clock triggered events and conditional signal assignments."
