The block provides optional data pipelining for output data based on the condition of USE_OUTPUT_PIPELINE. To achieve this, it employs an instantiation of the 'altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base' component when USE_OUTPUT_PIPELINE is set to 1, configuring it with BITS_PER_SYMBOL and SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT. This component aids in processing data stream in a pipelined manner with its in_data, out_data, and accompanying ready and valid signals. If USE_OUTPUT_PIPELINE is not set to 1, the else part of the 'generate' statement operates, simply providing a direct assignment of incoming values to their corresponding outgoing counterparts, bypassing any pipeline structure.
