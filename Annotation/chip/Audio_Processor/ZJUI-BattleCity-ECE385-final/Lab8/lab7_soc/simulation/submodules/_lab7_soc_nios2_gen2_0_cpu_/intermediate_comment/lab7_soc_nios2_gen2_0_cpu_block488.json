    "block_comment": "This block of code determines if a break condition has been hit in any of the four monitored channels (xbrk0 to xbrk3). It achieves this by using the OR bitwise operation, which results in 'xbrk_break_hit' being assigned a true value if any of the four channels (xbrk0_break_hit, xbrk1_break_hit, xbrk2_break_hit, xbrk3_break_hit) flag a hit, effectively serving as a combined status flag."
