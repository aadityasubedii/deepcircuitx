Module-level comment: This module, lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_debug_slave_wrapper, acts as a debug slave wrapper for an SoC involving a Nios II Gen 2 CPU. Facilitates a debug interface to process inputs from various sources and control operational parameters. Inputs include data registers, debug breakpoint statuses, monitor statuses, reset signals, trace memory and trigger information. Outputs provide control over breakpoints, ocimem, and trace control. Internal signals manage registers, interrupts, and test data. The design involves two main procedural blocks: one managing the test clock (one managing interactions with ocimem and breakpoints via the system clock). These processes collectively provide detailed debugging and control functionality.
