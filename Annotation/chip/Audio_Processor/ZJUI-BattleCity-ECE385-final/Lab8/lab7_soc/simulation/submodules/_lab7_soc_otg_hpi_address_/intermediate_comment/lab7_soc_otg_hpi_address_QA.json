It takes an address input, chip select, clock, reset, write enable and write data as inputs. The module assigns the first two bits of the written data to data_out when the chip is selected, write is enabled, and the address is zero. If reset is active, the data_out will be cleared. The module provides readdata and out_port as output signals, where readdata is concatenation of zeros and read_mux_out value and out_port is the data_out value."

It is synchronized with the rising edge.\n4. reset_n: This is the reset signal for the module. When this signal goes low, the 'data_out' is reset to zero.\n5. write_n: This is the write enable signal. When this signal goes low, data can be written to 'data_out'.\n6. writedata: This is a 32-bit input for the data to be written to 'data_out'.\n\nOutput ports:\n1. out_port: This is a 2-bit output which holds the data_out.\n2. readdata: This is a 32-bit output which is the extended version of read_mux_out. The output is 'read_mux_out' combined with 30 leading zeros.  \n\nEvery signal has a crucial role in the working of the module. Inputs like 'address', 'chipselect', 'reset_n' and 'write_n', play major parts in deciding when and where the data ('writedata') is to be written.
