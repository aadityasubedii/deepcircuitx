    "block_comment": "The block performs a condition check for the control signal 'take_no_action_break_c'. It employs a conjunction of several conditional factors including whether the action strobe is enabled, if the instruction register has a specific binary value (2'b10), and particular state of the 36th and 35th bit positions of jdo (both have to be true) and the negation of 37th bit position of jdo which needs to be false. The result of this boolean logic operation is used to set the 'take_no_action_break_c' signal accordingly."
