This block is responsible for managing the fill level of a FIFO queue. It assigns the variable 'fill_level' the value of 'fifo_fill_level', which presumably represents the current fill level of the FIFO. In the event that the constant 'EMPTY_LATENCY' equals 3, 'fill_level' is recalculated by adding the output of bit concatenation (via {{ADDR_WIDTH{1'b0}}, out_valid}) to 'fifo_fill_level'. This implies that 'ADDR_WIDTH' zeros are inserted at the more significant end of 'out_valid' before it gets added to 'fifo_fill_level', affecting the fill level calculation based on the 'out_valid' signal.
