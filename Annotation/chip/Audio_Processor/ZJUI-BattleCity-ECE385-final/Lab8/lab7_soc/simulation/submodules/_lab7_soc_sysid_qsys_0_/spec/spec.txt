Module name: lab7_soc_sysid_qsys_0. Module specification: The 'lab7_soc_sysid_qsys_0' is a simple Verilog module that functions based solely on an input 'address'. It has three input ports and one output port. The input ports consist of 'address', 'clock', and 'reset_n'. The 'address' input is used to determine the value of the output 'readdata'. If it is non-zero, 'readdata' is set to a predefined constant 1639598322; otherwise, 'readdata' is set to zero. The 'clock' and 'reset_n' inputs are not used in this specific functional module, despite being traditionally significant in synchronization and reset in typical digital designs. The output port 'readdata' is a 32-bit wide bus that carries the result of the operation. Internally, 'readdata' acts as a wire that is assigned the output value based on the 'address' input. The main code body is a simple conditional assignment statement that assigns values to 'readdata' depending on the 'address'.
