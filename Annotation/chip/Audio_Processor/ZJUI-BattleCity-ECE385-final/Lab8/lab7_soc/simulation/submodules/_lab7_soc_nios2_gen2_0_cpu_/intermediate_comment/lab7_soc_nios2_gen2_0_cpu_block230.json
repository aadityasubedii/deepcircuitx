    "block_comment": "This block implements a basic logic operation unit that determines the type of operation to perform based on the value of `R_logic_op` and carries it out on `E_src1` and `E_src2`. If `R_logic_op` is '00', a NOR operation is performed, '01' effects an AND operation, '10' a simple OR operation, and by default, an XOR operation is performed. This is achieved through the use of conditional ternary operator (`?:`) in Verilog for the different cases of `R_logic_op`."
