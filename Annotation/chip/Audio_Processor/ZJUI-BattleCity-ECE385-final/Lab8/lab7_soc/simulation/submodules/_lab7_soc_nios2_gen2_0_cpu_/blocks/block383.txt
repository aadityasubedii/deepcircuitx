This is a clocked logic block controlling a FIFO (First In, First Out) memory structure's read and write pointers, along with its count parameter. In case of a negative edge reset signal (`jrst_n`), it initializes the `fifo_rdptr`, `fifo_wrptr` and `fifo_cnt` to zero and sets `overflow_pending` to 1. In absence of a reset signal, on positive clock edge, it increments the write pointer (`fifo_wrptr`) and FIFO counter (`fifo_cnt`) based on respective increment signals. The read pointer (`fifo_rdptr`) is incremented if FIFO is not empty. The `overflow_pending` is set based on FIFO state and validity of ATM or DTM signals.
