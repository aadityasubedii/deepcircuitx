    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a default value to a signal. In this particular block of Verilog code, a 32-bit signal named 'eic_addr' is being assigned a default value of zero. This assignment operation occurs continuously, meaning it will perpetually keep the 'eic_addr' signal at zero unless overridden by another statement. It is implemented as an 'assign' statement, a fundamental construct in Verilog intended for continuous assignments."
