Comment: 
This block of code is used to reset the states of `atm` variable and `dtm` variable synchronously on either the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`) or the falling edge of the reset signal (`jrst_n`). The block implements two conditional checks. First, it checks if `jrst_n` is '0', if true, it sets the values of `atm` and `dtm` to '0'. If `jrst_n` is not '0' (representing a non-reset state), it again sets the `atm` and `dtm` values to '0', indicating an identical action regardless of the reset status.
