    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value for the current 'SOP'(Start of Packet) pointer, `curr_sop_ptr`. If there is a write operation synchronous with the 'start of packet' signal and the 'end of packet' signal, the write pointer, `wr_ptr`, is assigned to the `curr_sop_ptr`. Otherwise, the last 'SOP' pointer value, `sop_ptr`, is preserved. This conditional assignment, controlled by write operation and packet boundary signals, allows tracking of the start point for the current packet in a data stream."
