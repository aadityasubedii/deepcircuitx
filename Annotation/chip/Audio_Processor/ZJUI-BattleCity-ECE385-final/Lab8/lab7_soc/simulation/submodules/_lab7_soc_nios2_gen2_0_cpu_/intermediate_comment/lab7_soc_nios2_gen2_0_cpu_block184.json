    "block_comment": "This Verilog block ensures proper functioning of the 'av_ld_aligning_data' data register by implementing synchronous reset and data loading design pattern. When a negative edge of the reset signal ('reset_n') is detected, the 'av_ld_aligning_data' register is reset to 0 ensuring a common known state for the system. During other clock edge triggers (positive edges ('posedge') of clock signal 'clk'), the content of the register is updated with the 'av_ld_aligning_data_nxt', hence achieving data alignment in sync with the system clock."
