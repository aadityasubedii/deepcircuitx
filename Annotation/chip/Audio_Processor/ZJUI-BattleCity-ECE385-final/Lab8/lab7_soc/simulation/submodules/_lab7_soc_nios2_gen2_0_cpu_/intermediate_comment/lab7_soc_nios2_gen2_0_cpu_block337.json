    "block_comment": "This block represents a sequential logic element in Verilog code responsible for handling the reset and enable conditions of a particular FIFO buffer named `fifo_14`. Upon a rising edge of the clock (positive edge) or a falling edge of a reset signal (negative edge), the block performs a check. If reset (`reset_n`) is active ('0'), the FIFO buffer `fifo_14` is cleared, effectively initializing it. If the reset is not active and the enable signal for `fifo_14` (`fifo_14_enable`) is active, then `fifo_14` will take the value of `fifo_14_mux`. This code controls the flow of data into the `fifo_14` buffer, either resetting or updating the FIFO depending on the conditions."
