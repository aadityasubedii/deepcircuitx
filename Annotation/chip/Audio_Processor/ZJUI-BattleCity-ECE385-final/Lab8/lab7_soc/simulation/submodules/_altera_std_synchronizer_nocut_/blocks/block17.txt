This block of code generates a random number in a synchronous way. If a reset signal (reset_n) is high (i.e., not reset), a random number is generated using a predefined seed (RANDOM_SEED), otherwise, it generates a random number without any seed, hence not a predictable pattern. The random number is then assigned to the 'random' signal at the rising clock edge thereby enabling synchronous operation.
