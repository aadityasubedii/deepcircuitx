    "block_comment": "This line of code in Verilog is used to generate a hardware breakpoint request (`hbreak_req`). The breakpoint request is produced either when there's an outstanding hardware breakpoint request (`oci_tb_hbreak_req`) or when there's a pending hardware breakpoint (`hbreak_pending`), only if the hardware breakpoints are enabled (`hbreak_enabled`). However, the request will not be honored in a particular case, specifically when the system is waiting for one post-branch return instruction (`wait_for_one_post_bret_inst`) and the waveform is not valid (`~W_valid`)."
