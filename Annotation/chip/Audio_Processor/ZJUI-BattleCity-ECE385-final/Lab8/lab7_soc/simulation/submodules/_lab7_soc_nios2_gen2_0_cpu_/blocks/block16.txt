This always block serves as a control structure for the `R_ctrl_wrctl_inst` register, adjusting its state based on the system clock (`clk`) and `reset_n`. Whenever the reset line is held low (`reset_n == 0`), the `R_ctrl_wrctl_inst` register is reset to 0. Then, on each rising edge of the system clock, if the `R_en` (write enable flag) is high, the value of `R_ctrl_wrctl_inst` register is updated with the contents of its next state (`R_ctrl_wrctl_inst_nxt`), hence effectively writing to it.
