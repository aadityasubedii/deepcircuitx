This block of code performs an arithmetic operation on two inputs, E_arith_src1 and E_arith_src2. It checks the value of E_alu_sub; if true, it performs subtraction (E_arith_src1 - E_arith_src2) and if false, it performs addition (E_arith_src1 + E_arith_src2). The result is assigned to E_arith_result.
