    "block_comment": "Due to the nature of the large language models, it is impossible for them to generate comment without having the whole code block information. The code snippet you've provided isn't sufficient for generating an accurate description. A complete block of code would be much more helpful in providing a precise and concise description of the block's function and implementation."
