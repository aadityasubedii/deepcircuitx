    "block_comment": "This code block operates as a synchronous control mechanism, initiated on a clock's positive edge or the negative edge of a reset signal. It possesses a reset condition to put 'E_new_inst' to a known low state, hence ensuring system stability. When not under reset, the block sets 'E_new_inst' to reflect the value of 'R_valid'. This block is of particular importance for synchronizing 'E_new_inst' with 'R_valid' signal within the larger design, specifically on clock's positive edge while considering asynchronous reset condition.\n"
