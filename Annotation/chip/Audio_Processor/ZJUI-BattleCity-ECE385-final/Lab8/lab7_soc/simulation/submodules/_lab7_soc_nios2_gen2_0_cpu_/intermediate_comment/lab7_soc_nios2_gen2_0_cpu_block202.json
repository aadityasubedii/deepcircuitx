    "block_comment": "The block of code is for a synchronous reset, where a certain operation is performed at the posedge of a clock or the negedge of a reset command. When reset is activated (reset_n is equal to 0), the `d_byteenable` is set to 0, effectively disabling byte operations. Conversely, if not in reset state (else clause), `d_byteenable` is set to the value of `E_mem_byte_en`, configuring whether byte operations are permitted based on the external memory byte enable signal."
