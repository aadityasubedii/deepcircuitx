    "block_comment": "This block of code handles various read and write functionalities of a JTAG-based system with a synchronously resetting mechanism. It operates with both positive-edge triggered clock and negative-edge triggered reset scenarios. In case of reset, all state-keeping variables are set to initial values. If reset is inactive, it takes different actions based on different conditions like 'take_no_action_ocimem_a', 'take_action_ocimem_a', 'take_action_ocimem_b'. Each of these conditions performs specific operations, updating registers and signals as necessary, thus controlling the flow of data in and out of the JTAG system. It also manages wait states during read/write operations. The timing and status of read or write operations are managed using control signals like 'jtag_rd', 'jtag_ram_wr', and 'jtag_ram_rd'. All these actions are done in a sequential manner based on the provided clock signal."
