Comment: 
This block is a D-type flip-flop with asynchronous reset. On the negative edge of the signal `reset_n`, the output `R_logic_op` is immediately set to 0, a process which is asynchronous to the clock. On the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, when `reset_n` is not in a reset state, the input `D_logic_op` is captured and held at `R_logic_op` until the next positive edge of the clock signal, implementing a synchronous operation.
