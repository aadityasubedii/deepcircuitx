    "block_comment": "This block of code regulates the behaviour of different debug signals based on the clock timing and reset signal. During a negative reset cycle, all debug signals are zeroed out for a fresh start. In normal operation (outside of a negative reset), the values of these debug signals are set by the bitwise OR of four debug submodules, thus reflecting a collective status of all debug submodules."
