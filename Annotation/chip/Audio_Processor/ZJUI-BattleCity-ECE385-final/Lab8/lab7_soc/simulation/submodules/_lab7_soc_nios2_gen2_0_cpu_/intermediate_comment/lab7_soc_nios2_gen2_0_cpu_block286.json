    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns a new value F_pcb_plus_four, which is derived from the value of F_pc_plus_one. The assignment implements bit concatenation, where a 2-bit binary value \"00\" is appended to the lower end of F_pc_plus_one, forming a wider bitwidth value for F_pcb_plus_four. This operation effectively multiplies F_pc_plus_one by 4, therefore this block provides a mechanism for incrementing the F_pc_plus_one value by four."
