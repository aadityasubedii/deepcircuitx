    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog primarily serves as a synchronous reset-handler and read command verifier under a clock signal. On detecting a negative edge of reset, the system state does not change due to a lack of implementation in the first sub-block. In contrast, when a read event ('i_read') occurs, the system checks if the address value ('i_address') is undefined (represented as 'x' in Verilog). If it is, an error message is printed indicating the 'i_address' is undefined, and then, it halts the operation using the '$stop' command."
