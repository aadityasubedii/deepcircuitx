Comment: 
This block handles the reset operation within a synchronous design. Executes on either a positive clock edge or a negative edge of reset signal. If the reset signal is active (logical '0'), the value in register 'R_wr_dst_reg' is reset to zero. If the reset signal is not active, the content of 'D_wr_dst_reg' is copied to 'R_wr_dst_reg', which occurs on the rising edge of the clock.
