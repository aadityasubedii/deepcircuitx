    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code checks if the current value of the 'address' variable is equal to the hexadecimal value 100. It is accomplishing this by using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog, which creates a continuous assignment statement for the variable 'oci_reg_00_addressed'. The condition for the assignment is a comparison statement that equates 'address' to the 9-bit hexadecimal value '100'. If the comparison is true, the value of 'oci_reg_00_addressed' will be set as high (1), otherwise, it will be set as low (0)."
