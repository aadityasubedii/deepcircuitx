This block of code is tasked with transferring signals in a sequential logic circuit in Verilog hardware description language. Specifically, it assigns value of the `D_ctrl_custom_multi` signal to the `R_ctrl_custom_multi_nxt` signal. This is done immediately and unconditionally whenever the `D_ctrl_custom_multi` signal changes. It is essentially creating a driver for the `R_ctrl_custom_multi_nxt` wire with a connection to the `D_ctrl_custom_multi` signal.
