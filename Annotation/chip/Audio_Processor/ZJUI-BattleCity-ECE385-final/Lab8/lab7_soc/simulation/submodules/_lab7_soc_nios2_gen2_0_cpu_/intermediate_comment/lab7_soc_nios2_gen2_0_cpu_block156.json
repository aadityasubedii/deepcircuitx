    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the 'W_status_reg_pie_inst' register for the next state. It does this evaluation by implementing a series of priority-encoded muxes. If either the 'R_ctrl_exception', 'R_ctrl_break', 'R_ctrl_crst', or 'W_rf_ecc_unrecoverable_valid' signal is high, it sets the output to '0'. On the contrary, if 'D_op_eret' is high, it assigns the value of 'W_estatus_reg'. If 'D_op_bret' is high, it assigns the 'W_bstatus_reg'. If 'E_wrctl_status' is triggered, it takes the least significant bit of 'E_src1'. If none of these conditions is met, it retains the current value in 'W_status_reg_pie_inst'."
