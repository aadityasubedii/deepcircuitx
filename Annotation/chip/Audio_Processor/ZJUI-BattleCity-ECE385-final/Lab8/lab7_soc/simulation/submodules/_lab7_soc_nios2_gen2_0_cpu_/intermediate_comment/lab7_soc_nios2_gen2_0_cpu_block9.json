    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is essentially used for conditioning the D_ctrl_alu_force_xor variable. The D_ctrl_alu_force_xor becomes HIGH or '1' if any one of the named operations is invoked. Specifically, these operations are comparison and branch operations where the conditions of greater than or equal, equal to or not equal to are checked. If any one of these operations is invoked as specified by their respective control signals (D_op_), it will force an XOR operation on the ALU, manipulating the control pathway within a CPU design."
