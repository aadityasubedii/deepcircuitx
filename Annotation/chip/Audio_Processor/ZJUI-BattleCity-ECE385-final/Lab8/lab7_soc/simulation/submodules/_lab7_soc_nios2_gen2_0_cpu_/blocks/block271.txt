This block defines the `D_dst_regnum` signal, determining which register number to use. It uses conditional operators (`? :`) to evaluate three conditions in a sequence and decide the appropriate value for `D_dst_regnum` based on the first condition met. If `D_ctrl_implicit_dst_retaddr` is true, `D_dst_regnum` is set to `5'd31`, but if `D_ctrl_implicit_dst_eretaddr` is true, it's set to `5'd29`. If both are false, then it checks `D_ctrl_b_is_dst`, if true, `D_iw_b` is selected, otherwise `D_iw_c` is assigned to `D_dst_regnum`.
