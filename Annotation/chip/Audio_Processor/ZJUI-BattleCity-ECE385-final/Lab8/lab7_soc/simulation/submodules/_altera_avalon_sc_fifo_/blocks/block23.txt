Comment: 
The block is used to either reset or update an internal counter that tracks the length of the current packet, `curr_packet_len_less_one`. The block is sensitive to rising edges of either the `clk` or `reset`. When a `reset` occurs, it sets the counter to 0. During the `clk` cycle, if a write operation (`write`) is enabled, it increments the counter. If the `in_endofpacket` flag indicates the end of a packet, it resets the counter back to 0.
