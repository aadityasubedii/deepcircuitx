    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for managing the reset and output conditions of a JTAG interface. If a reset is detected, indicated by 'jrst_n' being equal to 0, it forces the 'ir_out' output to zero. If no reset is detected, which is determined by a positive or negative edge clock 'tck', the 'ir_out' output is updated with the current values of 'debugack_sync' and 'monitor_ready_sync'. The block leverages sequential logic always block which is triggered on either a rising edge of the clock 'tck' or a falling edge of 'jrst_n' signal."
