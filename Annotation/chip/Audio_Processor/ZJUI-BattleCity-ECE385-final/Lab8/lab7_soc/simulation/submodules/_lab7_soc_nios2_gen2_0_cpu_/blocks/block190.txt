Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code is performing a bitwise operation to control the "av_ld_byte1_data_en". It uses a bitwise NOT operation (~) on a combination of an AND operation between "av_ld_extend", "D_ctrl_mem16", and a NOT operation on "av_ld_rshift8". The resulting signal "av_ld_byte1_data_en" will be high (ON) when "av_ld_extend" and "D_ctrl_mem16" are high and "av_ld_rshift8" is low, and vice versa.
