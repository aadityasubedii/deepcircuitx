Comment: 
The block is responsible for assigning the next value of `av_ld_byte3_data_nxt` based on certain conditions. Its function is implemented using conditional operations. If `av_ld_rshift8` is true, it assigns the current value of `av_ld_byte3_data` to `av_ld_byte3_data_nxt`. If `av_ld_rshift8` is false but `av_ld_extend` is true, it assigns the repeating 8 times of `av_fill_bit` to `av_ld_byte3_data_nxt`. If both conditions are false, it assigns the bits from 24 to 31 of `d_readdata` to `av_ld_byte3_data_nxt`.
