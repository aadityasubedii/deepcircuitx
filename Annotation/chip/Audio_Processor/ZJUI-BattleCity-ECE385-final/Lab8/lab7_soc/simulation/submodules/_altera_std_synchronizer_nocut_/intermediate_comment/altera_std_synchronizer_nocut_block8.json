    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a conditional construct to check if the reset value is zero and the depth is less than three. It implements this function using two if conditions, where the first condition checks if 'rst_value' equals zero and if this resolves as true, it then checks if 'depth' is less than three. This generate-if construct is used to generate the correct configuration during compilation time based on certain conditions."
