Comment: 
The block of code in consideration functions as a synchronizer to synchronize the input `in` signal to the clock signal `clk`. This is achieved by using two flip-flops that are connected in series, where the first D flip-flop (`ff1`) takes `clk` and `in` as input and the second D flip-flop (`ff2`) takes `clk` and the output from `ff1` as input. The output of the second flip-flop, `ff2`, is given as the synchronized output. The encoding of this synchronization process in a series setup aids in mitigating incoming metastability issues due to 'in' signal not being precisely aligned with the clock, a classic 2-flip flop synchronizer methodology.
