    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a synchronous resettable register. Within the digital system, this register's duty is to temporarily store or hold the binary information fed into it at the rising edge of the clock signal. The implementation employs an 'always' block conditional on the rising edge (posedge) of the clock (clk) or the falling edge (negedge) of the reset (reset_n). If the reset line is active (0), the register (dreg) is cleared, as reflected in the line 'dreg <= {depth-1{1'b0}};' where all bits are set to 0. If the reset line isn't active, the input value (din_s1) becomes the output of the register, as indicated by 'dreg <= din_s1'."
