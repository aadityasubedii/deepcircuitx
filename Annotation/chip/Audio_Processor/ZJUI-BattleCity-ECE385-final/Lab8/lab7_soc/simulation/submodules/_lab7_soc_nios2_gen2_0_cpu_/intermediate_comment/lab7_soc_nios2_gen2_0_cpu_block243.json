    "block_comment": "This block assigns a 2-item concatenation to the R_src2 variable. It concatenates the R_src2_hi variable and R_src2_lo variable into a single bit vector and assigns the combined value to R_src2. This means that it combines the high bits from R_src2_hi with the lower bits from R_src2_lo, and this concatenated bit vector forms the R_src2."
