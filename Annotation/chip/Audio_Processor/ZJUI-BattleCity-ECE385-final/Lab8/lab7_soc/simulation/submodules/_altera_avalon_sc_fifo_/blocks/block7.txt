Comment: 
The code block manages packet tracking and error handling in a circuit. It executes on clock or reset rise, resetting registers to start conditions on reset. If not in reset, it assesses the fill level and sizes of FIFO, and tracks the progress of packets. It increments or decrements the packet count depending on packet end-of-packet signals, while also considering packet leaving and error conditions. It manages start/end of packet flags based on signals from incoming packets. The block uses a synchronous design and enables efficient packet tracking and error handling.
