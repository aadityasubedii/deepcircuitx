    "block_comment": "This block of code performs the function of assigning a constant boolean value to a variable. The variable `is_cond_dct` is set to `1'b0`, which translates to a binary zero or false in a boolean context. This operation is performed at every positive edge of the clock cycle, as indicated by the keyword 'assign'. This assignment essentially initializes or resets the `is_cond_dct` variable to the value `false`."
