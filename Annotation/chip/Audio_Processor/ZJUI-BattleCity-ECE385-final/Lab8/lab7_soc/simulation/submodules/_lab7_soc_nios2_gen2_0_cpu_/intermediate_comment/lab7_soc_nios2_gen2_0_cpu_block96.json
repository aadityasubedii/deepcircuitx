    "block_comment": "The block of code is used for the assignment of control shift and rotate operation in a computing system. It assigns the 'D_ctrl_shift_rot' variable with the output of a bitwise OR operation across multiple operation control signals. These signals include shift left logical immediate 'D_op_slli', shift left logical 'D_op_sll', rotate left logical immediate 'D_op_roli', rotate left logical 'D_op_rol', shift right logical immediate 'D_op_srli', shift right logical 'D_op_srl', shift right arithmetic immediate 'D_op_srai', shift right arithmetic 'D_op_sra', and rotate right 'D_op_ror'. When any one of these signals turns high, 'D_ctrl_shift_rot' would be assigned a high value.\n"
