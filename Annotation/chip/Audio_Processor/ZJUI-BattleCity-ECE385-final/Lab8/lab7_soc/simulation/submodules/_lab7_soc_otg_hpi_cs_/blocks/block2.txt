Comment: 
This code block is responsible for data output control. The block activates with a rising edge clock ('posedge clk') or dropping edge of reset signal ('negedge reset_n'). Upon reset, the output is cleared to zero ('data_out <= 0'). If reset is not asserted and a specific set of conditions are met -- chip select is active, write is requested, and the address is set to 0 -- the output data ('data_out') is updated with the write data ('writedata').
