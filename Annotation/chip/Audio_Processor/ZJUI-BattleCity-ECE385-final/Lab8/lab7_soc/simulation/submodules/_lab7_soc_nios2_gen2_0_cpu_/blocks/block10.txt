Comment: 
This block of code implements a clocked register with asynchronous reset for the `R_ctrl_force_src2_zero` signal. Upon detecting a negative-edge reset (`reset_n == 0`), the register `R_ctrl_force_src2_zero` is forced to `0` asynchronously. Otherwise, during a positive clock edge (`posedge clk`), if `R_en` is enabled, `R_ctrl_force_src2_zero` captures the value of `R_ctrl_force_src2_zero_nxt`.
