    "block_comment": "This block monitors the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of the reset_n signal and performs different actions accordingly. Upon the detection of a falling edge of the reset_n ('0' value), it does nothing -- this is probably a placeholder for possible operations under a reset condition. Otherwise, if the d_write signal is asserted and d_byteenable signal is unspecified (1'bx), it issues an error message, displaying the simulation time and the specific information about the erroneous condition then stop the simulation immediately. This block serves as a monitoring function for the 'd_write' and 'd_byteenable' signal validity."
