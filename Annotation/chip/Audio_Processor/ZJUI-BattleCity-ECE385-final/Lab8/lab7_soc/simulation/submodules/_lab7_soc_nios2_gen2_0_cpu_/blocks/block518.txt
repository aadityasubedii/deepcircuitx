Comment: 
The block handles the state transitions for debugging triggers under different scenarios, driven by a rising clock edge or a falling edge of 'jrst_n'. When 'jrst_n' is low, 'trigger_state' is reset to zero. If that's not the case, two other conditions are checked: if 'trigger_state_1' is true and either 'xbrk_goto0' or 'dbrk_goto0' is true, 'trigger_state' is reset back to zero. Alternatively, if 'trigger_state_0' is true and either 'xbrk_goto1' or 'dbrk_goto1' is true, 'trigger_state' is set to '-1'.
