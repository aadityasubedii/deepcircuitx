    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a debug assertion, stopping simulation execution when certain conditions in a testbench are not met. It achieves this by initially displaying a message, \"Generated module instantiated with wrong parameters\", to provide a user-friendly alert about the error. Right after this, the `$stop;` command is executed to halt the simulation, giving the user an opportunity to correct the error before re-running the simulation."
