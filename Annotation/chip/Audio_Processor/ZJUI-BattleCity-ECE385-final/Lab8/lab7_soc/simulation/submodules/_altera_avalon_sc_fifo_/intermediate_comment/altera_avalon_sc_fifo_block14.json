    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for setting and retrieving the control and status register (CSR) values in response to events on a clock or reset line for a FIFO based system. On the rising edge of the 'reset' signal, default values are set for the almost full threshold, almost empty threshold, cut_through threshold, drop_on_error, csr_readdata, and pkt_mode. The values are updated according to the 'csr_writedata' input whenever 'csr_write' is high. When 'csr_read' is high, 'csr_readdata' is updated based on the 'csr_address' state, which selects the CSR element to read. The selection for addresses utilizes bit slicing and zero padding for bit alignment."
