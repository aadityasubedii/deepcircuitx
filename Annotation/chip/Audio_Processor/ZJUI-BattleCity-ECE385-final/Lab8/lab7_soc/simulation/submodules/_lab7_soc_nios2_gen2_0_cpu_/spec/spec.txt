Module name: lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu. Module specification: This module implements the CPU core for a Nios II processor. It handles instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and writeback stages of the pipeline. The module has input ports for clock, reset, data and instruction memory interfaces, debug interface, and interrupts. Output ports include data and instruction memory addresses, read/write signals, and debug interface outputs. Key internal signals include pipeline stage registers, control signals, and ALU components. The module is organized into several sections: instruction fetch logic, instruction decode logic, execute stage logic, memory access logic, and writeback logic. It also includes components for handling interrupts, exceptions, and debug features. The module uses a combination of combinational logic and sequential elements to implement the processor's functionality, including instruction decoding, arithmetic and logic operations, branching, and memory access. It supports various instruction types
