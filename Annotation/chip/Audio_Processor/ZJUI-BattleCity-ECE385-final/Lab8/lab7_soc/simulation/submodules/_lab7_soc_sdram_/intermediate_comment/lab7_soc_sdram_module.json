    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe \"lab7_soc_sdram_input_efifo_module\" module implements a FIFO buffer for data transfer between processes operating at different clock rates. It uses registers to hold FIFO data, manages write/read operations (triggered by 'wr' and 'rd' signals) and provides status flags. \n\nThe \"lab7_soc_sdram\" module interfaces with an SDRAM, controlling refresh timings, data reading and writing, and command translations. It uses \"lab7_soc_sdram_input_efifo_module\" for command queueing and employs internal signals and state machines for initializing SDRAM, and managing read/write requests. Status flags signal the state of SDRAM and data readiness."
