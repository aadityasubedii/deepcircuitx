    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs a bitwise OR operation on a 32-bit zero vector and the read_mux_out value, storing the result in the object named readdata. The implementation uses the 'assign' construct to make this result readily available system-wide in conjunction with the bitwise OR operator '|'. The '{32'b0 | read_mux_out}' directly depicts the operation, where '32'b0' signifies a 32-bit zero vector."
