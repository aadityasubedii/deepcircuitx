    "block_comment": "The block defines the maximum size of a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure within the hardware design. It achieves that by assigning the constant `FIFO_DEPTH` minus one to the variable `max_fifo_size`. This suggests the index for the FIFO structure starts at zero, hence the `- 1`, to create an appropriate maximum size."
