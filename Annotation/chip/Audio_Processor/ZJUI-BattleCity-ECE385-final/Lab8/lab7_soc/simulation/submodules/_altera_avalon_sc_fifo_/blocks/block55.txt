Comment: 
This block of code corresponds to a memory read pointer assignment in a Verilog digital system. Its function is to assign the read pointer for a memory block to the value of the next_rd_ptr variable, which determines the next memory location to read from. This is done using the 'assign' keyword, which is a continuous assignment statement in Verilog, meaning the left-hand side is updated whenever right-hand side changes.
