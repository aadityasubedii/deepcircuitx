    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code determines if the Avalon bus 'av_ld_getting_data' is in the state of reading data. It uses a bitwise AND operation between the 'd_read' (indicating if a read operation is ongoing) and the negated 'd_waitrequest' (indicating if the system is waiting for a request). The condition turns true and av_ld_getting_data gets high, when a read operation is ongoing (d_read is high) and the system is not waiting for a request (d_waitrequest is low)."
