    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code reads data payloads and channels, while configuring signaling flags for packets. It does this using conditional 'assign' operations, where certain bits from 'out_payload' are assigned to the relevant output variables, depending on whether packet, channel, empty, and error control are activated (`USE_PACKETS`, `USE_CHANNEL`, `EMPTY_WIDTH`, and `USE_ERROR` respectively). If not, they are defaulted to zero."
