    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a boolean value of 0 to the variable \"advanced_exc_occurred\". This is achieved through the use of the \"assign\" command in Verilog, which permanently sets the value of a wire, in this case \"advanced_exc_occurred\", to the bit value that follows, namely \"1'b0\" which represents a single bit 0."
