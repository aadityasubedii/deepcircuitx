This block is an assignment operation that enables the 'fifo_1' based on the certain conditions related to FIFO write pointers and input signals. The 'fifo_1_enable' signal is calculated based on three conditions: (1) when 'fifo_wrptr' is '1' and 'input_ge1' signal is high, (2) when 'ge2_free' signal is high and 'fifo_wrptr_plus1' is '1' and 'input_ge2' signal is high, (3) when 'ge3_free' signal is high and 'fifo_wrptr_plus2' is '1' and 'input_ge3' signal is high.
