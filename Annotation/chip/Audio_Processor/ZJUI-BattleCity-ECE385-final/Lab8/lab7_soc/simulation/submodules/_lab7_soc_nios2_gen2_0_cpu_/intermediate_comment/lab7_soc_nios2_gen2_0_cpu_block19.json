    "block_comment": "This block of code is a Flip-Flop with asynchronous reset feature in Verilog. It gets updated with the value '0' on the occurrence of a negative edge of the reset_n signal. Otherwise, if the R_en signal is high during the positive edge of the clk signal, it takes on the next value R_ctrl_src2_choose_imm_nxt. This flip-flop ensures safe control signal assignment even in an asynchronous reset situation."
