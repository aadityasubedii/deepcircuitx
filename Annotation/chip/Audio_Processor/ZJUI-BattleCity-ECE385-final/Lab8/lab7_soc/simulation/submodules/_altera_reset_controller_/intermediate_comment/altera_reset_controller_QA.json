It essentially manages the system's reset signal in synchronization with a provided clock signal. Detailed functionalities include managing multiple reset input sources, and optionally, multiple reset request sources. It provides flexibility by allowing the user to configure numerous important parameters such as the number of reset sources, early deassert time, minimum reset assertion time, and depth of synchronization. In addition, it has adaptive features to handle variations in reset request behaviors. Through this module, reset signals are effectively synchronized to the system clock, reducing potential hazards in digital design such as glitches, races, and metastability."

Depending on how the parameters USE_RESET_REQUEST_IN[0-15] are set, the reset request inputs may be used to additionally trigger a reset. The timing of synchronized reset and reset requests are kept in accordance with the system clock.\n\nOutput ports:\n1. reset_out: This is the output signal of the module, representing a synchronized reset that is propagated further into the system.\n2. reset_req: This is the output signal of the module, representing a request for reset that is propagated further into the system.\n\nExplanation: The reset_out is the final synchronized reset signal, which can be propagated to the elements that need to be reset. This signal is generated based on the input reset signals in accordance with the clock signals. The reset_req is the signal which indicates that a reset is requested, but it is not actually resetting the system. It might be used to alert other parts of the system that a reset will happen."
