    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code creates a wire (D_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16) which becomes high when any of the following operations have to be performed: 'D_op_cmpgeui', 'D_op_cmpltui', 'D_op_andi', 'D_op_ori', 'D_op_xori', 'D_op_roli', 'D_op_slli', 'D_op_srli', or 'D_op_srai'. The implementation of this block uses 'assign', a continuous assignment statement in Verilog, to perform this operation in parallel whenever there's a change in any of the input conditions."
