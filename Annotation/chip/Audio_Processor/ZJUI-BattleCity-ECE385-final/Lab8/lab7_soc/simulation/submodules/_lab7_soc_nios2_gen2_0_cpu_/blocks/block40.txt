This block of code governs the update of the control signal `R_ctrl_ld_st_ex` in a digital system. It is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal and the negative edge of the `reset_n` signal. If the `reset_n` signal goes low, it resets the `R_ctrl_ld_st_ex` signal to zero. Otherwise, if `R_en` signal is enabled, `R_ctrl_ld_st_ex` is updated with the value of `R_ctrl_ld_st_ex_nxt` at the next positive clock edge.
