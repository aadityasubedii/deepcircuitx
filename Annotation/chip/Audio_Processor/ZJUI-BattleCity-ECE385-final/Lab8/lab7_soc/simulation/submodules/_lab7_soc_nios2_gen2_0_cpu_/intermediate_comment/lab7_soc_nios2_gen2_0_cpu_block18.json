    "block_comment": "The block assigns the `D_op_wrctl` signal to `D_ctrl_wrctl_inst`. This is a straightforward assignment operation in Verilog, typically used for signal routing or renaming. `D_op_wrctl` seems to be a write-control operation signal from a decoder unit or a similar functional block whose value will directly reflect as `D_ctrl_wrctl_inst`'s state. Consequently, when there's a write-enable instruction in `D_op_wrctl`, the same would be reflected in `D_ctrl_wrctl_inst`."
