The block assigns the data from the E_st_data to the cpu_d_writedata. This is implemented using the assign statement in Verilog, which continuously assigns the value of E_st_data to the cpu_d_writedata, ensuring that they both hold the same value at any given time. The operation is carried out on the digital logic level reflecting hardware implementation.
