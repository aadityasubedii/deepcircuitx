    "block_comment": "This block is a multiplexer in a FIFO buffer that determines which data (itm, atm, or dtm) to write to the 13th position based on certain conditions. It uses conditional assignments (ternary operators) whose condition part checks the current write pointer status, validation flags of data itm, atm, and dtm, and buffer availability. If the write pointer is at the 12th spot and a specific data valid bit is set, that given data will be chosen. If the write pointer is targeting the 13th spot, and there are two or more valid data types, priority is given to atm and dtm over itm. The default output for this multiplexer is overflow_pending_dtm."
