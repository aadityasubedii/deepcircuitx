Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a memory management system. It initiates a synchronous process that triggers on either a positive edge of the clock or a positive edge of the reset. If a reset signal is triggered, the memory in index 0 is cleared. If the reset signal isn't triggered, the logic checks for write or read conditions. If write is signaled, memory index 0 is set as occupied. If read is signaled, and depth is greater than one, the current used space is updated to be equal to the next index; if depth is not greater than one, memory index 0 is cleared.
