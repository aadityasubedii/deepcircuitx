    "block_comment": "The provided block of Verilog RTL code initiates an asynchronous reset if the `ASYNC_RESET` condition is met. The addition of the `generate` statement invokes the reset for each generated instance of the block where the condition holds true. Note that the code for the reset logic and details of what is reset when `ASYNC_RESET` holds true have not been provided in this snippet. In essence, the code prepares the system for an asynchronous reset based on the status of the `ASYNC_RESET` signal."
