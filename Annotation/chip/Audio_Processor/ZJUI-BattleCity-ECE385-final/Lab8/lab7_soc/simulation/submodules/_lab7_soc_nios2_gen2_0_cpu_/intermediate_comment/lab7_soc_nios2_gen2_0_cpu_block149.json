    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the next state of the `W_ipending_reg_nxt` register. The assignment involves an AND operation with various signals: `iactive`, `W_ienable_reg`, `oci_ienable`, and a mask value of 32'b00000000000000000000000000000001. The result of this calculation will decide the new state of `W_ipending_reg_nxt`, thereby integrating several control signals and a constant into the upcoming state of this register."
