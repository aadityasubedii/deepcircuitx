    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code controls the recording of instruction trace based on certain conditions. The conditional signal, 'record_itrace', is assigned a boolean value whereby the 'trc_on' and 'trc_ctrl[4]' signals must both be asserted (i.e. each must have a value of 1) for 'record_itrace' to be asserted. This suggests that the instruction trace will only be recorded when trace is enabled ('trc_on' is set) and trace control bit at index 4 ('trc_ctrl[4]') is also set."
