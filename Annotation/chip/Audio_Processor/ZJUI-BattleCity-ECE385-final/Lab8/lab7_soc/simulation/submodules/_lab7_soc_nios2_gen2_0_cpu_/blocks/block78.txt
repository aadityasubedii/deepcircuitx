Comment: 
The code block assigns logical OR of several operation flags to `D_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot`. These operation flags are `D_op_roli` (rotate left), `D_op_slli` (shift left logical), `D_op_srli` (shift right logical), and `D_op_srai` (shift right arithmetic). The resultant line results in `D_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot` denoting whether any one of these operations are to be performed.
