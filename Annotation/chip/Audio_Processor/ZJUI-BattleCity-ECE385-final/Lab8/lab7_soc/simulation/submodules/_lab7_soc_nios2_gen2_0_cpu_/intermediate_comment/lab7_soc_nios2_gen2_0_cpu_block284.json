    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code manages an internal read request signal `i_read_nxt`. The signal is set if there is an incoming valid write request (`W_valid`), an unrecoverable ECC error encountered during a write request (`W_rf_ecc_unrecoverable_valid`), or the system is currently servicing a read but is awaiting a request (`i_read & i_waitrequest`)."
