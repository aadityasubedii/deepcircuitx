    "block_comment": "The block of code is implementing a synchronizer circuit. It accomplishes this by using Altera's standard synchronizer IP, which serves to align the `monitor_ready` signal with the clock signal `tck`. The synchronizer ensures that transitions in `monitor_ready` do not cause metastability when sampled by `tck`. The reset signal for this synchronizer is `jrst_n`, which is re-assigned to `unxcomplemented_resetxx2`."
