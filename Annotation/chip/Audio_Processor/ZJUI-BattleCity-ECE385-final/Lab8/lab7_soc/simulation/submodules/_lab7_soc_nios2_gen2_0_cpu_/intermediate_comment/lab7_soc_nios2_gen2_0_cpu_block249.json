    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a continuous assignment statement, with `R_rf_b` being assigned the value of `R_rf_b_q`. The function of this block is to ensure that the value of `R_rf_b` always matches the current value of `R_rf_b_q`. Every time `R_rf_b_q` changes, `R_rf_b` will be updated instantaneously, reflecting `R_rf_b_q`'s most recent value due to the continuous nature of the assignment."
