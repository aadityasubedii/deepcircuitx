It operates by transferring data from one domain to the other in a manner that ensures data integrity and order. It uses Altera's standard synchronization module and pipeline processing for managing the data transfer process, all while allowing adjustable synchronization depth and customizable data width. In addition to that, it incorporates facilities for the input and output data to be controlled in terms of readiness and validity, ensuring smooth and controlled data transfer across clock domains."

The clock and reset signals are used to control the timing and initialization of the module. `in_ready` and `in_valid` signals are used to control the flow of input data, where `in_ready` shows the readiness of the buffer to receive new data and `in_valid` indicates if the existing data is ready for processing or not. The `in_data` is the actual multi-bit data that is being transferred.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. `out_ready`: This signal indicates that the data has been processed and is ready to be output.\n2. `out_valid`: This signal indicates when the output data is valid and can be read.\n3. `out_data`: This is the data output signal (multi-bit).\n\nExplanation: The output ports are used to provide signals and data out of the module. After the input data has been processed, the `out_ready` signal goes high to indicate that the module is ready to put out data. Similarly, the `out_valid` signal goes high to indicate when it\u2019s valid to read the output data. The `out_data` is the actual data that is sent out from the system after being processed."
