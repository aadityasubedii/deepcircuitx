It uses a pipelined architecture with control logic \n * for instruction decoding, ALU operations, branching, and memory access. The module \n * supports various instruction types, includes interrupt and exception handling, and \n * provides debug interfaces. It integrates data and instruction memory interfaces, \n * and uses both combinational and sequential logic to achieve its functionality.\n */"
