This block is designed to detect and display metastable events in digital logic. It functions in synthesizable RTL code, comparing the input data 'din' with its previous value 'din_last', and a random value 'random'. If 'reset_n' is active, and 'din' is unequal to both 'din_last' and 'random', this condition signifies a potential metastable event. Upon detection, the module gives a display output detailing the event occurrence and the corresponding timestamp, then triggers the 'metastable_event' named event for further handling of the scenario.
