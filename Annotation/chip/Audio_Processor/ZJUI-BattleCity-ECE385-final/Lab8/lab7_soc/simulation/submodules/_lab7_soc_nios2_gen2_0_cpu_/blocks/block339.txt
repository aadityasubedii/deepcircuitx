The function of this block is to determine the value of the `fifo_13_mux` based on various conditions. It uses a form of priority encoding to select between different sources of data (`itm`, `overflow_pending_atm` and `overflow_pending_dtm`), dependent on the states of write pointers (`fifo_wrptr` and `fifo_wrptr_plus1`), validation flags (`itm_valid`, `atm_valid`, `dtm_valid`), and the flag for more than two free positions (`ge2_free`). The highest priority is given to `itm`, then to `overflow_pending_atm` and finally to `overflow_pending_dtm`, in the event of a write pointer being at position 13. This is then followed by conditions checking if write pointer with an increment of one is at position 13 and more than two positions in the FIFO are free.
