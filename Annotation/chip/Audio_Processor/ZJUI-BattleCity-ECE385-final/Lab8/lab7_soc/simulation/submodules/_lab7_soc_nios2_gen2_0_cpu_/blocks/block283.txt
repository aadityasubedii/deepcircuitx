The block of code is assigning a concatenated value to `i_address`. It achieves this by utilizing Verilog's concatenation operator to join the value of `F_pc` and a 2-bit binary number `00`. The `{F_pc, 2'b00}` operation combines these two pieces of data to form a new, broader value which is then assigned to `i_address`.
