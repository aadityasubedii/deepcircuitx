    "block_comment": "This block assigns a constant Boolean value, specifically `1'b0` or logical `0`. It essentially initializes or resets the wire `dbrk3_trigout`. This operation of the block is achieved through simple Verilog `assign` statement, which continuously assigns the value of the expression on the right side (here `1'b0`) to the left side net (`dbrk3_trigout`)."
