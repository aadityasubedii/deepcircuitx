    "block_comment": "This block initializes and updates a control register, `R_ctrl_logic`, in a synchronous manner. During the event of either a positive edge of clock signal `clk` or a negative edge of active low reset signal `reset_n`, the block assigns new values to the control register. If `reset_n` is low (indicating reset state), the control register is forcefully initialized to 0. Otherwise, when the `R_en` signal is true, the control register takes the value of `R_ctrl_logic_nxt`."
