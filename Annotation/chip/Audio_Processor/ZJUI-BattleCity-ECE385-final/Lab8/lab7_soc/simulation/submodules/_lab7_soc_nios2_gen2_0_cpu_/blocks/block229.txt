Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is used to create a signal (E_logic_result_is_0) which will be assertive (true or 1) when E_logic_result is zero. The code declares 'E_logic_result_is_0' using 'assign', which makes it a continuous assignment. This means any change in 'E_logic_result' will immediately cause a change in 'E_logic_result_is_0'. Equal operator (==) is used here to check equivalence between 'E_logic_result' and 0.
