    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating the state of the 'R_ctrl_intr_inst' signal in the next clock cycle. It achieves its function by directly assigning the current state of the 'D_ctrl_intr_inst' signal to the 'R_ctrl_intr_inst_nxt' signal. Specifically, the 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements, which are used to declare nets and implicitly declare and assign values to wires."
