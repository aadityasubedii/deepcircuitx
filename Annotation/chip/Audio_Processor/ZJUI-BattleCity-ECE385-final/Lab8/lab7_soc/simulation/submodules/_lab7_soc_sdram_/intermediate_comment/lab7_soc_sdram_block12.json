    "block_comment": "This block is a state machine managing memory refresh operations. This operation is clock-driven, with logic reset when `reset_n` is 0 driving variables to their initial states. On each clock cycle (`posedge clk`), the state transitions and cascades variables (`i_state`, `i_next`, `i_cmd`, `i_addr`, `i_refs`, `i_count`) to their next values in response to conditions such as the status of `refresh_counter` or `i_refs`. There are various states (`3'b000`, `3'b001`, `3'b010`, `3'b011`, `3'b101`, `3'b111`), each corresponding to different logic with unique command codes and variable manipulations. Cases such as `i_count > 1` or `i_refs == 3'h1` instruct specific transitions based on the counters used. Defaults are in place to define behavior outside specified cases."
