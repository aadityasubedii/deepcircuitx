Comment: 
This block of code implements a synchronous reset structure with a flip flop memory for the 'W_rf_ecc_unrecoverable_valid' signal. It uses a reset-active-low signal and it is triggered on every positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal. When 'reset_n' is pulled low, the 'W_rf_ecc_unrecoverable_valid' signal will be reset to 0. Else, the 'W_rf_ecc_unrecoverable_valid' is updated with the logic and operation between 'E_rf_ecc_unrecoverable_valid' and the inverted value of 'E_rf_ecc_recoverable_valid'.
