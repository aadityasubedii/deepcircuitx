    "block_comment": "This block of RTL code in Verilog is used for writing the control status. The write operation occurs when `R_ctrl_wrctl_inst` signal is asserted and the control register number (`D_iw_control_regnum`) is set to two, denoted by `5'd2`. Implementing a bitwise AND operation, the block returns true to assign to `E_wrctl_bstatus` only when both conditions are met."
