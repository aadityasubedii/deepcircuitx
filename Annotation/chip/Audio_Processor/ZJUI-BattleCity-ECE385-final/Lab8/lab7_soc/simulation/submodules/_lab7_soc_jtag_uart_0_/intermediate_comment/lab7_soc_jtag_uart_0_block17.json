    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily setting default values for different variables. The variable `wfifo_used` is assigned a 6-bit binary value of zeroes, indicating the FIFO (First in, First out) write data buffer is not used. The `r_dat` variable is set to an 8-bit binary value of zeroes denoting the read data is currently empty. The `fifo_FF` variable is set to `0`, suggesting the flip flop of the FIFO is inactive. Lastly, `wfifo_empty` is set to `1`, indicating the write data buffer of FIFO is empty."
