This block performs a comparison operation on the value of the variable 'address'. It checks whether 'address' exactly matches the value 9'h101 (a hexadecimal number). The result of this comparison is assigned to the variable 'oci_reg_01_addressed'. If 'address' equals 9'h101, 'oci_reg_01_addressed' will be set to '1' (or True), otherwise, it's set to '0' (or False).
