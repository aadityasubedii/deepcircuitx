    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the input read data to the wire F_av_iw. The 'assign' keyword is used here for continuous assignment of the 'i_readdata' to the wire 'F_av_iw'. The assignment is carried out whenever there is any change in 'i_readdata', thus ensuring 'F_av_iw' always reflects the current value of 'i_readdata'.\n"
