    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a synchronous reset mechanism in a Verilog design. The process is sensitive to both a positive edge of the clock signal 'clk' and a negative edge of the reset signal 'reset_n'. When a reset event is detected, i.e., 'reset_n' is 0, the module forces the 'R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br' register to a known value, 0. However, during normal operation when 'reset_n' is not 0 and the 'R_en' signal is high, the 'R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br' register is updated with the value of 'R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br_nxt' value on each rising edge of 'clk'."
