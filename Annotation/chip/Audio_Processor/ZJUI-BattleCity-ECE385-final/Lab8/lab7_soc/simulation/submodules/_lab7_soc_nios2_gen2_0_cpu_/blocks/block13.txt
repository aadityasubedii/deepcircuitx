This block is responsible for the synchronous reset and update of the `R_ctrl_intr_inst` signal. This signal is asynchronously reset to 0 when the active low reset (`reset_n`) is applied. However, during each positive edge of the clock when the reset is not active, if the `R_en` (Read enable) signal is asserted, the current state of `R_ctrl_intr_inst` will be updated to the next state, denoted by `R_ctrl_intr_inst_nxt`.
