    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is defining a constant signal called `dbrk2_high_value` and assigning it a constant value of 0. As the operator \"assign\" implies, the value being assigned is hardwired, meaning it can't be modified elsewhere in the code. This sets up a digital logic scenario where `dbrk2_high_value` will always have a logical low value or be \"off,\" regardless of other actions or changes within the digital system."
