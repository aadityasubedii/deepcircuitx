Comment: 
This block of Verilog code acts as a synchronously resettable buffer system for incoming data. During each rise of the input clock (in_clk) or input reset signal (in_reset), the logic within this block is executed. If the reset signal is active, it clears the data buffer (in_data_buffer) and resets the toggle flag (in_data_toggle) to 0. If the reset is not active but the "take_in_data" signal is, the buffer is updated with new input data (in_data) and the toggle flag is complemented for indicating a new data's arrival.
