Comment: 
This block performs a synchronous reset and data write operation in a digital logic circuit. At the negative edge of the 'reset_n' signal or on the positive edge of the clock signal 'clk', it resets the 'd_write' register by setting it to 0 if 'reset_n' is 0, otherwise it updates 'd_write' with the value of 'd_write_nxt'.
