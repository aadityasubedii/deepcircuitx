This hardware block serves as a basic data buffer or temporary data storage. By utilizing a memory array `mem` and pointers `wr_ptr` and `mem_rd_ptr`, it functions by storing `in_payload` input data into the memory array upon positive edge of the clock and when both `in_valid` and `in_ready` signals are high. Simultaneously, the block fetches data from the memory array to `internal_out_payload` based on the read pointer `mem_rd_ptr` indicating the memory address to be read.
