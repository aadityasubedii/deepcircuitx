This block of code implements a synchronous reset and asynchronous update of the 'R_ctrl_custom' register. This is achieved by always triggering the block on the rising edge of the clock ('clk') or the falling edge of the asynchronous reset signal ('reset_n'). If 'reset_n' is zero, a reset operation is signified and 'R_ctrl_custom' is set to zero. If the reset is not active and a enable signal ('R_en') is active, the value of 'R_ctrl_custom_nxt' is latch into 'R_ctrl_custom' at the next clock edge.
