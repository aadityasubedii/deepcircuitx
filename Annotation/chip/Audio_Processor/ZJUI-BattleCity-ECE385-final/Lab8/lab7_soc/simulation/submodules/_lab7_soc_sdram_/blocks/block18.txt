This block of code defines how the various signal assignments are performed in a specific memory control system. The clk_en signal is constantly enabled. The memory command signal m_cmd is mapped directly to the chip select (zs_cs_n), row address strobe (zs_ras_n), column address strobe (zs_cas_n), and write enable (zs_we_n) signals. Similarly, the memory address m_addr, data m_data, data mask m_dqm, and bank address m_bank are assigned directly to zs_addr, zs_dq, zs_dqm, and zs_ba respectively. The memory data line zs_dq is conditionally assigned based on the output enable signal oe. Also, the frame select (f_select) signal is designed as a logical AND between the frame pop (f_pop) and pending signals. This effectively controls the selection of frames based on their pending status.
