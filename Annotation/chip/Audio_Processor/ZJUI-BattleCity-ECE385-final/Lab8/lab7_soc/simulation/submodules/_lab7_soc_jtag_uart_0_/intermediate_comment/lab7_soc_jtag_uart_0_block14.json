    "block_comment": "This block defines the registers and wires required for handling a FIFO and ROM operation. It establishes a 32-bit register for tracking remaining bytes (`bytes_left`) and a single bit register for a FIFO read operation (`fifo_rd_d`). It also sets up multiple wires: `fifo_EF` for checking a FIFO empty flag, `fifo_rdata` as an 8-bit bus for FIFO read data, `new_rom` for indicating a ROM fetch, `num_bytes` a 32-bit which holds the number of bytes left, `rfifo_entries` is a 7-bit bus for the number of FIFO entries, `rfifo_full` a single bit for FIFO full flag and `rfifo_used` which is 6-bit wide for used FIFO entries."
