This block of code initializes or updates the value of a wire `W_cmp_result`. It does this by monitoring rising edge of system clock (clk) or the falling edge of `reset_n`. When `reset_n` is not active (high state), the value of `E_cmp_result` is transferred to `W_cmp_result`. This way, it conducts a latch operation, where the `E_cmp_result` value is latched onto `W_cmp_result` at each clock cycle. However, if `reset_n` is active (low state), this block forces `W_cmp_result` to be zero, effectively performing a synchronous reset.
