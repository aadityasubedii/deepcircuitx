It uses a synchronous RAM (Random Access Memory) named 'the_altsyncram'. This RAM is designed as a single port memory and is initialized with a hex file named \"lab7_soc_onchip_memory2_0.hex\". The memory size is set by several parameters including memory depth and word number, which are 4 in this case, making it a 4x32 bits memory. The module accepts several control and data signals as inputs that include address, byteenable, chipselect, write operation trigger, write data and a clock signal among others. The output is a 32-bit read data. This memory module is used for storing and retrieving data in a digital system or SoC."
