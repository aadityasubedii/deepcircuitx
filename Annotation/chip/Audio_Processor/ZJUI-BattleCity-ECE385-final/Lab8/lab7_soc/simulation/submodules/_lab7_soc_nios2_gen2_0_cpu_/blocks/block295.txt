Comment: 
This block is a sequential logic unit for data writing synchronization. The write data process is governed by the rising edge of the clock (clk) signal or the falling edge of the 'jrst_n' signal. If 'jrst_n' signal is set to 0, the data registered in 'writedata' is cleared (set to zero), whereas, on clock positive edge, the data ('writedata_nxt') prepared in the previous cycle is registered in 'writedata'.
