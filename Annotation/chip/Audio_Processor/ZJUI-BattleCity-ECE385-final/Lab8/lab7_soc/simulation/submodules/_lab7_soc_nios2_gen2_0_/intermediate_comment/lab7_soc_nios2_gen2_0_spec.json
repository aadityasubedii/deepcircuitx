    "spec": "Module name: lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0. \nModule specification: The 'lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0' is specifically characterized as a top-level wrapper for a Nios II Gen 2 soft-core processor. This processor module is typically assigned for system-on-chip designs (SoC) targeting Altera/Intel FPGAs. The module's role is to manage the overall communication with the CPU that includes supervising data and instruction address and buses, read and write enables, data buses, interrupts, and debug capabilities. Its design facilitates interaction with other parts of an SoC or more extensive systems as required. \n\nThe inputs to the module are: 'clk' for managing all synchronous operations, 'reset_n' for triggering asynchronous reset, 'reset_req' for initializing the reset of the module, 'd_readdata' for data input from a read operation from the data bus, 'd_waitrequest' for notifying if the module should wait for a data bus operation, 'i_readdata' and 'i_waitrequest' respectively for instruction data and instruction bus operation similar to data read, 'irq' for interrupt requests, and several inputs for debugging memory operations namely 'debug_mem_slave_address', 'debug_mem_slave_byteenable', 'debug_mem_slave_debugaccess', 'debug_mem_slave_read', 'debug_mem_slave_write', and 'debug_mem_slave_writedata'. \n\nThe outputs from the module include: 'd_address', 'd_byteenable', 'd_read', 'd_write', 'd_writedata' related to data operations, 'debug_mem_slave_debugaccess_to_roms' for debugging ROMs, 'i_address', 'i_read' for instruction operations, 'debug_reset_request' for requesting a reset, 'debug_mem_slave_readdata' for returning data from debug read operation, 'debug_mem_slave_waitrequest' to notify if debugging tool should wait, and 'dummy_ci_port' which is used mainly as a placeholder. \n\nThe code is streamlined and directly translates/port maps the system-level signals to the CPU-level ones and vice versa, justifying the lack of any internal signals. The only internal construction is the instantiation of the 'lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu' CPU module within the top-level module, which handles the actual signal processing internally. The streamlined structure provides a simplified interface to the more complex operations of the CPU. All the signals align with a typical Harvard Architecture used in many microprocessors, where the 'd' and 'i' prefixed signals adjudge the data and instruction bus operations respectively.",

This processor module is typically assigned for system-on-chip designs (SoC) targeting Altera/Intel FPGAs. The module's role is to manage the overall communication with the CPU that includes supervising data and instruction address and buses, read and write enables, data buses, interrupts, and debug capabilities. Its design facilitates interaction with other parts of an SoC or more extensive systems as required. \n\nThe inputs to the module are: 'clk' for managing all synchronous operations, 'reset_n' for triggering asynchronous reset, 'reset_req' for initializing the reset of the module, 'd_readdata' for data input from a read operation from the data bus, 'd_waitrequest' for notifying if the module should wait for a data bus operation, 'i_readdata' and 'i_waitrequest' respectively for instruction data and instruction bus operation similar to data read, 'irq' for interrupt requests, and several inputs for debugging memory operations namely 'debug_mem_slave_address', 'debug_mem_slave_byteenable', 'debug_mem_slave_debugaccess', 'debug_mem_slave_read', 'debug_mem_slave_write', and 'debug_mem_slave_writedata'. \n\nThe outputs from the module include: 'd_address', 'd_byteenable', 'd_read', 'd_write', 'd_writedata' related to data operations, 'debug_mem_slave_debugaccess_to_roms' for debugging ROMs, 'i_address', 'i_read' for instruction operations, 'debug_reset_request' for requesting a reset, 'debug_mem_slave_readdata' for returning data from debug read operation, 'debug_mem_slave_waitrequest' to notify if debugging tool should wait, and 'dummy_ci_port' which is used mainly as a placeholder. \n\nThe code is streamlined and directly translates/port maps the system-level signals to the CPU-level ones and vice versa, justifying the lack of any internal signals. The only internal construction is the instantiation of the 'lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu' CPU module within the top-level module, which handles the actual signal processing internally. The streamlined structure provides a simplified interface to the more complex operations of the CPU. All the signals align with a typical Harvard Architecture used in many microprocessors, where the 'd' and 'i' prefixed signals adjudge the data and instruction bus operations respectively."
