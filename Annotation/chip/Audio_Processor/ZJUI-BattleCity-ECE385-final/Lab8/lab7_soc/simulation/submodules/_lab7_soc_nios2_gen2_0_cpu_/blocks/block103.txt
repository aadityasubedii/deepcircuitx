Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code represents a synchronous reset logic block. The block functions based on a clock signal ('clk') and an active-low reset signal ('reset_n'). On a falling edge of 'reset_n', the control signal ('R_ctrl_shift_right_arith') for arithmetic right shift operation is reset to zero. Else, on the positive edge of the clock signal, when enable signal ('R_en') is true, the control signal is updated to its next state ('R_ctrl_shift_right_arith_nxt').
