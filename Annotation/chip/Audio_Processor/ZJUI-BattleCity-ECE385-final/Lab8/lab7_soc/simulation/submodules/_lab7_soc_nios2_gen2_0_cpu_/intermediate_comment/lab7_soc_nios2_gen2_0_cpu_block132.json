    "block_comment": "The block assigns the value of `D_op_call` to `D_ctrl_implicit_dst_retaddr`. This implementation is a simple assignment operation in Verilog, which typically runs whenever there is a change in `D_op_call`. In detail, the block signifies that `D_ctrl_implicit_dst_retaddr` will mirror `D_op_call`, such that whenever the `D_op_call` changes, `D_ctrl_implicit_dst_retaddr` will automatically update to match this new value."
