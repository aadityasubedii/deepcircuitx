    "block_comment": "This block plays the role of memory management in a Verilog hardware design. It writes data into the last element of a memory array 'mem' upon certain conditions. The block is clocked on the rising edge of a provided clock signal and can also be reset. On a high reset signal, the last element of the memory is cleared. When not being reset, if the 'write' signal is high or the memory isn't tagged as used (when `mem_used[DEPTH-1]` is false), the incoming payload `in_payload` is written into the last element of the memory (`mem[DEPTH-1]`)."
