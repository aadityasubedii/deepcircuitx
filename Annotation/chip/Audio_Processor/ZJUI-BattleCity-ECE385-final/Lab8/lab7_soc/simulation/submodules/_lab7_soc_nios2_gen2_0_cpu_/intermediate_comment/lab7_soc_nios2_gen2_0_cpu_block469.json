    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for setting the 'xbrk2_armed' signal based on the states of 'xbrk_ctrl2' and 'trigger_state'. The implementation includes a bitwise AND operation between 'xbrk_ctrl2[4]' and 'trigger_state_0', along with 'xbrk_ctrl2[5]' and 'trigger_state_1'. If either of these result in a high value, 'xbrk2_armed' will be set to high via a logical OR operation."
