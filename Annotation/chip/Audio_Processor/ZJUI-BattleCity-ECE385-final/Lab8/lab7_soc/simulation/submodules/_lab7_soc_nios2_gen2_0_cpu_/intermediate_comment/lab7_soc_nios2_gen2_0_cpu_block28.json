    "block_comment": "This block handles a control-loaded I/O register's state updating. It does this by checking the status of both the system clock and the reset signal. Every positive-edge of the system clock or negative-edge of the reset signal this block kicks into action. If the reset signal is active(low), it initializes the control-loaded I/O register to be \"0\". Otherwise, if the enable signal high, the register state gets updated at the next clock cycle with the next state."
