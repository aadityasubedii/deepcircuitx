This block is responsible for synchronizing the state of the execution stage in a pipelined design. It uses a wire assignment in Verilog RTL to tie the 'next state' of the execution control stage (R_ctrl_st_ex_nxt) to the 'current state' (D_ctrl_st_ex). This action is indicative of a stage in a pipeline moving to its next state, in preparation for the next clock cycle or an advancing pipeline. Implementation-wise, the 'assign' statement is used for continuous assignment, meaning the right-hand side expression is evaluated and the result is driven continuously on the left-hand side. The right hand side, D_ctrl_st_ex, is the driver for the wire R_ctrl_st_ex_nxt.
