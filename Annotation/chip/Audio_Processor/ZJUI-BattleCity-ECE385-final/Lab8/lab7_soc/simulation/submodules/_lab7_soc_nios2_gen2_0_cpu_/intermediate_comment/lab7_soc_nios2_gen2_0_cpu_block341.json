    "block_comment": "The block controls the enable signal of an entry (13) in a FIFO. It activates (sets to '1') `fifo_13_enable` under three conditions: when the current write pointer of the FIFO (`fifo_wrptr`) points to 13 and the condition `input_ge1` is met; or when entry 2 or entry 3 in the FIFO is free (`ge2_free` or `ge3_free` respectively), the next write pointer (`fifo_wrptr_plus1` or `fifo_wrptr_plus2`) points to location 13, and the relevant condition (`input_ge2` or `input_ge3`) is met. Each of these scenarios accounts for different usage conditions of the FIFO, ensuring reliable operation."
