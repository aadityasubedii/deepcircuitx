    "block_comment": "The block assigns the value of bits 32 and 33 from the \"jdo\" input to \"break_c_rr\". The functionality is realized using the built-in \"assign\" command in Verilog, extracting part of a bit-vector (in this case the 33rd and 32nd bit from the vector \"jdo\") and assigning this section to the \"break_c_rr\" output signal."
