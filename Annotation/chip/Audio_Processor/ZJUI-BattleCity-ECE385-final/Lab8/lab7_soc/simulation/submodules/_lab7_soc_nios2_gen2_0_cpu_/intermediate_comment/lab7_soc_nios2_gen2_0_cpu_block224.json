    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a multiplexer function to influence the next state of 'E_shift_rot_cnt'. If 'E_new_inst' is true, the next state of 'E_shift_rot_cnt' will be set to 'E_shift_rot_shfcnt'; otherwise, 'E_shift_rot_cnt' will be decremented by one. This process helps manage the shift or rotation count in the larger system, making adjustments based on new signals or as part of an ongoing operation."
