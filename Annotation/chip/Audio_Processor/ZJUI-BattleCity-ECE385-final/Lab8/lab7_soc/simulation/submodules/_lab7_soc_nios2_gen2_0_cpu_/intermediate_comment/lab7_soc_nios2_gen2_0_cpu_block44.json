    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of `D_ctrl_st` to the wire `R_ctrl_st_nxt`. This code is simply transferring the state of `D_ctrl_st` to `R_ctrl_st_nxt`, which is usually a part of state transitions in state machines, where `D` and `R` represent the current and next state respectively. The `assign` keyword in Verilog stands for continuous assignment which means the right-hand side is continuously evaluated and assigned to the left-hand side wire."
