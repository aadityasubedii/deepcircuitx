This block performs a synchronous reset & data update on av_ld_byte1_data. When a negative edge of reset_n occurs, it sets av_ld_byte1_data to 0 executing a reset operation. In the absence of a reset, at each positive edge of clk, if av_ld_byte1_data_en is HIGH (representing a signal that enables data update), av_ld_byte1_data gets updated with the value of av_ld_byte1_data_nxt. The block therefore acts as a flip flop with synchronous reset and data update capabilities.
