Comment: 
This block of code is a synchronous reset logic and data availability management module for a FIFO. This block activates at the rising edge of the clock (`clk`) or the falling edge of the reset signal (`rst_n`). When the reset signal is active (low), the `r_val` register is cleared and `t_dav` is set high. In the case that the reset is not active and during a clock's rising edge, the code updates `r_val` based on the 'not' of `wfifo_empty` logically AND-ed with `r_ena` and `t_dav` based on the 'not' of `rfifo_full`. This enables dynamic control of data availability, depending on whether the FIFO is full or empty.
