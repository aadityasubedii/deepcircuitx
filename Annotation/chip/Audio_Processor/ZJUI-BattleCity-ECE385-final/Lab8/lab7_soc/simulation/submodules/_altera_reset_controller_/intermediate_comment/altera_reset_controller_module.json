    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, altera_reset_controller, manages system reset signals in synchronization with a clock signal. It accepts multiple reset and reset-request inputs, and generates synchronized reset and reset-request output. The synchronization process, managed by numerous internal signals, adapts to variation in reset request behaviors by allowing user-configurable parameters and reducing digital design hazards. Features include reset requests consolidation, separate synchronizers for reset and request signals, flexible reset signaling based on different conditions, and an assertion chain for precise reset timing."
