Comment: 
The block of code represents the generate-if statement in Verilog used in the conditional generation of hardware during synthesis. The functionality of this block is to generate different circuitry based on the value of the parameter `inBitsPerSymbol`. It checks if `inBitsPerSymbol` is not equal to 18 and if so, it begins to execute a certain block of code (not shown here), presumably to adjust some design aspects in a different way than for the common case where `inBitsPerSymbol` is 18. Please note that the detailed operation inside the if-statement is not visible here.
