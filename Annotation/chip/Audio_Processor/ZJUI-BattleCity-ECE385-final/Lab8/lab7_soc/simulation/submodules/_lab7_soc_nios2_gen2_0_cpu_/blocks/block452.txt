Line number: 
[920, 920]
Comment: 
The code line assigns a constant logical zero value to the variable `dbrk0_goto1`. This action is done unconditionally and it means that `dbrk0_goto1` will always be zero as long as this assignment is active. The assignment is instantaneous and happens continuously as characteristic of the "assign" keyword in Verilog.
