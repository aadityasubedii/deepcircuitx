    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is used for handling binary comparison results. Depending on the `R_compare_op` variable, it selects the correct comparison result from the `E_eq` and `E_lt` signals. If `R_compare_op` is '00', equal comparison result `E_eq` is selected. When '01' is encountered, the inverse of the `E_lt` (less than) result is selected. If `R_compare_op` is '10', it directly selects `E_lt`. For any other values of `R_compare_op`, the inverse of the `E_eq` result is selected. This block functions as a multiplexer for different comparison results based on the operation type."
