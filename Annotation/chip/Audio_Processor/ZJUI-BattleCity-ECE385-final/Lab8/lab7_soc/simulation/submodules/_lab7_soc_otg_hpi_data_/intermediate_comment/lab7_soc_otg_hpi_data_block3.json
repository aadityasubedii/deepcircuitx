    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a read operation in a synchronous system. On a negative edge of reset signal (reset_n), it resets the output 'readdata' to 0, ensuring that the system starts afresh after a reset operation. On a positive edge of the clock signal (when clk_en is true), it assigns the the output 'readdata' to be the value of the 'read_mux_out', ensuring fresh data is available at each clock cycle. This mechanism ensures that the system is always working with the most recent data after a reset or at every clock cycle."
