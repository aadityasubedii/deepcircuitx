This block of code controls whether the 5th FIFO position (fifo_4) should be enabled for writing. It uses three conditions linked with 'OR' logic to determine the state of fifo_4_enable signal. First condition allows enabling when write pointer is at 4th position and input_ge1 is high. Second condition allows enabling when ge2_free is asserted, write pointer incremented by 1 points to 4th position and input_ge2 is high. The third condition allows enabling when ge3_free is asserted, write pointer incremented by 2 points to 4th position, and input_ge3 is high.
