    "block_comment": "This block of code acts as a register for control signals related to shifting and rotation operations based on an immediate 5-bit value. The register is either reset to 0 or updated on the rising edge of the clock. It operates synchronously with a positive edge-triggered clock and an active-low asynchronous reset signal. When the reset is asserted (i.e., goes low), the register 'R_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot' is reset to 0. If the 'reset_n' signal is not asserted and the enable signal 'R_en' is high, the register 'R_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot' is updated to the value of 'R_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot_nxt' on the next rising edge of the clock."
