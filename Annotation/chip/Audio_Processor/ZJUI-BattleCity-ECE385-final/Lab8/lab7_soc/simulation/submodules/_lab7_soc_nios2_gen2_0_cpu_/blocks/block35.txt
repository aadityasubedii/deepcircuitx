Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is used for assignment operation. It assigns the present value of 'D_ctrl_mem16' to 'R_ctrl_mem16_nxt'. This operation is distinctly non-blocking assignment, allowing calculations to be made based on current state values of the variables while keeping data coherency intact by not immediately changing those values.
