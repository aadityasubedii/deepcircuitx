This block is a simple flip-flop for the `xbrk_break` register with asynchronous reset and conditional update. When a negative edge appears on the `reset_n` line, the module resets the `xbrk_break` register to '0'. If there isn't a reset and `E_cpu_addr_en` signal is high during the positive edge of the clock, `xbrk_break` register will be updated with the value from `xbrk_break_hit`.
