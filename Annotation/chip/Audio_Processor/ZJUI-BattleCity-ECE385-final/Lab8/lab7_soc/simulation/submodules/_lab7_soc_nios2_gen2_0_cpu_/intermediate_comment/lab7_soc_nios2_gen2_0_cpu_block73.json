    "block_comment": "This block implements a flip-flop for controlling unconditional branches in a control flow. It is triggered at the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of the reset. If the reset signal (reset_n) is active (low in this case), the flip-flop is reset, and the R_ctrl_br_uncond signal gets the value '0'. On the other hand, if the reset signal is inactive and enable signal (R_en) is high, on the next clock edge it updates the value of R_ctrl_br_uncond signal with the value of R_ctrl_br_uncond_nxt."
