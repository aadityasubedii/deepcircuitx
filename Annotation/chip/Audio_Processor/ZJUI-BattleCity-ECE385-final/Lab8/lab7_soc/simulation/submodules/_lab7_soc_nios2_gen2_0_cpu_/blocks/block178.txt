Comment: 
This line of Verilog code signifies an assignment operation, setting the value of signal 'W_valid_from_M' equal to the signal 'W_valid'. The operation is performed continually whenever there is an update to the value of 'W_valid', denoted by the 'assign' keyword. This mechanism is used often for tracing signals, providing data flow paths, or simply duplicating a signal for use elsewhere in the design. The signals typically can represent control signals or data paths in the larger circuit logic.
