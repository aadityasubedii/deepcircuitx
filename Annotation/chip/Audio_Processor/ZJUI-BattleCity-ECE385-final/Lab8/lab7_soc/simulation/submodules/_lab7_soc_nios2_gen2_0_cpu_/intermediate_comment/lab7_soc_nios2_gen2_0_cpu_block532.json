    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for the assignment of a specific digital logic low value ('0') to a latch named 'dbrk_hit1_latch'. This latch gets its value directly assigned as a constant low logic level (implementation in a simple non-blocking manner using the 'assign' statement) without any conditional or combinatorial logic involved. This ensures that 'dbrk_hit1_latch' holds '0' value until another piece of code changes this assignment."
