    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is used for signal assignment of the 'trc_on_chip' signal. It defines 'trc_on_chip' as the inverse (logical NOT operation represented by '~') of the ninth bit (indexed from 0) of the 'trc_ctrl' bus. The logical NOT operation inverts the value of the bit in that position of 'trc_ctrl' to set the value of 'trc_on_chip'. If the ninth bit of 'trc_ctrl' is '1', 'trc_on_chip' will be '0' and vice versa."
