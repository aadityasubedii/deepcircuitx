This block is responsible for assigning different operation codes to the `D_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br` signal. It gathers as input several different operation codes including `D_op_call`, `D_op_jmpi`, `D_op_eret`, `D_op_bret`, `D_op_ret`, `D_op_jmp`, and `D_op_callr`, and funnels any high (True) values through an OR operation. As a result, if any of these operation codes are True, `D_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br` will be set to True.
