    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a 3-to-4 binary decoder, generating 4-bit output patterns corresponding to the 3-bit control bit input. The implementation begins with an always block that gets activated by any change in 'ctrl_bits_for_mux', which then goes through a case statement as a mux selector. Depending on the value of 'ctrl_bits_for_mux' varying from 3'b000 to 3'b111, the 4-bit 'td_mode' is set accordingly, providing a one-to-one mapping between the input and output."
