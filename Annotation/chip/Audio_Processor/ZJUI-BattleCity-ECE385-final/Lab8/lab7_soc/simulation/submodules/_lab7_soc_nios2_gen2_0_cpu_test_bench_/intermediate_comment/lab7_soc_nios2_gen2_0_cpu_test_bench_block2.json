    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as part of a testing environment for a Nios II Gen2 CPU implemented in a lab7_soc infrastructure. It uses a system clock and a reset signal as control flow inputs. If the reset signal is active (low), the block does nothing. However, during a clock rising edge when the reset is inactive (high), if both 'W_valid' (indicating valid data) and 'R_ctrl_ld' (control load signal) are high, it checks 'av_ld_data_aligned_unfiltered' (possibly a data signal) for any undefined states ('x'). When detected, the block logs a warning message with the simulation time."
