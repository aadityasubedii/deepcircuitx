    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is used for assigning the next-state value of the control bit for the ALU force AND operation. In detail, the current state `D_ctrl_alu_force_and` is assigned to `R_ctrl_alu_force_and_nxt`, indicating an anticipation of the ALU's forced AND operation in the next cycle. By doing this, the block allows the system to prepare for this specific ALU operation move ahead of time."
