Module-level comment: This module implements a test bench for a CPU in an SoC design, monitoring and validating CPU operations across various pipeline stages. It processes input signals representing instruction words, pipeline validity, memory access, and control signals. The module decodes operations, checks for undefined values, filters load data, and outputs filtered data and test status. It uses combinational logic for operation decoding and sequential logic for signal validation and error reporting during simulation.
