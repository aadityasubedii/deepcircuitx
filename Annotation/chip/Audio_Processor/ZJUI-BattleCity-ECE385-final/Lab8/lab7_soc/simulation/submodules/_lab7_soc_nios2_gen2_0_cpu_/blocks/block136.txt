This block of code implements a synchronous reset and update mechanism for a control register (R_ctrl_jmp_indirect). Upon a low signal on reset_n, it resets the control register to '0'. Also, under a positive clock edge, it checks if the enable signal (R_en) is high, then it assigns the next value (R_ctrl_jmp_indirect_nxt) to the current control register (R_ctrl_jmp_indirect). The block ensures data integrity, maintaining control states within a clock cycle and under reset conditions.
