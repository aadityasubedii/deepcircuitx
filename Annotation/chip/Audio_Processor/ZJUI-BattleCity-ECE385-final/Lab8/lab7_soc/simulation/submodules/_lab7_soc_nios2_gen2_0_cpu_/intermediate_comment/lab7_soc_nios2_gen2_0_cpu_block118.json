    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a register that updates on the rising edge of a clock signal and can be reset asynchronously. At every positive edge of the clock, if the reset signal (`reset_n`) is deasserted (logically `0`), the register `R_ctrl_crst` is cleared to `0`. However, if the register enable signal (`R_en`) is asserted, the value of `R_ctrl_crst_nxt` is assigned to `R_ctrl_crst` at the next clock cycle. The trigger on the negative edge of `reset_n` controls the asynchronous reset condition."
