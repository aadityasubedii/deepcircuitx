    "block_comment": "This block of code represents the function of a component of a FIFO register with active low synchronous reset in a hardware design. The `always` statement suggests that the block operates whenever a rising edge is detected on the `clk` signal or when `reset_n` experiences a falling edge. If `reset_n` is low (representing a reset state), then `fifo_5` is set to 0, fully resetting the specific component of the FIFO register. If `reset_n` is not low and `fifo_5_enable` is high, it denotes that FIFO5 is allowed to take the `fifo_5_mux` value at the clock's rising edge, implementing the FIFO operation."
