    "block_comment": "This block is a control mechanism for managing and assigning break conditions in a digital system. On each clock rising edge or falling edge of 'jrst_n' signal, it performs a check on 'jrst_n'. If 'jrst_n' is 0, it resets 'xbrk_ctrl' and 'trigbrktype' registers to 0. Otherwise, if 'take_action_any_break' is flagged, it resets 'trigbrktype' to 0, while 'dbrk_break' being true sets 'trigbrktype' to 1. If 'take_action_break_b' flag is active, it mechanism further assigns certain bits of 'xbrk_ctrl' registers based on the 'break_b_rr' and 'jdo' signals input. This helps in managing various control conditions contingent on specific break situations within the system."
