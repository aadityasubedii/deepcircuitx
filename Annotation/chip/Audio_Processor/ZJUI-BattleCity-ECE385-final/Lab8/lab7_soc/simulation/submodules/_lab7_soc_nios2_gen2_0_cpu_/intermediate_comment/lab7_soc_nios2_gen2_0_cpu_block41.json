    "block_comment": "The given block is used for data propagation where a signal is assigned a future state. It performs the task of holding the value of 'D_ctrl_ld_st_ex' for the next stage use, ensuring an efficient pipeline control. This is achieved using the 'assign' keyword that continuously drives the 'R_ctrl_ld_st_ex_nxt' with the value in 'D_ctrl_ld_st_ex', thereby matching the value of 'D_ctrl_ld_st_ex' in the next clock cycle."
