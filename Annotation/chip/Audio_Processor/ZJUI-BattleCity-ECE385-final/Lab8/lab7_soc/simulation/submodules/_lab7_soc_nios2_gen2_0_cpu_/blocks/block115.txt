This block of code is used for reset and update operations on the 'R_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg' register. Whenever there's a rising edge detected in the 'clk' signal or falling edge on 'reset_n' signal, it triggers the block. When the 'reset_n' signal is found low (active low reset), it resets the 'R_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg' register to zero. However, if the 'reset_n' signal is high and there's an enable signal 'R_en', it updates the 'R_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg' register with the next prospective value stored in 'R_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg_nxt'.
