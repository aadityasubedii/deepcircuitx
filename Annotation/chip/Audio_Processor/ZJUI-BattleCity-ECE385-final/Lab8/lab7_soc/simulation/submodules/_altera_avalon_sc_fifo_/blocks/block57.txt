This block of code is used to write input data into an array, and read data from the array. When a 'clk' event occurs, if 'in_valid' and 'in_ready' are both true, the data from 'in_payload' is written into 'mem' at the location 'wr_ptr'. At the same time, it reads the data from 'mem' at location 'mem_rd_ptr' and assigns that data to 'internal_out_payload'. Thus, it serves as a register for data transfer where the write and read locations are controlled by the 'wr_ptr' and 'mem_rd_ptr' pointers.
