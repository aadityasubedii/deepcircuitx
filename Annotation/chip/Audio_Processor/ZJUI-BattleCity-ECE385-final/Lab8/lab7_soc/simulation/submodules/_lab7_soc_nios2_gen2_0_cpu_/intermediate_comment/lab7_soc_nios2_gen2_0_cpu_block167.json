    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to implement a synchronous reset. The block is reset when a clock signal (clk) rises or when a reset signal (reset_n) falls. Specifically, the block assigns the value of 0 to `W_cdsr_reg` in both scenarios, ensuring the register value is cleared under these conditions. As such, the register `W_cdsr_reg` is always reset to a default state whenever either the reset signal falls, or the clock signal rises, providing an efficient way for managing the module's state."
