    "block_comment": "This block is assigning a value to the D_ctrl_mem8 signal based on a combination of conditions. It functions as an OR gate, setting D_ctrl_mem8 high if any of the D_op signal conditions (D_op_ldb, D_op_ldbu, D_op_ldbio, D_op_ldbuio, D_op_stb, D_op_stbio) are high. This block utilizes bitwise OR operation to achieve its function."
