Comment: 
This block of Verilog code outlines the functionality of a first-in, first-out (FIFO) memory unit. The logic is triggered on each clock cycle's positive edge or the negative edge of the reset line. If a reset is signaled (indicated by reset_n set to 0), the FIFO is cleared by setting its value to 0. On the other hand, if the FIFO enable line is active, the FIFO's value is updated with the value from the FIFO multiplexer."
