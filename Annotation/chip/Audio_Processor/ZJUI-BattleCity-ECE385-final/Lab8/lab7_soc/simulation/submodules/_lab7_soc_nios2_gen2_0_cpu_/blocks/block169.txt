Comment: 
This block of code controls the update of a register `W_ienable_reg` based on system clock and reset signals. The system adopts asynchronous reset and positive edge triggered clocking scheme. On the negative edge of `reset_n` (0), the register `W_ienable_reg` is reset (assigned a value of 0). On the positive edge of `clk`, the next state `W_ienable_reg_nxt` gets loaded into the `W_ienable_reg` register.
