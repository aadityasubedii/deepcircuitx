Comment: 
The provided block is a synchronous block of Verilog RTL code, responsible for controlling the input to a FIFO module (namely, `fifo_4`). It achieves this functionality by responding to both the rising edge of a clock signal (`clk`) and the falling edge of a reset signal (`reset_n`). On a reset (`reset_n` falling edge), the FIFO module is defaulted (cleared) to zero. During a clock cycle, if the `fifo_4_enable` signal is activated, the block will take the value from `fifo_4_mux` and assigns it to `fifo_4`.
