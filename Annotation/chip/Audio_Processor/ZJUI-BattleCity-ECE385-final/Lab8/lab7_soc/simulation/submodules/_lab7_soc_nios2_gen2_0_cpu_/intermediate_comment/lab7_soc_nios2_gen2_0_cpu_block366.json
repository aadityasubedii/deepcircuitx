    "block_comment": "The block assigns a value to 'fifo_4_mux' that depends on the current write pointers 'fifo_wrptr' and 'fifo_wrptr_plus1'. The write pointer indicates where in the FIFO (First In First Out) queue the data will be stored. The assignment operation checks several conditions based on the write point, and the validity of itm, atm, and dtm data which possibly can be events or data streams. For instance, if the fifo_wrptr points to '4'd4' (which is decimal 4), and itm data is valid, itm is assigned to fifo_4_mux. Similar conditions are applied for atm, and dtm data. In cases where fifo_wrptr_plus1 is '4'd4' and depending on whether itm, atm, or dtm is valid alongside ge2_free, different data are selected for fifo_4_mux. The last condition defaults to assign 'overflow_pending_dtm' to 'fifo_4_mux'.\n"
