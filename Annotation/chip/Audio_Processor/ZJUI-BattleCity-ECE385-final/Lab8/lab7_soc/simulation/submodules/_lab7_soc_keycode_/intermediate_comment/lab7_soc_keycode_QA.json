It basically receives input signals, such as address, chipselect, clock, reset, write operation details and written data. It then processes these inputs based on its internal logic to generate output and read data. The internal logic of the module is set to relay the written data when the chip is selected, write operation is negated and the address is 0. Also, this module does a reset on a negative edge of the reset trigger. The outputs of this module include an 8-bit 'out_port' and a 32-bit 'readdata'. The 'clk_en' is always set to 1, allowing the clock enabled operations to always pass."
