    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the enable signal of fifo_0 based on write pointers and input conditions. It sets the fifo_0_enable to true if one of the three scenarios occur: (a) when the write pointer is at position zero and the first input condition is met; (b) when the second gate is free, the write pointer plus one is at position zero, and the second input condition is met; (c) when the third gate is free, the write pointer plus two is at position zero, and the third input condition is met."
