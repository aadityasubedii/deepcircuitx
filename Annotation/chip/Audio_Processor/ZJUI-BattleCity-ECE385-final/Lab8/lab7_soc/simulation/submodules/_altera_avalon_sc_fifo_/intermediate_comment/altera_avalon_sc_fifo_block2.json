    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is a reset synchronizer that aims to generate a synchronised reset output 'rst0_out' considering input reset signal 'rst0'. It uses two sequential elements, or flip-flops, to suppress metastable occurrences. Implementation-wise, every positive edge of the clock, the input reset signal 'rst0' rings through to the second flip-flop via the first one. Reaching the second flip-flop can only be done on the following clock edge, thus 'rst0_out' is always synchronized to the rising edge of the system clock 'clk'. By employing dual flip-flops, this buffer effectively handles metastability and produces a synchronized reset signal 'rst0_out' that matches the system clock's edges."
