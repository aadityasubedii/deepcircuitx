    "block_comment": "This block of code is a flip-flop with synchronous reset functionality. The block gets triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of 'reset_n'. During the negative edge of 'reset_n', the output 'R_ctrl_b_is_dst' gets reset to '0'. Once reset, the output assumes the value of 'R_ctrl_b_is_dst_nxt' on the positive edge of the clock if 'R_en' is high."
