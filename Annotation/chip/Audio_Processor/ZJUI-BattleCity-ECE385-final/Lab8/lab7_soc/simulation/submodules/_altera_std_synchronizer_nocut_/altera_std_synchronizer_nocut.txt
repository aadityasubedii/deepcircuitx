Module-level comment: This module, altera_std_synchronizer_nocut, serves as a multi-stage synchronizer to mitigate metastability in signals transferring between different clock domains. A custom implementation allows handling of high/low reset logic, defined by the "rst_value" parameter. Input 'din' signal is synchronized via an initial register 'din_s1' and a series of further registers 'dreg' based on the "depth" parameter. For test purposes, this module can also simulate metastability using specific signals when the "__ALTERA_STD__METASTABLE_SIM" directive is defined. Error reporting is included if the synchronizer length is insufficient. The final synchronized signal 'dout' is output from the module.
