This block of code implements a shift register for synchronization purposes using Altera's reset synchronizer chain. The occurrence of a positive edge of the system clock (clk) triggers the shift register. The current value of 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain' is shifted rightwards, with its new most-significant-bit (MSB) being the value of 'reset_out_pre'. This synchronous update of the reset synchronizer chain ensures the mitigation of potential metastability issues arising from the asynchronous signal. The length of the synchronization chain and thus of the shift register is defined by the constant RSTREQ_ASRT_SYNC_TAP.
