Line number: 
[387, 387]
Comment: 
This line of code assigns the value of a subset of bits from the JDO signal to another signal called 'break_a_wpr'. The operation is a bit selection where only the bits from 32 to 35 (inclusive) from the JDO signal are selected and their values are assigned to the 'break_a_wpr' signal.
