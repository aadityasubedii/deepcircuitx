Comment: 
This block of code is primarily used to determine the depth of a particular function if the USE_FILL_LEVEL flag is enabled. It does it by declaring a 32-bit wide wire "depth32" and assigning it the value of DEPTH. If the USE_STORE_FORWARD flag is also enabled, it declares an additional register "curr_packet_len_less_one", which will likely store the length of the current packet minus one. This block appears to fall under a hardware description visualized with logic gates for computation, and RAM for information storage.
