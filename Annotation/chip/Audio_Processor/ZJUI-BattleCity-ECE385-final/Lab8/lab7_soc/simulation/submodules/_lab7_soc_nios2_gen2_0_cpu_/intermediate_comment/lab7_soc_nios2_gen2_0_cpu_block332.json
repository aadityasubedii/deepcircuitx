    "block_comment": "The Verilog code block performs a bit-wise reduction-OR operation on the `input_tm_cnt` signal. This operation analyzes all the bits of the `input_tm_cnt` digital signal and returns a Boolean true if any of the bit values in `input_tm_cnt` are set to 1, and false if all the bit values are 0, assigning the result to `input_ge1`. Hence, this block is used for fast detection if any bit in `input_tm_cnt` is high."
