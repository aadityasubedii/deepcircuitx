Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles the future or 'next' state control of exception handling or flagging. This is achieved via the use of an 'assign' operation that sets the future or 'next' state (R_ctrl_exception_nxt) of the exception control to the current data state (D_ctrl_exception). This operation is simplistic and deterministic, reflecting a state forwarding design approach.
