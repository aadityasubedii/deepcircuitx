This block is a reset and enable logic for a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue specifically 'fifo_12'. Operating synchronously with the system clock, it resets the FIFO when the reset signal, 'reset_n', is asserted low. If 'reset_n' is not low and the 'fifo_12_enable' signal is active, the block will update the FIFO queue with the value from 'fifo_12_mux'.
