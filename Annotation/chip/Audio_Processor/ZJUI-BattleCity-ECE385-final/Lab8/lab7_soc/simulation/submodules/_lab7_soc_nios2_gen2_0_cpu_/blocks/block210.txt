Comment: 
The block is responsible for determining the next read operation under specific conditions. It accomplishes this function by using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog to provide a continuous assignment statement. This operation is directed by the conditions expressed in parenthesis, which are connected with bitwise AND and OR operations. The variable 'd_read_nxt' will thus be assigned a value if either condition is met. Specifically, it takes the value of 'true' if there's an instruction for new load control operation and no validate errors from the register files, or if the current read operation is ongoing and a wait request has been issued.
