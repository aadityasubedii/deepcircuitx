    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the condition where a FIFO queue is almost full or almost empty. Specifically, it sets the maximum size of the FIFO queue to be one less than its specified depth if either of two pre-defined constants, one indicating a nearly full queue and the other a nearly empty queue, are truthy. This prevents an overflow or underflow situation in the FIFO queue operation by leaving a buffer space."
