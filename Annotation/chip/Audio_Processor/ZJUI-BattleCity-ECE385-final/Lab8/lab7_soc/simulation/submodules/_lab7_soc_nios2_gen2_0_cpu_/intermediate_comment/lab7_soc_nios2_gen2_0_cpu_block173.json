    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating the value of the `W_alu_result` signal. It implements synchronous behavior triggered by the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of `reset_n`. If `reset_n` is at a low level (Negative edge), `W_alu_result` is reset to `0`. Otherwise, on every positive clock edge, `W_alu_result` is updated with the value of `E_alu_result`."
