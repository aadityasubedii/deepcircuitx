    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns value from a slice of the E_src2 array to the E_shift_rot_shfcnt variable. Specifically, it assigns the value of the bits from indices 4 down to 0 of the E_src2 array to the E_shift_rot_shfcnt variable. This operation is a common one for manipulating bit fields within a larger data structure."
