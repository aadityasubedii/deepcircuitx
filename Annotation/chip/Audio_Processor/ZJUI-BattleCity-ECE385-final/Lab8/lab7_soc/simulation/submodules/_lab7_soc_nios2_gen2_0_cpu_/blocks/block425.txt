Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for the declaration of a boolean variable named 'is_dct' and its initialization. The assignment operator in Verilog is used here to initialize 'is_dct' with a boolean value of false. This operation occurs concurrently and is continuous, meaning that whenever any of the right-hand side operands changes, the assignment is immediately re-evaluated. The '1'b0' is a Verilog way to denote a single bit binary value of 0.
