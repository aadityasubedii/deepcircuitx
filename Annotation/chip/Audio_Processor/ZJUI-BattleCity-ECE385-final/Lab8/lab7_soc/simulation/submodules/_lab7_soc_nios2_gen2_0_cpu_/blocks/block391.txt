Comment: 
This block of code checks the validity of the 'atm' signal in the context of 'trc_this'. Specifically, the bitwise OR operation (|) is applied to the 4 most significant bits of 'atm' (from 35th to 32nd bit). The result is then logically ANDed with 'trc_this'. The resulting boolean signal 'atm_valid', denotes whether the 'atm' value in this bit range is non-zero and 'trc_this' is true.
