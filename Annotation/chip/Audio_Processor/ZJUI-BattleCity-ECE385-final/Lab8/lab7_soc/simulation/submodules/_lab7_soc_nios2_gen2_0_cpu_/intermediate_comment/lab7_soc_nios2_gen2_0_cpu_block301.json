    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the assignment of the 'ociram_byteenable' signal based on the condition of 'jtag_ram_access'. If 'jtag_ram_access' is active/high, then the 4-bit binary value 1111 (which corresponds to all four bytes enabled) is assigned to 'ociram_byteenable'. However, if 'jtag_ram_access' is not active/low, then 'ociram_byteenable' takes the value of the 'byteenable' signal. This is a typical conditional sign assignment block in a Verilog design controlling a signal that affects the byte enable for a memory element."
