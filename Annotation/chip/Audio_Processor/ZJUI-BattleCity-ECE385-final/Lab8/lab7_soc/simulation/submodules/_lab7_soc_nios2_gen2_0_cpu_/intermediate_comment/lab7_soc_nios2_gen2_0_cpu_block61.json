    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code describes a clocked sequential circuit. This circuit gets updated on the positive edge of the clock or whenever there's a negative edge on the reset signal. If the reset signal is de-asserted to logic 0, the operation is going to reset the `R_ctrl_br_cmp` register to 0. When the reset signal is not 0, it checks if `R_en` (presumably a enable signal) is high, if that's the case it updates the reserve control branch comparison register (`R_ctrl_br_cmp`) with its next specified value (`R_ctrl_br_cmp_nxt`) on the next clock edge."
