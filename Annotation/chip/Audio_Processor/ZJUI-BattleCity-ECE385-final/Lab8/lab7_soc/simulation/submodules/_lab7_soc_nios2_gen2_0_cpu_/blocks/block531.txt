Comment: 
This block of Verilog code defines a constant signal 'dbrk1_low_value' that is set to 0. This is accomplished simply with the 'assign' keyword followed by the signal name and the desired constant value. This represents a digital logic signal that will always return a low state or '0' when probed. This might be used in a larger design as a fixed reference or default value or to provide a consistant low state to a component in the digital system.
