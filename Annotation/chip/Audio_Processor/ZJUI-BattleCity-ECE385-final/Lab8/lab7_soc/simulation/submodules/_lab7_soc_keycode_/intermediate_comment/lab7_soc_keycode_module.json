    "module": "Module-level comment: The lab7_soc_keycode module serves as an input-output interface in a System on Chip (SoC) setup. It processes input signals such as address, chipselect, clock, write operation status, and written data, to generate correspondingly correct output data. It uses multiple internal signals to maintain and manipulate data. Logic state changes are triggered by the leading-edge of the clock signal or a reset. Inputs are multiplexed based on the chip select signal and the address, with output mirroring the data in the internal register 'data_out'. Reading is enabled when the multiplexer output is active."
