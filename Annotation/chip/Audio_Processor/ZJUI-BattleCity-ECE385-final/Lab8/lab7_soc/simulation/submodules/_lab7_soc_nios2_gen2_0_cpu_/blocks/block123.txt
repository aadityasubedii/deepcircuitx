Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is responsible for creating a new wire (D_ctrl_break) and assigning it a value based on the logical OR operation between D_op_break and D_op_hbreak. Implementation-wise, it uses bitwise OR operation to achieve the desired control signal. When either D_op_break or D_op_hbreak is true (1'b1 in Verilog), the D_ctrl_break will also become true (1'b1). Otherwise, it will be false (1'b0).
