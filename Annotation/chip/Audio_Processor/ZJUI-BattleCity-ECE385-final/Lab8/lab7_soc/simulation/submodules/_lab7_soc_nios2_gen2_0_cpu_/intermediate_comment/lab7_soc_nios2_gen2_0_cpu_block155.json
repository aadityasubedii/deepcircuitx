    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating the status register 'W_status_reg_pie'. It accomplishes this through a conditional statement, which checks if 'E_valid' is high. If 'E_valid' is true, the status register 'W_status_reg_pie' is assigned to the value of 'W_status_reg_pie_inst_nxt'; otherwise, it retains its current value."
