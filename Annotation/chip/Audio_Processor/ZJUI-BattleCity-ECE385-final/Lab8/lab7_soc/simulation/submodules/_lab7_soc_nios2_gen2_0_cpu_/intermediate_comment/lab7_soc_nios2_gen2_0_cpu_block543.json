    "block_comment": "The block creates a debug acknowledgement signal (debugack). Its function is derived from the hardware breakpoint (hbreak) status: if hbreak is enabled, debugack will be low; otherwise, debugack will be high. This function is implemented using a single assign statement and the bitwise NOT operator (~), inverting the boolean value of hbreak_enabled."
