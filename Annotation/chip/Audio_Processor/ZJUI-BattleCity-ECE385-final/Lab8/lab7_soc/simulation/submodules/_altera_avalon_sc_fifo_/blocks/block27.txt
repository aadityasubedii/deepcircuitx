Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles the synchronous reset and data forwarding for an output signal in a digital system. When a positive edge of either the system clock (clk) or reset signal occurs, the block performs a check. If the reset signal is high, it clears the output validation flag (out_valid) and output payload (out_payload) by setting them to 0. In the absence of a reset, when the internal transmission readiness flag (internal_out_ready) is high, it sets the out_valid to the logical AND of internal_out_valid and ok_to_forward, effectuating the signal propagation based on the readiness and permission conditions. Similarly, it updates out_payload with the internal payload.
