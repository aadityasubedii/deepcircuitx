    "block_comment": "This block of code is defining a flip-flop circuit behavior that indicates if it's ready to accept data. The flip-flop is updated negatively on reset (rst_n) or positively on the clock signal. If it's reset, readyfordata is set to 0, indicating that the system is not ready for data. On a positive clock edge, readyfordata is set to the inverse of the current value of fifo_FF. It represents an essential part for handling data flow control in a FIFO (First In, First Out) system."
