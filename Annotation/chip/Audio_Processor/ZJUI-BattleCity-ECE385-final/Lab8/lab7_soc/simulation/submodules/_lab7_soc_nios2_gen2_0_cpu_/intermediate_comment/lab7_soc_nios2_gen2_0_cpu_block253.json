    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements an always block that is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal. This block is used to set the validity of recoverable Error Correction Code (ECC) in a Register File (RF). If the reset is active (low), the validity of the recoverable ECC is set to invalid (0). Once the reset is not active (high), the validity of the recoverable ECC is set based on the value of E_rf_ecc_recoverable_valid. This is crucial for the correction of non-critical errors and maintaining the accuracy of data stored in the RF.\n"
