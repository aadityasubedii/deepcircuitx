Module-level comment: This module, altera_reset_synchronizer, manages reset signal synchronization for digital systems, controlled via two parameters: ASYNC_RESET and DEPTH for mode and depth of sync chain. The module takes "reset_in" and "clk" as inputs and produces "reset_out", synchronized to the clock. It uses an internal chain of registers to sequentially synchronize the reset signal across clock cycles, with synchronization being immediate or synchronized to the clock edge depending on ASYNC_RESET. The synchronized output is maintained in "altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out".
