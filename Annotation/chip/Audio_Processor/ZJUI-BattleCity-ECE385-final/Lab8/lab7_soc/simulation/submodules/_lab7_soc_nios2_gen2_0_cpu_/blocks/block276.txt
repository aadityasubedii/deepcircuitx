Comment: 
The block of code generates an interrupt request (intr_req) signal. The request is activated whenever there's a pending interrupt, denoted by W_ipending_reg, and the processor interrupt enable bit, which is W_status_reg_pie, is set to 1. The operation is achieved using the bit-wise AND operator on the two signals resulting in an active 'intr_req' when there's an interrupt request pending and the interrupt functionality is enabled.
