    "block_comment": "The block manages a synchronous reset and data input for a digital system. When a negative reset signal is detected (i.e., reset_n is equal to 0), the block sets the register `din_s1` to binary 0. Otherwise, under a positive clock edge without reset, it assigns the value of the input data ('din') to the register `din_s1`. This block is tailored to handle synchronous data inputs under normal operational conditions and to force the register `din_s1` to a known state during a reset operation."
