    "block_comment": "This block of code is in charge of managing error states in the system. It operates by triggering on the rising edge of clock signal, where it checks if the reset condition is not active. If the signal 'F_valid' is undetermined or high-impedance, it writes an error message indicating the 'F_valid' state and halts the simulation. The use of bitwise XOR '^' on '(F_valid)' checks if all bits in the multi-bit 'F_valid' are the same or not. This system's design objective is to enhance error debugging and safeguard against system failure.\n"
