The FIFO ensures that the data written into the buffer is read out in the same order. The module takes standard inputs such as write, read, write data, clock and reset. It also provides several output flags like almost empty, almost full, empty, full to signify the state of the buffer.\n\n  - \"lab7_soc_sdram\": This module appears to be interfacing with a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM). It handles the logic related to maintaining the state of the SDRAM and performing operations like refreshing the memory, reading and writing data, translating the command codes etc. The complexity of this module suggests it's designed to handle the complex timing and control signal requirements of a SDRAM.
