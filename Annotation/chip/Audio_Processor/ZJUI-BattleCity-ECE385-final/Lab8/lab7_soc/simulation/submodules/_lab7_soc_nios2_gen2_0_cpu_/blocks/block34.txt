Comment: 
This block is a synchronous design for updating a control memory register (R_ctrl_mem16). The update is triggered by a rising edge of a system clock (clk) or a falling edge of a reset signal (reset_n). During a reset (when reset_n signal is low), R_ctrl_mem16 is set to zero. Apart from the reset condition, if the enable signal (R_en) is high, R_ctrl_mem16 is updated with the subsequent value (R_ctrl_mem16_nxt) at every rising edge of the clk.
