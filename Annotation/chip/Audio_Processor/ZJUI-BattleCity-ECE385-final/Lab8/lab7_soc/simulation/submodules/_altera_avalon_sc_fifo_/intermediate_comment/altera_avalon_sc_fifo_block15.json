    "block_comment": "The block defines an optional parameter, `max_fifo_size`, used to define the maximum size of a FIFO queue. This feature is conditionally generated based on the `USE_STORE_FORWARD` configuration setting. When the `USE_STORE_FORWARD` signal is true, `max_fifo_size` is assigned the value of `FIFO_DEPTH - 1`."
