    "block_comment": "This block of code simply assigns a constant value, specifically '0', to the signal `not_in_debug_mode`. This statement means that the system/software is not currently operating in a debug mode. The implementation is accomplished by using the `assign` keyword in Verilog which is used to create continuous assignments that drive a value onto a wire based on a given expression, in this case, a binary literal '0'. Overall, this block reflects a simple state assignment indicating a non-debug operational mode."
