    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing the ready signal line of a pipeline in an unregistered state. This is achieved by assessing the readiness of the pipeline based on the absence of a full condition (denoted by ~full1) or the presence of an \"out_ready\" condition. This result is then assigned to the \"in_ready\" signal which is used to manage the data flow in the rest of the design."
