    "block_comment": "This block in the Verilog code is responsible for generating an output signal for a high-level break request (`oci_hbreak_req`). The request signal is activated when any one of the following conditions occur: a JTAG debugging session is initiated (`jtag_break`), a data breakpoint trigger (`dbrk_break`), an execution breakpoint (`xbrk_break`), or a general debug request (`debugreq`) is detected. The statemen uses the logical OR operation to lace all these conditions together."
