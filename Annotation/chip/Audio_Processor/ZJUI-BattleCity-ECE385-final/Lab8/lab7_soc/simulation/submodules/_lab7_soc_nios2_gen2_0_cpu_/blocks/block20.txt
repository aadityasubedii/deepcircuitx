This block is a simple hardware assigning statement. It assigns the value of `D_ctrl_src2_choose_imm` to `R_ctrl_src2_choose_imm_nxt` in the next hardware clock cycle. This is part of the pipeline control logic of the processor, and its function is to pass the control signal that determines whether the second source operand in the executing instruction is an immediate or a register value to the next stage in the pipeline. The implementation is straightforward: Verilog's `assign` statement is used here for continuous assignment to hold and pass the value from one pipeline stage to the next.
