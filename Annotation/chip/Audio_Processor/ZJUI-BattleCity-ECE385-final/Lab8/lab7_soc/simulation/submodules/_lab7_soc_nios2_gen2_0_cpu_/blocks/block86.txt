This block assigns the value of `D_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm` to `R_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm_nxt` under specific conditions. The `assign` statement is a continuous assignment statement used in data flow modeling, meaning the left side gets the value of the expression on the right side when the right side changes. In this case, the register `R_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm_nxt` takes the value of `D_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm` once there's a change in its value.
