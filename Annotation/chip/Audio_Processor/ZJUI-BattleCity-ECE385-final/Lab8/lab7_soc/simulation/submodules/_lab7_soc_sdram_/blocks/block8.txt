This block of code ensures functionality of a reset and shift register operation for read validation. When a negative edge reset is captured or a positive edge clock signal is detected, this block is activated. On sensing a negative reset signal, it presets 'rd_valid' to a three-bit zero value. In every other situation, the 'rd_valid' value is updated by shifting its present value one bit to the left and concatenating a 'rd_strobe' value after two zero bits.
