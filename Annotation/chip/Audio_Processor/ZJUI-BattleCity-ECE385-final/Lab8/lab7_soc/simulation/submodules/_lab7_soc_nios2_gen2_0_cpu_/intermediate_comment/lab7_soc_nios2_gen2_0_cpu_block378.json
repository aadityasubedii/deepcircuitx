    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the data that gets passed into the first position of a FIFO queue (fifo_0_mux). It uses a series of conditionals to decide the source of the input. The data can either come directly from the itm variable, the overflow_pending_atm variable, or the overflow_pending_dtm variable. This decision is based on the current write pointer position (fifo_wrptr or fifo_wrptr_plus1), the state of the itm_valid, atm_valid and dtm_valid control signals, and whether there are at least two free spaces in the queue (ge2_free). In case none of these conditions are met, it defaults to using the overflow_pending_dtm input."
