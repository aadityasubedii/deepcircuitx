    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a flip-flop with asynchronous reset in Verilog RTL. Upon the negative edge of 'reset_n', the input 'din_s1' is set to binary 1 regardless of the clock signal. In all other scenarios, the value of 'din' is assigned to 'din_s1' at the positive clock edge. This block is essentially synchronous with 'clk', but becomes asynchronous when 'reset_n' goes low. This design pattern is common in digital circuits where a reset is required."
