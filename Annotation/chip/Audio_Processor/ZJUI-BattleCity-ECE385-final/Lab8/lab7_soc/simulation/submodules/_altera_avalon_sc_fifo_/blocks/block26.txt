Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code assigns and updates the output validation and data payload. It uses the `always @*` construct to achieve its function. In this construct, the value of `out_valid` is always equal to the value of `internal_out_valid` and the value of `out_payload` is always equal to the value of `internal_out_payload`. The values are updated anytime there is a change in the input signals (as captured by `@*`), making the output of this block directly dependent on the internal signals.
