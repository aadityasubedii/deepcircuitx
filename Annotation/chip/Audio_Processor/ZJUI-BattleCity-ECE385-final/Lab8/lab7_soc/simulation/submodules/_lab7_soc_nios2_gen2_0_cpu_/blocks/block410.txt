The block of code is used to check if the sync_timer has reached zero and generates a boolean signal accordingly. The implementation uses an assign statement that compares the current value of sync_timer to zero, generating a '1' (true) if sync_timer is zero and '0' (false) otherwise. This boolean signal can be used in other logic blocks as a trigger once the sync_timer reaches zero.
