    "block_comment": "This hardware block is a resettable and addressable data output latch. The block activates on either the positive edge of the clock cycle or the negative edge of a reset signal. If the reset signal is not asserted (reset_n == 0), the the output data 'data_out' is reset to zero. Otherwise, if the chip is selected (chipselect is true) and a non-write request (!write_n) is issued for address zero, then the least-significant byte of the 'writedata' is latched and presented on the 'data_out'."
