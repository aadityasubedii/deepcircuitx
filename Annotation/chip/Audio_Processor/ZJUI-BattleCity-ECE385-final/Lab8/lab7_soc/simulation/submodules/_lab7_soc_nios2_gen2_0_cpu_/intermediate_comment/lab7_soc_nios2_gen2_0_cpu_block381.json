    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for wire assignment. It assigns the value of the wire 'itm' to 'tw'. The assignment operation is carried out continuously, meaning whenever there's a change in the value of 'itm', the change is immediately reflected in 'tw'. The 'assign' statement is one of the concurrent statements in Verilog, and its functionality is describing the connections between the hardware components."
