    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a system reset and initializer. It functions as a synchronizer with the rising edge of the clock pulse (\"posedge clk\") or the falling edge of a negative reset pulse (\"negedge reset_n\"). If the system is in a reset condition (i.e., \"reset_n\" is equal to 0), it forces the signal \"init_done\" to the low level (0). Else, if the system is not in a reset condition, it sets the signal \"init_done\" whenever the internal state \"i_state\" equals binary '101'. This process ensures timely initialization and re-initialization of the system for orderly functioning."
