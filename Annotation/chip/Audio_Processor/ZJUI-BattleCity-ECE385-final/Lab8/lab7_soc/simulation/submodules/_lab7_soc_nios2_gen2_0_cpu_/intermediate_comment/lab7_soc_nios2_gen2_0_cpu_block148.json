    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a flip-flop with asynchronous reset and clock-based data update for the `hbreak_enabled` signal. The operation begins with either a positive edge of the clock signal or a negative edge of the reset signal. When `reset_n` is lowered (active-low reset), `hbreak_enabled` is set to 1. If `reset_n` is high and `E_valid` is true during a clock cycle, `hbreak_enabled` will be updated based on `R_ctrl_break` and `D_op_bret` conditions. If `R_ctrl_break` is true, `hbreak_enabled` is set to 0, and if `D_op_bret` is true, `hbreak_enabled` is set to 1. In any other case, the value of `hbreak_enabled` remains the same."
