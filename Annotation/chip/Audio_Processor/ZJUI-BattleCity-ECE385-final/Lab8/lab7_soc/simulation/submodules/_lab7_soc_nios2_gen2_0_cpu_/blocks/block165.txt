Comment: 
This Verilog RTL block selects between three potential data sources based on specific control signals. If the branch compare control signal `R_ctrl_br_cmp` is active (high/true), the block assigns the `W_cmp_result` to `W_wr_data_non_zero`. Otherwise, if the read control register `R_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg` is active, `W_control_rd_data` is assigned. If neither control signals are active, the block defaults to assigning the least significant 32 bits of the ALU result (`W_alu_result[31 : 0]`) to `W_wr_data_non_zero`.
