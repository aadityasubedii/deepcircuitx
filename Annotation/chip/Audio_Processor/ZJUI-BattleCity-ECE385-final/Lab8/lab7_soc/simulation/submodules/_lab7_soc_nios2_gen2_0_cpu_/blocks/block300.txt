This block enables the write operation for an on-chip RAM (OCIRAM). It achieves this by using the ternary operator to decide which of the write enable signals (either from JTAG or Avalon interface) to assign to the OCIRAM write enable signal. If the JTAG RAM access is active, it assigns the JTAG RAM write signal and if not, it assigns the Avalon interface RAM write signal to the OCIRAM write enable.
