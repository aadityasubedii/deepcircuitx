    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential circuit that controls the byte-enable signal based on the system clock and jrst_n input. Upon the positive edge of the clock or negative edge of jrst_n, if jrst_n is zero, it resets the byteenable to zero, else it keeps the byteenable value to byteenable_nxt, thus giving control of byteenable registration."
