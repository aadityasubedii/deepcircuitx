    "block_comment": "The block signifies a done condition for a shift or rotate operation in electronic circuitry. The operation completion is determined by the equality comparison between 'E_shift_rot_cnt' and zero. The '&' logical operator ensures that the 'E_shift_rot_done' signal is assigned true only when 'E_shift_rot_cnt' is zero and the 'E_new_inst' is not active; ensuring that a new operation cannot start before the previous one is finished."
