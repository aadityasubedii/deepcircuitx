    "block_comment": "This block of code checks if the greater or equal to 3 (ge3) resource is free. It uses a bitwise AND operator to combine the free status of greater or equal to 2 (ge2) with the negation of the bit-wise reduction AND of the lower four bits of the fifo_cnt. If ge2 is free and all the lower 4 bits of fifo_cnt are not set, only then ge3 is marked as free."
