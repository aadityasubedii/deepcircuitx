Module name: altera_reset_controller. 

Module specification: The altera_reset_controller module is a comprehensive design for managing the reset signal in synchronization with a provided system clock signal. It enhances overall system functionality by coordinating the multiple reset input sources and, optionally, multiple reset request inputs in a systematic manner. The module controls reset signals effectively to synchronize them to the system clock and thereby reduce potential hazards in digital design, such as glitches, races, and metastability. 

The module accepts up to 16 reset inputs (reset_in0 to reset_in15) and reset requests (reset_req_in0 to reset_req_in15) as input ports to accommodate system variations. It also requires a system clock (clk). It delivers one output for the final reset signal (reset_out) and another for a reset request (reset_req). These output ports represent the synchronized reset and reset requests that are propagated further into the system.

The internal workings of the module involve a series of internal signals that facilitate the synchronization process. This includes ASYNC_RESET determining the mode of output, MIN_METASTABLE for managing metastability, RSTREQ_ASRT_SYNC_TAP to synchronize the reset request, and LARGER along with ASSERTION_CHAIN_LENGTH for calculating the assertion chain length. Besides these, signals like RESET_REQ_DRST_TAP, merged_reset, merged_reset_req_in, reset_out_pre, reset_req_pre, altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain, r_sync_rst_chain, r_sync_rst, and r_early_rst coordinate and control the flow within the module. 

The module's operation includes certain blocks featuring functionality for merging reset requests, synchronizing the merged reset and reset requests with the clock signal, and ensuring early reset and signaling of reset request based on different module parameters and conditions. The code is designed for flexibility, with an ability to handle variations in reset request behaviors. Through this, it manages to minimize reset-related hazards in the system.
