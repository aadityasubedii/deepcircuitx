    "spec": "Module name: lab7_soc_keycode_0. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe lab7_soc_keycode_0 module is a Verilog RTL top-level design that functions as a controller for memory read and write operations. Primarily, it records certain data from a 32-bit input bus ('writedata') into a 16-bit register ('data_out') when predefined conditions are met - when chipselect is high, write_n is low, and the address is zero. The stored data is cleared if the reset_n signal is active (low).\n\nInput ports for the module include: a 2-bit 'address' for location of operation, 'chipselect' to enable the write operation when active (high), 'clk' as the system clock for data latching, 'reset_n' to reset output data when active (low), 'write_n' to allow data write operation when inactive (low), and 'writedata', a 32-bit input data bus where the actual data comes from. \n\nOutput ports are: 'out_port', a 16-bit direct mirror of the 'data_out', and 'readdata', a 32-bit wide output port displaying the 'read_mux_out' depending upon the address.\n\nInternal signals in the design include 'clk_en' which always gets a value 1 but seems to be unused here, 'data_out' which stores the data for writing, 'out_port' to output the stored data, and 'read_mux_out' and 'readdata' for data reading. \n\nThe main sections of the code include an assignment block used to assign values to signals like 'clk_en', 'read_mux_out', 'readdata', and 'out_port', as well as an always block where the conditions are checked and data is written into the 'data_out'. This module employs some important RTL coding concepts like use of clocking events, positive and negative edge sensitivity, bit-wise operations, and conditional concatenations.",

It has an interface of standard input-output ports such as address, chipselect, clk, reset_n, write_n and writedata for input, and out_port and readdata for output. When a chip is selected (=1), write_n is not active (~write_n), and the address is zero, data from the 'writedata' bus (specifically, the lower 16 bits) is stored (latched) into 'data_out'. If reset goes active (low), 'data_out' is cleared (set to 0). Thus, it mainly performs the function of data writing and management based on the applied conditions."

The rising edge of the clock is used for latching the data.\n4. reset_n: This is the reset signal. When this signal goes low (active), the output data will be reset.\n5. write_n: This signal, when low, enables data to be written to the data_out register provided address is zero and chipselect is high.\n6. writedata: This is a 32-bit input data bus, from which data will be taken and stored into 'data_out' when write is enabled.\n\nOutput Ports:\n1. out_port: This 16-bit output is connected to the 16-bit register 'data_out'.
