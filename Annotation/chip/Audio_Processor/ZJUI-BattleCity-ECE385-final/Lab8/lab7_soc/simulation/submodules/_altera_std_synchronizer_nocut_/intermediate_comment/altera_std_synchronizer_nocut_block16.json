    "block_comment": "This code block is used to generate the next value (`next_din_s1`) for a given serial data input line (`din`). The block realizes this function by applying a conditional operation that checks if the previous input data (`din_last`) is different from the current input data (`din`). If it's different, the block assigns a random number to `next_din_s1` else it assigns the current value of `din` to `next_din_s1`."
