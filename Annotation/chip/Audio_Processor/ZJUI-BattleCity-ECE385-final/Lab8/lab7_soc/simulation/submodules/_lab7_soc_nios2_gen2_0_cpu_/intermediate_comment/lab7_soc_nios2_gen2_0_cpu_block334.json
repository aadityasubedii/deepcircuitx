    "block_comment": "This block describes a synchronous FIFO operation on a 15-bit register. The operation is clocked and optionally reset by two external controls: a positive-edge triggered clock and an active-low asynchronous reset. On receiving a low signal from the reset control, the block zeroes the value of the FIFO register (fifo_15); otherwise on each clock's rising edge, if the FIFO is enabled (fifo_15_enable is high), the content is updated from the multiplexer output - fifo_15_mux."
