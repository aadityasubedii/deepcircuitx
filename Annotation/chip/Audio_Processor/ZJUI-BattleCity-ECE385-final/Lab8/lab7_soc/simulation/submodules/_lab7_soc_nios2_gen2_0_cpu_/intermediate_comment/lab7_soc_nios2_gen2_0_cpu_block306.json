    "block_comment": "This block of code implements an increment operation on a specific segment of the register MonAReg. The block takes an 8-bit subset (bit 2 to bit 10) of MonAReg, adds one to its current value, and outputs the result to MonARegAddrInc. The operation is performed whenever the values of the MonAReg signals from bit 2 to bit 10 change."
