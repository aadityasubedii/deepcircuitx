    "block_comment": "The block configures the D_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison signal based on various operation codes. Implemented in Verilog, it uses bitwise OR operations to combine multiple operation code signals (D_op_cmpge, D_op_cmpgei, D_op_cmplt, D_op_cmplti, D_op_bge, D_op_blt) and assigns the result to D_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison."
