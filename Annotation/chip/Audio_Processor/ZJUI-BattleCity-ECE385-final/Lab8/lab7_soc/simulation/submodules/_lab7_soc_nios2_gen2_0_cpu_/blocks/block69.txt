This block controls the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) subtraction operation by combining multiple operation decision flags. The flags included are subtraction, less than, unsigned less than, greater equal, unsigned greater equal, as well as their immediate versions and branching versions. If any of these flags are true, the ALU will perform a subtract operation.
