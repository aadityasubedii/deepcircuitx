    "block_comment": "This block of code declares and assigns a single wire named 'xbrk3_goto0_hit'. It assigns 'xbrk3_goto0_hit' with a constant value of 0, indicating that it is a default or 'not hit' value. This is typically used in control flow structures such as switches, conditional statements, and loops and is used to denote the absence of certain conditions or states in the logic flow."
