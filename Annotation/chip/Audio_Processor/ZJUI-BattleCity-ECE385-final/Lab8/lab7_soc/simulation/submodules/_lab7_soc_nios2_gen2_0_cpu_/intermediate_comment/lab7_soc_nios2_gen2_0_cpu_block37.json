    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a synchronous reset and write operation of a control memory bit (`R_ctrl_mem8`). It primarily checks the state of a negative-edge triggered reset signal (`reset_n`). If `reset_n` is low, meaning a reset operation is required, the control memory bit `R_ctrl_mem8` is reset to 0. On the other hand, if `reset_n` is not triggered (high), and the write enable signal (`R_en`) is active, the content of `R_ctrl_mem8` is updated to the next state (`R_ctrl_mem8_nxt`) at the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`)."
