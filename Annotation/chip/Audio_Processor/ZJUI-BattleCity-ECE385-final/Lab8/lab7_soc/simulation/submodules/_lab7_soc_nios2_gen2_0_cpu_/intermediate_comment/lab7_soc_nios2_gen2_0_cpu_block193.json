    "block_comment": "This block assigns a new value to the variable 'av_ld_byte1_data_nxt' based on certain conditions. If the variable 'av_ld_rshift8' is true, 'av_ld_byte1_data_nxt' will be assigned the value of 'av_ld_byte2_data'. Otherwise, if 'av_ld_extend' is true, 'av_ld_byte1_data_nxt' gets assigned a value based on 8 repetitions of 'av_fill_bit'. If neither condition is true, 'av_ld_byte1_data_nxt' is assigned the value of bits 8 to 15 from 'd_readdata'."
