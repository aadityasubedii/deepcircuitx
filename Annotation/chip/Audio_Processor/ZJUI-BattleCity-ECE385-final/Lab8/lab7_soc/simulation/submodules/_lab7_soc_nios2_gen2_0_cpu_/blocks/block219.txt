This piece of code defines a flip-flop for a variable `E_shift_rot_result` that is clocked by a positive edge of `clk` and has an asynchronous reset. The purpose of the block is to hold the value of `E_shift_rot_result` and only change it based on rising edge of clock or an active low reset. If an active low reset condition is detected (`reset_n == 0`), the `E_shift_rot_result` is set back to zero immediately disregarding `clk`. Otherwise, on each rising edge of `clk`, the value of `E_shift_rot_result` is updated to the next state held in `E_shift_rot_result_nxt`.
