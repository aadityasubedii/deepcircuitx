This block regulates the control for shift and rotation operations based on clock or reset signals. On a rising edge of the clock or falling edge of the reset signal, if the reset is active (low), it resets the control for shift and rotation operations to zero. However, if the reset is not active and read-enable (R_en) flag is set, it loads the next set of control values for the shift and rotation operations into the current control register. The block achieves this with a combination of conditionals and sequential logic.
