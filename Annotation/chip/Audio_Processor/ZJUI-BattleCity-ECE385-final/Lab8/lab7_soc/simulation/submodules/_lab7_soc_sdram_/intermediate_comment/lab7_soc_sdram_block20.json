    "block_comment": "This block manages read/write operations for a circular buffer. Upon reset, read/write addresses are reset. During a write operation, if `full` is not asserted, the module increments `entries` and `wr_address`. During a read operation, if `empty` is not asserted, it decrements `entries` and increments `rd_address`. On `rdwr`=3, both `rd_address` and `wr_address` are incremented. This hardware block allows the handling of a circular buffer for asynchronous read/write operations."
