    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for writing data into a FIFO buffer when the corresponding write flag is set. During each positive edge of the system clock, the block of code checks the status of 'fifo_wr'. If 'fifo_wr' is true, that indicates it is ready to write data, and the character data 'fifo_wdata' is then written to the simulation output file via a system-level write function `$write`."
