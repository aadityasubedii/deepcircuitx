    "block_comment": "This block is performing a simple concatenation operation to create an output vector `dct_code`. It does this by using Verilog's built-in concatenation operation, represented by the `{}`. The `assign` keyword is used to create a continuous assignment of the result of this operation to the `dct_code` output. The two input signals, `is_cond_dct` and `dct_is_taken`, are joined together to form the output vector `dct_code`. The bit order of the original signals is preserved in the output."
