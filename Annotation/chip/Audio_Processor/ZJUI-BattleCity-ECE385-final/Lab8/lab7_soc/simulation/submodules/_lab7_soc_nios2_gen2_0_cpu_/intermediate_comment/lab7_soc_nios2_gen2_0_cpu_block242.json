    "block_comment": "This block of code illustrates a commonly employed technique in clocked digital logic design referred to as a flip-flop. The use of flip-flop here is to control the validation signal of a specific module (possibly a pipeline stage). The validation signal \"E_valid_from_R\" is set to 0 in the event of a negative edge reset. On the other hand, on every positive edge of the clock, the same validation signal is assigned the logical OR of \"R_valid\" and \"E_stall\" provided there's no active reset. The OR operation essentially means \"E_valid_from_R\" is asserted when either \"R_valid\" is true, indicating valid data from the previous stage, or when \"E_stall\" is true, implementing pipeline stalling mechanism."
