    "block_comment": "The function of the block is to synchronize the `debugack` signal to the `tck` clock domain. The block uses an instance of the `altera_std_synchronizer` module for this. The `debugack` signal is passed to `din` (data input) of the synchronizer and the synchronized output is taken from `dout` (data output) with the name `debugack_sync`. The module is also provided with a reset signal `unxcomplemented_resetxx1`, active when low (as indicated by the suffix `_n`)."
