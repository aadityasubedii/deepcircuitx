    "block_comment": "This block of code is to design a synchronous register for a rotational shift counter in a digital system. It uses a positive edge triggered clock and active low reset condition. On the occurrence of a negative edge on `reset_n`, it resets the shift rotational counter `E_shift_rot_cnt`, setting it to an initial condition of zero. In contrast, if there is no reset, each positive edge of the clock results in the current value of `E_shift_rot_cnt` being updated from `E_shift_rot_cnt_nxt`, thus facilitating the shift operation."
