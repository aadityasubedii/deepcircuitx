    "block_comment": "The block assigns the value of 'fifo_read_mux' to 'fifo_head'. This is done using an 'assign' statement in Verilog, which continuously drives the value of 'fifo_read_mux' into 'fifo_head'. This means that 'fifo_head' will always hold the current value of 'fifo_read_mux', suggesting that 'fifo_head' is likely the pointer which keeps track of the first element in the fifo."
