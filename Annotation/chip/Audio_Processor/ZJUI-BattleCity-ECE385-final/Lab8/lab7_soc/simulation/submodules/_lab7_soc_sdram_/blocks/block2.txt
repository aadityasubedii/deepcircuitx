Comment: 
This block assigns a specific 24-bit hexadecimal code to `txt_code` based on the value of `cmd_code`. The assignment is implemented by a series of conditional (ternary) operations. The `cmd_code` is an input of 3 bits and depending on its value, ranging from 0 (`3'h0`) to 7 (`3'h7`), a corresponding 24-bit hexadecimal value is assigned to `txt_code`. If `cmd_code` does not match any of the defined options, `24'h424144` is assigned to `txt_code` as a default value.
