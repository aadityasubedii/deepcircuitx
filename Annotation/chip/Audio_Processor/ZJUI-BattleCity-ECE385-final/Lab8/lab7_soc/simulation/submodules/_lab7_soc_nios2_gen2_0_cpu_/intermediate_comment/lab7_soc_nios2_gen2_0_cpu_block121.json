    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing the state of `R_ctrl_break` under different conditions. Implemented as a sequential logic block, it is triggered by either a rising edge of `clk` or a falling edge of `reset_n`. If `reset_n` falls, the value of `R_ctrl_break` is set to 0, effectively providing synchronous reset capability. However, if there's a positive edge in `clk` and `R_en` is true, `R_ctrl_break` is updated to the future state `R_ctrl_break_nxt`, thus following the pipeline control state transitions."
