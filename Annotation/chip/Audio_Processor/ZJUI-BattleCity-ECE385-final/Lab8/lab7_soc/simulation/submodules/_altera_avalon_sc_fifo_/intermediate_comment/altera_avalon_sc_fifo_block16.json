    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for determining if a certain buffer or storage is almost empty. It does so by using a conditional statement (if-else) to check a flag `USE_ALMOST_EMPTY_IF`. If this flag is set, the `almost_empty_data` gets assigned a value based on whether the `fill_level` is less than or equal to the `almost_empty_threshold`. This check is indicating whether the fill level of a certain buffer or storage has dropped below a predefined threshold. If the flag `USE_ALMOST_EMPTY_IF` is not set, meaning we do not need to check if the buffer is almost empty, `almost_empty_data` is assigned a default value of 0."
