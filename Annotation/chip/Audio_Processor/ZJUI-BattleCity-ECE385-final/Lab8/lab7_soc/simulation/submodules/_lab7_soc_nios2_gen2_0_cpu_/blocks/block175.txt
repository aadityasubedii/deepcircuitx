Comment: 
This block of Verilog code serves as a synchronous reset and control register interface. It comes into play at the rising edge of the clock signal or the falling edge of the reset signal. If the reset signal is active low, the control read data ('W_control_rd_data') will be reset to 0. Conversely, if the block is not under reset, it chooses the binary value between the status register ('W_status_reg') and the control read data stored in the previous stage ('E_control_rd_data') based on the control instruction ('D_ctrl_intr_inst'), then assigns the chosen value to 'W_control_rd_data'.
