    "block_comment": "The block of code sets the values of the signals `out_startofpacket` and `out_endofpacket`. If the else condition is not met, these signals are assigned a slice of the `out_payload` vector, specifically the bits from `DATA_WIDTH` to `DATA_WIDTH + PACKET_WIDTH - 1`. If the condition triggers the else block, both `out_startofpacket` and `out_endofpacket` are assigned a value of `2'b0`."
