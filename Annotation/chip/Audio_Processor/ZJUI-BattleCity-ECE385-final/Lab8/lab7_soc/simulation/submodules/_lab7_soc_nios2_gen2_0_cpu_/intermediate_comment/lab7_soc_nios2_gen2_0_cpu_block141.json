    "block_comment": "This block of code is defining an assigning operation. In detail, the Verilog code, `assign D_ctrl_custom_multi = 1'b0;`, is assigning a constant value of '0' to the wire `D_ctrl_custom_multi`. The keyword `assign` is used in Verilog to specify that the subsequent logic expression, in this case a constant '0', should always be applied to the specified wire or register. Here, it is ensuring that the wire `D_ctrl_custom_multi` always holds the binary value '0'. As such, this block initiates `D_ctrl_custom_multi` to a default state."
