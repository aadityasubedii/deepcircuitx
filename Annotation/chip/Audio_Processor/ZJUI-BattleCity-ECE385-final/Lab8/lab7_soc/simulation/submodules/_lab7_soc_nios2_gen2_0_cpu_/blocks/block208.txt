This block seems to manage the next state of the write operation control signal in a data memory element. It primarily checks a number of conditions and sets the 'd_write_nxt' signal accordingly. The conditions checked are if the control state is active and (either control state exception is not raised or up-ex monotonic state is employed) and if a new instruction has been issued and no valid signal is received from the ECC check of the register file. Alongside, it also checks whether the current state of the write operation and the wait-request signal. Based on these conditions, the next state of the write operation signal is decided.
