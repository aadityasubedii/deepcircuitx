This block of code designs a synchronous reset and data-flow for the variable "R_ctrl_custom_multi" in Verilog RTL. When there's a rising edge in clock (clk) or a falling edge in reset signal "reset_n", the logic inside the block will be executed. If "reset_n" is asserted (i.e., low), "R_ctrl_custom_multi" is reset to 0. Otherwise, if enable signal "R_en" is high, "R_ctrl_custom_multi" takes the value of "R_ctrl_custom_multi_nxt" from the next state.
