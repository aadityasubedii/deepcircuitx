This block of code is responsible for controlling direct jumps in the register identified as "R_ctrl_jmp_direct". When the negative reset is triggered ('reset_n' equals 0), the register "R_ctrl_jmp_direct" is reset to 0. However, if the reset is not triggered, and the enable control signal 'R_en' is true, the present value of register "R_ctrl_jmp_direct" is updated to its next state value, "R_ctrl_jmp_direct_nxt", on the rising edge of the clock cycle.
