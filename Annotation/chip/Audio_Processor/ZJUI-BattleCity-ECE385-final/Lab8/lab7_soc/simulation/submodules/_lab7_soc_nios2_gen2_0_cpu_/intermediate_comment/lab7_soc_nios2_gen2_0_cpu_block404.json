    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a constant value to the 'sync_timer' variable. In this specific line of Verilog RTL code, the 'sync_timer' variable is assigned with a 7-bit decimal value of 1. It suggests that 'sync_timer' is serving as a synchronous timer which is initialized or reset to a known state, probably forming a fundamental part in the timing system of a digital circuit. This line forms the base setup or reset condition for the larger functionality that 'sync_timer' might be a part of."
