    "block_comment": "The block of code manages reading data from a two-entry memory. The code block utilizes an 'always' block that activates upon changes in the variables 'entry_0', 'entry_1', or 'rd_address'. It employs a switch-case statement to handle the read address ('rd_address'). For a read address of 0, it assigns 'entry_0' to 'rd_data'. For a read address of 1, it assigns 'entry_1' to 'rd_data'. If the value of the read address is neither 0 nor 1, the code does not perform any action due to an empty default case."
