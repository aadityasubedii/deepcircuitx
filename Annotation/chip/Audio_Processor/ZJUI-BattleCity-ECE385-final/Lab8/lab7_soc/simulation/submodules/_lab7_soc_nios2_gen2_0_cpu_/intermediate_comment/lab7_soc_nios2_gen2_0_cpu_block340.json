    "block_comment": "The given block manages a FIFO buffer reset operation and its update under certain control flags in a synchronous design. On encountering a negative edge of the 'reset_n' signal, the 'fifo_13' buffer is reset to zero. When 'reset_n' signal isn't low and an enable signal 'fifo_13_enable' is high on the positive edge of clock 'clk', the 'fifo_13' buffer is loaded with the value from 'fifo_13_mux'."
