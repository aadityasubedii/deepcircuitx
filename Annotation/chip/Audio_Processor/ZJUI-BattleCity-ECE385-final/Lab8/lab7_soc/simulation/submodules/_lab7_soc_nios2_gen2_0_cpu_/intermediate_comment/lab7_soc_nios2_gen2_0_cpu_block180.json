    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for updating the value of the 'av_ld_byte3_data' register. It operates synchronously with the positive edge of the system clock or the negative edge of the reset signal. If the reset signal is active (low), the 'av_ld_byte3_data' register will be cleared to zero, effectively resetting it. However, during a positive clock edge, if the reset signal is not active, 'av_ld_byte3_data' takes the next state 'av_ld_byte3_data_nxt'."
