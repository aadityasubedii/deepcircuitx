    "block_comment": "This block primarily handles the reset and update of the 'R_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16' register. The register is asynchronously cleared to zero when a negative edge reset signal 'reset_n' is received. During the positive edge of the clock and when the enable signal 'R_en' is high, the register is updated with the value of 'R_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16_nxt'."
