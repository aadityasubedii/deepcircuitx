The code block generates a sync interval value based on the condition of the sync codes, handling different scenarios. The sync interval is computed as a concatenation of different conditions of sync codes. Conditions include situation when both sync codes are high (sync_code[1] & sync_code[0]), where sync code 1 is high and sync code 0 is low (sync_code[1] & ~sync_code[0]), and where sync code 0 is high and sync code 1 is low (~sync_code[1] & sync_code[0]). The padded zeros are used for maintaining the length of the resultant bit pattern.
