    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the state of the 'read' signal based on the system clock (clk) and asynchronous reset (jrst_n). Upon encountering a rising edge of the clock or a falling edge of 'jrst_n', it checks if 'jrst_n' is zero (signifying a reset condition). If this condition holds true, the 'read' signal is set to zero. If not, it checks whether 'read' is true. If 'read' is true, it assigns the value of 'waitrequest' to 'read'. Otherwise, it assigns the value of 'read_nxt' to 'read'."
