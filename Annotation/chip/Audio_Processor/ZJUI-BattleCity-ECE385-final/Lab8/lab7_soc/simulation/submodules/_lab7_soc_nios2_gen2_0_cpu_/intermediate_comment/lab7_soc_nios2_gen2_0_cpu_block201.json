    "block_comment": "This block manages the alignment cycle for data loading for a given Verilog Module. It uses a ternary operation where if the 'av_ld_getting_data' flag is true, it sets the 'av_ld_align_cycle_nxt' to 0. Otherwise, it increments the 'av_ld_align_cycle_nxt' by 1. This is typically used in situations where data alignment is crucial for the subsequent operations."
