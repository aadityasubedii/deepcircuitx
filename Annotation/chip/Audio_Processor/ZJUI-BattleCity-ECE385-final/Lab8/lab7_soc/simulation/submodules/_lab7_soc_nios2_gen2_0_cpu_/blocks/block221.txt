This code block is responsible for assigning a specific value to the E_shift_rot_fill_bit. It performs this function using a conditional statement based on the R_ctrl_shift_logical and R_ctrl_rot_right control flags. If the logical Shift control flag, R_ctrl_shift_logical, is high, it assigns the binary value '0' to E_shift_rot_fill_bit. If it's low, then the control flag for right rotation, R_ctrl_rot_right, is evaluated. If the latter is high, the least significant bit of E_shift_rot_result is used, otherwise the 31st bit of E_shift_rot_result is chosen.
