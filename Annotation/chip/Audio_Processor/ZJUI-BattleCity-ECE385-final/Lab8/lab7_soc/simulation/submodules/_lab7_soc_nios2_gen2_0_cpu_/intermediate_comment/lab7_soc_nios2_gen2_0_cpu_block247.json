    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for determining the write data for a register file (W_rf_wr_data). It does this by using the ternary operator (?:) to decide between two choices. If the control load signal (R_ctrl_ld) is high, it takes the aligned and filtered load data (av_ld_data_aligned_filtered) to write to the register file. On the other hand, if the control load signal is low, it writes another data (W_wr_data) to the register file."
