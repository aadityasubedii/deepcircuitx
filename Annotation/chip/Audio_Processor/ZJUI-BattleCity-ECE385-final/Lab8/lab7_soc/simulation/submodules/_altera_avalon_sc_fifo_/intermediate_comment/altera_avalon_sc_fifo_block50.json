    "block_comment": "This block generates a read signal in a Verilog design. The read signal is created by `&&` (AND) operation on three other signals: `internal_out_ready`, `internal_out_valid`, and `ok_to_forward`. The `read` signal will only be high if all three signals are high, indicating that the internal output is ready and valid, and the data is okay to forward. The use of the `assign` keyword implies that the value of `read` will be updated continuously based on the status of the three input signals."
