    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of `W_status_reg_pie` to `W_status_reg`. It essentially operates as a wire assignment in Verilog, creating a connection between the two registers. This assignment occurs continuously, meaning `W_status_reg` always reflects the current value of the `W_status_reg_pie`. The use of `assign` shows that this is a combinational logic block, therefore, changes in the value of `W_status_reg_pie` will immediately affect `W_status_reg`."
