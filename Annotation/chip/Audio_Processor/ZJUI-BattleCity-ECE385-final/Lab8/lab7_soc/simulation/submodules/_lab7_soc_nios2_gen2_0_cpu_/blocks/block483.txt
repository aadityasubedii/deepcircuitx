Comment: 
This block evaluates if at least one of the `goto1` signals from the `xbrk` are set to high. It accomplishes this by using a bitwise OR operation to monitor the signals `xbrk0_goto1_hit`, `xbrk1_goto1_hit`, `xbrk2_goto1_hit` and `xbrk3_goto1_hit`. If any of the `xbrkN_goto1_hit` signals are `1`, the `xbrk_goto1_hit` will be `1`, else it will be `0`.
