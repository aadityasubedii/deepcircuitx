    "block_comment": "This single line of Verilog code is doing an assignment operation, specifically a continuous assignment. Continuous assignment refers to the ongoing assignment o\\f values from the expression on the right side to the target on the left side. Here, the line assigns the current value of `D_ctrl_ld` to `R_ctrl_ld_nxt` in the next cycle. The `_nxt` postfix often indicates what the variable will become in the next cycle."
