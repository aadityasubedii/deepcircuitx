This Verilog block assigns the constant DEPTH to the wire depth32. It's a simple assignment operation that integrates a given constant DEPTH into the design by assigning its value to depth32, which avoids the hardcoding of this constant in multiple locations of the code and allows for easier changes if required. The outcome of depth32 can be used in the succeeding logic gates or calculations.
