Comment: 
The block of code is used for debugging in a memory slave configuration. It functions by assigning the inverse(~) of the 'reset_n' signal to 'debug_mem_slave_reset'. This essentially means that whenever 'reset_n' is active, 'debug_mem_slave_reset' becomes inactive and vice versa. The operation, implemented via the Verilog 'assign' keyword, happens every time 'reset_n' changes its state.
