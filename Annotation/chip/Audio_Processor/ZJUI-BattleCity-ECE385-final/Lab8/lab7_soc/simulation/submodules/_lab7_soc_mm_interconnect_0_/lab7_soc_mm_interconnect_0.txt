Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements an interconnect for a SoC, managing communication between multiple masters and slaves.
It uses a network of translators, routers, multiplexers, and clock crossers to handle address decoding,
data routing, and clock domain synchronization. The interconnect supports multiple simultaneous transactions,
providing flexible and efficient communication infrastructure for the SoC design.
