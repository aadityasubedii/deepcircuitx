This Verilog code block is performing a wire assignment operation. Specifically, it is assigning the value of register `R_dst_regnum` to the wire `W_dst_regnum`. The effect of this is that any changes to the content of `R_dst_regnum` register will be mirrored on the `W_dst_regnum` wire. This enables seamless, real-time tracking or duplication of data between these two elements within the hardware system.
