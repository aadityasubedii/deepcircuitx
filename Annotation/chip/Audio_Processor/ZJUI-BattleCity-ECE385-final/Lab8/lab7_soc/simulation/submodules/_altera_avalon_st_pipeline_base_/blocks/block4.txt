Comment: 
This code block is essentially a pipeline buffer for two stages of data processing. It synchronously responds to positive edge of a clock signal and a reset signal, setting 'data0' and 'data1' registers to 0 on reset. Otherwise, it assigns new input 'in_data' to 'data0' when the first pipeline stage is not full ('full0' flag is not set). For the second stage, if it's not full ('full1' flag is not set) or if there's an outbound data request while valid data is available, 'data1' is assigned either the value of 'data0' if the first stage is full, or 'in_data' otherwise.
