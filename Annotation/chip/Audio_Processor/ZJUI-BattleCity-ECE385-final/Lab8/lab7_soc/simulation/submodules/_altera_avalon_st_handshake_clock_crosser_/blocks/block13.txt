Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for assigning input signals to specific slices of a payload packet depending on several conditional parameters. Initially, if the 'PACKET_WIDTH' is non-zero, it assigns 'startofpacket' and 'endofpacket' status signals to the first section of the payload. If 'USE_CHANNEL' is true, a channel identifier 'in_channel' is appended to the payload. In the case when 'EMPTY_WIDTH' is given, an 'empty' signal 'in_empty' is attached right after the previously added data. Lastly, if the error signal is used ('USE_ERROR'), it assigns the 'in_error' signal to a final section in the payload packet. Notice that each new data is concatenated to the right of the previous data, expanding the width of the 'in_payload' accordingly.
