    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to reset the synchronization chain. It achieves this by setting `r_sync_rst_chain`, a register with the same width as the length of the assertion chain (`ASSERTION_CHAIN_LENGTH`), to all ones (`1'b1`). This effectively prepares all the stages in the chain to be in a 'reset' state."
