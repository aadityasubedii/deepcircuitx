The block of code is a debugging mechanism for the test bench setup of a lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu system. In the wake of a clock event, if the system is not in reset mode, the block checks if any input read (i_read) value is undetermined (1'bx). If so, it flags an error message indicating the exact time of the occurrence and halts the system for further debugging.
