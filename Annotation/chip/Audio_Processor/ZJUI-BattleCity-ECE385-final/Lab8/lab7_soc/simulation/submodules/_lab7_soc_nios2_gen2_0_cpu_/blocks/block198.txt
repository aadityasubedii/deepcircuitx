The block of code is used for determining what the next state of `av_ld_waiting_for_data` should be. The new state of `av_ld_waiting_for_data` is decided based on its current state, `R_ctrl_ld`, and `E_new_inst` status. If `av_ld_waiting_for_data` is currently true, then the next state should be the complement of `av_ld_getting_data`. Otherwise, the next state should be the logical AND result of `R_ctrl_ld` and `E_new_inst`.
