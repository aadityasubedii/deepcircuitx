Comment: 
This block of code assigns the value of a 29-bit address to `W_mem_baddr` from the output of the ALU (`W_alu_result`). The specified bit range [28 : 0] defines the bitwidth of the resulting address. Thus, the block retrieves a 29-bit portion from `W_alu_result` (starting from bit 0 through to bit 28) and assigns it to `W_mem_baddr`.
