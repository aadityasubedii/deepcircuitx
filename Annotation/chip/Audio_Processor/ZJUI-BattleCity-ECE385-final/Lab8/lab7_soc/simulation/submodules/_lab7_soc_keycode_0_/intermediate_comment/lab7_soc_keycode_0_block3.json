    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a synchronous write operation in a memory unit or a register. It is governed by a clock signal and can be asynchronously reset. Upon receiving a negative 'reset_n' signal, the output data ('data_out') is reset to 0. However, if the chip is selected ('chipselect'), a write operation is not ongoing ('write_n'), and the 'address' equals 0, the lower 16-bits of the 'writedata' input are taken and stored in 'data_out'."
