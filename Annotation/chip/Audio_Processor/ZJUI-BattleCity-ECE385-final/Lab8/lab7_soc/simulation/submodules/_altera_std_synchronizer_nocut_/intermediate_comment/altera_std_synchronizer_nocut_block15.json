    "block_comment": "This block of code acts as a flip-flop or latch, storing input data `din` on the rising edge of the clock `clk`, or resetting to a defined value upon receiving a low reset signal `reset_n`. On encountering a negative edge of `reset_n`, the latch is reset to either '0' or '1' depending on the `rst_value` signal. During positive clock edges, when `reset_n` is not active(low), the input data `din` is assigned to `din_last`, ensuring that `din_last` will retain the value of `din` as long as the reset signal is not triggered."
