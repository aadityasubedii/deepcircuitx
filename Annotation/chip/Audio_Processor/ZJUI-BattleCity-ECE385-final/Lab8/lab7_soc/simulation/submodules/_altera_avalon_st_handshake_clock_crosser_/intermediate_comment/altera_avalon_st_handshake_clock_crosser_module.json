    "module": "Module-level comment: The altera_avalon_st_handshake_clock_crosser module is designed for clock crossing handshaking in Avalon-ST interfaces. It uses various inputs and outputs including control and data signals. The module internally utilizes an altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser instance for communication handling. It separates incoming data aggregates aptly into an 'in_payload' signal, which is processed by the clock_crosser instance and re-aggregated into an 'out_payload' signal. Features such as channel info, error notifications, and transmission indications can be adapted based on the requirements. This design ensures proper synchronization, flow control, and data packet handling."
