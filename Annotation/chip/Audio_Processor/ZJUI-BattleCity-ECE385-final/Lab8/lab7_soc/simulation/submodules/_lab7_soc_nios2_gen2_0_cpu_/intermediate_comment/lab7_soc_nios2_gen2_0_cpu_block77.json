    "block_comment": "This block is for signal assignment. The provided code block is assigning the value of 'D_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot' to 'R_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot_nxt'. It means the same data or state that is currently in 'D_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot' would be moved to 'R_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot_nxt' in the next clock cycle. This operation continues for every clock cycle and could be taken as essential part for a state transition in a Finite State Machine (FSM) or synchronizing asynchronous inputs to the design. In essence, it's passing or forwarding immediate short bit constant control signals for further processing or computation elsewhere."
