This block of code assigns the value of the signal 'E_logic_result_is_0' to the signal 'E_eq'. The assign statement in Verilog RTL signifies continuous assignment, meaning the right-side expression's value is always evaluated and the resultant value is continuously assigned to the signal on the left side. Therefore, as soon as 'E_logic_result_is_0' gets updated, the change will be reflected on 'E_eq'. The use of assign statements in Verilog typically signifies combinational logic.
