    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating the state of the control reset register in the next clock cycle. The update is achieved by assigning the current state of the D_ctrl_crst register to the R_ctrl_crst_nxt register using the 'assign' statement in Verilog. This ensures that the R_ctrl_crst_nxt register is ready with the updated state when the next clock cycle comes."
