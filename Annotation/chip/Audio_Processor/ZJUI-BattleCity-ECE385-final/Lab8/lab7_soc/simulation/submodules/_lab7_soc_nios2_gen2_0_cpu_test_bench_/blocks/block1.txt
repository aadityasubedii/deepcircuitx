This block handles edge-triggered resets and warning messages. When a negative edge occurs on the reset line (`reset_n == 0`), it doesn't perform any action. However, in the presence of a positive clock edge, if `W_valid` and `R_wr_dst_reg` are high, it checks if the exclusive OR of all the bits of `W_wr_data` equals to 1'bx. If this situation occurs, a warning message ("WARNING: lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_test_bench/W_wr_data is 'x'") is logged along with the current simulation time.
