    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for assigning the next value to `W_bstatus_reg_inst_nxt`. If `R_ctrl_break` signal is true, then the value of `W_status_reg` is assigned, else if signal `E_wrctl_bstatus` is true, the least significant bit of `E_src1` is assigned. If none of these conditions are met, the existing value of `W_bstatus_reg` is retained by `W_bstatus_reg_inst_nxt`. This is achieved using conditional (ternary) operators in Verilog, which makes it an efficient design."
