    "block_comment": "The function performs calculation of the logarithm base 2, specifically the ceiling value, of an input integer value (log2ceil). It initializes two variables - i and log2ceil - to zero and incrementally multiplies i by 2 (left shifts by 1 in binary representation), while simultaneously incrementing log2ceil by 1, until i is no longer less than the input value, thus reaching the smallest power of 2 which is greater than or equal to the input, and providing its log base 2 as output."
