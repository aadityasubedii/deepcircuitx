Comment: 
This block of Verilog code defines a shift register with reset functionality. The block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal or the negative edge of the reset signal. If the reset signal is low, the register, dreg, is cleared and set to zeros. If not, new data input ('din_s1') is concatenated onto the lower bits of dreg, effectively implementing shifting behavior. The width of shift register corresponds to 'depth'-1 bits, creating a shift register of configurable size based on value of 'depth'.
