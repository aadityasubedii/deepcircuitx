    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a register `R_dst_regnum` that synchronizes with the rising edge of the clock `clk` or falling edge of the `reset_n` signal. Upon a reset (when `reset_n` is 0), `R_dst_regnum` is set to 0. Otherwise, during each clock cycle, `R_dst_regnum` takes the value stored in `D_dst_regnum`."
