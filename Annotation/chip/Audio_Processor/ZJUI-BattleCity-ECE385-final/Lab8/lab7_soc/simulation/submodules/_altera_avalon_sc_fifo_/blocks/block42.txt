Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code manages a shift operation in a storage element with a depth defined by "DEPTH". The loop operates from the second index (i=1) to the penultimate index (i=DEPTH-1) of the storage or memory entity, effectively shifting the data from a higher index to an immediately lower index within the storage every cycle it runs. The loop increment is in steps of 1, ensuring each index in the given range is addressed. The label 'storage_logic' is used for the block of storage shifting operations that follow this line of code.
