This block primarily handles the control signals regarding data forwarding and error handling for a certain system. The 'ok_to_forward' signal is always set to high, indicating the data can be always forwarded. Similarly, the 'drop_on_error' signal is set low, implying errors do not cause data drops. Lastly, the 'curr_sop_ptr' register is determined based on the ADDR_WIDTH of the implemented system. If the ADDR_WIDTH is less than or equal to 1, 'curr_sop_ptr' is set to logic 0. Otherwise, it is assigned a bit width equal to (ADDR_WIDTH - 1), filled with logic 0s. This adaptation ensures that the size of 'curr_sop_ptr' dynamically changes with the address width of the system.
