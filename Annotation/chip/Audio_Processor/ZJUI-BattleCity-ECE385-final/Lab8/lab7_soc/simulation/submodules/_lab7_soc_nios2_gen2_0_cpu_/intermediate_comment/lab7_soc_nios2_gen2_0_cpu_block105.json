    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the bitwise OR operation of 'D_op_srai' and 'D_op_sra' to 'D_ctrl_shift_right_arith'. This is an arithmetic shift right operation in a datapath controller, typically used in microprocessor designs. The purpose is to shift the bits of the operands to the right and fill the vacated bit positions based on the sign of the number, to perform a fast multiplication or division by a power of two."
