Comment: 
This line of code is an assignment operation in a Verilog RTL code. The function of this block is to assign the `dbrk_hit3_latch` variable a value of `1'b0`, which in the context of digital systems design, stands for a single-bit binary number of 0. The implementation in this case is a simple direct assignment operation, with no conditional checks or looping structures involved. This means that the `dbrk_hit3_latch` will always be set to 0 during the operation of the digital design. The purpose of this could range from initializing the `dbrk_hit3_latch` to ensuring it is reset at every clock cycle or stays low in a specific design configuration.
