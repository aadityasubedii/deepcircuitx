    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a value to the 'take_action_oci_intr_mask_reg' register. The assigned value is the bitwise 'AND' operation result between 'write_strobe' and 'oci_reg_01_addressed'. Therefore, the register 'take_action_oci_intr_mask_reg' will be updated only when both 'write_strobe' signal is active and 'oci_reg_01_addressed' is addressed, ensuring specific conditions before updating."
