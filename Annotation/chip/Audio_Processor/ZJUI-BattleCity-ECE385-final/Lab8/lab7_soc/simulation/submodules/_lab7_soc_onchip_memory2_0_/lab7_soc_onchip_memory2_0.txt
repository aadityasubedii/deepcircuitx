Module-level comment: This module, lab7_soc_onchip_memory2_0, represents an on-chip memory unit in a SoC, using a single-port synchronous RAM initialized by a hex file. It accepts control and data inputs including address, byteenable, chipselect, clk, reset, write, and writedata. The module provides read data as output. Internally, write operations are controlled by wren signal and clock is managed by clocken0. This structure enables efficient read/write operations to the memory module within a digital SoC context.
