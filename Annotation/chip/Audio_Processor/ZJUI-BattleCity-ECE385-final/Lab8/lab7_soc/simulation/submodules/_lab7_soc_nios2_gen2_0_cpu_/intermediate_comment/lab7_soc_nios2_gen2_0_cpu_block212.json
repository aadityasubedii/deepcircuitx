    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns data to signal E_st_data based on the conditions of D_ctrl_mem8 and D_ctrl_mem16. The process employs multiplexing to accommodate different data sizes. Specifically, when the condition D_ctrl_mem8 is true, signal E_st_data is assigned by concatenating R_stb_data four times. On the other hand, when D_ctrl_mem16 is true, E_st_data is instead assigned by concatenating R_sth_data twice. When both conditions are false, R_stw_data is directly assigned to E_st_data. This flexibility enables the block of code to handle different data width scenarios."
