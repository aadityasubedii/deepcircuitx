Comment: 
The given block of code describes a sequential logic which responds to a positive edge of a clock signal or a negative edge of a manual reset signal. The functionality of this block is to control a state variable `W_up_ex_mon_state` based on different conditions. On the event of a negative edge of `reset_n`, `W_up_ex_mon_state` is reset to zero. On a positive clock edge, if the enable signal `R_en` is high, `W_up_ex_mon_state` gets updated. For the update, if `R_ctrl_ld_ex` and `W_valid` are high, it sets to '1', if either `D_op_eret` and `W_valid` or `R_ctrl_st_ex` and `W_valid` are high, it resets to '0', else it retains the old state.
