This block of Verilog code is essentially a clock-driven register that holds the control signal for the ALU's subtract operation. As for its working mechanism, it becomes active on the positive edge of the clock or the negation (the falling edge) of the reset signal (reset_n)}. If the reset_n is set to zero, it resets the control signal (R_ctrl_alu_subtract) to zero. On the other hand, when the 'R_en' signal is high (possibly signaling the ALU's operational state), the current state of the Ctrl ALU subtract operation (R_ctrl_alu_subtract) is updated to its next state (R_ctrl_alu_subtract_nxt) based on some computation or operation not defined in this block.
