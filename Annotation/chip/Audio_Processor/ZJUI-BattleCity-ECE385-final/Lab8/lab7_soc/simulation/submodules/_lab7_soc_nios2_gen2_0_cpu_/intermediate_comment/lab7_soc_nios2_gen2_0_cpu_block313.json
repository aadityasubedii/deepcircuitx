    "block_comment": "The block of code handles data reading from OCI registers. It achieves this through conditional operations, sending out different data depending on the addressed register. If the 0th register (oci_reg_00_addressed) is addressed, it concatenates and sends a 32 bit vector where the 31st to 4th bit is '0', followed by bit values of oci_single_step_mode, monitor_go, monitor_ready, and monitor_error. If the 1st register (oci_reg_01_addressed) is addressed, it simply sends out the value of oci_ienable."
