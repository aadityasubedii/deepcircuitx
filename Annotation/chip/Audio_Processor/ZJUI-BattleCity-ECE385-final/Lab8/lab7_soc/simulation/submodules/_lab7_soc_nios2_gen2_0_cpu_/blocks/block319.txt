This line of Verilog code is designing a logic gate operation for a write strobe. This operation occurs when both 'write' and 'debugaccess' are logically true. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used to model the combinational logic such that 'write_strobe' will receive the result of the AND operation between 'write' and 'debugaccess'.
