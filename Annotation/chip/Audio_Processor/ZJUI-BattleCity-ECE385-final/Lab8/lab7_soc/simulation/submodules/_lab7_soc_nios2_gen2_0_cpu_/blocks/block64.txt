This block represents a flip-flop with an asynchronous reset. After every positive edge of the clock or a negative edge of the reset, the block updates the control line for signed comparison in the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The value for the control line (R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison) is reset to 0 if reset_n is 0 (asynchronous reset), and if the flip-flop is enabled (R_en is 1), it is updated to the next state (R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison_nxt) at the next positive edge of the clock.
