Comment: 
The block of code is assigning the value of the 'reset_n' signal to the 'jrst_n' signal. This is achieved through the use of the assign statement in Verilog, which sets 'jrst_n' equal to 'reset_n'. The assigned value will depend on the current state of 'reset_n', effectively making 'jrst_n' a mirror of 'reset_n'.
