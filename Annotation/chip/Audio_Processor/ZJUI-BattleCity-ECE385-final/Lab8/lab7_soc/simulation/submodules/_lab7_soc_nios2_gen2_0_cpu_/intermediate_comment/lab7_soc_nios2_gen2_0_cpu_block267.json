    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog assigns the value to D_compare_op based on whether D_is_opx_inst holds true. If D_is_opx_inst is true, D_compare_op receives the value in the bit-fields [4:3] of D_iw_opx; otherwise, it fetches the value from the same bit-fields in D_iw_op. The ternary operator is used to achieve this conditional assignment."
