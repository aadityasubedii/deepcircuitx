    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code assigns the value of `W_mem_baddr` to `d_address`. It's essentially a simple wiring where the value at the source `W_mem_baddr` is transferred to the target 'd_address'. This way, 'd_address' will always hold the exact value present in 'W_mem_baddr'. This is commonly used when the exact state of a wire or reg needs to be replicated, enabling data propagation through the design."
