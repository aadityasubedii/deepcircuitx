    "spec": "Module name: lab7_soc_onchip_memory2_0. \n\nModule specification: The lab7_soc_onchip_memory2_0 module is designed to represent an on-chip memory unit in a System on Chip (SoC). The module uses a synchronous RAM (Random Access Memory) named 'the_altsyncram', which is initialized through a hex file and is tailored for single-port memory operations. \n\nThe input ports for this module are: address (indicating the memory location), byteenable (determining byte lanes access), chipselect (enabling the memory module), clk (the clock reference), clken (enabling the clock), freeze (pausing all operations), reset (resetting the module's output and internal states), reset_req (requesting reset), write (controlling write operations) and writedata (the data to be written). The module has a single output port, readdata (the data read from memory).\n\nThree internal signals are defined: wren (write enable signal, active when both chipselect and write are high), clocken0 (enabling the clock when clken is high and reset_req is low), and readdata (holding the data fetched from the memory). \n\nThe module mainly features a single RAM block 'the_altsyncram', whose parameters are defined to determine memory attributes such as operation mode, memory size, read and write modes. These attributes and others collectively drive the memory functioning tailored as per design requirements. Overall, this module is essential in performing read/write operations in a digital SoC context, offering a streamlined management of memory operations.",
