This block of code implements a memory block status check module in a Verilog RTL design. It is sensitive to the positive edge of both the clock signal and the reset signal. When reset is triggered, it sets the 'empty' flag to 1 (indicating the memory block is empty) and 'full' flag to 0 (indicating the memory block is not full). In a normal working state (no reset), it updates 'empty' and 'full' statuses based on 'next_empty' and 'next_full' signals, likely generated by other memory operation logic checking the state of the buffer in the next clock cycle.
