This block of code manages memory usage tracking in a system. Upon a positive clock edge or a system reset, it checks whether a write or read has occurred. If system reset is active, it sets the last element of the memory usage array (`mem_used`) to 0, indicating that no memory has been used. If not in reset and a write or read operation is executed, the memory usage is updated. Specifically, a write command copies the penultimate element of the `mem_used` array to the last element, effectively decrementing the memory used.
