Comment: 
This block of RTL code regulates the increment value of a FIFO write pointer. The code works based on the availability of free elements 'ge2_free', 'ge3_free', and the count of input elements 'input_tm_cnt'. If three elements are free and input count is also three, the write pointer will increment by three. If at least two elements are free and input count is two or more, the write pointer increments by two. If there is at least one input count, the pointer increments by one. In any other scenario, the write pointer doesn't increment.
