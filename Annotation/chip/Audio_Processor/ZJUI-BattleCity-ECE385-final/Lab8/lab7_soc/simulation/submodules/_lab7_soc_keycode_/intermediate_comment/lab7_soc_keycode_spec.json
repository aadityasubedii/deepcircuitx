    "spec": "Module name: lab7_soc_keycode. \n\nModule specification: The lab7_soc_keycode module is a system on chip (SoC) hardware element that serves as an input-output interface. Its function is to process input signals such as an address, chipselect, clock, reset, write operation details, and written data, and generate output and read data. The module consists of multiple internal signals including clk_en, a wire signal which allows for all clock enabled operations; data_out, an 8-bit reg signal that stores the lower eight bits of writedata when required conditions are met; out_port, a wire signal that mirrors data_out; read_mux_out, which performs a multiplexing operation based on the address; and readdata, a 32-bit wire signal mainly used for read operations. Input ports include address, chipselect, clk, reset_n, write_n, and writedata that play crucial roles in control and data flow within the module, whereas output ports consist of out_port and readdata that are used for transmitting the outcome of decoder operations. The Verilog code is structured with an initialization section, active logic conditionals within a clock-driven always block, and assignment statements that link the input and internal signals to the appropriate outputs.",

It basically receives input signals, such as address, chipselect, clock, reset, write operation details and written data. It then processes these inputs based on its internal logic to generate output and read data. The internal logic of the module is set to relay the written data when the chip is selected, write operation is negated and the address is 0. Also, this module does a reset on a negative edge of the reset trigger. The outputs of this module include an 8-bit 'out_port' and a 32-bit 'readdata'. The 'clk_en' is always set to 1, allowing the clock enabled operations to always pass."
