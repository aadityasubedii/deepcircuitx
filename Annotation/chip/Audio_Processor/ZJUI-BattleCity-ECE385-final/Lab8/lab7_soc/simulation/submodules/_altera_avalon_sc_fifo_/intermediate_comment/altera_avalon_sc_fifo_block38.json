    "block_comment": "This block manages the status of a FIFO buffer, updating full and empty flags based on read and write operations. The next_full flag is set to true if the incremented write pointer is the same as the read pointer while writing into non-blocking FIFO. The next_empty flag is updated based on the location of the read and write pointers after reading from the FIFO or when writing data into the FIFO with drop on error enabled. If a simultaneous read and write occurs, it checks the starting position of pointer, setting next_empty to true if there's a match."
