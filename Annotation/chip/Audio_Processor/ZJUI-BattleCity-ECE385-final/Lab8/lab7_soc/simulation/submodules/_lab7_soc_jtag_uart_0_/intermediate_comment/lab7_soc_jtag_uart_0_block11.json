    "block_comment": "This block of RTL Verilog code is for managing Input/Output operations of a JTAG UART system. The block incorporates two FIFO memory modules - one for write operations and one for read operations. The wr_rfifo and rd_wfifo signals control whether to write or read from the FIFOs depending on full or empty conditions respectively, whereas the two internal modules (lab7_soc_jtag_uart_0_scfifo_w and lab7_soc_jtag_uart_0_scfifo_r) manage the actual writing and reading process. The description of the block's function and its implementation details were inferred based on the provided code sample, and external documents may be needed for a more accurate and customized elucidation."
