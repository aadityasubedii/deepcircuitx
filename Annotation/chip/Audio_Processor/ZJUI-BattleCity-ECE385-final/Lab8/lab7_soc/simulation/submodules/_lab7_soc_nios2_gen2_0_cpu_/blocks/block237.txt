This block implements a latch for the signal 'E_alu_sub', which can be reset asynchronously. On a falling edge of 'reset_n', 'E_alu_sub' is forced to 0. On a rising edge of 'clk' (and if 'reset_n' is high), 'E_alu_sub' takes on the logical AND of 'D_ctrl_alu_subtract' and 'R_valid', storing this new value until the next rising edge of 'clk' or falling edge of 'reset_n'.
