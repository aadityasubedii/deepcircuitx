    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the output value of a RAM block to a signal named 'q'. The implementation is direct and straightforward using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog. Here, 'q' takes the value of 'ram_q', which is presumably the output of a memory block. This code simply relates 'q' to the output of another system (RAM block), making it reflect the state or value of the external hardware, enabling monitoring or further use in a bigger system."
