The block of code controls the enable signal of an 8-depth FIFO memory. It sets the enable signal based on the write pointer of the FIFO and the availability of inputs. When the write pointer is at position 8 and there is at least one input to store (input_ge1), or when there is free space for two entries (ge2_free) and the write pointer plus one is at position 8 and there are at least two inputs available (input_ge2), or when there is free space for three entries (ge3_free), and the write pointer plus two is at position 8 with at least three inputs available (input_ge3), the FIFO enable signal is set. If none of these conditions are met, the FIFO enable signal is not set. Hence, this block handles the control logic for FIFO enabling based on the write pointer as well as the input availability.
