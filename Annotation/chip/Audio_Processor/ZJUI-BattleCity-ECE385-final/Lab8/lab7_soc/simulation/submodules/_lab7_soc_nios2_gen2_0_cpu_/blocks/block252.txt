This block of code implements a flip-flop with an active-low asynchronous reset. The flip-flop is clocked on the positive edge of the 'clk' signal. If the 'reset_n' signal is low, the output 'W1_rf_ecc_recoverable_valid' is asynchronously reset to 0. Otherwise, the value of the signal 'W_rf_ecc_recoverable_valid' is synchronously transferred to 'W1_rf_ecc_recoverable_valid' on the positive edge of the clock.
