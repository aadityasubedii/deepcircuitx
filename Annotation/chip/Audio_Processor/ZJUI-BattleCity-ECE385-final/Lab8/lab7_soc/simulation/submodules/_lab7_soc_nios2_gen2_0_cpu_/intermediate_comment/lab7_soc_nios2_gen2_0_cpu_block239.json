    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a sequential logic design that controls the value of the signal E_src2 based on the clock (`clk`) and active low reset signal (`reset_n`). It implements a flip-flop with synchronous reset. During a negative edge of `reset_n`, `E_src2` is forcibly held at '0'. In all other conditions, notably at every positive edge of the clock (`clk`), E_src2 value mimics the current value on the signal `R_src2`."
