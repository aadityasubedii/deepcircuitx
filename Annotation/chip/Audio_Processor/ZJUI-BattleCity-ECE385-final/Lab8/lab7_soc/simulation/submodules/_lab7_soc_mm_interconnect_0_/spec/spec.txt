Module name: lab7_soc_mm_interconnect_0. Module specification: This module implements an interconnect component for a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, providing complex routing and arbitration between multiple master and slave components. It has input ports for clocks, resets, and various control signals from master interfaces, and output ports for signals to slave interfaces. The module uses internal signals for routing, arbitration, and data transfer, including universal master signals, response multiplexer signals, and channel signals. The code is structured into several sections, including port declarations, internal signal declarations, and instantiations of sub-components such as translators, routers, demultiplexers, multiplexers, and clock crossers. These components work together to manage address decoding, data width conversion, clock domain synchronization, and the overall communication infrastructure of the SoC. The interconnect supports multiple simultaneous transactions and provides flexibility
