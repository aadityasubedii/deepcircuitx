    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a sequential logic circuit, specifically a flip-flop, which reacts to a rising edge of a clock signal (`clk`) or a falling edge of the reset signal (`reset_n`). In the event where `reset_n` is false (equals 0), the output `R_ctrl_ld_signed` is reset to 0. If not, then when `R_en` is true, the value of the next state variable `R_ctrl_ld_signed_nxt` is assigned to `R_ctrl_ld_signed`. This illustrates that the flip-flop operates as a load enable register, which loads the next state when `R_en` signal is high."
