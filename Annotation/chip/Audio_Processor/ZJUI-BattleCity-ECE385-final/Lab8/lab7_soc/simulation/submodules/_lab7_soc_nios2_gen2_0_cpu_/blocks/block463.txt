This code block functions as a connector, assigning the signal 'd_write' to 'cpu_d_write'. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used to drive continuous assignments to the 'cpu_d_write' variable. It's a simple wire assignment operation done at the gate level to pass the 'd_write' signal to 'cpu_d_write'.
