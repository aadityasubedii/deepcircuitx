    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the enabling of the OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) interrupt based on specific conditions. The oci_ienable register is reset to one when the reset_n signal goes low on any negative edge. When an action is registered by the take_action_oci_intr_mask_reg (in other words, when it is high), the system allows certain write operations, specifically bit-wise OR operation with the compliment of 32'b00000000000000000000000000000001, onto the oci_ienable on every positive clock edge."
