    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code is performing a simple wire assignment. The function of this code is to mirror the value of the `compute_input_tm_cnt` signal onto the `input_tm_cnt` signal, in essence, `input_tm_cnt` is assigned to whatever the value of the `compute_input_tm_cnt` signal is at any given time. This assignment happens continuously, anytime the `compute_input_tm_cnt` updates, `input_tm_cnt` immediately reflects this new value."
