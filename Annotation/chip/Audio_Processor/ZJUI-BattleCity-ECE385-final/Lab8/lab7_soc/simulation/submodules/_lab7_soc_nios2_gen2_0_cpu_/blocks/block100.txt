Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for controlling a right rotation operation based on designated conditions. Functionality is achieved using a synchronous reset and clock edge in always block. When a low active reset is detected, it sets the `R_ctrl_rot_right` value to 0, ensuring the system returns to a known initialization state. However, when reset is not invoked and if rotation operation enable signal (`R_en`) is high, it captures the next right rotation control value (`R_ctrl_rot_right_nxt`).
