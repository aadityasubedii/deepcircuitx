    "block_comment": "The block of code sets the value of `dbrk1_high_value` to zero. This assignment operation is achieved statically using the `assign` statement in Verilog, an RTL (register-transfer level) hardware description language. The `assign` statement is usually used to model combinational logic by defining the net to continuously take the right-hand-side value. In this case, the value `0` is continuously assigned to the net `dbrk1_high_value`, implying that this signal will always hold a value of zero in this design."
