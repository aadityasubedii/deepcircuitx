The block of code is responsible for assigning output data. It achieves this by mapping the `out_data` with the least significant bits of the `out_payload` determined by `DATA_WIDTH - 1` down to `0`. This implementation is straightforward and relies on the assign statement in Verilog that immediately and continuously updates `out_data` as `out_payload` changes. The width of `out_data` aligns with the size defined by `DATA_WIDTH`.
