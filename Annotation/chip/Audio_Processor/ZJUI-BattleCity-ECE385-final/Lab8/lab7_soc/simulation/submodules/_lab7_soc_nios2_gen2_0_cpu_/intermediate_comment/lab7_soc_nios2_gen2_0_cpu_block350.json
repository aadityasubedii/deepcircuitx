    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for enabling the 10th entry write operation on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) memory structure. The logic is implemented using an assignment operator that combines three conditions using logical OR operators. The first condition is for when the write pointer equals '10' and the first input ge1 is true; the second condition checks if a 'greater than two' (ge2) signal is free and if the incremented write pointer equals '10' when a second input signal ge2 is true; the third condition tests if a 'greater than three' (ge3) signal is free and if the write pointer increased by two equals '10' when third input ge3 is true."
