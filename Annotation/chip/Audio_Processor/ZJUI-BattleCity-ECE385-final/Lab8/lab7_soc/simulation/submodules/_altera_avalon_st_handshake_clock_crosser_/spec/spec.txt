Module name: altera_avalon_st_handshake_clock_crosser. 

Module specification: This module acts as a clock crossing handshaking component for Avalon-ST interfaces. It caters to a variety of inputs and outputs with signaling for packet start and end, channels, errors in signals, among others. It contains an internal altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser instance which plays a crucial role in managing the central communication interface. Module's functions are adjustable based on the requirements, for instance it can convey the start and end of transmission, inclusion of channel information, and error notifications. 

The module has several input and output ports, including in_clk, in_reset, out_clk, out_reset, in_ready, in_valid, in_data, in_channel, in_error, in_startofpacket, in_endofpacket, in_empty, out_ready, out_valid, out_data, out_channel, out_error, out_startofpacket, out_endofpacket, and out_empty. These ports carry the vital control signals and actual data signals between this module and the outer environment. Such control signals consist of clock and reset signals, ready and valid signals, and startofpacket and endofpacket signals, all of which are crucial for synchronizing operations, flow control, and delineating distinct packets of data in stream-based communication interfaces.

Internal to the module are signals in_payload and out_payload. These signals combine various incoming and outgoing data aspects into single payload events. In essence, they act like 'information buses', ensuring that different pieces of information can be holistically manipulated.

The module consists of several blocks of code. These include parameter definitions, input and output port definitions, internal signal definitions, and functional blocks. The parameter definitions set out the specifications for the module's operations. The functional blocks include a generate block that assigns incoming inputs to the 'in_payload,' and another block that makes assignments to the 'out_payload' based on input conditions. There is also a function block for calculating the ceiling value of log base 2 of an integer in the module.
