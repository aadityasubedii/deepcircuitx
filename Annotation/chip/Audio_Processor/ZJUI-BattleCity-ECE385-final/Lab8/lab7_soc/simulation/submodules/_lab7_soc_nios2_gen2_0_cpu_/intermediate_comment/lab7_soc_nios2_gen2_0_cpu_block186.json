    "block_comment": "This block handles a register update based on the provided control signals. The `av_ld_align_cycle` register gets updated on each positive edge of the clock signal or when a negative edge of the `reset_n` signal is detected. If `reset_n` equals 0, the `av_ld_align_cycle` is set to 0, effecting a reset. Otherwise, it assumes the value of `av_ld_align_cycle_nxt`, allowing for stateful sequential logic."
