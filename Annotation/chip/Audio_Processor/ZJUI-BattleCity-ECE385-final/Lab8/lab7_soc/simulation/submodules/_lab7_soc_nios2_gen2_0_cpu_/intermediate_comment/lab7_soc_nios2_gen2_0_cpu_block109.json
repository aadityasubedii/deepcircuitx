    "block_comment": "This block of RTL Verilog code implements a synchronous reset and update operation of the 'R_ctrl_retaddr' register. Upon the negative edge of 'reset_n', the 'R_ctrl_retaddr' register is reset to a zero state, ensuring a known state at system startup or when a system-wide reset condition occurs. If 'reset_n' is not asserted, the 'R_ctrl_retaddr' register captures the value of 'R_ctrl_retaddr_nxt' at each positive edge of clock 'clk' when 'R_en' is high, providing the ability for a predictable state change, usually for address redirection purposes in control flow."
