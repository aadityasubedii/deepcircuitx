    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a value to the `xbrk0_armed` signal based on the current state of specified trigger states and xbrk control signals. It uses bitwise AND operation in combination with logical OR operation to determine the value. `xbrk0_armed` is set true when either `trigger_state_0` and the 5th bit of `xbrk_ctrl0` is set or `trigger_state_1` and the 6th bit of `xbrk_ctrl0` is set, otherwise it is set to false."
