Comment: 
This block of code is linked to external interrupt handling in Verilog. It assigns a static '0' to 'is_external_interrupt', indicating that there's no external interrupt at this point in the design. This assignment operation is achieved through the use of the 'assign' keyword in RTL design with Verilog. The operation will be continuously monitored and reflects the latest change in the right-hand expressions. Note that the value '1'b0' is a single-bit binary literal, with '1'b' indicating that it's one bit long, and '0' being the value of that bit.
