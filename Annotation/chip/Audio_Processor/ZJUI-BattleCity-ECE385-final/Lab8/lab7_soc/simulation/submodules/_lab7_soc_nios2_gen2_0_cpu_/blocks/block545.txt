This block is a monitoring module that triggers specific actions based on certain conditions in a clocked process. It's sensitive to both the positive edge of the clock and the negative edge of the 'jrst_n' signal. When a reset signal is detected ('jrst_n' is 0), it sets all monitoring flags ('monitor_ready', 'monitor_error', 'monitor_go') to zero. In other circumstances ('jrst_n' is 1), it checks for the occurrence of various conditions ('take_action_ocimem_a' & 'jdo[25]', 'take_action_ocireg' & 'ocireg_mrs', etc.) and sets the monitoring flags accordingly. Independence of handling for each monitor flag ensures selective enabling/disabling. This design creates a versatile control mechanism for the overall system based on multiple condition checks and resets.
