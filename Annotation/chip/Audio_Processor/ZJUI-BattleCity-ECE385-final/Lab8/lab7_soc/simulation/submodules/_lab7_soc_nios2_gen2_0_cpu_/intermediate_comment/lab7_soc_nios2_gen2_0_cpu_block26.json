    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of `D_ctrl_b_is_dst` to `R_ctrl_b_is_dst_nxt` in the next clock cycle. The `assign` keyword in Verilog indicates that the right-hand expression's value (`D_ctrl_b_is_dst`) is continuously driven to the left-hand identifier (`R_ctrl_b_is_dst_nxt`). Therefore, whenever there's a change in the `D_ctrl_b_is_dst`, it gets propagated to `R_ctrl_b_is_dst_nxt` immediately. The action does not depend on a clock signal or any conditional statement, manifesting an essential characteristic of combinational logic."
