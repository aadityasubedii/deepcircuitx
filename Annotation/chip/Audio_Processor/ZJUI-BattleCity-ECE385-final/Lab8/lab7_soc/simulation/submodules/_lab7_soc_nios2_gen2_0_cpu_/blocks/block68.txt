Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for defining a continuous assignment in the hardware design which determines the subsequent value of `R_ctrl_alu_subtract`. This value is obtained directly from `D_ctrl_alu_subtract`. This operation is performed continuously and updates `R_ctrl_alu_subtract` whenever `D_ctrl_alu_subtract` changes. This block forms a vital part of the data path in the design, ensuring the value transfer between these two signals.
