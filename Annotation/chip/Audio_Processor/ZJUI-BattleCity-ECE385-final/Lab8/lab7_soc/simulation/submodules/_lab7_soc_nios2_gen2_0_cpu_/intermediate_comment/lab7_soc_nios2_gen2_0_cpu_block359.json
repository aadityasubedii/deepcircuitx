The FIFO is enabled when either of the following three conditions are met: the write pointer is currently pointing to the 7th FIFO and there's at least one input ready; the second input ready signal is active, the increment-by-one write pointer is pointing to the 7th FIFO and there is available space in higher FIFO buffers; or the third input ready signal is active, the increment-by-two write pointer is pointing to the 7th FIFO and there is available space in higher FIFO buffers."
