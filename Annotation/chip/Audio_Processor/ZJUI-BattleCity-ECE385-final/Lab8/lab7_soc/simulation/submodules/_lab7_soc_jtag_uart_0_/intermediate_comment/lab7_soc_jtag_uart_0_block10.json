    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the pause interrupt flag, `pause_irq`, in a synchronous system. When there's a negative edge on the reset line `rst_n`, the `pause_irq` flag is cleared. If the system isn't in reset, the `pause_irq` flag is set if pause (`t_pause`) is true and the FIFO buffer isn't empty (`~fifo_EF`). However, if a `read_0` event occurs, the `pause_irq` flag is cleared irrespective of other conditions."
