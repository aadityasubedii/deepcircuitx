    "block_comment": "This block performs sign extension for 2's complement numbers in E_src2 and determines the second operand for the arithmetic operation. It makes use of a bitwise XOR operation between the most significant bit and a control signal E_invert_arith_src_msb to achieve MSB reflection, and concatenates the result with the rest 30 bits of E_src2; the operation effectively extends the sign of a negative number in E_src2 for operations requiring more than the existing 32 bits."
