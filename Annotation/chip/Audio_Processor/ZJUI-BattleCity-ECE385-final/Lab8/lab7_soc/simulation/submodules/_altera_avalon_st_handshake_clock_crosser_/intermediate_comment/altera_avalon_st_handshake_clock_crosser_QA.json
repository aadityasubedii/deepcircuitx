It caters to a variety of inputs and outputs with tell-tales and signals for packet start and end, channels, errors in signals, among several others. It further contains a separate altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser instance within it, which plays the role of the interface's central communication handling component. Both incoming and outgoing data flow processings, including whether or not to use packets, channels, errors, and the related empty field dimensions are managed in the structure. Multiple functions are generated depending on the requirements of the use-cases, such as packets conveying start and end of transmission, inclusion of channel information, and error notifications. It also contains a function for getting the ceiling value of log base 2 of an integer, applicable to bit manipulation purposes."

Control signals include clock and reset signals (which are essential for synchronizing operations within digital systems), ready and valid signals (which are necessary for flow control in the same), and startofpacket and endofpacket signals (which are critical for delineating distinct packets of data in stream-based communication interfaces). The actual data signals are carried by the 'in_data' and 'out_data' ports, while error indications (if any) and channel related information are carried by respective ports. In essence, each of these ports plays a distinct role in ensuring that data can flow in and out of this module with the right ordering, and with proper synchronization and error-checking, thus ensuring the module can play its part within the larger digital system it belongs to."
