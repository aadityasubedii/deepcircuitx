Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for assigning the `xbrk1_armed` signal based on the status of `trigger_state_0` and `trigger_state_1`. The `xbrk1_armed` gets a true state when `xbrk_ctrl1[4]` is high and `trigger_state_0` is true or when `xbrk_ctrl1[5]` is high and `trigger_state_1` is true. This can be utilized in subsequent logic where a certain condition needs to be met based on the values of `trigger_state_0` and `trigger_state_1`.
