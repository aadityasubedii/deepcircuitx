    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for system safety and data validation by detecting error during data writing process in a synchronous digital system setting. On each rising edge of the clock signal or falling edge of the reset signal, it checks if the `reset_n` signal is equal to 0. If not, it subsequently checks if both `W_valid` and `R_wr_dst_reg` signals are high. If they are, a bitwise XOR operation is performed on `W_wr_data` to check if it's undefined ('x'). If so, it writes an error message indicating the occurrence of the undefined state and stops the operation, safeguarding against potential unpredictable behaviours."
