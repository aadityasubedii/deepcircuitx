    "block_comment": "This block assigns the next state of the break control signal (`R_ctrl_break_nxt`) in a control FSM. The value of `R_ctrl_break_nxt` is assigned to be equal to the present state of the break control signal (`D_ctrl_break`). This is a simple assignment operation performed within a clocked sequential logic block. The effect of this line of code will only be visible after a clock edge where the new assigned state (`R_ctrl_break_nxt`) will be equal to current state before the clock edge (`D_ctrl_break`).\n"
