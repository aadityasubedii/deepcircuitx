This block of code displays a simulation mode initiation message on the console. The task is accomplished using an 'initial' block that executes the '$display' system task in Verilog which outputs a specified string to the standard output. The '%m' construct signifies to print the full hierarchical name of the scope of the calling task/function. In this case, it will print the message "Info: Metastable event injection simulation mode enabled" at the start of the simulation.
