Comment: 
This Verilog RTL block is a D-type flip-flop with asynchronous reset that is used to load and control values within a register. The execution is triggered by a positive edge clock signal or a negative edge reset signal. When the reset signal is active low, it sets the 'R_ctrl_ld_ex' control to zero state thus clearing the register. However, if the enable signal 'R_en' is high during a clock's positive edge, the next state of 'R_ctrl_ld_ex' is set to the value of 'R_ctrl_ld_ex_nxt', which could used for updating the value at the next clock cycle.
