    "block_comment": "The block assigns a boolean value to `xbrk_ton_hit` based on whether any of the four signals `xbrk0_ton_hit`, `xbrk1_ton_hit`, `xbrk2_ton_hit`, or `xbrk3_ton_hit` is true. It does this using a bitwise OR operation, which results in `xbrk_ton_hit` being true if any one (or more) of the inputs is true, and false only if all inputs are false."
