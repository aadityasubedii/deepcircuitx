    "block_comment": "The block of code represents an assignment operation in Verilog. The functionality of this line is to copy or assign the current value of `D_ctrl_br_cmp` to `R_ctrl_br_cmp_nxt` in the next state of the hardware. This is accomplished through the usage of `assign` keyword, which is a continuous assignment statement in Verilog used to assign values to the wire data types. It assigns the right-hand side expression or connection to the left-hand side wire immediately or continuously as soon as the right side changes."
