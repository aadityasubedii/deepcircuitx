Module name: lab7_soc_otg_hpi_address.

Module specification: The lab7_soc_otg_hpi_address module is designed as a hardware-interface to control the address lines of an on-the-go (OTG) system on a chip (SoC). The module receives several inputs including a 2-bit address, chipselect, a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (reset_n), write enable signal (write_n) and a 32-bit write data (writedata). The main functionality of this module is to assign the first two bits of write data to an internal register (data_out) when the chip is selected, writing is enabled, and the address is zero. When reset signal is active, the data_out is cleared to zero. The module provides two output signals - "out_port" and "readdata". 'out_port' provides the value of data_out while 'readdata' provides a 32-bit output where the low 2 bits are the value of data_out and the remaining 30 bits are zeros.

Internally, the module utilises several signals. 'clk_en' is a wire internally set to 1 but does not have any specific role in this module. 'data_out' is a 2-bit register that temporarily stores the write data under specified conditions. 'out_port' - an output port, is wired directly to 'data_out'. The 'read_mux_out' wire selects the data_out content when the address is zero and outputs zero otherwise. The 'readdata' wire forms a 32-bit read output, extending 'read_mux_out' with 30 leading zeros.

The code splits into several blocks: the declaration part that specifies the input/output ports and internal signals; the assignments of 'clk_en', 'read_mux_out', 'readdata', 'out_port'; and the always block controlling how 'data_out' behaves by different signals. These combined sections work concurrently to store write data and generate the module's read output.
