    "block_comment": "This block of code is assigning a constant value to a signal. The signal named `dct_is_taken` is set to a binary value of '0'. Essentially, this operation is forcing `dct_is_taken` to be low or '0' all the time. This is done directly without any conditioning logic around it, making `dct_is_taken` a constant signal that can be used as a control flag or baseline throughout the code base."
