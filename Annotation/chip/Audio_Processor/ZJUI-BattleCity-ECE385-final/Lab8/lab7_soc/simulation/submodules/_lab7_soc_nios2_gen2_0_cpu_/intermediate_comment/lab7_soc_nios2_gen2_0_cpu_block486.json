    "block_comment": "The purpose of this block is to carry out a logical operation, it checks for a hit event in any of the 'xbrk_toff' registers. This is done through the utilization of the bitwise OR operation. It assigns the outcome of the operation to 'xbrk_toff_hit'. If any of the 'xbrk_toff_hit' registers (from 0 to 3) yields true (1), 'xbrk_toff_hit' will similarly output true, indicating that a hit event has taken place. This line is generally used within the context of a larger module and provides an assertion role in detecting an event occurrence."
