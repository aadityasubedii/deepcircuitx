    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a guide for the user of this RTL design, providing instructions on how to properly simulate accesses to SDRAM. It achieves this task by using the `$write` function - a system task in Verilog used for sending formatted data to an output stream - to print out a series of messages with directives. These messages instruct the user to download and install a vendor-provided simulation model, include it in the top level system file, and instantiate and wire up SDRAM simulation models in the testbench. The messages also make the user aware of possible modifications in vendor models to accommodate zero-delay based simulations."
