Comment: 
This block of code represents a synchronous circuit that responds to the positive edge of a clock signal or the negative edge of a reset signal. Upon reset (when reset_n is 0), the 'wait_for_one_post_bret_inst' is cleared to 0. If reset doesn't occur (reset_n is not 0), the block decides whether or not to wait for one instruction after a breakpoint, depending on the values of 'hbreak_enabled', 'oci_single_step_mode' and 'F_valid'. If hardware break is not enabled and single step mode is on, the block prepares to wait; otherwise, if 'F_valid' is high or single-step mode is off, the block abstains from waiting. The previous state of 'wait_for_one_post_bret_inst' is maintained if neither of these conditions meets.
