    "block_comment": "This block controls the status of 'E_xbrk_traceon' with respect to system clock (clk) and reset signal (reset_n) conditions. When a negative reset signal is detected (indicating a reset operation), 'E_xbrk_traceon' is set to zero, effectively disabling x-break tracing. In case the reset signal isn't active and 'E_cpu_addr_en' is TRUE, meaning a CPU address is enabled, then 'E_xbrk_traceon' is set to the value of 'xbrk_ton_hit'. In essence, the block enables or disables x-break tracing depending on CPU address activation and system reset operations.\n"
