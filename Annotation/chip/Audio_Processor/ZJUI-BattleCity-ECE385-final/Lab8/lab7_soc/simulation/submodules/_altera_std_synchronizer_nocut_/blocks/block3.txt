This block implements a register with synchronous reset functionality. When the 'reset_n' signal is active low, the register 'dreg' is asynchronously set to a bit-vector of ones with length 'depth'. During the positive edge of the clock 'clk', if the 'reset_n' signal is not active, the input 'din_s1' is loaded into the register 'dreg'.
