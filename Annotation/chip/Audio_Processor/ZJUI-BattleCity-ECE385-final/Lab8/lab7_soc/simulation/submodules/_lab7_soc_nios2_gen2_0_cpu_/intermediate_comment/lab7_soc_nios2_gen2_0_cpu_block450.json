    "block_comment": "This block is a simple assignment operation in Verilog RTL code. It sets the output signal, `dbrk1_trigout`, to low ('0'). This is a non-blocking assignment, which means that it will not block the execution of subsequent lines of code in the same block. It is done to initialize or reset the `dbrk1_trigout` signal to a known state (low) for subsequent operations."
