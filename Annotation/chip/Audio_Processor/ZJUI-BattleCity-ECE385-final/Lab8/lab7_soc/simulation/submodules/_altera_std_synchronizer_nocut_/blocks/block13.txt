This block of code is typically utilized to create a conditional block in synthesis based on the value of 'rst_value'. Specifically, this 'generate if' block is conditionally instantiated if 'rst_value' equals zero. This procedure lends flexibility in defining if certain parts of RTL need to be synthesized based on different design configurations. However, the value of 'rst_value' must be a compile-time constant to allow for design elaboration. Such a block aids in tailoring the hardware design according to the specifics of the design requirements, such as optional features or target performance metrics.
