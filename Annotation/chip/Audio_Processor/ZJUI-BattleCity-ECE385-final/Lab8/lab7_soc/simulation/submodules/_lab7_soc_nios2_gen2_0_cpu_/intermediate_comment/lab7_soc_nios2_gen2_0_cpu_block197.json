    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value to the signal `av_ld_done` which indicates completion of a load operation. The assignment is done via a bitwise operation, specifically an AND operation on the inverted signal `av_ld_waiting_for_data_nxt` and the OR operation of `D_ctrl_mem32` and the negated signal `av_ld_aligning_data_nxt`. This implies that `av_ld_done` will be set to TRUE when there's no wait state for the next data and either `D_ctrl_mem32` is TRUE or there's no alignment operation for the next data."
