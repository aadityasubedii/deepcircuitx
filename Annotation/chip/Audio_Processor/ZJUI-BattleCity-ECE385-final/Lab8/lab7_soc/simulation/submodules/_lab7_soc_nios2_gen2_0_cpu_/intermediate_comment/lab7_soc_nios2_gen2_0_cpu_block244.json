    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for assigning a value to the 16 most significant bits (MSB) of the source 2 register `R_src2_hi` based on the condition of three boolean control signals. If the control signal `R_ctrl_force_src2_zero` or `R_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16` is true, then the MSB of source 2 register is filled with the MSB bit of `R_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm`. If not, all the bits are filled with the source `D_iw_imm16[15]`, which is either the immediate value from the instruction word `D_iw_imm16` when `R_ctrl_hi_imm16` is true or the upper 16 bits of the B port of the register file `R_rf_b[31 : 16]` when `R_src2_use_imm` is true."
