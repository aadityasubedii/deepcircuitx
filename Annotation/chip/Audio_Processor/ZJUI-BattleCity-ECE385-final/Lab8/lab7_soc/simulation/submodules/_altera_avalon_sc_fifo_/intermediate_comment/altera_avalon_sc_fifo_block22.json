    "block_comment": "The block is a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer management system that monitors and regulates the fill level of the FIFO buffer. The fill level is adjusted on every clock cycle based on the reset, read or write operations. On a reset signal, it clears the fill level count. If there's an error, it subtracts the current packet length from the fill level. If write operations are performed, the fill level is incremented, and for a read operation, the fill level is decremented. All these checks and operations ensure that the buffer maintains optimal fill level. The 'fifo_fill_level' variable tracks buffer usage updates based on various conditions."
