Comment: 
The code block defines a multiplexer which selects an input based on different conditions and assigns it to `fifo_15_mux`. Fifo write pointer (`fifo_wrptr`), itm, atm, dtm validation signals and a signal indicating if two or more fifo entries are free (`ge2_free`) are used to determine the selection. If the write pointer is at location 15 and itm, atm or dtm are valid, itm data, overflow pending atm or overflow pending dtm data will be selected respectively. If the write pointer is at location 14 (implied by `fifo_wrptr_plus1 == 4'd15`) and whether two more fifo spots are free and itm, atm or dtm are valid, overflow pending atm or overflow pending dtm data will be selected based on the condition. If all conditions are false, overflow pending dtm data will be selected.
