    "block_comment": "The block assigns the logical OR of multiple variables to the `D_ctrl_br_cmp` flag. These variables indicate different comparison operations, and their logical OR forms a decision set. If any of these operations are present, `D_ctrl_br_cmp` is set to HIGH (True) indicating that there exists a specific branch comparison operation in the data stream. The implementation uses a combinatorial logic approach by assigning the logical OR of several comparison operation flags to the `D_ctrl_br_cmp`. This compact logical gate implementation enables quick and efficient decision making for processing data paths."
