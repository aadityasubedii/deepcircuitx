    "block_comment": "This block implements a multi-way multiplexer that determines the value to be assigned to the `fifo_10_mux` signal based on a group of conditions. The block evaluates sequential boolean conditions and, for the first truthy condition met, the corresponding expression's output is assigned. If the `fifo_wrptr` is `4'd10` and `itm_valid` is true, `itm` is selected. In other cases involving the write pointer at a position, valid flags, and overflow flags, accordingly `overflow_pending_atm` or `overflow_pending_dtm` is chosen. If none of the conditions is fulfilled, it defaults to `overflow_pending_dtm`."
