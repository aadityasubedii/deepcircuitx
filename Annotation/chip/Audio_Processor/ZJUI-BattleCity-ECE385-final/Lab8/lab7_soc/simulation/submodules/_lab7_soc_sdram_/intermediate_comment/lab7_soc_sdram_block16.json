    "block_comment": "This block is a counter reset and decrement system used in refresh operations. On a negative edge of reset_n signal or a positive edge of the clock signal, it checks a few conditions. If reset_n is 0, it sets the `refresh_counter` to 10000, implementing a reset operation of the counter. Alternatively, if the `refresh_counter` becomes 0, it resets it back to the value 390. In all other cases, it simply decrements the `refresh_counter` by 1 at every tick of the clock. This control mechanism helps to maintain system refresh in sync with the clock pulses and provides an automatic reset function."
