Comment: 
This block manages the validity of data output from a buffer in a synchronous system, specifically under data read, error, or reset conditions. On every positive clock edge, the block sets the 'internal_out_valid' register to low if a reset signal is received. Meanwhile, if no reset signal is present, 'internal_out_valid' is a logic operation based on three conditions - a non-empty buffer, the readiness to forward data, and absence of error. Additionally, if a 'read' takes place, 'internal_out_valid' is further modified when the incremented read pointer equals the write pointer, signifying the buffer is empty.
