This block is a simple continuous assignment statement in Verilog, assigning the value of 'D_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br' to the wire 'R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br_nxt'. This non-blocking assignment ensures that 'R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br_nxt' instantly assumes the value of 'D_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br' whenever the latter changes. This is basic wire assignment, often used to update values or pass signals through hierarchy in RTL design.
