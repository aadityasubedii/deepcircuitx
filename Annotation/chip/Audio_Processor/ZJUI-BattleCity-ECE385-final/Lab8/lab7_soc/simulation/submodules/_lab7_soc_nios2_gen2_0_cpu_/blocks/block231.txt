The block assigns the lower 29 bits of the arithmetic result, `E_arith_result`, to the `E_mem_baddr` address register. This operation is conducted using the Verilog `assign` construct, which establishes a continuous assignment relationship between operands where changes in the right-hand side (`E_arith_result[28 : 0]`) are continually driven to the left-hand side (`E_mem_baddr`).
