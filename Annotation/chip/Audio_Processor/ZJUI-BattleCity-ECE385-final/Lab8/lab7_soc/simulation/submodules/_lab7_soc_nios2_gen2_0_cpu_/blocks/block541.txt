[388, 388]
Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is responsible for assigning the high order bits from the 'break_a_wpr' signal to the signal 'break_a_wpr_high_bits'. The selection of these specific bits is accomplished using a bit-wise slicing operation, where the 'break_a_wpr' signal is sliced from the 3rd bit to the 2nd bit inclusive (assuming a 0-based index).
