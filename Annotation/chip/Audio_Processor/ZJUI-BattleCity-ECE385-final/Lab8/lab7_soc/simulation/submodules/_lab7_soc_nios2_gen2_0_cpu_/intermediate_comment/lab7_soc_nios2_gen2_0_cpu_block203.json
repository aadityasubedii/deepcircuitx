    "block_comment": "The block of code is serving as a data storage or assignment unit with a system reset function in a synchronous digital system. When the system clock (clk) ticks or there's a low logic (negative edge) on the system reset (reset_n), the logic in this block will be executed. If the reset_n signal is at logic low, the d_writedata is immediately reset to zero, providing a system-level safeguard to clear previously stored data. Conversely, if the reset_n signal is not at logic low, that implies normal system conditions under which d_writedata is set to the value of E_st_data."
