This block defines a flip-flop that updates on the rising edge of clock (clk) signal or falling edge of reset_n signal. If the reset signal is active-low, the 'R_ctrl_alu_force_and' output gets force-reset to 0. Otherwise, if the 'R_en' signal is high, the output value of 'R_ctrl_alu_force_and' in the next clock cycle will be the same as the current value of 'R_ctrl_alu_force_and_nxt'.
