    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` module provides a data transfer mechanism between different clock domains. It leverages Altera's standard synchronization and pipeline processing for data transportation, using input signals like `in_clk`, `in_reset`, `in_ready`, and `in_valid` to control the flow of data. Internal signals like `in_data_buffer`, `out_data_buffer`, `in_data_toggle`, and `out_data_toggle` manage data buffering and ordering. The functionality is achieved through parameter declarations, signal handling, and conditional execution affecting the pipeline stage."
