    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a signal for taking specific action on a memory module under certain conditions. The \"take_action_ocimem_b\" signal is activated when the \"enable_action_strobe\" signal is true, the instruction register \"ir\" contains '00', and the 36th bit of \"jdo\" is high. This combined logic condition is implemented using bitwise operators and comparators."
