    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a sequential logic that determines the validity of an output register (R_valid). Implemented as an always block, it is triggered by the positive edge of the clock (clk) or the negative edge of the asynchronous reset signal (reset_n). When encountering a negative reset state, the 'R_valid' register is reset to zero, indicating that the output register is not valid. Otherwise, in normal operation (when the reset is not asserted), the validity of 'R_valid' is directly tied to the validity of 'D_valid'."
