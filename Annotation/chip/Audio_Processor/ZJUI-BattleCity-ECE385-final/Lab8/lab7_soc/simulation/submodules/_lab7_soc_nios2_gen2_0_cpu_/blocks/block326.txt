Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a synchronous reset logic. It reacts either to the rising edge of the clock, 'clk', or the falling edge of the reset line, 'jrst_n'. The section first checks if 'jrst_n' equals to zero, implying a reset event. On a reset, both signal-lines 'trc_im_addr' and 'trc_wrap' are set to zero to initialize the system. Instead, if the reset event is not the case, i.e., normal clock operation, the signals are also reset to zero. The common action suggests that this block continually resets these two lines during normal operation and on a reset event as well.
