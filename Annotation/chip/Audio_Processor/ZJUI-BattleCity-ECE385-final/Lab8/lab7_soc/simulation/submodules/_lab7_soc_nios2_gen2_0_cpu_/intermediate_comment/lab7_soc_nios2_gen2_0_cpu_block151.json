    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a new value for `W_bstatus_reg_nxt`. This assignment is conditional on whether `E_valid` is true. If `E_valid` is true, the next value for `W_bstatus_reg_nxt` is assigned as `W_bstatus_reg_inst_nxt`. If `E_valid` is false, the current value of `W_bstatus_reg` is retained. The ternary operator in Verilog (`? :`) is used to achieve this conditional functionality."
