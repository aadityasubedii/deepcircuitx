    "block_comment": "This block of the Verilog code is responsible for performing a bitwise OR operation on the output of the read multiplexer with a 32-bit zero vector (Function of the block). The expression within the curly brace {} forms a 32-bit vector, then an assign statement performs a bitwise OR operation to merge the 32-bit zero vector with the 'read_mux_out' output of the read multiplexer. It then assigns the result to 'readdata'. This effectively zero-extends 'read_mux_out' to 32 bits if it wasn't already and passes the extended value to 'readdata' (Implementation details of the block)."
