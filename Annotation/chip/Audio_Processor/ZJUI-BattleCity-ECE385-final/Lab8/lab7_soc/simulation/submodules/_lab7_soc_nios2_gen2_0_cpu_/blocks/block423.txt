The block of code is assigning a constant value to signal `is_idct`. Specifically, it sets the value to `1'b0` which corresponds to a binary number of one bit length with the value of 0. This is a simple declaration and initialization of a signal in Verilog. The aim is to set up `is_idct` as a constant low value (0) signal for use elsewhere in the overall code. The block achieves its function by using the `assign` keyword which is essentially used for continuous assignments in Verilog.
