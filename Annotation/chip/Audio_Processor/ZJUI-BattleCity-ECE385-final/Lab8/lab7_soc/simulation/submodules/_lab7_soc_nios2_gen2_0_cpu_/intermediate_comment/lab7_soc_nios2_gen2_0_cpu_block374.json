    "block_comment": "The block enables a FIFO when certain conditions are met. The `fifo_2_enable` will be activated when the FIFO write pointer (`fifo_wrptr`) is set to 2 and there is at least one input (`input_ge1`). Alternatively, the FIFO can also be enabled when the second and third conditions are satisfied: if there are more than 2 free elements (`ge2_free`) and the increased FIFO write pointer (`fifo_wrptr_plus1`) is set to 2 with at least two inputs (`input_ge2`) or if there are more than three free elements (`ge3_free`) and the increased FIFO write pointer (`fifo_wrptr_plus2`) is set to 2 with at least three inputs (`input_ge3`)."
