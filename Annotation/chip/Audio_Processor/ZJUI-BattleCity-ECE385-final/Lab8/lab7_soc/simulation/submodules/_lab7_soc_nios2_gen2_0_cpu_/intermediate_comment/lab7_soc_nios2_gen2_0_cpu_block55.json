    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a synchronous reset pattern in a Verilog RTL code design. Whenever a positive clock edge or a negative edge of 'reset_n' is detected, the logic inside the 'always' block is evaluated. When 'reset_n' equals zero, which indicates an active-low reset, the register 'R_ctrl_ld' is cleared to 0. On a positive clock edge, if 'R_en' is high, the value of 'R_ctrl_ld' is updated with the value from 'R_ctrl_ld_nxt'."
