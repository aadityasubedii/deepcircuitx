    "block_comment": "This block of code allows data read and output process in a hardware system. The first line generates a 32-bit read data, by bitwise OR operation with 'read_mux_out', providing a mechanism to read data from other resources within the system. The second line, assigns the 'data_out' to the 'out_port', thereby enabling the system to output the data. This simplistic logic ensures easy data flow control utilizing bitwise operation and direct assignment."
