    "block_comment": "This block of code is concerned with the dynamic assignment of the input payload according to certain parameters (packet use, error width, and channel width). It takes several input signals and repackages them according to whether packets are being used, and the widths of the error and channel. If packets are being used, the input signals are grouped into a payload that includes errors and channel data if their widths are non-zero. If packets are not being used, some signals are simply assigned as zero and others are grouped into a simplified payload. The output payload is subsequently disassembled into individual signals. This dynamic packaging and unpackaging of data is implemented via conditional statements (if-else) within generate-endgenerate construct, allowing the flexibility in hardware generation based on the parameters set."
