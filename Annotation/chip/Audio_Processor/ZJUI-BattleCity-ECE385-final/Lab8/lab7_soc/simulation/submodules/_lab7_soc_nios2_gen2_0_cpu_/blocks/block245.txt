Comment: 
The block is responsible for assigning the lower 16 bits of the second register source operand, `R_src2_lo`. Conditionally, if either `R_ctrl_force_src2_zero` or `R_ctrl_hi_imm16` flags are high, it forces all 16 bits of `R_src2_lo` to the remainder of `D_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm`. Alternatively, when `R_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot` is high, a concatenation of eleven 0's and 5-bit immediate value `D_iw_imm5` is assigned to `R_src2_lo`. If `R_src2_use_imm` is high, use 16-bit immediate value `D_iw_imm16`. Otherwise, take lower 16 bits from register file `R_rf_b`.
