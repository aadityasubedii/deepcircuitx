    "block_comment": "This block of code declares a wire ('xbrk1_value') and assigns it a 32-bit binary value of 0. The assign statement in Verilog functions for continuous assignment, meaning the wire 'xbrk1_value' will always hold the specified value unless it's reassigned later in the code. The allocated 32 bits assure that the wire can handle a wide range of values, but here it's initialized to zero."
