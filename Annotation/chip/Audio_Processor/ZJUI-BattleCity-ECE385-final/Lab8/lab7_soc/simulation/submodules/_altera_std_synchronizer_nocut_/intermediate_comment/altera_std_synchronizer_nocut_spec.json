    "spec": "Module name: altera_std_synchronizer_nocut. \nModule specification: This module is primarily designed to synchronize signals crossing different clock domains, thereby decreasing the chance of metastability issues. It consists of a multi-stage synchronizer that can handle variable reset logic with active high or low based on the parameter \"rst_value\". If the depth parameter is less than 2, an error is reported. \n\nThe module comprises of three input ports: 'clk' (the clock input for the module's synchronous components), 'reset_n' (an active-low reset input causing the module to go into its initial state), and 'din' (the input data signal that needs synchronization between different clock domains). It has one output port 'dout' (the synchronized data output signal which passes data from 'din' through a network of registers, helping to safely transmit 'din' across clock domains while mitigating metastability issues). \n\nInternal signals include 'din_s1' (a register for initial capture of 'din'), 'dreg' (a series of registers for multiple resampling of the signal), and special signals like 'RANDOM_SEED', 'next_din_s1', 'din_last', 'random', 'metastable_event' which simulate a metastable condition for test purposes. Furthermore, 'dout' is an internal signal that transmits the final output from the 'dreg' to outside of the module. \n\nThe program initiates by checking the depth of the synchronizer and then diverges into two main blocks based on the \"__ALTERA_STD__METASTABLE_SIM\" directive's definition. If it's defined, the design simulates metastable conditions for testing purposes using special signals and generating random events. If not defined, normal synchronization operations are performed with the 'din' signal being processed through 'din_s1' and 'dreg' based on the reset logic and then passed to 'dout' as output. Moreover, the depth of synchronization affects how 'dreg' is driven and the assignment of the final 'dout' signal, ensuring metastability risk mitigation in the inter-domain signal pass.",

Internal signals: din_s1, dreg, RANDOM_SEED, next_din_s1, din_last, random, metastable_event. \n\nExplanation: \n\n- din_s1: it's a register where the input data 'din' is initially stored. This is the first stage of the synchronizer. The input data 'din' is sampled and held in this signal at every rising edge of the clock. \n\n- dreg: it's a multi-bit signal and acts as a series of registers (based on the parameter \"depth\"). At every clock edge, the data passes from 'din_s1' to this signal serially from the LSB to MSB. This series of registers are used to mitigate the risks of metastability by resampling the signal multiple times. \n\n- RANDOM_SEED, next_din_s1, din_last, random, metastable_event: These signals are used when the metastability simulation mode is enabled via the \"__ALTERA_STD__METASTABLE_SIM\" define directive. 'RANDOM_SEED' is used to seed the pseudo-random generation for metastability simulation. 'next_din_s1' is the next value of 'din_s1', 'din_last' holds the last value of 'din', 'random' holds the random number and 'metastable_event' is an event trigger used for metastability event simulation.

This is the final output of the synchronizer which represents the input data 'din' which has been safely passed and synchronized from the input clock domain to the output clock domain."

                    "text": "Module name: altera_std_synchronizer_nocut. \nModule specification: This module is primarily designed to synchronize signals crossing different clock domains, thereby decreasing the chance of metastability issues. It consists of a multi-stage synchronizer that can handle variable reset logic with active high or low based on the parameter \"rst_value\". If the depth parameter is less than 2, an error is reported. \n\nThe module comprises of three input ports: 'clk' (the clock input for the module's synchronous components), 'reset_n' (an active-low reset input causing the module to go into its initial state), and 'din' (the input data signal that needs synchronization between different clock domains). It has one output port 'dout' (the synchronized data output signal which passes data from 'din' through a network of registers, helping to safely transmit 'din' across clock domains while mitigating metastability issues). \n\nInternal signals include 'din_s1' (a register for initial capture of 'din'), 'dreg' (a series of registers for multiple resampling of the signal), and special signals like 'RANDOM_SEED', 'next_din_s1', 'din_last', 'random', 'metastable_event' which simulate a metastable condition for test purposes. Furthermore, 'dout' is an internal signal that transmits the final output from the 'dreg' to outside of the module. \n\nThe program initiates by checking the depth of the synchronizer and then diverges into two main blocks based on the \"__ALTERA_STD__METASTABLE_SIM\" directive's definition. If it's defined, the design simulates metastable conditions for testing purposes using special signals and generating random events. If not defined, normal synchronization operations are performed with the 'din' signal being processed through 'din_s1' and 'dreg' based on the reset logic and then passed to 'dout' as output. Moreover, the depth of synchronization affects how 'dreg' is driven and the assignment of the final 'dout' signal, ensuring metastability risk mitigation in the inter-domain signal pass."
