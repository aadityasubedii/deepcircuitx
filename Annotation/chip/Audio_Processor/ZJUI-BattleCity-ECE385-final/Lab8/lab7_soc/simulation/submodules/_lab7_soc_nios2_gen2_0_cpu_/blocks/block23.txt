Comment: 
The given line of code is a non-blocking assignment in Verilog, typically used in sequential logic such as flip-flops. This RTL code assigns the value of 'D_ctrl_ignore_dst' to 'R_ctrl_ignore_dst_nxt' in the next clock cycle. The assignment happens in a non-blocking manner which means that it doesn't prevent further execution until the current execution is completed. This feature is essential in synchronous designs where numerous tasks can be run simultaneously. In this case, the signal 'R_ctrl_ignore_dst_nxt' is bestowed the value of 'D_ctrl_ignore_dst' in the subsequent clock pulse.
