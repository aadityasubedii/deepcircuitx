Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is used for extracting the sign bit of the arithmetic result. Here, the "assign" statement is used to continuously drive the E_lt signal with the value of the 33rd bit (index 32) of the E_arith_result. This particular bit generally indicates the sign of the computed arithmetic value - a '1' signifies a negative value and a '0' signifies a positive value. So, essentially, this block is used for sign detection of the E_arith_result.
