Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages the assignment of statuses based on address line actions, mainly controlling operations related to an active memory bank. It assigns `active_bank` using portions of `active_addr`. Further, it matches the current chip select (`csn_match`), read-write (`rnw_match`), active bank (`bank_match`), and row of address (`row_match`) with their counterpart factors. The `pending` status indicates whether all match conditions hold true and that the memory slot is not empty. Finally, it assigns `cas_addr` based on whether `f_select` is high or low, and takes either part of `f_addr` or `active_addr` as input.
