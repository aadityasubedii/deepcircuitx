It uses a non-blocking assignment to map the future value of signal `R_ctrl_ld_ex_nxt` to the present value of `D_ctrl_ld_ex`. The non-blocking assignment is used here to ensure that updates occur sequentially instead of simultaneously, maintaining the orderliness within the synchronous digital system."
