The block of code is a conditional statement monitoring the D_valid signal under a clock edge. When the system is not in a reset state (reset_n is high) and D_valid is unknown ('x'), the code generates an error message and halts the system. This is done by using a system task $write to output the time of the error and associated error message, then $stop to terminate the simulation.
