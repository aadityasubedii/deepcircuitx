    "block_comment": "The block serves as a simple memory unit that resets or updates the 'data_out' signal. Upon detection of the rising edge of the 'clk' clock signal or the falling edge of 'reset_n', the block executes. In the situation of a reset (when 'reset_n' is 0), 'data_out' is reassigned the value 0. Alternatively, when the chip is selected ('chipselect' is true), a write operation is not in progress ('write_n' is false) and the 'address' equals 0, 'data_out' gets updated with the lower two bits of 'writedata'."
