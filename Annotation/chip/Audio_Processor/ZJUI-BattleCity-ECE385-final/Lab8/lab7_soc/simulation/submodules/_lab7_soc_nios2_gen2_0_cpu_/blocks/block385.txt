This line of code is basically performing an arithmetic operation in a FIFO buffer management. Specifically, it adds 2 to the current write pointer `fifo_wrptr` of the FIFO buffer and assigns the result back to the new variable `fifo_wrptr_plus2`. This operation likely facilitates the buffer write operations by preparing for the next addressing space.
