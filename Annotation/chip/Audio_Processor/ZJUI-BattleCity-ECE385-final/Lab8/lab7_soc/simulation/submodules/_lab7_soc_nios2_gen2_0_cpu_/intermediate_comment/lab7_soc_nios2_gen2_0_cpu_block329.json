    "block_comment": "This block assigns the outcome of the module's overflow condition to the overflow_pending_atm signal. It achieves this by concatenating the overflow_pending and atm[34:0] signals. The [34:0] notation indicates that the block is using the entire 35-bit atm word, from bit 0 to bit 34. The overflow_pending signal represents the pending overflow condition, and atm[34:0] holds the current state of the ATM word. The overflow and ATM status are tied together to indicate the overall system status."
