This block of code assigns the next return address control signal from the current cycle to the next cycle. It's essentially a wire assignment operator where the value of 'D_ctrl_retaddr' is assigned to the 'R_ctrl_retaddr_nxt'. Specifically, the 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used to specify a continuous assignment and is typically used with wire data types. Here, it's used to propagate the return address signal from decode stage to the next stage in the pipeline.
