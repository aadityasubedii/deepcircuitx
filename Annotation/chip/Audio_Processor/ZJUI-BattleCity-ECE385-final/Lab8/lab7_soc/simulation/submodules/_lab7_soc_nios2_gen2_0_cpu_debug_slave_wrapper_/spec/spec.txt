Module name: lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_debug_slave_wrapper.

Module specification: This Verilog RTL module serves as a wrapper for a debug slave module of a System on Chip (SoC), specifically a Nios II Gen 2 CPU, in a laboratory project. Its functionality includes the establishment of a debug interface to monitor and control various operational parameters of the system. It integrates input data from different logic parts, processes it, and outputs the data for further actions like managing trace memory and handling breakpoints.

The module has 19 input ports and 13 output ports. Inputs include MonDReg and break_readreg (32-bit input data registers), clk (system clock), a series of dbrk_hitX_latch inputs (debug breakpoint status), debugack (debug acknowledgement), monitor_ready, monitor_error (monitor status indicators), reset_n, resetlatch (reset signals), tracemem_on, tracemem_trcdata (36-bit data) and tracemem_tw (trace memory indicators), trc_im_addr (7-bit trace image address), trc_on, trc_wrap (trace information), trigbrktype, and trigger_state_1 (trigger information). Output ports include a 38-bit jdo (debugging interface data for JTAG port), jrst_n (JTAG reset), st_ready_test_idle (system test idle status), series of take_action_break_X signals (indicating break control actions), take_action_ocimem_X (indicating ocimem control actions), take_action_tracectrl (trace control action), and the inverses take_no_action_break_X and take_no_action_ocimem_a.

The internal signals include a 38-bit sr (shift register), vji_cdr, vji_sdr, vji_udr (data register signals), vji_ir_in, vji_ir_out (instruction register signals), vji_rti (real-time interrupt), vji_tck (test clock input), vji_tdi, vji_tdo (test data), and vji_uir (update instruction register).

The code consists of two main blocks. One makes use of the lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_debug_slave_tck and the other uses the lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_debug_slave_sysclk. The first block controls the temporal aspect of the system by managing the test clock (TCK) and debug-related interactions, while the second block manages the system clock and interactions with the operational control instructions memory (ocimem) and breakpoints. Other parts of the code include the definition of inputs, outputs, and internal signals, and assign statements for several signals.
