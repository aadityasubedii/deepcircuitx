    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the status of an internal signal, 'internal_out_valid'. The signal is set to the result of the logical AND operation between the negation of the 'empty' signal and the 'ok_to_forward' signal, meaning 'internal_out_valid' becomes true when the buffer isn't empty and it's okay to forward data."
