    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is used for assigning a particular value to the signal `CODE`. It implements a bitwise AND operation on the signal `cmd_all` and the hexadecimal number `4'h7` and checks the result. If the result is true, the hexadecimal value `24'h494e48` is assigned to `CODE`; otherwise, the value of `txt_code` is assigned to `CODE`."
