Module-level comment: The 'lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0' module is a top-level wrapper for a Nios II Gen 2 soft-core processor predominantly designed for system-on-chip (SoC) patterns on Altera/Intel FPGAs. It interfaces system-level interactions with the CPU, managing data and instruction buses, read and write signals, interrupts, and debug functionalities. The module directly translates system-level signals to the CPU-level and vice versa without any internal signals. Notably characterized by inputs handling data and instructions read, wait requests, interrupt requests, and debug memory operations, along with outputs controlling data and instruction operations, debug requests, and debug reads, ensuring a robust Harvard Architecture design.
