    "spec": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser. \n\nModule specification: The `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` is a clock crossing buffer module operating to synchronize data transfer between two different clock domains. It utilizes Altera's standard synchronization module and pipeline processing with adjustable synchronization depth and modifiable data width. \nThere are several input ports in this module. These include the `in_clk` and `in_reset` signals which manage the timing and initialization. The `in_ready` and `in_valid` signals control the flow of input data, and `in_data` represents the actual multi-bit input data. An additional input port, `out_ready`, signifies whether the output module is prepared to accept new incoming data. \n\nIn terms of output ports, `out_ready` indicates that data on the module's end has been processed and is anticipating to be exported. The `out_valid` levels up to denote the point at which it's valid to read the output data, and `out_data` is the actual processed data that will be sent out from the system. \n\nInternally, the module dwells on multiple signals like `in_data_buffer` and `out_data_buffer` for the buffering of input and output data respectively. The signals `in_data_toggle`, `out_data_toggle`, `in_data_toggle_returned`, and `out_data_toggle_flopped` collectively function to maintain a correct order and synchronization of data input and output. `Take_in_data` and `out_data_taken` do the job of indicating when new data is to be taken in and when the processed output has been taken by the downstream module. \n\nThe code can further be divided into different sections. The primary sections include parameter declarations, signal handling, and data synchronization across two clock domains. It provides facilities for controlling the flow of data between these domains which works crucially towards data integrity maintaining a stable data flow. The module also consists of a section of conditional execution that affects the output stage pipeline based on the defined parameters, indicating the dynamic nature of this module. Overall, the module provides a robust and efficient solution for managing cross-domain data transfers, providing a crucial component in multi-clock designs.",

                    "text": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser. \n\nModule specification: The `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` is a clock crossing buffer module operating to synchronize data transfer between two different clock domains. It utilizes Altera's standard synchronization module and pipeline processing with adjustable synchronization depth and modifiable data width. \nThere are several input ports in this module. These include the `in_clk` and `in_reset` signals which manage the timing and initialization. The `in_ready` and `in_valid` signals control the flow of input data, and `in_data` represents the actual multi-bit input data. An additional input port, `out_ready`, signifies whether the output module is prepared to accept new incoming data. \n\nIn terms of output ports, `out_ready` indicates that data on the module's end has been processed and is anticipating to be exported. The `out_valid` levels up to denote the point at which it's valid to read the output data, and `out_data` is the actual processed data that will be sent out from the system. \n\nInternally, the module dwells on multiple signals like `in_data_buffer` and `out_data_buffer` for the buffering of input and output data respectively. The signals `in_data_toggle`, `out_data_toggle`, `in_data_toggle_returned`, and `out_data_toggle_flopped` collectively function to maintain a correct order and synchronization of data input and output. `Take_in_data` and `out_data_taken` do the job of indicating when new data is to be taken in and when the processed output has been taken by the downstream module. \n\nThe code can further be divided into different sections. The primary sections include parameter declarations, signal handling, and data synchronization across two clock domains. It provides facilities for controlling the flow of data between these domains which works crucially towards data integrity maintaining a stable data flow. The module also consists of a section of conditional execution that affects the output stage pipeline based on the defined parameters, indicating the dynamic nature of this module. Overall, the module provides a robust and efficient solution for managing cross-domain data transfers, providing a crucial component in multi-clock designs."
