Comment: 
This line of code performs a pointer increment operation specifically for a FIFO write pointer. The implementation is done by adding 1 to the existing value of 'fifo_wrptr' variable and the result is assigned to 'fifo_wrptr_plus1'. This implies that after each write operation, the write pointer will be updated to point to the next index, maintaining the FIFO operation's consistency.
