    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a flip-flop used in state management enhanced with an active-low reset signal. It operates on the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of the reset signal. On encountering a drop in the reset signal (reset_n == 0), it sets the state of av_ld_waiting_for_data to 0. Otherwise, the state of av_ld_waiting_for_data will be updated with the value of av_ld_waiting_for_data_nxt at each clock's rising edge. This design allows for efficient state transition control in synchronous digital systems."
