This block of code enables the CPU address when certain conditions are valid. It utilizes the Verilog assignment statement to set the value of the E_cpu_addr_en signal equal to the value of the E_valid signal. Essentially, this line of code means that the CPU address enable signal (E_cpu_addr_en) is turned ON whenever the validity signal (E_valid) is true, tying the address enable to the state of the validity check.
