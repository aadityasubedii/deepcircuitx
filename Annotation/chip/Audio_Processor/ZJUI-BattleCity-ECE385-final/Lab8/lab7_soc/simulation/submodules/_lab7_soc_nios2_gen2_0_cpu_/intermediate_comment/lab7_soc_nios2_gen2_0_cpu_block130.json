    "block_comment": "This block of code is a Verilog RTL implementation of a flip-flop with an active-low synchronous reset. It is part of more complex design where the flip-flop 'R_ctrl_implicit_dst_retaddr' captures the next state 'R_ctrl_implicit_dst_retaddr_nxt' on a rising edge of clock 'clk' when a control signal 'R_en' is high. In case of an active low reset 'reset_n', it resets the flip flop to 0."
