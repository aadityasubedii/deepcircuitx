    "block_comment": "The block defines the enabling condition for a specific register in a FIFO queue, specifically the sixth element ('fifo_6_enable'). The enabling condition is determined by the current write pointer position ('fifo_wrptr') and the availability of input. If the write pointer is at position 6 and there's at least one input, or if there are at least two inputs free and the write pointer incremented by one or two equals 6, then the register is enabled. This applies backpressure control in an input buffer system."
