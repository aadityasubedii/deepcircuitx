    "block_comment": "This block primarily functions as a system state maintenance unit. The asynchronous reset path sets the 'start of packet' (`sop_ptr`) and 'in-packet error' (`error_in_pkt`) flags to zero. When `reset` is not high, on every rising edge of the clock, `sop_ptr` is set to the value of the write pointer (`wr_ptr`) whenever a new packet begins (`in_pkt_start`). An error flag (`error_in_pkt`) is cleared when an end of packet arrives (`in_pkt_eop_arrive`), but set when an error is detected during packet transmission (`in_pkt_error`) and the packet has either just started or is continuing (`pkt_has_started | in_pkt_start`). This efficiently facilitates real-time error detection and tracking of packet start positions."
