Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for generating a signal `ociram_reset_req` that requests a reset operation on the On-chip RAM (OCIRAM). The reset request (`reset_req`) signal originates externally and this block propagates it forward only if there is no active JTAG RAM access happening (`jtag_ram_access`), ensuring that critical debug operations aren't interrupted by a reset. The requirement for no active JTAG access ensures the hardware safety, eliminating risk of data corruption or loss due to simultaneous access and reset.
