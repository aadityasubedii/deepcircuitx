    "block_comment": "This block of code is a flip-flop that negates the empty flag signal from a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer. The module updates the 'dataavailable' flag whenever there is a change in the 'fifo_EF' signal, reversing its state. Thus, 'dataavailable' indicates the availability of data in the FIFO."
