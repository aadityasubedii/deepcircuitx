    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/* \nThis module implements a System-on-Chip (SoC) design for a lab project. It integrates a Nios II processor, SDRAM controller, PLL, JTAG UART, and custom interfaces. The module manages clock distribution, reset control, and interconnections between components using an interconnect fabric. It handles data flow between the processor, memory, and I/O interfaces, providing a complete embedded system platform for the lab project.\n*/"
