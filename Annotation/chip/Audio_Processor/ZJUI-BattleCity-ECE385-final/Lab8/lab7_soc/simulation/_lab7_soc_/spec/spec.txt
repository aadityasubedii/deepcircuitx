Module name: lab7_soc. Module specification: The lab7_soc module is a System-on-Chip (SoC) design for a lab project, integrating various components including a Nios II processor, SDRAM controller, PLL, JTAG UART, and custom interfaces. It features input ports for clock (clk_clk), reset (reset_reset_n), and OTG HPI data input (otg_hpi_data_in_port), along with numerous output ports for keycodes, OTG HPI control signals, and SDRAM interface signals. The module also includes an inout port for the SDRAM data bus (sdram_wire_dq). Internally, it utilizes signals for clock management, data and instruction interfaces for the Nios II processor, and various control signals for the interconnect fabric. The code is structured into several blocks
