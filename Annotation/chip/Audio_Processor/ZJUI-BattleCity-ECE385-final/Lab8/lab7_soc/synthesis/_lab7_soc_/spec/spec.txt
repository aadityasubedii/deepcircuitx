Module name: lab7_soc. Module specification: The lab7_soc module is a System-on-Chip (SoC) design for a lab project, integrating various components including a Nios II processor, SDRAM controller, PLL for clock generation, JTAG UART, and custom interfaces. It has input ports for clock (clk_clk), reset (reset_reset_n), and OTG HPI data input (otg_hpi_data_in_port), along with multiple output ports for keycodes, OTG HPI interface signals, and SDRAM control signals. The module uses a bidirectional port (sdram_wire_dq) for SDRAM data transfer. Internally, it utilizes numerous signals for interconnecting components, such as Nios II data and instruction master interfaces, JTAG UART slave interface, and memory interconn
