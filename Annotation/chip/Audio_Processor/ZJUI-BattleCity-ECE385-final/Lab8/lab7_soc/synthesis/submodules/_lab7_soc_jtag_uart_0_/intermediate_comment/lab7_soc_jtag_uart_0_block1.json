    "block_comment": "This block updates the \"dataavailable\" signal based on the value of the \"fifo_EF\" (probably indicating whether the FIFO is Empty or Full). The block contains a single always block that is triggered or sensitive to changes in the \"fifo_EF\" signal. When \"fifo_EF\" changes, it sets the \"dataavailable\" signal to the inverse of \"fifo_EF\". If the FIFO is empty, \"dataavailable\" becomes FALSE, indicating that no data is available. If the FIFO is not empty, \"dataavailable\" becomes TRUE, indicating that data is available."
