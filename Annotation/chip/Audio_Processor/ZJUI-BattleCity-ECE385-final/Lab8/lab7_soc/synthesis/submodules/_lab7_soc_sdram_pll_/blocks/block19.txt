Comment: 
This block of code is a digital edge-sensitive flip flop with preset and clear functions. It is triggered by the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of preset or clear signals. When the preset is low, it sets the output to a default high state, when the clear signal is low, the output is set to a default low state. However, on every rising clock edge, if enable signal is high, the output is updated to reflect the result of an AND operation between a previously stored value and the inverse of a reset signal. The assign statement is used to set the block's preset, enable and reset signals as high, high, and low, respectively, and propagate the flip flop output to the q output pin.
