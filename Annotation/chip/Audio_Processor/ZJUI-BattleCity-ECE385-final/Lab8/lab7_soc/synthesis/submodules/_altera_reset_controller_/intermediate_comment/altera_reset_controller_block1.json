    "block_comment": "The given code block is responsible for relay assignments of reset signals. Specifically, it assigns two signals, 'reset_out' and 'reset_req' using current values of 'r_sync_rst' and 'r_early_rst' respectively. These assignments are done in an 'always' block with the sensitivity list symbol \"@*\" indicating that assignments should happen whenever there are changes in the inputs to the block."
