    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the computation and status signals in an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). It implements a set of operations, including bitwise logic, arithmetic, shift, compare, and stall operations. Signals `E_arith_src1` and `E_arith_src2` are generated by conditional exclusive OR operation on source signals' most significant bit. The signal `E_arith_result` is set based on `E_alu_sub` selector. The memory base address signal `E_mem_baddr` is set by taking lower 29 bits of the arithmetic result. Based on `R_logic_op` condition, different bitwise logic operations are carried out on the sources, and the result is stored in `E_logic_result`. The comparison operations are controlled by `R_compare_op`, and the output is stored in `E_cmp_result`. The code also processes shift operations, where `E_shift_rot_cnt_nxt` is calculated based on the condition `E_new_inst`. The stall condition `E_stall` is a logical AND of various stall signals with the inversion of ECC valid signals."
