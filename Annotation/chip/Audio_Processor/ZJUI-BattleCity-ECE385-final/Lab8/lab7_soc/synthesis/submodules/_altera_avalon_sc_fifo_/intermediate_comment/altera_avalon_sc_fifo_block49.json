    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to control whether or not data is read from a register or memory. It does so by assigning the \"read\" signal to the result of a logical AND operation between the signals \"internal_out_ready\", \"internal_out_valid\", and \"ok_to_forward\". This means that data will only be read if the internal output is both ready and valid and it is acceptable to forward the data."
