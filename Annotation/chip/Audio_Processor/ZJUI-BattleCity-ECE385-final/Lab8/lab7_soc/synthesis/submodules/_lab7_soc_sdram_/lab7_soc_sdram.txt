Module-level comment: 

This is a SDRAM interaction system consisting of two main modules: lab7_soc_sdram_input_efifo_module, a FIFO container managing read and write data operations, and lab7_soc_sdram, an interface to a Synchronous Dynamic RAM. The FIFO handles data traffic with the help of multiple flags triggering operations on every clock rise; it also handles reset functionality. The SDRAM module, once initialized, uses multiple control signals for addressing, sending commands, refreshing operations and data transference. It also employs the FIFO module for smoother data operations.
