    "block_comment": "The block handles data output for a memory chip under certain conditions during clock signal transitions. When the active-low reset signal is asserted, it resets the data output to zero. Otherwise, it detects if the chip is selected by checking the 'chipselect' signal, if a write operation is not in progress, and if the relevant memory address matches. If all conditions are satisfied, the lower 8 bits of the 'writedata' input are assigned as the data output."
