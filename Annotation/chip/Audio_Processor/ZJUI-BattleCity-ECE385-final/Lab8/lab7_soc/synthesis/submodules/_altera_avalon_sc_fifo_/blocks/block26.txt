Comment: 
This block of code handles the reset and output conditions for a particular payload in a synchronous system. When a reset or a rising clock signal is triggered, the code block executes. If a reset signal is detected, the code sets both 'out_valid' and 'out_payload' to 0, essentially clearing their current states. In the absence of a reset signal, and upon detecting a signal in 'internal_out_ready' the block sets 'out_valid' to the boolean AND result of 'internal_out_valid' and 'ok_to_forward', and updates 'out_payload' to the value of 'internal_out_payload'. Thus, it controls the output validity and payload based on the system readiness and other internal signals.
