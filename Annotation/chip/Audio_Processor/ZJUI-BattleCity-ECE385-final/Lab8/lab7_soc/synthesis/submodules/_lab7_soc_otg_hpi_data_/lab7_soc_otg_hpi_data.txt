Module-level comment: This module, lab7_soc_otg_hpi_data, functions as a data interface for an OTG HPI in a SoC, supporting basic read/write operations. It accepts inputs for address, operation commands, data, system clock, reset, and chip select signals. Outputs are data read and data output. 'data_out' and 'readdata' registers are updated based on these inputs, while internal logic is used to control data flow based on address. 'out_port' is directly linked to 'data_out' register for output. The module's operations are driven by the system clock and are reset-able.
