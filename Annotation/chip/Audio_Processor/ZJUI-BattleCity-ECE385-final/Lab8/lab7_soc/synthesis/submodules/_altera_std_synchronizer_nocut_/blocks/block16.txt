This block updates a variable 'random' each clock cycle. If the reset_n signal is active, the random variable is assigned a new random number using a defined RANDOM_SEED value, else, it's assigned a simple random number genearted from the $random function. This ensures that the 'random' variable always holds a fresh random value at every positive edge of the clock, with a deterministic initial state if reset.
