    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for the functioning and data storage of a FIFO buffer, identified as 'fifo_4'. It uses a positive edge-sensitive clock signal for syncing and a negative edge active-low reset signal for initialising. When a low reset signal is detected, 'fifo_4' is cleared to the default state of 0. However, in the presence of a clock cycle and with 'fifo_4_enable' high, data is written into this FIFO buffer from the multiplexer 'fifo_4_mux'."
