    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a Nios II processor core with a 5-stage pipeline (fetch, decode, execute, memory, writeback). It handles instruction execution, memory operations, and interrupt processing. The core uses a Harvard architecture with separate instruction and data buses. It implements various instruction types, including arithmetic, logic, branch, and memory operations. The module manages pipeline hazards, handles exceptions, and supports debug features through the JTAG interface."
