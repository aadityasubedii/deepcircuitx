Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code checks for certain hardware error conditions. The operation of this code is synchronized with the rising edge of the clock signal. It first checks if the reset_n signal is high and in the case it is, it checks the i_read signal for indeterminate values. If undetermined value ('x') is found, it prints an error message to terminal showing the current simulation time along with the error message and then it stops the simulation.
