It handles both asynchronous and synchronous resets. The DEPTH parameter can be adjusted to change the number of flip-flops in the reset synchronizer chain. When an asynchronous reset is asserted, all elements in the chain are reset immediately. For synchronous reset, every clock edge shifts the reset through the elements in the chain. This chain of flip-flops synchronizes the reset signal to the clock, which helps in maintaining the signal stability and avoid metastability issues. The final synchronized reset signal 'reset_out' is taken from the output of the last flip-flop in the chain."
