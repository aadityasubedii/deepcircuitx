    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code describes a finite state machine (FSM) that directs the behavior of a memory control system. More specifically, the FSM is used to manage the read and write operations on the memory, and handle request updates. The FSM states indicate different stages of the read/write sequence, the checking of request flag, the computation of address or data, etc. The block also takes care of high level control signals such as reset, clock and update flags. The state transitions are determined by a combination of the current state and the input conditions such as if the control system has been initialized, if there is a refresh request or if the queue is empty. The states also affect various output vectors such as command, address, data, and count. Each state has the key commands laid out which determine the control flow in the memory. The default state handles any unidentified states by setting the system to its original state and clearing necessary flags."
