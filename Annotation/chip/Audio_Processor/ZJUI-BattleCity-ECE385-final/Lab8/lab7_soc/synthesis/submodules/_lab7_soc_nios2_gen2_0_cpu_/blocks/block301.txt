This block of the Verilog RTL code assigns the variable `fifo_1_mux` based on several conditions involving word pointers and overflow conditions. If `fifo_wrptr` equals 1 and `itm_valid` is true, `fifo_1_mux` is assigned the value of `itm`. In the event that `fifo_wrptr` equals 1 and `atm_valid` or `dtm_valid` is true, the variable is assigned the value of `overflow_pending_atm` or `overflow_pending_dtm` accordingly. The same conditions are tested for `fifo_wrptr_plus1` with the addition of `ge2_free`, where if all are true, `overflow_pending_atm` or `overflow_pending_dtm` is assigned to the variable based on whether `itm_valid`, `atm_valid` or `dtm_valid` are true. Lastly, if all conditions fail, `overflow_pending_dtm` is assigned as the last resort.
