    "block_comment": "This block is a positive-edge triggered sequential logic block, managing a FIFO queue of 8-bit width. Functioning as a flip-flop, the process is activated at the rising (positive) edge of the clock or if there's a negative edge on the reset line. If reset is active (low), it sets the FIFO queue to zero, effectively clearing it. Otherwise, if the FIFO queue is enabled, it allows data to be input into the FIFO queue from the `fifo_8_mux` line during each clock cycle."
