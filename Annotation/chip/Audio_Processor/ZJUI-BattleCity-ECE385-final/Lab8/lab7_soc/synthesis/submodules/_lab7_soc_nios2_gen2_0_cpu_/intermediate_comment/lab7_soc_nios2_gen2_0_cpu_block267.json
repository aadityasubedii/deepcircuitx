    "block_comment": "This block of code oversees the assignment of values to the 'fifo_13_mux' variable, this assignment is based on multiple incoming signals and conditions. The code utilises ternary operators that assign 'fifo_13_mux' one of four possible data inputs ('itm', 'overflow_pending_atm', 'overflow_pending_dtm') depending on a variety of conditional checks which heavily revolve around the 'fifo_wrptr' and 'fifo_wrptr_plus1' counters and the status of the 'itm_valid', 'atm_valid', 'dtm_valid', and 'ge2_free' flags. The overflow_pending data gets selected when certain conditions among write pointers, validation and free status signals are met otherwise 'overflow_pending_dtm' is chosen by default."
