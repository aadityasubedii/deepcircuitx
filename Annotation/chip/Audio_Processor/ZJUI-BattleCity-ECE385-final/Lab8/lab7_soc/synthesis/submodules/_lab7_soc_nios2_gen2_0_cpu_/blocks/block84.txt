This statement performs a simple register update function for a control shift rotator. Specifically, it assigns the value of 'D_ctrl_shift_rot', representing the current state of the shift rotator, to 'R_ctrl_shift_rot_nxt', which represents the next state. The semantic of this operation is mainly related to the way in which stateful computations are handled in hardware, in a pipelined design. The output of one stage (D_ctrl_shift_rot, the present stage) is used to update the input of the next stage (R_ctrl_shift_rot_nxt, the next stage).
