This block of Verilog code manages the fill level of a FIFO buffer. It assigns the fill level of the FIFO buffer to a variable fill_level. In the case where the empty latency is equal to 3, the fill_level is updated by adding the logical AND of the output validity signal (out_valid) with a zero padded to the length of the address width to the actual fill level. The block uses conditional if statement to implement this functionality.
