    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code acts as an asynchronous reset and synchronous update register for a control write signal in a digital system. On a negative edge of the reset signal (`reset_n`), the register (`R_ctrl_wrctl_inst`) is reset to its initial state (`0`). If the reset signal isn't active and the enable signal (`R_en`) is high at a positive clock edge, the state of register is updated based on the value of the next-state signal (`R_ctrl_wrctl_inst_nxt`)."
