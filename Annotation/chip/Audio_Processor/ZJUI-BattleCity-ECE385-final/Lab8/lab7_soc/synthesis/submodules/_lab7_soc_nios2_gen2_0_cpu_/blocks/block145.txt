This block is responsible for generating the register update conditions in synchrony with the system clock or upon an active low reset signal. It initializes or updates the value of 'W_status_reg_pie' according to these system state changes. When an active low signal resets the operation, the 'W_status_reg_pie' register value is set to 0. Otherwise, during a rising edge clock, 'W_status_reg_pie' updates to the value of 'W_status_reg_pie_nxt'. This implements a synchronous register with active low reset feature.
