    "block_comment": "This line of code refers to a non-blocking assignment operation in a Verilog RTL design. The block assigns the current value of the signal `D_ctrl_ld` to the signal `R_ctrl_ld_nxt` in the next clock cycle. The keyword `assign` indicates that this operation is intended to be carried out continuously, any time a change in the right-hand-side signal is observed."
