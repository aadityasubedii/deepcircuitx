    "block_comment": "This block of code function as a refresh counter with asynchronous reset. The purpose of this block is to perform the counter resetting to 10000 whenever a negative edge is detected on its reset signal. On a positive clock edge, it checks the value of the counter and updates it. Specifically, it resets the counter to 390 when it reaches zero and in other cases, it decrements the counter by one. This refresh counter is mainly used in hardware tasks that require a specific repeating pattern or timing control."
