Module name: lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_test_bench. Module specification: This module serves as a test bench for a NIOS II processor core, monitoring various signals and data paths to validate the processor's functionality. It has numerous input ports representing control signals, data buses, and status flags from different pipeline stages of the NIOS II processor, as well as memory interface signals and system-level inputs like clock and reset. The output ports include a filtered load data signal and a test completion indicator. Internally, the module uses a wide array of signals to decode instructions and check for specific operations. The code is structured into several sections: port declarations, internal signal declarations, instruction decoding logic, and a series of always blocks for error checking and signal monitoring. These blocks verify the validity of various signals, check for proper register write operations, memory read/write operations, and data alignment. The module also includes logic to filter
