    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a specific value to 'fifo_12_mux' based on the conditions met by various conditions involving 'fifo_wrptr', 'fifo_wrptr_plus1', 'itm_valid', 'atm_valid', 'dtm_valid', and 'ge2_free'. The decision branches are organized in a priority-encoded manner with each condition checking for equality with '4'd12' and validation of data ITM, ATM, and DTM. If these conditions are met, 'fifo_12_mux' will be assigned the appropriate overflow_pending value, otherwise, it defaults to 'overflow_pending_dtm'. The block essentially prioritizes and manages data overflow in the system."
