This block of code defines a synchronous reset mechanism for the control interrupt instance `R_ctrl_intr_inst`. When a negative edge reset (`reset_n` equals to 0) is triggered, it clears the `R_ctrl_intr_inst` by assigning it the value 0. If there's no reset and a positive clock edge (`R_en` equals to 1) is detected, it updates the value of `R_ctrl_intr_inst` with next state `R_ctrl_intr_inst_nxt`.
