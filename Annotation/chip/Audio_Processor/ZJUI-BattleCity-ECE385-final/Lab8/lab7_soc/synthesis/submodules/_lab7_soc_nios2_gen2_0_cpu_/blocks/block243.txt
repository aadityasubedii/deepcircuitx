This block of code is a typical design for Verilog 2-port SRAM module, acting as a dual-port memory element. The module includes two input ports for writing (addr_a and addr_b,) and two output ports for reading (dout_a and dout_b). The write-enable signal (wren) decides whether or not the new data (din) is written into the memory. The memory is operated using the write address (waddr_a and waddr_b) and read address (raddr_a and raddr_b) to write into or read from the specified memory address, respectively. During each clock cycle, new data can be written into or read from the memory at the determined addresses.
