    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a synchronous reset for the 'atm' and 'dtm' variables. Upon every rising edge of the clock ('clk') signal or falling edge of the reset ('jrst_n') signal, a conditional checking is performed based on the 'jrst_n' signal. In both cases, whether 'jrst_n' is 0 (indicating active reset condition) or not, it assigns the value 0 to both 'atm' and 'dtm'. Implicitly, this code suggests that the 'atm' and 'dtm' will reset independently on the condition of reset signal or at every rising edge of clock."
