This snippet of code assigns a value from `data_out` to `out_port`. Verilog's `assign` keyword is used in this conjunction, representing a continuous assignment statement. It represents a wired connection in hardware and updates `out_port` whenever `data_out` value changes. This facilitates the flow of data output from the internal system to an external receiver or system via the `out_port` port.
