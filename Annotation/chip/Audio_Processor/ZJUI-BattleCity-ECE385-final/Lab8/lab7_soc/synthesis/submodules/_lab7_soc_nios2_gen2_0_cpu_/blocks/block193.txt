Comment: 
This block of code describes a synchronous reset mechanism for a register named R_wr_dst_reg in a digital circuit. On every positive edge of the system clock (clk) or negative edge of the active-low reset signal(reset_n), the conditions within this block are checked. If the reset signal is active (represented by reset_n being 0), the R_wr_dst_reg register is cleared (set to 0). Otherwise, during normal operation (reset_n != 0), the value from another register D_wr_dst_reg is transferred to R_wr_dst_reg. This block provides a way to easily initialize the critical register to a known state in a synchronous manner.
