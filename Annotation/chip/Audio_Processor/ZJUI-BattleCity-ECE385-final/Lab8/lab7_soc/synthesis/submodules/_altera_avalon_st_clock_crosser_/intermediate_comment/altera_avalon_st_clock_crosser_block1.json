    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages signal assignments for data output. The internally computed validity of the output data is transmitted to the `out_valid` signal. In a similar vein, the readiness of the receiving end is copied to an internal `out_ready_internal` signal. Finally, the output data is sourced from the `out_data_buffer`. These operations are vital for controlling data flow and synchronization across different modules.\n"
