    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for assigning value to the `av_readdata` signal. The value of `av_readdata` is chosen conditionally; If the boolean `read_0` is true, the value is a concatenation of fixed bits, fifo status flags, and read data from fifo. However, if `read_0` is false, `av_readdata` contains a calculation of remaining space in the fifo buffer besides the fifo status flags and interrupt enable flags. This piece of code enables swapping between different sets of status and data, based on the `read_0` condition."
