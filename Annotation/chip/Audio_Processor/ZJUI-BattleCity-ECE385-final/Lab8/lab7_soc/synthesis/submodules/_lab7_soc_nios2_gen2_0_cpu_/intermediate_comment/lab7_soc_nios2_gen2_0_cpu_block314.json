    "block_comment": "This block of code implements an edge-sensitive logic for updating a fifo counter (`fifo_cnt_inc`). The counter increment value is determined based on the `empty`, `ge2_free`, `ge3_free` conditions and the value of `input_tm_cnt`. If `empty` is true, the first two bits of `input_tm_cnt` are assigned to `fifo_cnt_inc`. For non-empty conditions, if `ge3_free` is high and `input_tm_cnt`is 3, or if `ge2_free` is high and `input_tm_cnt` is at least 2, `fifo_cnt_inc` is set to 2 and 1, respectively. If `input_tm_cnt` is greater than or equal to 1, `fifo_cnt_inc` is set to 0. Otherwise, `fifo_cnt_inc` is set to a 5-bit value with all bits as 1."
