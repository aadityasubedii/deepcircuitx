This block contains two modules: lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_nios2_oci_itrace and lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_nios2_oci_dtrace. The first module is for handling instruction trace functionality in a Nios II processor system, monitoring activities like breakpoints, tracing control, and wrapping trace offs, as dictated by their inputs like trc_ctrl, trc_on, dbrk_traceoff, etc. The second module, on the other hand, manages data trace for the same Nios II system. It handles data-related activities for the processor such as reading data, writing data, addressing, and more, and depends on inputs like cpu_d_address, cpu_d_read, and cpu_d_write. The clk input in both modules signifies the system clock they are associated with.
