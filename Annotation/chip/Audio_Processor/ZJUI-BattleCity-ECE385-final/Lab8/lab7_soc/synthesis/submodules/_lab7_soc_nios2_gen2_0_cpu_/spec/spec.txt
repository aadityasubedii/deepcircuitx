Module name: lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu. Module specification: This module implements a Nios II processor core, containing logic for instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages of the processor pipeline. Key input ports include clk (system clock), reset_n (active-low reset), d_readdata (data read from memory), i_readdata (instruction read from memory), and irq (interrupt request signals). Output ports include d_address (data memory address), i_address (instruction memory address), d_writedata (data to be written to memory), and various control signals. Internal signals such as F_pc (program counter), D_iw (instruction word in decode stage), and E_alu_result (ALU result in execute stage) are used to manage the processor's state and operations. The module is structured into several blocks corresponding to different pipeline stages
