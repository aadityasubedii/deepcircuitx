This block of Verilog code manages a ready flag for accepting data based on the status of a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer. It triggers on either a rising edge of the clock signal (clk) or a falling edge of the reset signal (rst_n). When the reset signal goes low, the 'readyfordata' flag is set to 0, indicating that the system is not ready to accept data. When not in a reset state, the 'readyfordata' flag is set to be the inverse of 'fifo_FF', which can be used to imply whether FIFO is full or not. If 'fifo_FF' is 1 (indicating buffer is full), 'readyfordata' is 0, and vice versa.
