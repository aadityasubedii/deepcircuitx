This block of Verilog code is responsible for enabling the writing functionality for 'fifo_14'. This operation is dictated by the meeting of certain conditions. If either the write pointer 'fifo_wrptr' equals 14 and 'input_ge1' is high, or if 'ge2_free' is high and 'fifo_wrptr_plus1' equals 14 along with high 'input_ge2', or lastly if 'ge3_free' is high with 'fifo_wrptr_plus2' equals 14 in conjunction with a high 'input_ge3', the write functionality of 'fifo_14' will be enabled.
