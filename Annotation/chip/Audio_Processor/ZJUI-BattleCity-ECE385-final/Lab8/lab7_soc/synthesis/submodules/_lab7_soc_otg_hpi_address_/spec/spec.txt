Module name: lab7_soc_otg_hpi_address.
Module specification: The 'lab7_soc_otg_hpi_address' is a NOT gated write control mechanism driven by a system clock. It performs write operations to a 2-bit wide data register, 'data_out', when the 'chipselect' and 'write_n' signals are active, and the address is zero. The module includes input ports such as: 'address', a 2-bit port deciding the write condition; 'chipselect', a single bit selection signal; 'clk', the system clock input; 'reset_n', an active low reset signal; 'write_n', the NOT of write signal for conditional write operation; and 'writedata', a 32-bit input data. The output ports are 'out_port', mirroring 'data_out', and 'readdata', a 32-bit output connected to the bitwise AND operation between an address check and 'data_out'. The module uses internal signals such as 'clk_en', 'data_out', 'out_port', 'read_mux_out', and 'readdata' for its operation. The 'clk_en' signal, although defined, is unused. The 'data_out' register holds the 2 least significant bits of 'writedata' based on specific conditions. The 'read_mux_out' functions as a kind of mux output and 'readdata' functions for data reading. The module resets 'data_out' on a low 'reset_n' and conditionally writes 'writedata' to 'data_out' on each positive edge of the clock.
