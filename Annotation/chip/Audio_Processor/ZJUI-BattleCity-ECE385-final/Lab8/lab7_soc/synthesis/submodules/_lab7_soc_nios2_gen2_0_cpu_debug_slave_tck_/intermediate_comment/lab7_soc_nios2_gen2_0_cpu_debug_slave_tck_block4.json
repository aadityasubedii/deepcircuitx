    "block_comment": "This Verilog block manages signal synchronization through the use of an Altera standard synchronizer module. The block assigns the incoming signal 'jrst_n' to the 'unxcomplemented_resetxx2' signal. Then, the synchronizer is instantiated and configured to handle the 'monitor_ready' input signal under the control of 'tck' clock signal. Upon synchronization, the resulting signal is outputted as 'monitor_ready_sync'. The synchronizer operates under the presence of the previously assigned 'unxcomplemented_resetxx2' signal, used as the active-low reset."
