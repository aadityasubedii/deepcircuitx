    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the value assignment of a multiplexer (mux) named \"fifo_15_mux\" based on several conditions. The mux is designed in favour of \"itm\", \"atm\" and \"dtm\" signals which are conditionally assigned to \"fifo_15_mux\" based on the value of the \"fifo_wrptr\" and \"fifo_wrptr_plus1\" variables along with the validation of \"itm_valid\", \"atm_valid\", \"dtm_valid\" and \"ge2_free\" conditions. If neither \"itm\", \"atm\", nor \"dtm\" are selected based on those conditions, \"fifo_15_mux\" defaults to \"overflow_pending_dtm\". Notably, all the conditions are evaluated in a priority order until one matches, mimicking the behavior of a cascading if-else ladder logic."
