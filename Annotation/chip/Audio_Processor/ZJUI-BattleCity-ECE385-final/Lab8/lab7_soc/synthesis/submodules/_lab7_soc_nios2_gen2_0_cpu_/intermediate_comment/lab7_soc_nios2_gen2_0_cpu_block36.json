    "block_comment": "This block of code is functioning as an assignment operation in Verilog design. Its purpose is to assign the value of 'D_ctrl_ld_st_ex' to the variable 'R_ctrl_ld_st_ex_nxt' in the next state. The operation is done simply using the 'assign' keyword, to create a continuous assignment statement, which implies that whenever there is a change in the right-hand side expression ('D_ctrl_ld_st_ex'), that change will be reflected in the left-hand side variable ('R_ctrl_ld_st_ex_nxt') immediately. The '_nxt' in the left-hand side suggests it is the ensuing state of 'R_ctrl_ld_st_ex'."
