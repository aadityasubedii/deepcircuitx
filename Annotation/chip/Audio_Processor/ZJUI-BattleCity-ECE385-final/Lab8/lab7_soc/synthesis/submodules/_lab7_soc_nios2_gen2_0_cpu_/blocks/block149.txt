Comment: 
This block of code primarily manages the condition of the 'A_valid_from_M' signal in a synchronous sequential circuit. It updates the signal 'A_valid_from_M' based on clock-triggered events. On the negative edge of the 'reset_n' signal, if 'reset_n' is 0, the signal 'A_valid_from_M' is set to 0 which indicates a reset situation. Else, it takes the value of a logical AND operation between 'E_valid' and the logical NOT of 'E_stall. This implies that 'A_valid_from_M' is set to be valid only when 'E_valid' is valid and 'E_stall' is not stalling.
