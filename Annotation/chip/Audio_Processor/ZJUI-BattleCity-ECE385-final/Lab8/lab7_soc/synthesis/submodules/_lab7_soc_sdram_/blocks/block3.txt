This block of code is intended to provide on-screen instructions for simulating accesses to SDRAM using a vendor simulation model. It achieves its purpose by using the "$write" function in a sequential order to cleanly present a series of steps to the user. These steps cover three main areas: where to download and install the vendor model, how to include and instantiate it in the top-level system file and testbench signals, and finally, a note about potentially disabling some timing checks in the vendor model due to the zero-delay based nature of this particular simulation.
