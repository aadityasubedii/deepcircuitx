    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of `D_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison` based on a logical OR operation amongst various operation codes. The operation codes that are used in this operation are comparison ones which include greater than or equal to, less than, etc., both for immediate values and general values. This block of code is efficiently implementing a control signal for signed comparisons in a ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) of a CPU. Using a logical OR operation ensures that the ALU conducts a signed comparison if any single or multiple comparison operation codes are active."
