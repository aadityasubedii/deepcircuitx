Comment: 
This block is a module instantiation for the NIOS II processor with debug capabilities in a system-on-chip design. The instantiated module, `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_nios2_oci_debug`, provides the main processing unit of this hardware design and includes advanced features such as hardware breakpoints, debug request signals, and a reset mechanism. Inputs and outputs include signals for clock, reset, debug request, monitor status, hardware breakpoint request and signal to take necessary actions. The wires at the beginning of the block are used as signals in the instantiated module to control tracing actions and provide debug information.
