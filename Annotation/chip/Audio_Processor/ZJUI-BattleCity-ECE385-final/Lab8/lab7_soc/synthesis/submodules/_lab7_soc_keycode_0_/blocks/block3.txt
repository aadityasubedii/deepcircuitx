Comment: 
This block of code behaves as a synchronous reset and data write function for a specific chip. On the falling edge of 'reset_n', it resets 'data_out' to zero, ensuring a known state on reset. Meanwhile, on the rising edge of 'clk', if 'chipselect' is active, write operation is signalled by 'write_n' being deasserted and 'address' being zero, 'data_out' will be updated by the lower 16 bits of 'writedata'.
