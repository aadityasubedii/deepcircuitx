    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for updating the value of the 'E_xbrk_trigout' signal based on certain conditions. It receives input from clock 'clk', reset signal 'reset_n' and enable signal 'E_cpu_addr_en'. It also considers the 'xbrk_tout_hit' signal. When the negative edge of 'reset_n' occurs, 'E_xbrk_trigout' is reset to 0. If 'reset_n' is not 0 and 'E_cpu_addr_en' is high, 'E_xbrk_trigout' takes the value of 'xbrk_tout_hit' on positive edge of 'clk'. This block works synchronously with the provided clock signal."
