    "block_comment": "This block implements a simple synchronizer flip-flop. It is triggered by the rising edge of the clock signal or the falling edge of the reset signal. If the reset signal is inactive (i.e., logic 0), the input data (din_s1) is forcibly set to a certain value determined by a condition on rst_value; if rst_value is 0, din_s1 is set to 0; else, it is set to 1. If the reset signal is not active (i.e., not in reset mode), the input data (din_s1) simply follows the value of next_din_s1."
