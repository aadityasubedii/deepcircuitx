This block of code mainly manages the status flags and read operations for a depth adjustable memory module. Initially, it sets the 'full' flag according to the last element of 'mem_used', and 'empty' flag as the negation of the first element of the 'mem_used'. In case the DEPTH equals one, 'full' flag is set considering both the first element of 'mem_used' and the read status. The 'internal_out_payload' is assigned as the first element of the 'mem' array, which holds the memory status. If 'EMPTY_LATENCY' equals zero, a different condition is set for the 'empty' flag, based on 'mem_used', 'in_valid', and read operations are performed accordingly. However, if the memory is not used and 'in_valid' signal is high,'internal_out_payload' is assigned the 'in_payload' value directly.
