    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code serves to generate a conditionally asynchronous reset mechanism. When the `ASYNC_RESET` flag is set to `true`, this block initiates the start of a generate-construct that implements specific reset mechanisms which are intended to be written in the block. The mechanism of action enables the system to reset any required components asynchronously, which can be particularly helpful in larger designs that cannot be effectively managed using synchronous resets. The generate construct is noted to be left open-ended, indicative of the details that are yet to be filled based on specific reset requirements."
