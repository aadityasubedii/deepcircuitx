    "block_comment": "The provided block is designed to control and stabilize the \"control jump direct\" register based on the clock's rising edge or the \"reset_n\" signal's falling edge. At the negedge of \"reset_n\", the \"R_ctrl_jmp_direct\" register gets reset. On the posedge of the \"clk\", if \"R_en\" is high, the \"R_ctrl_jmp_direct\" register will be updated with the value of \"R_ctrl_jmp_direct_nxt\". These actions offer a way to synchronize transitions between multiple states.\n"
