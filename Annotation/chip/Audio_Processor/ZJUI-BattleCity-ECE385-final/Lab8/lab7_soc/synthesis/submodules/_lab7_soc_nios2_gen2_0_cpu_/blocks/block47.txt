This RTL code block is assigned to pass the 'D_ctrl_ld_ex' register value to the 'R_ctrl_ld_ex_nxt'. Specifically, the 'assign' keyword in verilog is a continuous assignment statement which continuously drives the 'R_ctrl_ld_ex_nxt' with the value of 'D_ctrl_ld_ex'. This serves, typically, as a register file management mechanism where the upcoming value for 'R_ctrl_ld_ex' is provisioned by 'D_ctrl_ld_ex'. This operation happens every clock cycle, making the register updated continuously.
