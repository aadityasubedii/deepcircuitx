    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to control the enabling of FIFO_3 unit within a Verilog design. It uses a combination of conditions to deduce whether FIFO_3 should be enabled. If the write pointer (fifo_wrptr) of the FIFO is at position 3 and there's at least one valuable input (input_ge1) or if the space for 2 (ge2_free) or more elements is free and the location of fifo_wrptr, incremented by one or two, is at 3 while having an available input (input_ge2 or input_ge3), in such cases the FIFO_3 is enabled."
