    "block_comment": "This refers to an asynchronous reset functionality and handling some control logic for break conditions. When an active low reset (`jrst_n`) is applied, the control variables for 'xbrk_ctrl' and 'trigbrktype' are reset to default state. If reset is not applied, these control variables are updated based on break conditions like 'take_action_any_break' or 'dbrk_break'. Further actions are decided based on 'take_action_break_b' and the value of 'break_b_rr'. Depending on these conditions, different bit positions of 'xbrk_ctrl' are updated from bits in 'jdo'. This kind of logic is commonly used in code for control flow or state machines in digital design."
