    "block_comment": "This block of code is a data storage and manipulation logic unit, in Verilog RTL code, which is primarily sensitive to the rising edges of two signals, 'clk' and 'reset'. If a reset occurs, the data fields 'data0' and 'data1' are cleared or set to zero. Otherwise, the block behaves differently according to the 'full0' and 'full1' flags. If 'full0' is not set, 'data0' is directly equivalent to the input data 'in_data'. If 'full1' is not set or if there is an active request to output data ('out_ready' and 'out_valid'), 'data1' is updated. Precisely, if 'full0' is set, 'data1' takes the value of 'data0', else 'data1' takes the value of 'in_data'."
