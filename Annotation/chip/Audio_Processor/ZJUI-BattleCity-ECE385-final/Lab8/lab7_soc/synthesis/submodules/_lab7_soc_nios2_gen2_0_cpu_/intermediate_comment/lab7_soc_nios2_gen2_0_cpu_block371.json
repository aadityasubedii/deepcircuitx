    "block_comment": "This block of code is the hardware implementation of the reaction to various system reset and debug conditions in a JTAG interface. Initially, with a negative edge of `jrst_n`, the block resets the `resetrequest`, `break_on_reset`, and `jtag_break`. For action on the ocimem_a interface, specific bits of `jdo` are then used to update `resetrequest`, `jtag_break`, `break_on_reset`, and `resetlatch`. In case of `reset_sync`, `jtag_break` and `resetlatch` are updated accordingly. If a debug request is made without corresponding acknowledgment and `break_on_reset` is enabled, `jtag_break` is set true. This ensures proper reset and debug operation handling."
