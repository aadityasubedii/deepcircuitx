    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling a register in the memory unit. Upon receiving a negative edge signal from 'reset_n', the module resets the value of the 'R_ctrl_mem8' register to zero, setting the memory state to its default. If 'reset_n' is not activated, the block checks 'R_en'. If 'R_en' is enabled (ideally during a positive clock edge), 'R_ctrl_mem8' adopts the value of 'R_ctrl_mem8_nxt' in the next state, facilitating read operation from a memory cell."
