    "block_comment": "This block of code represents the module \"lab7_soc_jtag_uart_0_sim_scfifo_r\". Functionally, it defines a hardware arrangement with specific responsibilities, including reading a synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory on rising edge of the clock, with additional reset edge case handling. In terms of implementation, the inputs to the module include a clock signal 'clk', read signals 'fifo_rd', and a negative reset signal 'rst_n'. Meanwhile, the module's outputs are empty FIFO signal 'fifo_EF', FIFO read data 'fifo_rdata', full FIFO indicator 'rfifo_full', and FIFO usage information 'rfifo_used'. These provide the necessary information and interfaces for the FIFO operations."
