    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code initializes various debug breakpoint (dbrk0) signals to inactive state. Each signal defined in this block, such as dbrk0_armed, dbrk0_trigout and others, are assigned a default value of '1b0' \u2013 a binary literal indicating off state. This means that the initial state for all these debug flags are set to 'not active', ensuring a clear, defined starting point for further operations involving these signals.\n"
