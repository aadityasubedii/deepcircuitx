Comment: 
This block of code controls the enabling of a specific location (at address 11) in a FIFO memory structure. The line determines whether the fifo_11_enable flag should be set by checking three conditions: (1) If the current write pointer is at position 11 and there is at least one input present, (2) If two or more inputs are available and the position next to the current write pointer is 11, (3) If three or more inputs are available and the position two steps next from the current write pointer is 11. These conditions ensure sequential and safe writing to the FIFO, preventing any potential overwrite or data loss scenarios.
