    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a value to the variable `fifo_10_mux` based on different conditions. It primarily checks whether `fifo_wrptr` equals '10' or `fifo_wrptr_plus1` equals '10' under which different values are assigned depending on the subsequent conditions. If `itm_valid` is true then `itm` is assigned else it checks other variables - `atm_valid` and `dtm_valid`. In case of `atm_valid`, `overflow_pending_atm` is assigned and in case of `dtm_valid`, `overflow_pending_dtm` is assigned. It also checks `ge2_free` along with different validity flags where `overflow_pending_atm` or `overflow_pending_dtm` are assigned based on conditions. If none of these conditions are satisfied, `overflow_pending_dtm` is assigned by default."
