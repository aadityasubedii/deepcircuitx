    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block governs the instantiation of a synchronizer module, specifically the `altera_std_synchronizer1`. The function of this synchronizer is to safely transfer data from one clock domain to another, thereby preventing metastable conditions. The `defparam` statement configures the `depth` parameter of the synchronizer module to 2. This means that the synchronizer contains two flip-flops in series, which get clocked sequentially to avoid metastability issues. The depth chosen can influence the probability of metastability, with a higher number reducing the chance of it occurring."
