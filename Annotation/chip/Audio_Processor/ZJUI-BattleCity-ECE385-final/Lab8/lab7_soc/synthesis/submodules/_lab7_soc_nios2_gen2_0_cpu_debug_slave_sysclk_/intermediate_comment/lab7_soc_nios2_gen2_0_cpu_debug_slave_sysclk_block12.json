    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block controls a set of state updates in synchrony with a clock signal. It functions by updating several signal states on the rising edge of the clock. In its implementation, the signals 'sync2_udr' and 'sync2_uir' hold the values of 'sync_udr' and 'sync_uir' from the preceding clock cycle. 'update_jdo_strobe' becomes high when 'sync_udr' sees a rising edge since this is where 'sync_udr' is high and 'sync2_udr' is low. 'enable_action_strobe' is updated to the value of 'update_jdo_strobe'. The assignment to 'jxuir' follows identical logic to 'update_jdo_strobe', activating when 'sync_uir' sees a rising edge.\n"
