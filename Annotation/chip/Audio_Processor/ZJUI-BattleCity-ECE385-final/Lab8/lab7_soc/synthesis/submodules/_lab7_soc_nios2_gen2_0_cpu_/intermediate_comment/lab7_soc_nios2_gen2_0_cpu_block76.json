    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates a synchronous reset and an asynchronous update of the 'R_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm' variable. When a negative edge occurs on 'reset_n', the 'R_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm' variable is reset to 0, providing a mechanism for initiating a system reset. If there's not a reset and a positive edge occurs on 'clk' and if 'R_en' is active, the variable 'R_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm' is assigned with the next state value - 'R_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm_nxt', allowing updates to be sampled at the rising edge of the clock."
