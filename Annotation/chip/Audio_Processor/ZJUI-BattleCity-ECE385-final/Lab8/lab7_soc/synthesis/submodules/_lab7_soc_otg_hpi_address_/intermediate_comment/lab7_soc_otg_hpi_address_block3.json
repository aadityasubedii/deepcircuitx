    "block_comment": "The function of this code block is to handle data input/output operations conditional on the states of various flags and signals. The implementation adheres to typical synchronous design principles. When 'reset_n' flag goes low, assuming active low reset system design, it clears the 'data_out' output. During a clock cycle, if the 'chipselect' is enabled, a write operation is not in progress (indicated by '~write_n'), and the 'address' flag is 0, it assigns the last two bits of 'writedata' onto 'data_out'."
