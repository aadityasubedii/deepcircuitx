Comment: 
This line of code defines a continuous assignment statement in Verilog. It specifies that the 'R_ctrl_break_nxt' signal should always carry the same value as the 'D_ctrl_break'. Whenever 'D_ctrl_break' value changes, 'R_ctrl_break_nxt' will be updated immediately without waiting for clock signal. This is typical in dataflow modeling where values propagate from source to destination as soon as they are changed.
