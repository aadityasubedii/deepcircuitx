    "module": "Module-level comment: This is a memory system module named 'lab7_soc_keycode_0' providing two slots for reading and writing data. The module operates with six input ports including address, chipselect, clk, reset_n, write_n, writedata, and two output ports out_port and readdata. The operation is synchronized with 'clk' and can be reset with 'reset_n'. Different internal signals are used to manage data flow. The code is divided into three sections: assigning internal signals, managing data storage, and designating output values, ensuring efficient functioning of the module."
