The block of code assigns an inverted value of the 9th bit of the 'trc_ctrl' signal to the 'trc_on_chip' signal. The functionality is achieved using the 'assign' keyword for continuous assignment and the bitwise negation operator '~'. This operation results in 'trc_on_chip' having a high value when the 9th bit of 'trc_ctrl' is low, and vice versa. The code block utilizes bitwise operations and continuous assignment in Verilog to achieve the intended toggling functionality.
