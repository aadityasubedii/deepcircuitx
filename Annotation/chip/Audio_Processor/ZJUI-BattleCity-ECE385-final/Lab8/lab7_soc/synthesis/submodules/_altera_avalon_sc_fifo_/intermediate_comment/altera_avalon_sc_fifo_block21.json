    "block_comment": "This block of code defines an always block that is triggered on the rising edge of a clock (clk) or a reset. If the reset signal is high, the FIFO fill level is set to zero, effectively clearing the FIFO. If the next_full signal is high and drop_on_error signal is not set, it sets the fifo_fill_level to the maximum value defined by depth32 for the bits 0 through ADDR_WIDTH. If both conditions are false, the block sets the `(ADDR_WIDTH)`-th bit of fifo_fill_level to 0 and uses subtraction of the `next_rd_ptr` from the `next_wr_ptr` to calculate the FIFO fill level."
