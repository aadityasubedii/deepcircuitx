This block of Verilog code implements a finite state machine (FSM) with different states and functionality. Upon arrival of a positive clock edge or a negative reset edge, the system evaluates its states. If the reset bit is 0, the block initializes all state variables to their default conditions. The states are regulated by the 'i_state' variable, where each binary code correponds to a specific behaviour characterized by the setting of control variables such as 'i_cmd', 'i_refs', 'i_count' etc. The FSM transitions between states based on the contents of these control variables and the 'refresh_counter'. Therefore, the block essentially controls the operation and behaviour of the system across various states in a synchronized recurrent manner.
