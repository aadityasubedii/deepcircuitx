    "block_comment": "The block functions as a logic control segment for a CPU addressing scheme and for determining hits in a debugging/breakpoint environment. The cpu_i_address is defined from 'F_pc', extending with 2'b00. Address enablements are signaled by 'D_valid' and 'E_valid' stages, respectively. There are various types of breakpoints (xbrk0, xbrk1, etc.) associated with different conditions, initially assigned to 0 indicating no hit. A hit is captured when a corresponding debug hit (break, ton, toff, tout, goto0, goto1) from any xbrk happens as per the OR logic operation in the final assigns."
