Comment: 
This block of code serves as a synchronous reset sequence and state transition for a control storage register (`R_ctrl_st_ex`), controlled by an enable signal (`R_en`). Predominantly, the register `R_ctrl_st_ex` is either reset during a negative clock edge when `reset_n` signal is asserted low or updated in a positive clock edge with the next state (`R_ctrl_st_ex_nxt`) when the enable signal `R_en` is set high.
