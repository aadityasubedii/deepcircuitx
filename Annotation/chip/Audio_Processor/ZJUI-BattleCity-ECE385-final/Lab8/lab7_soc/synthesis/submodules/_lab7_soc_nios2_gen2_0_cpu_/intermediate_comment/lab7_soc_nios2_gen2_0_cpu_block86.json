    "block_comment": "This block is a Register (R_ctrl_shift_rot_right) update logic, which is updated at every positive edge of the clock or at a falling edge of reset (reset_n). The register is asynchronously reset when reset_n is low, forcing R_ctrl_shift_rot_right to be '0'. In absence of the reset signal, when the enable control signal (R_en) is high the register captures the future value (R_ctrl_shift_rot_right_nxt)."
