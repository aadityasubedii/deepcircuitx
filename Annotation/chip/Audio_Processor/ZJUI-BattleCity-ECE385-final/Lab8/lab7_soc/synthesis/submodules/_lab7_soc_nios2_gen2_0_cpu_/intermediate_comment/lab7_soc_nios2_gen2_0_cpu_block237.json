    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for setting the memory parameter of a processor built with a 'lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_ociram' general purpose NIOS II processor. Depending on if 'NO_PLI' is defined or not, this block will choose different format files as the default content for the on-chip RAM. If 'NO_PLI' is defined, it sets the '.lpm_file' parameter to a '.dat' file, else, it uses a '.hex' file. This ensures that the correct input format is utilized for the onboard RAM default contents, ensuring the flexibility and accuracy of the memory initialization according to the different operating conditions."
