    "block_comment": "This snippet of Verilog RTL code manages the current Start Of Packet (SOP) pointer using a conditional assignment. If the 'write' signal is high and the packet input signals 'in_startofpacket' and 'in_endofpacket' are both true, the current SOP pointer 'curr_sop_ptr' is assigned the value of 'wr_ptr'. Otherwise, it retains its previous value 'sop_ptr'."
