    "block_comment": "This block of code designs a synchronous sequential logic circuit in Verilog RTL. The circuit resets the `readdata` register to zero when a negative edge reset signal `(reset_n == 0)` is detected. If there isn't a reset signal, if the `clk_en` signal is active, the circuit assigns the value of `read_mux_out` to the `readdata` register during the positive edge clock cycle, effectively creating a 32 bit read data from the multiplexer output."
