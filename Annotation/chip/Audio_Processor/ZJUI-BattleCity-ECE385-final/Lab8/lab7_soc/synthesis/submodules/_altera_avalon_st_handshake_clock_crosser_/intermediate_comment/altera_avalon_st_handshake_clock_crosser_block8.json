    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code presented constructs a simple data register. This register is designed to hold a piece of data and change its output based on the input signals. The register triggers on a positive edge clock cycle. If the reset signal is set, the register is instantly cleaned and is set to 0. If the enable signal is activated and reset is not triggered, the data in is stored into the register on the next positive clock cycle. Thus, the block manages input, output and intermediary data based on control signals."
