    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a register operation tied to state changes of the system clock or a reset condition. When a negative edge reset condition (denoting active low) is triggered, it resets the `R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison` to zero. However, during positive edge of the clock cycle and if the enable signal `R_en` is high, the next state of `R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison` is captured from the signal `R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison_nxt`."
