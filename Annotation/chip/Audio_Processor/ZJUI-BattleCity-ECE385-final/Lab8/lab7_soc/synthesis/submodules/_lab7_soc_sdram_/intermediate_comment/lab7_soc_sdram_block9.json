    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for generating a read strobe signal when a certain condition is met. The code does this by assigning the binary value of 'rd_strobe' based on the comparison of the least significant three bits of 'm_cmd' with the hexadecimal value '5', which is binary '101'. If these three bits equal to '101', the 'rd_strobe' signal will be set to '1'; otherwise, it will be '0'."
