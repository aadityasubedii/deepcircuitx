    "block_comment": "The block of code is a data register (dreg) update module in synchronous digital systems. This block is particularly sensitive to the positive edge of the system clock (clk), or the negative edge of system reset (reset_n). During a system reset, when reset_n is 0, the register (dreg) is cleared to '0' for all its bits up to the depth. Otherwise, in regular operations during the positive edge of the clock cycle, the register (dreg) captures and stores the input data (din_s1)."
