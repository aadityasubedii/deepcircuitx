Module-level comment: This module, `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_debug_slave_wrapper`, encapsulates a system debug interface in a SoC design with a Nios II Gen2 CPU. It has various inputs for monitoring and controls and gives a single data output `jdo`. It also has controls signalling actions/inactions in response to various conditions. Internally, it includes two sub-modules operating with system clock and test clock for system and testing oriented functionalities. It uses numerous internal signals, mainly for JTAG interface operations. Default JTAG operations are set via the signal assignments towards the end of the module.
