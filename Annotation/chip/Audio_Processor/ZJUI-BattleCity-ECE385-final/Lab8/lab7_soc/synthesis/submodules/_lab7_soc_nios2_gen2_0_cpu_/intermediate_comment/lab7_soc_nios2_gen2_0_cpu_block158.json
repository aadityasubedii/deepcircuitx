    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code describes a synchronous flip-flop with active low reset function. Upon the falling edge of the reset (when reset_n == 0), it resets the output, 'av_ld_waiting_for_data', to 0. During the rising edge of the clock (clk), the output is updated with the next state value, 'av_ld_waiting_for_data_nxt'."
