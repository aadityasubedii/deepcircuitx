    "spec": "Module name: lab7_soc_keycode. \n\nModule specification: The lab7_soc_keycode module is a component designed to perform simple write and read operations in a larger digital system, specifically a system-on-chip (SoC). It receives an address, a chip select signal, a clock, a reset_n signal, a write_n signal, and 32-bits of write data as inputs, and delivers an 8-bit wide byte and 32-bits of read data as outputs. Functional operation of the module is mainly governed by four internal signals: clk_en, data_out, out_port, read_mux_out, and readdata. clk_en isn't incorporated in the main functionality - it's simply assigned to '1'. The data_out is a register storing the least significant byte of write data whenever the chip is selected (chipselect is high) and write operation is initiated (write_n is low) with an address input of zero. out_port is a wire echoing the value in data_out to the outgoing port. The readdata output port shows a 32-bit modified version of the 'data_out' register. It's generated by zero extending 'read_mux_out' from 8 to 32 bits, providing 'data_out' if the address is zero, otherwise, it shows zero. The module's operations are controlled by the states of these inputs and internal signals, resulting in the activation and deactivation of data writing and reading, as well as output selecting, thereby providing the necessary functionality of a key component of a larger SoC design.",

It takes an address, a chip select signal, a clock, a reset_n signal, a write_n signal and 32-bits of write data as inputs and turns out a byte-wide output port and 32-bits of read data. The clocked process latch the least significant byte of write data whenever chip select signal and negated write_n are high and the address is zero. The output, \"out_port\", drives the latched data, and the read data \"readdata\" shows the result of ANDing the latched data with a byte-wide mask where every bit corresponds to the comparison of the address being zero. For address equal to zero, the latches data is shown unmodified; otherwise, the output is zeroed. If reset_n is driven low, the latched data is asynchronously cleared."

It essentially activates or deactivates the internal data write operation.\n3. clk: This is the clock input to the module. The internal data storage updates asynchronously according to this clock signal.\n4. reset_n: This active-low input port is responsible for resetting the state of the module i.e., resetting the data storage to zero.\n5. write_n: This active-low input initiates the write operation into the data storage when the chip is selected.\n6. writedata: A 32-bit wide input port where incoming data is presented to be written into the module's data storage when write_n is active and chip is selected.\n\nOutput Ports:\n1. out_port: This 8-bit wide output port presents the contents of the internal data storage (latched from the MSB of writedata) to the outside environment.\n2. readdata: This 32-bit wide output port shows the 8-bit internal data (from data_out) ANDed with a mask determined by the address input. When address is not zero, the output is masked to zero; when the address is zero, it outputs the 8-bit data concatenated 4 times.\n\nThe read and write operations within this module serve to interface with a larger system, which could be a much larger digital system like a processor or a digital communication system. The module acts as a small functional unit of a system-on-chip (SoC), delivering specific functionality within the overall SoC design."

However, in this example, it's not incorporated in the main functionality of the code - it's just assigned to '1' .\n\n2. data_out: This is a register which holds the latched LSB byte of the writedata input, whenever the chip select and write_n signals are high and an address of zero is selected. It will reset asynchronously to zero whenever reset_n goes low. Its state is updated at every positive edge of the clock.\n\n3. out_port: This is a wire assigned to the value of 'data_out'. It's just mirroring the value in 'data_out' to the outgoing port, regularly updated to match the latched, written data or reset value.\n\n4. read_mux_out: This is a wire connecting the output of a bitwise AND operation and is used to create the mask for the readdata output. It takes the 'data_out' register value and under valid address zero condition, it passes the 'data_out' value down to 'readdata'. \n\n5. readdata: This is a wire signal which is intended to present the masked version of the 32-bit data output.
