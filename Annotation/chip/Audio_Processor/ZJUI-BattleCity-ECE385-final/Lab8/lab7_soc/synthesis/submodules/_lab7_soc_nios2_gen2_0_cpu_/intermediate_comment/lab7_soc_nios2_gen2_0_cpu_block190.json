    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is implementing a flip-flop with asynchronous reset functionality. The flip-flop captures and stores the value of `D_compare_op` signal at every rising edge of clock (`clk`) if the `reset_n` signal is high. But in the case of active low `reset_n`, the output `R_compare_op` is reset to a default value of 0, regardless of the clock edge. This immediate response to the `reset_n` signal makes it an asynchronous reset operation."
