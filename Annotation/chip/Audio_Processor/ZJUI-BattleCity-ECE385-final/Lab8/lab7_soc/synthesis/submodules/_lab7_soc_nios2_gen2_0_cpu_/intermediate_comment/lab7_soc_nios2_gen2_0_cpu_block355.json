    "block_comment": "The provided block of Verilog RTL code serves as the input declaration for a module. These inputs are used for various control and data flow purposes within the module. Critical inputs include a system clock (`clk`), an asynchronous reset (`reset_n`), and a 27-bit program counter (`F_pc`). Additionally, it includes validation flag (`E_valid`) and certain trigger states (`trigger_state_0`, `trigger_state_1`). There are also four 8-bit control inputs (`xbrk_ctrl0`, `xbrk_ctrl1`, `xbrk_ctrl2`, `xbrk_ctrl3`) possibly used for more granular control or multiplexing operations within the module."
