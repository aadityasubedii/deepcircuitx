    "block_comment": "This block is a clocked or reset digital circuit. It responds to positive edges of the clock signal or negative edges of the reset signal. At a negative reset edge, it performs some action that is not defined here. When the i_read signal is high and if there's an undefined value 'x' in the input i_address, it triggers a print statement that shows an error message along with the simulation time and halts the system execution with the $stop command."
