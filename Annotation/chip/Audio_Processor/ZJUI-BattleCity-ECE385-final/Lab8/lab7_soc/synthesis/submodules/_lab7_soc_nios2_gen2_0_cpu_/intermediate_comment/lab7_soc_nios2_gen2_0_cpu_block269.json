    "block_comment": "The block enables the 13th FIFO memory element. It assigns \"fifo_13_enable\" HIGH when either of three conditions is met: 1) the write pointer is currently pointing to the 13th position and there is at least one input data ('input_ge1' is HIGH); 2) the write pointer will point to the 13th position after next cycle ('fifo_wrptr_plus1' equals 13) and there are at least two inputs ('input_ge2' is HIGH) and the element to be written is free ('ge2_free' is HIGH); 3) the write pointer will point to the 13th position after two cycles ('fifo_wrptr_plus2' equals 13), there are more than two inputs ('input_ge3' is HIGH) and the element to be written is free ('ge3_free' is HIGH)."
