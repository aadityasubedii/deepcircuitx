    "block_comment": "The provided block of code primarily handles signal assignments pertaining to elements such as trace control, validity checks for instruction trace marker (itm), address trace marker (atm), and data trace marker (dtm) signals, status of FIFO storage, and operations related to FIFO write pointers. Trace control is achieved through logical operations on variables like 'trc_on', 'dbrk_traceon' etc. Similarly, validity of itm, atm, and dtm are determined through bitwise OR operations. FIFO status updates and write pointer operations are all executed through arithmetic and bitwise operations on the 'fifo_cnt' and 'fifo_wrptr' variables."
