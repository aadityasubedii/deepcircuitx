This block of code enables a certain stage (stage 7 or 'fifo_7') of the FIFO buffer used for capturing incoming data. The block uses if-else conditions that depend on the current write pointer position (fifo_wrptr, fifo_wrptr_plus1, fifo_wrptr_plus2) and flags indicating available space in the buffer (input_ge1, input_ge2, input_ge3). The FIFO buffer stage 7 is enabled when the write pointer is on position 7 and there is at least 1 space left (input_ge1 equals to 1), or when there are 2 spaces left and the write pointer is at position 6 (ge2_free equals to 1), or when there are 3 spaces left and the write pointer is at position 5 (ge3_free equals to 1).
