    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, lab7_soc_mm_interconnect_0_avalon_st_adapter, acts as a streaming interconnect adapter, validating instantiation parameters and connecting to an error_adapter for signal processing. Input/output signals include data, validity, readiness, and error indicators. Internally, conditional 'generate if' blocks confirm parameter correctness, halting execution and flagging an error if requirements are not met. A separate module 'error_adapter_0' is instantiated to manage signal processing and error detection. Together, these designs ensure smooth and error-free data exchange."
