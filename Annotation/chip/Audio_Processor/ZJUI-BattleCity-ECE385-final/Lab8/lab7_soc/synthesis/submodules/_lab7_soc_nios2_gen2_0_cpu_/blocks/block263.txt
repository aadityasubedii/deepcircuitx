This block of code is used to enable the fifteenth place in a FIFO memory component. It leverages two key conditions to manage writing data into this specific location, factoring in the constraints of the FIFO's write pointer (fifo_wrptr) and following inputs (input_ge1, input_ge2, input_ge3). The block first checks if the write pointer is in place '15' and verifying input_ge1. Alternatively, it establishes the availability of place '15' for inputs ge2 and ge3 if they are free and the incremented write pointers (fifo_wrptr_plus1 / fifo_wrptr_plus2) point to '15'.
