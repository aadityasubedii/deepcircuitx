    "block_comment": "The block assigns the value to `D_ctrl_shift_logical`. The assignment is computed as a logical OR operation among the values of `D_op_slli`, `D_op_sll`, `D_op_srli`, and `D_op_srl`. If any of these individual signals are high ('1'), then the result will be high, indicating that a shift operation (either logical left or logical right) is required."
