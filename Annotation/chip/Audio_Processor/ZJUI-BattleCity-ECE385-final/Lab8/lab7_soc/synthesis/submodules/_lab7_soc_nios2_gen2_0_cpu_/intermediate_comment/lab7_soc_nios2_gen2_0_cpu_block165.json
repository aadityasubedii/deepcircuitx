    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is for generating memory byte enable signals (E_mem_byte_en), specifically used during byte or half-word data memory transactions. The control signals (D_ctrl_mem16 and D_ctrl_mem8) and 2 LSBs of the byte address (E_mem_baddr[1:0]) are used in a conditional assignment to determine the enable signals. If D_ctrl_mem16 and D_ctrl_mem8 corresponding to byte-select and half-word-select are '01 and '00 respectively, and depending on the value of the byte address, one of the four signals of the byte enable signal will be set. Similarly, when they are '10, depending on the byte address, two specific signals will be set. If the condition doesn't match any of the above, all the signals of byte enable will be set, allowing access to the entire word in memory."
