The function of the block is to control the reading process from a FIFO and manage the remaining number of bytes to read. This block functions under the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of reset signal. When the reset signal is low, it initializes the 'bytes_left' and 'fifo_rd_d' values to '0'. If the reset is not active, it retrieves data from the FIFO, decrements the 'bytes_left' if data is being read (when 'fifo_rd_d' is '1'), and resets 'bytes_left' to 'num_bytes' when a new read operation is initiated (when 'new_rom' is '1').
