    "block_comment": "The module \"lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_nios2_oci\" appears to be a component of a CPU implemented in the Nios II Gen 2 architecture. It serves as a bridge between the CPU and external memory (OCI), handling interrupts, resetting requests, reading and writing data, and debugging tasks. The various input and output ports facilitate this. For instance, read and write functionalities are handled with ports like \"d_read\", \"d_write\", \"read_nxt\", \"write_nxt\", and \"writedata_nxt\". Ports like \"reset\", \"reset_n\", and \"reset_req\" are for reset operations while \"clk\" is the system clock. Debugging is carried out via \"debugaccess_nxt\" and \"debug_mem_slave_debugaccess_to_roms\"."
