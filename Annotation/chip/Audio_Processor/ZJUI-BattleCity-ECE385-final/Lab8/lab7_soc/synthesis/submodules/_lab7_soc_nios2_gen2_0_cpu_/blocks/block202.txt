Comment: 
The block of code functions as a Flip-Flop with synchronous reset operation in a Verilog RTL design. It is clocked by a positive edge trigger signal 'clk', and can also be reset by a negative edge triggered 'reset_n' signal. If the 'reset_n' signal is low, the Flip-Flop clears the data input 'D_iw' to 0. When there is a positive clock edge and the 'F_valid' signal is high, the 'D_iw' data input takes the value of 'F_iw'.
