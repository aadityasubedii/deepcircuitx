    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is used to assign a specific value to the 'D_ctrl_src2_choose_imm' signal based on the logical OR of several operation codes. These operation codes range from 'D_op_addi' to 'D_op_srai'. This block primarily decides if the second source for a data operation control should be an immediate operand, based on the opcode. The assignment is made true if any of the provided opcodes are active. It covers arithmetic, jump, load-store and shift operations, where an immediate value is typically put into use."
