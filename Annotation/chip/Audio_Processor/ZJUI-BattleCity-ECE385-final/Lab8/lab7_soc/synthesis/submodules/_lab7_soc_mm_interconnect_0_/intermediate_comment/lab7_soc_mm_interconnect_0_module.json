    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module implements an interconnect for a SoC, facilitating communication between components like NIOS II, SDRAM, and JTAG UART. It uses a network of routers, multiplexers, and demultiplexers to manage data routing and clock domain crossing. The module implements the Avalon interface protocol and handles complex routing logic to enable data transfer between components operating at different clock frequencies.\n*/"
