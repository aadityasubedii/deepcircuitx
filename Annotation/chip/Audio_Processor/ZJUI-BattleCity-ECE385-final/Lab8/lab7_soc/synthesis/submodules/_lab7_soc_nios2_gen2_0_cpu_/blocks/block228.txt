This block of Verilog RTL code describes interconnection of various signals in a component or module. Primarily, the block connects CPU write and data signals, memory address, read, and wait requests along with write commands. It also handles the debug break signals, signals for enabling/disabling tracing, output triggers for debug break, acknowledgment of debugging activity, and a not-reset signal. Broadly speaking, these connections form the backbone of control and data flow in the implemented system. The debug signals particularly aid in system checks and performance angles.
