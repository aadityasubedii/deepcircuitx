    "module": "Module-level comment: The module 'lab7_soc_otg_hpi_cs' is part of an SOC and facilitates write and readback operations. It takes inputs like 'address', 'chipselect', 'clk', 'reset_n', 'write_n', and 'writedata'. When 'chipselect' and 'write_n' are active, and 'address' is 0, 'writedata' is stored into 'data_out'. 'out_port' is data_out's output equivalent and 'readdata' allows reading 'data_out' contents at address 0. All operations are synchronized with 'clk' signal."
