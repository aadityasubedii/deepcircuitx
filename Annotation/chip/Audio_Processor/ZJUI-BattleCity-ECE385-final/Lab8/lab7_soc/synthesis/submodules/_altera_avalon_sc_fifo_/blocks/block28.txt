Comment: 
This block of code handles signal generation for data forward validation. Specifically, it introduces a combinational logic block that assigns the logical AND of the negated 'empty' signal and 'ok_to_forward' signal to 'internal_out_valid'. The 'internal_out_valid' signal is asserted when the queue is not empty and the forward operation is permissible, suggesting that a forward operation can be performed.
