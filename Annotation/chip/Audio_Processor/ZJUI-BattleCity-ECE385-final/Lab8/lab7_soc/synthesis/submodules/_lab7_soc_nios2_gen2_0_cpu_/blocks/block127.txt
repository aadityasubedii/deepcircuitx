This block defines a synchronous reset and an asynchronous load operation in a register. When a negative edge reset (`reset_n == 0`) is detected, it asynchronously sets the `R_ctrl_custom_multi` register to `0`. However, on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`), and if `R_en` (presumably the register enable signal) is asserted, the block assigns the next state `R_ctrl_custom_multi_nxt` to the actual register `R_ctrl_custom_multi`.
