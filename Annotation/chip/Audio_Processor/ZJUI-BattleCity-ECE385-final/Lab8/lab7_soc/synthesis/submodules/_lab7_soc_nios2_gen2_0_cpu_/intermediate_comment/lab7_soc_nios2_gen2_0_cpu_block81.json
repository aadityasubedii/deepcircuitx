    "block_comment": "The block of code performs synchronization and state control in a system based on a system clock and reset signals. When a negative reset trigger is noticed, the state-control register `R_ctrl_logic` is cleared (set to 0); otherwise, on every positive edge of the system clock, if the enabling signal `R_en` is high, the state-control register `R_ctrl_logic` is updated with the next state value `R_ctrl_logic_nxt`."
