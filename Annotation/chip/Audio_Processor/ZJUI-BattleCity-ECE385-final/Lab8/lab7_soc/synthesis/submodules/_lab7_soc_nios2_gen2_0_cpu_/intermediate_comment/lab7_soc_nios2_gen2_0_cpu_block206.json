    "block_comment": "This block implements a synchronous reset for the 'hbreak_pending' signal. The resetting process happens at the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the 'reset_n' signal. If 'reset_n' equals 0, 'hbreak_pending' is forced to 0, effectively resetting. In other situations, 'hbreak_pending' is assigned the value of 'hbreak_pending_nxt'."
