    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronous hardware design described in Verilog RTL. It performs reset functionality for the `W_cdsr_reg` register. Using either a rising-edge clock signal or a falling-edge reset signal as the trigger, the block checks the status of the reset signal `reset_n`. If `reset_n` is found to be 0 (indicating an active reset condition), it assigns a value of 0 to the `W_cdsr_reg` register. In all other scenarios, it also assigns a value of 0 to the `W_cdsr_reg` register. Thus, upon every occurrence of a clock pulse or a reset event, the register `W_cdsr_reg` is driven to a default state of 0."
