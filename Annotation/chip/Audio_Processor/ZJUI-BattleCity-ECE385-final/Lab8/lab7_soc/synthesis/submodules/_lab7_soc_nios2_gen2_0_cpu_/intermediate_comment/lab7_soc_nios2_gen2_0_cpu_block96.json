    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for assigning a new value to the register R_ctrl_shift_logical. The value for this register in the next state, 'R_ctrl_shift_logical_nxt', is assigned the current state value of D_ctrl_shift_logical. This next state assignment for the register is a common functionality in digital design to enable sequential processing, and is typically triggered on a clock's rising or falling edge. However, this specific assignment statement implies a combinational circuit, as it does not incorporate clock semantics."
