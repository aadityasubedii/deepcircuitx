    "block_comment": "This block manages the reset operation of a digital system. It is triggered at the rising edge of 'clk' clock signal or 'reset', and guards the previous state of reset ('prev_reset'). If there's a reset actively high, 'prev_reset' is set to logical low immediately overriding any previous value, otherwise 'prev_reset' mirrors the value on 'w_reset'. The logic condition ensures safe operation during reset signal changes."
