Comment: 
This block of code creates a wire `readdata` which takes its value from the 32-bit output of the `read_mux_out` multiplexer. The line of code sets up an assignment operation in which the binary OR operation is performed between a 32-bit zero value and `read_mux_out` and the result is assigned to the `readdata`. This could be used to ensure `readdata` output only changes on changes on the `read_mux_out` multiplexer output. Essentially, the output of the multiplexer is driven onto `readdata` effectively using it as the multiplexer output without changing the lower bits order.
