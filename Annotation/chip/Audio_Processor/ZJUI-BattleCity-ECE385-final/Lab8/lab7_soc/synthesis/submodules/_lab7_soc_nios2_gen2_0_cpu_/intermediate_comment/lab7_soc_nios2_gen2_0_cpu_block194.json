    "block_comment": "The block is a flip flop with an active-low synchronous reset. It is clocked by the positive edge of the 'clk' signal and is reset when 'reset_n' is driven low. When reset, 'R_valid' is asynchronously set to 0. If not in reset, on each rising edge of the clock, 'R_valid' takes the value of 'D_valid'."
