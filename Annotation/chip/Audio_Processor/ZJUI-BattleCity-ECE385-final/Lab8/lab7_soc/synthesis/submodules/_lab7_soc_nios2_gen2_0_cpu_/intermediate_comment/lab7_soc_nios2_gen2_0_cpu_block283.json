    "block_comment": "This block enables an 8-deep FIFO buffer under specific conditions. The buffer is enabled if the write pointer indicates a position of 8 and there's at least one input (\"input_ge1\"), or if there are at least two free spaces (ge2_free) and the incremented write pointer is at position 8 (\"fifo_wrptr_plus1== 4'd8\") along with at least two inputs (\"input_ge2\"), or finally, if there are three free spaces (ge3_free) with the doubly incremented write pointer at position 8 with at least three inputs (\"input_ge3\")."
