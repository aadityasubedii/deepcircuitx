This is a simple digital circuit design block connecting an output port to specific data. The block implements this functionality using the `assign` keyword, which perpetually assigns the value of `data_out` to `out_port` whenever `data_out` changes. This results in the value of `out_port` always being equal to the current value of `data_out`.
