    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning the start and end of packet signals for outgoing data payloads. If a valid condition is met, the code block considers the upper bits of `out_payload` as the information regarding the start and end of the packet. Otherwise, it sets both `out_startofpacket` and `out_endofpacket` to '0', indicating that there is no packet starting or ending. The specific ranges for extracting packet information from `out_payload` are defined by `DATA_WIDTH` and `PACKET_WIDTH` constants."
