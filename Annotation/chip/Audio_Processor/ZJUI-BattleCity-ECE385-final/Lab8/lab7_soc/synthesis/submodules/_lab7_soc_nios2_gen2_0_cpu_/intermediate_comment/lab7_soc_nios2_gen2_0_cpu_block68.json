    "block_comment": "This block is primarily responsible for setting one bit in a control register upon receiving a clock pulse on a positive edge or a reset pulse on the negative edge. Whenever a reset is presented and its value is 0, the control source for immediate 5-bit shift rotation ('R_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot') is forcibly set to 0. If the reset value is not 0 and an enable signal ('R_en') is present, it prepares 'R_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot' for the next input by setting it to 'R_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot_nxt'."
