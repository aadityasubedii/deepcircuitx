    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block is a synchronous flip-flop with active-low asynchronous reset. When the negative edge of the reset signal, 'reset_n', is triggered, the data input 'din_s1' is set to logic high (1). On every positive edge of the clock signal 'clk', if 'reset_n' is not active, 'din_s1' captures and holds the value of data input 'din'. This implementation ensures the flip-flop maintains its state between clock cycles while still allowing for immediate resets."
