This block of code implements a synchronous FIFO memory structure, specifically targeting the fifth element of the system. Upon detecting a rising edge of the clock or a falling edge of the reset signal, the system ensures the reset condition zeroes the fifth element of the FIFO. Otherwise, if the fifth FIFO element is enabled, it takes the value of the output from the multiplexer (fifo_5_mux).
