    "block_comment": "This block is a shift register that operates on the rising edge of a clock signal (clk) or on the falling edge of a reset signal (reset_n). When the reset signal is active (low) it clears the register, setting all bits to 0. When the reset signal is not active, it shifts the current value of the register to the left and captures the signal at 'din_s1' into the least significant bit on the rising edge of the clk signal."
