    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for controlling the byte-enable functionality based on the availability of the clock signal or the status of reset signal. It is implemented using always construct in Verilog where the d_byteenable would be set to 0 when reset is asserted (i.e., reset_n == 0). Conversely, when reset is de-asserted and the clock edge is in the positive phase, the enable signal for byte handling (E_mem_byte_en) is assigned to d_byteenable."
