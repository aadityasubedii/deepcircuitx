The block of code primarily functions to assign the value of `E_control_rd_data` based on the value of `D_iw_control_regnum`. This is facilitated through an implementation utilizing multiple conditional expression (`?:`) operators. These operators query `D_iw_control_regnum` for specific values (ranging from `5'd0` to `5'd5`). Depending on the match, the respective register value (`W_status_reg`, `W_estatus_reg`, `W_bstatus_reg`, etc.) is assigned to `E_control_rd_data`. If none of the conditions match, `W_cdsr_reg` value is assigned as a default case.
