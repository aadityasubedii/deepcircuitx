    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronous logic that responds to positive edges of the clock or negative edges of the reset signal. If the reset signal is active (reset_n == 0), it doesn't perform any operation. However, if the 'i_read' input is high and 'i_waitrequest' input is low, it checks if the exclusive OR of all bits of 'i_readdata' results in an indeterminate value (1'bx). If it does, it will write an error message indicating the timestamp at which 'i_readdata' is 'x', and then halt the operation using the $stop; command. This block serves as an error check mechanism for 'i_readdata'."
