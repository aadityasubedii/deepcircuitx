This block is a conditional signal assignment block for handling packet signals in Verilog. If EMPTY_WIDTH is greater than zero, it bundles start-of-packet, end-of-packet, and empty signals into the in_packet_signals and splits the same signals from out_packet_signals. If EMPTY_WIDTH is not greater than zero, it assigns the in_error signal to out_empty and only handles start-of-packet and end-of-packet signals, ignoring the empty signal. This design uses generate-if construct to conditionally include hardware based on the parameter EMPTY_WIDTH.
