Comment: 
This block represents a synchronous update of a usage flag for a memory structure. The action happens on either a positive edge of the clock or a positive edge of the reset signal. On a reset signal, the binary '0' is assigned to the first bit of the memory usage array thus indicating the memory block is not in use. During normal operation (not a reset), the logic discerns between read and write operations. On write operation, the memory block is marked as used by assigning binary '1' to the first bit of the memory usage array. During a read operation, if there's more than one memory block (DEPTH > 1), current memory usage state is inherited from the next memory block; otherwise, it's cleared indicating the memory block is available for use.
