    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for controlling the 'write' signal based on the clock ('clk') signal and the active-low reset ('jrst_n') signal. It utilizes an always block that is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of 'jrst_n'. On a negative edge of 'jrst_n', the 'write' is cleared to '0', disabling write operations. Otherwise, during a positive edge of the clock, if 'write' is high, 'write' is updated based on the 'waitrequest' signal; otherwise, its next value 'write_nxt' is assigned."
