This block of Verilog code is designed to handle the reset functionality and update the `W_alu_result` in sync with the clock signal. When the active low reset (`reset_n`) signal falls to '0', the code block resets the `W_alu_result` (the result from the ALU in the Write stage) to a default value of '0'. On the positive edge of the clock, if the reset is not active, it simply allows `W_alu_result` to hold the value of `E_alu_result` (the ALU result from the Execute stage), thus, effectively passing the ALU results down the pipeline stages. The code implements a form of sequential logic. This synchronization with the clock's positive edge indicates that this is a rising edge flip-flop design.
