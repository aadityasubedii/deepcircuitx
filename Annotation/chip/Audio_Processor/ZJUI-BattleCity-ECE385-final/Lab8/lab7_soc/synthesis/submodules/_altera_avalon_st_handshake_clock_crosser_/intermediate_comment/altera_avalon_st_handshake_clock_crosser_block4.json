    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is used for the function of assigning a constant value to a signal. Specifically, it sets the 'out_empty' signal to a binary value of '0'. The implementation is achieved through the 'assign' keyword which is used in Verilog to continuously drive a wire with a value. The '1'b0' represents a single bit binary value of 0."
