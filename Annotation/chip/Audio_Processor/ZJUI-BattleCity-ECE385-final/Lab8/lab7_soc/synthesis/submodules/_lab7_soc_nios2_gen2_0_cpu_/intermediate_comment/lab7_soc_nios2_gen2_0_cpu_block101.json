    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to implement a flip-flop that updates the value of the `R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br` signal. Based on the conditions triggered by the rising edge of the clock signal `clk` or the falling edge of the `reset_n` signal, its behavior varies. On the falling edge of the `reset_n` signal, this block of code will reset the `R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br` signal to zero. On the rising edge of the `clk` signal, if the `R_en` signal is enabled, the `R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br` signal will be updated to the next state `R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br_nxt`."
