This code block performs an assignment operation. Its function is to update the state of variables 'reset_out' and 'reset_req'. These states are updated with the current values of the variables 'reset_out_pre' and 'reset_req_pre' respectively. These updating operations are triggered at every change of any of the variables or signals within the always block.
