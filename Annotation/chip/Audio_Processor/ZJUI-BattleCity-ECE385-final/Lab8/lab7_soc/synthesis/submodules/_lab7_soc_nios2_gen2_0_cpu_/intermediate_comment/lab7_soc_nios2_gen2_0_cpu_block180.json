    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block defines the parameter for the file path to the Register File RAM for the NIOS II Gen2 CPU in the SoC design depending on whether the Parameterized Language Interface (PLI) is available or not. If PLI is not supported (`NO_PLI` is defined), the block sets the file path to a .dat file; if PLI is supported (i.e., `NO_PLI` is not defined), it sets the file path to a .hex file. This is done using the Verilog `defparam` statement which allows for the redefinition of parameters of a given module instance."
