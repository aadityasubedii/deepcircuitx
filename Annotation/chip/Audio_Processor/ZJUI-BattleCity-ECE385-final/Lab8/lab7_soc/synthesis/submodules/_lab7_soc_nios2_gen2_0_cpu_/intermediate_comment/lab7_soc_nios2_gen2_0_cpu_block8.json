    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages a control register, R_ctrl_force_src2_zero, that is either reset or updated based on specific clock edge or reset signals. The register is set to 0 on the falling edge of reset (i.e., when reset_n equals 0), effectively resetting the register. Conversely, the register is updated with the value of R_ctrl_force_src2_zero_nxt on the rising edge of the clock, but only when R_en is active (i.e., when R_en equals 1). This suggests that the block serves as a control register update mechanism within a digital system, possibly as part of a state machine, datapath element, or contrologic design."
