    "block_comment": "The block manages trigger states by representing them in two separate wires. The `trigger_state_0` wire is the negation of the `trigger_state`, effectively creating an inverse trigger state. The `trigger_state_1` wire, on the other hand, mirrors the `trigger_state` value directly, serving as an echo of the original trigger state."
