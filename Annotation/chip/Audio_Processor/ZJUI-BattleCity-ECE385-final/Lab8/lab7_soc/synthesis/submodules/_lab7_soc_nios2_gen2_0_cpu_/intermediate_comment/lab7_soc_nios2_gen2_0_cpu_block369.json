    "block_comment": "The presented block of Verilog code manages the request signals for interrupting the processor execution and controls the debug acknowledge signal. It combines the jtag_break, dbrk_break, xbrk_break, and debugreq signals using a logical OR operation to generate the oci_hbreak_req signal. This signal indicates the request to halt the processor execution. The debugack signal, on the other hand, inversely follows the hbreak_enabled signal and is used to acknowledge the reception of a debug request."
