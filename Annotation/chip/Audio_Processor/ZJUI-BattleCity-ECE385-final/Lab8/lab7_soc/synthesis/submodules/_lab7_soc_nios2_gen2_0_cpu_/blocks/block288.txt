Comment: 
This block of code defines a synchronous reset and an enable operation for a register 'fifo_6'. Based on positive edge triggered clock or the negative edge of the asynchronous reset, the block will execute. If the reset 'reset_n' is low (0), the 'fifo_6' register is cleared or reset to zero. And if the enable signal 'fifo_6_enable' is high (1), the value from 'fifo_6_mux' is loaded into 'fifo_6' register.
