    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is used to reset and update a signal under the conditions of a clock edge or reset signal. Specifically, the `za_cannotrefresh` variable is controlled based on the state of the `reset_n` signal and the comparison of `refresh_counter` with 0. If `reset_n` is 0, meaning a reset condition is present, `za_cannotrefresh` is set to 0. If not in a reset state, `za_cannotrefresh` is updated based on the logic AND operation between the condition of `refresh_counter` being 0 and the `refresh_request` signal. This ensures `za_cannotrefresh` is only set under specific timing and refresh conditions."
