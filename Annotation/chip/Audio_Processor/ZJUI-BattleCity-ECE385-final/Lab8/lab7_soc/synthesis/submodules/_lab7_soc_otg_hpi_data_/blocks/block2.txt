Comment: 
This block of code defines a synchronous data output operation in a digital system. Upon the rising edge of the clock or falling edge of the reset signal, the system either resets the output data to zero (if reset_n is LOW), or checks if a chip-selection process is in progress and if a write operation is to be performed at address zero - in such a case, it outputs the lower 16 bits of the input write data onto 'data_out'.
