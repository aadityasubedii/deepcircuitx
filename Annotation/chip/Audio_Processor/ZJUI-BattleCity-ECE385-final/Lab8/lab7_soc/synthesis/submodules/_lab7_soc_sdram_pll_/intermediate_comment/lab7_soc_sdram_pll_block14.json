    "block_comment": "The block of code represents an Altera Phase Locked Loop (PLL) module for a system on chip (SoC) design interfacing with SDRAM. This module takes in a reset signal, a clock signal, and an extra input clock signal array, and outputs a lock signal and a generated clock signal array. Internally, it uses tri-state buffers for reset and input clock signals. It also defines a register `pll_lock_sync` for synchronization for locking mechanism and three wires `wire_pll7_clk`, `wire_pll7_fbout`, and `wire_pll7_locked` which possibly serve as interfacing pins for internal PLL implementation. It also handles certain compiler pragmas to take care of reserved QIS definitions, likely for specific hardware attributes or optimizations."
