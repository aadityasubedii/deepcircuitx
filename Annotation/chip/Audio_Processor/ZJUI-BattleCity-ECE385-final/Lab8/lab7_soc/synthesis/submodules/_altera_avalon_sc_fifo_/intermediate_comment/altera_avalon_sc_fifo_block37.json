    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating the status of a buffer, indicating whether it's full or empty based on read and write conditions. It updates 'next_full' and 'next_empty' flags initially to current full and empty states. When there's a read request and no simultaneous write request, 'next_full' is cleared and 'next_empty' is set if the read pointer equals the write pointer. Alternatively, for a write request without a simultaneous read, 'next_empty' is cleared or set based on the 'drop_on_error' flag and pointers comparision, and 'next_full' is set if write and read pointers match, again contingent on the 'drop_on_error' flag. A simultaneous read and write operation handled only when 'drop_on_error' is set, updates 'next_empty' based on comparison of 'curr_sop_ptr' and 'next_rd_ptr'."
