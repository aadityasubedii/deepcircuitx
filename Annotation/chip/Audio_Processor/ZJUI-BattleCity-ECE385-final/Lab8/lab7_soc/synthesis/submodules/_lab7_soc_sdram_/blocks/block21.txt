The given block performs read operations from either of two registers, entry_0 or entry_1, based upon the read address, rd_address. When rd_address is 0, data from entry_0 is read and when rd_address is 1, data from entry_1 is read. This behavior is achieved using a case statement triggered by any change in entry_0, entry_1, or rd_address. The value of rd_data is updated accordingly, thereby executing a multiplexer-like function.
