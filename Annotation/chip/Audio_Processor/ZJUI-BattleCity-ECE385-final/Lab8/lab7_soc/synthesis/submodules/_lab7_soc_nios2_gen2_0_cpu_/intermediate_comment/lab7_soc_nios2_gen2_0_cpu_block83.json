    "block_comment": "This block handles the control of shifting and rotation operations in a synchronous system. Initiated at the positive edge of the system clock or the negative edge of an asynchronous reset signal, it acts in two conditional scenarios. If the reset signal is inactive, it sets the shift/rotate control register, 'R_ctrl_shift_rot', to zero, essentially clearing its contents. Else, if the enable signal, 'R_en', is high, it updates the shift/rotate control register with the next in line, 'R_ctrl_shift_rot_nxt'."
