    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the \"read\" signal in response to system clock or an active low reset event. If a reset operation is signalled (jrst_n == 0), the \"read\" signal is turned off. However, in the absence of reset, during the system clock's positive edge, the \"read\" signal status is determined by the status of \"waitrequest\", if \"read\" is high; otherwise, it remains unchanged (maintains the status of \"read_nxt\")."
