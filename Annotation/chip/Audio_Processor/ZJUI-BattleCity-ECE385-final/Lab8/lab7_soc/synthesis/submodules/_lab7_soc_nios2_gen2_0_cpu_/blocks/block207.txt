Comment: 
This block of code mainly deals with the control of a particular condition 'wait_for_one_post_bret_inst', based on system reset signal 'reset_n', clock edge 'clk', hardware break signal 'hbreak_enabled' and 'oci_single_step_mode'. If a negative edge is detected on the system reset, 'wait_for_one_post_bret_inst' is cleared to zero. If not, a condition based on hardware break and single step mode signals determines the value of 'wait_for_one_post_bret_inst'. If hardware break is not enabled and single step mode is active, 'wait_for_one_post_bret_inst' is set. Otherwise, its state depends on the validity of 'F_valid' or if the single step mode is inactive, it retains its previous state.
