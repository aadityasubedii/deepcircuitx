Comment: 
The block of code adds a register to the write buffer only if the destination register number is not zero and ignoring the destination register flag (`D_ctrl_ignore_dst`) is not asserted. Specific to implementation, an assignment operation is used to evaluate the right-hand side of `D_wr_dst_reg` where `D_dst_regnum` is compared against zero and the NOT (`~`) of `D_ctrl_ignore_dst`. The bitwise AND operation ensures that `D_wr_dst_reg` is asserted only if both conditions are satisfied.
