    "block_comment": "The given block of code is performing a logical operation. The function of the block is to determine whether the trace functionality is turned off or not, depending on two bits 'trc_ctrl[10]' and 'trc_wrap'. It implements this function by using an assign statement to perform a bitwise logical AND operation on the 11th bit of the 'trc_ctrl' register and the 'trc_wrap' bit and assigns its result to the 'xbrk_wrap_traceoff' wire. If both 'trc_ctrl[10]' and 'trc_wrap' are high (1), 'xbrk_wrap_traceoff' will be high (1); otherwise, it will be low (0)."
