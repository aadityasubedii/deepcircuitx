    "block_comment": "This line of code is defining a wire 'D_ctrl_mem32' and assigning it with a logical OR operation between the four listed operations - 'D_op_ldw', 'D_op_ldwio', 'D_op_stw' and 'D_op_stwio'. This 'D_ctrl_mem32' signal will be high when any of the four listed operations is active. This indicates that a 32-bit memory operation (either a word load or a word store) is being performed either to local data memory or IO memory. This assignment is typically used in digital systems to enable or control specific operations based on certain conditions."
