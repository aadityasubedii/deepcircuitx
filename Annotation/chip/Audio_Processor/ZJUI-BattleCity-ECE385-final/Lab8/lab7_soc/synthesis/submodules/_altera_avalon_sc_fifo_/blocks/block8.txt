Comment: 
This block is used to control packet forwarding and handle various signal assignments under different conditions in a FIFO network environment. When the USE_STORE_FORWARD parameter is enabled, several conditional signals are assigned based on the status of packet handling and FIFO thresholds. Signals like 'wait_for_threshold', 'wait_for_pkt', 'ok_to_forward' are used to control packet processing. Simultaneously, signals like 'in_pkt_eop_arrive', 'in_pkt_start', 'in_pkt_error', 'out_pkt_sop_leave', 'out_pkt_leave', and 'fifo_too_small' are assigned based on the input and output packet status. These signals facilitate packet forwarding, marking the start and end of packets, handling errors, and managing the fullness and readiness of the FIFO pipeline.
