    "block_comment": "This code block is a memory pointer controller operating at the positive edge of a clock signal or a reset signal. If the reset signal is active, it resets the write (wr_ptr) and read (rd_ptr) pointers to zero, essentially initializing the memory. If the system is not in reset state, it updates the values of the write and read pointers to the next values (next_wr_ptr and next_rd_ptr)."
