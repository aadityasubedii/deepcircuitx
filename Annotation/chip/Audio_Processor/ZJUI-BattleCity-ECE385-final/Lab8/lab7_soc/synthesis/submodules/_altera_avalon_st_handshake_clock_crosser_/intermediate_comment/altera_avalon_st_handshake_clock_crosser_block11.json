    "block_comment": "The code block assigns the output data value. Specifically, it implements a part-select operation where out_data is assigned the sub-array of bits in the bit-vector out_payload from index '0' to 'DATA_WIDTH - 1'. This means out_data is equivalent to the least significant bits of the out_payload array from 0th index up to (DATA_WIDTH - 1)th index."
