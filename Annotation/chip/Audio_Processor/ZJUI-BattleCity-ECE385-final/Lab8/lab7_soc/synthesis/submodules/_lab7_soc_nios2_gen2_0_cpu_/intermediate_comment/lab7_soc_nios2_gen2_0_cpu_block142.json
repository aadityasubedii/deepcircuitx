    "block_comment": "This block of code is a flip-flop circuit that handles the logic for the write enable (W_ienable_reg) register. The condition of the write enable register resets on a falling edge of reset_n, else it updates its value with W_ienable_reg_nxt at every rising edge of the clock (clk). The use of always @(posedge clk or negedge reset_n) indicates this."
