Comment: 
This line of code assigns the next state of the control signal `R_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot` the current state of `D_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot`. The assignment operation is facilitated through the 'assign' keyword in Verilog, which establishes continuous assignments. The semantics of the code infers a digital circuit where, the `R_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot_nxt` signal varies as per the current state of the `D_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot` signal.
