    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for the conditional execution of data assignment in a synchronous digital system. The execution is contingent on the state of the 'clk' and 'reset_n' signals, with the 'clk' signal being a positive edge-triggered. For the case where 'reset_n' is LOW, the block sets the 'za_data' register to zero, effectively performing a reset operation. Conversely, when 'reset_n' is HIGH, the register 'za_data' is updated with the value present at 'zs_dq'."
