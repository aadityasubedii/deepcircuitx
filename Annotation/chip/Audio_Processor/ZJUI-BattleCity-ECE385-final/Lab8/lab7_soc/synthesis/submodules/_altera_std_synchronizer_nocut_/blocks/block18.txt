This block of code checks if the depth of a synchronizer is less than 2. Implemented in the initial begin-end block in Verilog, it's executed at the start of the simulation. If the condition is true, i.e., the depth of the synchronizer is less than 2, an error message is displayed, indicating that the synchronizer length is less than 2.
