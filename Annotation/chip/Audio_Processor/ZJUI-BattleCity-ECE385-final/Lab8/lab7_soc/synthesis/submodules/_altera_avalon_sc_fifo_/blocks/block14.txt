This block of code serves as a control and status register (CSR) for managing certain parameters of a FIFO module on a posedge clock or posedge reset event. On a reset event, it initializes the parameters to their default states. If a CSR read request is made, the code checks the CSR address and populates the csr_readdata with the requested parameter's value. In case of a CSR write request, it checks the CSR address and updates the corresponding parameter based on the incoming csr_writedata.
