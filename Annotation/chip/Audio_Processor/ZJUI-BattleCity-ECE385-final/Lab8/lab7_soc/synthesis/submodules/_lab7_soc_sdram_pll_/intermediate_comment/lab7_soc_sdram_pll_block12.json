    "block_comment": "This block of code designs a synchronous reset functionality for a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) circuit. It is sensitive to the positive edge of the 'wire_pll7_locked' signal or the 'areset' signal. In the event of an asynchronous reset ('areset' is HIGH), the PLL lock signal ('pll_lock_sync') is set to LOW, essentially resetting it. If the asynchronous reset is not asserted, 'pll_lock_sync' is set to HIGH, indicating that the PLL is locked and synchronized."
