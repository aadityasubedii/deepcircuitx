    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling shift and rotation operations [Function of the block]. The block employs a combinational logic design, `assign`, which assigns the logical OR output of various operation flags (SLLI, SLL, ROLI, ROL, SRLI, SRL, SRAI, SRA, ROR) to a master control flag `D_ctrl_shift_rot`. This master flag `D_ctrl_shift_rot` thus becomes true if any or multiple shift/rotate operations are required by setting their respective flags [Implementation details of the block]."
