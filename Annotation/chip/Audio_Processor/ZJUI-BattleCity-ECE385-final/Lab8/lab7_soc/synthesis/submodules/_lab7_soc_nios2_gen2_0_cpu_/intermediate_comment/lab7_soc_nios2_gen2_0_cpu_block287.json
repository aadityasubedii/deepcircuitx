    "block_comment": "This code block primarily functions as a complex multiplexer or selector that selectively assigns to 'fifo_6_mux' based on several conditions. The implementation employs compound condition checks using the \"assign\" keyword and the ternary operator (?:). These checks involve variables like fifo_wrptr, fifo_wrptr_plus1, ge2_free and validation flags (itm_valid, atm_valid, dtm_valid). The output is set to either itm or two types of pending overflow signals, namely overflow_pending_atm and overflow_pending_dtm. The exact output depends on the specific condition that holds true. If no condition is valid, the output defaults to overflow_pending_dtm."
