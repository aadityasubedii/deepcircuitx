The block ensures synchronization of the input data stream by double buffering and preventing data changes during processing. It draws from a clock or reset signal and uses an 'if-else' control structure for signal management. On receiving a reset signal, the data buffer is initialized to zero, and data toggle state is set to zero. Else, on existence of 'take_in_data' (a control flag), the data toggle state is inverted for double buffering, and the buffer is allocated the input data for processing.
