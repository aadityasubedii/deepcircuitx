    "block_comment": "This is a simple Verilog initialization block that sets the value of the 'pfdena_reg' register. Inside the block, the register 'pfdena_reg' is initialized to max value by using a 1-bit binary value of 1, which is replicated for the full width of the register. This operation happens at the beginning of the simulation time and ensures that the 'pfdena_reg' is enabled from the start."
