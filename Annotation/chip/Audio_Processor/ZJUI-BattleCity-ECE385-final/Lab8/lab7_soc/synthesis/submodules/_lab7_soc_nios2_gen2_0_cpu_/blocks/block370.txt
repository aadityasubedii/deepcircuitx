This block controls the status of three monitor variables, which are monitor_ready, monitor_error, and monitor_go. Taking the clock signal to initiate the control, the block first checks for a negedge trigger from the jrst_n reset variable. In case of a reset (jrst_n == 0), it sets all three monitor variables to 0. Otherwise, it updates the monitor variables based on a set of conditions. For instance, the monitor_ready variable will only be '1' if the take_action_ocireg signal and ocireg_mrs flag are both True, while the monitor_error will be '1' only when the same take_action_ocireg signal plus an ocireg_ers flag are True. Similarly, the monitor_go is updated to '1' on the condition of take_action_ocimem_a signal and jdo[23] flag being True.
