    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `D_ctrl_br_cmp` as a logical OR operation of various operation types. The block carries out the functionality of checking if any branch operation is happening and signals downstream whether to execute comparison operation or not. The Boolean pipe (|) denotes the logical OR operation, and the result of this line of code will be 1 if any of the variables to the right of the equals sign is 1, otherwise it will be 0. The assignment operation here is primarily about evaluating different branching conditions in a pipeline stage, specifically the Decode Stage, often labelled as 'D' in RISC-V pipeline implementations."
