    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a synchronous reset and an asynchronous register update mechanism in Verilog. The reset process occurs at the negative edge of the reset_n signal, resetting the oci_single_step_mode to low. Meanwhile, the register update occurs at the positive edge of the clock, where the oci_single_step_mode is set to the value of ocireg_sstep if the take_action_ocireg condition is met."
