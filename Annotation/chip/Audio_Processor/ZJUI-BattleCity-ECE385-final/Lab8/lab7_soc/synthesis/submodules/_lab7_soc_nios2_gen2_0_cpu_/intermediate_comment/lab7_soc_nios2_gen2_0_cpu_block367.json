    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code declares a module called 'lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_nios2_oci_break'. It serves as a point of interaction for various components related to debugging and instruction break within a Nios II CPU system. Mainly, this module takes in signals related to instruction breakpoints, debug breakpoints, jump directives, and trigger states. A part of the system-on-chip (SoC) setup, this module manages the handling and direction of these signals within the system, helping orchestrate an integrated response. It achieves this through the interaction of the module with 'break_readreg', 'dbrk_hit' latches, 'trigbrktype', 'trigger_state', and 'xbrk_ctrl' signals. These signals together form a complex network which helps facilitate functional system-level debugging in the CPU."
