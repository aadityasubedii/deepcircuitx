Comment: 
The block handles resetting and updating of the 'av_ld_aligning_data' register. Operating synchronously with the system's rising edge clock cycle, the block resets the 'av_ld_aligning_data' register to zero when 'reset_n' signal is extricated (0). In absence of the reset signal (otherwise), it updates the 'av_ld_aligning_data' to its next value as defined by 'av_ld_aligning_data_nxt'.
