    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code initializes a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) lock synchronization signal. Specifically, it sets the 'pll_lock_sync' signal to 0. This initialization is crucial for the initial state of the digital system, as it provides a definite starting point for the lock synchronization process in a circuit that uses a Phase-Locked Loop for frequency synchronization."
