This block of code represents a synchronous reset mechanism for a control load register. It is designed to operate with both the rising edge of a clock signal (`clk`) and the falling edge of an asynchronous reset signal (`reset_n`). When the reset signal is active (in this case, logic `0`), the control load register (`R_ctrl_ld`) is forcibly set to `0` regardless of the clock signal state, thus achieving the reset action. If the reset signal is not active (logic `1`) and the `R_en` enable signal is true, the `R_ctrl_ld` register captures the next control load input (`R_ctrl_ld_nxt`) on the rising edge of the clock signal.
