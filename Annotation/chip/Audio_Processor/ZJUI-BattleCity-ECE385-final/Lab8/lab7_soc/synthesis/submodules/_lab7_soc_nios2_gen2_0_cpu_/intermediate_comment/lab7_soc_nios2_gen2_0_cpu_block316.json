    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a module in Verilog that increments a write pointer for a FIFO buffer in a Nios2 system on a chip. The functionality of the module relies on input signals, `ge2_free` and `ge3_free`, and a count input `input_tm_cnt`. These signals are then used to control the incrementation of `fifo_wrptr_inc`. The write pointer (`fifo_wrptr_inc`) is represented as a 4-bit register, allowing for 16 different positions in the FIFO buffer. The `ge2_free` and `ge3_free` determine when the pointer can be incremented, as they represent free spaces in the FIFO."
