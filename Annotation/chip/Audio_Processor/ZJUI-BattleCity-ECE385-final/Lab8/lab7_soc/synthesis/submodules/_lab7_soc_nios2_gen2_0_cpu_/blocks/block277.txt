The block functions as a synchronous reset logic to control the status of a FIFO queue. The operation of the FIFO queue is governed by the signal 'clk'. When 'reset_n' signal is 0, the FIFO named 'fifo_10' is reset, essentially clearing the content of the queue. In other scenarios, when 'fifo_10_enable' is active or 1, the value of 'fifo_10' is updated from 'fifo_10_mux', acting as data load functionality. The entire logic is applied at the rising edge of the 'clk' or at the falling edge of the 'reset_n' signal.
