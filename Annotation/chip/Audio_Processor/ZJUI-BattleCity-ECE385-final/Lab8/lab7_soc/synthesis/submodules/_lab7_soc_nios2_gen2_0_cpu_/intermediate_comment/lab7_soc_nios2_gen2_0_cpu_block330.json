    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes various control and status signals in a system. Most of the signals are assigned a default value of 0, implying a reset or idle situation. For instance, operation signals like 'is_cond_dct', 'is_dct', 'dct_is_taken', 'is_idct', and other status and control signals are set to 0. Moreover, it defines 'sync_interval' and 'sync_timer_next' utilizing simple logic and arithmetic operations refrencing other signals including 'sync_code' and 'sync_timer'. Conditions leading towards the recording of 'dct_outcome_in_sync' and 'record_itrace' are also defined. The 'dct_code' and 'itm' are further initialized based on existing signals."
