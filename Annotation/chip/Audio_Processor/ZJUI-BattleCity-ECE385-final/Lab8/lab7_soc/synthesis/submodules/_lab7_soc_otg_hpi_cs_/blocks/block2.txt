This block implements a register with synchronous reset and write functionality. Upon a falling edge of the reset signal (reset_n), the register 'data_out' is reset to zero. On each rising edge of the clock, if the 'chipselect' is enabled, a write command is active (with an assertion of the inverted 'write_n' signal), and the target 'address' equals 0, the data from the 'writedata' bus is written into the 'data_out' register.
