    "block_comment": "This block of code performs control for the signal `E_xbrk_traceoff` based on system reset and CPU address enable conditions. On encountering a negative edge reset, `E_xbrk_traceoff` is set to 0. If reset doesn't occur and CPU address is enabled, `E_xbrk_traceoff` takes the value of `xbrk_toff_hit`. This block essentially uses a flip-flop to hold the value for `E_xbrk_traceoff`, ensuring its value remains stable across other clock cycles."
