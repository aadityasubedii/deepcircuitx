It communicates via the JTAG interface to assist in the debugging process, manipulating and reading system statuses indicated by input signals. The module uses several shift registers (sr) to select, store, and output data based upon the JTAG instruction received (IR). Input signals involve information about breakpoints, monitor readiness, tracing memory, etc., which would aid an external debugger connected through the JTAG interface. Furthermore, it includes synchronizers to avoid metastable conditions from asynchronous inputs such as debug acknowledgment and monitor readiness. Conversely, it outputs information about JTAG state, Instruction Register (IR), Shift Register (SR), and some status signals."
