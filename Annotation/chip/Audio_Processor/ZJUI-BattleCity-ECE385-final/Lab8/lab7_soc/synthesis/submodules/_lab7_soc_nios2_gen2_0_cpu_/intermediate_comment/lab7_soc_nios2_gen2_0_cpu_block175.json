    "block_comment": "This block controls the operation of a resetable register E_src2 in sync with a clock signal. Upon the negative edge (falling) of the reset signal `reset_n`, the value of E_src2 is set to 0 and thus the reset operation is performed. Meanwhile, on the positive edge (rising) of the clock signal `clk` when `reset_n` is not 0, the register E_src2 is updated with the value of R_src2. The block essentially implements synchronous behavior for a register with reset capability."
