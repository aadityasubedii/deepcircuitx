    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog represents the declaration of a module which is the `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu`. The function of this block is to establish the various signals which are associated with the specified CPU module. All of these signals represent different data bus inputs, outputs, or control signals that the CPU module will interface with. They include signals for clock (clk), read data (d_readdata and i_readdata), write data (d_writedata), address designation (d_address and i_address), and several interface signals for debugging and interrupt requests."
