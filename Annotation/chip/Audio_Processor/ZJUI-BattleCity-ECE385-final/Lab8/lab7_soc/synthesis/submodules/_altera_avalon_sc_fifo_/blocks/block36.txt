Comment: 
This block of code is used for managing control signals in synchronous systems, specifically to control when a data structure, like a FIFO or memory, is flagged as empty or full. During a reset or on the rising edge of the clock, it checks if reset is active or not. If the reset is active, it sets the flags 'empty' to 1 and 'full' to 0, initializing the state implying structure is empty and not full. Otherwise, in the normal operation (when the clock rises), it updates the 'empty' and 'full' flags based on the 'next_empty' and 'next_full' signals, which are probably calculated elsewhere based on the data structure's current state.
