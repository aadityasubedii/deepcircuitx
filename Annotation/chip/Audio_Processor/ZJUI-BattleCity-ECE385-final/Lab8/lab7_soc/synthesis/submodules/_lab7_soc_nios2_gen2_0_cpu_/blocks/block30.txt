This block is responsible for controlling the memory 'R_ctrl_mem16' with use of a clock-edge (both positive and negative) triggered logic. It relies on two control signals: the negative reset 'reset_n' and the enable signal 'R_en'. When the reset is active (low), the memory is cleared (forced to '0'); and when the block is enabled by 'R_en', the next value (stored in 'R_ctrl_mem16_nxt') is loaded into 'R_ctrl_mem16'.
