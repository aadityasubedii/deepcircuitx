    "block_comment": "This block of code generates the next input data for stage 1 processing. It checks if the current data input (`din`) is different from the last data input (`din_last`) using the XOR operator. If there is a difference, it assigns a random number to the `next_din_s1`, otherwise, it assigns the current data input to `next_din_s1`. This block of the code uses conditional (ternary) operator to perform this function. Thus, it essentially creates variations in the input stream with some randomness when a change in data input is detected."
