    "block_comment": "The provided block of code represents a synchronous process that manages an interrupt signal ('pause_irq') based on various conditions. Triggered at the positive edge of the clock 'clk' or the negative edge of the reset signal 'rst_n', this block uses conditional statements to set the value of 'pause_irq'. Firstly, when the reset is active (low), it clears 'pause_irq'. However, when 't_pause' is true and the FIFO buffer is not empty (indicated by '~fifo_EF'), it sets 'pause_irq' high, signalling a pause interrupt. Finally, if a 'read_0' event occurs, it clears 'pause_irq'. The use of the always block, along with the posedge and negedge qualifiers, specify the sensitivity list of this sequential logic circuit, making it behave like a flip-flop component."
