    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a Reset Synchronizer. Its function is to properly synchronize a reset signal with the system clock to prevent glitches or metastability in the input reset signal. If a reset signal is asserted, the reset synchronizer sets all the elements in the internal reset synchronizer chain to high ('1'). If the reset signal is not asserted, it shifts all bits in the chain to the right, inserts '0' at the most significant bit, and outputs the least significant bit."
