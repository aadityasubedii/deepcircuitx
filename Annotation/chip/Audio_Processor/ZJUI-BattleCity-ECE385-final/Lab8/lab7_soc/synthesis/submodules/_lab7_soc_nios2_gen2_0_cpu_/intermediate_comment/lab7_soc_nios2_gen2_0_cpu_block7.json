    "block_comment": "This block controls the ALU's (Arithmetic Logic Unit) XOR function. The XOR operation is a logical function that's often used for comparisons and conditional branching in computation. This block uses a series of bitwise OR operations to collectively assign the resulting value to the control signal 'D_ctrl_alu_force_xor'. If any of the provided operands ('D_op_cmpgei', 'D_op_cmpgeui', 'D_op_cmpeqi', 'D_op_cmpge', 'D_op_cmpgeu', 'D_op_cmpeq', 'D_op_cmpnei', 'D_op_cmpne', 'D_op_bge', 'D_op_bgeu', 'D_op_beq', 'D_op_bne', 'D_op_br') is true, the XOR function in the ALU is activated. This design configuration allows for versatile operation of the ALU depending on various input conditions."
