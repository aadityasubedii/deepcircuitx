    "block_comment": "This block manages the control return address register ('R_ctrl_retaddr') in a synchronous digital system. During a negative edge of 'reset_n', the register is reset to '0'. When the system isn't being reset, as long as the enable signal ('R_en') is high at the positive edge of the clock, 'R_ctrl_retaddr' is updated to the value of 'R_ctrl_retaddr_nxt', effectively pointing to the next return address."
