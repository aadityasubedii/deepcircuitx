    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for triggering an error message if the value of `F_valid` becomes indeterminate ('x'). The block is activated upon the rising edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`). Where it checks if the `reset_n` flag is not low. If it's not, and the bitwise XOR reduction of `F_valid` is indeterminate ('x'), it prints an error message showing the current simulation time and the issue about `F_valid` having an 'x' value, and then stops further simulation escalation."
