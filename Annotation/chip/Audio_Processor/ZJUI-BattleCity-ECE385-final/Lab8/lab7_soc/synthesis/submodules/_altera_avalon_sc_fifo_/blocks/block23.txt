Comment: 
The block manages the counter tracking the length of the current packet. Upon a rising edge of either reset or clock signal, it checks whether a reset is triggered or data writing is in process. For reset, the counter 'curr_packet_len_less_one' is set back to zero. If data is being written, the counter incrementally increases, and zeros out when the end of packet is detected.
