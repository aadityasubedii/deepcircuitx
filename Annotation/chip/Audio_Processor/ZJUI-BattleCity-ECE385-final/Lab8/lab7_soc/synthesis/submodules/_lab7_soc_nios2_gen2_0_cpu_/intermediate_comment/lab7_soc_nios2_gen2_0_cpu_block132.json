    "block_comment": "The block of code is designed to handle the reset and write cycle of the 'd_write' signal in the design. It operates synchronously with respect to the positive edge of the clock 'clk' or the negative edge of the reset signal 'reset_n'. If the 'reset_n' signal is active (i.e., '0'), the 'd_write' signal is set to '0'. Otherwise, in the case of a clock event, the next value 'd_write_nxt' is assigned to 'd_write', effectively implementing a clocked save operation or write cycle for the 'd_write' signal."
