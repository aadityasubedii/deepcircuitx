Module-level comment: The altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser module provides an interface for transferring data across different clock domains, safeguarding against glitches or metastability. It utilizes input/output ports for receiving/sending data, and internal signals to manage data synchronization. The synchronization mechanism utilizes altera_std_synchronizer_nocut modules for forward and backward synchronization. Depending on the parameters set, an output pipeline method or direct assignment is utilized for data delivery.
