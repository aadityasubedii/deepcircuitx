    "block_comment": "The block is used for conditional code generation based on the value of 'rst_value'. If the 'rst_value' equals to '1', the subsequent code within the 'if' construct will be generated. The purpose of this code is to provide a means of creating hardware-level conditional operations, which may potentially reduce unnecessary hardware usage or optimize for specific conditions. It's an important component of hardware description language like Verilog, offering flexibility in hardware design."
