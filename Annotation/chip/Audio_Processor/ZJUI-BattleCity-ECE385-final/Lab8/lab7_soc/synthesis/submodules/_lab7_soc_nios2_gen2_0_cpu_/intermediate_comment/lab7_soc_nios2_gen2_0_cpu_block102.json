    "block_comment": "This block of code handles control transfer instructions (CTIs) that are unconditional and non-branching in a digital system. It utilizes bitwise OR operators to assign the result of multiple operations to the signal 'D_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br'. This operation combines various flags like 'D_op_call', 'D_op_jmpi', 'D_op_eret', 'D_op_bret', 'D_op_ret', 'D_op_jmp', and 'D_op_callr', representing different types of control transfer instructions. In the next line, the current state of 'D_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br' is assigned to 'R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br_nxt' to maintain the system's state for the next cycle."
