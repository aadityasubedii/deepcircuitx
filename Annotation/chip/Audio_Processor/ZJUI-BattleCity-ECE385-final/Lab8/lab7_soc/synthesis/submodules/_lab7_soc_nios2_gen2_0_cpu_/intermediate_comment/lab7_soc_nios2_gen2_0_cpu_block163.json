    "block_comment": "This block is a flip-flop with asynchronous reset control to handle data read operations in a synchronous digital design. When a negative edge on reset_n is detected, d_read is asynchronously cleared to 0. Conversely, at the positive edge of the clock signal, the value of d_read is updated to the next predetermined value (d_read_nxt) if reset_n is not active. This leverages the clock signal for synchronization, ensuring reliable timing and functioning of the digital system."
