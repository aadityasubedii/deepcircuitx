Module-level comment: This Verilog module, altera_avalon_st_handshake_clock_crosser, safely manages data transfer across different clock domains for Altera Avalon Streaming (ST) interfaces. It forms an input payload encapsulating input data and associated parameters. This payload is then transferred via a clock crosser module to the output domain where it is appropriately separated. This modular and flexible approach, achieved through parameterization, ensures safe and coherent clock-domain crossings for various data configurations.
