    "block_comment": "This block controls the value of the D_valid signal in a sequential design of a digital circuit. On every positive edge of the clock signal or on a negative edge of the reset_n signal, the block checks whether reset_n is set to 0 - if it is, the D_valid signal is immediately set to 0, indicating a reset. However, if the reset_n signal is not 0, the D_valid signal is updated on the clock's positive edge to reflect either the F_valid status or the status of W1_rf_ecc_recoverable_valid, which is likely an error-checking signal. The \"|\" operator indicates that if either of these signals are valid, the D_valid signal will be set to valid as well."
