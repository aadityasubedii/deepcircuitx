    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code is minimally assigning functionality to certain signals within the system. Specifically, the clock signal of the debug memory slave is directly tied to the primary system clock. The reset signal for the debug memory slave is an inverted form of the primary system reset signal, ensuring that the debug memory slave's reset occurs when the system is not in a reset state. The line \"assign D_ctrl_custom = 1'b0;\" assigns the D_ctrl_custom signal a permanent value of '0', potentially being used as a standard or default assignment within the system."
