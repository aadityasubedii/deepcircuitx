    "block_comment": "The block assigns the next state value for the control signal `R_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm_nxt`, which largely determines if the source 2 operand for the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) should be derived from register or immediate data. It does this by simply forwarding the current state value of `D_ctrl_set_src2_rem_imm`, which means that it's implicit that the direction of operation or the source of operand does not change in the next cycle."
