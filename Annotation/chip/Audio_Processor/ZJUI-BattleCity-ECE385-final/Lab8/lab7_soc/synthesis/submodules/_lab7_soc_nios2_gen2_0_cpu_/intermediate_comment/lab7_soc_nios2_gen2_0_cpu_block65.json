    "block_comment": "The block of code governs the control of the unconditional branch register (R_ctrl_br_uncond) in response to clock or reset signals. The register is reset upon receiving a negative edge reset signal (reset_n == 0). If no reset signal is received and an enable signal (R_en) is triggered with the positive edge of the clock cycle, the register value gets updated to the next state value (R_ctrl_br_uncond_nxt)."
