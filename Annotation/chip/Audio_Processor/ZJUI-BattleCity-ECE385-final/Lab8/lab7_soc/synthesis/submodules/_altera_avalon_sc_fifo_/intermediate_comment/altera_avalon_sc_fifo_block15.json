    "block_comment": "The block of code is an optional feature gate for setting the maximum FIFO size. If the USE_STORE_FORWARD constant is true, then this code is executed, and `max_fifo_size` is assigned the value of `FIFO_DEPTH - 1`. This represents the highest index value into the FIFO buffer that can be occupied, as it is typically zero-indexed. The feature is implemented using a generate-if construct in Verilog, which enables conditional synthesis."
