    "block_comment": "This module, `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_nios2_oci_compute_input_tm_cnt`, seems to compute and control the number of valid inputs (`atm_valid`, `dtm_valid`, `itm_valid`). These valid inputs are likely connected to different modules or parts of the system. The computed value is returned as `compute_input_tm_cnt`. Without more context, it's hard to be specific about the implementation, but it's likely to iterate over or conduct a logical operation on the input flags to compute the output."
