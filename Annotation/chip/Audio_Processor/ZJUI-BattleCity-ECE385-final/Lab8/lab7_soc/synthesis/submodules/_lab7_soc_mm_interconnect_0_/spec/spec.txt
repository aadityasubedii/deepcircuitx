Module name: lab7_soc_mm_interconnect_0. Module specification: This module serves as an interconnect component for a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, facilitating communication between various components such as the NIOS II processor, SDRAM, JTAG UART, and other peripherals. It has numerous input and output ports for clock signals, reset signals, addresses, data, and control signals from different SoC components. The module contains internal signals for routing, demultiplexing, multiplexing, and clock domain crossing, including routers, command demuxes, response muxes, and Avalon streaming adapters. The code is structured into several sections, including port declarations, internal signal declarations, and instantiations of sub-modules for routing and data transfer. The interconnect handles complex routing logic, implements the Avalon interface protocol, and manages data transfer between components potentially operating
