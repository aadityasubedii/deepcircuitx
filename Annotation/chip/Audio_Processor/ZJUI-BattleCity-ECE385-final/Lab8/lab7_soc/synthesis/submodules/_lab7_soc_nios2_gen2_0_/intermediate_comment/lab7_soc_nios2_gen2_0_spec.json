    "spec": "Module name: lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0. \n\nModule specification:\n\nThe module `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0` acts as an interface and a wrapper for the actual CPU instance implemented by `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu`. The main function of this module is to direct and route the input/output connections from the main module (lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0) to `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu`. \n\nThe input ports include clock (clk), system reset signals (reset_n and reset_req), data read (d_readdata and d_waitrequest), instruction read (i_readdata and i_waitrequest), interrupt request (irq), and a range of debug access signals (debug_mem_slave_address, debug_mem_slave_byteenable, debug_mem_slave_debugaccess, debug_mem_slave_read, debug_mem_slave_writedata, debug_mem_slave_write). \n\nThe output ports include data and instruction-related addresses (d_address and i_address), byte-lane control signals for data (d_byteenable), read requests (d_read and i_read), write requests (d_write), data to write (d_writedata), debug memory signals (debug_mem_slave_debugaccess_to_roms, debug_reset_request, debug_mem_slave_readdata, debug_mem_slave_waitrequest), and a dummy carry-in port (dummy_ci_port).\n\nThe block structure of the code is very simple, as it primarily includes a single instance of the `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu` module. This instance maps the input and output ports of `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0` to the corresponding ports of the `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu`. This mapping creates a direct interface between the main module and the CPU instance.\n\nThe module doesn't declare or use any internal signals. All the signals appearing in the module are either input or output ports interconnected with the `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu` instance.\n\nThis module appears to be a key element in a larger System on Chip (SoC) design, which contains a Nios II processor, and it forms a part of overall system integration, routing signals for various operations like memory reads/writes, interrupt handling, and debug operations from and to the CPU subsystem.",

The main function of this module is to direct and route the input/output connections from the main module (lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0) to `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu`. \n\nThe input ports include clock (clk), system reset signals (reset_n and reset_req), data read (d_readdata and d_waitrequest), instruction read (i_readdata and i_waitrequest), interrupt request (irq), and a range of debug access signals (debug_mem_slave_address, debug_mem_slave_byteenable, debug_mem_slave_debugaccess, debug_mem_slave_read, debug_mem_slave_writedata, debug_mem_slave_write). \n\nThe output ports include data and instruction-related addresses (d_address and i_address), byte-lane control signals for data (d_byteenable), read requests (d_read and i_read), write requests (d_write), data to write (d_writedata), debug memory signals (debug_mem_slave_debugaccess_to_roms, debug_reset_request, debug_mem_slave_readdata, debug_mem_slave_waitrequest), and a dummy carry-in port (dummy_ci_port).\n\nThe block structure of the code is very simple, as it primarily includes a single instance of the `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu` module. This instance maps the input and output ports of `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0` to the corresponding ports of the `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu`. This mapping creates a direct interface between the main module and the CPU instance.\n\nThe module doesn't declare or use any internal signals. All the signals appearing in the module are either input or output ports interconnected with the `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu` instance.\n\nThis module appears to be a key element in a larger System on Chip (SoC) design, which contains a Nios II processor, and it forms a part of overall system integration, routing signals for various operations like memory reads/writes, interrupt handling, and debug operations from and to the CPU subsystem."
