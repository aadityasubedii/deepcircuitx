    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of `m_cmd` to `cmd_all`. It is a simple assignment statement performed without any conditional checks or computations. This means that the value of `m_cmd` will directly reflect on `cmd_all`. The assignment is performed concurrently or in parallel, which is inherent to hardware description language like Verilog."
