Comment: 
The block governs the validity of an internal output signal within a design. Based on the rising edge of a clock signal or a positive reset signal, the block resets the 'internal_out_valid' signal if the reset is true, otherwise, it checks for the 'empty' status, permission to forward ('ok_to_forward') and whether there is an 'error'. If 'read' is enabled, it further checks if the 'incremented_rd_ptr' equals the 'wr_ptr', and sets 'internal_out_valid' to false if they are equal.
