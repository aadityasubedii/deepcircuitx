    "block_comment": "This code block is used to signal when the receiving hardware module is ready for new data. It utilizes a negated flag, full, to indicate readiness. Therefore, if the full signal is low (0), it means that the module is not full and is ready to receive new data (in_ready is high (1)), but if the full signal is high (1), it means that the module is full and not ready for new data (in_ready is low (0))."
