    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is basically used for generating a boolean 'xbrk3_armed' based on some control and state conditions. Specifically, it sets 'xbrk3_armed' as high if the fifth bitn of 'xbrk_ctrl3' is high (indicating that the control for xbreak3 is enabled) and 'trigger_state_0' is high, or if there exists any previous condition that has set 'xbrk3_armed' as high.\n"
