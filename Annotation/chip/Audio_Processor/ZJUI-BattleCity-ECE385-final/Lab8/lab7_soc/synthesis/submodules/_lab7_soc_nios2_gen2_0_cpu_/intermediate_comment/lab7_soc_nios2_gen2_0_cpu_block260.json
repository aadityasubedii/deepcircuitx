    "block_comment": "The block of code is used for performing bitwise operations on 'input_tm_cnt' and for assigning extended versions of 'overflow_pending' combined with slices of 'atm' and 'dtm'. The bitwise OR operation is performed on 'input_tm_cnt' for 'input_ge1', its second bit is assigned to 'input_ge2' and the bitwise AND operation is performed on 'input_tm_cnt' for 'input_ge3'. The 'overflow_pending' is extended and concatenated with a 35-bits slice from 'atm' and 'dtm' to form 'overflow_pending_atm' and 'overflow_pending_dtm' respectively."
