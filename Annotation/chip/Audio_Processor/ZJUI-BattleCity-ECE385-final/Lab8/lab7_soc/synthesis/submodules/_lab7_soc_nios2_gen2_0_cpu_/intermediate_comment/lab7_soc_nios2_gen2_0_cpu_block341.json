    "block_comment": "This block assigns a boolean value to the signal `xbrk2_armed` based on the status of `xbrk_ctrl2` and `trigger_state` signals. It specifically checks the 4th and 5th bit of the `xbrk_ctrl2` vector, combining their values with those of `trigger_state_0` and `trigger_state_1`, respectively, using bitwise AND operations. The results are then combined via a logical OR operation, with the final outcome being assigned to `xbrk2_armed`."
