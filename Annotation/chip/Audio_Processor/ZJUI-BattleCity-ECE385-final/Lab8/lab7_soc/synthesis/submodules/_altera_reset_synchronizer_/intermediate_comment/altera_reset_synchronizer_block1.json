    "block_comment": "I'm afraid the block of Verilog code provided is incomplete. All I see is two \"end\" statements without any context or corresponding starting statements. In Verilog, \"end\" is used to mark the closing of several different constructs such as always, initial, module, generate and more. In this case, the \"end\" appears after \"endgenerate\" so it suggests a generate loop or an if generate statement but I need the complete code in order to provide a detailed summary. Please provide a full block of code."
