    "block_comment": "This code block in Verilog describes a synchronous register (dreg) which can also be cleared asynchronously. The register dreg gets reset asynchronously when a negative edge of reset_n (typically, activelow reset signal) is detected - at such an instance, all bits of the register are set to 1. However, during a positive edge of clock (clk), dreg simply latches the input data (din_s1). Thus, this block of code is a digital circuit descriptor for an asynchronous reset and synchronous set operation on a hardware register."
