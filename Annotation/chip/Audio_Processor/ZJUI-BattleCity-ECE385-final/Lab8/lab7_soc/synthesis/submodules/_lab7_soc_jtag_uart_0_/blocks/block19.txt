The block of code captures the functionality of a write operation in a FIFO buffer. It writes a new value into the FIFO buffer each time a rising edge of the clock signal is detected, provided the fifo_wr condition is satisfied. The data written into the buffer, fifo_wdata, is formatted as a character for storage.
