    "block_comment": "This block acts as a storage component, specifically, a flip-flop for the control branch comparison value (`R_ctrl_br_cmp`). In its implementation, the block checks for a rising edge of the clock (`clk`) or a falling edge of `reset_n`. If `reset_n` is in a low state, the block sets `R_ctrl_br_cmp` to zero for reset operations. Otherwise, if `R_en` is enabled, it loads the next value of `R_ctrl_br_cmp` from `R_ctrl_br_cmp_nxt`."
