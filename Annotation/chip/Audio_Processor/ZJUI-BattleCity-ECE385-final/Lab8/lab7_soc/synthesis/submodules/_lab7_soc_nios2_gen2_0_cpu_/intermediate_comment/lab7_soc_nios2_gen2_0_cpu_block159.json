    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating the 'av_ld_align_cycle' signal in sync with the rising edge of the 'clk' signal or falling edge of the 'reset_n' signal. If 'reset_n' signal is 0, it sets 'av_ld_align_cycle' to 0; thus providing a reset mechanism. However, if 'reset_n' is not 0, it update 'av_ld_align_cycle' with the next value held by 'av_ld_align_cycle_nxt' providing means of state progression."
