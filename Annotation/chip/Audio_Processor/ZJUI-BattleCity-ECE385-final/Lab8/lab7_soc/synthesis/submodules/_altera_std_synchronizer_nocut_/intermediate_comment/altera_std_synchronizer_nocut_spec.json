    "spec": "Module name: altera_std_synchronizer_nocut. \n\nModule specification: The altera_std_synchronizer_nocut module is a dedicated standard synchronizer circuit, designed to mitigate metastability issues in digital logic circuits by delaying the input signals that may change at or near the clock edge. This module effectively reduces setup and hold time violations. The module includes the following inputs: the 'clk' clock signal that drives the flip flop stages inside the synchronizer, the 'reset_n' active-low reset signal that initializes or forces the flip-flops into a specific state, and the 'din' input signal to be synchronized. The output of the module is the 'dout' signal, which is the delayed or synchronized version of the 'din' signal.\n\nInternally, the module uses numerous signals. 'din_s1' and 'dreg' are crucial for creating the required delay in the 'din' signal. For simulation purposes, the '__ALTERA_STD__METASTABLE_SIM' directive uses signals like 'RANDOM_SEED', 'next_din_s1', 'din_last', 'random', and 'metastable_event' to simulate metastable events, with 'random' representing a pseudo-random value. \n\nThe code composition is split into different blocks dedicated to various functionalities. The 'initial' block ensures the necessary depth of flip-flops. Under the '__ALTERA_STD__METASTABLE_SIM' directive, blocks of code take care of generating pseudo-random values for simulation and of assigning these values when 'din' changes. Further blocks under the '__ALTERA_STD__METASTABLE_SIM_VERBOSE' directive provide verbose information of metastable events. Additionally, 'generate' blocks handle resetting and updating 'din_s1' and 'dreg' based on the 'reset_n' and 'rst_value' signals respectively. Together, these blocks work to achieve synchronization and smooth debugging for metastable events.",

It drives the flip flop stages in the synchronizer allowing it to delay and capture the input signals thereby solving any metastability issues. \n- 'reset_n' is the active-low reset signal. It is used to initialize the flip-flops in the module at the start, or to force them into a known state when required.\n- 'din' is the data input port that connects to the synchronizer's registers, it is the signal to be synchronized.\n\nOutput ports: ['dout']. Explanation: \n- 'dout' is the data output signal. This is the delayed/synchronized version of the 'din' input signal.

This signal acts as a first stage input for the next series of registers defined by the depth.\n\n- 'dreg': This register chain [depth-2:0] is used to further delay the 'din_s1' signal. The signal goes through a chain of flip-flops equal to the 'depth' parameter to achieve the required delay.\n\n- 'RANDOM_SEED': This is a constant used as a seed for pseudo-random number generation, utilized for simulating metastable events in the \"__ALTERA_STD__METASTABLE_SIM\" directive.\n\n- 'next_din_s1': This is a wire used to hold the next value of 'din_s1' for the simulation of metastability. It takes its value from 'random' signal only when 'din_last' and 'din' are different.\n\n- 'din_last': This register holds the previous value of 'din'. This signal is used for detecting a change in the 'din' signal which triggers a metastable event simulation.\n\n- 'random': This register is used to hold the pseudo-random number generated every clock cycle or on reset, based on the '__ALTERA_STD__METASTABLE_SIM' directive. \n\n- 'metastable_event': This is a named event used to timestamp the occurrence of a simulated metastable event.

                    "text": "Module name: altera_std_synchronizer_nocut. \n\nModule specification: The altera_std_synchronizer_nocut module is a dedicated standard synchronizer circuit, designed to mitigate metastability issues in digital logic circuits by delaying the input signals that may change at or near the clock edge. This module effectively reduces setup and hold time violations. The module includes the following inputs: the 'clk' clock signal that drives the flip flop stages inside the synchronizer, the 'reset_n' active-low reset signal that initializes or forces the flip-flops into a specific state, and the 'din' input signal to be synchronized. The output of the module is the 'dout' signal, which is the delayed or synchronized version of the 'din' signal.\n\nInternally, the module uses numerous signals. 'din_s1' and 'dreg' are crucial for creating the required delay in the 'din' signal. For simulation purposes, the '__ALTERA_STD__METASTABLE_SIM' directive uses signals like 'RANDOM_SEED', 'next_din_s1', 'din_last', 'random', and 'metastable_event' to simulate metastable events, with 'random' representing a pseudo-random value. \n\nThe code composition is split into different blocks dedicated to various functionalities. The 'initial' block ensures the necessary depth of flip-flops. Under the '__ALTERA_STD__METASTABLE_SIM' directive, blocks of code take care of generating pseudo-random values for simulation and of assigning these values when 'din' changes. Further blocks under the '__ALTERA_STD__METASTABLE_SIM_VERBOSE' directive provide verbose information of metastable events. Additionally, 'generate' blocks handle resetting and updating 'din_s1' and 'dreg' based on the 'reset_n' and 'rst_value' signals respectively. Together, these blocks work to achieve synchronization and smooth debugging for metastable events."
