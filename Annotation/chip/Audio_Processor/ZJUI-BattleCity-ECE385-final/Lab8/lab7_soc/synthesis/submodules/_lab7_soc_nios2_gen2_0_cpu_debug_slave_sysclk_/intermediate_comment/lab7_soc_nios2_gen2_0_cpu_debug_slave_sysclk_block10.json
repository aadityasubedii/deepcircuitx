    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for controlling the OCIMEM action based on specific conditions. It assigns the boolean value to 'take_no_action_ocimem_a' signal when 'enable_action_strobe' is active, the Instruction Register ('ir') equals to a binary value of '00', and the 35th and 34th bits of 'jdo' are both not set (equal to '0'). These specific conditions ensure that OCIMEM action is taken only when the right instruction and 'jdo' signal states are present.\n"
