Comment: 
This block of code is essentially used for data assignment in a Verilog register file (RF). The lines extract different bit ranges of the register file "R_rf_b". Specifically, "R_sth_data" is assigned the 16 lower bits (from bit 15 to bit 0) of "R_rf_b".  "R_stw_data" gets the full bit width data (from bit 31 to bit 0). Finally, "R_stb_data" only fetches 8 lower bits (from bit 7 to bit 0) of "R_rf_b".
