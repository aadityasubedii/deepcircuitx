    "block_comment": "The block assigns the future value of the R_ctrl_custom_multi signal. This is implemented using a simple hardware assignment in Verilog, where the current value of D_ctrl_custom_multi is used to define the future value of R_ctrl_custom_multi. This assignment indicates a register-transfer level (RTL) design approach, where a signal's future value is determined by its current state."
