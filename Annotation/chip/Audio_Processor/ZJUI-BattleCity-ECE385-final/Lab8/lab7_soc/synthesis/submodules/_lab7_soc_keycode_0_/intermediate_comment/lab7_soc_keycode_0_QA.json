It takes an address as input, which is a 2-bit value, implying it can address four different storage slots. However, in the provided implementation, only the space at address 0 is written/read. WriteLine is activated when chipselect and ~write_n control inputs are both high and the address is set to 0. During these conditions, 16 LSB bits of \"writedata\" are stored. In any cycle, the content of the register \"data_out\" becomes available from the \"out_port\" output. For reading, it concatenates the value at \"data_out\" with 0s led by conditions when the address is 0, generating 32 bits of output at \"readdata\". If the module reset input 'reset_n' is de-asserted (logical 0), the stored data will be reset to 0. The operation occurs synchronously with the positive edge of the clock 'clk'."
