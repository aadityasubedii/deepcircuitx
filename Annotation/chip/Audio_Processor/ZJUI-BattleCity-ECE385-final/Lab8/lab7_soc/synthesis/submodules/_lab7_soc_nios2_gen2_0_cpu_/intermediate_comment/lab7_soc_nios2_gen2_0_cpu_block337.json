    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a flip-flop with asynchronous reset for managing debug breakpoints. Upon the negative edge of `reset_n`, it sets `dbrk_break` to 0 indicating no active debug breakpoint. For every positive edge of the clock (if not reset), `dbrk_break` is either updated with the negation of `debugack` if `dbrk_break` is true, or with `dbrk_break_pulse`. This way, it maintains or triggers a debug breakpoint based on previous state or existence of a new trigger pulse."
