This block of code is used to display an informational message when the simulation mode is enabled. At the beginning of any simulation, the `$display` system function is initiated, and it outputs a formatted text string, which is `%m: Info: Metastable event injection simulation mode enabled` in this case. The `%m` system task returns a string that contains the hierarchical scope at that point in the code.
