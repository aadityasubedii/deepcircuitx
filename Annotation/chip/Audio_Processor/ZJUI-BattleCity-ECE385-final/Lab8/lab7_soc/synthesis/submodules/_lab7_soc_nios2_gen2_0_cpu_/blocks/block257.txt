Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for setting the value of `tr_data` to 0. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used to create continuous assignments which are used to drive values onto nets. Here, it sets the `tr_data` to a constant value of zero. This is a simple assignment operation, executed continuously to maintain the state of `tr_data`.
