    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a synchronous Reset and Write control logic for a fifo named `fifo_11`. On each positive clock edge, the block checks if `reset_n` is de-asserted; if yes, it resets `fifo_11` back to `0`. If `reset_n` is not de-asserted and `fifo_11_enable` is high, the block takes the `fifo_11_mux` input and assigns it to `fifo_11`."
