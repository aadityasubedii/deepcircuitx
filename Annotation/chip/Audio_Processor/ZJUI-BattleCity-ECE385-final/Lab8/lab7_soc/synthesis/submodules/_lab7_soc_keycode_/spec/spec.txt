Module name: lab7_soc_keycode. 

Module specification: The lab7_soc_keycode module is a component designed to perform simple write and read operations in a larger digital system, specifically a system-on-chip (SoC). It receives an address, a chip select signal, a clock, a reset_n signal, a write_n signal, and 32-bits of write data as inputs, and delivers an 8-bit wide byte and 32-bits of read data as outputs. Functional operation of the module is mainly governed by four internal signals: clk_en, data_out, out_port, read_mux_out, and readdata. clk_en isn't incorporated in the main functionality - it's simply assigned to '1'. The data_out is a register storing the least significant byte of write data whenever the chip is selected (chipselect is high) and write operation is initiated (write_n is low) with an address input of zero. out_port is a wire echoing the value in data_out to the outgoing port. The readdata output port shows a 32-bit modified version of the 'data_out' register. It's generated by zero extending 'read_mux_out' from 8 to 32 bits, providing 'data_out' if the address is zero, otherwise, it shows zero. The module's operations are controlled by the states of these inputs and internal signals, resulting in the activation and deactivation of data writing and reading, as well as output selecting, thereby providing the necessary functionality of a key component of a larger SoC design.
