    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to `E_alu_result`. Depending on the evaluation of various control signals, different values can be assigned. If `R_ctrl_br_cmp` or `R_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg` is true, then `E_alu_result` is assigned the value 0. If either is false but `R_ctrl_shift_rot` is true, then `E_alu_result` is assigned the value of `E_shift_rot_result`. If all of the aforementioned conditions are false but `R_ctrl_logic` is true, then `E_alu_result` is assigned the value of `E_logic_result`. If all previous conditions are false but `R_ctrl_custom` is true, then `E_alu_result` is assigned `E_ci_result`. If all conditions are false, then `E_alu_result` is assigned `E_arith_result`."
