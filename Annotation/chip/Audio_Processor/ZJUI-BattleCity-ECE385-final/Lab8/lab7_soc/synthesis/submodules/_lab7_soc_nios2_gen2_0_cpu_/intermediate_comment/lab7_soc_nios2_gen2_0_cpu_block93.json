    "block_comment": "The block of code is performing an assignment operation in a sequential logic circuit. Specifically, the value of 'D_ctrl_shift_right_arith' is assigned to 'R_ctrl_shift_right_arith_nxt' during the next clock cycle. This implementation is typically found in state-driven or pipeline designs to move data or state from one stage to the next. As this is an 'assign' statement, this assignment takes place continuously, indicating that as soon as 'D_ctrl_shift_right_arith' changes, 'R_ctrl_shift_right_arith_nxt' will also be updated to reflect that change.\n"
