Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog dynamically creates additional logic entities, contingent upon the conditional of EMPTY_LATENCY being greater than 1. When EMPTY_LATENCY's value exceeds 1, the generate construct initiates, which results in the creation of 'gen_blk14'. This functionality allows for a flexible hardware design, providing additional delay stages if needed.
