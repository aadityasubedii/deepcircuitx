The memory can be written to when the Write Enable ('wren') is triggered - this happens when both 'chipselect' and 'write' command are high. The memory read data is captured in 'readdata'. It operates in \"SINGLE_PORT\" operation mode. The memory has a depth of 4 with a width of 32 bits and reads the initial contents from the file 'lab7_soc_onchip_memory2_0.hex'. The size of memory locations that can be individually accessed (byteena) is 4 bytes (or 32 bits). The clocking of the module can be enabled or disabled using the 'clken' and 'reset_req' signals. The state of the RAM can be reset using 'reset'. A 'freeze' signal is also presented but not used in this module. The module also provides an interface for the 'chipselect' signal to enable or disable the module."
