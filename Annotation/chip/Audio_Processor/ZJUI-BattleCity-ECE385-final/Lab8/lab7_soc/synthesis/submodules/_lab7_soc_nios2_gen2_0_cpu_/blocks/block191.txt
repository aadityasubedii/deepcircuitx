Comment: 
This block of code works as a synchronous resettable flip-flop for 'R_logic_op'. At negative edge of 'reset_n', the value of 'R_logic_op' is set to zero, effectively resetting it. For the positive edge of 'clk', the value of 'R_logic_op' is updated with the value of 'D_logic_op' within one clock cycle, acting like a data storage unit.
