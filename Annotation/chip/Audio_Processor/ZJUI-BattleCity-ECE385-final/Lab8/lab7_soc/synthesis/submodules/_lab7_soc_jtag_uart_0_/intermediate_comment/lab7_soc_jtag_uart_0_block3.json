    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for resetting several simulation signals on the rising edge of a clock pulse. On the rising edge of the clock pulse, the signals `sim_t_pause`, `sim_t_ena` and `sim_r_ena` are reset to '0'. Moreover, the `sim_t_dat` signal is conditionally set based on the state of `t_dav` - if `t_dav` is true, `sim_t_dat` is set equal to `r_dat`, otherwise, it is set to the 8-bit version of `r_val`."
