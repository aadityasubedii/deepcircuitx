Comment: 
This Verilog code block serves as a latch, holding and forwarding the values of certain signals. Specifically, the signal `reset_out` receives the value held by `reset_out_pre2`, and `reset_req` receives the value of `reset_req_pre`. As such, the purpose of this code block is to remember and propagate the previous state of these two specific signals within an FPGA or similar digital system. Its implementation follows the typical design of latch circuits.
