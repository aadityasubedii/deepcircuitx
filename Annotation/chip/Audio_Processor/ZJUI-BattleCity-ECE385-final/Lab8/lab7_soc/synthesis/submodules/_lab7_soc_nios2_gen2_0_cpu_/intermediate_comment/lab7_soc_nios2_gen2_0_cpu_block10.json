    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of `D_ctrl_force_src2_zero` via a logical OR operation across several input signals. The operation is completed once the `D_ctrl_force_src2_zero` is equated to any of the input signals ('D_op_*') conditions being true. These input signals appear to represent different operations or states within a larger system. It's being used to ensure that if any one signal is triggered, `D_ctrl_force_src2_zero` will accordingly be set.\n"
