    "block_comment": "The RTL block of code manages a FIFO's fill level under different conditions. On reset, the fill level is set to zero. If the 'drop_on_error' is enabled, the fill level decreases by the current packet length, and further reduced if a read operation is performed. If there's a write operation without a simultaneous read, the fill level is increased by one. Conversely, if there's a read operation without a simultaneous write, the fill level decreases by one. The always block is triggered on the positive edge of both clock and reset signals, making this block of code synchronous."
