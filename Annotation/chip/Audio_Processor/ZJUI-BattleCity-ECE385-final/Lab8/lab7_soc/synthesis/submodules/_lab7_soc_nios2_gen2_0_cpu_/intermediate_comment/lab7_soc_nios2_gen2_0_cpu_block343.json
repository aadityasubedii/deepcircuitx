    "block_comment": "This block of code effectively arms a certain hardware logic represented by 'xbrk1_armed'. The block assigns 'xbrk1_armed' as true if the fifth bit (assuming zero-based index) of the 'xbrk_ctrl1' control signal is set ('1') and the 'trigger_state_0' is also set. Alternatively, it also sets 'xbrk1_armed' if another condition '...' (unshown in the snippet) is true. The '||' denotes a logical OR operation, meaning if either of the conditions is true, the output will be set as true."
