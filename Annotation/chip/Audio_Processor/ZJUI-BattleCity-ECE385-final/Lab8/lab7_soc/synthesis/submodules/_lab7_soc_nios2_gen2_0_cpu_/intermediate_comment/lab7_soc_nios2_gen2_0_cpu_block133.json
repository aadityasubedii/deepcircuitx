    "block_comment": "The block handles the control signal for enabling hardware breaks based on various conditions. It is set to respond at the rising edge of the clock or falling edge of the reset signal. The state of 'hbreak_enabled' can be altered in three ways. If a negative reset signal is asserted, 'hbreak_enabled' is set high to initiate a hardware break. However, when 'E_valid' is true, 'hbreak_enabled' state is decided based on the two other control signals 'R_ctrl_break' and 'D_op_bret'. If 'R_ctrl_break' is true, 'hbreak_enabled' is set to low preventing a break, and if 'D_op_bret' is asserted, 'hbreak_enabled' is set high enabling a break. If neither are true, the state remains unchanged."
