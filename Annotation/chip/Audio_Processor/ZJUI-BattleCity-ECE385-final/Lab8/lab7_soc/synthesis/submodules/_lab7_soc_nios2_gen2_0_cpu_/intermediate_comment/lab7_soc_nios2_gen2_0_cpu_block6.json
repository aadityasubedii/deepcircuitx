    "block_comment": "This block of code handles a register update for 'R_ctrl_alu_force_xor' based on 'clk' or 'reset_n' signals. When a negative edge is detected on 'reset_n', it immediately resets 'R_ctrl_alu_force_xor' to 0; when 'clk' has a positive edge and 'R_en' is enabled, it updates 'R_ctrl_alu_force_xor' to the next state 'R_ctrl_alu_force_xor_nxt'. This block is used in synchronous circuits where system states need to be updated based on clock signals but simultaneously accommodate an urgent reset."
