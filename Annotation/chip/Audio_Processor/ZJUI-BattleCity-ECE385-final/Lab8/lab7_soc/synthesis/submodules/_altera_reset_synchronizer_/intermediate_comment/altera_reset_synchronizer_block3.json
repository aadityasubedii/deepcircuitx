    "block_comment": "This block synchronizes an external reset signal with the system clock (Function). It uses a shift register to delay the input reset signal and eliminate any glitches. DEPTH is the depth of the shift register, which determines the amount of delay. The shift register is represented by an array \"altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain\". At each positive clock edge, the shift register content is shifted to the right, and the input reset signal is loaded at the top (Implementation details)."
