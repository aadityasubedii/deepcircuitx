Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is essentially a synchronous memory control logic block. This block monitors the 'clk' and 'reset' signals and predominantly functions for conditional memory reset or memory updating logic. Upon receiving a positive edge signal either from the 'clk' or 'reset', the instructions within the block execute. If the 'reset' signal is high, the memory location at 'i' is cleared or reset to zero. On the other hand, if 'read' instruction is received or the memory at location 'i' is not used (`!mem_used[i]`), the logical block checks if the memory at location 'i+1' is used. If it is unused, then the 'in_payload' is written into the memory at location 'i'. If the memory at 'i+1' is used, the data at 'i+1' location is relocated to the 'i' location.
