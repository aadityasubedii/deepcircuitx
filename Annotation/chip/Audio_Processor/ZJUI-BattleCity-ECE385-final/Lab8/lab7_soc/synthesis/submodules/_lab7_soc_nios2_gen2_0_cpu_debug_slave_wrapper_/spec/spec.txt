Module name: lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_debug_slave_wrapper.

Module specification: This module acts as a wrapper for two other sub-modules, `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_debug_slave_tck` and `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_debug_slave_sysclk`, and serves as an interface for CPU debugging in a system-on-chip design involving a Nios II Gen2 processor. Its input ports encompass data inputs (`MonDReg` and `break_readreg`), debugging signals (`dbrk_hitX_latch`, `debugack`, `monitor_error`, `monitor_ready`), various controls (`reset_n`, `resetlatch`, `tracemem_on`, `tracemem_tw`, `trc_on`, `trc_wrap`, `trigbrktype`, `trigger_state_1`), clocking signals (`clk`), and tracing data (`tracemem_trcdata` and `trc_im_addr`). The output ports include a data output (`jdo`), a reset signal (`jrst_n`), a status indicator (`st_ready_test_idle`), and a series of control signals indicating the module's actions or inactions (`take_action_X` and `take_no_action_X`). 

Internally, the module uses signals largely related to JTAG interface (`jdo`, `jrst_n`, `sr`, `vji_X`). For instance, `jdo` and `sr` serve as data output and shift register, and `vji_X` signals are for data communication with JTAG. 

The module contains two blocks of code, each instantiating a different sub-module. Essentially, module `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_debug_slave_tck` synchronizes with the test clock signal and focuses on testing elements such as breakpoints, while module `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_debug_slave_sysclk` synchronizes with the system clock, focusing on the system's actions or inactions under various conditions. The module also includes multiple signal assignments, setting default values for the JTAG interface operation.
