    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code sets the value of control signal `E_new_inst` based on the current system state. Upon each positive edge of the clock signal or at any negative edge of the `reset_n` signal, it checks if a system reset (`reset_n == 0`) is requested. If a system reset is initiated, it forces `E_new_inst` to be 0. Otherwise, during normal operation (i.e., no system reset), it sets the value of `E_new_inst` to the current value of the `R_valid` signal."
