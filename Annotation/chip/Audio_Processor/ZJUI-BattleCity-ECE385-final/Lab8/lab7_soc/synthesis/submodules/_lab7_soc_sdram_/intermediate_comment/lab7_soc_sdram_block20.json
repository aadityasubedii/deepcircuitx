    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block describes a state machine for a FIFO buffer controller. On a positive clock edge, or negated reset signal, it adjusts write and read addresses based on the operation code '_rdwr_' in a prioritized order. For reset (_reset_n == 0_), it initializes the read and write addresses, and the total buffer entries count to 0. In case of write operation (_rdwr == 2'd1_ and FIFO not full), it increments the '_entries_' and the '_wr_address_'. In case of read operation (_rdwr == 2'd2_ and FIFO not empty), it decrements the '_entries_' and the '_rd_address_'. In the case of both a read and write operation (_rdwr == 2'd3_), it updates both '_wr_address_' and '_rd_address_' regardless of the FIFO status."
