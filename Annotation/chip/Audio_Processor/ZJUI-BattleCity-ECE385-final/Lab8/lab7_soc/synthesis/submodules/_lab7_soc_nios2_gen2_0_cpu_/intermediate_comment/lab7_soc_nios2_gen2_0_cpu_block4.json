    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the value of `D_ctrl_alu_force_and` to `R_ctrl_alu_force_and_nxt` in the next cycle of the Verilog RTL design. The process is carried out using the `assign` keyword, which in Verilog means the right-hand side expression is continuously driven onto the left-hand side net. This statement signifies data flow from `D_ctrl_alu_force_and` to `R_ctrl_alu_force_and_nxt` which likely forms part of a controlled ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) enforcing 'and' operation in the next timeframe. The nature of the signalling suggests this block is part of a larger ALU management architecture within a CPU system design."
