    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the enable signal of a first-in-first-out (FIFO) memory block called 'fifo_1'. The enable signal 'fifo_1_enable' is asserted under three conditions. The first condition is when the FIFO write pointer 'fifo_wrptr' equals 1 and the input 'input_ge1' is high. The second condition is when 'ge2_free' is high, 'fifo_wrptr_plus1' equals 1, and 'input_ge2' is high - indicating the second slot in the FIFO is free and input ge2 is ready. The third condition is when 'ge3_free' is high, 'fifo_wrptr_plus2' equals 1, and 'input_ge3' is high - stating that third slot in the FIFO is free and input ge3 is ready. This block thus orchestrates the flow of data into the FIFO based on pointer locations and availability of inputs."
