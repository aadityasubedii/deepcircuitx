Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable FIFO for the Altera Avalon Streaming Interface. It uses parameterizable depth, data width, and optional features like packet handling and fill level monitoring. The FIFO employs dual pointers for read/write operations, supports memory block or shift register implementations, and includes control logic for packet mode, error handling, and thresholds. It manages data flow with flags for full/empty states and provides interfaces for status monitoring and control.
