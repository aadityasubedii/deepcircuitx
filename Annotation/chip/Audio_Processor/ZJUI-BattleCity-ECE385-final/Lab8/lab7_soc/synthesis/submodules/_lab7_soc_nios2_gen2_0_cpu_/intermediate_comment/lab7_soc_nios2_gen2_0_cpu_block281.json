    "block_comment": "The block of code is a multiplexer (mux) operation for an 8-point FIFO (First In First Out) queue. It chooses the input to feed into the FIFO based on several conditions. If the write-pointer (fifo_wrptr) is at the 8th position and itm, atm, dtm are valid, the mux assigns the relevant input to fifo_8_mux. When the fifo_wrptr is advanced by one (fifo_wrptr_plus1) and is at the 8th position, it checks for the availability of free spaces (ge2_free) and the validness of itm, atm, dtm inputs to assign correspondent overflow handling inputs. The default assignment to fifo_8_mux is overflow_pending_dtm."
