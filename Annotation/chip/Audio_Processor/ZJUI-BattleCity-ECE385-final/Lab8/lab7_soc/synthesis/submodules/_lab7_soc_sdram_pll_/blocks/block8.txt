This block of Verilog code deploys a Standard Synchronization Process specific to an SDRAM PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) module within a System on Chip (SoC). The implementation uses an instance "stdsync2" of the "lab7_soc_sdram_pll_stdsync_sv6" module. The input clock signal "clk" and data signal "wire_sd1_locked" are received from the overall SoC, which are then synchronized through this block. The result of this synchronization is passed as output "wire_stdsync2_dout". An active-low reset signal is used to put the module in its initial state.
