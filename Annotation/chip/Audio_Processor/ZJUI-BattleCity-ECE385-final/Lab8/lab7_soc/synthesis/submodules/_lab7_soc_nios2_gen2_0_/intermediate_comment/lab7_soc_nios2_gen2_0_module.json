    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\n// Module lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0 is a wrapper for the CPU instance (`lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu`), responsible for routing input/output connections from the main module's interface to the CPU's instance. It accommodates several input and output ports handling operations like data/instruction read/write, interrupt handling, debug accesses. There are no explicitly defined internal signals. The main implementation detail is the instantiation of the `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu` and the mapping of the input/output ports of the main module to the CPU instance. This routing enables the CPU instance in the system-wide context."
