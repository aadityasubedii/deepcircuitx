This block of code declares a 4-bit wide register named td_mode. The register is used to store data temporarily within the hardware design. The square brackets, [3:0], specify that it's a four-bit register ranging from bit 0 to bit 3. The register's value can be altered as per the operations in the remaining part of the Verilog RTL design code.
