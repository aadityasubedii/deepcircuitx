    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a logical AND operation between the sixth bit (starting from 0) of the `xbrk_ctrl3` signal and the state of the `trigger_state_1` signal. Such operations are often used in control-flow logic or to mask certain bits in a bit-vector. The resulting value will be a high logic level ('1') only if both the sixth bit of `xbrk_ctrl3` and `trigger_state_1` are also at the high level, otherwise, the result will be a low logic level ('0')."
