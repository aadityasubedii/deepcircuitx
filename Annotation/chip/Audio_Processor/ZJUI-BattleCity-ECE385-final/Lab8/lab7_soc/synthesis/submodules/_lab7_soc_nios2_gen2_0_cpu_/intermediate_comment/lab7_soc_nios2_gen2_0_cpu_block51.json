    "block_comment": "The block of code provides the control signal for loading data from memory. This block uses bitwise OR operations to combine multiple load operations into a single control signal. The load operations include instructions for loading bytes, halfwords, words, and their respective unsigned variations, both from immediate offsets (denoted with 'io') and base addresses."
