    "block_comment": "This block of code is managing the value of the `address` signal in a digital circuit. At the positive edge of the clock signal or the negative edge of the `jrst_n` signal, it checks if `jrst_n` is 0 and if so, resets `address` to 0. If `jrst_n` is not 0, it updates `address` with the value of `address_nxt`. This implementation is typically used as part of a state machine or a frequency divider in clock-based designs."
