    "block_comment": "This block is a flip-flop module designed for handling Integer Bit Field (IBF) operations. It either sets or updates the state of the 'pfdena_reg' register based on the conditional checks. On receiving a positive edge clock signal or a reset signal, the block first checks if the reset signal is high. If true, the 'pfdena_reg' register is reset by setting all its bits to 1. Otherwise, if 'wire_pfdena_reg_ena' flag is enabled (set to 1), the 'pfdena_reg' register is updated with the second bit of 'writedata'."
