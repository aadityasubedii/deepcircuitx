    "block_comment": "This block of code is a D-flip-flop with synchronous reset functionality in a digital circuit. The primary operation of this block is to control any exceptions that might occur. The flip-flop changes state on the positive edge of the clock or when the reset signal is active low. When the reset signal (`reset_n`) is activated, the `R_ctrl_exception` is made 0, i.e. the exception controller is reset. This gives the module an ability to reset the exception controller on demand. However, if the reset signal is not active (high) and when the enable (`R_en`) signal is high, the output follows the state of the next control exception (`R_ctrl_exception_nxt`), on the next clock pulse."
