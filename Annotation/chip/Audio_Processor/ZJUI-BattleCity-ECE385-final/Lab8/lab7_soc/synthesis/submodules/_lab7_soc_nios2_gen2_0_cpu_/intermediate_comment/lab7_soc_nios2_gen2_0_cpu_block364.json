    "block_comment": "This block handles the assignment and formatting of specific debugging and control bits within a chip design. It does this via wire and reg variables that depict different break points (break_a to break_c), control points (xbrk_ctrl0 to xbrk_ctrl3), and trigger points (trigger_state) within the system. It assigns bits from the jdo wire to respective break points. For instance, it takes the 35th to the 32nd bits from jdo wire and assigns them to a break point break_a_wpr, it further breaks down these bits into high bits and low bits. It also assigns the 33rd and 32nd bits from the jdo wire to break points break_b_rr and break_c_rr respectively."
