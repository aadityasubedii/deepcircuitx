Explanation: \n\n- \"lab7_soc_sdram_input_efifo_module\": This module appears to be a Elastic FIFO (First In, First Out) implementation particularly for handling writes (wr_data) and read operations (rd_data). It ensures synchronization to take action like read or write on the rising edge of the clock. It also manages empty and full conditions of the FIFO queue, and handles reset condition. \n\n- \"lab7_soc_sdram\": This module implements an interface to a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM). It handles reading and writing data to/from the SDRAM by utilizing the elastic FIFO module. This includes the handling of various memory states, addressing, refresh operations, setting the SDRAM command lines, and transferring data.
