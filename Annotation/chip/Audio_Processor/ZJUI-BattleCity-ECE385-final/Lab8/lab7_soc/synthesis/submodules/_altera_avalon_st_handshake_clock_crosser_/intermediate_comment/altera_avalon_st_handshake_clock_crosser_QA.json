This module can be parameterized based on data width, use of packets, channels, errors, synchronization depth, and other parameters. The input payload is formed by the incoming data, packets (if used), channels (if used), empty symbols, and errors (if used). This payload is then passed through a clock crosser which can manage different clock domains for input and output data. Further, the output payload is split into data, packets (if used), channels (if used), empty symbols, and errors (if used). By doing so, it ensures the safe crossing of data across different clock domains avoiding potential issues such as metastability."
