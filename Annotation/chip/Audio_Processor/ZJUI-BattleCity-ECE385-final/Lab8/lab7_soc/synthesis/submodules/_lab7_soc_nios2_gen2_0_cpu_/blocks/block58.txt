This block is a simple assignment operation in Verilog. It assigns the value of the current state of the `D_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison` to the next state, `R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison_nxt`. This assignment is performed concurrently as denoted by the `assign` keyword in Verilog. This design strategy employed is a basic state transition methodology, considering the control signal for the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) signed comparison. This aims to maintain the necessary synchronisation for sequential processing in a digital circuit or system.
