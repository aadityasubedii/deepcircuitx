Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is an increment controller for a write pointer of a FIFO. The block utilizes an always block to monitor the status of `ge2_free`, `ge3_free` and `input_tm_cnt` signals. If `ge3_free` is high and `input_tm_cnt` equals 3, the write pointer increases by 3. If `ge3_free` doesn't meet the condition but `ge2_free` is high and `input_tm_cnt` is 2 or more, the write pointer increases by 2. If neither `ge2_free` nor `ge3_free` are high but `input_tm_cnt` is at least 1, the pointer increases by 1. If none of these conditions are met, the write pointer does not increment (`fifo_wrptr_inc` is set to 0).
