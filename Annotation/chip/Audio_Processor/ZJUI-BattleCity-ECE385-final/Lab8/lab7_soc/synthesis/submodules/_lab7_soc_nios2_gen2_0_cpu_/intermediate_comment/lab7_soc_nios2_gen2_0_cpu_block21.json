    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to assert the D_ctrl_ignore_dst output signal. It uses bitwise OR operations to check whether any of listed control signals are asserted. If any of these signals (D_op_br, D_op_bge, D_op_blt, D_op_bne, D_op_beq, D_op_bgeu, D_op_bltu, D_op_stb, D_op_sth, D_op_stw, D_op_stbio, D_op_sthio, D_op_stwio, D_op_jmpi) are '1', then the D_ctrl_ignore_dst signal will be asserted. This block of code thus determines whether to ignore the destination, based on the specific operation being performed."
