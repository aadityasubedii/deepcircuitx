This block mainly performs alignment operations on loaded data, ensuring the data is properly lined up for future processes. It determines the loading of alignment cycles through conditions based on data retrieval and maintains cycle progression unless data is being fetched. Implementing this, it also handles one additional cycle, handling different system commands varying on a memory flag. The next alignment state is influenced by current alignment and data retrieving statuses and combines with another memory command condition to control alignment. Subsequently, it handles the shifting and extending of data bytes through reference to ongoing alignment and cycle status, optimizing the memory address reference depending on the alignment needs while also filtering out unwanted extensions. Lastly, it organizes the final data alignment, flags up the sign bit and sets the fill bit, supporting signed loading commands.
