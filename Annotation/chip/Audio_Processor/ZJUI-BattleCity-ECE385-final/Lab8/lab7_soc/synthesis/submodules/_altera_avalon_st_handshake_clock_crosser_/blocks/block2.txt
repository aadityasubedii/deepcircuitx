The block of code assigns a default value to the error output signal. In its implementation, it specifies that the output 'out_error' wire should be constantly set to a 1-bit binary value of 0, hence ensuring the 'out_error' signal is initially or by default in a non-error state. It is initialised in this way until another code block or condition alters this signal value.
