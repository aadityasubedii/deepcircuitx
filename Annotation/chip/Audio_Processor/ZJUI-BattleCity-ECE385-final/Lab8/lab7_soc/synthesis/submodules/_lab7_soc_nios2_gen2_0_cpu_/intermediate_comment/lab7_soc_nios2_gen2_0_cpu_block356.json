    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the output and input signals for a given digital circuit. The output signals are xbrk_break, xbrk_goto0, xbrk_goto1, xbrk_traceoff, xbrk_traceon, and xbrk_trigout; these may serve various purposes such as indicating a break condition, triggering specific actions, or controlling trace functionalities. The input signal D_valid, signifies the validity of the input data provided to the circuit. The functioning of these signals is entirely dependent on the subsequent logic implemented in the circuit."
