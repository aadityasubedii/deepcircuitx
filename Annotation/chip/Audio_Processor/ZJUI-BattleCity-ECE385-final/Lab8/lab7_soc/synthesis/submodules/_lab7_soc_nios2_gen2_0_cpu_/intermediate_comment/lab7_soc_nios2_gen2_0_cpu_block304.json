    "block_comment": "This block of code is a Verilog description for assigning the correct input to a FIFO (First In, First Out) multiplexer, 'fifo_0_mux', based on several conditions. It primarily uses ternary conditional statements to decide the multiplexer input. If itm is valid and the write pointer is zero (a sign that the FIFO is empty), itm becomes the input. Similarly, for valid atm and dtm, their corresponding overflow status will be forwarded to the FIFO. If the calculations show that the FIFO will be empty next time (fifo_wrptr_plus1==0), and a valid combination of itm, atm, and dtm exist in the correct sequence, the FIFO will select the input from the overflow of atm or dtm. The default choice for the multiplexer is the overflow from dtm."
