    "block_comment": "This block initializes a module `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_register_bank_b`, which functions as a register bank within a Nios II Gen2 processor. It connects inputs and outputs for various operations. The `clock` signal is driven by `clk`, while `data` for writing to the register bank comes from `W_rf_wr_data`. The `q` output provides the register bank data. `rdaddress` and `wraddress` take addresses for read and write operations, sourced from `D_iw_b` and `W_dst_regnum` respectively. The write enable signal `wren` is coupled with `W_rf_wren`."
