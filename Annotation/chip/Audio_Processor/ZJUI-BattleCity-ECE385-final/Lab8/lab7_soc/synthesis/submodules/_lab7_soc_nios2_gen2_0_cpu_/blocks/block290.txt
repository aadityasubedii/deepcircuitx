This block assigns a variable, 'fifo_5_mux', based on the complex conditions of different data-path flows in a FIFO structure. When the write pointer 'fifo_wrptr' equals 5, and the corresponding valid bit (from itm/atm/dtm) is high, 'fifo_5_mux' gets the associated data. If not, the block considers the case where the incremented write pointer 'fifo_wrptr_plus1' equals 5. If this holds true and both required resources (signified by 'ge2_free') and two specific valid bits are high, 'fifo_5_mux' is assigned the overflow pending data. In all other situations, 'overflow_pending_dtm' is assigned to 'fifo_5_mux'.
