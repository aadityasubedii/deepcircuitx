Comment: 
The selected block is primarily designed for addressing specific registers and handling strobe signals based on certain conditions. The block initially decodes the address to identify whether `oci_reg_00` or `oci_reg_01` are addressed by comparing the address to known values (`9'h100` and `9'h101`). Subsequently, a write strobe signal is generated, which is active during the debug access and write operation. This signal is then used to determine whether an action should be taken for `oci_reg_00` or `oci_reg_01`. The last two lines of code are designed for parsing the write data to two separate output signals, `ocireg_ers` and `ocireg_mrs`, by utilising the two least significant bits of the `writedata`.
