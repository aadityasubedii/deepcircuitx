    "block_comment": "The block of code is for establishing write control operations. The block configures control instances for three different registers `E_wrctl_estatus`, `E_wrctl_bstatus`, and `E_wrctl_ienable` through bitwise AND operations with `R_ctrl_wrctl_inst`. The configuration for each register is determined by the value of `D_iw_control_regnum`, an input wire, being equal to a specific 5-bit number. The logic ensures that the control instance is enabled only for the correct register based on the input wire value."
