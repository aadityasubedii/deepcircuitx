    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the control signals related to loading IOs, conditional branching, and write-back destinations in a digital circuit. It uses flip-flops to save or clear control signals synchronously with a clock condition. For `R_ctrl_ld_io`, which is a loading IO control signal, it sets the value to 0 when reset signal is low and assigns the next value when enabled. `D_ctrl_b_is_dst` is a logical OR of various operation flags, specifying when a destination value is being calculated. This value is then asynchronously bound to `R_ctrl_b_is_dst` with a similar conditions as the load IO control. `D_ctrl_ignore_dst` is another OR operation of different operation flags that signals when to ignore destination write-back during operation, also loaded synchronously in a flip-flop."
