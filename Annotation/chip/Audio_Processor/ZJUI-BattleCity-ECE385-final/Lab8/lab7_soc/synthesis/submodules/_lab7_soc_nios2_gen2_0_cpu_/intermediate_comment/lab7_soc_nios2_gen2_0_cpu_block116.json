    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code handles the assignment of the next-state logic for the `R_ctrl_implicit_dst_eretaddr` register. The value of `R_ctrl_implicit_dst_eretaddr_nxt` is assigned the current value of `D_ctrl_implicit_dst_eretaddr`. Essentially, it passes the data from the 'D' stage of the pipeline to the 'R' stage in the next clock cycle."
