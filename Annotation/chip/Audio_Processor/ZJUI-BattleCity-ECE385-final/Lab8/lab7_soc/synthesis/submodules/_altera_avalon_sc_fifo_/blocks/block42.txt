This Verilog module is designed to implement a flip-flop with reset and set functionality. The flip-flop is a fundamental building block of digital circuits used to store a bit of data. The implementation here includes an always block that triggers on either the positive edge of the clock (clk) or when either the reset (rst_n) or set (set_n) signals are detected. This ensures that the flip-flop will be set or reset as required, regardless of the clock state. If the reset signal is given, the flip-flop is reset (output q is set to 0), if the set signal is given, the flip-flop is set (output q is set to 1), otherwise, on each clock's positive edge, it takes the value of the data input (d).
