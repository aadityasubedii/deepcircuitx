    "block_comment": "This Verilog block manages the state transitions of the W_up_ex_mon_state register. The register state is controlled by either a reset signal, or other controlling signals, namely R_en, R_ctrl_ld_ex, W_valid, D_op_eret, R_ctrl_st_ex. When a reset (reset_n) signal is encountered (when it is 0), the register state is reset to 0. When the R_en signal is encountered, the state of the register is determined by underlying conditions: if R_ctrl_ld_ex and W_valid are true, the state becomes 1, if D_op_eret and W_valid, or R_ctrl_st_ex and W_valid are true, the state becomes 0. If none of the above conditions meet, the state remains the same. This operation is synchronized with the rising edge of the clock."
