The module uses parameters to set up incoming and outgoing data streams. The parameters adjust the symbol size and amount per beat. The pipeline can operate in two modes based on the PIPELINE_READY parameter: a registered ready pipeline where it uses two registers, and an unregistered one that uses one register. The input data is stored in these registers until it is transmitted to the output bus. The \"in_ready\" signal indicates if the input register can accept data, and \"out_valid\" if there is data ready to be transmitted from the output register. The module handles clock and reset signals to maintain and initialize the system."
