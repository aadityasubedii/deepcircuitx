    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles selection and matching of bank address, read or write operations, and row addressing within a semiconductor memory system. It uses bitwise operations and boolean algebra to manage and compare active and pending states. It aligns the 'cs_n' (chip select), 'rnw' (read not write), 'bank', and 'row' bits of the active address and the feature address, checks the matching result, and generates a signal to indicate if there is a pending operation. If 'f_select' is True, 'cas_addr' (Column Address Strobe address) is assigned to the lower 10 bits of the feature address; otherwise, 'cas_addr' is assigned to the lower 10 bits of the active address."
