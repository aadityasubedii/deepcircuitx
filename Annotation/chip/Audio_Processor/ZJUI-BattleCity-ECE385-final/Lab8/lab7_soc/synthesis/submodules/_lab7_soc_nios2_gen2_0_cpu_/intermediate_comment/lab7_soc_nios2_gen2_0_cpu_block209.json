    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous module that handles the internal read signal (i_read) depending on the state of the clock (\"clk\") and reset signal (reset_n). If the reset signal is low (negative edge-triggered), the read command is immediately set to HIGH. Otherwise, on the positive edge of the clock signal, the read command is updated with the value of the next read command (i_read_nxt)."
