    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a conditional assignment operation for the variable 'cfgrom_readdata' based on the value of 3 bits extracted from the 'MonAReg' register. The operation checks the value of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th least significant bits in the 'MonAReg' and assigns a different hexadecimal value to 'cfgrom_readdata' for each possible 3-bit value. If the 3-bit value is not within the range of 0 to 6, it defaults to assigning 'cfgrom_readdata' with '32'h00000000'."
