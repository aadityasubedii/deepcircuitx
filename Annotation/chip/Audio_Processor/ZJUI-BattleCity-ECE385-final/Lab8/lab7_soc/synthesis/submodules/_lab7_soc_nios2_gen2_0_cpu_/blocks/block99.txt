This block of code performs the function of updating the return address register in a controller block of a sequential hardware design. It uses an 'assign' statement, a continuous assignment feature in Verilog, to continuously assign the value of the 'D_ctrl_retaddr' (which could probably be the return address from a decode stage in a pipeline) to 'R_ctrl_retaddr_nxt' (the next return address in a register stage).
