Comment: 
The block of code enables a second FIFO buffer. This is accomplished by assigning the boolean `fifo_2_enable` based on the status of write pointer `fifo_wrptr` and the presence of input slots. The operation conditionally checks if the write pointer is at position two and if there's data on the input `input_ge1`, or alternatively, if there's space available on the secondary `input_ge2` or tertiary `input_ge3` channels (verified by `ge2_free` and `ge3_free`), and if the incremented write pointers `fifo_wrptr_plus1` or `fifo_wrptr_plus2`, are positioned at the second location.
