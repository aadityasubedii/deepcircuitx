Comment: 
The block of Verilog RTL code defines a flip-flop which gets updated on a rising edge of the clock signal (clk) or falling edge of the asynchronous reset signal (reset_n). If the reset signal is active (low), the block sets the output 'din_last' to either 1'b0 or 1'b1 based on the reset value ‘rst_value’. If the reset signal is inactive (high), 'din_last' assumes the current value of the 'din' input on the next rising edge of the clock signal.
