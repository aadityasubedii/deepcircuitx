It has several different parameters defining its specific behavior, such as FIFO depth, number of symbols per beat, bits per symbol, and more. The FIFO operates with both read and write pointers, defined by the addresses for storing and recalling data elements. It includes features like error channels, support for packet mode, and adjustable fill levels among others. It can be used with memory blocks or as a shift register as per configuration."
