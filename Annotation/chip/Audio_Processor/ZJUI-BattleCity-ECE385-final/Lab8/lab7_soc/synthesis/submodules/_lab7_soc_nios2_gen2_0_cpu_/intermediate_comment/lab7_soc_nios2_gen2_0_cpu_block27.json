    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a memory register for a control block. Using synchronous reset and clock signalling, if the reset signal is active-low (i.e., reset_n == 0), the memory register (R_ctrl_mem32) is reset to zero. Conversely, when there's a rising clock edge and R_en is high (i.e., R_en == 1), the register R_ctrl_mem32 is updated to the value of R_ctrl_mem32_nxt, thus enabling the storage of this control signal."
