Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is for handling memory operations with special handling of the last index in an array. On every positive clock edge and when the reset is high, it resets the last memory element to 0. If the reset is not high and DEPTH is 1, it updates the last memory element with the input payload when the write signal is high. If DEPTH is not 1, and the last memory index is not used (indicated by the mem_used array), it also writes the input payload to the last memory location. This control is done by using if-else control structures that execute based on the conditions of the reset, write, and mem_used flags.
