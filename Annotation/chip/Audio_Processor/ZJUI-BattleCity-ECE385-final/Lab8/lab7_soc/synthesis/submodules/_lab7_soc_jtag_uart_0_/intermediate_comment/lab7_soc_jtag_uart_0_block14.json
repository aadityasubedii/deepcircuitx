    "block_comment": "The given block of code controls FIFO (First-In, First-Out) memory state parameters. It assigns the value 'true' to 'fifo_EF' if there are no bytes left, and sets 'rfifo_full' to 'true' if the remaining bytes exceed 64. Number of entries in the FIFO is decided through a conditional operator - if 'rfifo_full' is 'true', it sets 'rfifo_entries' to 64, else it sets to the number of bytes left. 'rfifo_used' holds the number of FIFO entries used, giving 6 least significant bits of 'rfifo_entries'. The block also sets 'new_rom' and 'num_bytes' as 0."
