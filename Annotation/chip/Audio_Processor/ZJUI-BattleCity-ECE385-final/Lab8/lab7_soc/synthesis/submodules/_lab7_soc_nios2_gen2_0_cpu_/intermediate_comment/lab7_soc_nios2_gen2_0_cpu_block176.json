    "block_comment": "This block of code forms a synchronous resettable register. It uses a clock signal ('clk') to synchronize its operation and a reset signal ('reset_n') to clear its contents. When the system is reset (i.e., 'reset_n' is 0), this block forces 'E_src1' to zero. In normal operation (i.e., 'reset_n' is not 0), it captures the value of 'R_src1' on each positive edge of the 'clk' signal, effectively transferring the data from 'R_src1' to 'E_src1'."
