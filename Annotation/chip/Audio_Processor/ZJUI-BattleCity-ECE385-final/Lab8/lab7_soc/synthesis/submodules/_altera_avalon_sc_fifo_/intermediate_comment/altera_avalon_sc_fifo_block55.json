    "block_comment": "This block of code handles data storage and retrieval in a synchronous manner. It writes the 'in_payload' into a memory array at the 'wr_ptr' location when both 'in_valid' and 'in_ready' conditions are met during the positive edge clock cycle. It also retrieves and stores data from the memory array from the 'mem_rd_ptr' location to 'internal_out_payload' at every clock cycle."
