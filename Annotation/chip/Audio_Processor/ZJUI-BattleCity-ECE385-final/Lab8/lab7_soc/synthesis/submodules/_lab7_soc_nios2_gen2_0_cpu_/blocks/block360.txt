Comment: 
This block of code is a state-driven trigger system for hardware debugging. It is built to reset or change the trigger state in response to certain flags (`xbrk_goto0`, `xbrk_goto1`, `dbrk_goto0`, `dbrk_goto1`) during the positive clock edge or the negation of `jrst_n`. When reset (`jrst_n` equals 0), the `trigger_state` is set to 0. Moreover, when the `trigger_state` is 1 and if either `xbrk_goto0` or `dbrk_goto0` flags are set, it resets the `trigger_state`. Similarly, when the `trigger_state` is 0 and either `xbrk_goto1` or `dbrk_goto1` are flagged, it sets `trigger_state` to -1.
