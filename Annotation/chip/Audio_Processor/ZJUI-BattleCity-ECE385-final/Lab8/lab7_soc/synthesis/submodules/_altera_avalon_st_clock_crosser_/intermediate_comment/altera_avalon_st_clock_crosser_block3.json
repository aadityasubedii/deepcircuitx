    "block_comment": "The provided block of code controls the data buffering and data toggling based on the conditions of a rising clock edge or a reset signal. Specifically, this block of code negates the output data buffer and resets the toggle upon a reset signal. Otherwise, during a rising clock edge, the input data buffer is assigned to the output data buffer. Meanwhile, if the output data has been taken (indicated by the flag 'out_data_taken'), the value of 'out_data_toggle' is assigned to 'out_data_toggle_flopped'."
