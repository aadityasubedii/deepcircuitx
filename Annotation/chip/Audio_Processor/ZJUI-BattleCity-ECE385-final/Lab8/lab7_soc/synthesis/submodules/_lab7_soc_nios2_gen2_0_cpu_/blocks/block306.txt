This block of code controls the enabling of a FIFO buffer, fifo_0. It checks three conditions before enabling fifo_0: the first condition is that the write pointer of the FIFO is at position '0' and there is at least one input, the second condition is that there is at least one free slot in the second buffer (ge2), the write pointer plus 1 points to the position '0', and there is at least two inputs, the third condition is that there is at least one free slot in the third buffer (ge3), the write pointer plus 2 points to the position '0', and there is at least three inputs. Only when one or more of these conditions are satisfied, will the FIFO be enabled by assigning '1' to fifo_0_enable.
