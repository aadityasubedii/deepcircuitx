Comment: 
The block of code sends an interrupt request `intr_req` when certain conditions are met. Specifically, it assigns the Boolean AND operation result of `W_status_reg_pie` and the negation of equality comparison between `W_ipending_reg` and zero to the `intr_req` signal. In other words, an interrupt request is generated if the `W_status_reg_pie` is active (usually indicating that hardware interrupts are allowed) and there are pending interrupts (`W_ipending_reg` not being zero). This operation is executed every clock cycle due to the assign keyword, ensuring timely responses to changes in the system's condition.
