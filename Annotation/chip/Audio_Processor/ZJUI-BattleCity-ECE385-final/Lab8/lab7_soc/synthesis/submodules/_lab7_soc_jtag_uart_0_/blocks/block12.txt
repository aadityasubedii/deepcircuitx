Comment: 
This Verilog block defines a module called `lab7_soc_jtag_uart_0_scfifo_r`, which is a read only FIFO buffer in a JTAG UART System-on-Chip. The module has a clear signal (fifo_clear), a read signal (fifo_rd), a reset signal (rst_n), a write data interface (t_dat) and a write signal (wr_rfifo) as inputs, while it provides the empty flag (fifo_EF), read data (fifo_rdata), a full flag (rfifo_full) and the used space (rfifo_used) as outputs. The block creates an instance of `lab7_soc_jtag_uart_0_sim_scfifo_r` by connecting its internal signals and is designed to work with a single clock source (clk).
