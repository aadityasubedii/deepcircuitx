    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the assignment of the `D_ctrl_shift_rot_right` control signal. The particular signal is set if any one of the operation codes `D_op_srli`, `D_op_srl`, `D_op_srai`, `D_op_sra`, `D_op_ror` is activated. This implementation provides functionality for different types of shift and rotate right operations in a processor design."
