    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines the outputs for a component that's likely part of a memory management or debugging system. The `debug_mem_slave_debugaccess_to_roms` output might indicate whether this module has successfully gained debug access to ROMs. `oci_hbreak_req` could be used to signal a hardware breakpoint request. The `oci_ienable` 32-bit output likely controls interrupt enable signals. The `oci_single_step_mode` output might indicate whether the module is in a single-step debug mode. The `readdata` output, also 32 bits wide, seems to be providing data read from some memory resource. Lastly, the `resetrequest` and `waitrequest` outputs might be used to control the state of external processes, by requesting they reset or wait, respectively."
