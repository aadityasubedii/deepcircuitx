Comment: 
This block of Verilog code describes the operation of a shift register with synchronous reset. During every positive edge of the clock (or when reset goes low), the block of code is evaluated. If the reset signal is active (logic 0), the shift register, `dreg`, is set to a length `depth` bit-vector of all 1's. If the reset signal is not active, the register `dreg` is updated to accommodate new input `din_s1`, by shifting prior values left (higher indexes) and placing the new data at the 0th index, effectively implementing a left shift operation.
