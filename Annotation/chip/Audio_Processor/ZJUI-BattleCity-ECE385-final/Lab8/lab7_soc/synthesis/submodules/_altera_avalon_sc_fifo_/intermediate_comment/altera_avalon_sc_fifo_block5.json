    "block_comment": "The block is used for error handling, specifically to check if a packet should be dropped based on certain error conditions. It achieves this by using logical AND (&) operators to combine various boolean signals: 'drop_on_error_en', 'error_in_pkt', 'in_pkt_error', and 'in_pkt_eop_arrive'. If all of these signals are true ('1'), the 'drop_on_error' signal will be asserted, indicating that the packet should be dropped due to an error."
