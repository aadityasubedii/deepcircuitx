    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a synchronous reset, synchronous data transfer behavior for `E_alu_sub` signal. If the active-low reset signal `reset_n` is low, `E_alu_sub` is reset to 0. If the reset is not active, on the rising edge of the clock signal `clk`, the value of the AND operation on `D_ctrl_alu_subtract` and `R_valid` is transferred to `E_alu_sub`."
