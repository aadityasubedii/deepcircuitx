Without more context or information, it's tough to identify this verilog block's function accurately. It seems to be a part of conditional code block (else clause) that would be executed when some specific condition(s) is/are not met. The label "gen_blk19_else2" suggests that it's probably a generated block, probably coming from a for/generate construct. But without the actual lines of code inside this block along with the preceding conditional statement, exact function or implementation details can't really be mentioned. 

For processing this for language modelling, you might want to associate this code block with the part of code it is tied with (the conditional construct 'if' part and actual lines of code within 'else' part) to form a coherent training input. 

An example of the structure would be, 
```
input: `if (condition) begin : gen_blk19_if <...lines of code...> end else begin : gen_blk19_else2 <...lines of code...> end`
output: `<Function of given block.> <Implementation detail of given block.>`
``` 
This would provide a broad context for a language model to learn from and generate more meaningful descriptions. A similar process would be repeated for various blocks of Verilog RTL code.
