    "block_comment": "This block represents the inputs for a digital system, possibly part of a debugging module. The 'clk' input refers to the system clock. Flags for various debug actions are presented: 'dbrk_break' is likely a debug break signal; 'dbrk_goto0' and 'dbrk_goto1' may be debug routing signals. 'jdo' could be a 38-bit value that is possibly to input data or an address for a jump operation; 'jrst_n' might be a reset signal for the jump operation. The inputs 'take_action_break_[a-c]' might be associated with execution of certain actions upon reaching specific breakpoints while debugging. 'take_no_action_break_[a-c]' may handle scenarios where no actions are taken on hitting specific breakpoints. 'xbrk_goto0' could be an alternative routing signal for a break situation."
