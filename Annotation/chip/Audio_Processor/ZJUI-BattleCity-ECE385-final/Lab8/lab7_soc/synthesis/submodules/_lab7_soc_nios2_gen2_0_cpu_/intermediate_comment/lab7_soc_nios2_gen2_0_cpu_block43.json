    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a synchronous reset and load logic for a register named `R_ctrl_ld_non_io`. The reset condition is active low, indicated by `reset_n == 0`; in this case, the register is cleared (set to 0). Otherwise, if the loading condition `R_en` is true, the value of the `R_ctrl_ld_non_io` register is updated to `R_ctrl_ld_non_io_nxt` on the rising edge of the clock `clk`.\n"
