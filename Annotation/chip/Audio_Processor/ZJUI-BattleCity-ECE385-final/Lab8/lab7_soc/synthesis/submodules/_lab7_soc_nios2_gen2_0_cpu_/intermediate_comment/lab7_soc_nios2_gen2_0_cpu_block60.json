    "block_comment": "This block implements a synchronous reset behavior for the `R_ctrl_alu_subtract` register. The values are updated at the positive edge of clock signal or a negative edge of `reset_n`. When the `reset_n` signal goes low (0), the register `R_ctrl_alu_subtract` is reset to 0. However, if `reset_n` is not asserted and `R_en` (presumably a system flag) is high, the register `R_ctrl_alu_subtract` is updated with the value from `R_ctrl_alu_subtract_nxt`. This design ensures that `R_ctrl_alu_subtract` register retains its value unless explicitly reset or updated under strictly controlled conditions."
