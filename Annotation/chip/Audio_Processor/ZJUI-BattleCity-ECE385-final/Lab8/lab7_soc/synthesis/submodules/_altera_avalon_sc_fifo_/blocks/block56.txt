Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is used to conditionally generate logic based on the constants `USE_MEMORY_BLOCKS` and `EMPTY_LATENCY`. This technique is used to customize hardware designs depending on configurational parameters. If the `USE_MEMORY_BLOCKS` constant equals `1`, then the code inside `gen_blk9` is generated. Furthermore, when `EMPTY_LATENCY` equals `1`, another set of logic under `gen_blk10` is instantiated. These generate constructions allow for flexible design definition that can be changed at compile time.
