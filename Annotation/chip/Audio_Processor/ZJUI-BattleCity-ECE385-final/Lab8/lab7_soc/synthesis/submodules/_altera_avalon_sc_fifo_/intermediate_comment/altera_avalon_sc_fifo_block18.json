    "block_comment": "This Verilog block serves as an initializer for the \"fill_level\" variable. Its implementation is fairly straightforward. Specifically, an \"always\" block is used which is sensitive to all changes, meaning it will execute at any change in the inputs. The code simply sets the \"fill_level\" to zero, essentially resetting this variable to its initial state regardless of any previous changes."
