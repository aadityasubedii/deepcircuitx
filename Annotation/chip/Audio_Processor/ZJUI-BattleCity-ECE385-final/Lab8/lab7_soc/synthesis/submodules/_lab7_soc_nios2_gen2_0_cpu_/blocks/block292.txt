This block of code implements a multiplexer (mux) for a FIFO buffer with four input signals: itm, overflow_pending_atm, overflow_pending_dtm, and fifo_wrptr_plus1, and it is based on the writing pointer (fifo_wrptr) condition and the validity of itm, atm, and dtm signals. The mux outputs itm if the pointer is at position 4 and itm is valid, and outputs overflow_pending_atm or overflow_pending_dtm if fifo_wrptr is at position 4 and atm or dtm is valid respectively. When the pointer plus one equals 4 and ge2_free & itm_valid & atm_valid or itm_valid & dtm_valid are true, it returns overflow_pending_atm or overflow_pending_dtm. In other scenarios, it defaults to overflow_pending_dtm.
