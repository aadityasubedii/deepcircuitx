This block responds to edge-triggered changes due to a clock pulse or a reset signal in a memory utilization subroutine. During a reset event, it zeroes out the `mem_used[i]` cell to represent no memory usage. In the absence of a reset, a memory state change is being assessed, marked by either a write or read action, but not both simultaneously. If it's a write event, the current memory usage `mem_used[i]` inherits the prior value `mem_used[i-1]` implying a cascading effect. Conversely, a read event implies it inherits the next memory cell's value `mem_used[i+1]`, suggesting shifting memory use forward.
