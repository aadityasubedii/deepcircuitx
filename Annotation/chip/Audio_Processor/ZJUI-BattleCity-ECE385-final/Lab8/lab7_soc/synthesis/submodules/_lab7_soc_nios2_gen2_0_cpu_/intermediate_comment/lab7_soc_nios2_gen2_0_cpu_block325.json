    "block_comment": "This block of code declares a 3-bit control wire 'ctrl_bits_for_mux'. This is often intended for controlling a multiplexer. The 3-bit variable 'ctrl_bits_for_mux' will be used to select one of several input lines (up to 8), and route that chosen input into a single output line, following a typical multiplexer operation. This Verilog code allows for dynamic control of a multiplexer logic in a hardware circuit."
