    "block_comment": "This block of code is a triggered register update which uses the positive edge of a clock signal or the negative edge of a reset signal as triggers. If a reset condition occurs (reset_n equals to 0), the signed load control register (R_ctrl_ld_signed) will be set to zero, effectively resetting it. If that's not the case and the enable signal (R_en) is high, then the register will be updated by the next value (R_ctrl_ld_signed_nxt) at the next clock pulse, essentially allowing or blocking the update of the register based on the enable signal."
