Comment: 
The block of code is used to process and synchronize reset signals based on given conditions. If there are no designated output reset synchronization edges (`OUTPUT_RESET_SYNC_EDGES` == "none") and no reset requests present (`RESET_REQUEST_PRESENT==0`), the block simply assigns `merged_reset` to `reset_out_pre` and `merged_reset_req_in` to `reset_req_pre`. However, if either of these conditions is not met, the block uses `altera_reset_synchronizer` module twice. The first instance synchronizes the merged reset signal based on the clock signal, whereas the second instance does the same for the merged reset request signal. The asynchronous reset parameter in the first synchronizer is dependent on whether a reset request is present.
