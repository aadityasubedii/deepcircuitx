This block is responsible for assigning the output of a bit-wise OR operation to the `D_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot` signal. This operation involves four signals: `D_op_roli`, `D_op_slli`, `D_op_srli`, and `D_op_srai`. Each of these signals represents a different shift or rotate instruction (rotate left, shift left, shift right logical, and shift right arithmetic respectively). If any of these signals is high (indicating that the corresponding operation is to be performed), the `D_ctrl_src_imm5_shift_rot` signal is set high.
