    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code controls the forward progression and error handling of address signal processing in a hardware design. The `ok_to_forward` is arranged to signify safe forwarding, while `drop_on_error` negates the dropping of data even in the presence of an error. Depending on the width of the address (`ADDR_WIDTH`), `curr_sop_ptr` is assigned either the minimum value of 1'b0 or a zero-padded version of the address, accommodating address widths greater than one."
