Comment: 
This block of code selects the data to be loaded into a particular location of a FIFO memory during a write operation. The decision logic is based on various conditions, including the current write pointer position, the status of the input data, and specific overflow conditions. If the FIFO write pointer is at location 11 and data from itm, overflow_pending_atm, or overflow_pending_dtm is valid, that data is selected. For the next write position, if multiple data inputs are valid and the ge2_free condition is satisfied, priority is given to overflow_pending_atm and overflow_pending_dtm data inputs. If no conditions are satisfied, overflow_pending_dtm is selected by default.
