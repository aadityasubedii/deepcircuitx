    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a generate-if construct based on the condition of a reset value (`rst_value`) and a depth value (`depth`). If the `rst_value` is equal to 1 and `depth` is less than 3, then the subsequent code block enclosed within the begin-end statement will be executed. As a part of the hardware description, this conditional statement helps define the behavior of the design in response to certain conditions. It's part of a generate construct used for creating several instances of code or modules based on a controlling parameter."
