    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a sequentially sensitive block that resets or updates a FIFO register. On the negative edge of the 'reset_n' signal, this block resets the 'fifo_7' register to zero, thereby clearing any previous data. It also responds to the positive edge of the clock ('clk') signal, where if the 'fifo_7_enable' is high, the value of 'fifo_7' is updated to the value of 'fifo_7_mux'. This enables conditional data loading into the FIFO."
