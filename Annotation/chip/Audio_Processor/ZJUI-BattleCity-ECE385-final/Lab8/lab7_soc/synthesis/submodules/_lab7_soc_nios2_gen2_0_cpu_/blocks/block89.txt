This is a resettable and clock-sensitive register block. It listens for a positive edge of the clock or a negative edge of the reset signal. If the reset signal is asserted (low), the register 'R_ctrl_rot_right' is reset to '0'. However, if the reset is in a non-asserted state and the signal 'R_en' is high, the value of the next state 'R_ctrl_rot_right_nxt' is latched into 'R_ctrl_rot_right' at the next positive clock edge.
