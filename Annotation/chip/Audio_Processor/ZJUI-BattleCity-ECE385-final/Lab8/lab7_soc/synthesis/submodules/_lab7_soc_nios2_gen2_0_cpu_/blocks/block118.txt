Comment: 
This block is responsible for updating the register `R_ctrl_implicit_dst_retaddr`. It does this synchronously with the rising edge of the clock signal `clk` or the falling edge of the active-low reset signal `reset_n`. On the falling edge of `reset_n`, `R_ctrl_implicit_dst_retaddr` is reset to zero. But when `reset_n` is not asserted, if the enable signal `R_en` is high, the next state value `R_ctrl_implicit_dst_retaddr_nxt` is latched into `R_ctrl_implicit_dst_retaddr` at the next positive clock edge.
