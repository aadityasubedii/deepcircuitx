This block of code is a memory controller for a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer. The memory controller operates on a rising edge of a clock or a reset signal. If a reset signal is detected, the controller empties the buffer by setting its memory usage to 0. In normal operation, the controller checks if there is a write or a read operation. If a write operation occurs, it updates the memory used byte to the last memory byte used. If a read operation occurs, it doesn't change the memory usage to ensure the correct data is read next.
