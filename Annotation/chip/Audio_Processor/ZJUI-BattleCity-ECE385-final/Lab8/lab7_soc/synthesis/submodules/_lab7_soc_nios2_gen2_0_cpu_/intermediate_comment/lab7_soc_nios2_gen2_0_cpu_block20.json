    "block_comment": "This block handles reset and update operations for control ignore destination register (R_ctrl_ignore_dst) in synchronous digital circuits. Upon encountering a negative edge of reset signal (reset_n), it sets the value of R_ctrl_ignore_dst register to 0, effectively initializing it. In case of a positive edge clock signal (clk) and when the R_en enable signal is high, the register R_ctrl_ignore_dst gets updated with the value of R_ctrl_ignore_dst_nxt, which could be a staged or newly computed value. This behavior ensures the register either gets reset or updated at each clock cycle, based on the control signals."
