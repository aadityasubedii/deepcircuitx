Comment: 
The block is responsible for maintaining and updating a high immediate control register (`R_ctrl_hi_imm16`) in a digital circuit based on the clock (`clk`) and reset (`reset_n`) signals. When the reset signal is active (low), the register is reset to zero. When the clock signal has a rising edge (positive edge) and `R_en` is set, the register value is updated to equal the next immediate control value (`R_ctrl_hi_imm16_nxt`). No change occurs on other clock stages or if the `R_en` signal is not active.
