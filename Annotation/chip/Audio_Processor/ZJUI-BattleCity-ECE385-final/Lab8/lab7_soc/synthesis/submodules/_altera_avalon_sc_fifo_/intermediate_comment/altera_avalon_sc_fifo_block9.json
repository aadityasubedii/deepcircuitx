    "block_comment": "This block of code implements the logic for Read-Only CSR (Control Status Register). When there's a rising edge on the reset signal, this block will clear `csr_readdata` indicating no data is present. If there's a rising edge on clock and `csr_read` signal is asserted, the code sets `csr_readdata` again to zero initially and then populates it conditionally based on the `csr_address`. If `csr_address` is zero, the data consists of `fill_level` value appended with leading zeroes to match the required address width. This design allows dynamic updating of read data with the only address value currently supported being zero."
