    "block_comment": "This block of code is a part of a FIFO (First In First Out) memory buffer implemented in Verilog. It handles reset conditions, data writing, and data reading from the FIFO buffer. Upon reset, it sets the state of all registers to known values. During the positive edge of the clock (clk), if no reset signal (rst_n) is active, it updates the state of the buffer including write overflow and read valid flags based on various conditions. It also handles the activity of the AE and AF indicators. When receiving write or read requests (av_write_n, av_read_n) together with a chipselect signal, it performs data write into the buffer or sets flags to acknowledge read validity. The write or read operations are determined by the 'av_address'. For the write operation, it utilizes av_writedata[0] and av_writedata[1] for ien_AF and ien_AE states respectively. For read, it checks whether the FIFO is empty (fifo_EF) and acknowledges the read operation."
