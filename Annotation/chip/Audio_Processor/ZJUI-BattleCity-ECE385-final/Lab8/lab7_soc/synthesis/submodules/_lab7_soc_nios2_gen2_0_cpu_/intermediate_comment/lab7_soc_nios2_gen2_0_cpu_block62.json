    "block_comment": "The block of code is a hardware description for a register (R_ctrl_br) that can be reset asynchronously and updated synchronously. The operation of the module depends on the control signals, reset_n and R_en. On a falling edge of reset_n (i.e., when reset_n hat is set to zero), the R_ctrl_br register is reset, returning its output to a known default state (logic low). At the rising edge of the clock signal (clk) when the R_en signal is logic high, the register is updated to the value stored in R_ctrl_br_nxt."
