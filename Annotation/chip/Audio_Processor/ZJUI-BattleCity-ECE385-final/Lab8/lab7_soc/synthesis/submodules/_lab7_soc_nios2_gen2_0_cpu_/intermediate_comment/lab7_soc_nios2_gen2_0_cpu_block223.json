    "block_comment": "This block initializes a custom Nios II Gen 2 System-On-Chip (SoC) module, handling memory operations. It connects interface signals to relevant input-output ports, with signals such as address, byteenable, clock signals, debugaccess, read and write operations, reset request, and waitrequest. It also controls actions through signals 'take_action_ocimem_a', 'take_action_ocimem_b' and 'take_no_action_ocimem_a', suggesting control over multiple memory operations. The 'trigout' signal is assigned as the OR of 'dbrk_trigout' and 'xbrk_trigout', indicating a trigger event when either one is active."
