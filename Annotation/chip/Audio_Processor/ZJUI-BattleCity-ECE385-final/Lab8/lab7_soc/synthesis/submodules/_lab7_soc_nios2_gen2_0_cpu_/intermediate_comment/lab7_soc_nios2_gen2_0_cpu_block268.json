    "block_comment": "This block is a reset and enable controller for the FIFO_13 register in a digital system. The block is sensitive to positive edge of the clock signal and negative edge of the reset_n signal. If reset_n drops from 1 to 0, the FIFO register (fifo_13) is reset to 0, essentially clearing it. If the enable (fifo_13_enable) goes high, the output of the FIFO (fifo_13) follows the fifo_13_mux signal."
