    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for assigning a value to the 'fifo_7_mux' signal based on several conditions. It makes use of conditional operators to check the conditions related to the 'fifo_wrptr', 'fifo_wrptr_plus1', 'itm_valid', 'atm_valid', and 'dtm_valid' signals. If 'fifo_wrptr' equals 7 and any of 'itm_valid', 'atm_valid', or 'dtm_valid' signal is true, 'fifo_7_mux' is assigned the respective overflow signal. Alternatively, it checks if 'fifo_wrptr_plus1' equals 7 and if any two of the validation signals ('itm_valid', 'atm_valid', and 'dtm_valid') and 'ge2_free' are true, then the respective overflow signal is assigned. If all conditions fail, 'overflow_pending_dtm' is assigned to 'fifo_7_mux'."
