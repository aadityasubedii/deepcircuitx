    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is for instantiating and driving an Altera Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) unit specifically for SDRAM operations in a System on Chip (SoC) design. The block essentially creates a PLL ('sd1') based on 'lab7_soc_sdram_pll_altpll_lqa2'. A reset signal for this PLL is derived by ORing the 'w_pll_areset_in' and 'areset' signals, and it uses the 'clk' signal for its input clock. It propagates the 'wire_sd1_clk' signal through the 'clk' IO and updates the 'locked' state with 'wire_sd1_locked'. The functionality of this block is mainly used for generating a stable clock source for SDRAM operations and maintaining the synchronization within the SoC system."
