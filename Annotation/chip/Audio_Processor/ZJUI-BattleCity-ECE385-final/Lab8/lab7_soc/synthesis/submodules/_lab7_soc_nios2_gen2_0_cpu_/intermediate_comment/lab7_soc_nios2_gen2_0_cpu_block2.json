    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a conditional assignment operation. Depending on the type of opcode, it assigns the related hexadecimal value to `F_inst` variable. This allocation of specific hex values to `F_inst` for distinct operation cases is accomplished by cascading the ternary operator. The different conditions in their order of appearance identify an operation instruction like calling a function, jump if equal, multiplication, division etc. If none of these operation codes match, a default hex value, corresponding to a BAD operation, will be assigned to `F_inst`."
