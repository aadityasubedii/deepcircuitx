    "block_comment": "The block provides a read/write mechanism to access the JTAG module's RAM and configure the system based on active low reset, data output and specific take-action flags generated by other parts of the system. This block of Verilog code is primarily event-driven, triggered by the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the jrst_n signal. It runs initialization routines if jrst_n indicates a reset. Otherwise, it performs specific manipulations of register content based on various conditions ('take_no_action_ocimem_a', 'take_action_ocimem_a', 'take_action_ocimem_b'), enabling read/write operations to the JTAG RAM and maintaining memory access accordingly. It also manages 'waitrequest' and 'avalon_ociram_readdata_ready' based on the read or write conditions, ensuring synchrony with the Avalon interface."
