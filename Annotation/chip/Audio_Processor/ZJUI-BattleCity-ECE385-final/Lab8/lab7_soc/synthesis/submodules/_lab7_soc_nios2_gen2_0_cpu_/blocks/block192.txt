Comment: 
This block of code implements a flip-flop memory element for storing the destination register number (`D_dst_regnum`) in a pipelined Verilog design. Upon a falling edge of the active-low reset signal (`reset_n`), the stored register number (`R_dst_regnum`) resets to zero. During every positive edge of the clock cycle (`clk`), if the `reset_n` is not asserted, the block latches the input value (`D_dst_regnum`) into the flip-flop storage (`R_dst_regnum`), effectively implementing a register transfer level (RTL) latch for the pipeline stage.
