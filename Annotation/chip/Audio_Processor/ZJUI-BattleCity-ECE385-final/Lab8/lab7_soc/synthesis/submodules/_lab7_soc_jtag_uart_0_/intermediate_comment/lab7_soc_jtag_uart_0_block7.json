    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the 8 least significant bits of the \"av_writedata\" to \"fifo_wdata\". This is consistent with a technique of data extraction, commonly exercised in data communication systems, which deals with specific bits of data. Here, the range [7 : 0] specifies the manipulation of the lower 8 bits from \"av_writedata\"."
