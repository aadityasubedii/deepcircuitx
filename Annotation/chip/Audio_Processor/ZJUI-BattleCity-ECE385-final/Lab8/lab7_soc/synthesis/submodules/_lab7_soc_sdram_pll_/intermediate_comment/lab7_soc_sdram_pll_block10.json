    "block_comment": "This block of code represents the initial definition of a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) module specific to a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) in an SoC (System on Chip). The module includes several input and output connections, such as address, reset signals, clock signals, config update signals, read and write commands, and data lines. Functionally, this module is implemented to manage timing and synchronization issues pertaining to the interaction with the SDRAM, such as maintaining the phase relationship between the input and output signals through a feedback loop mechanism. It does this by asserting control signals like phasedone, phaseupdown, and phasecounterselect based on inputs and the internals of the PLL to synchronize the SDRAM operations with the SoC system clock."
