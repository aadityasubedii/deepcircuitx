    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to respond to changes in two signals: the positive edge of a clock signal (clk) and the negative edge of a reset signal (reset_n). If the reset signal is set to 0, the block does nothing. But if the second condition that combines the `W_valid` and `R_wr_dst_reg` flags is true, it will check the parity of `R_dst_regnum`. If `R_dst_regnum` is undefined ('x'), an error message will be written and simulation will stop. This is an error-detecting setup usually used in testbenches to validate the system behavior and catch any abnormalities during the simulation."
