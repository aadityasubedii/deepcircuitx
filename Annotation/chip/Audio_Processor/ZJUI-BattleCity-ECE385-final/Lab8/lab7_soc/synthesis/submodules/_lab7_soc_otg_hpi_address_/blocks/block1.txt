This block of code is responsible for assigning a data signal to an output port. The implementation detail involves a simple continuous assignment statement in Verilog, which links a wire (`out_port`) to some data (`data_out`). The 'assign' keyword is used to perform this operation, making `out_port` equal to `data_out`, and any change in `data_out` is directly reflected at `out_port`.
