    "module": "Module-level comment: The lab7_soc_keycode module performs read and write operations in a system. It uses addresses and control signals chipselect and write_n to latch the LSB of the write operation input data writedata into an 8-bit register data_out, synchronized with the clock. The data forwarded to the output out_port mirrors the contents of data_out. The read data is either '0' (when address is non-zero) or the 8-bit latched data (when address is zero), mirrored to a full 32-bits. A low signal on reset_n asynchronously resets the register."
