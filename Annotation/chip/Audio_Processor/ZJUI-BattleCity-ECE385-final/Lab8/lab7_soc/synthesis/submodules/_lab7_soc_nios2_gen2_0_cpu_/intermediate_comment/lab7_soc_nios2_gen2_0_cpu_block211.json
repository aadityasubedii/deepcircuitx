    "block_comment": "This block of code deals with the operation of Program Counter (PC) in a pipelined microprocessor design using a flip-flop. During a negative edge of reset (meaning when reset goes from high to low), the PC is reset and set to 67108864. And at the rising edge of the clock, if 'F_pc_en' is set (which indicates that the next PC is ready), the PC value is updated with the value of 'F_pc_nxt'. Consequently, this block effectively directs execution flow in the microprocessor."
