    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines the interface for a hardware module named lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_nios2_oci_xbrk. The functionality of this module is to provide the necessary controls, signaling and synchronization mechanisms for the Nios II embedded processor. The interface consists of inputs for data validation (D_valid, E_valid), program counter (F_pc), clock (clk), asynchronous reset (reset_n), various trigger states, and control flags (xbrk_ctrl0, xbrk_ctrl1, xbrk_ctrl2, xbrk_ctrl3). In terms of outputs, the interface provides several signals: xbrk_break to indicate a breakpoint, two signals xbrk_goto0 and xbrk_goto1 for conditional jump or branch instructions, xbrk_traceoff and xbrk_traceon for toggling trace mode, and xbrk_trigout as a trigger output."
