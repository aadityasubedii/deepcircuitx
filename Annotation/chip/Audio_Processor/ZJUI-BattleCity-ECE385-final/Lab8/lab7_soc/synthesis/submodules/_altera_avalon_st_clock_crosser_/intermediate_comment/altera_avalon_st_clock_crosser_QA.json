In designs where different modules run on different clock domains, this module helps in transferring valid data across two clock zones safely to avoid metastability or glitches. Data traveling from one clock zone to another is captured and synchronized to reduce the chance of a clock event (rising edge or falling edge) occurring during a metastable state.
