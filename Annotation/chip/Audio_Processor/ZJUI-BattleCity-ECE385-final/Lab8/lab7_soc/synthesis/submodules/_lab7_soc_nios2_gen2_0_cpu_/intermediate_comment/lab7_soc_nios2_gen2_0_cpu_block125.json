    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of `D_ctrl_jmp_indirect` to `R_ctrl_jmp_indirect_nxt`. It is a non-blocking assignment operation which means that the assignment will take place after all the RTL (Register transfer level) updates are complete in the current simulation timestep. This block might be part of a sequential logic design wherein, the value of `D_ctrl_jmp_indirect` is likely to be updated in the subsequent cycle."
