    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for reading and writing data to a register file. It assigns previously latched data (R_rf_a_q and R_rf_b_q) to the read ports R_rf_a and R_rf_b. It determines whether the write enable of the register file (W_rf_wren) is triggered based on whether data is valid for writing (R_wr_dst_reg & W_valid), whether there's any valid ECC check (W_rf_ecc_valid_any), or whether the system is not in reset mode (~reset_n). Lastly, it manages the data to be written (W_rf_wr_data) by choosing either an aligned and filtered load data (av_ld_data_aligned_filtered) when the control signal for load (R_ctrl_ld) is active, or previously determined write data (W_wr_data) otherwise."
