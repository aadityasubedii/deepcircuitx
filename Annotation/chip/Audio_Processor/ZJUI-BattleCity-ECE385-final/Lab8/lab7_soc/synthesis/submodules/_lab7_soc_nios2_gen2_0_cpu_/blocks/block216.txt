Comment: 
The function of this block is to conditionally output data based on the state of input signals. This block gets triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal or falling edge of the `jrst_n` signal. If `jrst_n` is `0`, `readdata` is set to `0`. Otherwise, it checks the 9th bit of the `address` line and, based on whether it's high or low, it assigns the corresponding value from either the `oci_reg_readdata` or `ociram_readdata` to `readdata`.
