    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code refers to a non-blocking assignment. Specifically, it signifies that the next state of the signal 'R_ctrl_ld_non_io' is same as the current state of 'D_ctrl_ld_non_io'. This operation is typically used within sequential logic, like at the output of a flip-flop at the rising edge of a clock cycle. The non-blocking assignment allows for simultaneous updates of 'R_ctrl_ld_non_io' and 'D_ctrl_ld_non_io', preventing data hazards and ensuring consistent functionality. The statement is synchronous with the clock in a typical sequencer."
