Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code assigns the 'fifo_head' with the value of 'fifo_read_mux'. This assignment operation implies that 'fifo_head' acts as a placeholder for the data read from the FIFO through the multiplexer 'fifo_read_mux'. The implementation of this line is done using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog which is used for continuous assignments. It establishes a connectivity between 'fifo_head' and 'fifo_read_mux' in the design, implying that 'fifo_head' will hold the latest data read from FIFO. The 'fifo_head' can then be used in the subsequent RTL code for further processing of this data.
