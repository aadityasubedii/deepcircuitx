    "block_comment": "This block basically multiplexes data into a FIFO at position 14 based on several conditions or signals. The first condition inspected is whether the FIFO write pointer is at position 14 and whether an `itm_valid` signal is detected. If this is true, then `itm` is assigned to `fifo_14_mux`. If not, it checks whether `atm_valid` or `dtm_valid` signals are present with FIFO write pointer at 14; if so, relevant data pointed by these signals will be assigned. For the rest conditions, similar checks are conducted but with `fifo_wrptr_plus1` (the next position of FIFO write pointer) and an additional condition of `ge2_free` (which likely indicates availability of two or more free spots). Depending on which conditions match, `atm` or `dtm` data is assigned to `fifo_14_mux`. If none of the conditions pass, `overflow_pending_dtm` is the default assigned to `fifo_14_mux`."
