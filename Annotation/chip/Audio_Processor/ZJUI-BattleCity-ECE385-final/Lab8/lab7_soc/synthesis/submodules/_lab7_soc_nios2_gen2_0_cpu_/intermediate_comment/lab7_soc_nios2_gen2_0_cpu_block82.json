    "block_comment": "This block asserts the `D_ctrl_logic` signal if any of the control operation signals are active. This is accomplished by performing a logical OR operation among ten different control operation signals (`D_op_and`, `D_op_or`, `D_op_xor`, `D_op_nor`, `D_op_andhi`, `D_op_orhi`, `D_op_xorhi`, `D_op_andi`, `D_op_ori`, `D_op_xori`). Thus, if any of these signals are true(high), the `D_ctrl_logic` signal will also be true."
