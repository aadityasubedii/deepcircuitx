This block of code is used to instantiate the lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_ociram_sp_ram module that serves as a Special-Purpose (SP) Read-Only Memory (Ram) for a Nios II Gen 2 CPU. The module functions by mapping input and output signals for read and write operations. It uses 'ociram_addr' for address identification, 'ociram_byteenable' for selecting byte for operation, 'clk' as its clock signal, 'ociram_wr_data' for write data, 'ociram_readdata' as output for read data and 'ociram_reset_req' for innitiating reset command. The 'ociram_wr_en' is used to enable writing operation to the RAM.
