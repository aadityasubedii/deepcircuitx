This block of code processes a synchronous reset and the updating of a count using a clock signal. When the reset signal 'reset_n' is active low, the count 'E_shift_rot_cnt' is set to zero. Following this, when the clock signal 'clk' arises, 'E_shift_rot_cnt' updates to 'E_shift_rot_cnt_nxt'. This block forms the basic construct for a synchronous counter with reset functionality.
