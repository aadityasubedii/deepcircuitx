    "module": "Module-level comment: \"The 'lab7_soc_jtag_uart_0' is an onboard communication SoC module, primarily tasked with data exchange managed via multiple input/output ports and signals. It employs sub-modules 'lab7_soc_jtag_uart_0_scfifo_w' and 'lab7_soc_jtag_uart_0_scfifo_r' for handling data writing and reading operations, with additional operations pertaining to interrupt activation and data availability control. Uses clock ('clk') and reset ('rst_n') signals to synchronize and control procedures. Internal signals are utilized to track data transfer processes, handle exceptions, and manage FIFO buffer, preventing both overflow and underflow.\"\n"
