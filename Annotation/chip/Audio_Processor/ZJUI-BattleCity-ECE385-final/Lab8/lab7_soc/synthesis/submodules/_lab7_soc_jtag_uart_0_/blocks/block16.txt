Comment: 
This block in Verilog does a few things. Firstly, it defines a 32-bit register labeled as 'bytes_left'. This will be used to store and manipulate a 32-bit data. Secondly, it also declares an unassigned wire 'fifo_EF'. This wire would be used as an input/output port for transmitting signals. Finally, it specifies another register 'fifo_rd_d' which is not yet assigned to any bits. The functionality and the amount of bits this register will have, will be determined in blocks of codes that follow this one.
