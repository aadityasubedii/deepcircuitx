Comment: 
These blocks of verilog code form part of a clocked register system, specifically these blocks function as resettable registers. On a rising edge of the clock or a falling edge of reset_n, registers 'W_estatus_reg', 'W_bstatus_reg', 'W_ienable_reg', 'W_ipending_reg', and 'W_cdsr_reg' are reset to 0 if 'reset_n' is low. If it is high, then the registers maintain the value of their corresponding 'next' registers as specified by '_nxt'. The 'W_cpuid_reg' and 'W_wr_data_non_zero' are set by direct assignments, independent of clock or resets.
