    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is performing an assignment operation. The function of the block is to transfer the value of the signal `D_ctrl_mem32` to `R_ctrl_mem32_nxt` at every positive edge of the clock. The applied implementation method is by using an `assign` keyword which denotes continuous assignment, making the `R_ctrl_mem32_nxt` signal reflect any changes in `D_ctrl_mem32` instantaneously."
