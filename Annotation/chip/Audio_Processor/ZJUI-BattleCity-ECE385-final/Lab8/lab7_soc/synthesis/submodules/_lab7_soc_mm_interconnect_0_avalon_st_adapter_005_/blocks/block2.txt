This block of code in Verilog acts as an error handler. When the module is instantiated with incorrect parameters, this block will execute. It employs system tasks: $display and $stop, for this purpose. The $display system task prints out the error message specifying that the module was instantiated with wrong parameters, and the $stop task halts the simulation, stopping the further execution of the module's code.
