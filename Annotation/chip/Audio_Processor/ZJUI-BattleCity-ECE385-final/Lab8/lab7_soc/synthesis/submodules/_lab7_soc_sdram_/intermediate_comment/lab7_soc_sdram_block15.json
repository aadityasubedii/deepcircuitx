    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the refresh request signal within a digital circuit. Under the control of a clock signal, an 'if-else' structure is used to seamlessly handle the states of refresh_request. When reset_n is 0, that is, when a reset signal is received, the block sets the refresh_request to 0, essentially clearing any pending refresh requests. On the other hand, it sets the refresh_request under specific conditions when reset_n is not 0 (indicating no reset is requested). These conditions comprise a logical operation involving refresh_counter, ack_refresh_request, and the init_done signal. This ensures the refresh request is made only when necessary and allows for an optimal refresh operation within the system."
