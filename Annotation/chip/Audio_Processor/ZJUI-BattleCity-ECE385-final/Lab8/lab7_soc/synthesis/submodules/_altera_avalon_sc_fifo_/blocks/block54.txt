Comment: 
This block of code describes a memory write and read operation that occurs synchronously on a clock's positive edge. If the `in_valid` and `in_ready` signals are both asserted, it writes an `in_payload` into the memory at the address specified by `wr_ptr`. In the same clock cycle, it reads data from the memory at an address specified by `mem_rd_ptr` and assigns it to `internal_out_payload`.
