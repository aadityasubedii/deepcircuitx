    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the signal 'E_valid_from_R' based on the system clock (clk) and reset (reset_n) signals. Upon the rising edge of the clock or falling edge of the reset signal, if the reset signal is asserted (low), it sets 'E_valid_from_R' to zero ensuring a clean state. However, if the reset signal is not asserted (high), 'E_valid_from_R' takes the logical OR value of 'R_valid' and 'E_stall', thereby updating its state based on the status of R-stage completion ('R_valid') or possible stall conditions ('E_stall')."
