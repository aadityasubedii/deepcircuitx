    "block_comment": "This block of code defines an output signal called 'td_mode' in Verilog. The signal is a 4-bit bus, as specified by the bit-width declaration '[3: 0]'. Hence, 'td_mode' could represent 16 different states from 0 to 15. This implementation is often used for indicating modes or states for different working conditions on a bus line."
