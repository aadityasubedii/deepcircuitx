    "block_comment": "This block of code establishes the functionality of a register `W_bstatus_reg` which is sensitive to both the positive edge of the clock signal `clk` and the negative edge of the asynchronous reset `reset_n`. When the `reset_n` signal is low (0), this resets `W_bstatus_reg` to 0, ensuring a defined state for the register at startup. However, if `reset_n` is not in a reset state, the value of `W_bstatus_reg` gets updated with the next value `W_bstatus_reg_nxt` on each rising clock edge, thus enabling the storage and update of binary state values."
