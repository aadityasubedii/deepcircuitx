This block implements a reset function and an error detection logic for an ECC (Error Correction Code) mechanism in a register file. Upon a negative edge of the reset signal, it resets the validity of an ECC unrecoverable error. On every positive clock edge, if reset is not active, it updates the signal to reflect whether an ECC unrecoverable error has occurred, unless a recoverable ECC error has also been triggered. The block is using edge-triggered logic to ensure synchronous operation.
