    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code decides when to enable a particular FIFO block, particularly the sixth one, which is indicated by 'fifo_6_enable'. The decision to enable fifo_6 is made based on certain conditions, for instance, if the write pointer is at position 6 and there is an input greater or equal to 1, or there is a free position at a greater or equal to 2, with the added condition that the incremented write pointer is at position 6, and another possible scenario involves a free position at a greater or equal to 3 along with an incremented write pointer (by 2) at position 6."
