This block of code is responsible for assigning the value of the "reset_n" signal to the "jrst_n" signal. In the Verilog code provided, it is implemented using the '=' operator, which represents direct assignment. This therefore means that anytime the "reset_n" signal changes, the "jrst_n" signal will immediately reflect that change.
