Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls the enabling of a FIFO buffer at position 12. The fifo_12_enable signal goes high if any of the three conditions are satisfied. The first condition is met when the write pointer is at position 12 and there is at least one input available. The second condition requires two inputs available and the next FIFO position (wrptr_plus1) to be at position 12, given the second extraction point is free (ge2_free). The final condition follows similar logic as the second but with three inputs and the write pointer pointing two steps ahead (wrptr_plus2) at 12, provided third extraction point (ge3_free) is free.
