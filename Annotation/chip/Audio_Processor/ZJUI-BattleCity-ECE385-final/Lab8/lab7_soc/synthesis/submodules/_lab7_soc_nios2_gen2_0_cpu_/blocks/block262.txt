The block defines the behavior of a FIFO buffer element (fifo_15) under different control signals. On the negative edge of a reset signal (reset_n), the FIFO element is cleared to 0. On the positive edge of a clock signal (clk), if the FIFO enable signal (fifo_15_enable) is high, the FIFO element updates its value from a multiplexer output (fifo_15_mux).
