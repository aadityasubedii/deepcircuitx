Just to clarify, it seems there is a misunderstanding, I am an AI model generated by OpenAI designed to provide detailed responses, but I don't see a block of code attached here that I can analyze.

But, first, let's understand the initial steps before we can generate the required mapping for Verilog RTL codes.

Initially, we process texts into tuples of inputs mapped to corresponding outputs:

INPUT: Verilog RTL codes 
OUTPUT: Generated Comments

1. **Parsing Raw Data:** First task would be to parse Verilog RTL codes. A good parser for Verilog exists such as tree-sitter.

2. **Defining the Mapping:** The mapping will be from a certain part of the code (like a function or a block of statements) to its corresponding comment. The mapping will be defined based upon how comments are structured in the dataset.

3. **Tokenization:** This involves breaking down the parsed code into smaller parts, often called "tokens." This makes it easier for the model to process.

4. **Seq2Seq Mapping:** After tokenization and creation of tuples, we define a Seq2Seq mapping of the tokens to the comments.

5. **Padding Sequences:** If we're training a deep learning model, the input sequences should have equal lengths, hence we perform padding.

We have to remember that since there's no one-size-fits-all kind of solution, these steps may vary or need modification according to the specific details in your data and the model architecture you plan to use.

After these steps, the data can be directly fed into a deep learning model for training.
