    "block_comment": "This block initiates a synchronous reset chain. It specifically assigns the fifty percent value '1' to all elements of the \"r_sync_rst_chain\" vector with length defined as ASSERTION_CHAIN_LENGTH. The equal distribution across the vector ensures that the reset chain is evenly spread throughout the target registers for a consistent and dependable synchronous reset operation."
