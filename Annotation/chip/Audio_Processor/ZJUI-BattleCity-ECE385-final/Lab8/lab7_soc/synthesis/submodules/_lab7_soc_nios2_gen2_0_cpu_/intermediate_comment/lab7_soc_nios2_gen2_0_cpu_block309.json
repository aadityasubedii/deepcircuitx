    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a FIFO (First In, First Out) read/write pointer and counter with overflow handling. On the negative edge of the 'jrst_n' signal or on a positive edge of the clock signal, the counter and both pointers are reset if 'jrst_n' is 0. This block operates under the assumption that 'jrst_n' is an active low reset signal. If 'jrst_n' isn't 0, the write pointer and counter are incremented by their respective increment values. Additionally, if the FIFO isn't empty the read pointer is incremented. There is also an 'overflow_pending' signal that is set to 1 if certain conditions are met, signifying that an overflow may occur. These conditions include if 'trc_this' is false, or input signals 'ge2_free' and 'ge3_free' are active high with their corresponding 'input_ge' signals. If 'atm_valid' or 'dtm_valid' signals are true, 'overflow_pending' is reset, which signifies that the buffer can accept new entries."
