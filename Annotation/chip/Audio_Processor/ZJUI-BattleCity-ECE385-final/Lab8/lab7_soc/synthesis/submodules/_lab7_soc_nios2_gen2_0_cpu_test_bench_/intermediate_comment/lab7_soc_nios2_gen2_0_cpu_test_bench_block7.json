    "block_comment": "This block of code manages both the write and read operations of an address on a synchronous digital system. It is activated on the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of the reset, ensuring synchronization. If a reset is triggered, the block does nothing. When either a write or read operation is signaled, it performs a binary XOR operation across all bits of the address. If the XOR result is undefined('x'), it logs an error with a timestamp and stops the operation, preventing uncertain data manipulation on the undefined address."
