    "block_comment": "This block of code represents error checking logic in a synchronous clocking environment. This block is triggered at the positive edge of the clock. If a reset command has not been sent (highlighted by the reset_n line), the code then checks the validity of the W_valid variable using XOR operation. If the W_valid variable is in an undefined ('X') state, an error message is output, showing the time when the error occurred, and the simulation is stopped."
