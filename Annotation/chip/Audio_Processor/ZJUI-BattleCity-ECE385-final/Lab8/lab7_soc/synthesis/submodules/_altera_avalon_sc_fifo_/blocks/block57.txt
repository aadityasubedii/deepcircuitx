Comment: 
This block handles data packet processing, configuring operations based on different operational modes and condition flags. These are recognized through the USE_PACKETS, ERROR_WIDTH, and CHANNEL_WIDTH flags. If USE_PACKETS is enabled, data packets are used in I/O operations; each packet combines in_packet_signals, in_data, in_data, and in_channel into a format, in_payload. This payload is then assigned to the corresponding output ports (each port being out_packet_signals, out_data, out_error, out_channel). There are exceptions for cases when ERROR_WIDTH or CHANNEL_WIDTH equal zero. If USE_PACKETS is not enabled, the block behaves similarly, but uses separate input signals instead of a packet and sets out_packet_signals to 0.
