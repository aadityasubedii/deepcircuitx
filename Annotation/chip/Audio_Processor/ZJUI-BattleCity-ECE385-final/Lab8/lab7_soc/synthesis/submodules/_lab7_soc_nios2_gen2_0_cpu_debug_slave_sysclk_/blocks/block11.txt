Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used to control if an action should be taken specifically for the OCIMEM_A. The action is controlled by a logical AND operation between `enable_action_strobe`, `ir` equating to `2'b00`. When all these conditions are true, `take_action_ocimem_a` signal is asserted to initiate the corresponding action. Apart from the comparision, no significant computational work is done in this block and it serves as a control path on the basis of `ir` and `enable_action_strobe`.
