    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a module in Verilog for a Nios II embedded processor system, utilised as an on-chip instruction memory interface, provided by the name `lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_nios2_oci_im`. This module requires several input signals such as, clock (`clk`), reset (`jrst_n`), trace control (`trc_ctrl`), and trace write (`tw`). Furthermore, the module also exhibits connections for the trace memory functionality (signified by `tracemem_on`, `tracemem_trcdata`, `tracemem_tw`) and trace logic (designated by `trc_im_addr`, `trc_wrap`, `xbrk_wrap_traceoff`). These connections are vital for control signals and data flow for high-level, concurrent, and synchronous operations."
