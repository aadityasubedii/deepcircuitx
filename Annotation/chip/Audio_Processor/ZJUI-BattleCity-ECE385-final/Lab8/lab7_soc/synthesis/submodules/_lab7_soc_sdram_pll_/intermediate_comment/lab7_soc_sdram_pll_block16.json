    "block_comment": "This block is a module of an SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory) clocking system with a cleared digital flip-flop (dff). It synchronizes incoming signals (din) to be used downstream. This is implemented using a single-bit wire 'wire_dffpipe3_q' which holds and passes the value from the 'lab7_soc_sdram_pll_dffpipe_l2c' instantiated module. The connected clock 'clk' and 'reset_n' control the synchronization, and the output 'dout' is assigned the value of the wire to pass the synchronized value forward."
