    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a control unit, specifically for managing the read and write actions in a FIFO buffer. The block reacts to two clock events, either at the positive edge of the main clock signal or the assertion of a reset signal. Upon reset, it configures the buffer's 'almost_full_threshold' to the maximum size and sets the 'almost_empty_threshold' and 'csr_readdata' to zero. During a non-reset clock event, it handles specific actions based on 'csr_read' and 'csr_write'. If 'csr_read' is asserted, it populates 'csr_readdata' based on the 'csr_address'. If 'csr_write' is asserted, it updates either the 'almost_empty_threshold' or 'almost_full_threshold' using 'csr_writedata'."
