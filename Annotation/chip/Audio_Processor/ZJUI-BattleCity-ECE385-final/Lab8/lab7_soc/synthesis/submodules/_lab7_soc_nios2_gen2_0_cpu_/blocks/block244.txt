Comment: 
This block of Verilog code initiates an interrupt enable operation. When reset is active (low), the interrupt enable register, 'oci_ienable', is set to 1. When the action corresponding to writing into an OCI interrupt mask register is accepted, the block does a bitwise OR operation between 'writedata' and the inverse of 1 following priority, updating the 'oci_ienable'.
