This block implements a simple synchronous FIFO module. It is sensitive to either a positive edge of the clock signal or a negative edge of the reset signal. On a negative reset signal, the fifo_3 module is cleared, otherwise while the fifo_3_enable condition is true, the data from fifo_3_mux is written into fifo_3 at each clock cycle.
