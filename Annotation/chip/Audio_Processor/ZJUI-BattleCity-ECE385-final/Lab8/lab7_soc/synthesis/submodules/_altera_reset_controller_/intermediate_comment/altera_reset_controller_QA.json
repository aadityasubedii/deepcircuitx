It takes multiple reset signals and reset requests, synchronizes them, and combines them into a single, de-bounced, and edge-detectable reset signal, which is then output to the rest of the FPGA design. The behavior of the reset signal depends on the parameters given to the module. These parameters include the number of reset inputs, use of reset requests, sync depth, reset request wait time, minimum reset assertion time, etc. The generated reset signal is safer to use than the raw input reset signals because it has been synchronized and de-bounced to avoid instability caused by signal metastability in digital circuits. This module also supports additional functions such as early deassertion and reset requests."

The module combines these reset signals into a single, de-bounced, and edge-detectable output reset signal.\n2. reset_req_in[0-15] - These ports accept reset request signals. If the parameter values indicate to use these reset request signals, then the reset request signals are factored in during output reset signal generation.\n3. clk - This is the clock signal input. The synchronization of the reset signals is done based on this clock signal.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. reset_out - This port outputs the processed reset signal that is synchronized, de-bounced and edge-detectable. It can be directly used by other parts of the FPGA design.\n2. reset_req - This port outputs a combined and synchronized reset request signal. This signal indicates whether a reset is requested or not.\n\nExplanation:\nThe input ports accept multiple reset and reset request signals along with the clock. The module processes these signals, synchronizes them according to the clock signal, de-bounces them, and combines them into a single reset signal. This processed signal is then outputted via the 'reset_out' output port. Simultaneously, a reset request signal indicating whether or not a reset is requested is outputted via the 'reset_req' output port. The output signals ensure safer use in rest of the design due to their synchronized and de-bounced characteristics."
