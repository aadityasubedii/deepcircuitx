    "module": "Module-level comment: Module 'lab7_soc_otg_hpi_address' is a NOT gated write control that performs write operations to a data register (data_out) during an active 'chipselect' and 'write_n', and zero address signal. Inputs decide the write condition and outputs mirror the current data or return the masked data. Internally, the module uses a bitwise AND operation for mux output and writes to 'data_out' when clock edge rises or 'reset_n' falls. The implementation is in a synchronous design style offering a reset functionality for 'data_out'."
