    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code implements a register with asynchronous reset and synchronous control update. At the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal, it checks if it's a reset or control state update. If 'reset_n' is zero (indicating presence of reset signal), it resets 'R_ctrl_crst' to zero. Else if 'R_en' is enabled, 'R_ctrl_crst' gets updated with the next state 'R_ctrl_crst_nxt' on the clock's positive edge."
