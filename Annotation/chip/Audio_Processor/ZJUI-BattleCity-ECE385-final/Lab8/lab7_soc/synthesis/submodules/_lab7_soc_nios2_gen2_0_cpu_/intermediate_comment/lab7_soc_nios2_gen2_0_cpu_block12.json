    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning the next state to `R_ctrl_intr_inst_nxt`. The implementation is quite straightforward; the next state is simply being taken from current state `D_ctrl_intr_inst`. The `assign` statement allows continuous assignment of the value from `D_ctrl_intr_inst` to `R_ctrl_intr_inst_nxt`, keeping both variables in sync throughout the code execution. This implies that any changes to `D_ctrl_intr_inst` are immediately reflected in `R_ctrl_intr_inst_nxt`."
