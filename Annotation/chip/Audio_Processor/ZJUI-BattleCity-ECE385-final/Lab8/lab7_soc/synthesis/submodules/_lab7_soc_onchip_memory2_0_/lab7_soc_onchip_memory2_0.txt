Module-level comment: The 'lab7_soc_onchip_memory2_0' module implements a single-port synchronous RAM with Altera's 'altsyncram'. Input controls involve 'write', 'chipselect' for writing data, and 'clken', 'reset' for clocking and resetting RAM. Data writing into and reading from the RAM is managed by 'writedata' and 'readdata' respectively. The location and volume of data transfer are steered by 'address' and 'byteenable'. The actual read, write operations and clock enabling are controlled by internal signals 'wren', 'readdata' and 'clocken0' which are linked to the external inputs. The RAM parameters are set using Altera's structure.
