The block of Verilog code assigns the next state of the write control signal for some controller (R_ctrl_wrctl_inst_nxt) to be equal to the current state (D_ctrl_wrctl_inst). The code implements what is likely to be part of a state machine, controlling the functions of some hardware instance by changing the state of a control signal to match the current value.
