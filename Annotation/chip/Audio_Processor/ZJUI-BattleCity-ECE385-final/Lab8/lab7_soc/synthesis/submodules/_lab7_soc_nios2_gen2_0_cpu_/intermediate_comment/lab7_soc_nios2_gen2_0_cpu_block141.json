    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is essentially a synchronous register with a reset condition. On every positive edge of the clock ('clk') or on the negative edge of the reset signal ('reset_n'), this block tests the reset condition. If the reset is active (i.e., 'reset_n' is 0), it clears the 'W_ipending_reg' register. Otherwise, it updates the 'W_ipending_reg' with the value from 'W_ipending_reg_nxt' on every clock cycle."
