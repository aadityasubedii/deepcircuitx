    "spec": "Module name: lab7_soc_sysid_qsys_0. \n\nModule specification: The lab7_soc_sysid_qsys_0 is a Verilog RTL module designed to deliver a constant value or zero, determined by the boolean level of its address input. Its operation is synchronized using a clock input and can be reset using the reset_n input. This module utilizes three primary input ports: \"address\", \"clock\", and \"reset_n\". \n\nThe module's functionality is dependent on the \"address\" input port. If the \"address\" is true, the output is the constant value \"1639598415\", otherwise, the output is \"0\". The \"clock\" input port ensures synchronization with other modules or devices within the system it operates in. The \"reset_n\" input port is used to initialize or reset the internal state of the module. \n\nIt has one output port, namely \"readdata\", which is wired internally. The \"readdata\" port's value changes based on the state of \"address\", thereby representing the output value of this module. \n\nInternally, the module uses a wire type signal named \"readdata\" for interconnecting different elements. The value of \"readdata\" is assigned based on the \"address\" input - when \"address\" is high, it holds the constant value \"1639598415\"; when \"address\" is low, it displays \"0\". \n\nThe module is devoid of multiple blocks or sections, making the entire functionality encoded in a single continuous block of logic. This logic uses a conditional assignment operation to decide the value of the \"readdata\" signal based on the state of the \"address\" port.",
