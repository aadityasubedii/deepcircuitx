    "block_comment": "This block of code produces the high part of a new program counter (PC) for a jump operation and identifies a target write address of the jumped instruction in a processor. For achieving its functionality, the first line extracts the 26th bit from the F_pc and assigns it to F_jmp_direct_pc_hi signal, treating it as the high bit of the jumped instruction's new PC. The second line concatenates F_jmp_direct_pc_hi with the 27 high bits (bit 31 to bit 6) of D_iw to form a write address of the target jump instruction, assigned to D_jmp_direct_target_waddr."
