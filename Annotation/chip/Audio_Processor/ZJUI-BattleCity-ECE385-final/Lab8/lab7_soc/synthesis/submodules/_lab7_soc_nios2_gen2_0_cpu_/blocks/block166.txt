The block of code is used for selecting appropriate data granularity based on the control signals. It is designed to work with memory of different bit size: 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit. The granularity of data is determined by control signals `D_ctrl_mem8` and `D_ctrl_mem16`. The `E_st_data` is assigned with 4 replicated `R_stb_data` when `D_ctrl_mem8` is true indicating a 8-bit memory type. It is assigned with 2 replicated `R_sth_data` when `D_ctrl_mem16` is true indicating a 16-bit memory type. If neither are true, it defaults to `R_stw_data` for a 32-bit memory. This is achieved using the conditional (ternary) operator in Verilog. This design provides flexibility to handle different word size of data.
