    "module": "Module-level comment: This module 'lab7_soc_nios2_gen2_0_cpu_debug_slave_tck' operates as a debug interface for an FPGA configured CPU. It uses a JTAG interface to communicate with an external debugger. Implementing several shift registers and synchronizers, the module handles a range of input data including breakpoints, trace memory, and JTAG states. Depending on the received instructions, different sections of the shift register are updated and synchronized accordingly. The module outputs include JTAG data out and a ready signal for the test idle state. Overall, it aids in system debugging by effectively managing data flow between internal registers and the JTAG interface."
