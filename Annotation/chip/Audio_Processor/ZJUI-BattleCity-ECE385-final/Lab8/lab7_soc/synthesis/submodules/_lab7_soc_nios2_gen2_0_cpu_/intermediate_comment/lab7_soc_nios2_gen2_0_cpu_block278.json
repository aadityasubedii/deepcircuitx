    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to fifo_9_mux based on certain conditions. It uses a cascading conditional (ternary) operator to prioritize the selection of incoming data for assignment. When the fifo_wrptr pointer is at position 9 and itm, atm, or dtm is valid data, it respectively assigns itm, overflow_pending_atm, or overflow_pending_dtm to fifo_9_mux. Additionally, if the pointer is at the next position and any two out of itm, atm, dtm are valid with ge2_free indicating available space, it assigns the overflow_pending data of atm or dtm to fifo_9_mux. If none of the described conditions is met, overflow_pending_dtm is assigned to fifo_9_mux by default."
