Module name: lab7_soc_otg_hpi_cs

Module specification: This module is a component of a system on a chip (SOC), primarily used for write data and readback operations. The module takes 'address', 'chipselect', 'clk', 'reset_n', 'write_n', and 'writedata' as inputs. 'address' is to specify the location into which data gets written. 'chipselect' is used to select the specific chip. 'clk' is the clock signal for synchronization. 'reset_n' is a signal that resets the data_out to 0 when low. 'write_n' is a signal that initiates the write operation when low. 'writedata' is the data to be written into the system. The outputs are 'out_port' and 'readdata'. 'out_port' provides the content of a data_out register. 'readdata' is used to read the contents of the 'data_out' register via a mux.

Internally, the module uses signals such as 'clk_en', 'data_out', 'read_mux_out', 'out_port', and 'readdata'. 'clk_en' is a constantly enabled signal with no apparent use. 'data_out' is the register data_out where data is written during a write operation. 'read_mux_out' is a multiplexer output that facilitates the reading of data from the 'data_out' register at a specific address. 'out_port' and 'readdata' are output ports.

The module is divided into a few key parts. Initially, a set of signals are defined and assigned values. Afterwards, a prioritized 'always' condition block checks for reset and write conditions, then assigns writedata to the 'data_out' register accordingly. Finally, the 'out_port' and 'readdata' are accordingly assigned. All operations are synchronized with the clock signal 'clk'.
