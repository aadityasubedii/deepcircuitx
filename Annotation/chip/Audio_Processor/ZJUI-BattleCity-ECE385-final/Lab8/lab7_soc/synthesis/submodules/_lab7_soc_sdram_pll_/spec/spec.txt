**Module name**: lab7_soc_sdram_pll

**Module specification**: This top-level module, lab7_soc_sdram_pll, is designed to control the synthesis and management of clock signals for Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM). It has control over various aspects of the SDRAM operation, such as Read/Write operations, frequency division, phase management, and synchronization. This module has multiple input and output ports. The input ports comprise various control, reset and addressing signals (address, areset, clk, configupdate, phasecounterselect, phasedone, phasestep, phaseupdown, read, reset, scanclk, scanclkena, scandata, write, writedata), which are vital for the SDRAM clock generation and management tasks. The output ports handle finalized clock signals (c0, c1), status indications (locked, phasedone, readdata, scandataout, scandone) providing information about the SDRAM operation. In terms of internal signals, it includes various wires and registers (wire_stdsync2_dout, wire_sd1_clk, wire_sd1_locked, pfdena_reg, prev_reset, etc.) that mediate communication and perform auxiliary operations within the module. Lastly, this module makes use of two submodules named 'lab7_soc_sdram_pll_stdsync_sv6' and 'lab7_soc_sdram_pll_altpll_lqa2', with the former handling the synchronization of the lock signal from the PLL and the latter being responsible for implementing the Phase-Locked Loop control logic that generates the required clock signals. This module's code is split into several blocks, each orchestrating different aspects of the system such as the synchronization of read and write signals, handing over the reset or control signals to the appropriate registers, or updating the system with the lock status. Altogether, these segregated units of code work in collaboration to present the clock generation and management system for SDRAM.
