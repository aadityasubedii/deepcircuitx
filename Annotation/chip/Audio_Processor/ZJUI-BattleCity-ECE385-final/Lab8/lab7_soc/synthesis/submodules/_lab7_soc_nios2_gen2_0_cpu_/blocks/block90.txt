This line of code performs the next state assignment for a right rotation control bit in a digital system that controls rotation. The function utilizes 'assign' in Verilog Hardware Description Language to continuously drive the value of 'D_ctrl_rot_right' to 'R_ctrl_rot_right_nxt'. If the value of 'D_ctrl_rot_right' changes at any time in the operation, the 'R_ctrl_rot_right_nxt' will immediately reflect this change due to the continuous assignment. The 'R_ctrl_rot_right_nxt' holds the next state to be implemented in the rotation operation.
