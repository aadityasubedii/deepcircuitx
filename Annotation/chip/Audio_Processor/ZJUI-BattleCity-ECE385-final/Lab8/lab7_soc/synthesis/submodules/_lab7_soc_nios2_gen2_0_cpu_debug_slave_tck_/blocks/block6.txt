This block implements an Altera standard synchronizer circuit. The synchronizer is driven by a clock signal provided to the 'clk' port, coming from signal 'tck'. The 'din' port receives a signal 'debugack' which is to be synchronized. The synchronized 'debugack' signal is produced at 'dout' port as 'debugack_sync'. It resets on the active-low 'reset_n' input, triggered by 'unxcomplemented_resetxx1'.
