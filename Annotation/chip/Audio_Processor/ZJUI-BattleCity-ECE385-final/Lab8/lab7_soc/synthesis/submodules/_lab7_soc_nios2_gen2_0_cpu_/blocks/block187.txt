Comment: 
This block of code serves as an ECC (Error Correction Code) valid bit reset and update mechanism. At each rising edge of the clock cycle or falling edge of reset, the block checks for reset status. If reset is active (low), the valid bit of the recoverable ECC for the write register file (`W_rf_ecc_recoverable_valid`) is reset to 0. If not in reset, `W_rf_ecc_recoverable_valid` is assigned the current status of the recoverable ECC validation flag for the error register file (`E_rf_ecc_recoverable_valid`).
