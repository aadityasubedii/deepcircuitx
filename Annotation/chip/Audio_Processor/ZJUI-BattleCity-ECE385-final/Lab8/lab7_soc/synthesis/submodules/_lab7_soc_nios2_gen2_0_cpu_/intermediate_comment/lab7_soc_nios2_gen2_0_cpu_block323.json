    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a 3-to-8 decoder, translating a 3-bit binary input 'ctrl_bits_for_mux' into one of eight 4-bit configurations on 'td_mode'. Implementation is achieved by a sequential 'case' structure where each potential 3-bit input pattern directly correlates with a unique 4-bit output assigned to 'td_mode'. This decoder caters to all 2^3 (or 8) permutations of the 3 input bits."
