    "block_comment": "This block of code is a write operation on a two-entry memory component. It operates only on a positive edge clock trigger and if the write enable signal is on, and the memory is not full. Depending on the 'wr_address' value, either 'entry_0' or 'entry_1' is written with the 'wr_data'. If any other address is provided, it defaults and does nothing."
