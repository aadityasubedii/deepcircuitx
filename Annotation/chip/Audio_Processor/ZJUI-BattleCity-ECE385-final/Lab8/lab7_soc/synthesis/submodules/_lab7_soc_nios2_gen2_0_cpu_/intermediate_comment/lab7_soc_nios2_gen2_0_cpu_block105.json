    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `D_op_rdctl` to `D_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg`. It directly copies the input value from `D_op_rdctl` and assigns it to `D_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg` without any condition, indicating that `D_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg` adopts the control read command from `D_op_rdctl`. This assignment is carried out every time `D_op_rdctl` changes, making `D_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg` behave as a wire receiving values from `D_op_rdctl`."
