This block manages the status and handling of interrupt events in a hardware design. The W_bstatus_reg_nxt register is updated depending on the E_valid signal, reflecting either the next state captured in W_bstatus_reg_inst_nxt or retaining its current state, enabling event-driven status updates. The W_ienable_reg_nxt register employs a control signal (E_wrctl_ienable) in conjunction with E_valid and 32-bit E_src1 data to set or maintain its state, following a mask and an interrupt enable logic. The W_ipending_reg_nxt captures the conditions under which an interrupt is active, by logically AND'ing the states of the interrupt activity indicator (iactive), current interrupt enable registers (W_ienable_reg, oci_ienable), and a 1-bit mask, thereby streamlining interrupt processing.
