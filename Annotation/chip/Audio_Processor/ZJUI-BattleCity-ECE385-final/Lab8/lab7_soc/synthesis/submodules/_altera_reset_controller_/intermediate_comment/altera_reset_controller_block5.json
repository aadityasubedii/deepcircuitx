    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a reset synchronizer, essential for maintaining system stability in scenarios potentially involving multiple clock domains. On the presence of a positive edge of 'clk', it updates the 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain' with new values assembled from the previous elements of the synchronizer chain and 'reset_out_pre'. This process ensures the smooth transition of a reset signal from one asynchronous domain to another, minimizing the risks of metastability."
