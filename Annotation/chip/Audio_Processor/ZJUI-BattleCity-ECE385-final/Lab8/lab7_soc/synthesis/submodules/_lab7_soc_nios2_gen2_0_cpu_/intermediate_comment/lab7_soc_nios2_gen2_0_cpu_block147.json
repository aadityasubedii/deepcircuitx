    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code forms a synchronous reset circuit. Triggering on the positive edge of a clock signal or the negative edge of a reset signal, the block sets the value of W_cmp_result. In a reset condition, where reset_n equals zero, W_cmp_result is forcibly set to a default value of zero. Conversely, in the absence of a reset, the value of W_cmp_result is updated to match the value of E_cmp_result at every clock cycle."
