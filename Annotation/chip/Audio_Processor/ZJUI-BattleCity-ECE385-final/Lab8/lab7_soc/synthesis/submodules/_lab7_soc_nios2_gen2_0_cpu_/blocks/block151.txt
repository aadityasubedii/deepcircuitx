Comment: 
This single line of code is responsible for assigning the value of the `W_valid` signal to the `W_valid_from_M` signal. This essentially means that the state or value of `W_valid` gets forwarded to `W_valid_from_M` whenever this line is executed. This line of code is generally used in cases where the state of `W_valid` is required to be tracked or controlled by another part of the program, which uses it as `W_valid_from_M`.
