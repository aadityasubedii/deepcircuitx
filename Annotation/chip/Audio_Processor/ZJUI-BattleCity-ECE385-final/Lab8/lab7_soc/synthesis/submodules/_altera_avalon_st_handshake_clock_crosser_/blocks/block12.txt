This Verilog block establishes a clock crosser for Avalon Streaming (ST) interface signals. The block uses the `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` component from Altera library to transfer data between two clock domains, where each is required to buffer data symbols for a specified depth and width. Key parameters include `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT` and `BITS_PER_SYMBOL` to set the symbol processing width and `FORWARD_SYNC_DEPTH` and `BACKWARD_SYNC_DEPTH` to define buffer depths. Control of the data flow is managed with `in_ready`, `in_valid`, `out_ready`, and `out_valid` signals. The `USE_OUTPUT_PIPELINE` option enables pipeline model in the output clock domain.
