Comment: 
This block of code handles reset and write operations driven by clock edges. During the negative clock edge, if reset signal 'reset_n' is low, it initiates a reset. On a positive clock edge, if both 'W_valid' and 'R_wr_dst_reg' are high indicating a valid write operation, it performs error handling to detect invalid write data, 'W_wr_data'. If invalid, it outputs an error message and stops simulation.
