    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for controlling the enable signal of the 9th FIFO in the structure. It does this by checking if the write pointer (fifo_wrptr) is at position 9 and input_ge1 is true, or if there are two or three spaces free (indicated by ge2_free and ge3_free respectively), the post-increments of the write pointer (fifo_wrptr_plus1 and fifo_wrptr_plus2 respectively) are at position 9, and the corresponding condition (input_ge2 or input_ge3) is true."
