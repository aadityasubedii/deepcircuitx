Comment: 
This block of Verilog code declares registers and wires for a memory management system, in particular for RAM access via JTAG and Avalon master port. Most notably, 'MonAReg' is a 11-bit register, while 'MonDReg' uniformly holds 32-bit data. It also handles read and write requests with 'jtag_ram_rd', 'jtag_ram_wr', and 'avalon_ociram_readdata_ready'. These elements interact with the Avalon Memory-Mapped (Avalon-MM) interface, which connects to the memory (RAM) via the 'ociram' wires. There's also a wire 'waitrequest' for handling potential delays or wait states during operations.
