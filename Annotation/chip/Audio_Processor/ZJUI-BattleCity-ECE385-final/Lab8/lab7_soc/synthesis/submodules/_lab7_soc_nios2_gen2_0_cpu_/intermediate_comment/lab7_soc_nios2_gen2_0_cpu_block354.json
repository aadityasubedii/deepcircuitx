    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is primarily for the declaration and initialization of internal cpu signals, address and breakpoints. This part of code declares a set of wires and registers, associated with CPU address enablement (D_cpu_addr_en, E_cpu_addr_en), CPU break functionality (E_xbrk_goto0, E_xbrk_goto1, E_xbrk_traceoff, E_xbrk_traceon, E_xbrk_trigout) and the initial address for the cpu input(cpu_i_address), setting up an armed breakpoint (xbrk0_armed). These variables act as internal signals used in the processor core for allowing address access, controlling execution flow based on breakpoints, and tracking/tracing state."
