    "block_comment": "The block is used for clock management and process control in the system. The first always block is executed at the positive edge of the clock cycle or the negative edge of the reset_n signal. If reset_n is 0, the R_ctrl_b_is_dst is set to 0, this indicates that the system is in the reset state. If the R_en signal is high, the new value for R_ctrl_b_is_dst is the next state value, indicating the system is processing or passing through the current state. The following section assigns the value from operation checks to D_ctrl_ignore_dst and R_ctrl_ignore_dst_nxt, which helps determining whether the destination address should be ignored during operation execution."
