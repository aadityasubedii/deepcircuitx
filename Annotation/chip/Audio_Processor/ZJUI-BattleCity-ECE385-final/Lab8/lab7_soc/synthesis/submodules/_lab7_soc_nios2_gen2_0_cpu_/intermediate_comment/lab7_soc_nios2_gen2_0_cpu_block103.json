    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a register control logic for reading operation under clock edge behavior. Using system verilog hardware description language, at every positive edge of the clock signal or at the negative edge of the reset signal, the register `R_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg` is updated. If the reset signal is active (low in this case), `R_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg` is cleared to 0. However, during normal operation (reset_n not active), the register is updated with the value of `R_ctrl_rd_ctl_reg_nxt` when `R_en` signal is high, which implies that register read operation is enabled."
