    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous data flip-flop with asynchronous reset for the `E_shift_rot_result` signal. On each positive edge (rising edge) of the clock or any negative edge (falling edge) of `reset_n`, the flip-flop updates its contents. If `reset_n` is 0 (active low), the flip-flop will be reset and clears `E_shift_rot_result` to 0 immediately. Otherwise, on a clock's positive edge, `E_shift_rot_result` is set to the value of `E_shift_rot_result_nxt`."
