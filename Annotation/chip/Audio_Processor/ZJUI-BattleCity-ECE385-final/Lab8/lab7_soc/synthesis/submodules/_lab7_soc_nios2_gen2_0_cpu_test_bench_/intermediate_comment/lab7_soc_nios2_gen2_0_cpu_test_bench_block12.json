    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic block that responds to the positive edge of a clock signal or the negative edge of a reset signal. If the reset signal is not active (low), it checks if a write operation is valid. More specifically, it checks if the bit-wise OR operation on all bits of the `R_wr_dst_reg` results in undefined value. If this ever happens, the program writes an error message to the output indicating the time and details of the error and then stops the simulation."
