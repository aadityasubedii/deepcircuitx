    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for managing the pointers in a memory system using memory blocks. It covers pointer incrementing and updating depending on certain conditions. If the \"USE_MEMORY_BLOCKS\" variable is set to 1, it generates an incremented version of both \"write\" (wr_ptr) and \"read\" (rd_ptr) pointers by adding 1, which means moving to the next position in the memory block. Next, the \"write\" and \"read\" pointers are updated conditionally. If there is an error (as indicated by \"drop_on_error\" flag) the \"write\" pointer stays at the start-of-packet (sop) pointer; if a write operation is intended, the incremented \"write\" pointer is used; otherwise, it retains the previous \"write\" pointer. In a similar vein, if a read operation is intended, the block uses the incremented \"read\" pointer; otherwise, it holds on to its initial position."
