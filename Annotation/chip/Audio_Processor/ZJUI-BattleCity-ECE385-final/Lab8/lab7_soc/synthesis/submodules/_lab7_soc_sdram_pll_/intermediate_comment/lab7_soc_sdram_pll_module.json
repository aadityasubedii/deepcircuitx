    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'lab7_soc_sdram_pll' module consists of control logic for SDRAM operation, managing clock signal synthesis and other important aspects. It uses control, reset, phase management, and addressing signals as inputs, often processed through internal registers and wires, and outputs clock signals, status indicators for SDRAM operation. The entire system consists of well-coordinated submodules 'lab7_soc_sdram_pll_stdsync_sv6' and 'lab7_soc_sdram_pll_altpll_lqa2' for handling synchronization and Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) respectively. The code is designed into separate blocks, each managing specific aspects such as synchronization, status update, and control signal handling."
