This block of code is a sequential logic for a First-In-First-Output (FIFO) buffer, fifo_1. It is activated on the positive edge of the system clock, or the negative edge of the reset signal. If the reset signal is active (low), the FIFO is reset to zero. When reset is not active (high) and the FIFO enable signal is active, the value of fifo_1_mux is loaded into fifo_1, indicating the addition of a new data word to the FIFO buffer.
