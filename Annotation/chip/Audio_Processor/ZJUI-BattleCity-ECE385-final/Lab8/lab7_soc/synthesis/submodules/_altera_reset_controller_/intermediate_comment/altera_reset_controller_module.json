    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe altera_reset_controller module processes and synchronizes multiple reset and reset request signals into a single, de-bounced, and edge-detectable output signal suitable for FPGA design. The implemented functionality primarily depends on internal signals for holding intermediate states and synchronization of input reset signals. Detailed configurations, such as synchronization depth and assertion time, can be set through parameters. The design enhances system stability by addressing signal metastability issues."
