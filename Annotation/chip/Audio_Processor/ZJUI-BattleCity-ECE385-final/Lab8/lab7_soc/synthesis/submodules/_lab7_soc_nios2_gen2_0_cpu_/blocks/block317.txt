This block serves as a 3-bit binary multiplexer where the output, compute_input_tm_cnt, changes with respect to the input, switch_for_mux. It uses an 'always' block which is triggered any time the input 'switch_for_mux' changes. The 'case' command within the block decides which output signal should be set, basing this decision on the current value of 'switch_for_mux'. For each possible 3-bit binary input (from '000' to '111'), a particular output is given via assignment to 'compute_input_tm_cnt'.
