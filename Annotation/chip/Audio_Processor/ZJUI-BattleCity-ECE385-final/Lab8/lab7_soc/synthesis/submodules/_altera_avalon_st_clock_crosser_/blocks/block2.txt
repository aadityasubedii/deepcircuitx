Comment: 
This block enables optional output pipelining in a Verilog design. When the USE_OUTPUT_PIPELINE parameter is set to 1, an instance of the Altera Avalon Streaming Pipeline Base is generated. The pipeline uses the specified BITS_PER_SYMBOL and SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT parameters, and is triggered by the out_clk and out_reset signals. Data is transferred between in_ready and in_valid signals, synchronizing input and output through internal buffering. Otherwise, if USE_OUTPUT_PIPELINE is not set, the output validity and readiness signals are directly assigned from their internal counterparts, and the output data takes the buffered input data.
