    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is essentially responsible for assigning a logic operation for the Data path(D). It does this based on the controller signals, particularly D_ctrl_alu_force_xor and D_ctrl_alu_force_and. If D_ctrl_alu_force_xor is true, '11' is assigned to D_logic_op. If it's false and D_ctrl_alu_force_and is true, '01' is assigned. If both are false, the raw D_logic_op is used. The logic operation thus assigned could be helpful in further computations."
