Comment: 
This block of code describes a synchronous, active-low resettable register. The register is updated on the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'. If the reset signal 'reset_n' is asserted (low), then the register 'din_s1' is reset (set to 0). If reset signal 'reset_n' is not asserted (high), then 'din_s1' takes the value of 'din' on the next rising edge of 'clk'.
