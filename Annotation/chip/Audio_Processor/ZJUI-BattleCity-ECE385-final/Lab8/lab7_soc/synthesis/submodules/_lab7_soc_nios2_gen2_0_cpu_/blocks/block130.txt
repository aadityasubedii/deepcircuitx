This block of code is a sequential circuit for updating the value of a control status register named "R_ctrl_custom". This block is triggered at every positive edge of the clock ("clk") or at a negative edge of the reset signal ("reset_n"). If a negative edge reset is received (reset signal is 0), this block resets the control status register "R_ctrl_custom" to 0. However, if there's no reset and the enable flag "R_en" is active (1), it takes the next custom control value "R_ctrl_custom_nxt" as the current custom control value for "R_ctrl_custom".
