This block of code implements a register named `fifo_14`, that is updated on each positive edge of the clock, unless a reset is triggered. The reset is active low, meaning if `reset_n` is 0, `fifo_14` is cleared (synchronous reset). If the reset is not asserted, on each positive clock edge, if the `fifo_14_enable` signal is high, the `fifo_14` register takes the value from `fifo_14_mux`. This is a simple way to control when the data in `fifo_14` gets updated; it happens only when the enable signal is asserted.
