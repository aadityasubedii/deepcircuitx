This block of code is responsible for handling reset of two registers: 'trc_im_addr' and 'trc_wrap' on both positive edge of the clock 'clk' and negative edge of the 'jrst_n' signal. Depending on the value of 'jrst_n', it controls the values of 'trc_im_addr' and 'trc_wrap'. If 'jrst_n' is zero, both 'trc_im_addr' and 'trc_wrap' are reset to zero. Otherwise, still they are reset to zero.
