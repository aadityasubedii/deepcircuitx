    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for value assignment to control the state of the system. It takes the current state of the variable 'D_ctrl_st_ex' and assigns it to 'R_ctrl_st_ex_nxt' which defines the next state control of the system. This non-blocking assignment occurs under all circumstances, ensuring the sequential relationship between 'R_ctrl_st_ex_nxt' and 'D_ctrl_st_ex' is maintained across different states in the system."
