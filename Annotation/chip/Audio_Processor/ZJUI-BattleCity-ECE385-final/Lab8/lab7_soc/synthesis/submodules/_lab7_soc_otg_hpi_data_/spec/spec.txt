Module name: lab7_soc_otg_hpi_data.

Module specification: The lab7_soc_otg_hpi_data module serves as a data interface for an On-The-Go (OTG) High-Performance Interface (HPI) in a System-on-Chip (SoC). The module accepts various input ports such as address, chipselect, clk, in_port, reset_n, write_n, and writedata. These govern the module functionality such as address to be read/written, read or write operation enable, system clock, input data, chip selection for write operation, and reset signals. The module outputs through out_port and readdata ports which represent the data output and the data read from the specified address, respectively.

Several key internal signals are used in this module. 'clk_en' wire is tied high to constantly update the readdata output on each rising clock edge. 'data_in' wire is directly connected to the in_port input. 'data_out' is a 16-bit register that holds the write data to the specified address whenever the requirements for chip_select, write_n, and address are met. 'out_port' is directly connected to the data_out register, and 'read_mux_out' is an operation output line that masks 'data_in' to predict a control/data path for the 'readdata' register depending on 'address' condition.

The module is divided into distinct blocks. The first block declares inputs, outputs, and internal signals. The second block defines the constant clk_en wire and the output from the read_mux_out operation. The third and fourth blocks are sensitive to clock input and reset_n input respectively, conditioning the updates to the read_data and data_out registers. The last block of the module assigns the data_in wire to the in_port input and out_port wire to data_out register. Through this design, the lab7_soc_otg_hpi_data module is able to support basic read and write operations for an OTG HPI device in an SoC environment.
