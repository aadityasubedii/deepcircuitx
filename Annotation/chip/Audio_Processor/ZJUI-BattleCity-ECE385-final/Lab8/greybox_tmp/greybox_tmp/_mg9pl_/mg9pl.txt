Module-level comment: The 'mg9pl' module in Verilog serves as a 8-bit RAM block, utilizing an lpm_ram_dq instance named 'mgl_prim1'. Input and output operations are driven by clock signals 'inclock' and 'outclock'. Module permits writing 8-bit data into a specified address when write enable signal 'we' is active. Output 'q' sends out the data at a specified address, orchestrated by 'outclock'. An internal wire 'wire_mgl_prim1_q' is used for real-time data transfer from memory instance to module output. Data and address width is 8-bit and do not use embedded array blocks for storage.
