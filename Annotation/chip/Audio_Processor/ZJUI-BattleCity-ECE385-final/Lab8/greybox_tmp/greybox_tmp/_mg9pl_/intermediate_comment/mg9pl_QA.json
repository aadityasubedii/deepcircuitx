It is instantiated using an lpm_ram_dq instance named mgl_prim1. This memory module takes in an 8-bit address and an 8-bit data input. The control signals are 'inclock' and 'outclock' for synchronizing input and output operations, 'we' as write enable. The data output is an 8-bit 'q'. The data, address, and output data are registered types as indicated by lpm_address_control, lpm_indata, and lpm_outdata parameters, which means their values are stored until a new value is loaded. The lpm_width and lpm_widthad parameters confirm the 8-bit width of the data and address. The use_eab parameter is set to \"OFF\", means it doesn't use embedded array blocks for storing data. Its operation would be driven by the state of the control signals at the rising edge of the clock inputs."
