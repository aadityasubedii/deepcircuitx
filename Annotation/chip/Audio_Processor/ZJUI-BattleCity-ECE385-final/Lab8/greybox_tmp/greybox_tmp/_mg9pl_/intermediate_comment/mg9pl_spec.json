    "spec": "Module name: mg9pl. \n\nModule specification: The mg9pl module in Verilog serves as a representation of a RAM block, which is primarily instantiated through an lpm_ram_dq instance named mgl_prim1. The core operation of this module is controlled by the state of various signals at the rising edge of its clock inputs. This module works with an 8-bit address (`address`) and an 8-bit data input (`data`). The timing of input and output operations are synchronised through clock signals, `inclock` and `outclock` respectively. The write enable signal `we`, when activated, triggers writing the data held by the `data` signal into the memory location pointed by the `address` signal.\n\nThe memory read operation outputs an 8-bit value referenced by `q`, and this read operation takes place only when the `we` signal is not active to ensure no simultaneous read/write operations. Inside the module, a wire `wire_mgl_prim1_q` connects the `q` output of the memory instance `mgl_prim1` to the `q` output of the module, enabling real-time data transfer from the memory block to external parts of the design. \n\nThe data, address, and output data are all registered types, thus their values are stored until new ones are loaded. As specified by the parameters `lpm_address_control`, `lpm_indata`, and `lpm_outdata`, the memory block operates with a width of 8 bits (both address and data) as defined by `lpm_width` and `lpm_widthad`. It doesn't use embedded array blocks for storing data as specified by `use_eab`, implying that the data is stored in registers or latch-based structures.",
