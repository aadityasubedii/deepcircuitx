    "module": "Module-level comment: The SPI_to_I2S_bridge module converts 16-bit SPI formatted speaker data into I2S format. It utilizes the clock (clk), reset (rst), and speaker data (spkr_data) as inputs. The converted data is output through data_out, governed by m_clk, LR_clk, and s_clk with DONE indicating process completion. Internally, an address register (adr) and memory data wire (memdata) facilitate its functionality, alongside the i2s_output sub-module for processing."
