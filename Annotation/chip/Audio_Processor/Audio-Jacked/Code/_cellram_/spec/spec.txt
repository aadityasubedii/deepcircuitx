Module name: cellram. Module specification: The cellram module simulates a Cellular RAM (PSRAM) device, implementing synchronous and asynchronous access modes with configurable burst operations and timing parameters. It has input ports for clock (clk), control signals (adv_n, cre, ce_n, oe_n, we_n), byte enables (lb_n, ub_n), address (addr), and data (dq), with output ports for wait signal (o_wait) and bidirectional data (dq). Internal signals manage memory operations, configuration registers, state machines, and timing checks. The module consists of several blocks: memory array management, configuration register handling, asynchronous and synchronous access control, burst operations, refresh management, and extensive timing checks. It includes features such as deep power-down mode, partial array refresh, and software-controlled register access. The module uses include files for parameters
