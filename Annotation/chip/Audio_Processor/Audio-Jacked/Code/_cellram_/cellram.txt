Module-level comment: This module simulates a Cellular RAM (PSRAM) device with synchronous and asynchronous access modes. It implements memory read/write operations, burst modes, and configuration registers. The module uses state machines for access control, handles timing parameters, and performs extensive timing checks. It supports features like deep power-down mode, partial array refresh, and software-controlled register access. The implementation includes memory array management, configuration register handling, and both asynchronous and synchronous access control logic.
