    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a delay flip-flop in a Verilog RTL code. Its primary function is to register a '1' to the addr2wir output one time unit after the addr signal changes. The block achieves this functionality by using non-blocking assignments. At the time the addr signal changes, the block first assigns '0' to addr2wir, and then after a 1 unit delay it assigns '1' to addr2wir, thus creating a delay flip-flop mechanism."
