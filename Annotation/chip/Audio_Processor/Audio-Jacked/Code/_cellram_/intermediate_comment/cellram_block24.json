    "block_comment": "This block of code is a clock-edge-based constraint verification for a given digital system. Running on the falling edge of an input clock, it verifies the timing constraints for the system to prevent setup and hold time violations. If the current time (using `$realtime`) is greater than the predefined clock period (`tCLK`), it checks if the difference between current time and positive edge of clock time (`tm_clk_pos`) is less than a specified time constant (`tKP`). If such a violation is detected, it outputs an error message indicating the time of violation and the excess time beyond allowed limit. After this check, the time for negative edge of clock (`tm_clk_neg`) is updated by subtracting a small delay from current time to prepare for next cycle's clock period check."
