    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a corrupted memory system in Verilog. When the 'par_enabled' signal is high, the system reorganizes the available memory addresses within a specified range ('partial_address_offset' to 'partial_address_offset + partial_address_size'). The for-loop iterates over the memory used, copying over only the data within the given range. Subsequent lines clear the rest of the memory. The net effect is that the occupied memory space is reduced, and the unused memory data is set to an unknown state, emulating a memory corruption scenario. The 'memory_used' at the end holds the number of addresses that contain valid data after corruption."
