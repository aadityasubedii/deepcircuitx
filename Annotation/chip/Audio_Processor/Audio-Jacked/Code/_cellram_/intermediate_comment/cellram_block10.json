    "block_comment": "This block checks for write mask violations (tOW). It's triggered on the rising edge of the `tow_check` signal, which indicates that a write operation is being performed. If the output enable signal, `oe_n`, is active low, then the block checks for write mask violations. If any write mask violation is detected, namely `dq_in` is not in high impedance state, it displays an error message indicating a write mask violation. Upon finishing the error check, it resets `tow_check` to `0` to prepare for the next operation."
