    "block_comment": "The function checks if a memory address already exists. It accepts one input, 'addr', which represents the memory address to be checked, and it returns a binary output (0 or 1) based on the address's existence in the memory. The function starts by setting the output to 0, then it runs a for loop over the memory addresses. If the input address is found in the memory, the output is set to 1, and the loop is immediately broken, thus enhancing the efficiency of the function."
