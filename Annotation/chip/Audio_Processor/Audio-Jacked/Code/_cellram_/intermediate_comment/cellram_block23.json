    "block_comment": "This Verilog block acts as a debugger, monitoring potential timing violations based on certain conditions related to clock and chip-enable signal (ce_n). During every activation of 'ce_n', the block checks if there's any specific condition (tHD, tCBPH, tCPH, tWR, tPU) violation in the existing real-time system. If a violation is detected, it displays respective error or warning messages with accurate timestamps for tracking. The conditions checked are based on timing parameters like clock high duration (tHD), chip enable pulse high width (tCBPH and tCPH), write recovery time (tWR), and power up time (tPU). The block also records the real-time during each 'ce_n' activation and other appropriate moments in system variables tm_ce_n, tm_tcw, and tm_tdpd for further use and reference."
