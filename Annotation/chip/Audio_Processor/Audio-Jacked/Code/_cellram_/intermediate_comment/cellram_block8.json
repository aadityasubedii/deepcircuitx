    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for a simple \"AND\" operation. It takes as input signals `A` and `B` and assigns the output `Z` with the logical 'AND' operation result of the inputs. The code block's functionality is achieved through the use of the 'assign' operator of Verilog, where expression on the right side of the operator is assigned to the element on the left. The 'AND' logic gate behaviour is implemented here with the bitwise AND operator (&) of Verilog. The output `Z` will be high only when both inputs `A` and `B` are high, otherwise it will be low.\n"
