    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a trigger condition that checks for updates in the third bit (bit 2) of the address variable, 'addr'. It then calls 'addr_timing_check' with the bit index 2. If bit 2 of the 'addr' variable changes, this block is activated and subsequently runs the addr_timing_check procedure, with 2 as the input parameter to the function, ensuring correct timing behavior of this bit level in the address bus."
