    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a delay flip-flop configuration for a digital signal. Primarily, it responds to changes in the significant bits of an address signal. When the designated address bits undergo a modification, the addr2dqr signal is initially set to '0' (false). However, after a single time unit delay (#(1)), the addr2dqr signal is reassigned to '1' (true). This sequence enables the monitoring of important bit changes by creating a momentary false condition followed by a signal flip to true."
