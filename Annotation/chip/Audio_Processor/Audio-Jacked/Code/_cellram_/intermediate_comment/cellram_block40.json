    "block_comment": "This block seems to handle conditions around clock enable signal (ce_n), debugging, data corruption, memory write operations, power management, and register updates based on specific violations or conditions. When clock enable (ce_n) is low, it displays a divider for debug mode and handles 'wait_out' signal assignments. If the ce_n is not low, it checks for conditions of data corruption, resets multiple variables such as 'last_ce', 'sync_latency_cntr', 'random_delay', 'row_count', 'rbc'. For managing deep power down conditions, it clears 'memory_used' in debug mode and checks for violation of tDPDX timing. For power up, it resets 'deep_power_down_exit', and sets 'tm_power_up' to the current time. For generations greater than CR10 and in deep power down state, it writes to register RCR with specific data and control bit values."
