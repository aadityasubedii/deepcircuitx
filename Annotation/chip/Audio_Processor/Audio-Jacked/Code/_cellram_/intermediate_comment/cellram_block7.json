    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for handling the de-assertion of the `adv_n` signal. The implementation is such that, within a negative-edge sensitive always block, it checks if `adv_n` is low. If it is, it first sets `adv2dqr` to 0 instantaneously, and then schedules a non-blocking assignment to set `adv2dqr` back to 1 after 1 time unit. Thus, `adv2dqr` is subjected to a brief pulse whenever `adv_n` is de-asserted."
