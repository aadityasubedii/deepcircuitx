    "block_comment": "This block is a timing validator for the 'by' signal in a Verilog design. It gets activated on any change of 'by_n' signal. If the 'ce_n' signal is not asserted, it checks for 'adv_n_in' signal. If the advance signal is indeed asserted, it then calculates if the Hold Time (tHD) condition keeps intact or not by subtracting the last positive edge timing of the clock (tm_clk_pos) from the current time. If the Hold Time condition is violated, it displays an error message. Finally, the 'tm_by_n' is updated to the current time and 'tm_tbw' is flagged for the next begin-end block."
