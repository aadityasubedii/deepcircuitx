    "block_comment": "This hardware block's function is to manage the synchronization process by setting the sync_access signal to 0. The block gets triggered on the falling edge of adv_n (which typically represents an advance clock signal), or the rising edge of ce_n (usually a clock enable signal). When either of these events occurs, it sets sync_access, which is likely a signal flag for synchronization access, to binary 0, effectively indicating that access is not granted or is ready to be granted anew."
