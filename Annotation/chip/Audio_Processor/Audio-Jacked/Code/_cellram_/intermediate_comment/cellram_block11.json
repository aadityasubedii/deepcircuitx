    "block_comment": "This block carries out data integrity checks during system operation. Specifically, it verifies that the 'tDH' specification, which stands for data hold time, is not violated. The evaluation is governed by an 'always' block that triggers on any change in 'dq_in'. If the system isn't in synchronous mode ('sync_access' is low), it checks whether the current time minus the time of the last write operation 'tm_write_end' is less than the required data hold time 'tDH'. If this condition holds, an error display indicating a 'tDH' violation and the time difference is generated. Beside this, it logs the time of the latest observed transition on 'dq_in' to the variable 'tm_dq_tdw'."
