    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the update mechanism for an asynchronous address signal. Specifically, if the 'adv_n_in' signal is not active (low), then it assigns the input 'addr' to the internal register 'async_addr' and also records the current simulation time to 'tm_async_addr'. The implementation involves an always block in Verilog, triggered at the event of changes in 'adv_n_in' or 'addr', ensuring that the address and associated timestamp update only under the appropriate condition. The utilization of the '$realtime' function indicates the involvement of real-time simulation."
