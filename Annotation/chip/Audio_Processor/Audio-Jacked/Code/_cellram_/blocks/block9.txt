Comment: 
The given Verilog block is designed to carry out error detection during power down transitions. It gets activated at the positive edge of the 'ce2cem' signal. If the 'deep_power_down_exit' signal has not been set to logic high (1'b1), then it implies a timing violation related to clock enable multiplexor (CEM). As a result, an error message along with the current real time is displayed to indicate a 'tCEM' violation.
