This block maps various control signals in a digital system. The assignment statements simply tie the left-hand side signal to the right-hand side signal. Some signals like `clk2waite`, `adv2dqe`, `adv2dq`, and `adv2wi` are directly assigned their corresponding values. Other signals including `zz2pd`, `ce2dqe`, `ce2dq`, `ce2cem`, `ce2wi`, `ce2waite`, `ce2wait`, and `ce2rst` are inverted versions of their corresponding values, as indicated by the `!` (NOT) operator, denoting active-low control signals. The assign statements are continuously active, meaning the changes on the right-hand side are immediately reflected on the left-hand side.
