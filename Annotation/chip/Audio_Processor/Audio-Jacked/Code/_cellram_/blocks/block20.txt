Comment: 
This block of code enforces the timing constraints for the write enable (ADV#) and address (ADDR) inputs in asynchronous mode. It leverages in-built system functions to detect violations of 'tAS' specification. Crucially, if the system is not in 'sync_access' mode and both 'we_n' and 'ce2wi' signals are asserted, the block checks that the time elapsed since the falling edge of 'ADV#' and 'ADDR' is at least 'tAS'. If it's less than 'tAS', relevant error messages are displayed indicating a 'tAS' violation.
