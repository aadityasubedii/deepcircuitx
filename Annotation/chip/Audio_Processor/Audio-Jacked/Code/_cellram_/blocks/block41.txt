This block defines the initial values for various signals and variables used in the design. The operation starts off by setting the time format for simulation displays, following which several variables and signals such as `sync_access`, `software_access_rcr_write`, `async_wr_lockout`, `ref_collision`, and `tm_power_up` are set to their default values. This is achieved through direct assignment of predefined constants or literals. Additionally, a few variable entries in the arrays designated as `BCR` and `RCR` are written with some default values through the function `register_write`. For memory management, `memory_used` is set to 0.
