The given block is a task which checks if there have been any timing violations in the address signal. The task takes an integer 'i' as an input to check specific address bits. When certain conditions ('ce_n', 'adv_n_in', 'oe_n', 'we_n', 'by_n') are met, the task enters a switch case driven by the input 'i'. Each case queries the difference between the current time and the previous time an address bit was checked, and flags an error if that difference is less than the predefined time period (tPC). Each case also updates the timestamp of the last check conducted on that address bit.
