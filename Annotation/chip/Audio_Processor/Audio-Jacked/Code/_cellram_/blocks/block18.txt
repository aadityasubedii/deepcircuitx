This block of code inspects the Verilog simulation timing requirements. It primarily checks for two timing violation conditions. It employs conditional logic to perform two parallel timing checks. If the enable signal (ce_n) is low or tavh_check is high, it checks for Hold Time (tHD) violation by comparing current real time with clock positive edge time (tm_clk_pos). Simultaneously, in case of a synchronous access or during the initial latency period, it checks for Address Valid to Clock High (tAVH) violation through a similar method. Violations, if any, are reported with an error message displaying the violation duration.
