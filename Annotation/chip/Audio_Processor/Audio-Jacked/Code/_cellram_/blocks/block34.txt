Comment: 
This block of code is essentially controlling the synchronous access signal ('sync_access') in a digital system. A positive edge triggered flip-flop is implemented, which gets activated at the rising edge of the clock signal ('clk'). On each positive transition of the clock, 'sync_access' signal is updated as the logical NOT (!) of 'ce_n' (chip enable signal). It indicates that 'sync_access' is enabled when 'ce_n' is low and vice versa, synchronously with the clock cycles.
