This block is a timing sanity check mechanism within a larger memory system. It monitors address-related signals and generates error messages when necessary timing conditions are not met. Considering the inputs such as addr, tavh_check, ce_n and sync_access, the block primarily checks two conditions - the hold time condition (tHD) and the address valid to output hold time condition (tAVH), both of which are checked in relation to the realtime. If tHD or tAVH conditions are violated, it prints corresponding error messages with specific details of the violations. The block also updates tm_addr with current realtime at the end of every event with addr.
