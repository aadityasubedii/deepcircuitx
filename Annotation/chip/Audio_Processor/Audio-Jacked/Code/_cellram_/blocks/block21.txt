This code block monitors for timing violations occurring on the Write Enable signal. Using sensitivity to the Write Enable negative edge signal, any change invokes the loop. When Chip Enable is active, it checks for Address Valid signal timing, and synchronous access violations if enabled. It displays an error message if the time from the last positive clock transition is less than the hold time or if the Write Enable pulse width is less, indicating timing violations.
