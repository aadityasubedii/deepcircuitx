This block of code defines a memory write task in a Verilog system. The task accepts address range, data mask and actual data as inputs, checks if the address is within permissible range and writes the data to valid addresses. The block uses bitwise operations to compute the write data based on different conditions. When the memory is full, it displays an error message and terminates the task. During the operation, if the address does not already have allocated memory, it increments the memory used and stores the memory address and write data in dedicated registers. This block is efficient as it performs direct hardware-level operations, saving resource consumption.
