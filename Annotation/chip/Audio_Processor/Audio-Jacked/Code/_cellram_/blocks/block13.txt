This block of code is responsible for triggering the `addr_timing_check(1)` function whenever there is a change in the second bit (`addr[1]`) of the `addr` signal. It is implemented using an `always` block which is key to the procedural logic in Verilog, and wherein the sensitivity list contains `addr[1]` to detect the change and prompt the action accordingly.
