The block of code is used to control the `saddr2dqr` signal value in response to the advancement signal `adv_n`. When `adv_n` is not activated (when its value is false, or '0'), the `saddr2dqr` is first set to '0', and then, after a delay of 1 time unit (`#(1)`), it is set to '1'. This is achieved by an event-driven procedural block `always @(posedge clk)` which is activated on the positive edge of the `clk` signal.
