    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'enabled_register' module functions as a simple D flip-flop utilizing a configurable bit-width register. The register stores the value of input 'a' on every positive edge instance of the 'clk' signal. The 'reset' input is present but does not affect the module's functionality in this implementation. The output 'b' mimics the register and is updated with 'a's value on the rising edge of the clock. This module does not use any internal signals; instead, it directly assigns the value of 'a' to 'b' using an always block triggered at the positive edge of the 'clk'."
