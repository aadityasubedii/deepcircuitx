Module name: enabled_register

Module specification: 
The 'enabled_register' module is a fundamental representation of a configurable bit-width register updated on the positive edge of an input clock signal. While the register is able to be reset, the provided module code does not implement a reset action; thus, no change is effectuated when the 'reset' signal is active. The module primarily functions as a simple D flip-flop, where it stores and holds the value of an input signal 'a' on every positive-edge instance of the clock signal. 

The module design includes three input ports: 'clk', 'reset', and 'a'. The 'clk', clock signal, interfaces with the clock line and works to determine when the register ought be updated. The 'reset' signal serves as a potential trigger to reset the register to a predefined value, typically zero, however, no reset is implemented in this particular module. 'a' serves as the data input port that is a bit array of configurable size, relayed by the module parameter 'WIDTH'. This data gets stored into the register at every positive edge of the clock signal. 

The module has one output port: 'b'. The 'b' port models the register's current stored value. 'b' updates with the value of the input 'a' at each positive clock edge. 

This design does not use any internal signals within the module, with the functional logic directly assigning the value of the input 'a' to the output 'b'. 

The module is comprised of a parameterized always block, that triggers on the positive edge of the clock signal. This module, operating as a D flip-flop, directly assigns the value of input 'a' to output 'b' making this a very straightforward implementation with the goal of updating a register on the positive edge of a clock signal.
