It uses a finite state machine(FSM) with three states namely st_RESET, st_COUNT, and st_HOLD for controlling command execution, updating commands, and latching addresses and data. It uses input signals like sysclk, rst, command, go, mem_addr, mem_byte_en, and mem_data_out for controlling these operations. The MEM_DATA is a bidirectional bus for data read/write operations. The module also returns a mem_idle flag signaling when the process is idle or in comparison busy. It indicates a write operation with command 0 and a read operation with command 1. Timing constraints/counts for write and read operations are also integrated within the state machine to ensure proper read and write operations."

For instance, sysclk provides synchronization, and command and mem_addr dictate the type and location of memory operations. The 'go' signal triggers the start of a read or write operation, while mem_byte_en controls which memory byte is under operation. The reset signal can restore the memory operation setup to its initial state.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. mem_idle: Port that indicates if the memory module is currently not in operation.\n2. mem_data_in: Data input from module to memory.\n3. MEM_ADDR_OUT: Address output to memory.\n4. MEM_CEN, MEM_OEN, MEM_WEN, MEM_LBN, MEM_UBN: Control signals for memory.\n5. MEM_ADV: Address validity indication.\n6. MEM_DATA: Bidirectional data communication port.\n\nExplanation: \nThe output ports provide insight into the current operation and state of the PSRAM memory module. For example, mem_data_in and MEM_ADDR_OUT, respectively, relay data and the address that need to be written to memory. MEM_CEN, MEM_OEN, MEM_WEN, MEM_LBN, MEM_UBN provide control signals to complete the read/write operation. The mem_idle signal designates when the module is not engaged in an operation, and MEM_ADV indicates the validity of the current address. Lastly, MEM_DATA suggests the last performed operation's result\u2014either the data read from memory or the high impedance state when a write operation is performed.\n"
