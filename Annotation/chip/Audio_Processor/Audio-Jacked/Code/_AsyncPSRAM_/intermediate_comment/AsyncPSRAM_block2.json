    "block_comment": "The block assigns the current state of MEM_DATA and mem_data_out to b and a, respectively, on every rising edge of the system clock. It acts as a data synchronizer, etching input data from the memory onto internal signals a and b, thereby enabling the downstream hardware to operate off these stable, clock-aligned values."
