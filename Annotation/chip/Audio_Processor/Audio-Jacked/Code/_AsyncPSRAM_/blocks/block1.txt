Comment: 
This block is a state machine handling memory operations in a hardware system. Upon system clock's positive edge, the block either initiates a reset mode or executes a state flow determined by `state` variable. In reset mode, default values are assigned to all essential system variables and signals. A 'go' signal toggles the state to 'st_COUNT', triggering memory transaction with address outputs, control signals manipulation, and byte enable settings. 'st_COUNT' state waits for a specified count, on completion of which 'st_HOLD' state is triggered, marking memory operation completion. System stays in this hold state for a few counts before transitioning back to reset mode, preparing for next possible 'go'.
