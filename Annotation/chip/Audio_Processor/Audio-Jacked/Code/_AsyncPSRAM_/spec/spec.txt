Module name: AsyncPSRAM. 

Module specification: The AsyncPSRAM is a module designed to interact with Asynchronous Pseudo Static Random Access Memory (PSRAM). It is controlled by a finite state machine (FSM) featuring three states: st_RESET, st_COUNT, and st_HOLD for command execution, command update, and latching addresses and data, respectively. 

The input ports include 'sysclk' for system clock synchronization, 'rst' for reset purposes, 'mem_data_out' for data output from memory to module, 'mem_addr' for identifying memory address, 'mem_byte_en' for deciding the memory segment under operation, 'command' to determine if it's a read/write operation, and 'go' signal to initiate an operation.

Output ports include 'mem_idle' to signify if memory is occupied, 'mem_data_in' for data input from the module to memory, 'MEM_ADDR_OUT' for supplying the address to memory, 'MEM_CEN', 'MEM_OEN', 'MEM_WEN', 'MEM_LBN', 'MEM_UBN' as control signals, 'MEM_ADV' indicating address validity, and 'MEM_DATA', the bidirectional data port.

Internally, several signals assist operations. These include 'a' and 'b' which help with data transfers, 'outp' the wire to transfer read data from memory to 'mem_data_in', 'waitcount' and 'waitcount2' for counting cycles during operations, 'current_cmd' to reflect the ongoing command, and 'state' to represent the FSM state.

The code is divided into sections corresponding to tasks such as clock synchronization, reset and operation handling, and FSM control. The FSM operation outlines three states - st_RESET (idle/reset mode), st_COUNT (count/wait time for write and read operation), and st_HOLD (holding state after an operation), providing a structured and clear operation processing regimen. This comprehensive, detailed overview ensures the memory can be read and written to efficiently and rapidly, meeting PSRAM's inherent needs.
