Module-level comment: AsyncPSRAM is a module catering to operations with Asynchronous PSRAM. Utilizing a finite state machine with states st_RESET, st_COUNT, and st_HOLD, it enables command control, update, and effective latching. It uses input ports like 'sysclk' for synchronization, 'command' and 'mem_addr' for operation type and location, with 'go' triggering the start. Output ports indicate operation status, data to be written, and provide control signals. Internal signals like 'waitcount' ensure appropriate operation delays, while 'a' and 'b' manage data transfers. Each FSM state corresponds to different operation phases, ensuring modulated control of memory operations.
