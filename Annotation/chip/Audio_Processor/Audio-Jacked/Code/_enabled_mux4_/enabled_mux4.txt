Module-level comment: This module, 'enabled_mux4', functions as a 4-way enabled multiplexer acting on REGBITS wide inputs a-d, directed by the 'control' signal. Monitored by an 'always' block, if 'reset' is high, output 'e' resets; if 'enable' is high and 'reset' isn't, 'e' updates to reflect intermediate output 'e_o'. It's a generic module that caters to any bit-width due to the parameter REGBITS.
