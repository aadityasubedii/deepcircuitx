    "block_comment": "This block of code is a control logic for a system/module in a design operating on a reset and enable signal. When the reset signal is high, the `e` register is reset to 0, effectively initializing or resetting state. When reset is not asserted and the enable signal is high, the `e` is reassigned the value of `e_o`. Through this mechanism, the existing value of `e` can be replaced by `e_o` under controlled conditions."
