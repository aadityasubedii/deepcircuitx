    "spec": "Module name: enabled_mux4. \n\nModule specification: This module is named 'enabled_mux4', representing a 4-way multiplexer with an enable functionality. It performs the operation of selecting one of the four input-lines; a, b, c, or d. The selection is determined based on the bits of the 'control' input. The chosen input is sent to the output 'e' if the 'enable' signal is high and 'reset' signal is low. If the 'reset' signal is high, the 'e' output is reset while the 'enable' signal being low maintains the previous value of 'e'. \n\nThe input ports of this module are clk (clock synchronized across the circuit), reset (resets 'e' output when active), a, b, c, and d (four input lines for multiplexing operation), control (2-bit signal deciding input-line to select), and enable (permits updating of 'e' value). The module has a single output port 'e', delivering the selected and possibly edited multiplexer output. \n\nThe module utilizes 'e_o' as its internal signal - a temporary data holder for the mux4 instance's output. The 'e_o' takes the selected input's value and assigns it to 'e' per the 'reset' and 'enable' signal conditions. \n\nThe code is divided into blocks including module parameter initialization, mux4 instance declaration named 'dataupdate', and the 'always' block. The 'always' block monitors changes in signals to determine the value of the 'e' output based on states of 'reset' and 'enable' signals. The module inherently offers the generic attribute of handling arbitrary bit-width data due to the default REGBITS parameter.",
