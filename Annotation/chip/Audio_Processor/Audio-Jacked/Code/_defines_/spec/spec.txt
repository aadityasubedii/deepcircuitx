Unfortunately, we cannot commit to this procedure because the code snippet provided does not include a fully defined module. The given code is comprised of preprocessor directives which define a set of constants to be used in Verilog programming. 

A module declaration in Verilog typically starts with the keyword `module` followed by its name, ports, and body, but it is not evident in the provided code. 

Furthermore, without a module declaration, we are unable to identify any input/output ports or internal signals to explain. These features are module-dependent, thus, necessitating a specified module for further assessment.

The blocks or sections of the code presented here are simply defining a set of constants probably to be used elsewhere in the Verilog program, specifically within processing modules or state machines. 

For a comprehensive and detailed overview of a module's design and operation along with the specifications you requested (module name, functionality, inputs/outputs, internal signals, code structure), you would need to provide an actual Verilog module code. Once we have a complete module at our disposal, we can deliver a thorough analysis based on the module's implementation and structure.
