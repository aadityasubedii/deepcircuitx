Module-level comment: The 'mux4' is a 4-way multiplexer implemented in Verilog. It selects and outputs one of the four REGBITS wide inputs (a,b,c,d) based on a 2-bit control signal. The selection logic is implemented using an always @(*) block with a case statement, which assigns the selected input to the output 'e'. In case of unexpected control signals, the output defaults to input 'a'.
