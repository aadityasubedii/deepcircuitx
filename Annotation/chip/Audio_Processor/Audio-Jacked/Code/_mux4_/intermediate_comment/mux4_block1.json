    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a multiplexer (MUX) using a control system. Based on the value of the control signal, it selects and routes one of the four inputs (a, b, c, d) to the output (e). Specifically, when the control signal is '00', '01', '10', or '11', it assigns the value of 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd' to 'e', respectively. If the control signal is anything other than these four options, it defaults to assigning the value of 'a' to 'e'.\n"
