This module receives four input signals named a, b, c, and d, which are REGBITS wide (parameter defaulted to 4 bits). It also takes a 2-bit control signal. Depending on the control signal's value (binary values '00', '01', '10', '11'), it selects and outputs the value of one of the inputs ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd') in output 'e'. In case of any different value, it defaults to input 'a'. The selected input's value is made available on the output bitstream 'e', which is also REGBITS wide. There are no internal signals used in this module; all computations are performed directly with the input and output signals. The logic is implemented within the always @(*) block, where the control signal's value is evaluated with a case statement, and the corresponding action (setting 'e' to a, b, c, d, or 'a', by default) is performed.",
