The inputs are 'clock', 'clear' signals, and four 4-bit data inputs labelled 'data0', 'data1', 'data2', and 'data3'. The module cycles through these four data inputs at different time intervals represented by ticks, which increment with each positive edge of the clock. \n\nThe 'ticks' counter resets either when 'clear' is asserted or it exceeds 800,000. The selected data is stored in 'digit'. Depending on the value of 'ticks', one of the 'enable' bits is set to 0 and respective data is displayed. \n\nIn the second 'always' block, a case statement is used to assign the binary values to 'segs' corresponding to the decimal value to be displayed on the 7-segment display. The decimal values range from 0 to 15, which corresponds to hexadecimal system, and for other input values, a default assignment is provided. The 'decimal' output is hardwired to 1 in this module."
