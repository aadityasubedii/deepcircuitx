    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'LED_7SEG' module drives a 7-segment LED display, cycling through four 4-bit inputs ('data0' to 'data3') using a clock-aligned 'ticks' counter that resets on 'clear' signal or at 800,000 ticks. The selected data is stored in 'digit', displayed on LED through 'segs', and controlled by 'enable' bits. 'decimal' is a constant-output port and 'segs' provides binary patterns. The cycle time is defined by 'ticks' facilitating the illusion of simultaneous representation of all data inputs."
