    "spec": "Module name: LED_7SEG. \n\nModule specification: The 'LED_7SEG' is a RTL Verilog module, designed to drive a 7-segment LED display. It sequentially represents four 4-bit data inputs, namely 'data0', 'data1', 'data2', and 'data3', and switches between them based on the counter 'ticks'. The 'ticks' increments at every positive edge of the input 'clock' and resets either if 'clear' signal is asserted or surpasses 800,000. The currently selected data is stored in 'digit', and one of the 'enable' bits is set to 0 to display the respective data on the LED. 'decimal' output is set to constant 1 and 'enable' and 'segs' are 4-bit and 7-bit registers respectively. 'segs' provide a digital pattern for displaying the current 'digit' value on 7-segment LED, governed by a case statement inside an 'always' block. Each input data is cyclically displayed for a defined timespan, influencing the user perception of continuously changing data on LED. The overall operation is synchronous to the input clock ensuring operational stability and robustness.",
