This block serves as a 7-segment display decoder for a hexadecimal input. It uses a case statement to map a 4-bit hexadecimal digit (0-15) to a 7-bit binary pattern that corresponds to the lit segments of a 7-segment display for that digit. For unknown or unpredictable inputs (`default`), this block defaults the `segs` variable to a specific binary value. This mapping logic is encapsulated within an `always` block, meaning a change in the `digit` variable would trigger a new evaluation of the case logic.
