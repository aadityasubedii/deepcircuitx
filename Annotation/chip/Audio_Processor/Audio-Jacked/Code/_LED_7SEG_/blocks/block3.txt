Comment: 
This block of Verilog code implements a clock divider/scale down function. The function keeps track of clock ticks and resets to zero upon reaching a specific tick count or upon a high 'clear' signal. Using a sequential 'always' block, the counter increases by one with every clock cycle when the 'clear' signal is not asserted. The counter resets to zero either when the 'clear' signal is asserted or when the 'ticks' cross a threshold of 800000, providing the scaled-down clock frequency.
