Comment: 
The block controls output digit value and digit selection based on a 'ticks' counter. The block uses combinational always@(*) implementation to respond to real-time changes. Initially, digit and enable are set to default values ('h0 and 'hF). However, based on the interval in which 'ticks' falls, the digit adopts a different data value (e.g., data0, data1, etc.), and the corresponding enable position is set to zero, allowing selection of the appropriate digit for a particular time period.
