    "block_comment": "The code block serves as a state machine for instruction processing in a CPU-like system. On system reset or whenever 'reset' is high, it goes to the 'INSTUP' state and counter reset is set to zero. If not reset, it stays in the current state and the next state is decided based on the current state and sometimes additional condition checks. Various states represent different stages of instruction processing such as fetching, decoding and executing different types of operations like register operations, conditional and unconditional jumps, loads, stores, shifts, and others. Each opcode or extension can cause a transition to a distinct execution state. State transitions are mainly done through case statements. The block also handles some particular stall conditions where it waits for 'cr_ready' signal to be high to proceed from 'WRSTALL' and 'RDSTALL' states."
