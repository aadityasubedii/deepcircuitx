    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is implementing a state machine transition. Whenever there's a rising edge (or positive edge) detected on the 'clk' (clock) signal, this procedural block will assign the value of 'nextstate' to the 'state' variable, thus transitioning the state machine to its next state."
