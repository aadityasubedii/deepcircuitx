    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThis `controller` module functions as the main control unit within a CPU, creating control signals based on the opcode and CPU state. It employs input signals to guide operations, branching conditions, instruction specifics, and memory statuses. Output signals then govern ALU, memory, branching, register operations, instruction writing, PC updating, and more. Internally, the module uses specific signals to manage its current state and next state transitions, alongside mnemonics for different operation modes within the CPU. The module operates both synchronously with the clock and combinatorially for control logic, employing a substantial state machine to facilitate varying CPU states, opcode decoding, I/O handling, memory operations, and branching."
