This block is a state machine that instructs how the processor should respond at different stages of fetching and executing a given instruction. The state transitions are signified by specify keywords used within a case statement, where each case represents a specific state in the machine state. The block executes distinct instruction sequences for each declared state, consisting of memory engagement, register and memory writing, datapath control, and condition flags updating. Some operations performed involve data to specific registers, or control signals such as instruction fetch, decode, and execution stages. Also, conditions are checked to determine if certain signals need to be flagged or certain actions should be performed, and enable signals are assigned for memory or program counter operations. Lastly, this block utilizes Verilog's simulation feature for debugging purposes and output specific runtime information when certain conditions are met.
