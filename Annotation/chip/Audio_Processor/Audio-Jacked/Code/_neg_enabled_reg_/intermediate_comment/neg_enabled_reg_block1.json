    "block_comment": "This block of code provides reset and enable functionality for the \"b\" flip-flop. On each positive edge of the clock signal, it checks if the reset signal is active. If so, it resets the value of \"b\" to 0. If the reset signal is not active, the block then checks if the enable signal is active. If so, the value of \"a\" is written to \"b\" at the next positive clock edge."
