Module-level comment: This 'neg_enabled_reg' is a parameterized Verilog module that performs as a negative enabled register, defaulting to a 16-bit width. It has inputs 'clk' (clock), 'reset', 'enable', and 'a' (data). It triggers on the clock's positive edge; resets on a high reset signal (setting 'b' to zero), and if 'enable' is high and 'reset' is not, it assigns 'a' to 'b'. No internal signals are used, and output is straightforwardly controlled by the inputs following the clock signal. Its procedural code, encapsulated by 'always @(posedge clk)', delivers this functionality.
