Module name: neg_enabled_reg. 

Module specification: This is a parameterized module designed to handle specific width data, defaulting at 16 bits. The primary functionality of the neg_enabled_reg module is to describe a negative enabled register. This module operates on the positive edge of the clock signal and resets when the reset signal is asserted. While in the reset state, the output 'b' is set to zero. However, if the reset signal is not high and the enable signal is asserted, the value of input 'a' is assigned to output 'b', thus acting as a storage element controlled by the clock, reset, and enable signals. The input ports include the clk, reset, enable, and 'a'. Here, clk represents the clock signal, reset provides the reset input, enable is for enabling the register, and 'a' serves as the input data. The output port is 'b', which holds the value of 'a' or 0 depends on the state of reset and enable. No internal signals are used in this module. Furthermore, the module consists of a primary procedural block, 'always @(posedge clk)', used to determine the output 'b' based on reset and enable signals' state following the clock signal's positive edge. The module is simple and efficient, embodying a robust design structure for handling a register with negative enable functionality.
