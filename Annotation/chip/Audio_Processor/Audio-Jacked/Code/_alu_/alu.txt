Module-level comment: The 'alu' module is a 16-bit parametric arithmetic logic unit performing a variety of bitwise and arithmetic operations. Inputs 'alu_in1', 'alu_in2' and control signals 'alucont' drive the functionality. Internal signals and combinational logic generate results based on 'alucont'. The outputs include 'result', carry, zero flags, and overflow indicator. The 'always' block leverages a case statement on 'alucont' to select operation. This architecture implements quick, flexible processing in a single module.
