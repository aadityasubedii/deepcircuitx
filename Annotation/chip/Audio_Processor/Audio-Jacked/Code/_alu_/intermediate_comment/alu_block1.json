    "block_comment": "This block is implemented as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that performs various bitwise and arithmetic operations. Depending on the 3-bit control code (alucont[2:0]), this block uses a case statement to determine the operational function, performing operations like AND, OR, addition, providing input pass-through, XOR, negation, add-with-carry, multiplication or a default null operation if none recognized. The operands for these operations are 'alu_in1' and 'alu_in2'."
