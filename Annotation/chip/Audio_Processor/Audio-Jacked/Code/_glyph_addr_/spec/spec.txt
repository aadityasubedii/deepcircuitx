Module name: glyph_addr. Module specification: The glyph_addr module generates memory addresses for displaying glyphs (characters or symbols) on a display. It takes inputs for clock (clk), reset (rst), 4-bit vertical count (vcnt), and 6-bit glyph number (glyph), and outputs a 10-bit address. The module uses an internal 10-bit register (cur_add) to store the calculated address. The address calculation is performed in an always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock. The module uses a case statement to determine the address based on the glyph number and vertical count, with a base offset of 150. The calculated address is then assigned to the output through a continuous assignment. The module supports up to 46 different glyphs (0 to 45), each with 16 vertical positions (0 to 15). For each g
