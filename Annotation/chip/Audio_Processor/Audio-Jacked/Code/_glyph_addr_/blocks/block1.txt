This block calculates memory addresses for displaying glyphs on a display. It determines the current address (cur_add) based on the glyph number and vertical count (vcnt). The block uses a base address of 150 and offsets it by the glyph number and vertical count to access specific memory locations for each glyph and row. The implementation uses a case statement to handle different glyph numbers (0-16) and nested if-else statements to process each vertical count (0-15) within each glyph, resulting in a memory addressing scheme for a 16x16 glyph display system.
