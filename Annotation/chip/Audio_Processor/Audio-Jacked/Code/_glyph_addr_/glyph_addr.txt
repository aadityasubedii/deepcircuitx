Module-level comment: 
/*
This module generates memory addresses for displaying glyphs on a display.
It calculates a 10-bit address based on the input glyph number (0-45) and
vertical count (0-15), with a base offset of 150. The address is updated
on each clock cycle and reset to 150 when the reset signal is active.
The module uses a case statement to handle different glyph numbers and
a series of if-else statements for each vertical position.
