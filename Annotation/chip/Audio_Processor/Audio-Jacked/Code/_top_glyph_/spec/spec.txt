Module name: top_glyph. 

Module specification: 

The 'top_glyph' is a top-level module that seemingly integrates and interfaces with other sub-modules to manage addresses, menu and progress count. It operates based on input signals and generates specific outputs related to memory addressing and program counting.

The module has the following input and output ports:

Input ports:
1. 'clk': Clock signal controlling the system operations' timing.
2. 'rst': Reset signal used to initialize the system or sub-system to a defined state. 
3. 'hcnt' and 'vcnt': 10-bit signals representing the horizontal and vertical counts, potentially for GUI applications.
4. 'menu': 2-bit input signal possibly used for selecting different menu options.
5. 'filter': 3-bit input signal which may indicate different filter functionalities or modes.

Output Ports:
1. 'address': 24-bit signal used for resource or memory addressing.
2. 'prg_cnt': 6-bit output counter signal, potentially representing a program counter or an incremental counter.

There are three internal signals:

1. 'i': A 6-bit arithmetic index indicating an incremental or looping operation.
2. 'glyph': A 14-bit signal associated with the GUI or graphical components.
3. 'glyph_address': A 10-bit signal used in address generation related to graphical components.

The module consists of three primary blocks: The 'glyph_addr' block, which manages the addresses related to the GUI components represented by 'glyph'. The 'menus' block which interacts with the 'menu' input and possibly organizes the GUI according to specific instructions derived from 'hcnt', 'vcnt', 'menu', and 'filter' inputs and the 'progress_cnt' block, which might be handling program control sequences. Thus, the module ensures integration between different sub-modules and detailed management of GUI components, on-screen menus, and program counts.
