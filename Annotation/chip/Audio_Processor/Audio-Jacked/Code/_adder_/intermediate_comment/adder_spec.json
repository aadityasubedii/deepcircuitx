Module specification: The 'adder' module operates as a basic arithmetic unit that utilizes the functionality of a parameterized Verilog hardware description language (HDL). The main purpose of this module is to carry out the addition operation on two binary numbers of width defined by the parameter 'WIDTH'. The module has two inputs: 'a' and 'b'; and one output: 'c'. The input ports 'a' and 'b' serve as the operands for the addition operation. They are both binary vectors whose size is determined by the 'WIDTH' parameter. The sum of 'a' and 'b' is computed in the module and the result is reflected at the output port 'c', which is also a binary vector with its size being controlled by the 'WIDTH' parameter. The module doesn't utilize any internal signals as it directly assigns the output 'c' to the sum of inputs 'a' and 'b'. The Verilog RTL code for the 'adder' module consists of a single, continuous block that executes the addition operation.",
