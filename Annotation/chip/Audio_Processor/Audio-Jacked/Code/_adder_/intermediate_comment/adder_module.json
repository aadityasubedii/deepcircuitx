    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'adder' module performs addition of two binary numbers. The operands 'a' and 'b', as well as the sum 'c', have a size defined by 'WIDTH'. This functionality is achieved directly without using internal signals, making the module simple and efficient. The input operands are added and the result is assigned directly to the output in a single, continuous hardware block."
