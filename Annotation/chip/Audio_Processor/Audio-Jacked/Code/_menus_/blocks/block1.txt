[Function of the block]: This block generates a display pattern for a menu interface, controlling the appearance of glyphs on a screen based on the current menu selection and screen coordinates.

[Implementation details of the block]: The block uses a synchronous always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock. It handles different menu states ('d0, 'd1, 'd2) and uses nested conditional statements to set glyph values based on horizontal (hcnt) and vertical (vcnt) counters. The glyph values are assigned to specific screen positions to create text, borders, and interactive elements for each menu state.
