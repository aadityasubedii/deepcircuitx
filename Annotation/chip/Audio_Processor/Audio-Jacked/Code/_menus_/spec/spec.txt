Module name: menus. Module specification: The menus module is responsible for generating glyphs (visual elements) for different menu screens or interfaces in a display system. It takes several input ports: clk (clock signal), rst (reset signal), i[5:0] (likely for menu item selection), hcnt[9:0] and vcnt[9:0] (horizontal and vertical counters for screen coordinates), menu[1:0] (menu state selection), and filter[2:0] (filter option selection). The module outputs a 14-bit glyph[13:0] signal, where the lower 8 bits represent pixel coordinates and the upper 6 bits likely represent different visual elements or characters to be displayed. The module does not use any explicit internal signals. It consists of two main always blocks: one for updating the lower 8 bits of the glyph output based on screen coordinates, and another
