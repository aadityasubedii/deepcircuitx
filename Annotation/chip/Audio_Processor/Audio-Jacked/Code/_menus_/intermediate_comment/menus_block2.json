    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a hardware register module. The module stores and updates the value of an 8-bit register, 'glyph', on each rising edge of the input clock signal. If the reset signal (rst) is high, the register is reset and all its bits are set to 0. If the reset signal is not high, the register takes the values from the lower half of two 4-bit counter registers, hcnt and vcnt. The new value of 'glyph' is then given by the concatenation of the 4 bits from hcnt and the 4 bits from vcnt."
