    "block_comment": "This code block manages memory data read and write for a MIPS architecture using Verilog. It gets activated at the positive edge of clk (clock signal) when \"en\" (enable signal) is high. It checks if \"memwrite\" is true to write the \"writedata\" to the RAM at the specified address \"adr\" and whether or not there was a write operation, the data from the address \"adr\" is read to \"memdata\"."
