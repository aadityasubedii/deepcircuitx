Explanation: The exmem module is used for read and write operations to a simulated RAM block, named mips_ram. The size of the RAM and the data width are configurable using `RAM_ADDR_BITS` and `WIDTH` parameters respectively. The module reads data from a text file (\"application.txt\") and initializes the RAM during the initial block stage. During each positive clock cycle, if the enable signal `en` is high, the module checks the memory write signal `memwrite`. If `memwrite` is high, the module writes the input data `writedata` to the RAM at the location specified by `adr`. Whether or not data was written, the module always reads the data at the `adr` location of the RAM and outputs it as `memdata`."
