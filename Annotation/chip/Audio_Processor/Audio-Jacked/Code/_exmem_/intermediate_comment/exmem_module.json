    "module": "Module-level comment: The exmem module is a memory controller, managing read/write operations to a simulated RAM block, mips_ram. It uses input signals (clk, en, memwrite, adr, writedata) to control operations: on the positive clock edge, if 'en' is high, 'writedata' is written to 'mips_ram' at 'adr' if 'memwrite' is high; 'mips_ram[adr]' is read out to 'memdata'. Data width and memory size are configurable. Initial RAM data is from \"application.txt\"."
