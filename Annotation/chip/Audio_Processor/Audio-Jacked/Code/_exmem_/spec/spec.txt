Module name: exmem. 

Module specification: The exmem module is an essential part of a memory management system, handling read and write operations to a simulated memory block, named mips_ram. The RAM includes configurable parameters for data width (`WIDTH`) and RAM size (`RAM_ADDR_BITS`). The RAM unit is initially populated with data from a text file named "application.txt". Data read/write operations are controlled by the clock signal (`clk`), an enable signal (`en`), a write indicator signal (`memwrite`), a memory address signal (`adr`), and input data signal (`writedata`). These confirm input ports of the module. On each positive edge of the clock signal, when `en` is enabled, the module checks the `memwrite` signal. If it indicates a write operation (if high), `writedata` is written to the `mips_ram` at the specified `adr`. Regardless of whether a write operation has occurred, data from the `adr` in the `mips_ram` is always read and sent to the output port `memdata`. The module's internal signals only include `mips_ram`, which is a register array acting as the system's memory block. The primary sections of the code initialize the memory array with data from a text file and handle data read and write operations on addressing and data availability. This module hence functions as an effective memory controller in the system, performing read and write operations based on various control signals.
