If the most significant bit of the 'immediate' input is 1, the module pads 'immediate' with 16 bits of 1's in its higher order bits. If the most significant bit of the 'immediate' input is 0, it pads 'immediate' with 16 bits of 0's at its higher order bits. This operation is typically used to maintain the numerical value of a negative number when the number's bit-width is increased."

Explanation: 'extended' is the output signal which reflects the result of the sign-extension operation done on 'immediate'. It is of twice the size of 'immediate', or specifically, 2*WIDTH bits. According to the most significant bit of the 'immediate' signal, the higher order 16 bits are padded with either all zeros (if the MSB is 0) or all ones (if the MSB is 1), maintaining the same signed value when 'immediate' bit-width is increased."
