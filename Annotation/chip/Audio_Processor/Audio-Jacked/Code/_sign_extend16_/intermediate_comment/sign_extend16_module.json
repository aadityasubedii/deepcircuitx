    "module": "Module-level comment: The sign_extend16 module performs sign extension on its 'immediate' input, which is 'WIDTH' bits wide (default 16). It generates an 'extended' output of twice the input width. Depending on the most significant bit of 'immediate', it either pads 16 zeros or 16 ones to the higher order bits of 'immediate'. The module doesn't use internal signals; operations are performed directly on input and output ports. The result is a sign-extended output that keeps the same numerical signed value on bit-width increase."
