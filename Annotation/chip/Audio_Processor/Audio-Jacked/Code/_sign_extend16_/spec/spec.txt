Module name: sign_extend16. 

Module specification: The sign_extend16 module, parameterized with a default width of 16 bits for the input, performs sign extension on the input signal 'immediate'. Its primary function is to maintain the numerical value of a signed number when the number's bit-width is increased. If the most significant bit of the 'immediate' input is 1, the module pads 'immediate' with 16 bits of 1's in its higher order bits. If the most significant bit is 0, it pads 'immediate' with 16 bits of 0's at its higher order bits. 

Input port is 'immediate', represented by WIDTH bits, on which sign-extension operation is performed. The output port is 'extended', twice the size of 'immediate', or 2*WIDTH bits, which represents the result of the sign-extension operation. Depending on the most significant bit of the 'immediate' signal, the higher order 16 bits of 'extended' are padded with either all zeros (when the MSB is 0) or all ones (when the MSB is 1). 

The module does not have any internal signals and no specific blocks or sections as the operation is performed directly on the input and output ports. The assignment of the extended signal is performed directly from the immediate input using conditional operators. The well-structured and straightforward design makes this module efficient and reliable for sign-extension functionalities.
