This block of code functions as a counter with reset capability. With basically driven by the system clock (`s_clk`), the operation of the block is straightforward. If a reset (`rst`) is invoked, the counter `LR_count` and `LR_clk` resets their values to zero. Without reset, the counter increments at each clock cycle until hitting a certain limit defined by (`DIN_W-1)*LR_SAM`) and then resets itself. For all other cases, the counter retains its value. This block mainly helps to synchronize operations within the system based on the defined limit.
