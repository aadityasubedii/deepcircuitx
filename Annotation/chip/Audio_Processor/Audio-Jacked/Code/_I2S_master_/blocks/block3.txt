This block of Verilog code acts as a clock divider. The code is implemented as an always block that is sensitive to the rising edge of the system clock (clk). If the reset signal (rst) is high, the clock output (m_clk) is reset to 0. If the reset signal is not high, the clock output is toggled between 0 and 1 on every rising edge of the system clock.
