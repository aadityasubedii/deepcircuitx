This block updates the value of 's_max' variable every positive edge of the clock signal 'clk'. The value of 's_max' is calculated as the product of 'FPGA_CLK' and 'LR_SAM', divided by twice the product of 'Fs' and 'DIN_W'. The block relies on the sensitivity list to trigger the sequential update of 's_max' only at the positive rising edge of the clock.
