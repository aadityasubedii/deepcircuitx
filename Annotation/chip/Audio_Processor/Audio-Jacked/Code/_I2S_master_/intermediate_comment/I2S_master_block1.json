    "block_comment": "This block of code acts as a clock divider circuitry. It operates by counting the clock cycles using the `s_count` signal up to a maximum limit `s_max` and then resets the count. When `s_count` reaches `s_max`, the `s_clk` signal is toggled, effectively halving the clock frequency. In case a reset (`rst`) is detected at the positive edge of the clock (`clk`), both the `s_count` and `s_clk` are reset to 0. Thus, it ensures periodicity and clock division based on predefined maximum count."
