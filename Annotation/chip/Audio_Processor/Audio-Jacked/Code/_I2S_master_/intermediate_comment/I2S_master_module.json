    "module": "Module-level comment: The I2S_master module is an Inter-IC Sound (I2S) protocol master generating timing and handshaking signals based on a provided clock (clk) and audio data (data_in). Upon reset (rst), the module enters the IDLE state, transitioning between CHANNEL_0 and CHANNEL_1 states as per a state machine logic. Within channel states, it manipulates data_in into an I2S compliant data_out driven by internal counters (LR_count, shift_count_0, shift_count_1), triggers the DONE signal at frame end, and produces m_clk, LR_clk, and s_clk signals synchronized with the input clk. State transitions and output updates happen upon clock edges."
