    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a sequential circuit with clock ('clk') and reset ('rst') inputs. By being triggered on a positive edge clock cycle, it handles state transitions within the system. If 'reset' is active, it sets the present state ('PS') to an idle state. Otherwise, it allows transitions to the next state ('NS') as determined by the main control logic of the system. The system will stay in a state until either a reset signal or a clock cycle updates the state. It acknowledges both synchronous reset and standby mode for power saving which maintains its IDLE state until an event triggers a state change."
