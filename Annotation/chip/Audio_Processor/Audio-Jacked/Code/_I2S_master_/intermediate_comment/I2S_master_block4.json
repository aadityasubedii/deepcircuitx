    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a state machine which reacts on the falling edge of 's_clk'. The state machine operates in three states - IDLE, CHAN_0 and CHAN_1, and shifts data based on these states. In IDLE state, it clears 'shift_count' and 'data_out'. In CHAN_0 state, it increments 'shift_count_0' until it reaches the width of 'data_in' minus one, at each increment, it shifts the data_in value assigned to 'data_out'. If 'shift_count_0' exceeds the limit, it resets 'shift_count_0' and 'data_out', and similarly for the CHAN_1 state but with variable 'shift_count_1'. Once either 'shift_count_0' or 'shift_count_1' reaches 15, the 'DONE' flag is set."
