    "block_comment": "This block is a state machine for managing channel changes on a system. The operation of this chunk of code is tied to the positive edge of the system clock. Anytime there's a rising edge in the clock signal, the code evaluates the present state (PS) of the system. Three defined states exist: IDLE, CHAN_0, and CHAN_1. In IDLE state, the next state (NS) is automatically set to CHAN_0. During CHAN_0 state, if a counter shift_count_0 equals 15, it switches to CHAN_1, otherwise, it stays on CHAN_0. The third state, CHAN_1, mirrors CHAN_0 state, but utilizes shift_count_1. If shift_count_1 equals 15, the system returns to CHAN_0, otherwise, it remains on CHAN_1."
