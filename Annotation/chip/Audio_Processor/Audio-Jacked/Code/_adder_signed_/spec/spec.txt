Module name: adder_signed. Module specification: The 'adder_signed' module is a straightforward and efficient designed hardware for the purpose of performing the addition operation on two signed numbers. This module takes two signed numbers 'a' and 'b' as inputs. The width of both inputs are determined by the parameter 'WIDTH', which makes the module versatile for different bit width requirements. The result of the addition operation, which is also a signed number with the same width 'WIDTH', is assigned directly to output 'c'. Intriguingly, the module doesn't have any internal signals or further complex internal hardware design, the addition operation is performed directly on the input signals, and the output is directly assigned. Very straightforwardly, it illustrates the ideal example of an adder in the hardware design scenario.
