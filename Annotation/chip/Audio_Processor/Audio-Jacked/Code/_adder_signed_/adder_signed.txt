Module-level comment: The 'adder_signed' module performs the addition of two signed inputs 'a' and 'b'. The bit width of these inputs is determined by the parameter 'WIDTH'. The result is directly assigned to the output 'c', having the same width 'WIDTH'. The operation is straightforward with no internal signals used; addition is performed directly on inputs, and the result is directly generated on the output. This module exemplifies a simple and efficient hardware adder design.
