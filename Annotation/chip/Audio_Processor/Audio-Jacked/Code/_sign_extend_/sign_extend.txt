Module-level comment: This module, sign_extend, implements sign extension on a given input `immediate` of default `WIDTH` 16 bits, which is a parameter that can be customized. It outputs the sign-extended result `extended` of a `WIDTH+8` bit width. Depending on the MSB value of `immediate`, either '1's or '0's are assigned to the top 8 bits of `extended`, reflecting the two's complement representation. No internal signals are used; the logic is directly applied to the input-output pair. The sign extension is performed via an `assign` statement with conditional construct.
