The width of the input is determined by the parameter `WIDTH` which is set to 16 by default. The sign-extended result is output as `extended`, whose width is `WIDTH+8`. If the most significant bit of `immediate` is 1 (negative value in signed representation), the upper 8 bits of the extended value are filled with '1's (or 8'hff), representing negative in two's complement form. Otherwise, the upper 8 bits are filled with '0's (or 8'h00)."

In this code, all the logic is performed directly with the input and output signals (i.e., 'immediate' and 'extended'). All of the operations apply directly to the inputs to produce the outputs, without any intermediate wires or registers for storing signal states. Hence, your answers would be:\n\nInternal signals: None. Explanation: No internal signals are used in this module."
