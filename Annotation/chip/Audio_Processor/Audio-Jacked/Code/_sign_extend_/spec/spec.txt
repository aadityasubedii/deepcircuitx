Module name: sign_extend. 

Module specification: The sign_extend is a versatile hardware module takes an `immediate` input value with a default width of 16 bits (which can be adjusted using the `WIDTH` parameter) and generates a sign-extended output `extended` with a width of `WIDTH+8` bits. The functionality of this module is straightforward - it extends the sign of the input immediate data. If the most significant bit (MSB) of `immediate` is '1', the upper 8 bits of `extended` are set as '1's, otherwise, those bits are set as '0's. This aligned with the two's complement representation. The input port is `immediate`, which is the number to be sign-extended, and the output port is `extended`, which is the sign-extended version of the input data. The module does not use any internal signals, as all operations are directly performed on the input and output signals without any intermediary steps. The module comprises the parameter and port declarations, and an `assign` statement which carries out the sign extension. The sign extension mechanism employs conditional logic (`immediate[WIDTH-1] ? :`) to assign the upper bits based on the MSB of the `immediate`.
