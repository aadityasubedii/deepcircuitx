    "block_comment": "The provided block of code will be used to implement a condition evaluator in a digital system. It employs a combinational always block representing case statements with multiple conditions (`EQ`, `NE`, `GE`, `CS`, `CC`, `HI`, `LS`, `LO`, `HS`, `GRT`, `LE`, `FS`, `FC`, `LT`, `UC`, `AT`), made possible through Verilog's `case` construct, providing an exhaustive list of binary scenarios for `code_met` based on the state of the digital signals (`Z`, `N`, `C`, `L`, `F`). This block can be used in larger designs where these specific condition codes are needed to generate particular outputs."
