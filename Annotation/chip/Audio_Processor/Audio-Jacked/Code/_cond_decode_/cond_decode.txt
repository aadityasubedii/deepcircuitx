Module-level comment: The 'cond_decode' module functions as a condition decoder, taking a 4-bit condition code and several flags (C, L, F, N, Z) as inputs, and determines if the condition is met. An output 'code_met' is set to '1' if met, otherwise '0'. The module uses an always block with a case statement for combinational analysis of flag signals against the conditions specified by 'cond_code'. No internal signals are used - all are inputs or the output.
