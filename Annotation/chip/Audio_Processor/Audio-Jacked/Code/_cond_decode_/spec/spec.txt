Module name: cond_decode. 

Module specification: The 'cond_decode' is a hardware design module represented in Verilog RTL, with a prime functionality of decoding condition codes and adjusting the 'code_met' output based on the decoded conditions and several flag inputs. The input ports of this module are the flags 'C', 'L', 'F', 'N', 'Z', and a 4-bit 'cond_code', which specify the condition to be checked. The flags act as control signals determining the conditions described by the case statement inside the always block of this module. There is one output port 'code_met', a register which portrays if a condition is met by displaying '1' if met and '0' if not. The module doesn't contain any internal signals. All signals are either input or output ports. The module majorly comprises of an always block conducting a combination comparison of flag signals against various conditions, subsequently adjusting 'code_met' output. This module is a simple yet powerful tool to compare the status of multiple flags against a set of predefined conditions, furnishing a comprehensive condition check feature to your hardware design.
