    "block_comment": "This block is a state machine for managing menu interactions and setting filter values in a digital system. The block responds to a clock signal and adjusts menu and filter states based on the current state input. There are six main states representing three menus and their corresponding wait states. In each state, the 'menu_in' is set according to the desired menu (00 for Menu1, 01 for Menu2, and 10 for Menu3), and 'filter' is managed accordingly. In the 'menu3' state, the 'filter' is further set according to the conditions of 'filter1' through 'filter4'. In any other state, the default settings for 'menu_in' and 'filter' are applied."
