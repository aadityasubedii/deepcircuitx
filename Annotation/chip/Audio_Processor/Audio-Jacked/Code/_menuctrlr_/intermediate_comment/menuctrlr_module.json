    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'menuctrlr' Verilog module serves as a touch-based menu controller. By interpreting inputs such as 'menu2_cnt' and touch coordinates, it sets 2-bit 'menu_in' (current menu selection) and 3-bit 'filter' (filter selection) as outputs. The module employs a Finite State Machine driven by internal signals like 'record', 'stop', 'record_new', 'no_touch', 'end_progress_bar', and 'filter1-4'. These signals respond to specific touch regions and the 'menu2_cnt' value. The internal state transitions and output assignments occur on the rising clock edge."
