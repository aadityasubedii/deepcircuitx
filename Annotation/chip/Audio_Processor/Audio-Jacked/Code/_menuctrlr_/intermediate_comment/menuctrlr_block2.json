    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the transition of states in a state machine. It's triggered at the rising edge of a clock signal. If a reset is detected, it forces the present_state to return to a predefined condition, 'menu1'. Otherwise, present_state advances to the value held in 'next_state'. This approach ensures synchronization with the clock signal, and enables controllable state reset."
