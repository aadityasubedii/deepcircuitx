Module name: menuctrlr. 

Module specification: The 'menuctrlr' is a hardware module defined in Verilog, designed to serve as a controller for a menu system in a hardware design. The module drives a menu interface by interpreting touch screen inputs in comparison to predefined touch regions and a 'menu2_cnt' value. 

The module has several inputs including a clock signal 'clk', a reset signal 'reset', a 6-bit 'menu2_cnt', and three 12-bit touch coordinates 'tp_x', 'tp_y', 'tp_z'. The 'clk' signal is used for synchronizing the logic design, 'reset' for bringing the system back to its initial or a specific state, and 'menu2_cnt' is a counter potentially measuring a certain feature of the menu. The touchpoint values 'tp_x', 'tp_y', 'tp_z' represent coordinates on a touchscreen, dictating system progression. 

The module outputs 2-bit 'menu_in', suggesting the presently selected menu, and 3-bit 'filter', indicating the selected filter. 

Internally, the module uses signals like 'record', 'stop', 'record_new', 'no_touch', 'end_progress_bar', 'filter1', 'filter2', 'filter3', 'filter4', and states 'present_state', 'next_state' to govern its functionality, using concepts like touch regions, Finite State Machine (FSM), and conditional assignments. 

The Verilog code is divided into blocks to:
1. Define module and its ports.
2. Declare internal signals.
3. Assign specific functionalities to the internal signals.
4. Define current and next states of the FSM, and the corresponding state transitions.
5. At the positive edge of the clock pulse, the 'present_state' of the FSM is updated.
6. Also at the positive edge of the clock pulse, the outputs 'menu_in' and 'filter' are set depending on the 'present_state'. 

Overall, based on the touchscreen inputs, 'menu2_cnt' value, and reset conditions, the states and signals are processed with the FSM, resulting in the establishment of an active menu and filter.
