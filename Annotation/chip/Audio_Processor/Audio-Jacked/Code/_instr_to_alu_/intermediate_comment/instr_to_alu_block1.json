    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to set the operation code (opcode) for the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) based on the input opcode (op_hi and op_lo). It uses an always block and nested case statements to determine the ALU opcode; the outer case statement checks the opcode of the high byte (op_hi) and the inner case statement handles the lower byte (op_lo) for 'REGISTER'. Different opcodes exist for various arithmetic and bitwise operations like ADD, MUL, SUB, CMP, AND, OR, XOR which assign specific 4-bit patterns to the 'alu_op'. If no match is found, the alu_op defaults to the opcode of 'CMP'."
