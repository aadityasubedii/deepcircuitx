It takes a \"WIDTH\"-wide opcode as input, divides it into 'op_hi' and 'op_lo', and translates them to 'alu_op'. This output 'alu_op' is used to control the corresponding operation in the ALU. For example: `ADD` or `SUB` operations have different 'alu_op'. Different instruction cases for operations like 'REGISTER', 'ADDI', 'MULI', 'ANDI', 'ORI', 'SUBI', etc., are handled. The 'REGISTER' operation further branches into several other possible operations based on 'op_lo'. In cases where the input opcode does not match any predefined operations, a default 'alu_op' is assigned."
