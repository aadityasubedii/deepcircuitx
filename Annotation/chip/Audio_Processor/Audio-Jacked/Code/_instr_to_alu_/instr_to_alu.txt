Module-level comment: The 'instr_to_alu' module translates instruction opcode inputs ('op_hi' and 'op_lo') to the corresponding ALU operation code ('alu_op'). The translation is performed through evaluating case statements depending on input opcode values, handling operations like 'REGISTER', 'ADDI', 'MULI', 'ANDI', 'ORI', 'SUBI', etc. For unmatched opcode, a default 'alu_op' code is assigned. No internal signals are used, and the primary blocks of code revolve around the nested case statements that generate the 'alu_op' code.
