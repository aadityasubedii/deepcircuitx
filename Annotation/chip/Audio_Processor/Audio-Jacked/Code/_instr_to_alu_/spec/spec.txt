Module name: instr_to_alu.

Module specification: The instr_to_alu module in Verilog serves as a translator from incoming instruction opcode (operation code) to the required ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) operation code. It accepts two input ports, namely 'op_hi' (the higher 4 bits of the opcode) to categorize the type of instruction, and 'op_lo' (the lower 4 bits of the opcode), which is used to refine the instruction when the 'op_hi' is of the type `REGISTER`. The module outputs through the 'alu_op' port, an operation code intended to control the specific operation in the ALU. Its value is generated through evaluation within case statements in the module, with distinct codes for operations such as ADD, SUB, CMP, AND, OR, XOR etc. A default 'alu_op' is assigned when the 'op_hi' or 'op_lo' inputs do not match any predefined operations. The module does not use any internal signals. The main code blocks include multiple case statements that operate based on 'op_hi' and 'op_lo' values, producing specific 'alu_op' codes to control the ALU. The module is designed to handle instructions for operations such as 'REGISTER', 'ADDI', 'MULI', 'ANDI', 'ORI', 'SUBI' and more, providing efficient and streamlined functionality in handling processor instructions.
