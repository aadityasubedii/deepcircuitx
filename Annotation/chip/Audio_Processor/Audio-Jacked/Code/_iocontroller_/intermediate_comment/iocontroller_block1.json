    "block_comment": "This block of code depicts memory addressing and data fetching in a Verilog design. When memory enable is active and not in write mode, different outputs are assigned to 'io_data' based on the address 'mem_addr'. For instance, if mem_addr is '8'b1xxxxxxx', 'io_data' gets the value of 'cr_app_data_out'. And If address is '8'b00000010', 'io_data' consists of zero-padded 'SW_I'. Several other memory locations are mapped likewise. If the address doesn't match any of the provided cases, 'io_data' is defaulted to zero."
