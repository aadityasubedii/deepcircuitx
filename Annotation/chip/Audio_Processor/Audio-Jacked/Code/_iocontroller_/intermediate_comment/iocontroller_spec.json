    "spec": "Module name: iocontroller. \n\nModule specification: The 'iocontroller' module is an advanced Verilog RTL (Register-transfer level) design developed to manage a wide range of input-output operational procedures, communicating with a multitude of system hardware components. Its primary responsibilities include directing memory read and write operations, processing signals received from microphones and speakers, controlling LEDs, and handling user-menu interaction commands. \n\nThe module takes a total of fourteen inputs, namely 'clk', 'vga_clk', 'reset', 'mem_addr', 'SW_I', 'mic_done', 'mic_data', 'spkr_update', 'menu_in', 'filter', 'br_memdata_out', 'cr_app_data_out', 'data_out1', as well as a set of control signals ('memwrite', 'mem_en', 'decode_state', and 'io_rd'). Conversely, it delivers a total of nine output results, which include \u2018LEDS\u2019, \u2018mic_start\u2019, \u2018br_memdata_in\u2019, \u2018br_memwrite\u2019, \u2018br_memread\u2019, \u2018spkr_data\u2019, \u2018buffer_updated\u2019, \u2018cr_app_data_in\u2019, 'cr_memwrite', 'cr_memread' and 'io_data'. The input and output ports serve multiple roles including clock synchronization, module resetting, memory address indexing, switch and microphone data intake, memory and speaker data management, menu control, and signaling for application and other I/O units.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes a set of registers and wires that include 'speaker_buffer', 'br', 'present_state', and 'next_state'. 'speaker_buffer' temporarily stores data sent to the speaker, 'br' serves as a control signal for memory space management, while 'present_state' and 'next_state' are utilized within a finite state machine (FSM) to control operational flow.\n\nThe source code is composed of major sections that include input and output port definitions, internal signal definitions, FSM control, memory and I/O unit instruction management based on 'mem_addr', 'memwrite' and 'mem_en' signals, and a system reset operation code block. The logic included in these blocks performs procedures like speaker data buffering, LEDS management, microphone and speakers updates control, memory write/read operations for the bridge memory module and the application memory module, and a FSM to aid in moving from one state to another. This comprehensive module thus plays a central role in managing communication and operations within the system environment.",

                    "text": "Module name: iocontroller. \n\nModule specification: The 'iocontroller' module is an advanced Verilog RTL (Register-transfer level) design developed to manage a wide range of input-output operational procedures, communicating with a multitude of system hardware components. Its primary responsibilities include directing memory read and write operations, processing signals received from microphones and speakers, controlling LEDs, and handling user-menu interaction commands. \n\nThe module takes a total of fourteen inputs, namely 'clk', 'vga_clk', 'reset', 'mem_addr', 'SW_I', 'mic_done', 'mic_data', 'spkr_update', 'menu_in', 'filter', 'br_memdata_out', 'cr_app_data_out', 'data_out1', as well as a set of control signals ('memwrite', 'mem_en', 'decode_state', and 'io_rd'). Conversely, it delivers a total of nine output results, which include \u2018LEDS\u2019, \u2018mic_start\u2019, \u2018br_memdata_in\u2019, \u2018br_memwrite\u2019, \u2018br_memread\u2019, \u2018spkr_data\u2019, \u2018buffer_updated\u2019, \u2018cr_app_data_in\u2019, 'cr_memwrite', 'cr_memread' and 'io_data'. The input and output ports serve multiple roles including clock synchronization, module resetting, memory address indexing, switch and microphone data intake, memory and speaker data management, menu control, and signaling for application and other I/O units.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes a set of registers and wires that include 'speaker_buffer', 'br', 'present_state', and 'next_state'. 'speaker_buffer' temporarily stores data sent to the speaker, 'br' serves as a control signal for memory space management, while 'present_state' and 'next_state' are utilized within a finite state machine (FSM) to control operational flow.\n\nThe source code is composed of major sections that include input and output port definitions, internal signal definitions, FSM control, memory and I/O unit instruction management based on 'mem_addr', 'memwrite' and 'mem_en' signals, and a system reset operation code block. The logic included in these blocks performs procedures like speaker data buffering, LEDS management, microphone and speakers updates control, memory write/read operations for the bridge memory module and the application memory module, and a FSM to aid in moving from one state to another. This comprehensive module thus plays a central role in managing communication and operations within the system environment."
