The tasks it undertakes include managing memory reads and writes, processing signals from microphones and speakers, managing LEDs, and handling menu interactions. It does this by checking for specific conditions (like incoming memory addresses or operation states) and assigns or updates particular output signals accordingly. Some of its operations are linked to a system clock, indicating timed, sequential processing."
