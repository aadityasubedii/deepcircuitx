    "block_comment": "This block assigns a specific RGB data bit to the first index of the data_color_1 array. It does this by indexing into the br_rgb_data_1 array using 30 subtracted by the product of hcount times two as the index. This effectively results in reversing the order of bits and repacking them into data_color_1.\n"
