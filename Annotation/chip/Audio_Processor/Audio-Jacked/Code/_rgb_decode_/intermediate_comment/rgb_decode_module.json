    "module": "Module-level comment: The `rgb_decode` module separates incoming RGB data into discrete Red, Green, and Blue color values. This is achieved through a series of operations synchronized with a clock signal. The module uses two internal buffer registers (`br_rgb_data_0` and `br_rgb_data_1`) to store incoming RGB data. The `get_data` signal controls data fetch, and the `buff_num` selects the buffer for operation. The module further contains two wires (`data_color_0` and `data_color_1`) that extract specific color information based on horizontal pixel count. The `R`, `G`, and `B` outputs are set based on a decoding scheme, distinguishing the color values for each pixel."
