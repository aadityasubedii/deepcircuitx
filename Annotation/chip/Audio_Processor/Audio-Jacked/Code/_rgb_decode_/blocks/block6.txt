This block is a flip-flop implementation that toggles the buffer number (`buff_num`) between two states. It gets activated on any changes in the `vga_addr_bit`. If a `reset` condition arises, it sets `buff_num` to zero. However, in the absence of a `reset`, it flips `buff_num` by taking its bitwise negation using the '`~`' operator. This is typically to manage two alternating systems or buffers in hardware design, like a double buffering system.
