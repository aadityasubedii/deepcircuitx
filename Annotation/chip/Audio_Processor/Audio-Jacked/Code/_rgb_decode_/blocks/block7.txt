This block of code is for synchronous data reset and update functions in a Verilog design. The reset function is accomplished by setting both 'br_rgb_data_0' and 'br_rgb_data_1' to zero when the system reset signal is high. Operationally, if 'decode_state' is high, the 'get_data' signal is set to 1, otherwise, if 'get_data' signal is high, it is reset and the memory output 'br_memdata_out' is fed to 'br_rgb_data_0' or 'br_rgb_data_1' based on the current buffer 'buff_num'. This ensures data is updated from the appropriate memory buffer.
