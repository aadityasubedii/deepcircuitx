    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to manage bit-level operations on two input variables `a` and `b` based on a control flag. The block is activated whenever there is a change in `a`, `b`, or `control`. If the most significant bit of `b` is 1, it negates `b`, adds 1 to it, and sets the NEG flag. Depending on the `control` value, it either performs non-arithmetic (control=0) or arithmetic (control=1) bit shift operations. If the NEG flag is set, it performs a right shift operation, and if not, a left shift operation occurs. If the `control` input doesn't match any of the predefined cases, the value of 'a' is simply passed to 'c'."
