It takes in three inputs - two numbers (a and b) and a control signal. If the control signal is 0, the module performs arithmetic shifting where it shifts `a` to the right by `b2` places when `b` is negative, otherwise it shifts `a` to the left by `b2` places. When the control signal is 1, the module performs logical shifting where it will use zeros to fill up the empty spots regardless of `b` being positive or negative. It also provides capability to handle negative shift amount (`b`). `b` is interpreted as a two's complement number and if it is negative, `b` is inverted and one is added to produce `b2`. The result of shift operation is stored and output in `c`."
