    "module": "Module-level comment: The shift module performs arithmetic and logical shifting of operand `a` by `b` bit-width positions, guided by the control signal. It treats `b` as a two's complement when negative, calculating its absolute value as `b2`. For control=0, arithmetic shifting is performed, shifting `a` right (if `b` is negative) or left. For control=1, logical shifting is done, filling empty places with zeros. The result `c` gets updated after each shift operation."
