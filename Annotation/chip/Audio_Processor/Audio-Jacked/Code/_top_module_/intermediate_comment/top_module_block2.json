    "block_comment": "This block of code implements counter logic with a reset functionality. On the rising edge of the clock signal (CLK_I_BUFG), if the reset signal is high, the counter 'count' and 'initialized' signals are reset to 0. If reset is not asserted, and if the count is less than 20000, 'count' is incremented by 1 on every clock cycle and 'initialized' remains 0. Once the 'count' hits 20000, it stays at 20000, and the 'initialized' signal is set to 1 indicating the end of the count."
