    "block_comment": "This block is a cycle counter and reset manager. Triggered by the positive edge of CLK_I_BUFG, it resets two variables, 'count_bt' and 'state_time', when 'reset' or 'cnt_rst' signals are asserted. If the cycle count is less than 40, 'count_bt' is incremented and 'state_time' is reset. When the count reaches 40, 'count_bt' is capped at 40 and 'state_time' transitions to 1, indicating the end of a counting cycle."
