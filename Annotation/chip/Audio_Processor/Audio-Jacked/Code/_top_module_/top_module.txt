Module-level comment: The 'top_module' serves as the central system in this design, integrating peripherals and memory systems. Functionality ranges from instruction decoding to branching and shifting, using a system clock for synchronization. Input ports manage various user inputs and module control signals, while output ports handle data and control outputs to other modules and devices. Internal signals aid in the coordination of sub-modules and data flow within the system. The broad tasks are handled by a series of sub-modules and procedures such as DAC, VGA operations, IO control, memory selection, and ALU operations. 'Always' blocks govern the system's initiation and timekeeping.
