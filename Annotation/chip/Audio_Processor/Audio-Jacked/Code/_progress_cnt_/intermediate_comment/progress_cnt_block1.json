    "block_comment": "This block resets or increments a counter based on certain conditions. It uses a clock edge-triggered always block to handle the functioning. When the 'menu' input is '01', the counter 'i' is incremented if it is within the range of 0 and 19, and is reset otherwise. If the 'menu' input isn't '01', then 'i' is directly reset to 0. This mechanism allows for cyclic counting within a specific range on a certain condition."
