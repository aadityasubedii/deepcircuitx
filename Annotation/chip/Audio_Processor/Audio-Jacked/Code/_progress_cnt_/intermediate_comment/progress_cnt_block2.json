    "block_comment": "This block of code emits a divided clock signal and resets it based on certain conditions. In every positive edge of the clock if reset is active, all the variables are reset. However, if reset is not active and the binary value of 'menu' equals '01' or '10', a countdown begins from 50000000. Once the count reaches zero, it initially resets to 50000000 and flips the value of 'div_clk'. If none of the aforementioned conditions meet, it simply resets all the variables."
