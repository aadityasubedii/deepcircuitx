    "spec": "Module name: progress_cnt. \n\nModule specification: The progress_cnt module is a Verilog module designed for counting progress based on the input signal 'menu'. This module operates on a system clock 'clk' and a reset signal 'rst'. The 2-bit 'menu' input dictates the operations on the internal counter 'i', effectively acting as a programmable frequency divider or a progress counter. \n\nWhen 'menu' equals 2'b01, the counter 'i' increments by 1 at each positive edge of the internally generated clock 'div_clk', until it reaches a value of 19, post which it resets back to 0. If 'menu' is not equal to 2'b01, 'i' resets to 0. \n\nThe inputs to the module are 'clk', a signal representing the clock of the whole system, 'rst', the reset signal used to initial reset the system, and 'menu', the 2-bit signal which decides the behaviour of the counters. The output from the module is 'i', a 6-bit counter that increments based on the conditions of 'menu' and 'div_clk'. \n\nThe internal signals include a counter 'count' and 'div_clk'. 'count' is a 26-bit counter that decreases from 50,000,000 every clock cycle based on the conditions of 'menu', and toggles the value of 'div_clk' when it reaches 0. 'div_clk' is an internal clock that runs at a frequency divided down from 'clk' using 'count', and is used to control the increment rate of 'i'. \n\nThe module is primarily divided into two blocks. The first block takes in the clock and reset input signals, and based on 'menu', either resets or performs operations on the counter 'count' and 'div_clk'. The second block increments or resets the counter 'i' based on the positive edge of 'div_clk' and 'menu'. \n\nOverall, this module provides a mechanism for a progress counter that can be controlled by the 'menu' input. This combination of counters and dividers allows for a wide range of control over the progress count speed.",

It has an input 'menu' which is a 2-bit wide signal. Based on the value of 'menu', the module either increments a counter named 'i' or resets it. Specifically, when 'menu' is equal to 2'b01, 'i' is incremented by 1 at each positive edge of 'div_clk' (which toggles at every 50,000,000 clock cycles) until it reaches a value of 19. Beyond that, it resets back to 0. If 'menu' is not equal to 2'b01, 'i' resets to 0. The counter 'count' serves to create 'div_clk' by counting the input 'clk' signal and toggles 'div_clk' after every 50,000,000 clock cycles under certain conditions of 'menu' (2'b01 or 2'b10). On reset or any other value of 'menu', both 'count' and 'div_clk' are reset to 0. This module can control the speed of increase of 'i' by dividing down the input clock cycle based on the 'menu' input, and therefore can be used as a programmable frequency divider or a progress counter."

This is used to reset and initialize the internal variables/counters and to put the system to its initial state. \n3. 'menu' is another input to the system.
