Module-level comment: The progress_cnt module operates as a programmable frequency divider/progress counter. It functions based on clock ('clk'), reset ('rst') signals, and a 2-bit input ('menu'). A 6-bit counter 'i' increments at each positive edge of the internally generated down-divided clock signal ('div_clk') up to a maximum value of 19, or resets as per 'menu'. An internal 26-bit counter ('count') helps generate 'div_clk', effectively controls the increment rate of 'i'. This module thereby provides flexible control over speed of progress count.
