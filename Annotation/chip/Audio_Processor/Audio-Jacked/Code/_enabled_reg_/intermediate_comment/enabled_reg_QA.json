Explanation: This is a parameterized module that simulates a register with an enable signal. The width of the register is a generic parameter ('WIDTH'). The module uses an 'always' block which gets triggered at the positive edge of the 'clk' signal. If 'reset' is high, it resets the value of 'b' to 0. When 'reset' is low, if 'enable' is high, the value in 'b' becomes the value of input 'a'. If 'enable' is low, the state of 'b' remains unchanged."
