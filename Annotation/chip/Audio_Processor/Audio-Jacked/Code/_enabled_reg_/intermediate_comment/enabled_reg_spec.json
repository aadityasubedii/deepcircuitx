    "spec": "Module name: enabled_reg. \n\nModule specification: The enabled_reg is a parameterized Verilog module designed to simulate an enabled register with an adjustable width, defined by the parameter 'WIDTH'. Its function executes on an 'always' block which is activated at the positive edge of the 'clk' signal. The module functions in the following way: if 'reset' signal is high, the output 'b' is reset to 0. If 'reset' is low and 'enable' is high, the output 'b' becomes equivalent to the input 'a'. However, if both 'reset' and 'enable' are low or 'enable' is low, the state of 'b' remains unchanged. \n\nInput Ports: The module has four input ports - 'clk', 'reset', 'enable' and 'a'. 'clk' is the clock signal, 'reset' is a signal used to reset the register, 'enable' is a signal used to load the data, and 'a' is the data input.\n\nOutput Ports: The module has one output port named 'b'. It represents the output of the register, which either retains its previous state, gets reset, or takes on the value of 'a', based on the state of 'enable' and 'reset'.\n\nInternal Signals: The module does not employ any internal signals; its operation solely depends on the input and output ports.\n\nCode Block: The main portion of the code consists of an 'always' block, which executes the main functionality of the module guided by the state of 'clk', 'reset' and 'enable'.",
