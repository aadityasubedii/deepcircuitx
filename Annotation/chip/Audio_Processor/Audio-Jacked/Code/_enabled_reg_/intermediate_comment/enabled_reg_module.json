    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, named 'enabled_reg', simulates functionality of a register that can be enabled or disabled. It's a parametric module with width 'WIDTH'. On a positive clock edge, if 'reset' is high, it resets the output 'b' to 0. If 'reset' is low and 'enable' is high, the output 'b' takes the value of input 'a'. If both 'reset' and 'enable' are low, there is no change in the 'b'\\'s state. No internal signals are used; it's driven by input and output ports only."
