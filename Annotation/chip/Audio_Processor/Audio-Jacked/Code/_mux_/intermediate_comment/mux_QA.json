It accepts two inputs 'a' and 'b' and one control signal. The size of the inputs 'a' and 'b' is determined by the parameter REGBITS, which defaults to 4 if no other value is given during its instantiation. The output 'c' is also of size REGBITS. The module routes the input 'b' to the output 'c' when the control signal is true (usually represented as '1'), otherwise it routes the input 'a' to the output. This selection process is accomplished by the always block in the code which is sensitive to any of the input variables (control, a, b). It serves as a combinational logic that facilitates the switching between signals 'a' and 'b'."
