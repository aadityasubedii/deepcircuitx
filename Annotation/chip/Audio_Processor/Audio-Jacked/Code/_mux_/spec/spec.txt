Module name: mux. 

Module specification: The "mux" is a standard multiplexer module in Verilog. Its primary functionality is to serve as a switch, selecting and routing one of the two input data lines 'a' or 'b' to the output line 'c' based on the state of a 'control' signal. The width of the input and output ports are determined by the parameter REGBITS, defaulted to be 4 bits wide. The input ports include 'a' and 'b', representing the two potential source values for the output, and the 'control' signal, a 1-bit input that determines which input line 'a' or 'b' is routed to output. The output port 'c' consistently reflects the value of either input 'a' or 'b', contingent on the given 'control' signal. There are no internal signals utilized within the module. The key section of the code is the always block, which implements a simple control structure to route the appropriate input to the output based on 'control' signal.
