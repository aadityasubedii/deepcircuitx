Module-level comment: This module, named "mux", is a basic multiplexer implemented in Verilog. It selectively routes one of the two inputs 'a' or 'b' to the output 'c' based on the 1-bit 'control' signal. The sizes of inputs and output are defined by the parameter REGBITS defaulting to 4 bits wide. The selection between 'a' and 'b' is performed in an always block, sensitive to any input changes, generating a combinational logic critical for the moduleâ€™s operation.
