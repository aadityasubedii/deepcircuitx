    "block_comment": "This block performs the function of resetting the first 16 entries of the RAM upon receiving a reset signal. It works by continuously monitoring the clock signal, and on every rising edge ('posedge') of the clock, it checks the 'reset' signal. If 'reset' is high, it sets the first 16 entries of the RAM to zero."
