    "spec": "Module name: reg_file.\n\nModule specification: The reg_file is a Verilog module designed to implement Register File for a processor with MIPS architecture. It manages an array of registers denoted by the internal signal 'RAM' and performs read/write operations based on control and timing signals. It contains six inputs and two outputs. The 'clk' input is a system clock that synchronizes the process, 'reset' when actuated, sets the first 16 registers to zero, and the 'regwrite' is a control signal enabling write operations. The last three inputs 'src_addr', 'dst_addr', and 'data_in' specify the source address, destination address, and the data to write to the register file. The two outputs 'data_out1' and 'data_out2' represent the data read from the addresses held by 'src_addr' and 'dst_addr' respectively. Internally, the 'RAM' represents the register file. When 'clk' signal rises, if 'reset' is true, it clears the first 16 registers; if 'regwrite' is true, it writes data at 'dst_addr' location with 'data_in'. The data at 'src_addr' and 'dst_addr' are continuously assigned to 'data_out1' and 'data_out2' respectively.",
