The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU_Controller module is designed with various input and output ports which, are used to manipulate and control the operation of the ALU. This module processes two streams of data in parallel (associations with \"L\" and \"R\" in variables suggests 'Left' and 'Right' data processing). The code implements a state machine at two instances, each working with the different streams of data. The states handle reading input, manipulating data (addition/subtraction), shifting, and outputting the result. The key purpose appears to include performing arithmetic operations (add or subtract based on 'addorsub' status signals) and shifting operations as determined by input signals and internal control variables. The module operates synchronously with respect to a System clock (Sclk) and resets with a negative edge of Frame signal or when the Reset_n signal is low."
