    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block updates the status flags based on the Always-Block Control Flow mechanism. The block reacts on positive edges of system clock (Sclk), executing nested \"if\" and \"case\" operations that depend on ALU status and the flagL value respectively. These operations primarily manipulate variables like L, kL, signbitL, add_statusL, etc with calculation or assignment based operations. The Work flow is broken down into seven flagL cases. Case 1 and 2 handle index and sign comparison operations, setting up index and flags for subsequent tasks. Case 3 and 4 perform addition operations with respect to sign and count values. In case 5 and 6, shifting operations are performed and updated values are stored. By case 7, data is ready for output and passes it finally."
