    "module": "Module-level comment: The ALU_Controller is a control entity for an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), coordinating arithmetic and logical operations. It operates synchronously with a System clock, and resets with a negative edge Frame signal or when Reset_n is low. Implemented with multiple input/output ports and internal signal handling, the module manages data transfer, operation status, and execution flow. A state machine approach steers its functionality, with states for reading input, performing arithmetic operations or shifting, and outputting the result. All intermediates and final computations are efficiently stored and updated in internal registers."
