    "block_comment": "This block is used within a digital signal processing module, managing the control flow of arithmetic operations. It is synced with the system clock's rising edge and checks if the arithmetic-logic-unit (ALU) status equates to 1 to execute instructions. The execution control is maintained by flagR varying its value from 1 to 7. Each value corresponds to carrying out specific operations like read, addition/subtraction, shifting operations, and updating control variables. Multiple conditional statements manage the flow and operations within each state, including boundary checks and setting/updating variable status. Upon reaching flagR = 7, the resultant data is assigned to OutputdataR and status for signal-processing-block is updated to 1."
