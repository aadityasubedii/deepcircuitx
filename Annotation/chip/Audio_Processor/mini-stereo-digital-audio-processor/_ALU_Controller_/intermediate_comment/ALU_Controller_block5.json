    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes system conditions in the event of a reset. Specifically, upon a rising edge of the system clock (Sclk) and when Reset_n equals 0, the many variables within are reset to their initial values to ensure the system starts from a known state. This includes resetting yl, yr, ur, ul, shift_statusL, il, P2S_status, index_rjL, pL, jL, index_coeffL, sign_statusL, shift_statusR, ir, index_rjR, pR, jR, index_coeffR, and sign_statusR to 0. Similarly, flagL and flagR are set to 1, indicating they're active in this reset state. This ensures the system is properly calibrated for subsequent operations."
