Module name: ALU_Controller.

Module specification: 

The ALU_Controller is designed as a controller module for an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and it performs arithmetic and logical operations, effectively overseeing computations conducted by the main data processing ALU. It is designed with various input and output ports which are used to manipulate and control the operation of the ALU. 

The module handles several input ports including "Sclk", "Dclk", "Frame", "Reset_n", "alu_status", "read_rjl", "read_rjr", "read_coeffl", "read_coeffr", "cont_address", "signoutL", "signoutR", "addopL", "addopR", "shiftopL", "shiftopR", and "set". These ports provide signals used for synchronization, status control, data input for the ALU’s operations, and setting various internal values.

The module provides output through ports including "sign_statusL", "sign_statusR", "add_statusL", "add_statusR", "addorsubL", "addorsubR", "shift_statusL", "shift_statusR", "P2S_status", "addip1L", "addip1R", "addip2L", "addip2R", "shiftipL", "shiftipR", "index_rjL", "index_coeffL", "index_inL", "OutputdataL", "index_rjR", "index_coeffR", "index_inR", and "OutputdataR". These ports shows the status of the ALU’s various operations, provides index registers which gets updated during the process, and delivers the main result of the calculations.

The module operates with several internal signals like "il", "ir", "pL", "pR", "jL", "jR", "flagL", "flagR", "L", "R", "ul", "ur", "yl", "yr", "kL", "signbitL", "kR", "signbitR" which all contribute to perform internal arithmetic and logical operations, to control flow of operations, and to store intermediate and final results. 

The ALU_Controller module functions by implementing a state machine approach within its main processing blocks. The states manage the reading of input, carry out the appropriate arithmetic operation (via the "addorsub" signal), perform shifting, and output the result.  All operations are synchronously conducted with respect to a primary system clock signal ("Sclk") and reset with a negative edge of Frame signal or when the "Reset_n" signal is low. As an overarching entity, the ALU_Controller directs the computation and sequencing of operations within an Arithmetic Logic Unit.
