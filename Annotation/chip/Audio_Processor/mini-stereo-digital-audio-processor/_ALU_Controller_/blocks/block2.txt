This block of code is a system reset for a certain component in the case that the irregularity register (ir) reaches 16 upon the fall of the Frame signal. When 'ir' equals 16, the system resets all the parameters to their default values; 'shift_statusR', 'P2S_status', 'sign_statusR' are all reset to 0. Similarly, it resets the indices pointers 'ir', 'index_rjR', 'pR', 'jR', 'index_coeffR' to 0, and it assigns 40-bit zero value to 'yr' and 'ur'. A flagR is set to 1 to signal the completion of reset operation.
