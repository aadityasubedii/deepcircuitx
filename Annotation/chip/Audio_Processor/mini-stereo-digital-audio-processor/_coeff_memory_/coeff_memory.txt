Module-level comment: The 'coeff_memory' module serves as a memory unit for storing and retrieving coefficient data. It uses a 16-bit wide register array 'coeffmem' of size 512 as its memory block. Write operations are performed on a positive clock edge ('Sclk') if 'write_enable' is set, with 'in_data' written to 'coeffmem' at the address defined by 'coeffwrite'. Read operations pull the value from 'coeffmem' at 'coeffread' address to 'data_coeff', if 'read_enable' is high, else 0 is assigned. The module hence effectively manages coefficient data storage and retrieval.
