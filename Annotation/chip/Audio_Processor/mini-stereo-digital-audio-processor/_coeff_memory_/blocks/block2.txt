Comment: 
This block of code is a memory write function using a synchronous clock for a Verilog hardware description. The block keeps track of the write enable signal for memory writing functionality. If the write enable signal is high, the input data is written into the memory location specified by the 'coeffwrite' address index. If the write enable signal is not set, the memory content remains unchanged.
