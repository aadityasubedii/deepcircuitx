    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code is implementing a conditional assignment (ternary operation) for the signal `data_coeff`. It derives its value from the memory block `coeffmem` at an index defined by `coeffread` when a signal `read_enable` is asserted. If `read_enable` signal is not active (low), it assigns a 16-bit zero value to `data_coeff`."
