Module-level comment: The main_module is a top-level module implementing a digital signal processor/control system operation on stereo inputs. It incorporates Serial-to-Parallel conversion (S2P), memory units (RjL/RjR, InL/InR, CoeffL/R) for intermediate storage, and an ALU for arithmetic and logical operations. Data flow within the system is regulated by a set of dedicated control signals. The system starts processing upon the START trigger and operates in sync with the provided system and data-rate clocks. It provides output readiness status and is equipped with an asynchronous Reset.
