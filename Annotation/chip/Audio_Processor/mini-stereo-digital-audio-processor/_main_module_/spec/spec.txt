Module name: main_module. 

Module specification: main_module is a top-level system design module written in Verilog RTL representing a digital signal processing or control system operation. It takes inputs through ports namely Sclk, Dclk, Frame, InputL, InputR, Start, and Reset_n. Sclk and Dclk are the system and data rate clocks respectively. Frame serves as a framing signal while InputL and InputR are the left and right input signals, likely associated with dual-channel data. Start is a trigger to initiate the system operation, and Reset_n is an asynchronous reset input to set the module to its initial state. The module outputs include OutputL, OutputR, OutReady, InReady, which represent the processed left and right output signals, an output readiness status, and an input data readiness indicator respectively. 

The internal signals in the system such as S2P_status, add_statusL, shift_statusL, alu_status, control the status and tasks across various sub-modules like Serial to Parallel converter (S2P), adder, shifter, and ALU. Signals like address_rj, address_coeff, address_in are address lines used for memory access while signals like S2P_L, S2P_R, inputdataL, inputdataR transport data between different modules. 

The system comprises interconnected sub-modules which include Controller, serial-to-parallel converter (S2P), multiple memory units (RjL/RjR-mem, CoeffL/R-mem, InL/R-mem), an ALU controller, and left and right signal circuitry modules for sign extension, adder, and shifter. Controller module manages operations like memory access, sleep status. S2P performs data stream conversion, readying it for further processing. Memory units store temporary data during the processing. The ALU sub-module controls different operations including sign extension for handling data, addition or subtraction of data, and bit shifting. The entire system is controlled and synchronized based on the clock signals and the start trigger.
