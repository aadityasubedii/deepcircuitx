    "module": "Module-level comment: The P2S module is a Parallel-to-Serial converter which executes the conversion process by indexing bit positions of 40-bit input data (OutputdataL, OutputdataR) using an internal signal 'col'. Conversion is triggered on the rising edge of Frame signal when 'P2S_status' is high, with bits serially outputted on the rising edge of Sclk. Progress of the output is monitored via 'col_out', while readiness for new inputs is indicated by 'OutReady'. The module automatically resets after each full data conversion."
