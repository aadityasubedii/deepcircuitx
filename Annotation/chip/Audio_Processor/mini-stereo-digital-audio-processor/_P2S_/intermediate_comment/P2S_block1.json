    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code manages the output of data based on certain conditions. Whenever there is a positive edge clock signal, it checks if the 'col' value is equal to -1; if true, it sets the 'col_out' to current 'col' value, resets 'OutReady' to 0, and assigns 'col' as 39. When 'col' falls within the defined constraints (<=38 && >-1), it assigns the 'OutputdataL' and 'OutputdataR' index 'col' to 'OutputL' and 'OutputR' respectively, decrements value of 'col' by 1 and assigns 'col_out' to 'col'. If 'col' becomes -1, it sets 'col_out' as -1. These steps operate within a clock cycle to ensure synchronization."
