    "spec": "Module name: P2S. Module specification: The P2S module is a Parallel to Serial converter that processes 40-bit input data for the left and right channels (OutputdataL and OutputdataR). It works by sequentially outputting the data from the 39th bit to the 0th bit on the rising edge of frame signal and clock signal (Sclk). On completion of this process, it resets itself and indicates readiness for new input data through the 'OutReady' output. Key inputs include 'OutputdataL', 'OutputdataR', control signal 'P2S_status', 'Sclk' and 'Frame'. Primary outputs are 'OutputL' and 'OutputR' for serial data output, 'OutReady' to indicate operation completion and 'col_out' to monitor the progression of the output. The internal signal 'col' is used for indexing bit positions in the input data and serves as an indicator for the conversion status. The code is split into two blocks: the first triggers on the rising edge of Frame signal and initiates the conversion process if inputs meet certain conditions, the second triggers on the clock (Sclk) edge and takes care of the entire bit output process, resetting conditions, and output readiness signals.",

Each bit from this 40-bit line is output serially on 'OutputR' under certain conditions.\n3. P2S_status: A single bit input port.
