    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code primarily functions as a reset logic generator. Specifically, it checks whether two variables, 'ib' and 'jb', equal certain constant values and, upon matching these values (9456 and 5 or 13056 and 9), it performs a reset operation. The reset process is implemented by consecutively assigning the 'Reset_n' signal to '0' and then to '1' after a delay of 13020 time units, imitating a reset signal's waveform."
