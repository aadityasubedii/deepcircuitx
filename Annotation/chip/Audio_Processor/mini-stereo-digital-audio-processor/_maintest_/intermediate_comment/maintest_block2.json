    "block_comment": "The block manages flow and organization of input data in a certain frame structure during a positive edge clock cycle, under specific conditions. If reset is not activated and an input ready flag is up, the block fetches data from a 2D input data array into InputL and InputR, performs countdown for jb (a sub-frame identifier) and completes a frame when jb reaches either end. To create a new frame, input data is fetched incrementally by shifting two steps along ib (a frame identifier). This iterative process continues until total frames reach 15056. The frame structure design enhances data handling efficiency."
