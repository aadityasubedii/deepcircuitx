    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes system variables and fills the input_data array from an external file. Initially, it sets the Dclk and Sclk to low and Reset_n to high while setting the Start signal. It then reads hexadecimal data from a file named \"midin.in\" into an input_data array and prepares to write the output data into a file \"data_out.out\". After a delay of 1302 time units, it turns off the Start signal, sets the Frame to zero, and initializes ib to 0, jb to 15, k to -1, and l to 40."
