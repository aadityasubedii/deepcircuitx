It contains two clocks, 'Sclk' and 'Dclk', and several control signals including 'Start' and 'Reset_n' along with input and output data signals. It reads data from a module 'input_data' that was read from an external file \"midin.in\" and processes it. The processed data are then passed to the 'main_module' for further operation and the output is then written into an output file 'data_out.out'. The simulation is controlled by manipulating the 'Reset_n' signal at specific time intervals. The operation of the module is mainly driven based on the rising edges of the two clocks 'Sclk' and 'Dclk'."
