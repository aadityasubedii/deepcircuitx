    "spec": "Module name: maintest. \n\nModule specification: The 'maintest' module is a testbench used to simulate and verify the operations of another unit known as the 'main_module'. In terms of input, it receives two clock signals, 'Sclk' and 'Dclk', a framing signal 'Frame', two data input signals 'InputL' and 'InputR', along with control signals 'Start' and 'Reset_n'. The module's output includes two processed data signals 'OutputL' and 'OutputR' and two readiness signals 'OutReady' and 'InReady' which indicate when the module is ready to output data or accept new input, respectively. \n\nInternally, this module uses several variables including loop counters 'ib', 'jb', 'k', 'l', input data arrays 'input_data', output data arrays 'data_outl' and 'data_outr', and a handle 'data_out' for writing data to an output file. The module's operation is controlled by the 'Start' and 'Reset_n' signals, and driven by the clock signals 'Sclk' and 'Dclk'. \n\nThe main blocks of the module include: an initialization section for setting up data input and handling; a block responding to the 'Dclk' signal edge for controlling input data processing including data framing and incrementing indices; a block responding to the 'Sclk' signal edge for handling output data processing and writing to a file; and conditionally-controlled blocks for special reset sequence handling. All operations are mainly based on the rising edges of the two clocks 'Sclk' and 'Dclk'.",
