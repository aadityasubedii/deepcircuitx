    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed for data storage and output, specifically for left and right audio channels (OutputL and OutputR). It operates on a positive edge of Sclk (system clock), likely representing sample ticks in an audio-streaming context. When the 'OutReady' flag is high, the block treats the current sample as valid and operates on it. It maintains two-dimensional arrays, data_outl and data_outr, for storing samples. If the 'l' counter value reaches zero, the samples are written to an output file and the 'l' counter resets to 40. When 'k' index value reaches 7000, indicating the end of the streaming session, the data file is closed. This code also increments 'k' index by one when the 'Frame' control flag goes high during the last sample of each frame."
