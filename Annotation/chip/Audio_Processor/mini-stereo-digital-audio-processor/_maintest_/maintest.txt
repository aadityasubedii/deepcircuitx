Module-level comment: The 'maintest' module serves as a testbench for the 'main_module', simulating and verifying its operations. Utilizing two clocks 'Sclk' and 'Dclk' for timing, the module processes input data ('InputL' and 'InputR'), controlled by 'Start' and 'Reset_n' signals. Additional control is established by 'Frame' for data framing. Output data ('OutputL', 'OutputR') is generated and readiness signals ('OutReady', 'InReady') are managed. Internally, it applies input/output data arrays and specific methods for data handling under 'Sclk' and 'Dclk'. It also includes a specialized reset sequence for specific conditions.
