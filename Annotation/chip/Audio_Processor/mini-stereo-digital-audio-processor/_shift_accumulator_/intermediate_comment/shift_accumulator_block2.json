    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a 40-bit shift register with load and clear functionalities. On a falling edge of 'sclk', if 'clear' is asserted, the shift register is reset to all zeros. If 'load' is high and 'shift_en' is also high, the block performs a right shift by one bit on 'in_bk' and stores it to 'shift_reg'. If 'load' is high and 'shift_en' is low, 'in_bk' is directly loaded into 'shift_reg'. If none of the conditions are met, the existing value in 'shift_reg' is retained."
