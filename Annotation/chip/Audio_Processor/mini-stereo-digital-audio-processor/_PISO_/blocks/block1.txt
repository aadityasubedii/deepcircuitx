This code block is a serial output encoder implementing parallel to serial data conversion. It operates on a system clock edge. For a high level 'Clear', it resets all variables to their initial settings. The block also takes a 'p2s_en' (Parallel to Serial Enable) as control input. If 'p2s_en' is high, the parallel data 'Shift_done' is loaded into register 'register_piso'. During a frame, determined by 'Frame' and 'ready_out', the data bits in 'register_piso' are shifted serially out, and the output readiness changes. If the frame flag is '1', 'SerialOut' will continue outputting the content. If 'count_bit' reaches zero, the frame flag will be reset. For all other cases, the block resets 'count_bit', 'SerialOut', and 'OutReady'.
