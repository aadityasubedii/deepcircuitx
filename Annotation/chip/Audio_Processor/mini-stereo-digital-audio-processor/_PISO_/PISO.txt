Module-level comment: The PISO (Parallel-In-Serial-Out) module performs data shifting from parallel to serial mode. On a high p2s_en signal, the 40-bit parallel data from Shift_done is loaded onto the register_piso. The shift process begins when Frame signal is high and continues until all bits are shifted, tracked by count_bit. In parallel, the OutReady signal indicates readiness. If the Clear signal is high, all registers are reset. The module works on the positive edge of the system clock (Sclk).
