    "spec": "Module name: PISO.\nModule specification: \n\nThe PISO (Parallel-In-Serial-Out) is a Verilog module designed to perform shifting of data inputted in a parallel format and output it in a serial format. It operates on the positive edge of the system clock (Sclk). The module also includes a reset functionality, triggered when the Clear signal is high.\n\nPISO has five input ports: Sclk, Clear, p2s_en, Frame, and a 40-bit wide Shift_done where parallel data is loaded. The Sclk is the system clock input used for synchronization. The Clear signal is used to reset the system to its default configuration. The p2s_en signal enables the shifting from the parallel to the serial mode. The Frame signal indicates that data is ready for shifting. \n\nThe module provides two outputs: SerialOut and OutReady. SerialOut is a register type output that provides the serial output from the parallel input data that is loaded. The OutReady is an indicator that the process is ready to shift from parallel to serial configuration.\n\nInternally, PISO utilizes a variety of signals, including a 6-bit wide count_bit used to count the shifted bits, a 40-bit wide internal register (register_piso) where parallel data is loaded, a ready_out signal indicating readiness for data shift, and a frame_flag used as a status indicator for the frame shift process.\n\nThe code is sectioned into various blocks. The initial segment initializes system variables in case of a system reset. The follow-up block, activated when the p2s_en signal is high, loads the inputted parallel data onto the internal register, and begins preparation for shifting. Another block handles the initial shift under the Frame signal, then continuous shifting is handled by the next block. The last block resets variables if data is not ready for shifting. This design ensures efficient transformation of data from parallel to serial format.",

Explanation: The PISO (Parallel-In-Serial-Out) module is a type of shift register where the data is loaded in parallel format and collected in a serial format. Initially when the Clear signal is high, the variables and output are reset. If the parallel to serial enable (p2s_en) is high, the function is ready to shift the data from parallel into register_piso and ready_out is enabled. When the Frame signal is high and data is ready for shifting, it starts to shift and reduce the bit count one by one from the shifting data. The SerialOut gives out the bit-wise serial output. When the bit counter reaches zero, it turns off the frame_flag. If the Frame signal is not high after this or if the data is not ready for shifting, it resets the variables and output."

When this input is high, shifting from parallel to serial data is enabled. \n- Frame: This signal when high, indicates data is ready to be shifted from parallel to serial.\n- Shift_done: It's a 40-bit wide input where data is loaded in parallel way.\n\nOutput ports: [SerialOut, OutReady]. \nExplanation: \n- SerialOut: This reg type output gives bit by bit output serially from the parallel input data that is loaded.\n- OutReady: It's a reg type output which indicates that the process is ready to shift from parallel to serial when it's high.

It's reset to 40 (6'd40) initially and decreased by 1 (1'b1) every time a bit is shifted out. It resets again once the value of count_bit reaches zero after all bits have been shifted out.\n  \n- register_piso: This is a 40-bit wide internal register signal where the parallel data from Shift_done is loaded initially when the parallel to serial enable (p2s_en) is high. The serial output is achieved from this register, one bit at a time as specified by the current value of the count_bit.\n\n- ready_out: This signal is used as an indication of readiness for data shift. It's initially set to low and set to high when the p2s_en signal is high indicating data is ready to be shifted from register_piso to SerialOut. It's set to low just after the data starts to shift out.\n\n- frame_flag: This is used as a flag to indicate the status of the frame for shifting. When the shifting process begins, it sets the flag high and stays high until the shifting process ends, i.e., until the count_bit is 0. It is used to conditionally execute the logic inside the module."
