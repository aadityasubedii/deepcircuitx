    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a synchronous process tied to the negative edge of the Dclk signal or an active low reset. The primary function of the block is to serially capture and store Left and Right input data when a Frame signal is detected, and then to prepare the data for parallel output. Initially, on receiving a Frame signal, the 'col' variable is set to 15. By checking if 'col' is above zero, this loop captures the InputL and InputR data and stores it in an indexed manner with decrementing address into 'S2Pdata_L' and 'S2Pdata_R' respectively. Once 'col' reaches 31, indicating that all 16 pieces of data have been captured, it activates the 'S2P_status' signal, and sets the entire 'S2Pdata_L' and 'S2Pdata_R' arrays ready for parallel output to 'S2P_L' and 'S2P_R' respectively."
