    "spec": "Module name: S2P. \n\nModule specification: The S2P module is a serial to parallel converter that functions synchronously with a data clock signal. Its operation is mainly divided into two stages: data storage and data output. The module makes use of five input ports, namely Dclk (the data clock signal making it synchronous), Frame (a control signal triggering the conversion process), InputL and InputR (the actual serial data inputs to be converted), and Reset_n (a reset signal). The output ports are S2P_status (a status flag indicating whether the conversion process is finished), and S2P_L and S2P_R (the parallel outputs). The module also employs a 5-bit col register as an index to the positions in two 16-bit wide registers, S2Pdata_L and S2Pdata_R, that individually store the left and right channel inputs. The conversion process commences when Frame is high (1'b1), causing the index col to be set to 15 and the incoming serial data to be stored accordingly in S2Pdata_L and S2Pdata_R with each negative transition of Dclk. When the col index reaches 31, it indicates that all the serial data has been successfully converted to parallel format and hence, S2P_status is set to 1. The parallel data is then assigned from S2Pdata_L and S2Pdata_R to S2P_L and S2P_R respectively.",
