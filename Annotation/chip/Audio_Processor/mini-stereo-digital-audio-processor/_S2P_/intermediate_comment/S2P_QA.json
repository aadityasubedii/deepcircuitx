On each 'negedge' of the Dclk (which seems to be the data clock), with frame set to 1'b1, it sets column index (col) to 15 and then loads serial input data (InputL and InputR) into left and right register arrays (S2Pdata_L and S2Pdata_R) until col becomes -1. When the index col equals to 31, it assigns the parallel data collected in S2Pdata_L and S2Pdata_R to S2P_L and S2P_R respectively and sets S2P_status to 1, signifying a successful conversion of serial data to parallel. The S2P_status functions as the status flag and the Reset_n is to reset the process. The conversion process seems to be synchronized with the input frame signal."
