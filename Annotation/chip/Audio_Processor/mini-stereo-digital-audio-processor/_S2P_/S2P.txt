Module-level comment: The S2P module acts as a serial to parallel converter. The data conversion process is initiated with a high'Frame' signal, following which it makes use of the data clock signal (Dclk) to store incoming serial data from InputL and InputR into internal storage registers based on the index from 'col'. This operation continues until 'col' reaches 31, signalling that the conversion is complete, indicated by the 'S2P_status' flag setting to high. The processed parallel data is then projected through S2P_L and S2P_R output ports.
