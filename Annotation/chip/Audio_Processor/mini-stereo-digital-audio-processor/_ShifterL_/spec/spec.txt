Module name: ShifterL. 
Module specification: The 'ShifterL' is a Verilog module that is designed to execute a logical shift right operation. This operation is controlled by two input ports. The first input port is 'shift_statusL', a single bit which serves	as a control signal. When 'shift_statusL' is set to 1, the module performs the shift operation on the second input port 'shiftipL', or otherwise, assigns 0 to the output. 'shiftipL' is the value, 40-bit wide, which is logically shifted to the right upon the activation of 'shift_statusL'. The resultant output from this operation or the null value (in case 'shift_statusL' is not 1) is assigned to the output port 'shiftopL', which is a 40-bit wide signal. The module does not employ any internal signals. The module logic is contained within an 'always' block that is triggered on any change to 'shift_statusL' or 'shiftipL'. This block contains a conditional if statement that performs the shift operation when 'shift_statusL' equals 1, or stores a 0 in the output otherwise.
