Module-level comment: The 'ShifterL' module performs a logical right shift operation on a 40-bit wide input 'shiftipL' based on the control signal 'shift_statusL'. When 'shift_statusL' is 1, 'shiftipL' value is right-shifted and outputted via 'shiftopL', or 0 is issued otherwise. The shift operation or value assignment is executed in an 'always' block that responds to any changes to 'shift_statusL' or 'shiftipL'.
