    "block_comment": "This block of code is a shift operation on a given input. It checks the `shift_statusL` control signal, and if it's '1', it performs a right shift operation on the signed input `shiftipL`. Otherwise, it sets `shiftopL` to 0. The block operates as an arithmetic right shift unit, simulating shift register behavior. It's triggered by either change in `shift_statusL` or `shiftipL`, hence functioning as a synchronous design component."
