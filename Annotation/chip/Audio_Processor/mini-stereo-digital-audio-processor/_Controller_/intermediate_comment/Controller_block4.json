    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes certain variables in Verilog RTL design. At the start, the variable 'state' is set to 1, 'cont_address' is set to value -1, and 'set' is initialized to 0. The function of this block is to provide initial values to these variables at the beginning of the simulation. It achieves this by utilizing an 'initial' block that executes once at time zero of the simulation."
