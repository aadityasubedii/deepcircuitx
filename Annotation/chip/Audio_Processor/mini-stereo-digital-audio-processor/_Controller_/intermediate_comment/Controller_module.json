    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'Controller' module is a state machine managing various processes in a system. It uses input signals like 'Sclk', 'Dclk', 'Frame', 'S2P_status', 'sleep_status', 'Reset_n', and 'col' to control flow of data and execution of instructions. Output signals include status flags, address signals and control signals. The module uses 4-bit 'state' for internal state tracking. It uses three always blocks, triggered by 'Frame' or 'Sclk', implementing control based on state transitions, enabling system synchronization and managing the data flow."
