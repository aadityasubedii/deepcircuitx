    "spec": "Module name: Controller.\n\nModule specification: \n\nThe `Controller` module is a state machine that manages a variety of processes within a hardware system, such as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) or a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). This module orchestrates the flow of data and execution of instructions, managing diverse aspects like rj_status, coeff_status, in_status, which can be viewed as status flags for different procedures.\n\nThe 'Controller' module has multiple input ports which include Sclk, Dclk portraying system and data clocks respectively, 'Frame', 'S2P_status', 'sleep_status' as control signals that dictate the current mode of operation, 'Reset_n' as the reset signal, and 'col' interpreted as a 32-bit input data. In contrast, the output ports include 'InReady', 'rj_status', 'coeff_status', 'in_status', 'alu_status' serving as hardware statuses, 'address_rj', 'address_coeff', 'address_in' as address signals, 'cont_address', 'set' as control signals, 'clear' as reset signal, and 'Start' indicating the beginning of a process.\n\nWithin the `Controller` module, the 4-bit 'state' signal represents the current state of the operation which is then used in the state machine to switch between different operational modes. An integer 'i' that is currently unused, is also declared.\n\nThis Verilog code primarily consists of three always blocks which are executed based on 'Frame', the positive edge of 'Sclk', and 'Sclk' respectively. The first always block controls the state transitions of the Controller module on 'Frame'. The second always block with 'Sclk' as the triggering signal uses a case statement driven by 'state' and 'Frame' to effect changes to address and status signals. The third always block ensures the system is in reset state when 'Reset_n' is active.\n\nOverall, Controller module prioritizes system synchronization, data flow, and process management, thereby constituting an integral part of the larger system it is a part of.",

These states manage different aspects such as rj_status, coeff_status, in_status which can be considered as status flags for different processes. These flags are set or reset based on the 'Frame' and 'S2P_status' input signals. The transition between states depends on conditions such as value of 'Frame', 'S2P_status', 'Reset_n', and 'col' etc. The module also manages addressing systems associated with these processes, incrementing address values as certain conditions are met. Some hardware controls like 'InReady' and 'Start' are also managed within this state machine.

This module orchestrates the flow of data and execution of instructions, managing diverse aspects like rj_status, coeff_status, in_status, which can be viewed as status flags for different procedures.\n\nThe 'Controller' module has multiple input ports which include Sclk, Dclk portraying system and data clocks respectively, 'Frame', 'S2P_status', 'sleep_status' as control signals that dictate the current mode of operation, 'Reset_n' as the reset signal, and 'col' interpreted as a 32-bit input data. In contrast, the output ports include 'InReady', 'rj_status', 'coeff_status', 'in_status', 'alu_status' serving as hardware statuses, 'address_rj', 'address_coeff', 'address_in' as address signals, 'cont_address', 'set' as control signals, 'clear' as reset signal, and 'Start' indicating the beginning of a process.\n\nWithin the `Controller` module, the 4-bit 'state' signal represents the current state of the operation which is then used in the state machine to switch between different operational modes. An integer 'i' that is currently unused, is also declared.\n\nThis Verilog code primarily consists of three always blocks which are executed based on 'Frame', the positive edge of 'Sclk', and 'Sclk' respectively. The first always block controls the state transitions of the Controller module on 'Frame'. The second always block with 'Sclk' as the triggering signal uses a case statement driven by 'state' and 'Frame' to effect changes to address and status signals. The third always block ensures the system is in reset state when 'Reset_n' is active.\n\nOverall, Controller module prioritizes system synchronization, data flow, and process management, thereby constituting an integral part of the larger system it is a part of."
