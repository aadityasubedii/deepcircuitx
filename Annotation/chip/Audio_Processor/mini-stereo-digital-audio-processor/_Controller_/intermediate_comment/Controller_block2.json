    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a state machine controlling the flow of data in a hardware module. It executes on the positive edge of system clock 'Sclk'. When 'Start' signal is high, it resets the 'state' to 0. Then it enters a case statement, up to eight states (0-1, 3, 5-8) can be reached. It changes 'InReady', 'rj_status', 'coeff_status', 'in_status' and 'clear' signals in state 0. In states 1, 3, 5, it sets 'InReady' high and checks 'Frame' signal to change 'address_rj', 'address_coeff', 'address_in' and 'state'. In state 6, both 'Reset_n' and 'sleep_status' signals are checked to make changes in 'state', 'InReady' and 'alu_status'. In state 7, 'Reset_n' signal is used to keep 'state' in 7 or switch to state 5. In state 8, based on 'Reset_n', 'S2P_status', 'sleep_status' signals, 'state', 'InReady', 'in_status' and 'alu_status' are adjusted."
