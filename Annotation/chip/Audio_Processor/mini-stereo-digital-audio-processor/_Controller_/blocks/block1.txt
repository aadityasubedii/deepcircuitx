This block of code is a state initialization block. It specifies that when the system clock (Sclk) ticks, this block is given priority. If the reset (Reset_n) is active (low), it initializes variables InReady and alu_status to 0, enforces a state of 7. This means the block prepares the system to a known initial state when a reset is signaled.
