It accepts two 40-bit inputs 'addip1L' and 'addip2L', and a single bit input 'addorsubL'. If 'addorsubL' is 1, the module performs subtraction operation, 'addip1L' subtract 'addip2L', otherwise it performs addition operation, 'addip1L' add 'addip2L'. The result is placed in the 40-bit output 'addopL'."

It chooses between the addition and the subtraction of the two other inputs - addip1L and addip2L.

If addorsubL is '1', then addopL contains the result of addip1L - addip2L, and if addorsubL is '0', addopL contains the result of addip1L + addip2L."
