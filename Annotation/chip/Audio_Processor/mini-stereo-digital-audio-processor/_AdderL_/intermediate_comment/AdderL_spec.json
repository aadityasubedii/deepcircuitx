    "spec": "Module name: AdderL. \n\nModule specification: The AdderL is a configurable 40-bit adder and subtracter. It has a simple functionality of performing either addition or subtraction operation of its two 40-bit inputs based on a single bit input. The input ports include 'addip1L' and 'addip2L', which are the 40-bit numbers on which either addition or subtraction operations are performed. Additionally, input 'addorsubL' determines whether to perform addition (when it's '0') or subtraction (when it's '1'). Another input, 'add_statusL', is declared but not used in any operations within the module. The output port is a 40-bit 'addopL', which holds the result of either addition of 'addip1L' and 'addip2L' if 'addorsubL' is '0' or subtraction if 'addorsubL' is '1'. There are no internal signals within the module. The main block of the code implements the decision mechanism based on the 'addorsubL' input to perform either the addition or subtraction operation. The module uses a simple if-else structure within the 'always' block to hold its core functionality of being an adder or subtracter.",
