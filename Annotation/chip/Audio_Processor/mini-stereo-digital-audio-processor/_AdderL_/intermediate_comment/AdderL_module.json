    "module": "Module-level comment: The AdderL module is a configurable 40-bit adder/subtracter. It performs addition or subtraction on 'addip1L' and 'addip2L' based on the 'addorsubL' input (1 for subtraction, 0 for addition) and outputs the result on 'addopL'. The main functionality is achieved via an 'always' block that leverages an if-else condition to decide between addition and subtraction. Note that 'add_statusL' input is declared but not used."
