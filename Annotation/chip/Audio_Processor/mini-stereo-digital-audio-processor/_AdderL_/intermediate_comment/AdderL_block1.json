    "block_comment": "The block of code handles arithmetic operations of addition and subtraction. It relies on the value of the control signal `addorsubL` to determine the type of operation: if `addorsubL` equals '1', the block performs subtraction (`addip1L-addip2L`) and assigns the result to the `addopL`; otherwise, it performs the addition operation (`addip1L+addip2L`) and assigns the result to `addopL`."
