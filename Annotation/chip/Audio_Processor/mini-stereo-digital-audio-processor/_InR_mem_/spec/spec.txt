Module name: InR_mem. 

Module specification: The InR_mem is a module designed to handle memory-related operations. It uses an internal 16-bit wide memory array 'inr' with 512 locations to store and retrieve data, and a loop index 'r' for memory reset/clear operations. The input ports comprise of system clock 'Sclk', status signal 'in_status', active-low reset signal 'Reset_n', active-high clear signal 'clear', memory address 'row', input data 'Input', and 'index_inR' which is used to select the output data. On the other hand, 'inputdataR' is the output port that represents the module output. 

In operation, the module writes 'Input' to the 'inr' memory array at the 'row' index when a positive edge is detected in 'in_status' and if 'row' is less than 512. If 'Reset_n' goes low or 'clear' goes high, every location in the memory is reset by using a loop that iterates over 0 to 511 using index 'r'. The data present in the 'inr' memory array at the 'index_inR' location is assigned as the output 'inputdataR'.
