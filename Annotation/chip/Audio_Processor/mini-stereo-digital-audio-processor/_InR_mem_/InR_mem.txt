Module-level comment: The InR_mem module is a memory handler that uses an internal 16-bit wide memory 'inr' with 512 locations. It writes 'Input' to 'inr' at 'row' index on a positive edge of 'in_status' if 'row' is less than 512. Upon 'Reset_n' low or 'clear' high, it uses an internal loop index 'r' to reset all locations in 'inr' to zero. The module's output 'inputdataR' is the data present in 'inr' at 'index_inR'.
