    "block_comment": "The block of code manages storage resets and updating an array. It first checks if a reset signal (Reset_n) is active or if a clear operation is requested. If so, it initializes a 512-element array (inr) to all zeroes. Furthermore, when the row index is less than 512, it updates the current row of the array with the input value. The block synchronizes these operations with positive edges of the 'in_status' signal. Hence, the functionality encapsulates reset, clear, and input handling for an array data structure in a synchronous manner."
