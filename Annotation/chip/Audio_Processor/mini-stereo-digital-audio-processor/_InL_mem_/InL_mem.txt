Module-level comment: The InL_mem module acts as a resettable, uniquely addressable memory unit for 16-bit data. Based on input signals, it clears memory (when Reset_n is low or clear is high), stores data at the 'row' index upon a positive edge of 'in_status', and outputs data from the 'index_inL' location. It uses a 2D 'inl' register array (16x512) for data storage and a 'r' register for iterating over 'inl' during a reset.
