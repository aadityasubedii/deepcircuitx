Module name: InL_mem. 

Module specification: The InL_mem module is essentially a uniquely addressable and resettable storage unit for 16-bit input data. The module takes seven input ports including Sclk (the system clock that does not participate in the operations within the module), in_status (a status signal clocking each operation inside the module), Reset_n (an active low reset signal that when low or clear is high, clears the memory content), clear (an active high clear signal that when high or Reset_n is low, clears the memory content), row (as an index of where the input data will be stored in memory), Input (as the 16-bit data input that will be committed to memory at the address determined by row), and index_inL (as the index from which output data is read). The module produces one output port: inputdataL, this 16-bit output data comes from the memory location specified by index_inL. Inside the module, there are two internal signals: 'inl', a 2D register array of size 16x512 that stores the input data, and 'r', a 10-bit register used to clear the content of the 'inl' memory when Reset_n or clear signal is triggered. The operation of the module can be segmented into two primary blocks: the first block responds to the positive edge of the 'in_status' signal, in which data is stored into memory if the row value is less than 512, and if Reset_n is 0 or clear is 1, the inl register is cleared; the second block is an assign statement that simply assigns the value at inl[index_inL] to inputdataL. The InL_mem module manages the execution of these operations with a careful and effective memory management scheme.
