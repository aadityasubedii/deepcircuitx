It operates based on some control signals: Sclk, in_status, Reset_n, and clear. The data is always stored into memory at the positive edge of 'in_status' signal. If Reset_n is low or clear signal is high, it clears the memory (sets to '0') for 512 rows. The output of the module (inputdataL) is the value at the memory address specified by index_inL signal. This module essentially acts like a resettable and addressable storage for input data."
