Module name: rj_memory.

Module specification: The rj_memory is a simple synchronous memory module that uses a 16-bit wide memory array of size 16 for storage. The primary functionality of this module is to perform read and write operations based on input control signals. It operates synchronously with the Sclk (system clock). There are six input ports: write_enable, read_enable, Sclk, in_data, rjwrite, and rjread. 'Write_enable' and 'read_enable' are control signals for write and read operations respectively. 'Sclk' is the system clock signal which governs the synchronization. 'In_data' is a 16-bit input data for write operation, rjwrite indicates memory writing address and rjread specifies reading address. The module has one output port: data_rj. 'Data_rj' is the 16-bit output, it outputs the data read from the memory when 'read_enable' is high or 0 otherwise.

Internally, the module uses 'rjmem', a 16-bit wide memory array, for data storage. The always block in the code is used to perform the write operation in synchronization with the positive edge of 'Sclk'. If 'write_enable' is set, it writes 'in_data' into 'rjmem' at the 'rjwrite' address. If 'write_enable' is not set, it leaves the memory as it is. The assign block is used to manage the output 'data_rj'. This output is dependent on 'read_enable'. If 'read_enable' is set, 'data_rj' outputs the value from 'rjmem' accessed at 'rjread' address. If 'read_enable' is not set, 'data_rj' outputs 0. The module essentially forms a basic, synchronous read-write memory system.
