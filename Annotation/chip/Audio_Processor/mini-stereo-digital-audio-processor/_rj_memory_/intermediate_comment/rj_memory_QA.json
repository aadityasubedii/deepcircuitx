It takes input flags for write and read operations, input data to be written, and addresses for the write and read operations. When the write_enable signal is high, the data from in_data is written to the memory location addressed by rjwrite. Otherwise, the original data remains unchanged. The module outputs data from the memory location addressed by rjread when the read_enable signal is high. Otherwise, it will output 0.

If it is high, then data is written from in_data to the memory address specified by rjwrite.\n- read_enable: This is a control signal that triggers a read operation on the rj_memory module. If it is high, then data is read from the memory address specified by rjread and made available at the output port data_rj.\n- Sclk: This is the system clock signal which synchronizes all the operations in the rj_memory module. The write operation is triggered on the positive edge of this clock signal.\n- in_data: This is a 16-bit input data signal that provides the data to be stored in the memory.\n- rjwrite: This is a 4-bit address signal that points to the memory address where the input data should be written.\n- rjread: This is a 4-bit address signal that points to the memory address from where data needs to be read.\n\nOutput ports: [data_rj]. \nExplanation: \n- data_rj: This is a 16-bit output data port.
