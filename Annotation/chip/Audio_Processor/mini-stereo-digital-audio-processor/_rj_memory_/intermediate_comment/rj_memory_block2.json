    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to update or maintain a memory location within the 'rjmem' array depending on a write-enable signal. The block implements this functionality by always triggering at the positive edge of the signal 'Sclk'. If the 'write_enable' signal is high (1'b1), then 'rjmem' at the 'rjwrite' index is updated with 'in_data'. If 'write_enable' is not high (else), the 'rjmem' value remains the same."
