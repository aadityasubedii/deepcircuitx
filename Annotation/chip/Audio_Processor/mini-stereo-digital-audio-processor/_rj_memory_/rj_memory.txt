Module-level comment: The 'rj_memory' module functions as a 16-bit synchronous memory with 16 locations. It performs read/write operations driven by the 'write_enable'/'read_enable' control signals and 'rjwrite'/'rjread' addresses, synchronized with the system clock 'Sclk'. The 'in_data' is written to the 'rjmem' array at 'rjwrite' address on write enable. If 'read_enable' is active, 'data_rj' outputs data from 'rjmem' at 'rjread' address, else it remains 0.
