    "spec": "Module name: Zero_detector\n\nModule specification: The 'Zero_detector' module is a hardware module designed to manage the sleep mode of a system based on the input signals namely 'InputL' and 'InputR'. It operates by continuously monitoring these two 16-bit input signals for zero levels. The input signals are triggered at the positive edge of the 'in_status' control signal. The functionality of the module is controlled by a reset line 'Reset_n', which when goes low, resets the internal signals 'sleep_count' and 'sleep_status' to zero. \n\nThe main functionality of this module revolves around the aforementioned internal signals: 'sleep_count' and 'sleep_status'. 'sleep_count' is a 10-bit register that increments when both 'InputL' and 'InputR' are zero and resets otherwise. 'sleep_status' is a 1-bit register signal that switches to high when 'sleep_count' reaches 800 and maintains there as long as both input signals remain zero indicating that the system can enter sleep mode. The reset in 'sleep_status' brings the system back to active mode. \n\nThe module's main code is structured into several blocks that handle different tasks including reset operations and the detection of zero levels in inputs. If 'Reset_n' is low, 'sleep_count' and 'sleep_status' are reset. Then it checks if both 'InputL' and 'InputR' are zero, 'sleep_count' increments and 'sleep_status' remains zero. If either of them registers a non-zero value, 'sleep_count' resets and 'sleep_status' remains zero. \n\nFinally, if 'sleep_count' reaches or exceeds 800, it remains constant at this value and 'sleep_status' switches to indicating sleep mode. This module also includes two inputs 'OutReady' and 'col' that are not utilized in the current implementation. The 'Zero_detector' module plays an integral role in power management of the system by controlling the transition between active and sleep modes based on the input signals.",

Reset_n: This line is a reset signal. When it is low (0) the 'sleep_count' and 'sleep_status' will reset to zero.\n3. InputL and InputR: These are 16-bit input signals which need to be monitored for zero detection.\n4. OutReady: This is another input signal, although in the provided code, it's not used. \n5. col: This is a 32-bit input line. However, just like 'OutReady', 'col' is not used in the provided code.\n\nOutput Ports:\n1. sleep_status: This signal is used as an indicator for the system to enter sleep mode. Default is '0' (active mode). When 'sleep_count' reaches 800 and maintains this state for some duration (both 'InputL' and 'InputR' are '0'), the 'sleep_status' will switch to '1', indicating the system should enter sleep mode. \n\nExplanation: \nThis hardware module named 'Zero_detector' works as a system sleep-mode manager system. It keeps counting zero levels in 'InputL' and 'InputR' and when the count reaches 800, it makes 'sleep_status' high and it stays high as long as it keeps on detecting zero on both inputs, indicating that the system should enter sleep mode. If one of the signals goes high, it resets the 'sleep_count' to zero. Also, it supports a reset functionality that would reset 'sleep_count' and 'sleep_status' whenever 'Reset_n' pin goes low. Two inputs: 'OutReady' and 'col' are unused in this module."
