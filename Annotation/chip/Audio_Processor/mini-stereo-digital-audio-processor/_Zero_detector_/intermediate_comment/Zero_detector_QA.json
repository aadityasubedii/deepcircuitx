It's getting triggered at positive edge of 'in_status'. Upon reset (when Reset_n == 0), the 'sleep_count' and 'sleep_status' are reset to zero. Then, if both input signals are at zero, 'sleep_count' starts to increment, while 'sleep_status' remains at zero. If either signal registers a non-zero input, 'sleep_count' resets and 'sleep_status' remains zero. When 'sleep_count' equals or exceeds 800, it is held at 800 and 'sleep_status' switches to 1, indicating the system should enter sleep mode, likely because both inputs have remained at zero level for a significant duration."

Reset_n: This line is a reset signal. When it is low (0) the 'sleep_count' and 'sleep_status' will reset to zero.\n3. InputL and InputR: These are 16-bit input signals which need to be monitored for zero detection.\n4. OutReady: This is another input signal, although in the provided code, it's not used. \n5. col: This is a 32-bit input line. However, just like 'OutReady', 'col' is not used in the provided code.\n\nOutput Ports:\n1. sleep_status: This signal is used as an indicator for the system to enter sleep mode. Default is '0' (active mode). When 'sleep_count' reaches 800 and maintains this state for some duration (both 'InputL' and 'InputR' are '0'), the 'sleep_status' will switch to '1', indicating the system should enter sleep mode. \n\nExplanation: \nThis hardware module named 'Zero_detector' works as a system sleep-mode manager system. It keeps counting zero levels in 'InputL' and 'InputR' and when the count reaches 800, it makes 'sleep_status' high and it stays high as long as it keeps on detecting zero on both inputs, indicating that the system should enter sleep mode. If one of the signals goes high, it resets the 'sleep_count' to zero. Also, it supports a reset functionality that would reset 'sleep_count' and 'sleep_status' whenever 'Reset_n' pin goes low. Two inputs: 'OutReady' and 'col' are unused in this module."
