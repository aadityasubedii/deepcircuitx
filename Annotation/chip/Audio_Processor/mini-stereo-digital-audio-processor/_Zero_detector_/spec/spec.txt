Module name: Zero_detector

Module specification: The 'Zero_detector' module is a hardware module designed to manage the sleep mode of a system based on the input signals namely 'InputL' and 'InputR'. It operates by continuously monitoring these two 16-bit input signals for zero levels. The input signals are triggered at the positive edge of the 'in_status' control signal. The functionality of the module is controlled by a reset line 'Reset_n', which when goes low, resets the internal signals 'sleep_count' and 'sleep_status' to zero. 

The main functionality of this module revolves around the aforementioned internal signals: 'sleep_count' and 'sleep_status'. 'sleep_count' is a 10-bit register that increments when both 'InputL' and 'InputR' are zero and resets otherwise. 'sleep_status' is a 1-bit register signal that switches to high when 'sleep_count' reaches 800 and maintains there as long as both input signals remain zero indicating that the system can enter sleep mode. The reset in 'sleep_status' brings the system back to active mode. 

The module's main code is structured into several blocks that handle different tasks including reset operations and the detection of zero levels in inputs. If 'Reset_n' is low, 'sleep_count' and 'sleep_status' are reset. Then it checks if both 'InputL' and 'InputR' are zero, 'sleep_count' increments and 'sleep_status' remains zero. If either of them registers a non-zero value, 'sleep_count' resets and 'sleep_status' remains zero. 

Finally, if 'sleep_count' reaches or exceeds 800, it remains constant at this value and 'sleep_status' switches to indicating sleep mode. This module also includes two inputs 'OutReady' and 'col' that are not utilized in the current implementation. The 'Zero_detector' module plays an integral role in power management of the system by controlling the transition between active and sleep modes based on the input signals.
