Comment: 
This block of code defines a state register for a state machine, which gets updated at the rising edge of the clock or falling edge of Reset_n. It performs a synchronous reset based on the condition of Reset_n. When Reset_n is low, the present state gets reset, or otherwise, state_present is loaded with next state. If the present state is greater than 4, it will be reset; otherwise, the present state moves to the next state. If Reset_n is high, independent of the present stateâ€™s value, state_present gets updated to the next state.
