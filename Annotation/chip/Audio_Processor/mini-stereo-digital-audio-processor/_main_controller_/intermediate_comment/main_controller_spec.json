    "spec": "Module name: main_controller.\n\nModule specification:\n\nThe main_controller module is a complex construct that serves as a pivotal part of a larger system. Focusing on managing states involved in data reading and writing, the module is triggered by various control signals like Start, Frame, Reset_n, among others. Its primary functionality is to detect and hold the present and the next state, keep count through these various states, and feed appropriate enable signals, providing an overall coordination for the system behavior.\n\nThe main_controller module takes in several input ports: Sclk and Dclk, which are clock signals used to synchronize the data transfer and state changes; Start, a control signal indicating the beginning of an operation; Reset_n, an active low signal guiding the system to its initial state; Frame, a signal indicating the start of the next data frame; in_flag, a control that signifies when the input data is ready; flag_zeroL and flag_zeroR that flag when the left and right data channels are zero. These inputs are used to steer the state transitions and operations of the module.\n\nThe output ports, which are a combination of registers and signals, shape the stages of writing operations as well as mirror the state of the system. They include rjwrite, coeffwrite, and datawrite for writing output data; rj_enable, coeff_enable, and data_enable, signals to enable or disable writing operation; Clear signal to return the system to its initial state; Frame_out, Dclk_out, and Sclk_out, mirror signals of input Frame, Dclk, and Sclk respectively; work_enable, sleep_flag, and InReady signals indicating the functioning state and readiness of the system.\n\nThe internal signals, i.e., state_present, state_next, count, count_rj, count_coeff, count_data, and tk, function to track the current state, the next state, and the count of data processed in each state. Both state_present and state_next are integral to sustaining the flow of the program, as they respectively hold the current and next state of the state machine. The tk signal acts as a crucial element in synchronization among different parts of the system as it controls read/write operations.\n\nThe main_controller module exhibits a robust architecture consisting of different blocks for each state such as start of operation, waiting for input data, reading data, resetting, and sleeping. Each block consists of logical commands that effectively control the flow of the program from one state to the other, providing carefully measured responses to various signals and data inputs, leading to the smooth functioning of the overall system.",

Sclk: Serial clock signal used to synchronize the state changes and the processing of the input/output data.\n2. Dclk: Data clock signal used to indicate the rate at which the data is transferred.\n3. Start: Control signal used to indicate the start of the operation. \n4. Reset_n: Active low reset signal used for returning the system to its initial state.\n5. Frame: Signal used to indicate the end of the current frame of data and the start of the next one.\n6. in_flag: Input flag used to indicate when input data is available.\n7. flag_zeroL: Flag used to indicate when the left data channel is zero.\n8. flag_zeroR: Flag used to indicate when the right data channel is zero.\n\nExplanation: These input ports are control signals that help define the state transitions and operations of the module based on the current state and input data.\n\nOutput Ports:\n1. rjwrite, coeffwrite, datawrite: Registers used to write the output data.\n2. rj_enable, coeff_enable, data_enable: Signals used to enable the corresponding writing operation to the above registers.\n3. Clear: Signal used to clear all states and return to initial operation.\n4. Frame_out: Output representation of the Frame signal. \n5. Dclk_out, Sclk_out: Output representation of the Dclk and Sclk signals. \n6. work_enable: Signal used to indicate when the system is working.\n7. sleep_flag: Signal used to indicate when the system is in sleep mode.\n8. InReady: Signal used to indicate when the system is ready for the next input. \n\nExplanation: These output ports are used to control the various stages of the writing operation and to indicate the state of the system (i.e., working, sleeping, etc.). They also provide a mirror of the input clock signals and Frame signal for other modules or systems to observe or sync with."

This state machine operates the logic of the flow of control in the system.\n2) state_next: This is used to hold the next state of the state machine which will be the state_present in the next clock cycle. This allows for control of the flow of the program during clock transitions.\n3) count: This is a counter that increments as the data is being processed. It can be used for tracking the amount of data processed or the progression of a process over time.\n4) count_rj, count_coeff, count_data: These are counter signals which are supposed to keep a count of the piece of data being written or read in the respective phases of rj, coeff, or data.\n5) tk: This signal likely acts as a token to control read/write operations. Specifically, it prevents re-reading or re-writing of data by marking whether the current data read/write operation has completed. Thus, tk plays a crucial role in synchronizing different parts of the system."

Focusing on managing states involved in data reading and writing, the module is triggered by various control signals like Start, Frame, Reset_n, among others. Its primary functionality is to detect and hold the present and the next state, keep count through these various states, and feed appropriate enable signals, providing an overall coordination for the system behavior.\n\nThe main_controller module takes in several input ports: Sclk and Dclk, which are clock signals used to synchronize the data transfer and state changes; Start, a control signal indicating the beginning of an operation; Reset_n, an active low signal guiding the system to its initial state; Frame, a signal indicating the start of the next data frame; in_flag, a control that signifies when the input data is ready; flag_zeroL and flag_zeroR that flag when the left and right data channels are zero. These inputs are used to steer the state transitions and operations of the module.\n\nThe output ports, which are a combination of registers and signals, shape the stages of writing operations as well as mirror the state of the system. They include rjwrite, coeffwrite, and datawrite for writing output data; rj_enable, coeff_enable, and data_enable, signals to enable or disable writing operation; Clear signal to return the system to its initial state; Frame_out, Dclk_out, and Sclk_out, mirror signals of input Frame, Dclk, and Sclk respectively; work_enable, sleep_flag, and InReady signals indicating the functioning state and readiness of the system.\n\nThe internal signals, i.e., state_present, state_next, count, count_rj, count_coeff, count_data, and tk, function to track the current state, the next state, and the count of data processed in each state. Both state_present and state_next are integral to sustaining the flow of the program, as they respectively hold the current and next state of the state machine. The tk signal acts as a crucial element in synchronization among different parts of the system as it controls read/write operations.\n\nThe main_controller module exhibits a robust architecture consisting of different blocks for each state such as start of operation, waiting for input data, reading data, resetting, and sleeping. Each block consists of logical commands that effectively control the flow of the program from one state to the other, providing carefully measured responses to various signals and data inputs, leading to the smooth functioning of the overall system."

This state machine operates the logic of the flow of control in the system.\n2) state_next: This is used to hold the next state of the state machine which will be the state_present in the next clock cycle. This allows for control of the flow of the program during clock transitions.\n3) count: This is a counter that increments as the data is being processed. It can be used for tracking the amount of data processed or the progression of a process over time.\n4) count_rj, count_coeff, count_data: These are counter signals which are supposed to keep a count of the piece of data being written or read in the respective phases of rj, coeff, or data.\n5) tk: This signal likely acts as a token to control read/write operations.

Focusing on managing states involved in data reading and writing, the module is triggered by various control signals like Start, Frame, Reset_n, among others. Its primary functionality is to detect and hold the present and the next state, keep count through these various states, and feed appropriate enable signals, providing an overall coordination for the system behavior.\n\nThe main_controller module takes in several input ports: Sclk and Dclk, which are clock signals used to synchronize the data transfer and state changes; Start, a control signal indicating the beginning of an operation; Reset_n, an active low signal guiding the system to its initial state; Frame, a signal indicating the start of the next data frame; in_flag, a control that signifies when the input data is ready; flag_zeroL and flag_zeroR that flag when the left and right data channels are zero. These inputs are used to steer the state transitions and operations of the module.\n\nThe output ports, which are a combination of registers and signals, shape the stages of writing operations as well as mirror the state of the system. They include rjwrite, coeffwrite, and datawrite for writing output data; rj_enable, coeff_enable, and data_enable, signals to enable or disable writing operation; Clear signal to return the system to its initial state; Frame_out, Dclk_out, and Sclk_out, mirror signals of input Frame, Dclk, and Sclk respectively; work_enable, sleep_flag, and InReady signals indicating the functioning state and readiness of the system.\n\nThe internal signals, i.e., state_present, state_next, count, count_rj, count_coeff, count_data, and tk, function to track the current state, the next state, and the count of data processed in each state. Both state_present and state_next are integral to sustaining the flow of the program, as they respectively hold the current and next state of the state machine. The tk signal acts as a crucial element in synchronization among different parts of the system as it controls read/write operations.\n\nThe main_controller module exhibits a robust architecture consisting of different blocks for each state such as start of operation, waiting for input data, reading data, resetting, and sleeping. Each block consists of logical commands that effectively control the flow of the program from one state to the other, providing carefully measured responses to various signals and data inputs, leading to the smooth functioning of the overall system."
