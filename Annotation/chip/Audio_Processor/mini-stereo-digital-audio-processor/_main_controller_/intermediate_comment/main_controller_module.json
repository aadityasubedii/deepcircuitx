    "module": "Module-level comment: The main_controller module manages states involved in data reading and writing. It uses input control signals to transition states and feeds enable signals based on these transitions. Inputs include Sclk, Dclk, Start, Reset_n, Frame, in_flag, flag_zeroL, and flag_zeroR, each for respective synchronization and control operations. Outputs like state representations and write enable signals reflect current operation and data flow. Internal signals such as state_present, state_next, count, and tk track state progress and data processing. The module contains different blocks for each state operation performing a specific task, shaping the overall system's behavior."
