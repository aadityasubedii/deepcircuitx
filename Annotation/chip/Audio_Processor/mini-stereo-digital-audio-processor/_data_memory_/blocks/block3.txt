This block of code defines a memory write operation. The operation only occurs on the positive edge (rising edge) of the system clock (`Sclk`). It checks whether the `write_enable` signal is high (1'b1). If it is, it writes the input data (`in_data`) to the `datamem` at the index `datawrite`. If the `write_enable` signal is not high, the content of the `datamem` stays the same. The data index where the operation is performed is determined by the value of `datawrite`.
