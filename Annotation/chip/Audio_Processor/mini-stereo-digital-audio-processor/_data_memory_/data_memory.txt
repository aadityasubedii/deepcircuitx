Module-level comment: The 'data_memory' module serves as a memory storage unit, supporting write and read operations. Write/read actions are managed via write_enable/read_enable inputs. It also checks for consecutive zero inputs and flags after a defined limit. The memory storage is embodied in a 16-bit 256-location array 'datamem'. A 'count_zero' register counts zero-inputs until a set limit, raising the 'flag_zero'. These functionalities are implemented in two 'always' blocks and a conditional data assignment section.
