It has input ports for receiving data and control signals, and output ports for transmitting data and a flag. The module includes two 'always' blocks. The first block writes input data to the memory array 'datamem' if the 'write_enable' signal is asserted. The second block increments 'count_zero' if 'in_data' is 0, and sets 'flag_zero' when 'count_zero' reaches a specific limit. If 'in_data' is not 0, 'count_zero' and 'flag_zero' are both reset. The module further assigns data from 'datamem' to 'input_data' if 'read_enable' signal is asserted, or assigns 0 to 'input_data' if 'read_enable' is de-asserted."
