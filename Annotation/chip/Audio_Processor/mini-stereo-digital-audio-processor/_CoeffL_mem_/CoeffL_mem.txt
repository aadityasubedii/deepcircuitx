Module-level comment: The CoeffL_mem module is a memory storage unit that stores and retrieves data. It operates on a system clock and initiates operations at the positive edge of 'coeff_status'. Data is stored at the 'row'-indexed location of a 512-lot(internal array 'coeffl') memory block, cleared when 'clear' is flagged. 'Index_coeffL' tells where to retrieve data. The output 'coeffdataL' carries the memory block's retrieved data. An internal signal 'r' serves as an iterator for the 'clear' function.
