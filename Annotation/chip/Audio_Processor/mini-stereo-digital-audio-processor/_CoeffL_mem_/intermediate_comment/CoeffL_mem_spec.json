    "spec": "Module name: CoeffL_mem. \n\nModule specification: The CoeffL_mem is a memory storage unit specifically designed for storing and retrieving data. The module works on a system clock signal 'Sclk', and the operations are carried out at the positive edge of the control signal 'coeff_status'. The module consists of five input ports: 'clear', 'row', 'Input', 'index_coeffL', and two control signals 'Sclk' and 'coeff_status'. 'Clear' is a reset signal, which when set high, clears the entire memory block. 'Row' and 'Input' are 9-bit and 16-bit signals respectively that work together to store the given input data at the specified index location in the memory. 'Index_coeffL' is another 9-bit signal used to specify the index from where the data must be retrieved. The module possesses a singular 16-bit output port named 'coeffdataL', which retrieves the data from the memory block at the index location specified by 'index_coeffL'. Two internal signals operate within the CoeffL_mem module. 'Coeffl' is a memory storage array capable of holding 512 16-bit data units. The other internal signal 'r' functions as a loop iterator for the 'clear' operation, resetting the memory blocks within 'coeffl'. The module functionality is divided into two major blocks: The first block clears the memory when 'clear' is high, and the second block stores the input data in memory at the 'row' location when 'clear' is not set. The output is assigned outside these blocks where 'coeffdataL', the output port, is assigned the value retrieved from the memory block 'coeffl' at the 'index_coeffL' location.",
