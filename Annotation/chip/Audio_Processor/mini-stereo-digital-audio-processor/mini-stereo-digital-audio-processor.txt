The mini-stereo-digital-audio-processor repository houses a comprehensive digital audio processing system explicitly designed for stereo input signals. It integrates a series of specialized modules, including memory units like InL_mem and InR_mem for dynamic data storage, an array of signal convertors like the P2S (Parallel to Serial) and S2P (Serial to Parallel) for data format transformation, and computational units such as the AdderL and AdderR for arithmetic operations. Additionally, the repository contains control mechanisms such as the Controller and ALU_Controller modules that oversee operations and data flow through state machine logic and synchronous processing. Memory management is facilitated through specific modules like CoeffL_mem, CoeffR_mem, RjL_mem, and RjR_mem, which handle data retrieval and storage efficiently. Moreover, data signal adjustment is performed using sign extension in the SignextL and SignextR modules, and auxiliary modules such as the ShifterL and ShifterR accomplish logical and arithmetic shifts. The repository ensures data integrity and operation validation through Zero_detector and maintest modules, which monitor input signals for specified conditions and simulate overall system performance respectively. Overall, the repository supports a robust digital signal processing architecture, promoting optimized handling, and manipulation of stereo audio signals, ensuring systematic execution of conversions, storage, and arithmetic operations within a controlled digital environment.
