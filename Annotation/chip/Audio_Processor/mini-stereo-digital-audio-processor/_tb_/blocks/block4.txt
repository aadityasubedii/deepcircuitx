This block of code is responsible for opening a file in Verilog for data writing. The execution of this task is carried out utilizing the "$fopen" system task which is a native functionality in Verilog. This system task opens the file "output2.txt" in write and read mode ("w+"), as commanded. The file descriptor for this open file is then stored in the variable "mv". This operation is wrapped inside an initial block, which specifies that this operation should be performed at the start of the simulation.
