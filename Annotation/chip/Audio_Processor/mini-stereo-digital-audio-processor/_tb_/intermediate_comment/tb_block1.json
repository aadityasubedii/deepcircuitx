    "block_comment": "This block functions as a synchronous data write mechanism which captures output register values and writes them into the 'writeL' and 'writeR' arrays on every negative edge of 'Sclk' if 'OutReady' signal is high. It works by assigning values from 'OutputL_reg' and 'OutputR_reg' registers to 'writeL', 'writeR', 'OutputL', and 'OutputR' variables and then, decrementing the value of 'l'. If 'l' becomes negative and 'count' is less than 6395, it writes 'writeL' and 'writeR' to a file (except when count equals 3798 and 5397), increments 'count', and resets 'l' to 39."
