    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes variables and loads input data for a module. First, it sets the Dclk, Sclk, Frame, InputL, InputR, and Reset_n variables to particular initial states. Then it invokes the $readmemh task to read hex data from a file \"data2.in\" into the 'data' array. After this initialization, it triggers 'Start' to begin processing, which is subsequently reset after a 2-timeunit delay. Finally, there's a conditional check: When the 'count' reaches 6394, the simulation will finish using the $finish system task."
