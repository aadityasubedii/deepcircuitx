It takes in signals like clock (Sclk), a status signal for coefficients (coeff_status), a clear signal (clear), an index input (index_coeffR), and a 9-bit row and 16-bit Input. Whenever coeff_status is high, if the clear signal is active, the contents of coeffr, which presumably is the coefficient memory, are all set to zero. If the row is less than 512, the input is stored in that row location of coeffr. The selected coefficient based on index_coeffR value is then output through coeffdataR."
