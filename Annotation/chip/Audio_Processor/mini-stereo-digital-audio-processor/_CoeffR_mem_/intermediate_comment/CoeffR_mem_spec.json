It operates on clock signal 'Sclk', status signal 'coeff_status', reset signal 'clear', a 9-bit row index 'row', a 16-bit input data 'Input', and a 9-bit index 'index_coeffR'. When a positive edge of 'coeff_status' occurs, if 'clear' is high, it resets the entire coefficient memory block 'coeffr' to zero using a 10-bit index 'r' running through a loop. If the clear signal is not high and 'row'<512 it allows the 'Input' data to be stored at the 'row' index of the 'coeffr' array. The output of the module 'coeffdataR', is the 16-bit data retrieved from the 'coeffr' array at the 'index_coeffR' index. Internally, this module uses a 16-bit reg array 'coeffr' to hold data, acting like a memory block, and a 10-bit reg index 'r' for clearing this array when required. The module's operation is primarily divided between the 'always' block where data write and resets are handled, and an 'assign' statement where data is read out from the coeffr array.",
