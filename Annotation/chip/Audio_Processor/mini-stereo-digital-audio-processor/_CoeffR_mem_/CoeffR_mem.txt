Module-level comment: The CoeffR_mem module functions as a coefficient memory block. It takes in clock, status, clear signals along with data input 'Input' and indices 'row', 'index_coeffR'. On a positive edge of 'coeff_status', if 'clear' is high, 'coeffr' (a 512-element array) is reset to zero. If 'clear' is not high and 'row'<512, 'Input' is stored at 'row' index in 'coeffr'. The 'coeffdataR' output maps the data at 'index_coeffR' index from 'coeffr' array. The module uses 'r' as an incrementing loop index to clear 'coeffr'.
