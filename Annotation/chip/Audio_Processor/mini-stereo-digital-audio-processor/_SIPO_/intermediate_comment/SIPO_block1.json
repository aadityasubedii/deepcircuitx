    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronizing mechanism for data processing. It uses a falling edge clock (Dclk) or a global reset (Clear) to synchronize operations. On receipt of a Clear signal, it defaults all variables (count_bit, dataL, dataR, in_flag, frame_stat) to their initial values. Without a Clear signal, it checks for the Frame signal, if present, it initiates a new frame for InputL & InputR while setting the frame status 'frame_stat' as high. If a frame is already ongoing (indicated by frame_stat), it continues to fill in the data (dataL, dataR) and reduces the bit count 'count_bit'. Upon completion of a frame (indicated by count_bit reaching zero), it sets the input flag 'in_flag', resetting the frame status. If the Frame input is low during an inactive frame (frame_stat low), it resets all variables to their default state."
