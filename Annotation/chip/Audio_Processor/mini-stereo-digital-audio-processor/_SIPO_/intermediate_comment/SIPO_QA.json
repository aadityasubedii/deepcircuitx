It is a type of shift register where serial input data (InputL, InputR) is parallelized in outputs dataL and dataR bits. The bits are shifted down for each clock cycle until the shift register is full, upon which an in_flag is set to indicate the completion of a frame. This is repeated for each frame of data.
