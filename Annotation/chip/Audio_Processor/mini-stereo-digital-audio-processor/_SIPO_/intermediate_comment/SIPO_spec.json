    "spec": "Module name: SIPO. \n\nModule specification: The SIPO (Serial-In Parallel-Out) module acts as a shift register, parallelizing serial input data into output data bits in Verilog RTL code. The module accepts five inputs: Frame, Dclk, Clear, InputL, and InputR. The 'Frame' signal denotes the start of a new data frame, 'Dclk' acts as the clock signal for the process, 'Clear' is utilized to reset the module parameters, and 'InputL' and 'InputR' are the serial input data. SIPO produces three output signals: in_flag, dataL, and dataR. 'in_flag' is a flag output signal set when the shift register completes a data frame. 'dataL' and 'dataR' are parallel output signals updated with each clock cycle. The module comprises two internal signals: 'count_bit', a 4-bit counter tracking the number of processed bits, and 'frame_stat', a status flag tracking the current frame state. The module's operation is controlled by its always block which is triggered on the falling edge of Dclk or rising edge of Clear. It governs data flow control, frame building/resetting, and updating output and internal signals accordingly.",
