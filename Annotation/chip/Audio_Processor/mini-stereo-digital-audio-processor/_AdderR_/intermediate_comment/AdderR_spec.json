    "spec": "Module name: AdderR. \n\nModule specification: The AdderR module is a flexible arithmetic logic unit that performs either an addition or subtraction operation. The functionality of the module is determined by the binary input `addorsubR`. If `addorsubR` is set to 1, the module subtracts the 40-bit wide input `addip2R` from `addip1R`. If `addorsubR` is set to 0, the module adds `addip1R` and `addip2R`. The result of the operation is stored and provided on a 40-bit wide output register `addopR`. The arithmetic operation is performed and the output register `addopR` is updated whenever any of the input values (`addip1R`, `addip2R`, `addorsubR`) change. The `add_statusR` input seems to be redundant as its significance is not defined in the module. The module has a simple structure with a single always block that effectively executes either addition or subtraction based on the `addorsubR` signal state. This overview provides a comprehensive understanding of the AdderR module's functionality.",
