    "block_comment": "This block of code implements an adder/subtractor operation in a hardware design. The action is determined by the `addorsubR` input signal: when it is high (`1'b1`), the block performs subtraction (`addopR=addip1R-addip2R`); when `addorsubR` is low (`1'b0`), the block performs addition (`addopR=addip1R+addip2R`). The operation is triggered upon any change in `addip1R`, `addip2R`, or `addorsubR` signals."
