Module-level comment: The AdderR module either adds or subtracts two 40-bit wide inputs, `addip1R` and `addip2R`, based on the single bit control signal `addorsubR`. If `addorsubR` is 1, subtraction is performed, else (if 0), addition is performed. The result is stored in the 40-bit wide output register `addopR`. The operation is triggered by any changes in the inputs. The seemingly redundant input `add_statusR` is not used within the module. Operation is implemented within a single always block.
