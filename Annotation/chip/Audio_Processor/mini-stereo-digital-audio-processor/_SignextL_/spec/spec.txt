Module name: SignextL. 

Module specification: The SignextL module in Verilog is a sign extension module designed to operate on a 16-bit input signal named `signinL` and output a 40-bit signal named `signoutL`. The sign extension operation is governed by the clock signal `Sclk` and the binary signal `sign_statusL`. When the `sign_statusL` is 1, at every positive edge of the clock signal, the module checks the highest bit of the `signinL` and accordingly extends its sign to a 40-bit internal register `padL`. If the highest bit of `signinL` is '1', indicating a negative number in two's complement format, `padL`'s higher order bits [39:32] are filled with '1'. Otherwise, for a '0' indicating a positive number, they are filled with '0'. In the end, the value in `padL` is transferred to `signoutL`. The module thus reflects the function of a sign extension property in digital design, facilitating operations with signed numbers.
