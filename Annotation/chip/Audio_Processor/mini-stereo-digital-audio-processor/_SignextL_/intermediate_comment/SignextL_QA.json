It takes an input signal and checks the sign status. According to the sign status, it extends the sign of the `signinL` 16-bit input to a 40-bit register `padL`. If the highest bit of `signinL` is 1, then `padL` is filled with '1's in its higher order bits [39:32]. If the highest bit of `signinL` is '0', then `padL` is filled with '0's in its higher order bits [39:32]. Finally, `signoutL`, a 40-bit output register, is assigned the value of `padL`. This operation is performed at every positive edge of the clock signal `Sclk`."
