    "module": "Module-level comment: The SignextL module performs sign extension on a 16-bit input `signinL`, producing a 40-bit output `signoutL`. When enabled by `sign_statusL` at every positive edge of the clock, it fills higher order bits of the internal register `padL` based on the sign bit of `signinL` (1 fills with '1's, '0' with '0's), which is then assigned to `signoutL`.\n"
