It takes two inputs - shift_statusR which is a control signal, and shiftipR which is a 40-bit data to be shifted. If the control signal, shift_statusR, is 1, it performs a signed right shift, effectively dividing the input data by 2. If the control signal is not 1, the output is equated to 0. The final result is stored in the output variable, shiftopR."
