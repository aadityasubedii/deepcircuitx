    "spec": "Module name: ShifterR.\n\nModule specification: The ShifterR module performs a signed right shift operation on a 40-bit data input. This module takes two inputs: a control signal (shift_statusR) and a 40-bit data input (shiftipR). If the control signal (shift_statusR) is a '1', it performs a signed right shift on the shiftipR, effectively dividing the input data by 2. If the control signal is not '1', it sets the  output (shiftopR) to 0. The final result of this operation is stored in the output register, shiftopR.\n\nThe module consists of the following ports: \n- Input ports: shift_statusR and shiftipR. shift_statusR is the control signal that triggers the signed right shift operation on shiftipR. shiftipR is the 40-bit data input which is to be shifted. \n- Output ports: shiftopR. shiftopR is a 40-bit register capturing the result of the shift operation performed on the input data. If shift_statusR is 1, then shiftopR equals shiftipR shift right by 1 position. If it is not 1, shiftopR is set to 0.\n\nThe module uses an internal signal, shiftopR, which is a 40-bit register to capture the results of the shift operation. The register is updated within the 'always' block in the code based on the condition if shift_statusR is '1'.\n\nThe code broadly consists of mainly one block. The 'always' block performs the registered shift operation on the input data as per the stated conditions. The shift operation is performed when shift_statusR is '1' by using the signed shift right operator (>>>) to preserve the sign, while in other cases it sets the shiftopR to 0. This block forms the core logic of the module, executing the described behavior of ShifterR.",
