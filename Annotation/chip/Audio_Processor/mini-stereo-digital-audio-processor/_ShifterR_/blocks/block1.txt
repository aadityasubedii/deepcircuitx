Comment: 
This block manages the right shifting of a given input based on the condition of a status variable. When status variable, `shift_statusR`, is equal to 1, the signed integer of `shiftipR` is right-shifted by one bit position, else a zero is assigned to `shiftopR`. The `always` block is sensitive to changes in `shift_statusR` and `shiftipR`.
