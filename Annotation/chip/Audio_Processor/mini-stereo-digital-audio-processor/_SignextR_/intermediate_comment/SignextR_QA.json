It's job is to extend the most significant bit or sign bit of a smaller bit value to produce a value which has a greater number of bits. If sign_statusR input is 1, it checks the most significant bit of the 16-bit signinR input. If the MSB is 1, padR is extended to 40 bits with leading 1s, otherwise, it is extended with leading 0s. The value of signinR is always placed on bits [31:16] of padR. The output, signoutR, is updated with the value of padR at each positive edge of the system clock Sclk."
