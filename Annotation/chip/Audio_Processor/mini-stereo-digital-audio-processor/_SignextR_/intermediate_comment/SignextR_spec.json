    "spec": "Module name: SignextR. \n\nModule specification: The SignextR is a sign-extension unit implemented in Verilog. Its core functionality includes extending the most significant bit (sign bit) of a smaller bit value to produce a value with significantly more bits. Specifically, the module monitors the most significant bit of the 16-bit signinR input when the sign_statusR input is active (1). The module performs bit extension by extending 40 bits of either all 1s or all 0s with the value of signinR placed on bits [31:16] of padR (a 40-bit internal register signal), based on the state of signinR's most significant bit. \n\nFor input ports, the module takes Sclk (system clock), sign_statusR (a single bit determining extension operation activation), and signinR (a 16-bit input signal to be sign-extended). Regarding output, the module sends out signoutR, which is a 40-bit register that gets updated with the processed value at each positive edge of the system clock when sign extension is enabled. \n\nThe internal signal in this module is the register 'padR' holding the extended value of signinR. In terms of operation, the code section within \"always @ (posedge Sclk)\" block, encapsulates the logic operations dependent on the system clock's positive edge. The operation is only conducted when sign_statusR is active (1), and the outcome depends on the state of the most significant bit from signinR. As a result, the module successfully extends the input signal with respect to its sign bit, updating its output at each positive clock edge.",
