    "block_comment": "This block is a Sign-extension block for a 16-bit input. At the rising edge of the system clock, it checks whether sign extension is required (`sign_statusR==1`). If required and the most significant bit of the 16-bit input (`signinR[15]`) is '1', it prepares a 40-bit output `padR` filled with all '1's, and then places the 16-bit input at the bits 16 to 31 of `padR`. Otherwise, it prepares a 40-bit output `padR` filled with all '0's and places the 16-bit input similarly. Finally, `padR` is assigned to `signoutR`, thereby extending the sign of the 16-bit input to 40 bits."
