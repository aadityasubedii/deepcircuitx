Module-level comment: The SignextR module, implemented in Verilog, sign-extends a 16-bit input (signinR) to 40 bits. The extension is controlled by the sign_statusR flag. If flag is active ('1'), signinR is sign-extended using an internal register padR based on signinR's MSB. signoutR outputs the processed value synchronized with each positive edge of the provided system clock (Sclk).
