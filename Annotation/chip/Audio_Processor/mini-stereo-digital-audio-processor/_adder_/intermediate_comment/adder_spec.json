    "spec": "Module name: adder. \n\nModule specification: The \"adder\" is a Verilog RTL module designed for binary arithmetic operations. This module performs either an addition or subtraction operation, controlled by the \"addsub\" input. If the \"addsub\" signal is high (1'b1), it performs a subtraction operation (b - a); whereas if the \"addsub\" signal is low (1'b0), it performs an addition operation (b + a). The output is held in the \"sum\". This module has three main input ports: two 40-bit operands \"a\" and \"b\", and a control signal \"addsub\". There is also an auxiliary \"adder_en\" signal which is typically utilized as an enable signal - despite being defined, it is not in use in the provided snippet of this Verilog RTL code. Furthermore, there is a 40-bit wide output port called \"sum\", where the result of the performed arithmetic operation is stored. The module does not use any internal signals. The code contains a single always block that selects between addition and subtraction based on the \"addsub\" control input. In essence, it's a fundamental arithmetic operation block serving as a small component in the larger hardware design.",
