    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a memory buffer `rjl` on a rising edge trigger of `rj_status`. When the `clear` input signal is high, it resets all the 512 entries of the `rjl` buffer to zero. In the absence of the `clear` signal or post-cleanup, if the `row` value is less than 16, the code overwrites the corresponding `rjl` entry with the current `Input` value."
