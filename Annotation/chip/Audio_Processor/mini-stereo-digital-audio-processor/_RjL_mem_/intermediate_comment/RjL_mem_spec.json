The purpose of this module is to store, retrieve, or clear 16-bit data values based on the given control signals. The module has inputs as 'Sclk' (unused system clock), 'rj_status' (a signal that triggers writing into the LUT on its positive edge), 'clear' (a signal that clears the LUT when high), 'row' (a 4-bit control to specify the row to write data to), 'Input' (a 16-bit control which is the data to be written in the LUT), and 'index_rjL' (a 4-bit index specifying the row to read data from). The only output signal form this module is 'rjdataL', which is  a 16-bit data output from the LUT given at the row specified by 'index_rjL'. \n\nInternally, the module utilizes a 16x16 register array or look-up table 'rjl', and a 10-bit register 'r'. The register rjl is used for storage and retrieval of the 16-bit words through specified row indices, while the register 'r' essentially serves as an intermediate variable for the table clearing operation. \n\nThe code for this module contains three different parts: A declaration section, where the input, output, and registers are declared.
