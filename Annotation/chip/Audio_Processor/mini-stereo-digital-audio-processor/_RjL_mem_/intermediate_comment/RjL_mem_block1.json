    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of an element from array `rjl[]` to the variable `rjdataL`. Specifically, the indexed element of `rjl[]` array which is denoted by the variable `index_rjL` is retrieved and its value is stored in `rjdataL`. This simple assignment operation allows the `rjdataL` to get the exact value from a specific element in `rjl[]` array, thereby providing access and control over the individual elements of this array based on the current value of the index variable `index_rjL`."
