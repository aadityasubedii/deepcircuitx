Module-level comment: The RjL_mem module operates as a 16-row lookup table (LUT) capable of storing and retrieving 16-bit words, with control signaled by the input 'rj_status'. The LUT can be cleared, and words can be written or read through 'clear', 'row', and 'index_rjL' inputs respectively, with data output being 'rjdataL'. Internally, a 16x16 bit-sized register array 'rjl', along with a 10-bit register 'r', ensure smooth transition of tasks like write, read, or clear at specific indices. The table-clearing function appears to implement a redundant loop using 'r', requiring code optimization.
