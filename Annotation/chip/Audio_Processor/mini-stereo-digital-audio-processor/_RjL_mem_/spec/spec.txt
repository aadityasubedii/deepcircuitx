Module name: RjL_mem. 

Module specification: The RjL_mem is a module that represents a 16x16 look-up table (LUT), the functionality of which is governed by a synchronous write and clear operation. The purpose of this module is to store, retrieve, or clear 16-bit data values based on the given control signals. The module has inputs as 'Sclk' (unused system clock), 'rj_status' (a signal that triggers writing into the LUT on its positive edge), 'clear' (a signal that clears the LUT when high), 'row' (a 4-bit control to specify the row to write data to), 'Input' (a 16-bit control which is the data to be written in the LUT), and 'index_rjL' (a 4-bit index specifying the row to read data from). The only output signal form this module is 'rjdataL', which is  a 16-bit data output from the LUT given at the row specified by 'index_rjL'. 

Internally, the module utilizes a 16x16 register array or look-up table 'rjl', and a 10-bit register 'r'. The register rjl is used for storage and retrieval of the 16-bit words through specified row indices, while the register 'r' essentially serves as an intermediate variable for the table clearing operation. 

The code for this module contains three different parts: A declaration section, where the input, output, and registers are declared. A procedural block, triggered at the positive edge of rj_status, which handles the write operation and the clearing of the LUT depending on the control signals 'clear' and 'row.' An assignment statement that assigns the data at the index specified by 'index_rjL' in the rjl LUT to the output 'rjdataL'.
