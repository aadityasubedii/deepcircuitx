    "spec": "Module name: RjR_mem. \n\nModule specification: The RjR_mem is a custom RTL module that implements a simple memory storage and retrieval system with a clear functionality. The following inputs control the way this module behaves: system clock (Sclk) signal, status (rj_status) signal, reset/clear signal, 4-bit row input, 16-bit data Input, and 4-bit index_rjR. The memory module is clocked by the Sclk signal, and with the rj_status signal it performs a write operation. Upon a positive edge of the rj_status signal and when the row value is less than 16, the module writes the 16-bit input data into 'rjr' memory location at the position specified by 'row'. The clear signal when high, resets the data stored in the 'rjr' memory cells to 0 with the help of the iterator 'r' running for 512 iterations. Index_rjR is used as the source of the index to read data from the 'rjr' memory. The 4-bit index_rjR input value serves as the index to the rjr memory for the read operation; the 16-bit data given by the rjr[index_rjR] is the output of this module. The output port is rjdataR that delivers the result of the read operation. The memory, thus, is implemented as a 16-location register array of 16-bits each named as rjr. With this arrangement, it allows a maximum of 16 distinct 16-bit data inputs to be stored. In addition, the clear functionality uses another 10-bit register 'r' to count up to 512 times and clear the memory. This module seems to be a part of a larger system and carry out memory management tasks.",

It takes inputs such as the system clock (Sclk), status signal (rj_status), row number, and an input data (Input) along with a row index (index_rjR) and a reset/clear signal. It uses these signals for operations such as writing (Input becomes memory content at row number 'row') and clearing all memory cells which are represented by the reg array 'rjr'. Another significant operation is data read using the index_rjR, the read data is the output \"rjdataR\". Using the row number 'row' and the status signal 'rj_status' it carries out the memory management tasks. When the 'clear' signal is activated (set to 1), it clears (sets to 0) all the data stored in the memory cells.
