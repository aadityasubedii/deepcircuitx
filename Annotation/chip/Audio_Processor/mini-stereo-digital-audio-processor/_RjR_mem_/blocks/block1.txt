This block is responsible for assigning a read data value from a vector. The value selected is based on an index pointing to a specific position. The index_rjR variable specifies the position and 'rjr' is the input vector from which value gets selected. Thus, 'rjdataR' gets assigned the value corresponding to the position mentioned in 'index_rjR' from the vector 'rjr'.
