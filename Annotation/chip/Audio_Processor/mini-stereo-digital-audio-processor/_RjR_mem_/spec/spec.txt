Module name: RjR_mem. 

Module specification: The RjR_mem is a custom RTL module that implements a simple memory storage and retrieval system with a clear functionality. The following inputs control the way this module behaves: system clock (Sclk) signal, status (rj_status) signal, reset/clear signal, 4-bit row input, 16-bit data Input, and 4-bit index_rjR. The memory module is clocked by the Sclk signal, and with the rj_status signal it performs a write operation. Upon a positive edge of the rj_status signal and when the row value is less than 16, the module writes the 16-bit input data into 'rjr' memory location at the position specified by 'row'. The clear signal when high, resets the data stored in the 'rjr' memory cells to 0 with the help of the iterator 'r' running for 512 iterations. Index_rjR is used as the source of the index to read data from the 'rjr' memory. The 4-bit index_rjR input value serves as the index to the rjr memory for the read operation; the 16-bit data given by the rjr[index_rjR] is the output of this module. The output port is rjdataR that delivers the result of the read operation. The memory, thus, is implemented as a 16-location register array of 16-bits each named as rjr. With this arrangement, it allows a maximum of 16 distinct 16-bit data inputs to be stored. In addition, the clear functionality uses another 10-bit register 'r' to count up to 512 times and clear the memory. This module seems to be a part of a larger system and carry out memory management tasks.
