Module-level comment: RjR_mem is a memory management module for storing and retrieving 16-bit data. It utilizes a 16-location register array 'rjr' for memory storage, with the location specified by the 4-bit 'row'. On a positive edge of the 'rj_status' signal, data from 'Input' is stored into 'rjr[row]'. The module also supports clearing of all memory locations, triggered by the high state of the 'clear' signal, which iterates 512 times using a counting register 'r'. For data retrieval, 'index_rjR' is used as an index to fetch data from 'rjr' as output 'rjdataR'.
