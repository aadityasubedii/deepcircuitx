    "module": "Module-level comment: // The MULT module is a simple Verilog hardware design. Its functionality is unspecified, but the name suggests it might perform multiplication. It takes a 10-bit input 'dataa' and provides a 24-bit output 'result'. The specific implementation details are undefined in this part of code. No internal signal is defined within this module."
