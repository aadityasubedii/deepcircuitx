The multiplexed display output is converted from binary to BCD (Binary Coded Decimal), and then from BCD to a 7-segment display code. The update rate of this system is handled by a clock divider, generating a tick signal at 10kHz."

This tick signal is used to trigger the updating of various components in the system at specific intervals (10kHz).\n- DATA: This 10-bit bus is used to retrieve data from the ROM module and send to the Digital-to-Analog Converter and PWM module for output.\n- BCD0, BCD1, BCD2, BCD3, BCD4: These are 4-bit signals converted from the 24-bit output 'MULT_RES'.
