    "module": "Module-level comment: The ex14_top module reads data from a ROM and outputs to an ADC and a PWM module. It also multiplies a 10-bit switch input by 10k, presenting it on five 7-segment displays. The module uses a clock divider to produce a 10kHz pulse from a 50MHz clock signal, driving the overall update rate of the system. It uses modules for ROM data retrieval, multiplication, DAC/PWM signaling, binary to BCD conversion, 7-segment display code conversion, and ROM addressing through a cumulative switch input counting mechanism."
