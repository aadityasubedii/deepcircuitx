    "spec": "Module name: ex14_top.\n\nModule specification: The ex14_top module is a top-level hardware component for a system that interfaces with a ROM, Digital-to-Analog converters, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) unit, and a series of seven-segment displays. With the foundation of a 50MHz clock signal (CLOCK_50), the main functionality of this module is to read data from a ROM, send it to a DAC and a PWM module for analog and digital representation respectively, and present a tenfold representation of a switch input to the hexadecimal displays after conversion to Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) form. In terms of inputs, the module accepts a clock signal (CLOCK_50) and a 10-bit switch input signal (SW). The outputs are five 7-bit signals that drive five 7-segment displays (HEX0-HEX4), four control and data signals for the DAC (DAC_SDI, DAC_CS, DAC_SCK, DAC_LD), and an output for PWM signal (PWM_OUT). The internal signals critical to the operation of this module are TICK_10KHz, DATA, BCD0-BCD4, MULT_RES, and COUNT, with roles ranging from scaling clock signals, storing data from ROM, conversion of binary results to BCD format, preserving multiplication operation outputs, to maintaining a cumulative sum of switch inputs on 10kHz increments. The various blocks in the code encompass a clock divider, ROM data retrieval, DAC, PWM, multiplication, binary to BCD conversion, and seven-segment display conversion components, all instrumental in translating the binary data to user-friendly analog and visual representations.",
