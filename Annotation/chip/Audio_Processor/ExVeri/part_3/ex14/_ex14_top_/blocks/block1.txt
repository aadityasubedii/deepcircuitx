Comment: 
This code block serves as a counter, incrementing a variable "COUNT" on the rising edge of a 10kHz tick. The count is increased by the value of another variable "SW". For every positive edge (rising edge) detected on the "TICK_10KHz" signal, the value of "COUNT" is updated with the summation of the old "COUNT" and the variable "SW".
