    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, named MULT, is a combinational module with the sole function of multiplying a 10-bit input 'dataa' with a constant value '2710' to give a 24-bit output 'result'. Internally, it uses a multiplier component 'lpm_mult_component', configured for maximum speed and unsigned operation, which directly takes 'dataa' and 'sub_wire0' (with fixed value '2710') as inputs and stores the result in 'sub_wire1', which is then passed on to output 'result'."
