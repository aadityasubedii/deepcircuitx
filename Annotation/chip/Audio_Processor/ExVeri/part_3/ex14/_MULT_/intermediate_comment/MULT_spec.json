    "spec": "Module name: MULT. \n\nModule specification: The MULT module carries out a multiplication operation. It is designed on a purely combinational logic basis without the dependency on any clock signal, reset signal, or clock enable signal. It essentially multiplies a 10-bit input 'dataa' with a fixed 14-bit value '2710' (in decimal equivalent to 10000) and outputs a 24-bit result. The module comprises one input port and one output port. The input port 'dataa' serves as the variable operand in the multiplication operation, whereas the 24-bit output port 'result' is used to communicate the multiplication outcome. \n\nInside the module, three internal wires are declared: 'sub_wire0', 'sub_wire1', and 'result'. Here, 'sub_wire0' is a constant wire that is initialized with the value '2710'. The wire 'sub_wire1' is used to store multiplication results generated by 'lpm_mult_component', an instance of the multiplier component 'lpm_mult'. The wire 'result' is directly connected to 'sub_wire1', thereby taking on the multiplication result of the latter and giving out as the module's output.\n\nThe functional blocks in the code primarily consist of the declaration and initialization of input, output, and internal wires, and the instantiation of the multiplier component 'lpm_mult_component'. The 'lpm_mult_component' performs the core multiplication operation by accepting 'dataa' and 'sub_wire0' as operands, and storing the product in 'sub_wire1'. The parameters of 'lpm_mult_component' are specifically set to maximize speed, ensure unsigned representation, and suit the widths of input, output, and product.",
