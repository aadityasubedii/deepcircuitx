    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\n\"The 'pwm' module is designed to load a 10-bit 'data_in' into a register 'd' on a posedge of 'clk' when 'load' is high. The module includes input ports 'clk', 'data_in', and 'load', and a register/output port 'pwm_out'. It employs internal registers 'd' and 'count', though 'count' and 'pwm_out' are not used to effectuate a PWM signal as suggested by the module name. Essential functionality missing in the current implementation.\""
