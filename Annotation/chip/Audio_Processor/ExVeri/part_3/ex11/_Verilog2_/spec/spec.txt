Module name: pwm. 

Module specification: The 'pwm' module, standing for Pulse Width Modulation, is designed to load a 10-bit 'data_in' value into an internal 'd' register whenever a control 'load' signal high occurs on a positive clock edge. Despite its name, the current implementation doesn't generate a PWM signal, and parts of the code seem to be missing. 

The module utilizes three input ports: 'clk', 'data_in', and 'load'. 'clk' serves as the clock signal, essential for the sequential logic within the module, 'data_in' signifies a 10-bit input data which is loaded into the 'd' register on a 'load' signal high. 

The output port, 'pwm_out', in a complete code, should showcase the generated PWM signal, but with the provided code, it doesn't produce any output as the logic to control it is missing. 

The internal signals include 'd', a 10-bit register signal that takes the value of 'data_in' on a particular condition, 'count', another 10-bit register, typically used in a functional PWM generator but unused in the current code, and 'pwm_out' acting both as an internal register and an output port. 

The distinct section present within the verilog code is a clocked process block which assigns the value of 'data_in' to 'd' when a posedge of 'clk' is encountered, and 'load' is high. Note: in a fully functional 'pwm' module, there should be additional code to effectively use 'count' and 'pwm_out' to formulate a PWM output signal.
