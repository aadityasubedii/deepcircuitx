    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'ex11_top' module acts as the central managing unit, driving sub-modules 'clktick_16', 'pwm', and 'spi2dac'. It controls data flow and operations triggered by the 'SW' and 'CLOCK_50' inputs. The 'tick' events from 'clktick_16' and 'load' operations are coordinated for data transmission. Outputs 'DAC_CS', 'DAC_SDI', 'DAC_LD', 'DAC_SCK', and 'PWM_OUT' are used for DAC control and PWM signal generation. It defines the implementation of PWM and SPI communication with DAC."
