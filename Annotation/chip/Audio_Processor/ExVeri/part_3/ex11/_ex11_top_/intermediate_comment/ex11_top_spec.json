    "spec": "Module name: ex11_top.\n\nModule specification: The 'ex11_top' module is a high-level module that incorporates and drives other sub-modules, acting as the central hub for managing different operations. This module receives a 10-bit array of switches (SW) and a clock signal (CLOCK_50) as its input. The 'SW' array is employed to control and pass data to other integrated modules, while 'CLOCK_50' assists with the synchronization and timing inside the module. \n\nThe module delivers output signals named 'DAC_CS', 'DAC_SDI', 'DAC_LD', 'DAC_SCK', and 'PWM_OUT'. 'DAC_CS' enables or disables the DAC, 'DAC_SDI' sends data to DAC, 'DAC_LD' signals when to load data into the DAC, 'DAC_SCK' provides a clock pulse for SPI communication with DAC, and 'PWM_OUT' creates a PWM signal for controlling various electric devices. \n\nTwo internal wire signals 'load' and 'tick' are also present. The 'load' signal acts as a control signal determining when the load data operation should occur in the 'pwm' and 'spi2dac' sub-modules. The 'tick' signal generates regular time events in the module, which interacts with the 'load' signal, indicating that the event's timing correlates with the data loading operation. \n\nSpecific segments in the 'ex11_top' module encapsulate three other modules, namely 'clktick_16', 'pwm', and 'spi2dac'. The 'clktick_16' module provides the 'tick' events, while the 'pwm' module is driven by inputs 'CLOCK_50', 'SW', and 'load' and creates a 'PWM_OUT' signal. The 'spi2dac' module communicates with DAC through SPI protocol, managed by signals from 'CLOCK_50', 'SW', and 'load' inputs and 'DAC_SDI', 'DAC_CS', 'DAC_SCK', and 'DAC_LD' outputs.",
