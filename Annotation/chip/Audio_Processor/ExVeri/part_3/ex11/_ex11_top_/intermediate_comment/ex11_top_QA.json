The module has multiple inputs, which include an array of switches (SW) and a clock signal (CLOCK_50). Outputs are control signals for a DAC device and a PWM signal. This module also has instances of the 'clktick_16', 'pwm' and 'spi2dac' modules, and it manages clock ticks and loading operations with the help of wires 'tick' and 'load'."
