It uses an input switch (SW) to set a value 'd' and an incrementing counter. On every clock edge, it increments the counter by one. If the counter value is more than 'd', the output (pwm_out) is set to LOW (0), else it is HIGH (1). The 'load' input controls when the switch value is loaded into 'd'. Therefore, the output pulse width changes depending upon the value of 'd', which is set by 'SW'."
