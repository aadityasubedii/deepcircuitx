    "block_comment": "The block primarily functions as a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) generator that periodically outputs a high or low signal. The implementation relies on a counter that increments at every positive edge of a 50 MHz CLOCK signal. This counter is compared to a threshold value 'd'. If the counter's value exceeds 'd', a low signal (0) is generated; otherwise, a high signal (1) is output."
