    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the synchronization of input to the system clock. At every rising edge (posedge) of the 50 MHz clock signal (CLOCK_50), it checks the status of 'load'. When 'load' is in high state (1), the state of d is updated to follow the current state of the switch (SW). This allows the system to acknowledge the state change of inputs at specific intervals, providing a predictable execution schedule."
