Module-level comment: This is the 'pwm' module; a PWM signal generator using a digital circuit setup. Its operation is controlled by the CLOCK_50 clock signal. The module reads a 10-bit 'SW' value when 'load' is HIGH and uses this to modulate the pulse width of the 'pwm_out' signal. The modulating is done by incrementing a counter 'count' at each clock pulse and setting 'pwm_out' HIGH if 'count' remains less than 'SW', and LOW otherwise. The overall result is a PWM signal with its duty cycle modulated by the 'SW' input.
