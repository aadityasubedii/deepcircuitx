    "spec": "Module name: ROM. Module specification: The ROM (Read-Only Memory) module is a synchronous memory component implemented using Altera's altsyncram component with a data width and address of 10 bits. This module uses two inputs, a 10-bit 'address' and a single-bit 'clock' signal. The 'address' input is used to identify the ROM location whose data needs to be read, whereas the 'clock' input provides a timing reference that controls when the read operation should occur. The module outputs the read data on a 10-bit 'q' output signal. Internally, the module uses a 10-bit signal 'sub_wire0' which connects the 'q_a' output from the 'altsyncram' component to the 'q' output of the module, thus passing on the fetched data from the ROM memory to the 'q' output on each clock cycle. The initial contents of the ROM are preloaded from the file './rom_data.mif/rom_data.mif', and the ROM is read-only and does not allow any runtime modification, as determined by the 'lpm_hint' parameter.",

The ROM data is likely initialized from the file './rom_data.mif/rom_data.mif' which is specified in the defparam statements.

All the read operations occur at either the rising or falling edge of the clock signal. \n\nExplanation: These input ports are essential in defining when and from which memory address the data will be read.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. `q` - It is a 10-bit output which delivers the data read from the ROM memory as per the address input on each clock cycle. \n\nExplanation: This output port gives us the data that comes out from a particular address location in the ROM.

Specifically, it is connected to the 'q_a' output of the 'altsyncram' component. 'q_a' of 'altsyncram' provides the read data output from the ROM memory. This internal wire is acting as an intermediary between the 'altsyncram' component's output and the output of the ROM module 'q'. Therefore, whatever data is read from the ROM memory based on the address input and clock, it appears at 'q_a' which is connected to 'sub_wire0'. The ROM module's output 'q' is assigned to be equal to 'sub_wire0', thus passing on the read data to the output 'q'. It does not affect the functional behaviour of the ROM but aids in routing of signals within the component."
