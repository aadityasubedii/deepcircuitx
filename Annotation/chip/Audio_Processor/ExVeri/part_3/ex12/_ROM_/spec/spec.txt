Module name: ROM. Module specification: The ROM (Read-Only Memory) module is a synchronous memory component implemented using Altera's altsyncram component with a data width and address of 10 bits. This module uses two inputs, a 10-bit 'address' and a single-bit 'clock' signal. The 'address' input is used to identify the ROM location whose data needs to be read, whereas the 'clock' input provides a timing reference that controls when the read operation should occur. The module outputs the read data on a 10-bit 'q' output signal. Internally, the module uses a 10-bit signal 'sub_wire0' which connects the 'q_a' output from the 'altsyncram' component to the 'q' output of the module, thus passing on the fetched data from the ROM memory to the 'q' output on each clock cycle. The initial contents of the ROM are preloaded from the file './rom_data.mif/rom_data.mif', and the ROM is read-only and does not allow any runtime modification, as determined by the 'lpm_hint' parameter.
