Module-level comment: The ROM (Read-Only Memory) module is a synchronous memory unit that reads predefined data from specific locations defined by a 10-bit 'address' input on a clock cycle. The data read from the defined memory location is outputted on a 10-bit 'q'. An internal wire 'sub_wire0' connects the output from the Altera's 'altsyncram' component to the module's 'q' output, thereby transferring the fetched data. The preloading of the ROM's content is via the './rom_data.mif/rom_data.mif' file, and no runtime modification is allowed.
