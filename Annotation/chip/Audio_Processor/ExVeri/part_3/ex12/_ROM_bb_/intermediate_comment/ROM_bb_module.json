    "module": "Module-level comment: This ROM module is a skeletal Verilog template often used for implementing Read-Only Memory (ROM). It includes input ports for address (10-bit) and clock, and a 10-bit output port 'q'. Typically, 'address' would specify a memory location, 'clock' would handle synchronization, and 'q' would output data from the specified address. However, this module doesn't contain the necessary internal signals or logic to achieve these functionalities and 'q' is unassigned. 'clock' is unusually declared as 'tri1'. Missing sections surrounded by `ifndef ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS are placeholders for condition-specific implementations."
