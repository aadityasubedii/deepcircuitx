    "spec": "Module name: ROM. \n\nModule specification: The ROM is an incomplete module template in Verilog, typically representing a Read-Only Memory design that can retain non-volatile data. This module contains three ports - two inputs and one output. The \"address\" is a 10-bit input that would typically correspond to the specific address within the ROM from which data is to be read. The \"clock\" input would serve as the synchronizing signal for coordinating the read operations. Unusually, it's declared here as 'tri1', a wire type with high impedance state. The 10-bit \"q\" is an output, which in a completely implemented ROM module would output the data stored at the location specified by the input 'address'. However, in this incomplete template, \"q\" isn't assigned any value. This module doesn't define any internal signals or functions, nor does it implement any particular functionality apart from the module interface. There are compiler directives ('ifndef ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS' sections) that suggest missing sections of the code specific to a certain condition, but the content of these conditional sections aren't specified in this template. All these factors point to this module being a placeholder or an incomplete stub for a future, more complete ROM design implementation.",
