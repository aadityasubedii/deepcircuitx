The module generates outputs, \"HEX0\" to \"HEX4\", transformed to 7-segment hexadecimal format to be displayed on a 7-segment display. Inside the module, various internal signals such as \"ROM_OUT\", a 10-bit signal from a Read-Only Memory (ROM), and \"BCD0\" to \"BCD4\", 4-bit signals holding the Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) values, are used for interconnections among submodules. The module \"ex12_top\" employs three types of submodules: a ROM submodule named \"rom1\" which provides outputs based on the switch state, a binary to BCD converter module named \"display\" which takes the ROM output to generate BCD values, and five instances of \"hex_to_7seg\" modules which convert these BCD values to drive 7-segment hexadecimal displays. The functionality of the top module revolves around transforming ROM outputs to a viewable hexadecimal representation on a 7-segment display system, where \"HEX0\" represents the least significant digit and \"HEX4\" stands for the most significant digit. All operations are synchronized using the master clock signal \"CLOCK_50\".",

It takes as inputs a clock signal (CLOCK_50) and a 10-bit switch signal (SW). It gives outputs as 7 segment hexadecimal indications(HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, HEX3, HEX4). Inside the module, it first connects to a Read Only Memory (ROM) submodule \"rom1\" where it reads the ROM data according to the switches' state at the clock's positive edge. Then, it transforms the binary outputs from ROM to Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) using the \"bin2bcd_16\" submodule \"display\".
