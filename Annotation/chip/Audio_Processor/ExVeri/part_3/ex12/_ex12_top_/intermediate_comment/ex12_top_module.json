    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"ex12_top\" module manages the transformation of ROM outputs into hexadecimal data for 7-segment displays using switch indications and a clock signal. It utilizes a ROM submodule \"rom1\" to fetch outputs based on the switch state, a \"bin2bcd_16\" converter called \"display\" to convert the binary ROM outputs to BCD, and five \"hex_to_7seg\" modules for converting the BCD signals into 7-segment hexadecimal signals. All operations are synchronized with the \"CLOCK_50\"."
