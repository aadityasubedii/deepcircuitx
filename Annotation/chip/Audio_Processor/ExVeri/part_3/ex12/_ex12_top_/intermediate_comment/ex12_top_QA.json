It takes as inputs a clock signal (CLOCK_50) and a 10-bit switch signal (SW). It gives outputs as 7 segment hexadecimal indications(HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, HEX3, HEX4). Inside the module, it first connects to a Read Only Memory (ROM) submodule \"rom1\" where it reads the ROM data according to the switches' state at the clock's positive edge. Then, it transforms the binary outputs from ROM to Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) using the \"bin2bcd_16\" submodule \"display\". Finally, it connects to five \"hex_to_7seg\" submodules, which convert each BCD to a hexadecimal 7-segment display signal."

All the sub-modules work aligned with this clock signal.\n- SW: It is an array of inputs [9:0] which probably represents the status of 10 manual switches. It is used as an address to fetch data from a ROM memory.\n\nOutput ports: HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, HEX3, HEX4. \nExplanation: \n- HEX0 to HEX4: These are the 7-bit output ports that are connected to 7-segment display modules for hexadecimal representation. The data represented by these output ports are taken from the ROM output after converting it into Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) and then to 7-segment hexadecimal. Each output port HEX0-HEX4 corresponds to a digit in the 7-segment display, where HEX0 represents the least significant digit and HEX4 the most significant digit."

The ROM data are selected according to the switch status (SW) and are updated at the positive edge of the clock signal (CLOCK_50).\n- BCD0 to BCD4: These are 4-bit internal signals which carry the outputs of the binary-to-BCD converter submodule. BCD conversion is a technique to convert a binary number into a decimal number where each digit represents a decimal digit. In this case, a 16-bit binary number {6'b0, ROM_OUT} is converted into five, 4-bit, BCD numbers (BCD0 to BCD4).
