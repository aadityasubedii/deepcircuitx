Module name: ex12_top. 

Module specification: This top-level module, named "ex12_top", accepts two inputs "CLOCK_50", the master clock signal, and "SW" which is a ten-bit switch indication signal. The module generates outputs, "HEX0" to "HEX4", transformed to 7-segment hexadecimal format to be displayed on a 7-segment display. Inside the module, various internal signals such as "ROM_OUT", a 10-bit signal from a Read-Only Memory (ROM), and "BCD0" to "BCD4", 4-bit signals holding the Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) values, are used for interconnections among submodules. The module "ex12_top" employs three types of submodules: a ROM submodule named "rom1" which provides outputs based on the switch state, a binary to BCD converter module named "display" which takes the ROM output to generate BCD values, and five instances of "hex_to_7seg" modules which convert these BCD values to drive 7-segment hexadecimal displays. The functionality of the top module revolves around transforming ROM outputs to a viewable hexadecimal representation on a 7-segment display system, where "HEX0" represents the least significant digit and "HEX4" stands for the most significant digit. All operations are synchronized using the master clock signal "CLOCK_50".
