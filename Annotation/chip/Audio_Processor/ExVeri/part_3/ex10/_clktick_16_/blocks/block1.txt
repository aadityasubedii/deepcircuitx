Comment: 
This block of Verilog code defines a frequency divider or counter. Upon a positive edge of the input clock signal (`clkin`), the counter(`count`) increases by one; once the count reaches 500, it resets, and a `tick` signal is generated. The tick signal serves as an indicator that the designated threshold has been reached while the counter variable holds the current count.
