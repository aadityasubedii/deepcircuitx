    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code initializes a variable called `tick` to be a 1-bit binary value of 0. The \"initial\" keyword in Verilog is used to set the initial condition or value for a register variable at the start of a simulation. So at the start, `tick` will show low or off signal. This block doesn't contain any more than that; it's a very simple initial setting for a signal with no further action or function."
