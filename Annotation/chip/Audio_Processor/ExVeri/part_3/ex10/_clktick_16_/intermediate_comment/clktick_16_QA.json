The counter 'count' increases each clock cycle and is reset back to zero when it hits 500, simultaneously setting the 'tick' high. On every other clock cycle, 'tick' is 0. This module is useful for situations where a slower clock or specific timing signal is needed."

It is the primary source which each positive edge causes 'count' to increment and when 'count' reaches 500, 'tick' is generated.\n\nOutput ports: tick. Explanation: tick is an output signal that goes high for one clock cycle whenever 'count' reaches 500 (every 500 cycles of the clkin input).

When 'count' hits 500 cycle count, it resets to zero and simultaneously sets 'tick' high.\n   \n2. tick is a single bit internal register that acts as an output signal.
