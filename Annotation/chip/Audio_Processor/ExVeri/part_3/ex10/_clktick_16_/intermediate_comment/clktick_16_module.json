    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'clktick_16' module acts as a clock divider, dividing incoming clock ('clkin') pulses and producing an output signal ('tick') each 500th cycle. This is implemented using a 14-bit register 'count' incremented with each positive edge of 'clkin' until reaching 500. Once at this point, 'count' is reset, and 'tick' is briefly driven high before being reset to low, producing a slower clock signal."
