    "spec": "Module name: clktick_16.\n\nModule specification: The 'clktick_16' module, as the name suggests, acts as a clock ticker that serves as a clock divider. Utilizing the input 'clkin', this module divides the incoming clock signal, generating an output signal 'tick' every 500 clock cycles. More specifically, it contains internally a 14-bit register 'count', which accumulates the number of clock cycles for 'clkin'. On each positive edge of 'clkin', 'count' increments by one. When 'count' reaches 500, the module resets 'count' back to zero and simultaneously drives 'tick' high for one clock cycle before it is set back to 0 by the always block which is sensitive to the positive edge of clkin. This module is particularly useful in situations where a slower or specific timing signal that is a fraction of the input clock signal 'clkin' is required.",
