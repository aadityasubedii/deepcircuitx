Module name: ex10_top. 

Module specification: The 'ex10_top' module acts as a driver interface to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) using the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol. It takes a 10-bit trigger signal 'SW' and a clock signal 'CLOCK_50' as inputs, with 'SW' serving as the input data for DAC and 'CLOCK_50' providing the clock frequency for the SPI interface. Four output ports, 'DAC_CS', 'DAC_SDI', 'DAC_LD', 'DAC_SCK', are part of the SPI protocol designed to interface with the DAC. 'DAC_CS' is the Chip/Slave Select signal, 'DAC_SDI' provides the Serial Data Input, 'DAC_LD' is the Load Control signal for the DAC, and 'DAC_SCK' synchronizes the data transmission via the clock signal. Within the module, two internal signals 'load' and 'tick' are employed. 'load' acts as a trigger for DAC data load operation and 'tick' provides clock ticks for the data loading which provides synchronization with the input clock. The module comprises of two blocks, 'clktick_16' which generates the 'tick' signal and the 'spi2dac' block which primarily controls the SPI communication with DAC. The 'tick' signal triggers the 'load' which in turn initiates the data loading to the SPI module - 'spi2dac'.
