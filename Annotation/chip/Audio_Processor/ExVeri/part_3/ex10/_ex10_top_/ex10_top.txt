Module-level comment: The 'ex10_top' module serves as an SPI interface to a DAC. It takes a 10-bit data 'SW' and a clock 'CLOCK_50' as inputs. Through the 'clktick_16' block, it generates a 'tick' signal which triggers data load ('load') for the 'spi2dac' block. The outputs 'DAC_CS', 'DAC_SDI', 'DAC_LD', 'DAC_SCK' are SPI control signals for the DAC implementing DAC data load and communication synchronization.
