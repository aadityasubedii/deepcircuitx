    "module": "Module-level comment: The mult_24 module performs multiplication of a 10-bit input with a constant, outputting a 24-bit result. It utilizes a lpm_mult component from Altera's library, which is optimized for speed. The 10-bit input 'dataa' is multiplied with the constant '2710' (hexadecimal), using internal wires for operation handling. The product of multiplication, stored in 'sub_wire1', is directly assigned to the output port 'result'. Control signals are static, ensuring module operation is independent of any external control."
