    "block_comment": "This block of code is a counter which increments by `a2d_data` every time a rising edge is detected on `TICK_10KHz` signal. The counter, `COUNT`, is asynchronously updated at every 10kHz clock (`TICK_10KHz`) tick, thus adding the current `a2d_data` value to the `COUNT` at each tick."
