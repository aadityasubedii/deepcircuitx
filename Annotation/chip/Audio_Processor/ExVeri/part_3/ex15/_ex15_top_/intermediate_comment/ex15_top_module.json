    "module": "Module-level comment: The ex15_top module serves as the top level for a mixed-signal processing system, interfacing with ADC and DAC components, decoding data to five hexadecimal displays and providing a PWM output. Operation is managed primarily with a 10kHz tick derived from a 50MHz system clock. Internal to the system, data is managed via a ROM, spi modules for ADC/DAC, a PWM generator, a binary to BCD converter, a multiplier, and a 10-bit register serving as a counter. Different synchronous operations are coordinated with this modular design."
