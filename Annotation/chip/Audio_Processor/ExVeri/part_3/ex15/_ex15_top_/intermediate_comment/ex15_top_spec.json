The module is clocked at 50MHZ, provided through the CLOCK_50 input port. It operates with an ADC via the ADC_SDO input port and control signals ADC_CS, ADC_SCK, and ADC_SDI output ports. It interfaces with a DAC through control signals DAC_SDI, DAC_CS, DAC_SCK, DAC_LD output ports. HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, HEX3, HEX4 serve as output ports for data to be displayed on a hexadecimal display. PWM_OUT produces a Pulse Width Modulation output. Internal signals include TICK_10KHz, used for managing operations at 10kHz, DATA as a ROM output, and a2d_data carrying digitized measurements from the ADC. BCD0 to BCD4 convert binary to BCD for the hexadecimal display. MULT_RES holds multiplication results used for display conversion. COUNT serves as a counter incrementing regularly with data from ADC. This module consists of several submodules: a clock divider clktick_16 to generate a clock tick at 10kHz, ROM and spi-related modules for data management, a PWM generator, a multiplier and a binary to BCD converter for display purposes. \n",

It takes a 50MHz clock input and signals from an Analog Digital Converter (ADC), and outputs control and data to a Digital Analog Converter (DAC), a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output, ADC control signals, and displays data on hexadecimal digit displays. It uses the following submodules: clktick_16 to generate a clock tick at 10kHz, a Read Only Memory (ROM) to provide data at regular intervals, spi2adc and spi2dac to convert data between the SPI digital format and the analog format, a multiplier (mult_24 times_10k) and a binary to BCD converter (bin2bcd_16) to generate display data, and a pwm submodule to provide a PWM output. It also has a counter, COUNT, which increments with ADC data on each 10kHz tick."

ADC_SDO: This is the Serial Data Out line from the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). It carries the digitized measurements from the ADC to the system.\n\nExplanation: \nThe input ports act as signals into the system. The CLOCK_50 provides a regular reference timing pulse for synchronous operations, and ADC_SDO which is the signal containing the data output by an ADC.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. ADC_CS (ADC Chip Select), ADC_SCK (ADC Serial Clock), ADC_SDI (ADC Serial Data In): These are control and data signals for the ADC. The SDI carries digital information to the ADC, while the CS and SCK lines manage communication timing.\n2. HEX0 - HEX4: These are 7-bit outputs that drive five hexadecimal display elements for displaying data.\n3. DAC_SDI (DAC Serial Data In), DAC_CS (DAC Chip Select), DAC_SCK (DAC Serial Clock), DAC_LD (DAC Load): These are control and data input signals for the Digital to Analog Converter (DAC). They control the timing of operation and data transmitted to the DAC.\n4. PWM_OUT: It is a Pulse Width Modulation output, possibly used for controlling power or other analog outputs based on the data signal.\n\nExplanation: \nThe output ports are signals that communicate with the DAC, Hex displays, and provide a PWM output. The DAC-related signals (like DAC_SDI, DAC_CS, DAC_SCK, DAC_LD) coordinate data transmission and signal conversion for the DAC. The HEX related ports are used as outputs to displace necessary data on a HEX display. The PWM_OUT signal is a type of output typically used for motor control or other applications."
