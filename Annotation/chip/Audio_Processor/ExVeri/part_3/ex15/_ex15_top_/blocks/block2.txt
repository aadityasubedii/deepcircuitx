Comment: 
This block of code initializes a variable named "COUNT". It uses the Verilog keyword `initial` to set the initial value of COUNT to 0. The base of the number is explicitly defined as binary (indicated by the 'b' notation) and the width of the number is set as 10 bits wide (indicated by the '10' before 'b'). It is essentially setting up a 10-bit register with an initial value of all zeros.
