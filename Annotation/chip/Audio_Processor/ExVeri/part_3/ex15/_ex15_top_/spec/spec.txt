Module name: ex15_top. 

Module specification: The ex15_top module is the top-level module acting as an interface for a mixed-signal processing system. The module is clocked at 50MHZ, provided through the CLOCK_50 input port. It operates with an ADC via the ADC_SDO input port and control signals ADC_CS, ADC_SCK, and ADC_SDI output ports. It interfaces with a DAC through control signals DAC_SDI, DAC_CS, DAC_SCK, DAC_LD output ports. HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, HEX3, HEX4 serve as output ports for data to be displayed on a hexadecimal display. PWM_OUT produces a Pulse Width Modulation output. Internal signals include TICK_10KHz, used for managing operations at 10kHz, DATA as a ROM output, and a2d_data carrying digitized measurements from the ADC. BCD0 to BCD4 convert binary to BCD for the hexadecimal display. MULT_RES holds multiplication results used for display conversion. COUNT serves as a counter incrementing regularly with data from ADC. This module consists of several submodules: a clock divider clktick_16 to generate a clock tick at 10kHz, ROM and spi-related modules for data management, a PWM generator, a multiplier and a binary to BCD converter for display purposes.
