    "module": "Module-level comment: The mult_24 module, given its name, is possibly purposed for multiplication operations yielding a 24-bit result. However, currently it does not perform any operation. There is a 10-bit input port, 'dataa', and a 24-bit output 'result' which do not interact with any internal logic as no such logic is implemented in this version of the code. Thus, it currently acts as a simple declaration of input and output ports without any functionality. Future versions are expected to contain the module's computation logic."
