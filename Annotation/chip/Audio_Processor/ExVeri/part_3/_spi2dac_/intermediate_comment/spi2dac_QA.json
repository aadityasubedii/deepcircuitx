The SPI interface takes a 10-bit digital input, processes it internally and sends the resultant digital output to a DAC. The generation of this output happens on the rising edge of a system clock. The module has several states to control and define its behaviour. Specifically, the states allow it to wait for an instruction to load data, to set an internal counter and to control a shift register. Physically, this module would be used to convert digital data into analog signals, for further use in a broader system. Control operations such as buffering, gain adjustment, and shutting down can be selected from the parameters in the code. All the functionality is driven on the edge of the system clock (sysclk) and influenced by the loading signal (load)."

It is a 10-bit wide port where the source data is loaded from.\n- load: This is the control signal input port.

The transformed binary data from data_in is output from here.\n- dac_cs: This output is the \"chip select\" signal for the DAC. Active low-like. It is a control signal to activate the output process to the DAC.  \n- dac_sck: This output port delivers the generated clock signal for the DAC.
