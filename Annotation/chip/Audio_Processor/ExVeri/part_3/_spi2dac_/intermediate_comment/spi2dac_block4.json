    "block_comment": "The Verilog block serves as a state machine to control the selection of a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) and its data load operation. It sets default values for the dac_cs (DAC select) and dac_ld (DAC load), and makes decisions based on the variable 'state'. In the state '0', it selects the DAC by asserting the dac_cs line. In the state '17', it deselects the DAC and then changes the dac_ld control line to prevent the DAC from loading data. For all other states, it deselects the DAC and enables loading, thereby maintaining the default state."
