    "block_comment": "The block of code initializes the significant variables for the operation of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) system. The system is put into its idle state by assigning the \"IDLE\" value to the \"sr_state\" variable, and the DAC operation is stopped or hasn't been started yet, as is indicated by assigning the \"1'b0\" (zero) to the \"dac_start\" variable."
