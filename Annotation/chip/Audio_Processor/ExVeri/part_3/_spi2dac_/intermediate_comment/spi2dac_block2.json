    "block_comment": "This block implements a shift register in Verilog, primarily used in the communication interface like SPI where data and commands are being shifted out sequentially. During the positive edge of the system clock, if 'dac_start', 'dac_cs' and 'tick' signals are high, it loads command data 'cmd', 'data_in' into the shift register, appending two zero bits at the end for synchronization. However, if only the 'tick' signal is high, it performs a right shift operation by removing the least significant bit and zero padding from the left."
