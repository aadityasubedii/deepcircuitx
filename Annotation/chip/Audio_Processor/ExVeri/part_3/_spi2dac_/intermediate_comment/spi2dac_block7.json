    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the start signal ('dac_start') for a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) based on the state of a state machine ('sr_state'). The block uses a combinational always block to trigger a response at any change in the state machine. In the 'IDLE' and 'WAIT_CSB_HIGH' states, as well as in any unspecified state (default), the DAC is not started ('dac_start' = 0). However, in the 'WAIT_CSB_FALL' state, the DAC is initiated ('dac_start' = 1)."
