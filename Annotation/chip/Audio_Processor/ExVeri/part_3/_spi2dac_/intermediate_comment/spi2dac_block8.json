    "block_comment": "This Verilog block controls the state transitions for an assumed SPI mechanism. This state machine operates based on the system clock's rising edge (`sysclk`). Initially, it's in an 'IDLE' state but transitions to 'WAIT_CSB_FALL' if the load signal is high. In 'WAIT_CSB_FALL' state, it's waiting for the CS (Chip Select) to fall (go to '0'), after which it transitions to 'WAIT_CSB_HIGH'. Here, it waits for CS to rise (go to '1') and then reverts back to the 'IDLE' state. In any unpredictable circumstance, the system defaults back into the 'IDLE' state."
