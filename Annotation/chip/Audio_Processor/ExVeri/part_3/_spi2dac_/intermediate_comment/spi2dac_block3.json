    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes a shift register to a value of zero. Specifically, it uses an 'initial' block, which only executes once at the start of the simulation, to assign a 16-bit binary value of 0 to the shift register variable 'shift_reg'. Hence, it's paving a way to further operations on 'shift_reg' which would be done after this initialization."
