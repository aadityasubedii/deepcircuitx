Comment: 
This block of code oversees a state machine operation. Triggered at the rising edge of the system clock (sysclk), it examines if a 'tick' has occurred. If so, the system enters a case evaluation where the state variable is checked. For the initial state (5'd0), the system moves to the next stage if 'dac_start' is asserted, otherwise, it resets to zero. For state 5'd17, it cycles back to the initial state. For all other cases, the state progresses sequentially.
