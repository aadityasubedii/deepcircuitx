This block serves as a frequency divider which, specifically, generates a 1MHz clock from a system clock (sysclk). The implementation uses a counter ('ctr'), which counts down to zero on every positive edge of the system clock. When the counter hits zero, it gets reloaded with a certain value ('TC'), generates a tick, and inverts the 1MHz clock. Otherwise, on every system clock, it decrements by one and resets the tick. This functionality ensures the clock frequency division. The tick signal serves to indicate the moment when the clock is toggled.
