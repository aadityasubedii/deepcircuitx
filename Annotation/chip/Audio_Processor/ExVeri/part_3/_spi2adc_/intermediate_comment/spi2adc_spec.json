    "spec": "Module name: spi2adc. \n\nModule specification: The 'spi2adc' module is designed for the purpose of establishing SPI communication with an ADC and handling the ADC data transfer process. It operates synchronously with the system clock 'sysclk'. The SPI functionality occurs at a system clock downsampled frequency, realized by an internally generated 1MHz clock. The functionality is triggered by a 'start' signal and allows access to a specific ADC channel defined by the 'channel' input. The data received from the ADC is presented in a parallel format at the 'data_from_adc' output, the validity of which is indicated by the 'data_valid' signal. \n\nThe module utilizes several internal signals. 'ctr' is a 5-bit counter used to generate 'tick' signals and a 1MHz clock necessary for SPI communication. 'adc_cs' is the chip select signal for the ADC and 'tick' denotes the system clock's cycles. States of the SPI transaction control state machine, enabled through 'sr_state', manage the SPI transactions with the ADC. 'reg' is a 9-bit register to store the ADC's data and 'state' is the state of the conversion process. \n\nThe module can be broadly classified into various connected task sections. Firstly, it generates the necessary clocks and control signals for SPI communication. Secondly, it creates a control state machine for managing start/stop of SPI transactions. Thirdly, there's a control state machine for controlling the process of ADC conversion including generation and storage of converted results. All these sections work together to successfully achieve the main functionalities of the 'spi2dac' module.",

                    "text": "Module name: spi2adc. \n\nModule specification: The 'spi2adc' module is designed for the purpose of establishing SPI communication with an ADC and handling the ADC data transfer process. It operates synchronously with the system clock 'sysclk'. The SPI functionality occurs at a system clock downsampled frequency, realized by an internally generated 1MHz clock. The functionality is triggered by a 'start' signal and allows access to a specific ADC channel defined by the 'channel' input. The data received from the ADC is presented in a parallel format at the 'data_from_adc' output, the validity of which is indicated by the 'data_valid' signal. \n\nThe module utilizes several internal signals. 'ctr' is a 5-bit counter used to generate 'tick' signals and a 1MHz clock necessary for SPI communication. 'adc_cs' is the chip select signal for the ADC and 'tick' denotes the system clock's cycles. States of the SPI transaction control state machine, enabled through 'sr_state', manage the SPI transactions with the ADC. 'reg' is a 9-bit register to store the ADC's data and 'state' is the state of the conversion process. \n\nThe module can be broadly classified into various connected task sections. Firstly, it generates the necessary clocks and control signals for SPI communication. Secondly, it creates a control state machine for managing start/stop of SPI transactions. Thirdly, there's a control state machine for controlling the process of ADC conversion including generation and storage of converted results. All these sections work together to successfully achieve the main functionalities of the 'spi2dac' module."
