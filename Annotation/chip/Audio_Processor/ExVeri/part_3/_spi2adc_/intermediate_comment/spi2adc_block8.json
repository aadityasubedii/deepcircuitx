    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for initializing variables in Verilog. Specifically, it sets `sr_state` to the `IDLE` state and `adc_start` to 0 at the beginning of the simulation. The initialization is executed by the keyword `initial`, which implies that the code block is only run once when the simulation starts."
