    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes the digital system at the start of the simulation. Specifically, it sets the default values for several signals: it sets the state to binary 0, adc_cs (Adaptive Data Compression Chip Select) signal to binary 1 to keep the ADC chip deselected at start, adc_done signal to binary 0, indicating that the ADC conversion is not complete, adc_din (ADC digital input) to binary 0, and shift_ena (shift enable signal) to binary 0 to disable shift operation initially."
