    "block_comment": "This block is a state machine that controls the ADC start signal based on the `start` and `adc_cs` inputs. It operates in sync with the positive edge of the `sysclk` signal. The state machine has three states: IDLE, WAIT_CSB_FALL, and WAIT_CSB_HIGH. In the IDLE state, the state machine checks the `start` signal. If `start` is low, it remains in IDLE state. If `start` is high, `adc_start` is set high and moves to the WAIT_CSB_FALL state. In the WAIT_CSB_FALL state, it waits for `adc_cs` to go low and then moves to the WAIT_CSB_HIGH state. In the WAIT_CSB_HIGH state, it waits for `adc_cs` to go high, sets `adc_start` low and returns to the IDLE state. In any unrecognized states, it defaults back to the IDLE state."
