    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a serial to parallel shift register for incoming data from an ADC. The code is executed on the falling edge of the system clock, when the 'adc_cs' signal is active low, the 'shift_ena' signal is enabled, and the 'tick' signal is high. If these conditions are met, the incoming 'sdata_from_adc' is loaded to the LSB of 'shift_reg', while the rest of 'shift_reg' is filled with its former bits shifted one position to the left."
