    "block_comment": "The code block describes a state machine used for setting various control signals based on the state value, operating synchronously with system clock (sysclk). An 'always' block is triggered at every positive edge of system clock. Upon the activation of 'tick' (probably a command signal), it initializes all control signals to zero and increments the current state value. Then, it uses a case statement to set different control signal values for the ADC operation like Chip Select (adc_cs), Input Data (adc_din), Shift Enable (shift_ena), and Done signal (adc_done) based on the state value. It also manages state transitions based on specific conditions. It helps in controlling operations like Single channel or differential mode (SGL), Channel selection, Data input mode (MSBF), shifting of data, completion of ADC reading and resetting the ADC for next operation."
