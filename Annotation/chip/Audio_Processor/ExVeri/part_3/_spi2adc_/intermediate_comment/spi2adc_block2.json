    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a memory storage unit, specifically for data gathered from an ADC unit. It waits for a positive edge trigger on the system clock signal (sysclk), upon which it checks if the ADC has finished its task by verifying the 'adc_done' signal. Once the ADC task has been successfully completed, it assigns the data contained in the shift register (shift_reg) to 'data_from_adc', essentially saving the data from the ADC operation."
