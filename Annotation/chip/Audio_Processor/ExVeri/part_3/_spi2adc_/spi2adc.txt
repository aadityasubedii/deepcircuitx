Module-level comment: The 'spi2adc' module facilitates SPI communication with an ADC, conversion of analog signals into digital formatted data, and manages the states required for this operation. It utilizes various internal signals and state machines to handle SPI transactions, drive necessary control signals, and store ADC conversion results. The module takes a 'start' signal to trigger the process, 'channel' input selects the ADC channel, and a 'sysclk' as the system clock. Outputs include the converted ADC data 'data_from_adc', 'data_valid' flag, and necessary SPI signals. The functionality is realized using a 1MHz clock generation logic, SPI transaction control state machine, and an ADC data conversion state machine.
