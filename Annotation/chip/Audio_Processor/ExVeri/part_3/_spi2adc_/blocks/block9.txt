This block of Verilog code generates a 1MHz clock signal and a tick signal from a higher frequency system clock (sysclk). The block operates by utilizing a counter (ctr) that's reset at every TIME_CONSTANT cycles of the system clock. Upon reset, the 1 MHz clock (clk_1MHz) is toggled and a tick signal is issued if clk_1MHz was previously low. Otherwise, ctr is decremented and tick is set to zero.
