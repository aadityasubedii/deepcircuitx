    "spec": "Module name: ex13_top. \n\nModule specification: The 'ex13_top' module is a top-level hardware design that oversees a 16-bit counter, a Digital-Analog Converter (DAC), and a Pulse Width Modulator (PWM). The module takes a single input port 'CLOCK_50', which serves as the central clock source for the entire system. It offers five output ports, including 'DAC_CS', 'DAC_SDI', 'DAC_LD', 'DAC_SCK', and 'PWM_OUT', which together handle the data conversion from digital to analog and the PWM output. \n\nInternally, the module utilizes a set of signals. 'tick' derived from the main clock and 'load' derived from 'tick' work together to synchronize operations. 'A' is an address signal generated from a 16-bit counter and is used by the Read-Only Memory (ROM) to retrieve data 'D'. There is also a 'reset_count' signal that resets every 1023 clock cycles to maintain the counter within bounds.\n\nIn terms of structure, the module introduces some significant blocks including 'clktick_16' that derives a clock tick from the main clock, 'counter_16' that increments the count up to 16, and 'rom' which uses 'A' as an address to read stored data. The 'spi2dac' passes ROM-produced data 'D' to DAC for conversion, whereas, 'pwm' takes the same 'D' for PWM operation. The complete operation of reading from ROM, converting digital data to analog, and PWM operation is synchronized by the 'load' signal, and resetting of counter is taken care of by 'reset_count'. \n\nThis module can be interpreted as a part of a bigger system possibly designed to generate specified analog signals with the use of a Digital-Analog Converter, the data for which could be generated by a PWM. The module maintains a tight rhythm of operations with the use of 'tick' and 'load', and ensures the smoothness of operations even in the face of increasing system requirements.",

The module is specifying the DAC interface signals like DAC_CS, DAC_SDI, DAC_LD, DAC_SCK and PWM_OUT.
