    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'ex13_top' module integrates a 16-bit counter, a DAC, and a PWM for generation of specific analog signals. It utilizes the 'CLOCK_50' as main clock, and derived 'tick' and 'load' signals for synchronization. It manages digital-to-analog conversions and PWM output through the output ports. A counter, ROM and SPI2DAC support the flow of data ('D'), which is used by both DAC and PWM for respective operations. The process of counting and data retrieval resets every 1023 cycles as governed by 'reset_count'."
