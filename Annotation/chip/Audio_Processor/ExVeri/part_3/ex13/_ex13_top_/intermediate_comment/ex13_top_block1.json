    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing the reset_count logic. It operates synchronously on the rising edge of a 50Hz clock signal. If the variable reset_count matches the fixed value of 1023 (represented as 16-bit binary in the Verilog code), the block resets reset_count back to 1. Otherwise, it defaults reset_count to 0. This functionality of reset_count could be used, for example, to implement periodic resetting or event triggering concepts in the larger system."
