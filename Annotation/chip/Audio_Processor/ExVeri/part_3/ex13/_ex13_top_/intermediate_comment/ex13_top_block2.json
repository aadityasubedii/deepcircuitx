    "block_comment": "This code block initializes the 'reset_count' variable to a single bit binary value of zero. This operation is typically used to return or set the count back to zero during the start of simulation or when the system initiates a reset function. By setting the 'reset_count' variable to zero, it ensures all further operations involving this variable are performed using zero as the foundational value unless modified later in the program logic."
