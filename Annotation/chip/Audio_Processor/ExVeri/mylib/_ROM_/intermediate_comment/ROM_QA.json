The read address is supplied via the \"address\" input while data is fetched and provided via the \"q\" output. The operation is synchronized with the \"clock\" input. There is no write operation performed, hence a ROM. The memory is initialized with a data file specified by \"./rom_data.mif/rom_data.mif\"."

It synchronizes the operations performed by the ALTSYNCRAM module.\n\nOutput port:\n1. q: This is a 10-bit output port that holds the data read from the memory location specified by the address input.\n\nExplanation: The address input is used to indicate the specific location in the ROM from which the data is to be read.
