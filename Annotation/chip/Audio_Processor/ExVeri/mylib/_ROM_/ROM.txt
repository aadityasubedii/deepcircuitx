Module-level comment: The ROM module is a read-only memory implementation using Altera's ALTSYNCRAM component. It fetches 10-bit data from a memory location supplied via the "address" input, in sync with the "clock" input, and outputs the data through the "q" port. Using the internal wire "sub_wire0", the read data is passed to the output. Initialized by "./rom_data.mif/rom_data.mif", the module is designed for a "Cyclone V" device family with a 10 bit address space and 1024 word memory depth.
