Module name: ROM. 

Module specification: The ROM is a read-only memory module that utilizes Altera's ALTSYNCRAM component to define a memory space with a data width of 10 bits and a depth of 1024 words. It uses a clock input for synchronization of operations and an address input to designate the memory location from which data is to be read. The read data is then output through the port "q". Internal to the module, the 10-bit wire, sub_wire0, is connected to the output from the ALTSYNCRAM component, carrying the read data which is then directly provided to the "q" output via another 10-bit wire. The module also includes additional details like the initial data, operational mode as ROM, data width, number of words, and device specifications among others through a defparam block. Offering no write operations, the ROM module operates strictly in a read-only mode. The memory is initialized with a data file specified as "./rom_data.mif/rom_data.mif".
