    "block_comment": "The function of this block in Verilog RTL code is to initialize the 'pre_trigger' register or signal to a binary default value of 0. The implementation detail is minimal and straightforward, with the code running at the start of simulation or when the device is reset, indicating a 1-bit value to 'pre_trigger'. It simply assigns a single bit logic '0' to 'pre_trigger' variable during the initial block execution, preparing the system for future operations. This can imply the system is not in a 'pre-triggered' condition at the start."
