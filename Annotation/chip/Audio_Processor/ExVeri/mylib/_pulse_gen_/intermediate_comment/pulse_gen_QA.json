Explanation: The 'pulse_gen' module generates a pulse when the input 'trigger' transitions from low to high. At every positive edge of the 'clk', the module checks if 'pre_trigger' is low and 'trigger' is high. If this condition holds, 'pulse' is set to high while 'pre_trigger' is also set to high. For other conditions, 'pulse' is set to low and 'pre_trigger' is set to the value of 'trigger'. Thus, this module generates a single cycle pulse whenever there's a rising edge in the 'trigger' signal."
