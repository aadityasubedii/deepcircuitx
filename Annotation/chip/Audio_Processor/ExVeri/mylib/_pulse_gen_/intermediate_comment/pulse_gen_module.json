    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pulse_gen' module generates a single cycle pulse with a positive edge in 'trigger' input, synched with a 'clk' signal. It uses two registers, 'pre_trigger' to track the previous 'trigger' state and 'pulse' for the output. Upon detecting a 'trigger' rising edge at 'clk's positive edge, it sets 'pulse' high for one clock cycle. Otherwise, 'pulse' is set low."
