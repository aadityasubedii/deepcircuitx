Comment: 
This block generates a pulse when a trigger signal transitions from '0' to '1'. The signal 'trigger' is sampled at every positive-edge of the clock, and 'pulse' is set high when 'trigger' rose from '0' (tracked by 'pre_trigger') to '1'. This rising-edge detection reset on the next clock cycle, where 'pulse' is set low. 'pre_trigger' is updated with the current 'trigger' state at every clock cycle, enabling the detection of the next rising-edge.
