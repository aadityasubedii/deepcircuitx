If the 4-bit input 'iW' is between '4'b0000' (decimal 0) and '4'b0100' (decimal 4), the same value is assigned back to the output 'oA'. However, if the input 'iW' is between '4'b0101' (decimal 5) and '4'b1100' (decimal 12), the output 'oA' will be the input value plus 3. For any other inputs, the output 'oA' is assigned with '4'b0000'. The overall function is equivalent to a conditional 4-bit adder where 3 is added to inputs greater than or equal to 5."
