Module name: add3_ge5. 
Module specification: The 'add3_ge5' module in Verilog is designed to perform digital arithmetic operations on a 4-bit input named 'iW'. The functionality of the module can be characterized as a conditional 4-bit adder, where the input 'iW' is conditionally incremented by 3 if it falls within the range of '4'b0101' to '4'b1100' (decimal 5 to 12) and assigned the original value for inputs from '4'b0000' to '4'b0100' (decimal 0 to 4). Outside these ranges, the output is assigned '4'b0000'.

The module has a single 4-bit input port 'iW', which is the input value undergoing the operation. The 4-bit output port 'oA' provides the output of the operation, which is either the same as the input (for 'iW' less than '4'b0101'), 'iW' plus 3 (for 'iW' between '4'b0101' and '4'b1100'), or '4'b0000' (for any other 'iW' inputs).

Internal to the module, no additional wires, registers, or signals are used. The computation is done directly based on the 'iW' input and results assigned to the 'oA' output.

Inside the module, a case statement is employed. It categorizes the input 'iW' into the defined ranges, then performs corresponding calculations, and directly assigns the computed values to the output 'oA'. In the event that 'iW' falls outside the defined range, the default case assigns '4'b0000' to the output 'oA'. Thus, the module effectively serves as a form of conditional adder in digital systems.
