Module-level comment: The hex_to_7seg module is implemented for hexadecimal to 7-segment display conversion. It takes a 4-bit binary input ('in') that represents a hexadecimal digit and returns an equivalent 7-bit binary output ('out') for a 7-segment display. The internal 7-bit register 'out' stores the current equivalent display value. The encoding is achieved within an always block using a case statement, which evaluates the 'in' value and sets the corresponding 'out' value.
