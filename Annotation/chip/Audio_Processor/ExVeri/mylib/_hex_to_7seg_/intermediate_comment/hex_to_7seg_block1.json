    "block_comment": "This block is a combinatorial logic block that converts 4-bit binary input into a 7-bit binary output equivalent. It employs a case statement to process the 4-bit input 'in' and sets the 7-bit output 'out' based on the input value. The case statement covers all 16 possibilities for a 4-bit binary input, each mapped to a unique 7-bit binary output. For instance, if the input 'in' is 4'h0, the output 'out' gets the value 7'b1000000."
