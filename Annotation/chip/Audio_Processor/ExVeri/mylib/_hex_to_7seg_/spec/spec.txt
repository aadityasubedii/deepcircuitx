Module name: hex_to_7seg. 

Module specification: The hex_to_7seg module is a Verilog hardware design block specifically structured to conduct hexadecimal to 7-segment display encoding. The module processes a 4-bit binary input (representing a hexadecimal digit) into a 7-bit binary output, signifying the equated form on a 7-segment display. The hex_to_7seg module possesses two ports: 'in', the input port and 'out', the output port. The 'in' port is a 4-bit wide port purposed to receive a hexadecimal input that the module will translate into a 7-segment display. The 'out' port, on the other hand, is a 7-bit output port, designated to output the 7-segment binary encoding of the input hexadecimal interpretation. Each segment of the 7-segment display is represented by a single bit. Inside the module, there is an internal registered signal, 'out'. It's a 7-bit wide signal utilized to store the ongoing value of the 7-segment display correspondent to the hexadecimal input. This signal's bit pattern is manipulated according to the hexadecimal input to define the required pattern on the 7-segment display. The main block of the code is an always block hosting a case statement, defining the encoding logic for each hexadecimal input to its correspondent 7-segment value.
