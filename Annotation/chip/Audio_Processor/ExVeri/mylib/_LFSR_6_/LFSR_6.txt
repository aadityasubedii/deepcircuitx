Module-level comment: LFSR_6 is a 6-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) that generates a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) upon enable signal 'en'. The module takes two inputs: 'clk' (clock input) and 'en' (enable signal). The internal shift register 'sreg' forms the backbone, initially set to 7'b1. On each rising edge of 'clk', when 'en' is high, it performs an XOR operation between sreg[1] and sreg[6], pushes the result into the least significant bit of 'sreg' and right-shifts the preceding bits. The current state of 'sreg' is mirrored as an output on 'prbs'.
