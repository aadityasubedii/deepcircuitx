The module takes two inputs: 'clk', which represents the system clock and initiates operations on the rising edge, and 'en', acting as an enable signal that allows or prevents the internal operations of the module based on its state (true or false). Internally, the major component of the LFSR_6 system is the 6-bit shift register 'sreg', initially set as 7'b1, functioning as the main tool for generating the PRBS. The state of this register will be reflected as an output on 'prbs' port. Upon each rising edge of the clock signal, if 'en' is true, the module conducts the XOR operation between sreg[1] and sreg[6] and the result pushes into the least significant bit of 'sreg', simultaneously right-shifting the preceding bits of 'sreg'. Lastly, the state of 'sreg' is assigned to the 'prbs', hence generating a Pseudo-Random Binary sequence.",
