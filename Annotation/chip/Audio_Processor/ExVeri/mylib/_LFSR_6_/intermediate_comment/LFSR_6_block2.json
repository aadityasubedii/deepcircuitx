    "block_comment": "This block is a shift register with feedback functionality that's activated on the rising edge of a clock signal. When the enable (en) signal is high, it shifts all bits in 'sreg' one position to the right, with the feedback input being the XOR of the second and seventh bits of 'sreg'."
