Module name: LFSR_7. 

Module specification: 
The LFSR_7 is a module designed to perform the functionality of a 7-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register using exclusive OR logic function for feedback. The module's initial register state is set to 1. It incorporates a clock signal input port called 'clk'. This clock signal acts as a timing reference, triggering an update in the shift register on its positive edge. The updated state of the shift register is channeled through the output port named 'data_out'. Internally, this module uses a temporary storage unit called 'sreg' which is a 7-bit shift register. The contents of the 'sreg' are set to shift on the positive edge of the clock signal, replacing its most significant bit with the XOR of the current 2nd bit and the most significant bit. The 'sreg' further feeds 'data_out' in a continuous loop to reflect its current state. The entire operation is segmented into two main blocks. The 'initial' block sets up the 'sreg' with its starting value, while the 'always' block governs the shift operation and the feedback mechanism.
