It uses an exclusive OR logic function for feedback. The initial seed value for the register is 1. On each rising edge of the clock signal, it shifts the bits in the register to the left and replaces the most significant bit with the XOR of the current 2nd bit and the most significant (7th) bit. The output of the module is the updated state of the 7-bit register."
