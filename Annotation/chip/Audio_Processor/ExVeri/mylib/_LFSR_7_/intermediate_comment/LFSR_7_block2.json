    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) within a digital system. At every positive edge of the clock signal, the block shifts the 7-bit register 'sreg' to the right by one bit. The new bit is computed as the XOR of the second and eighth bits of 'sreg'. This type of bit manipulation is used typically for generating pseudo-random numbers or coding/decoding streams of data.\n"
