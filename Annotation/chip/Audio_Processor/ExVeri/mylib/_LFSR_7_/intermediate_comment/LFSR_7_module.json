    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\"The LFSR_7 module represents a 7-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register, initialized at '1'. It implements a shift operation on a positive clock signal ('clk'), and updates its output ('data_out') via an internal 7-bit register ('sreg'). The most significant bit of 'sreg' is replaced with the XOR of the current 2nd bit and 7th bit at each clock cycle, thus modeling the LFSR's operation.\""
