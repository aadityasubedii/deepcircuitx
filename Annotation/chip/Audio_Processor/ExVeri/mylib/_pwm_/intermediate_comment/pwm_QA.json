The purpose of this module is to generate a PWM signal based on the input 'data_in'. The duty cycle of the PWM signal is determined by the value of 'data_in'. The 'load' signal is used to refresh the 'd' register with the data_in only at the rising edge of the clock when 'load' is high.\n\nOn every rising edge of the clock, the 'count' register increments by one, then it compares the 'count' with 'd'. If 'count' is more than 'd', 'pwm_out' is set to low, otherwise it remains high. As a result, the proportion of the time the 'pwm_out' signal is high (compared to when it is low) changes based on the value of 'data_in', thus generating PWM signal."

It serves as a reference value to determine the pulse width of the PWM output.\n\n- `count`: A 10-bit register which is incremented by one at every rising edge of the clock.
