Module-level comment: The 'pwm' module generates a PWM signal whose duty cycle is determined by 'data_in'. It uses 'clk' for synchronization and 'load' for updating internal 'd' register with 'data_in'. On each 'clk' rising edge, 'count' increments and is compared to 'd'. If 'count' surpasses 'd', 'pwm_out' goes low; otherwise, it stays high. This mechanism modifies the PWM signal's high time proportion, realizing pulse width modulation.
