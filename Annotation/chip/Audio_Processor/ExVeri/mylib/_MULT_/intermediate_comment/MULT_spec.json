    "spec": "Module name: MULT. \n\nModule specification: The MULT module serves as a high-speed multiplier for 10-bit inputs. Its primary function is to multiply a 10-bit input (`dataa`) with a 14-bit constant (`0x2710`) and produce a 24-bit output. The input port is `dataa[9:0]`, which provides the variable multiplicand for the operation. The output port is `result[23:0]`, which is directly connected to an internal wire `sub_wire1`, storing the result of the multiplication. For the internal architecture, the module has two internal wires. `sub_wire0[13:0]` is initialized with a constant value and serves as a fixed multiplier for the module, while `sub_wire1[23:0]` stores the result of the multiplication operation and is directly connected to the module's output. The module employs an `lpm_mult` component (`lpm_mult_component`) for the multiplication operation. The parameters inside the `lpm_mult` component indicate the multiplicand is a 10-bit input, the multiplier is a 14-bit constant, and the product is a 24-bit value. The operations do not reset or require an output carry summation, and they are always enabled. Thus, the MULT module efficiently performs the multiplication operation using a pre-defined constant and delivers the result via a 24-bit output port.",
