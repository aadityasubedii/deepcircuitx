Module-level comment: The `MULT` module operates as a high-speed multiplier, multiplying a 10-bit input `dataa` with the constant `0x2710`. The multiplication operation is implemented using an `lpm_mult` component with parameters set for the fast, unsigned multiplication of a 10-bit input and 14-bit constant, producing a 24-bit result. The resulting output is stored in `sub_wire1` and directly passed to the output port `result`. The operation is designed to not require a reset, carry summation, or clock cycle, thus supporting continuous operation.
