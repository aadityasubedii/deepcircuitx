It takes a main clock (clkin) input and generates a new clock signal (clkout) which is a divided version of the main clock. This division factor is programmable and determined by parameter K. The module uses a counter mechanism that counts down from ((K >> 1) - 1) to 0, and at count 0, it toggles the output clock signal. Therefore, the frequency of the output clock signal depends on the input K. The operation of the clock divider is enabled or disabled by the 'en' signal. If 'en' is high, the clock divider is active, while if 'en' is low, the system stops counting and clkout continues at its current state."
