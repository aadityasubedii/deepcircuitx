    "spec": "Module Name: clkdiv_16.\n\nModule Specification: The clkdiv_16 module is a clock divider that takes an input clock signal (clkin), a 16-bit wide input value (K) to determine the division factor, and an enable signal (en) that controls the functioning of the module. The output of the module (clkout) is a clock signal, whose frequency is a divided version of the input clock signal based on the K value determined by the counter mechanism. \n\nThe module has three input ports: clkin, which is the source clock signal used to trigger operations, K, which determines the frequency division factor, and en, the enable signal regulating the clock division operation. The single output port clkout is the clock signal with a frequency resulting from the division of the input clock signal.\n\nThe module employs two internal register signals: count and clkout. The count is a 16-bit wide signal that counts down from ((K >> 1) - 1) to 0 at the rising edge of the input clock signal when the enable signal 'en' is high. It is reset when this count reaches zero, causing the output clock signal clkout to toggle. The clkout register signal represents the divided output clock signal and toggles every time a zero count is reached in the countdown operation.  \n\nThe Verilog RTL design of the clkdiv_16 module includes an initialization block setting the initial states of count and clkout. A combinational logic block executes at the positive edge of the input clock signal clkin, where the counting operation takes place based on the enable signal status, and the count and clkout registers are updated accordingly.",

It takes a main clock (clkin) input and generates a new clock signal (clkout) which is a divided version of the main clock. This division factor is programmable and determined by parameter K. The module uses a counter mechanism that counts down from ((K >> 1) - 1) to 0, and at count 0, it toggles the output clock signal. Therefore, the frequency of the output clock signal depends on the input K. The operation of the clock divider is enabled or disabled by the 'en' signal. If 'en' is high, the clock divider is active, while if 'en' is low, the system stops counting and clkout continues at its current state."
