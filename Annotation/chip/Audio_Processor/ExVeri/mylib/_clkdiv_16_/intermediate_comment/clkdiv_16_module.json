    "module": "Module-level comment: The clkdiv_16 module is a clock divider that divides the frequency of the incoming clock (clkin) using a programmable division factor (K), furnishing the output as clkout. Enabled by 'en', the divider counts down from ((K >> 1) - 1) to 0 at each rising edge of clkin. On reaching 0, it toggles clkout and reloads the counter with ((K >> 1) - 1). Thus, clkout's frequency is essentially a divided version of clkin. The entire operation is halted when 'en' is low."
