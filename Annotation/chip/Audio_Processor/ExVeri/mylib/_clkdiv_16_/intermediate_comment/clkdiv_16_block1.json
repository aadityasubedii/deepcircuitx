    "block_comment": "This block performs frequency division on the input clock signal `clkin`. It does this by using a counter that increments on each rising edge of the clock signal when the enable signal `en` is high. When the counter reaches zero, it toggles the output clock signal `clkout` and resets the counter to half the value of `K` minus one. If the counter is not zero, it simply decrements the counter by one. This block allows frequency division with a division factor controlled by the value of `K`."
