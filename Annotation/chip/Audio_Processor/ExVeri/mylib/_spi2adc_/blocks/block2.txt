Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for capturing data from an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter). It operates in response to a positive system clock edge, indicating a synchronous design. If the 'adc_done' signal is asserted, implying that the ADC module has finished converting an analog input to digital, the content of 'shift_reg' (possibly the digitized output) is transferred to 'data_from_adc'.
