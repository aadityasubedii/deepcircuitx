    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a shift register for serial-to-parallel data conversion, which is triggered on the falling edge of the system clock. When the `adc_cs` signal is low, the shift enable (`shift_ena`) is high, and a tick signal is received, this activates data shifting mechanism. The least significant bit of shift register `shift_reg` is updated with `sdata_from_adc` while the remaining bits in `shift_reg` shift right by one bit position each."
