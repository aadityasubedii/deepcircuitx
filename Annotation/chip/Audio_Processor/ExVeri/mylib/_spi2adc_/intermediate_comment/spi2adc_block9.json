    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block is designed to generate a 1MHz clock `clk_1MHz` from a system clock `sysclk`. The code takes action on the positive edge of the system clock. If the counter `ctr` is zero, three operations are performed: the counter is reset to a specific time constant, a `tick` signal is generated if `clk_1MHz` is 0, and `clk_1MHz` toggles its state. However, if `ctr` is not zero, it's decremented by 1 and `tick` is set to zero."
