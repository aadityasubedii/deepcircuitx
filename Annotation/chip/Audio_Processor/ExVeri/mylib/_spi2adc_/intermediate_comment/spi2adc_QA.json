The module is designed to handle both the SPI protocol and ADC specifics of data conversion. It acquires a signal, then transfers it to the ADC for conversion. The module then retrieves the digital data produced by ADC and makes it available for further processing. The module controls the timing and synchronization required by SPI protocol and coordinates multi-step ADC sequences. Signal types handled in this module include system clock (sysclk), start signal, data read from the ADC, data validity, data sent to the ADC, among others."

It is used to synchronize the operations with the ADC.\n\n2. ctr: It is a counter used for downscaling the system clock to obtain clk_1MHz. When 'ctr' equals zero, 'clk_1MHz' toggles its state.\n\n3. tick: This signal indicates a toggle in the clk_1MHz. It is '1' when the clk_1MHz signal toggles and '0' otherwise. \n\n4. sr_state: This signal represents the state of the SPI control state machine.

It is used to sequence the initiation and completion of data acquisition and conversion.\n\n5. adc_start: This signal indicates the start of ADC data acquisition. It goes high (1'b1) when the system is in the 'WAIT_CSB_FALL' state and goes low again when the system returns to 'IDLE'.\n\n6. state: This signal represents the state of the ADC data acquisition and conversion process. It sequences the multiple-step of decoding input signals from the SPI, actual data conversion, and digitized output data availability.\n\n7. adc_done: This signal indicates the completion of the ADC conversion.
