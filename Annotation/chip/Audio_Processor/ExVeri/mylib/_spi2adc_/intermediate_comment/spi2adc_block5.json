    "block_comment": "This block of code implements an Analog to digital converter (ADC) state machine. Based on one clock cycle it manages the states of ADC conversion cycle. When the system clock is positive, and tick is on, it passes through various states from 0 to 16, controlling different ADC signals like adc_cs, adc_din, shift_ena, and adc_done. For each state, different input or output signals are generated, setting up the ADC for input and retrieving the digitized results after conversion. It has a default state which is always setting shift_ena to 1. Exception handling for each state is included in case of unexpected input."
