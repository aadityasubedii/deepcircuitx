Module-level comment: The spi2adc module handles communication between a SPI protocol and an ADC. This includes signal acquisition, data conversion and signal retrieval. It uses system clock ('sysclk'), start signal ('start'), and channel selection ('channel') as inputs and sends data to ADC using signals 'sdata_to_adc', 'adc_cs', and 'adc_sck'. It receives converted data 'sdata_from_adc' from ADC and indicates its validity through 'data_valid'. The module operates by a SPI state machine and an ADC controller, using 1MHz clock derived internally. Temporary data storage occurs in 'shift_reg' before it is finalized in 'data_from_adc'.
