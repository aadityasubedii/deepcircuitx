Module name: spi2adc. 

Module specification: The spi2adc module is a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) system specifically designed to communicate with an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). It acquires data signals, manages their transfer to the ADC for conversion, and retrieves the digital output produced by the ADC. The input ports include the 'sysclk' (system clock), 'start' (start signal), 'channel' (channel selection), and 'sdata_from_adc' (ADC output). The output ports include 'data_from_adc' (10-bit digital signal), 'data_valid' (data validity signal), 'sdata_to_adc' (data sent to ADC), 'adc_cs' (chip select signal for the ADC), and 'adc_sck' (clock signal for the ADC).

Internally, several signals are used to manage the operation of the module. These include 'clk_1MHz' (1MHz clock), 'ctr' (counter), 'tick' (toggle indicator), 'sr_state' (SPI state), 'adc_start' (ADC start), 'state' (state of data conversion process), 'adc_done' (conversion completion), 'adc_din' (commands/settings for ADC), 'shift_ena' (shifting controller), and 'shift_reg' (shift register for ADC data). 

The main blocks of code within the module include: initialization of signals, a clock divider to generate 'clk_1MHz', a SPI control state machine ('sr_state') to handle communication with ADC, and a data conversion sequence controller ('state') allowing timed progression through steps of inputs/outputs data conversion. Additionally, there's a section for shifting the incoming data into 'shift_reg' for temporary storage before it is output.

All of these components work jointly, ensuring accurate data acquisition and digital conversion, as per the SPI protocol and requirements of the specific ADC.
