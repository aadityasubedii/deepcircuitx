    "block_comment": "The block is a clock-enabled down counter with a defined constant K, resetting at zero and generating a tick. Triggered at the rising edge of the input clock, the block checks if the enable flag 'en' is high. If true, it checks the current count value. If it\u2019s zero, it triggers a 'tick' and resets the count to K-1. Otherwise, it decrements 'count' by one and clears 'tick'."
