    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\n\"The clktick_16 module acts a count-down clock with prescaling. It accepts clock ('clkin'), enable ('en'), and countdown ('K') inputs, then conditionally decrements 'count' each cycle, based on 'en'. Upon reaching a zero count, it generates a 'tick' output signifying countdown completion, resetting 'count' to 'K' for the next countdown. This is achieved with gated clocking and internal register implementation, providing parameterizable 'N_BIT' functionality.\""
