    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes the state of a system. It is implemented by defining the initial states of clk_1MHz, ctr, and tick variables. Specifically, clk_1MHz is set to 0 (representing the idle state of a 1MHz clock signal), ctr is set to an initial value of 0 across 5-bit width (a likely counter), and tick, another binary signal, is initialized to 0 (suggesting a reset or inactive state of some operation)."
