    "block_comment": "The block is a combinational logic block that controls the \"dac_start\" signal based on the current state of \"sr_state\". The block employs a multiplexer-like structure implemented through an always block and a case statement in Verilog. The \"dac_start\" assumes a binary value of '0' during IDLE and WAIT_CSB_HIGH states but shifts to a binary value of '1' during the WAIT_CSB_FALL state. In any other state (handled by the \"default\" case), the \"dac_start\" signal remains at a binary value of '0'."
