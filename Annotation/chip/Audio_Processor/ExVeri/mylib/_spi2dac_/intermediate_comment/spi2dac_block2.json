    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the transmission of information over a system bus during a defined clock edge. Specifically, when the system clock triggers, a data and command are loaded into a shift register if the 'dac_start', 'dac_cs', and 'tick' flags are all activated. However, if only 'tick' is activated, the block performs a single bit shift to the right, filling the new leftmost bit with zeros and discarding the rightmost bit."
