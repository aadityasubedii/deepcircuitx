    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a 1MHz clock signal from a system clock (sysclk) and provides a 'tick' at every rising edge of the 1MHz clock. It is designed as a down-counter that is triggered on the rising edge of sysclk. At the start, the counter (ctr) is set to a terminal count (TC). The 1MHz clock (clk_1MHz) is then complemented, and if it is low, 'tick' is set high. If the counter is not zero, it is decremented by one, and 'tick' is set low."
