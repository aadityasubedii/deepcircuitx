    "block_comment": "This block of code is a state machine for DAC (digital-to-analog converter) operation. It gets activated whenever there is a rising edge on the system clock (sysclk) and if the 'tick' is high. The state of the machine increases from '0' to '17' when the DAC starts (when dac_start is '1'). After reaching the state '17', it moves back to the initial state '0'. If DAC does not start, it remains at state '0'. The default case ensures that the state machine will always increment its state by 1 with every clock cycle if none of the specified states ('0' or '17') are currently active."
