    "module": "Module-level comment: The spi2dac module is a digital-to-analog conversion module leveraging SPI protocol. It receives digital input ('data_in'), a system clock ('sysclk'), and a loading signal ('load') to orchestrate DAC operations. It generates important control signals: 'dac_cs' for chip selection, 'dac_sdi' for data, 'dac_sck' for clock, and 'dac_ld' for loading. The operation is governed by two finite state machines and a shift register. One state machine decides the start of DAC operation, while the other ensures proper timing of DAC output signals. The shift register holds and processes data for DAC transmission."
