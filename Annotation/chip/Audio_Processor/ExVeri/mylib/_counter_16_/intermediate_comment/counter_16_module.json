    "module": "Module-level comment: The `counter_16` module is a 16-bit synchronous up counter in Verilog. It increments `count` on the positive edge of `clock` when `enable` is high and resets `count` to 0 when `reset` is high. The `count` serves as both an internal state register and output port. There is an initialization block for `count`, and an `always` block handles clock-controlled operations based on `enable` and `reset` statuses."
