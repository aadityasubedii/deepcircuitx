    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a counter module in synchronous logic design. The counter increments on each positive edge of the clock signal if the enable signal is active, ensuring that counting occurs only when necessary. If a reset signal is received, the counter is reset to zero, providing a way to reset the count quickly."
