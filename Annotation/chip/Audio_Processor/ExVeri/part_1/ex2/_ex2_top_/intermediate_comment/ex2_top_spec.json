The role of this module, ex2_top, is routing the inputs and outputs for the sub-module, essentially facilitating conversion from hexadecimal code to a 7-segment display format.

This is a 7-bit output port which provides output compatible with a 7-segment display. The output is generated by the hex_to_7seg sub-module which converts the hexadecimal input into a 7-segment display compatible signal.\n\nThis module does not have any internal signals or registers. All the signals are input and output ports directly connected to the sub-module. \n\nThe code for this module primarily includes the instantiation of hex_to_7seg sub-module and the routing of inputs to this module SW, and outputs from it, HEX0.
