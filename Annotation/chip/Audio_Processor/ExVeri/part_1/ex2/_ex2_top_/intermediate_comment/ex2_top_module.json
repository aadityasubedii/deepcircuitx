This top-level module orchestrates the conversion of 4-bit hexadecimal input (SW) to 7-bit output suitable for a 7-segment display (HEX0). It simply routes the input and output ports to the hex_to_7seg sub-module, which performs the actual conversion. The module, hence, doesn't have any internal signals or registers.\n```"
