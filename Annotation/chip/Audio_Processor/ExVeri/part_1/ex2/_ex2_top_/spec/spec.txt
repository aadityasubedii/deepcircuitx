Module name: ex2_top. 

Module specification: The ex2_top is a top-level module which directs the operations of an underlying functional unit, the hex_to_7seg sub-module. The role of this module, ex2_top, is routing the inputs and outputs for the sub-module, essentially facilitating conversion from hexadecimal code to a 7-segment display format. The ex2_top module includes two ports, defined as follows:

Input port: SW. This is a 4-bit input port which takes hexadecimal inputs, which are then passed to the internal hex_to_7seg sub-module for conversion. 

Output port: HEX0. This is a 7-bit output port which provides output compatible with a 7-segment display. The output is generated by the hex_to_7seg sub-module which converts the hexadecimal input into a 7-segment display compatible signal.

This module does not have any internal signals or registers. All the signals are input and output ports directly connected to the sub-module. 

The code for this module primarily includes the instantiation of hex_to_7seg sub-module and the routing of inputs to this module SW, and outputs from it, HEX0. Consequently, the working of this top-level module is critically dependent on the correct operation of the underlying hex_to_7seg sub-module.
