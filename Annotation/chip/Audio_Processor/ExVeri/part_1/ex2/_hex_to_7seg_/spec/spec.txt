Module name: hex_to_7seg.

Module specification: The hex_to_7seg module in Verilog is designed to convert a 4-bit hexadecimal input into a 7-bit output capable of configuring a 7-segment display. The module takes a hexadecimal value from 0 to 15 ('h0 to 'hf) as input from the 4-bit input port, 'in', and translates it into a 7-bit pattern by assigning it to the output port, 'out'. For each distinct 4-bit 'in' value, a corresponding 7-bit 'out' value is assigned that can illuminate the correct segments on a 7-segment display to represent the given hexadecimal digit. 'out' also serves as an internal register to this module. When 'in' changes, the logic at 'always @ (*)' block responds by assigning the 'out' register with the updated 7-bit pattern based on the 4-bit hexadecimal input. This way, this register constantly reflects the current state of the 7-segment display. The module is neatly organized and robust, providing an efficient means of converting hexadecimal values into their 7-segment display equivalents without any additional external hardware.
