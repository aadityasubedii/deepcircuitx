    "block_comment": "This block serves as a decoder translating a 4-bit binary input to a 7-bit output, commonly utilized for 7-segment display applications. The \"always @ (*)\" Verilog statement means that the block will run continuously whenever an input \"in\" changes. Then the case statement maps each possible 4-bit input value ('h0 to 'hf) to a specific 7-bit output value, respectively, thus realizing the logical conversion from 4-bit input to 7-bit output patterns for the purpose of display mapping."
