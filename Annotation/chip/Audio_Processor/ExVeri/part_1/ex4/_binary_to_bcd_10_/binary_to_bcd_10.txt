Module-level comment: The 'binary_to_bcd_10' module is designed to perform conversion of 10-bit binary inputs into BCD format. It accepts a binary input 'B' and returns four 4-bit BCD outputs ('BCD_0' to 'BCD_3'). Conversion is achieved via calculation and assignment operations using intermediate signals ('w' and 'a' series). These signals are generated from instances of the 'add3_ge5' module, and systematically processed to derive the final BCD outputs.
