    "spec": "Module name: binary_to_bcd_10. \n\nModule specification: \nThe 'binary_to_bcd_10' module facilitates the conversion of binary inputs into Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD), a necessary operation in various digital systems. The input portal 'B' is a 10-bit binary figure that the module then reformats into BCD notation through a series of calculations. These output results are displayed through four output ports namely 'BCD_0', 'BCD_1', 'BCD_2', and 'BCD_3', where 'BCD_0' represents the least significant digit and 'BCD_3' signifies the most significant digit. \n\nThe conversion process is executed via intermediate internal signals, 'w1' to 'w12' and 'a1' to 'a12'. The 'w' signals serve as transitional variables, facilitating the computations necessary for the transformation process, while the 'a' signals store outputs from the 'add3_ge5' module. The functionality of 'add3_ge5' module is not explicitly defined in the initial code; however, it evidently plays a fundamental role in computing the BCD values. The association and utilization of these internal signals map out the systematic transformation of a binary input into its BCD equivalent.\n\nThe code is separated into different sections, each distinguished by their specific functions. Firstly, the instances of 'add3_ge5' module are defined. Following this, assignment operations are utilized to compute intermediate signals ('w' signals), marking the next structural division of the code. In the final part of the code, the computed BCD outputs are assigned to their respective output variables ('BCD_0' to 'BCD_3').\n\nOverall, the 'binary_to_bcd_10' module provides an efficient and systematic process for converting 10-bit binary inputs into BCD outputs.",
