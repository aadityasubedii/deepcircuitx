Module name: ex4_top. Module specification: The ex4_top module is a Binary to Hexadecimal converter designed for a 10-bit binary to 4-digit hexadecimal display conversion. It takes a 10-bit binary input from switches (SW) and converts this binary into a Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) output which is then further represented as a hexadecimal display. This whole operation is divided into different sections: binary to BCD conversion, and BCD to hexadecimal representation for display. Internally, the module utilizes 4-bit buses named BCD_0, BCD_1, BCD_2, BCD_3 to hold the BCD representation of the binary input. These BCD values are then represented in the hexadecimal form in four 7-bit output buses termed HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, and HEX3. Each of these HEX buses contains the 7-segment hexadecimal representation of a single digit from the converted BCD. HEX0 represents the least significant digit, and HEX3 represents the most significant digit.
