Module-level comment: The ex4_top module is responsible for converting a 10-bit binary input (from switches SW) to a 4-digit hexadecimal display (HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, HEX3). The conversion process is divided into two steps: binary-to-BCD conversion, handled by a binary_to_bcd_10 block which outputs four BCD values (BCD_0 to BCD_3); and BCD-to-hexadecimal conversion, implemented in the hex_to_7seg blocks, which translate each BCD value into a digit for the 7-segment hexadecimal display.
