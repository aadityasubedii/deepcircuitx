This is facilitated by instantiating the 'hex_to_7seg' module three times. Specifically, HEX0 takes the 4 least significant bits (SW[3:0]), HEX1 takes the next 4 bits (SW[7:4]), and HEX2 takes the 2 most significant bits (SW[9:8]) of the switch input respectively for conversion into their 7-segment display equivalent."
