Module name: ex3_top. 

Module specification: The 'ex3_top' module is a top-level module that takes a 10-bit input from switches (SW[9:0]) and drives three different 7-segment display outputs: HEX0, HEX1, and HEX2. These outputs are driven by instantiating the 'hex_to_7seg' sub-module for each 7-segment display output. The 10-bit input from the switch is divided into three parts - the 4 least significant bits (SW[3:0]) for HEX0, the next 4 bits (SW[7:4]) for HEX1, and the 2 most significant bits (SW[9:8]) for HEX2. Each part is fed into its corresponding 'hex_to_7seg' instance (SEG0, SEG1, and SEG2 respectively) which converts the binary inputs into their respective 7-segment display outputs. The HEX0, HEX1, and HEX2 outputs are the 7-segment representations of the 4-bit chunks from the switch inputs. This module relies heavily on the 'hex_to_7seg' module for the switch to 7-segment conversion functionality. It primarily serves as a top-level wrapper that inputs the switch data and drives the 7-segment display.
