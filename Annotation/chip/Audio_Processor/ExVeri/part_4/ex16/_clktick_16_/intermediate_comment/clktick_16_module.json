    "module": "Module-level comment: The clktick_16 module generates a clock tick and manages a countdown controlled by 'count' register. Upon high 'enable', countdown decreases at each 'clkin' rising edge. When 'count' is zero, 'tick' goes high indicating end of countdown and 'count' reloads with 'N'. If not, 'tick' stays low and 'count' decreases by 1. All changes happen synchronously at 'clkin' cycle."
