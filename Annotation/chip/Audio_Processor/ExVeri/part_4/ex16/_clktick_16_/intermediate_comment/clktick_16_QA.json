Explanation: The purpose of this module is to generate a clock tick and a countdown managed by the 'count' register. The clock tick event (signaled by 'tick' becoming 1) occurs when 'count' reaches zero. Once 'count' reaches zero, it is reloaded with the value 'N' and starts counting down again. The countdown and tick generation only happen when 'enable' is active (1'b1). The countdown decreases by 1 at each rising edge of 'clkin'. The 'tick' output is high (1'b1) when 'count' hits zero and low (1'b0) otherwise."
