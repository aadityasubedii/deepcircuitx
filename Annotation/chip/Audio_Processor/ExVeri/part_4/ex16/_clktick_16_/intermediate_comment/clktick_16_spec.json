    "spec": "Module name: clktick_16.\nModule specification: The clktick_16 module is designed to generate a clock tick and manage a countdown using an internal 'count' register. Its operation is controlled by three input ports: 'clkin', 'enable' and 'N'. 'clkin' is the master clock input to the module which provides timing, 'enable' is a control signal that when set high (1'b1) activates the countdown and tick generation, and 'N' is a binary value used to reload 'count' each time it reaches zero. The output of the module is a 'tick' signal, which goes high for one 'clkin' cycle when 'count' reaches zero under an active 'enable'. Internally, a signal 'count' represented by an N_BIT width register plays the role of a countdown timer, and a signal 'tick', a single-bit register, serves as an end-of-countdown indicator. The code majorly consists of two blocks inside a clocked always block: the first block executes when 'count' reaches zero, resetting 'count' and setting 'tick' high, and the second block executes otherwise, decrementing 'count' and keeping 'tick' low. The module employs synchronous design principles, with all operations occurring at rising edges of the 'clkin'.",
