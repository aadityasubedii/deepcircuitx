    "block_comment": "This Verilog module is a digital countdown timer. It gets decremented every rising edge of the clock signal 'clkin' when the 'enable' signal is high. If the countdown 'count' reaches zero, it is reset to a predefined value 'N' and a 'tick' signal is asserted. Otherwise, the timer continues to count down and 'tick' is deasserted."
