Internal Signals: w1 to w35 and a1 to a35. \n\n   Explanation: The internal signals are in two categories, 'w' and 'a'. These signals are interconnected and they contribute to the conversion of the binary input to the BCD output values. Usually, 'w' signals are intermediate outputs while 'a' signals are used for intermediate computations. \n\n   For example, 'w' signals are assigned values based on 'a' signals and the binary input. For instance, 'w1' is assigned as `{1'b0,B[15:13]}` where `1'b0` is the least significant bit, and `B[15:13]` are the 3 most significant bits of the 'B' input. Therefore, the connection among the 'w' and 'a' signals, 'B' input, and the add3_ge5 modules, leads to the computation and conversion of the binary input to BCD output values.\n   \n2. 'a' signals are also 4-bit vectors, same as 'w' signals, but they are outputs of the add3_ge5 modules. For example, 'a1' is the output of module A1, 'a2' is the output of module A2, and so on. These 'a' signals are used in conjunction with 'w' signals to compute the BCD outputs. For instance, `BCD_0` is assigned as `{a35[2:0],B[0]}`, where `a35[2:0]` are the 3 most significant bits of 'a35' and `B[0]` is the least significant bit of the 'B' input. Therefore, all the 'a' and 'w' signals contribute to the computation and conversion to BCD output.\n\nTo sum up, these internal signals are vital links for the computation in this binary to BCD conversion process."
