    "module": "Module-level comment: The bin2bcd_16 module converts a 16-bit binary input (B) to its BCD equivalent, output through BCD_0 to BCD_4. The conversion process utilizes a series of 'a' and 'w' internal signals and multiple add3_ge5 instances to carry out iterative additions and conversions. This module performs its binary to BCD conversion through a well-organized and interlinked flow involving careful signal assignments and transformations."
