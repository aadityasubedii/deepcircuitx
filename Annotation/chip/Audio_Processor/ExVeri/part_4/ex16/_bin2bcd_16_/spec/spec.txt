Module name: bin2bcd_16.

Module specification: The bin2bcd_16 module is a Verilog hardware design that takes a given 16-bit binary value and converts it into its equivalent Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) representation. 

The module consists of one input, B, which is a 16-bit binary value. The outputs are BCD_0, BCD_1, BCD_2, BCD_3, and BCD_4 each being a 4-bit value signifying the BCD equivalent of the binary input. The BCD_4 being the most significant digit and BCD_0 being the least significant.

Internal signals used are categorized into 'w' and 'a' signals. 'w' signals are an intermediate computed values based on input B and 'a', while the 'a' signals are outputs from the add3_ge5 components used for further computation. 

The module code is mainly divided into three sections. First, there are declarations of input, output ports, and internal signals. The second section involves instantiation of add3_ge5 instances from A1 to A35, which carry out the necessary conversions from binary to BCD. The third section of the code dedicates to the assignment of internal signals and outputs, which illustrate the algorithm for converting binary to BCD. 

In conclusion, the bin2bcd_16 module shows complex and sophisticated interaction between different signals, computations, and conversion processes in order to convert a 16-bit binary input into BCD outputs systematically.
