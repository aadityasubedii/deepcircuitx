Comment: 
This block of code is used to control a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The DAC is interfaced through the Serial Clock (SCK) and Serial Data Input (SDI) lines, which are assigned within this block. Specifically, the Serial Clock line, `dac_sck`, is driven by the inverted 1MHz clock (`clk_1MHz`) and a chip select signal (`dac_cs`). The Serial Data Input line, `dac_sdi`, is determined by the highest (16th) bit of the `shift_reg` shift register, allowing serialized data input to the DAC.
