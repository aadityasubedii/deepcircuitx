    "module": "Module-level comment: spi2dac strives to manage DAC-compatible data transformation from inputs to SPI sequences, specifically for an SPI-slave device (e.g., DAC). It leverages input ports: clk, data_in, load, as well as output ports: dac_sdi, dac_cs, dac_sck, dac_ld. The module exhibits an internal state machine driven by downsampling the clock signal to 1MHz and employs control signals (load, dac_start) to transition between states. Further, it employs a shift register for holding the SPI sequence to achieve serial data transmission. The module ensures reliable SPI-DAC communication via sophisticated state and data sequence control."
