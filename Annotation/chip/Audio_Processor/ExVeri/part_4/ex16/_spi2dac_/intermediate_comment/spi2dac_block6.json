    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code describes a state machine that controls the state transitions for a data acquisition (DAC) system in a synchronous manner. The code operates on the rising edge of the clock. Initial state is IDLE, from which it proceeds to the WAIT_CSB_FALL state if `load` is high. Concurrently, `dac_start` is set to high. In this state, if `dac_cs` is high then the state persists, otherwise it transitions to the WAIT_CSB_HIGH state. In the WAIT_CSB_HIGH state, the code continues polling until `dac_cs` goes high again, transitioning back to IDLE state and resetting `dac_start` to low. If any unforeseen state is encountered, it defaults back to IDLE."
