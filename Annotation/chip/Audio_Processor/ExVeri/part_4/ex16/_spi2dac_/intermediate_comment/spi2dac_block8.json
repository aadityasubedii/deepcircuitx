    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a 1MHz clock from a higher frequency clock. The code gets activated on every rising edge of the system clock (clk). Then it checks whether the counter (ctr) is zero or not. If the counter is zero, it resets the counter to a constant value (TIME_CONSTANT) and toggles the 1MHz clock (clk_1MHz). If the counter is not zero, it decreases the counter by one. Therefore, this block effectively divides the frequency of the incoming clock to create a 1MHz clock through a counter mechanism."
