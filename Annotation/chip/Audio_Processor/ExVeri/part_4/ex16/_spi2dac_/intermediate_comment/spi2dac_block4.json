    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is essentially a state machine that controls a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) based on a 1 MHz clock signal. On every positive edge of the clock, the state is incremented and according to the current state, different actions are executed. When the state is `5'd0`, it checks for the `dac_start` signal. If `dac_start` is not asserted, the state remains `5'd0` and `dac_cs` is asserted. When the state is `5'd16`, it asserts `dac_cs`, de-asserts `dac_ld`, and resets the state to `5'd0`. For all other states, it asserts `dac_cs` and `dac_ld` while the state continues incrementing. This suggests the DAC could be serially loaded and then reset after a fixed amount of states."
