    "block_comment": "The block of code implements a serial in, parallel out (SIPO) shift register that is used to handle data communication. On each positive edge of the 1MHz clock, if the `dac_start` and `dac_cs` signals are high, the 16-bit shift register, `shift_reg`, is loaded with `cmd` and `data_in` input concatenated with two zeroes. In the case when the `dac_start` and `dac_cs` signals are not both high, the shift register shifts its content by one bit to the right, inserting a zero at the most significant bit, effectively pushing out the least significant bit."
