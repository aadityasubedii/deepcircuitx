Module-level comment: This 'pwm' module generates a PWM signal whose width varies with 'data_in'. Driven by a 'clk' input, it uses a load trigger to assign 'data_in' to 'd'. An internal 'count' increments each clock cycle and is compared with 'd' to toggle 'pwm_out', thus realizing the desired PWM output. A high 'pwm_out' represents a 'count' within 'd', and a low represents an exceeded 'd'.
