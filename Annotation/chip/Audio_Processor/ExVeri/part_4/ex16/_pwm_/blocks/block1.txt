This block of code works as a simple implementation of a pulse-width modulation (PWM) generator. The block increments a counter on every positive edge of the clock. If the counter exceeds parameter 'd', the PWM output is set low (0) whereas, if the counter remains less or equal to 'd', the PWM output is set high (1).
