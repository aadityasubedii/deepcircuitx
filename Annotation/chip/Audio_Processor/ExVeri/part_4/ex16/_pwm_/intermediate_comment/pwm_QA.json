The width of the pulse is proportional to the value of 'data_in'. The pwm_out output changes state either at the beginning of each period (high) or when 'count' exceeds 'd' (low). If 'load' is high at a clock edge, 'data_in' is loaded into 'd'. The 'count' value is incremented at each posedge of the clock, and once the 'count' is greater than 'data_in', it sets 'pwm_out' to 0. So the resulting pulse's width, relative to the clock period, signifies the 'data_in' value. This is a common technique used for digital to analog conversion."
