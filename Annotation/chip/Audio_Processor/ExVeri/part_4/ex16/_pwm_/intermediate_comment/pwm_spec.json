    "spec": "Module name: pwm. \n\nModule specification: The 'pwm' module is a design piece in Verilog that generates a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal, a square wave with its width varying according to the value of the input signal 'data_in'. The module uses a rising edge triggered synchronous design driven by a clock signal 'clk'. It has three input ports: 'clk', which is the clock signal driving the operations of the module; 'data_in', a 10-bit signal which determines the width of the pulse produced as output; and 'load', which when high, triggers the loading of the value from 'data_in' into an internal signal 'd'. There is one output port, namely 'pwm_out', which outputs a square wave signal, high until the internal 'count' is less or equal to 'd' and low when 'count' exceeds 'd'. Two main internal signals exist: 'd', which holds the input data intended for pulse width, and 'count', a signal incrementing on each clock's positive edge to track clock cycles. The main blocks of the code include an 'always' block that loads 'data_in' into 'd' when 'load' is high, an 'initial' block which initializes the 'count' to zero, and another 'always' block which increments the 'count' and toggles 'pwm_out' driven by the comparison of 'count' and 'd'. This module provides an efficient way to convert digital signals into analog using the PWM technique.",

The width of the pulse is proportional to the value of 'data_in'. The pwm_out output changes state either at the beginning of each period (high) or when 'count' exceeds 'd' (low). If 'load' is high at a clock edge, 'data_in' is loaded into 'd'. The 'count' value is incremented at each posedge of the clock, and once the 'count' is greater than 'data_in', it sets 'pwm_out' to 0. So the resulting pulse's width, relative to the clock period, signifies the 'data_in' value. This is a common technique used for digital to analog conversion."
