Module-level comment: This "add3_ge5" module performs the function of adding 3 to a 4-bit binary input 'w' if its decimal equivalent is >=5, or retains the original 'w' value if <5. The implementation uses a case statement based on 'w', storing the resultant operation in a 4-bit register 'a'. For undefined binary inputs, the output 'a' defaults to 0.
