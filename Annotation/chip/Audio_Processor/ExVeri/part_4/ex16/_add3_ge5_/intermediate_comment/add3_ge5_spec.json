The primary objective of the module is to add 3 to an input 4-bit binary number, 'w', provided its decimal equivalent is greater than or equal to 5. The module maintains the original binary number, 'w', for incoming values less than 5. The value of 'w' serves as a condition for an internal case statement, influencing the output. The module is equipped with one 4-bit input port 'w', representing the incoming binary number, and one output port 'a', a 4-bit binary value representing the result of the operation. Internally, the 4-bit register 'a' acts as both a signal and output port, storing the results of cases based on 'w'. The functionality of the module is majorly comprised of the case statement, directing the module operation based on different values of 'w'. Its boundaries cover binary number representations from 4'b0000 (equivalent to 0 in decimal) to 4'b1100 (corresponds to a decimal value of 12), with an inclusive default clause to handle all the undefined inputs, setting 'a' to 0 for such cases.\n",
