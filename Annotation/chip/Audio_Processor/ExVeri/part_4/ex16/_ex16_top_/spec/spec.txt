Module name: ex16_top.

Module specification: The 'ex16_top' is a top-level module that interfaces multiple peripherals, including a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), a PWM generator, and seven-segment displays for signal processing applications. It utilizes two inputs: 'CLOCK_50', the main clock signal for the system, and 'SW', a 10-bit switch input. It also interfaces with an ADC via the 'ADC_SDO' input for digital output data reading. The module also has multiple output routes including 'HEX0', 'HEX1', 'HEX2' for displaying processed data on seven-segment displays; 'DAC_SDI', 'DAC_SCK', 'DAC_CS', 'DAC_LD' as control signals for the DAC; 'ADC_SDI', 'ADC_SCK', 'ADC_CS' for controlling the ADC; and 'PWM_OUT' for outputting the generated PWM signal. Internally, it harnesses a 10kHz tick signal 'tick_10k' and communicates with the DAC and ADC through common SPI interface signals 'data_in' (10-bit data from ADC), 'data_out' (10-bit data to DAC), and 'data_valid' (valid data from ADC). The module manifests into several blocks for distinctive functionality: generating a clock signal (clktick_16 GEN_10K), controlling the DAC and ADC (spi2dac SPI_DAC, spi2adc SPI_ADC), processing data (processor ALLPASS), and visualizing data on hexadecimal display (hex_to_7seg SEG0, SEG1, and SEG2).
