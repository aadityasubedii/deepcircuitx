The CLOCK_50 and SW signals are inputs while HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, DAC signals (DAC_SDI, DAC_SCK, DAC_CS, DAC_LD), ADC signals (ADC_SDI, ADC_SCK, ADC_CS), ADC_SDO, and PWM_OUT are outputs. It generates a 10k tick signal using 'clktick_16' module and sends & receives data to/from the DAC & ADC via SPI interface, controlled by the 'spi2dac' & 'spi2adc' modules, respectively.
