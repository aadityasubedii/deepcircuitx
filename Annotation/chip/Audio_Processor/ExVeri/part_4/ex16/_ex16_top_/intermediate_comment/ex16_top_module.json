    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'ex16_top' module interfaces peripherals like DAC, ADC, PWM generators, and seven-segment displays for signal processing applications. It uses 'CLOCK_50' and 'SW' for syncing, and 'ADC_SDO' for digital data reading. Outputs include HEX digit displays, DAC and ADC controls, and a PWM signal. Internally, the 'tick_10k' clock signal triggers SPI communication for data reading (ADC), processing, and output (DAC & PWM). The module comprises different sections: a 10kHz clock generator, SPI-DAC and SPI-ADC controllers, a data processor, and hexadecimal digit display units."
