Comment: 
This block of code manages a finite state machine (FSM) with three states: IDLE, IN_HIGH, and WAIT_LOW, and generates a pulse when the input in transitions from '0' to '1'. It operates at every rising edge of the clock signal. Initially, it sets the pulse to '0'. When in the IDLE state, if the input is high, it moves to IN_HIGH state and a pulse is generated. If the input is high in IN_HIGH state, it moves to WAIT_LOW state. In WAIT_LOW state, if the input signal is high, it retains the current state otherwise it transits back to IDLE state. The transition between these states based on the input signal effectively controls the pulse generation.
