It has an input 'in' and clock signal 'clk', and outputs a 'pulse' signal. The states of the system are captured by variables 'IDLE', 'IN_HIGH', and 'WAIT_LOW'. If 'in' signal is high, a pulse is generated and state changes from 'IDLE' to 'IN_HIGH'. If 'in' signal remains high, it goes into 'WAIT_LOW' state to wait for 'in' to go low. If 'in' is low, it returns back to 'IDLE' state. Thus, it generates a pulse for a high 'in' signal."
