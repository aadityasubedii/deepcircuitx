    "module": "Module-level comment: The pulse_gen module is a hardware design in Verilog which detects a rising edge on the 'in' input signal and generates a pulse on the 'pulse' output. It uses a clock signal 'clk' to synchronize operations. Based on the value of 'in', it transitions between 'IDLE', 'IN_HIGH', and 'WAIT_LOW' states. Its internal design utilizes a two-bit 'state' register to track its current state. Operation occurs at the positive edge of 'clk', with pulse and state changes defined in an 'always' block case structure to sequentially follow the input signal transitions."
