    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes a state machine in Verilog, setting its initial state to \"IDLE\". The state machine is a widely used design pattern in hardware programming which allows a device to be aware of its status, and accordingly change its behavior based on its current status and inputs. \"IDLE\" is a typical name for a state indicating that the device is not busy and waiting for instructions to execute. The use of the initial keyword indicates that this assignment will occur once at the beginning, setting the state's default value to \"IDLE\". This helps the state machine to start from a known state."
