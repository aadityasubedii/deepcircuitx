Module name: pulse_gen.

Module specification: The pulse_gen module is a digital pulse generator implemented in Verilog which creates a pulse every time it detects a rising edge on the input signal 'in'. The moduleâ€™s operation is synchronized by the clock signal 'clk'. It has two inputs ('in' and 'clk'), where 'in' is the input signal for which the rising edge is to be detected and 'clk' is the clock signal that drives the timing of the module and the changes in the states. The module has one output ('pulse'), which sends out the pulse every time there is a rising edge on the 'in' signal. Internally, the module utilizes a two-bit 'state' register that records the current state of the module. The states are classified as 'IDLE', 'IN_HIGH', and 'WAIT_LOW', each representing an idle state of the module, the state when a high signal is detected on 'in', and the state when the module is waiting for 'in' to become low respectively. Based on the 'in', the 'state' switches between 'IDLE', 'IN_HIGH', and 'WAIT_LOW'. The module is divided into several blocks including parameter assignment to states, initialization of the state to 'IDLE', and a block that determines the sequence of operation upon a positive edge of the clock signal. In summary, pulse_gen is a pulse generation module designed to generate pulses upon rising edges of a specific input signal.
