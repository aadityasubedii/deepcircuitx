    "module": "Module-level comment: The hex_to_7seg module functions as a hexadecimal to 7-segment display decoder. It receives a 4-bit binary input, interprets it as a hexadecimal digit, and produces a corresponding 7-bit binary output which provides the equivalent 7-segment display representation. The module utilizes an 'always' block and a switch case logic to map hexadecimal inputs to their 7-segment display equivalents. The output pattern is stored in an internal 7-bit register, 'out', which drives the external 'out' port.\n"
