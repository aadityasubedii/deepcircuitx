The module features an input port, 'in', and an output port, 'out'. The 'in' port is a 4-bit wide input port designed to receive a binary number representing a hexadecimal digit ranging from 0 to 15. The 'out' port is a 7-bit wide output, responsible for outputting binary coded representations for 7-segment displays based on the hexadecimal input on the 'in' port. Each bit in 'out' corresponds to one segment of the 7-segment display, from segment 'a' to segment 'g'. The internal 7-bit signal, also named 'out', is used to store the binary representation for each hexadecimal digit and is always updated by the combinational logic found in the 'always' block in response to changes in the 'in' signal. These patterns are then driven through the 'out' port to the 7-segment display.",
