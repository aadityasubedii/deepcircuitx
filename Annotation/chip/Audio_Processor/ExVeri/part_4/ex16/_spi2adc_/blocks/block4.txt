Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for initializing variables. The `initial` block is used in simulation to set the initial state of the variables 'shift_reg' and 'data_from_adc' to be zero. This block of code uses binary notation to set these 10-bit length variables to zero at the start of the simulation.
