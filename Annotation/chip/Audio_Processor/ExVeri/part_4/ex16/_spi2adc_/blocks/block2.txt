Comment: 
This block of code is used for synchronizing data received from an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter). On every positive edge of the 1MHz clock signal, if the ADC has finished its operation (indicated by adc_done), the data from the ADC, held in shift_reg, is assigned to the data_from_adc variable.
