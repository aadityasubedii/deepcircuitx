Comment: 
This block of Verilog code describes a state machine with three states: IDLE, WAIT_CSB_FALL, and WAIT_CSB_HIGH, which is designed to control an ADC operation - specifically, the timing of start signal. Upon every positive edge of a system clock (sysclk), based on current state, certain operation would be performed. If the state machine is in IDLE state and start is not signalled, it stays in IDLE. If start is signalled, it transitions to WAIT_CSB_FALL state and signals the beginning of ADC operation by setting adc_start to 1. In WAIT_CSB_FALL, it waits for adc_cs to fall to low before transitioning to WAIT_CSB_HIGH. On seeing adc_cs is high in WAIT_CSB_HIGH state, it goes back to IDLE and signals the end of ADC operation by resetting adc_start to zero. If no states match, it defaults to IDLE state.
