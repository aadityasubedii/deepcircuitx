This block of Verilog code functions as a frequency divider, specifically designed to downscale a system clock ('sysclk') to a lower frequency (1 MHz). The implementation utilizes a counter ('ctr') which resets to a pre-defined constant ('TIME_CONSTANT') every time it hits zero. At each positive edge of the system clock, the counter either flips the output clock ('clk_1MHz') if the counter equals zero, or it decrements the counter by one.
