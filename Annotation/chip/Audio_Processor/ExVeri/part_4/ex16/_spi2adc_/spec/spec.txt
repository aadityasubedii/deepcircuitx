Module name: spi2adc.

Module specification: 

The spi2adc module serves as an interface between a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), allowing for transmission and control of data between these two systems. The module uses input ports like sysclk for synchronization of operations, start to initiate the analog to digital conversion process, channel for ADC input channel selection, and sdata_from_adc for receiving serial data from ADC. Outputs from the module include data_from_adc, a 10-bit signal containing digital data from ADC conversion, data_valid, indicating when the received data is ready to be consumed, sdata_to_adc, sdata_to_adc, for transmitting serial data to the ADC, adc_cs, the chip select signal, and adc_sck serving as the clock signal for the ADC. 

Internally, the module utilizes signals such as clk_1MHz, generated from the system clock, for driving the ADC operations, ctr, a counter for creating the clk_1MHz, sr_state, a state machine signal for managing ADC start sequence, adc_start triggering the ADC start sequence, state and adc_din for managing the SPI-to-ADC communication, adc_done which signals the completion of ADC conversion, shift_ena for enabling the shifting operation of the shift register, shift_reg, a shift register for capturing the serial data from ADC. 

The module is divided into different blocks: an initial block to handle clk_1MHz and ctr, a state machine block sr_state for the start sequence of ADC, a state machine block state for managing SPI-to-ADC protocol, a block focusing on shifter register operations, and finally three assign statements at the end for adc_sck, sdata_to_adc, and data_valid signals respectively. These blocks cover various tasks from state management and signal generation to data handling and conversion. This enables the module to effectively control data transmission between SPI and ADC, retrieving conversion results from the ADC and signaling when the retrieved data is valid and ready for consumption.
