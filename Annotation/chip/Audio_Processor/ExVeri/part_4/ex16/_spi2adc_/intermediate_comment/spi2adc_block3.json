    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a shift register mechanism in a system which interacts with an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter). The shift register activation occurs on the falling edge of a 1MHz clock signal when two conditions are fulfilled: when adc_cs is low (indicating ADC chip select is enabled), and shift_ena is high (indicating shifting permission). The shifting operation executed here will move the current bits in shift_reg to the left, while discarding the MSB and appending sdata_from_adc to the LSB."
