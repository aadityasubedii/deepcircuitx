    "block_comment": "This block of code controls a state machine for operating an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter). At each positive edge of a one-megahertz clock, the state machine advances to the next state. In its initial state 0, it determines the next state based on the `adc_start` signal. It then sets control signals for ADC operation (`adc_cs`, `adc_din`) and a `shift_ena` signal depending on the state. The machine goes through several states, setting parameters for the ADC (like `SGL`, `channel`, `MSBF`). At state 15, ADC conversion concludes and at state 16, control signal is deactivated and the state machine is reset."
