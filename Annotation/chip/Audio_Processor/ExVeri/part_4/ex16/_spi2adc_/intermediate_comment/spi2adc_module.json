    "module": "Module-level comment: The spi2adc module interfaces between an SPI and ADC, managing data transmission and conversion process initiation. It utilizes input control signals such as sysclk, start, and channel, and outputs the processed digital data from the ADC when valid. Various internal signals and state machines drive different ADC operations, manage SPI-to-ADC protocol, and handle the data register operations. Blocks are focused on clock generation, state machine controls, and shift register operations. Assignment statements finalize the output signals, concluding the transmission process."
