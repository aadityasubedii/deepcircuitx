    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates two signals, the `clk_1MHz` and the `ctr` signal. The `clk_1MHz`, presumably a clock signal operating at 1MHz, is initialized to 0, effectively setting it to an off or low state. The `ctr`, presumably a 5-bit counter, is initialized to 0, meaning that it starts counting from 0."
