The primary function of the module is to transmit data serially to the ADC and receive data from the ADC, with appropriate timing and control signals. The module controls the start of conversion, transmits control bits including start bit, single/differential, D2, D1, D0 and MSBF, and also receives the conversion results from the ADC. The communication process is governed by states and clock signals (a slower clock of 1MHz generated from the system clock). This module also includes signal conversion logic for handling the bidirectional data line between the SPI and the ADC. The received ADC data is stored in a shift register and is sampled when the entire conversion process is done. The module signals data_valid when the received data is ready to be consumed."
