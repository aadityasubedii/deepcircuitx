Module name: delay_ram. 

Module specification: The delay_ram is a Verilog RTL module representing a dual-port Random Access Memory (RAM) by utilizing Altera's memory block called altsyncram. In essence, it provides separate read and write addresses, enables signals, and data input and output for each port. The 'clock' input port dictates the write and read cycles while 'rden' and 'wren' signals control whether the operation is a read or a write, respectively. Data is written onto the RAM at the address specified by 'wraddress' when 'wren' signal is active while data is read from the RAM at the address provided by 'rdaddress' whenever 'rden' is high. Any data to be written is received through the 'data' input port. On the output side, the module includes a single port 'q', a 9-bit output that reflects the data read from the RAM at the specified address when the 'rdaddress' and 'rden' signals are active.

Internally, the module contains a 9-bit sub_wire0 which temporarily stores data read from the altsyncram component. This data is then assigned to the output port 'q', which represents the module's final output.

The module code is divided into sections for defining input/output ports, internal signals, and the instantiation of the Altera altsyncram component. Lastly, the defparam block is used to configure the specifications of the altsyncram component, such as its operating mode, memory size, intended device family, and other critical parameters.
