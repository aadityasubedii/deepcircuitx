Module-level comment: The delay_ram module serves as a dual-port RAM, utilizing Altera's altsyncram. It writes incoming data (from 'data' port) at the address specified by 'wraddress' when 'wren' is active and reads data at 'rdaddress' when 'rden' is active, both on the rising edge of 'clock'. Internally, a sub_wire holds read data, which is then passed to output 'q'. This allows separate access for read and write operations, providing flexible and efficient memory handling.
