    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes a register `rdreq_dff`. The register's function is to store the 'read request' flag value in a digital system, such as a memory management scenario. It uses D flip-flop (indicated by 'dff' in the name) for this purpose, a common hardware structure for temporary value storage in digital systems. The initial value of `rdreq_dff` is set to binary '0', making the default state as 'no read request'."
