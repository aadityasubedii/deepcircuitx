    "block_comment": "This block of code is a clock-based flip-flop that sets the read request based on the state of the full flag and the write request. When the clock edge is up (positive edge), the system checks if both the flag 'full' and 'wrreq' (write request) are set. If both are 1, the read request flip-flop 'rdreq_dff' is set to 1, indicating that a request to read data has been made. If the condition is not met, 'rdreq_dff' is reset to 0."
