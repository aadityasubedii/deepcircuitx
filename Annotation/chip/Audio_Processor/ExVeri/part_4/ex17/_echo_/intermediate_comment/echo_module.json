    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\n// Module processor_echo is a digital signal processing unit, handling a 10-bit data stream for echo effects. Its Fetch, Convert, Adjust, and Recombine implementation uses a FIFO buffer and arithmetic adjustments. The data_in is validated, offset adjusted and queued in FIFO, creating delayed output which is then added to the adjusted signal and forwarded to the output after adding a DAC offset. Writes to FIFO are controlled by wrreq signal and rdreq_dff handles reading from FIFO when full."
