Module-level comment: The 'ex17_top' module establishes SPI communication between an ADC and a DAC, includes a PWM signal generator, and connects to a seven-segment display for output. All operations are synchronized with CLOCK_50. The module utilizes internal signals for data communication and operation control. The functionality is achieved by encapsulating SPI communication, clock ticking, data processing, PWM generation and display control within separate sub-modules ('clktick_16', 'spi2dac', 'spi2adc', 'processor_echo', 'pwm', and 'hex_to_7seg').
