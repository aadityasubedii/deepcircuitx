Module name: ex17_top.

Module specification: The 'ex17_top' module is a top-level design that supports a data communication protocol between an ADC (Analog-Digital Converter) and a DAC (Digital-Analog Converter) using the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocol. It includes a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal generator and connects to a seven-segment display. The operations within the module are synchronized with a CLOCK_50 signal. There are various input ports including a 10-bit SW switch and the ADC_SDO line for digital data from the ADC. The output ports include seven-segment display outputs (HEX0, HEX1, HEX2), the DAC_SDI line delivering digital signals to the DAC, DAC_SCK, DAC_CS, and DAC_LD to control DAC operations, and ADC control signals (ADC_SDI, ADC_SCK, and ADC_CS). The module's final output is given through PWM_OUT. Internal signals like tick_10k, data_in, data_out, data_valid, DAC_SCK, and ADC_SCK are used to control operations and data communication. The module includes different blocks like 'clktick_16' for clock tick generation, 'spi2dac' and 'spi2adc' for SPI communication with DAC and ADC, 'pwm' for PWM generation, 'processor_echo' for processing, and 'hex_to_7seg' for controlling the seven-segment display.
