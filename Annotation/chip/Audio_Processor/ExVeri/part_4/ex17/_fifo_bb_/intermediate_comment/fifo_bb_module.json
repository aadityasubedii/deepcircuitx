    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'fifo' module, governed by an input clock, operates as a temporary storage unit handling data. It writes 10-bit input 'data' upon 'wrreq' and reads data through output 'q' upon 'rdreq'. A 'full' signal indicates buffer status. No internal signals are defined; more specifics would require full code implementation.\n"
