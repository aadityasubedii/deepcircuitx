To achieve this, it utilizes a sub-component 'scfifo'. The module takes a clock signal, data, read request (rdreq) and write request (wrreq) as inputs, and outputs whether the FIFO is full and the output data (q). The capacity, width, and other parameters of the FIFO are specified in the 'defparam' section of 'scfifo_component'. Specific unconnected signals such as 'aclr', 'almost_empty', etc., in the 'scfifo' component indicates optional parameters/features not used in this specific instance."

Explanation: 'clock' is the system clock signal that synchronizes the operations of the FIFO. 'data' is the input data stream to be put into the FIFO; this is a 10-bit wide bus, which suggests the data written to the FIFO is 10 bits wide. 'rdreq' stands for 'read request' and signals when the FIFO should output data. 'wrreq' stands for 'write request' and signals when the FIFO should accept incoming data.\n\nOutput ports: ['full', 'q']. Explanation: 'full' is a signal that indicates when the FIFO's storage capacity is reached, or in other words, when the FIFO is full and cannot accept incoming data. 'q' is the output data from FIFO - it outputs the data that went in first, adhering to a first in, first out principle; this is also a 10-bit wide bus, matching the width of the 'data'."
