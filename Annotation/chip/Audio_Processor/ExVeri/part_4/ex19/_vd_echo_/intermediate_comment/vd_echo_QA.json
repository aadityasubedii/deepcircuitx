The module interfaces with RAM, Pulse Generator and an up-count counter. The incoming data (data_in) is adjusted by an offset (ADC_OFFSET) and this value is used to calculate a new value y. Another offset (DAC_OFFSET) is added to the result before it is output. The offset values are in hexadecimal representation. The switches (sw), system clock (sysclk), data validation (data_valid) are inputs to the system. It's apparent that a read and write operation is happening concurrently on a dual-port RAM. Note that there are several blocks (ram_2port, pulse_gen, counter_13) whose implementation details are not available in this provided information."
