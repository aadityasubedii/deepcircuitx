Module-level comment: The mult_const module multiplies a 9-bit input 'dataa' with a constant hex value (11'h666). It employs two internal wires, 'sub_wire0' (holding the constant operand) and 'sub_wire1' (storing the multiplication result temporarily) and a predefined component 'lpm_mult_component' for performing the multiplication operation. Parameters are defined via 'defparam'. No specific clock cycle is involved due to always enabled clock signal. The resultant 20-bit product is stored in 'result'.
