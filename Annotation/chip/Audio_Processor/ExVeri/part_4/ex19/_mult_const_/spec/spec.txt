Module name: mult_const. 

Module specification: The 'mult_const' module is designed to execute an unsigned multiplication operation using a constant operand and an input operand. The module accepts one 9-bit input 'dataa' and produces a 20-bit output 'result', where 'dataa' is the operand for the multiplication operation that is subjected to a change, and 'result' is the storage for the product of multiplication operation between 'dataa' and a preset constant. The module uses two internal wires. 'sub_wire0', a 11-bit wire providing the constant operand represented by the hexadecimal value '11'h666' for the multiplication operation, and 'sub_wire1', a 20-bit wire acting as temporary storage for the multiplication product before it is assigned to 'result'. The multiplication operation itself is performed by a 'lpm_mult_component', which takes 'dataa' and 'sub_wire0' as input operands. The componentâ€™s parameters are defined through 'defparam', identifying input widths and that the operation is a multiplication. The operation requires no specific clock signal due to a high clock enable signal and a low clock signal.
