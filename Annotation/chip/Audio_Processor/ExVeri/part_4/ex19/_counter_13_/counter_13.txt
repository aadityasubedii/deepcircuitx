Module-level comment: // 'counter_13': A 13-bit binary counter. Increments 'count' on positive 'clock' edge if 'enable' is high, resets 'count' to zero when 'reset' is high. Module includes three inputs, 'clock', 'enable', 'reset', and one output, 'count'. The functionality is embedded within an edge-triggered 'always' block driven by 'clock'. 'reset' and 'enable' provide control over counter operations.
