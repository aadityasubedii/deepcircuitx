    "block_comment": "The provided block of code is a counter module that increments a value on each clock cycle. The implementation uses an `always` block that gets triggered at the rising edge (`posedge`) of a clock signal. When a `reset` signal is detected, the `count` value is reset to zero; otherwise, when an `enable` signal is detected, the `count` value increments by one."
