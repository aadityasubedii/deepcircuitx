    "spec": "Module name: counter_13.\n\nModule specification: The 'counter_13' is a Verilog module representing a 13-bit binary counter. The module main function is to increment an internal counter ('count') every time a positive edge of the clock is detected, given that the 'enable' signal is active (high). However, if the 'reset' signal is active (high), the counter 'count' becomes reset to zero, regardless of the 'enable' signal or the state of the clock. \n\nThe module has three inputs ports: the 'clock', which controls the timing events of progress in the counter; 'enable', which controls if the counter should increment; and 'reset', that when active puts the counter to zero. The module has one output port: the 'count', which gives access to the current internal 13-bit counter value.\n\nAs for internal signals, 'count' is the one and only a 13-bit register storing the count's value, which either increments by one on the positive edges of 'clock' (if 'enable' is high) or resets to zero (if 'reset' is high).\n\nThe code of the module features three sections. An initialization block \"initial count = 0\", which functions to zero the register 'count' on startup. The main logic of the module is encapsulated in the \"always @ (posedge clock)\" block conditioned by the 'reset' and 'enable' control signals. There is also a parameters and ports definition section at the beginning of the module, where the size of the 'count' register and the 'clock', 'enable', 'reset', and 'count' ports are defined. \n\nIn a nutshell, the 'counter_13' module is a basic example of a digitally controlled counter implemented in Verilog for hardware synthesis.",
