Module-level comment: "The 'ram_2port' module aims to provide an interface for a 2-port RAM operation. It comprises input ports for the clock signal, data to write, read and write addresses, and enables both read and write operations. It outputs read data through the 'q' port. However, this code provides no concrete implementation of memory read or write operations, lacks internal signals, and uses tri-state behaviours. Full-fledged functionality of reading and writing data to/from a 2-port RAM needs to be implemented separately."
