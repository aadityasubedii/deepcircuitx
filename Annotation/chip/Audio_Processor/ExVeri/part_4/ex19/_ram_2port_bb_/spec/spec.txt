Module name: ram_2port.

Module specification: The 'ram_2port' is intended to be a design for a 2-port Random Access Memory (RAM) interface, inferred by its name and the provided set of input and output ports, though the code provided does not fully implement this functionality.

The input ports for this module include `clock`, `data`, `rdaddress`, `rden`, `wraddress`, and `wren`. The `clock` signal is used to synchronize operations. The `data` is the input that needs to be written into memory. `rdaddress` represents the address from where data is to be read, enabled by the high (1) signal of `rden` - the read enable signal. `wraddress` signifies the address to write data to, switched on by the high signal of `wren`, the write enable signal. 

There is a single output port, `q`, which stores the data read from memory after a read operation.

The provided Verilog code, however, does not declare any internal signals or distinct operational blocks. The input and output ports are assigned tri-state behaviour (`tri1` or `tri0`), implying their potential use in a larger system which may invoke this module under certain states or conditions. Given the lack of explicit implementation of read/write logic or memory storage, the stated functionalities of these ports are expected but not ensured by the present code. An actual implementation for these operations would require involvement of additional internal signals and registers.
