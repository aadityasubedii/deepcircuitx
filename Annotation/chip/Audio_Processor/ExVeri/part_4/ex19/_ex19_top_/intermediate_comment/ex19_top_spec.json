    "spec": "Module name: ex19_top. \n\nModule specification: The 'ex19_top' module is a top-level entity for a digital synthesis system. It has two input ports and fifteen output ports. The input ports are 'SW', a 9-bit switch input which controls various functionalities of the system, and 'CLOCK_50', a clock input which operates at 50 MHz. The module processes input data and transforms it into outputs which are directed to 7-segment displays and to both Analog and Digital Converters (ADC and DAC). These output ports comprise of 'HEX0' to 'HEX4', which drive respective 7-segment displays, 'DAC_SDI', 'DAC_SCK', 'DAC_CS', and 'DAC_LD' controlling the DAC, and 'ADC_SDI', 'ADC_SCK', and 'ADC_CS' controlling the ADC. Two more output lines are 'ADC_SDO', conveying the serial data output from the ADC, and 'PWM_OUT', providing a Pulse Width Modulation signal.\n\nInternally, the module comprises signals providing connections and data transfers amongst numerous submodules. Signals like 'tick_10k', 'data_in', 'data_out', and 'data_valid' manage data flow and information exchange. 'tick_10k' is a 10kHz clock tick, 'data_in' and 'data_out' are 10-bit signals indicating digitized data from an analog source and processed output data respectively, and 'data_valid' is a control signal indicating when data from ADC is ready for further processing. The output from the 'mult_const' module is denoted by the 'display' signal, with conversion to Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) available through 'BCD0' to 'BCD4'.\n\nThe subsystems in the 'ex19_top' module include clock ticking, digital to analog conversion, analog to digital conversion, pulse width modulation, echo synthesis with variable delay, multiplication, binary to BCD conversion, and hexadecimal to the 7-segment display conversion. This modular structure allows each submodule to perform their distinctive roles independently, making the overall system easier to understand, modify, and scale.",
