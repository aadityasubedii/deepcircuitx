The system is built with multiple submodules which handle tasks such as frequency ticking (clktick_16), digital to analog conversion (SPI_DAC), analog to digital conversion (SPI_ADC), PWM signaling (PWM_DC), echo synthesis with variable delay (echo_synthesizer_variable_delay), multiplication (mult), binary to BCD conversion (bin_to_bcd), and hexadecimal to 7-segment display conversion (hex_to_7seg). The modular design allows each functionality to be implemented separately, which makes the overall system easier to understand and modify. It seems to be set up to process data from an input, control and transform the data flow, and ultimately display the result."
