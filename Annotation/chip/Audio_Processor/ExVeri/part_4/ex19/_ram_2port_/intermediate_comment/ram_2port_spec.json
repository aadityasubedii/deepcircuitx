    "spec": "Module name: ram_2port. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe 'ram_2port' module in Verilog is crucial for the implementation of a dual-port RAM (Random Access Memory) specific to FPGA designs. This module offers independent read and write operations through two separate ports. \n\nThe module has six input ports: 'clock', 'data[8:0]', 'rdaddress[12:0]', 'rden', 'wraddress[12:0]', and 'wren'. The 'clock' synchronizes operations within the module. 'data[8:0]' is a 9-bit input where data to be written into RAM is supplied. 'rdaddress[12:0]' and 'wraddress[12:0]' are 13-bit inputs which provide the addresses for reading and writing data respectively. 'rden' is the read enable signal and 'wren' is the write enable signal, triggering their respective operations when set high.\n\nThe module has one output port: 'q[8:0]', which returns the data read from the RAM.\n\nTwo internal signals, 'sub_wire0[8:0]' and 'q[8:0]', are involved in the operations. 'sub_wire0' connects as the data output from the internal RAM component (altsyncram), then this data is transferred to 'q[8:0]' which serves this to the external world.\n\nThe major sections in the code include the input & output declaration, internal signal declaration, \"altsyncram\" component instantiation and its connectivity, and the \"defparam\" block for parameter configuration. The parameters defined in the \"defparam\" block pertain to the internal \"altsyncram\" configuration, influencing its functionality like operation mode, memory size, and device compatibility. The sole purpose of this module is to offer convenient read and write operations to the RAM, fitting the requirements of a dual-port memory system.",
