Module name: mult_const. Module specification: The 'mult_const' module is a design whose intended functionality is not clearly provided within the given Verilog RTL code. However, based on its name, it might be designed to multiply a 9-bit input 'dataa' with a constant value, but this cannot be confirmed without examining the internal logic. There are two ports defined in the module: an input 'dataa' which is a 9-bit signal that might serve as an operand for multiplication and an output 'result' which is a 20-bit signal that might be designed to store and output the result of the multiplication. There are no blocks or sections in this code as the internal logic has not been provided. Also, no internal signals are defined or used within this module. The specification and operation of this module cannot be fully determined without the internal logic of the module.
