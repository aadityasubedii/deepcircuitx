Explanation: The code above defines a module named mult_const with two ports defined: an input dataa which is a 9-bit data, and an output result which is a 20-bit data. However, the functionality of the module is not present in the code snippet provided. Normally, the logic or intended function of the module, such as mathematical operations, signal processing, etc. would be written inside the module. In this case, based on the module's name, it could be a module used to multiply a constant value, but without the internal logic, this cannot be confirmed."
