    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mult_const' module may perform a multiplication operation with a constant factor \u2013 inferred from its name. It has a 9-bit signal input 'dataa' possibly serving as the operand and a 20-bit output 'result' possibly designed to store and output the multiplication outcome. Implementation details are unavailable, thus error-free functionality and operation can't be guaranteed."
