    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'ex18_top' is a central module coordinating communication between ADC, DAC, a PWM generator, and 7-segment displays. It uses a 50MHz clock ('CLOCK_50') for synchronization. Inputs include clock, switch inputs ('SW'), and ADC Serial Data Output ('ADC_SDO'). Outputs facilitate SPI communication with DAC and ADC, drive 7-segment displays, and carry PWM signals. Internally, it utilizes signals for data handling ('data_in', 'data_out'), validity checking ('data_valid'), clock ticks ('tick_10k'), and SPI clocks ('DAC_SCK', 'ADC_SCK'). Functionality is achieved through sub-modules for clock ticking, SPI communication, PWM generation, data processing, and display driving."
