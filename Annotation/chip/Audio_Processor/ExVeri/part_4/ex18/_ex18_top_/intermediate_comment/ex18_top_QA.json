It also contains a PWM generator that uses the output data of the SPI for DAC communication. Data from the ADC is processed by a processor and then used to drive DAC after operation.

HEX0, HEX1, HEX2: These are 7-bit wide outputs used to drive a 7-segment display. The data to display is derived from ADC\u2019s digital output (data_in).\n2. DAC_SDI, DAC_SCK, DAC_CS, DAC_LD: These are signals used for SPI communication with the Digital to Analog Converter (DAC).

It generates pulses at a frequency of 10kHz. Essentially, it is a downscaled version of the main clock and is used as a start signal for both ADC and DAC operations, and also for PWM generator.\n\n2. data_in: This is another internal 10-bit signal, which represents the digital data sent from the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) to this module. It is also used as input to the 'ECHO' sub-module, which processes the data and generates 'data_out' for driving DAC and PWM generator. Portions of 'data_in' are also used for displaying data on 7-segment displays.\n\n3. data_out: This is a 10-bit wide signal that is the output of the 'ECHO' sub-module. It represents the processed data which is fed into the DAC for conversion back into an analog signal, and also as an input to the PWM generator.\n\n4. data_valid: This internal wire signal represents the status of the validity of the data that comes out of the ADC. It serves as another input to the 'ECHO' sub-module, which can use it to determine if the 'data_in' from the ADC is valid or not.\n\n5. DAC_SCK, ADC_SCK: These signals represent the clock signals used in the SPI communication for the DAC and ADC respectively. They synchronize the operation of the SPI interface for these two components. These signals would commonly be output signals, but in this context, they have been declared as internal wire signals, most likely because they are internally connected within the 'ex18_top' module, but not directly driven by it."
