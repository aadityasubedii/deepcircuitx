    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog updates the value of `data_out` at the positive edge of the system clock (`sysclk`). The updated value of `data_out` is calculated by taking the sum of `y` and `DAC_OFFSET`. The use of the `<=` operator ensures that the update happens at the end of the current simulation timestep, preventing simultaneous read and write conflicts."
