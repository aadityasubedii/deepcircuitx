    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code handles an event that triggers with a positive edge of the system clock. The block works to set a read request flag (`rdreq_dff`) based on the conditions of full memory (`full`) and a write request (`wrreq`). When both `full` and `wrreq` are true (i.e., the memory is full and a write request is active), `rdreq_dff` is set to 1, making a read request. On all other cases, `rdreq_dff` is reset to 0, clearing any read requests."
