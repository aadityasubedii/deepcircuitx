This block performs the operation of subtracting binary echoed values from a given binary value 'x'. This is achieved by the use of 'assign' Verilog keyword to perform the binary subtraction where 'x' is the minuend. The echoed values are extracted from the array 'echo' starting from the 10th element to the 2nd one and joined together with the 10th element to make up the subtrahend. The subtraction result is then assigned to the variable 'y'.
