    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'add3_ge5' module takes a 4-bit binary vector input 'iW' and generates a 4-bit binary vector output 'oA'. The output is determined directly based on input logic. For 'iW' less than 5, 'oA' is left unchanged; for 'iW' equal to or greater than 5, 3 is added to the input to produce 'oA'; for invalid inputs (if 'iW' greater than 12), 'oA' defaults to 0. The functionality is implemented through case blocks within an always block, triggered by any change in 'iW'. The module does not use any internal signals."
