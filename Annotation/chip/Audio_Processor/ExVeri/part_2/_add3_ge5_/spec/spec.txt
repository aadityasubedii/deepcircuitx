Module name: add3_ge5. 

Module specification: The 'add3_ge5' module takes a 4-bit binary vector input 'iW', applies a specific condition-based function and generates a 4-bit binary vector output 'oA'. The module's operation depends on the value of 'iW'. If 'iW' is less than 5, the output 'oA' will be the same as the input. However, if 'iW' is equal to or greater than 5, the module increments 'iW' by 3 to produce 'oA'. This operation remaps input values from the range of 5 to 8 to the output range of 8 to 15. For invalid inputs (if 'iW' is greater than 12), the output 'oA' is set to 0. The module does not include any internal signals or registers, and it executes the operation directly on the input to generate the output. The code is divided into different case blocks that handle the specific conditions applicable for different values of 'iW'. Each case block represents an output value for 'oA' corresponding to an input value of 'iW'.
