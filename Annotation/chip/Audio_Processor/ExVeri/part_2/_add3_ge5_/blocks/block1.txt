Comment: 
The provided block of Verilog code forms a 4-bit Binary to Thermometer Converter. Upon encountering an input binary value (iW), the sequential switch-case structure assigns a corresponding thermometer coded value to the output (oA). For example, an input of '4'b0100 results in '4'b0100 as output, while '4'b0110 leads to '4'b1001. In instances where inputs outside the defined binary range are presented, the default case sets the output as '4'b0000, thereby ensuring the virtue of error resilience.
