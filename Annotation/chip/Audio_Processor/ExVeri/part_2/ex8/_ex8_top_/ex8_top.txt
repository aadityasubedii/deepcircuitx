Module-level comment: The 'ex8_top' module acts as a composed random-interval delay generator-display system. It integrates clock modules ('TICK1' and 'TICK500') for timing, an LFSR for random sequence generation ('RDMGEN'), a state machine ('FSM') for control, a delay function ('DELAY'), and output conversion & display modules ('bin2bcd_16' and 'hex_to_7seg'). User inputs on 'KEY' and the main clock input 'CLOCK_50' initiate the process. The generated random sequence, passed through delay and then converted into BCD, is finally displayed on HEX ports.
