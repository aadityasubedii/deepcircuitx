Based on the submodules and functionality outlined in the code, this design appears to include a series of clocks (`TICK1` and `TICK500`) for timekeeping purposes, a Linear Feedback Shift Register (`RDMGEN`) for random number generation, and a finite-state machine (`FSM`) to control system state based on inputs and time. There is also a delay function (`DELAY`) which seems to execute a delay proportional to a randomly generated value. Lastly, the design includes conversion of the generated numbers into Binary Coded Decimal (`bin2bcd_16`) and then presents those values on a hexadecimal display, possibly an LED display (`hex_to_7seg`). The actual functionality would, however, depend on the definitions and usages of these submodules."

They are connected to the output values of the binary-coded decimal to 7-segment hex display converter modules (`hex_to_7seg`). The specific value on each display is determined by the output of the `bin2bcd_16` module (the binary-to-BCD converter) which takes a pseudo-random binary signal as its input.\n\nInputs and outfits wire:\n1. `TICK_1MS`, `TICK_500MS`: These are generated by two clock modules (`clk_16_tick` and `clk500` respectively) and appear to generate \"ticks\" at one millisecond and 500 millisecond intervals respectively. They're then used by other parts of the design as timing references.\n2. `time_out`: It appears to come from the `DELAY` module and may indicate a delay period's ending.\n3. `en_lfsr`, `start_delay`: These signals come from the finite state machine (`FSM`) module and are used to enable the linear-feedback shift register (`RDMGEN`) and to start the delay (`DELAY`), respectively.\n4. `prbs`, `BCD0`, `BCD1`, `BCD2`, `BCD3`, `BCD4`: The `prbs` seems to be a pseudo-random binary sequence generated by the `RDMGEN` module and it's used to create a delay. The `BCD0` through `BCD4` are binary-coded decimal representations of the `prbs` value, converted via the `bin2bcd_16` module.\n5. `LEDR`: It's used in the `FSM` module and seems to be related to an LED output, possibly for status indication or user feedback.
