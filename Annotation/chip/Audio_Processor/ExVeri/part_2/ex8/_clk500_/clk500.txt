Module-level comment: The module clk500 functions as a 500Hz clock signal generator from a 1GHz input signal. It uses a 9-bit counter ('count') that increments on each positive edge of the 'en' input and resets at decimal 500, simultaneously generating a high 'tick' output for one cycle. Otherwise, a low 'tick' output is maintained. Consequently, the 'tick' output effectively provides a 500Hz clock. This module symbolizes an efficient clock divider by strictly adhering to Verilog's edge-detection strategies and sensitivity list practices.
