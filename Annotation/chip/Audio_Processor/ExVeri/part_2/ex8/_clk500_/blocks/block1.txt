This block of Verilog code is a counter that generates a tick every 500 cycles. At every rising edge of the enable signal (en), it checks if count equals to 500 (9'b111110100 in binary), if so, it sets the tick high and resets the count. Otherwise, it increments the count by one and sets the tick low. The block effectively creates a delay mechanism or a timed-event generator in hardware.
