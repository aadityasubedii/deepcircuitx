    "spec": "Module name: clk500. \n\nModule specification: The clk500 module is a counter-based clock generator that produces a clock signal with a frequency of 500Hz when fed a 1GHz clock signal. The essential functionality of the clk500 module hinges on the incremental count of positive edges of the 'en' input signal. The module resets once the count hits decimal 500 (binary 9'b111110100) and generates a 'tick' output of 1 for one cycle. For all other counts, it sets the 'tick' output to 0, thus, effectively generating a 500Hz clock from a 1GHz input.\n\nThe module employs one input port: 'en'. This is the 1GHz clock signal input that the module operates upon. Further, it uses one output port: 'tick'. This 'tick' output serves essentially as the 1Hz clock signal generated by the module.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes two signals, 'count' and 'tick'. 'Count' is a 9-bit register used as a counter to number the positive edges of the input 'en' signal until 500. Once this mark is hit, it triggers a 'tick' and resets. 'Tick' is another internal register that acts as the 500Hz output clock signal, set to 1 for one cycle when 'count' hits 500, and 0 for all other times. \n\nThe primary block of code within this module is the condition within the always block that checks whether the 'count' has reached 500. In case it has, it resets the count and sets 'tick' to 1; otherwise, it increments 'count' and sets 'tick' to 0. The initial statements define the initial state of the internal registers 'tick' and 'count'. This comprehensive module's design offers an efficient method of achieving clock division, paying close attention to Verilog's sensitivity list conventions and edge detection strategies for appropriate clocking.",
