Module name: fsm_light. 

Module specification: The fsm_light module is a hardware design implemented in Verilog which controls a set of LEDs through a state machine logic. It has input ports including the system clock (clk), a control signal for state transitions (tick), a trigger to move the system out of idle state (trigger), and a control signal to reset the state back to idle from the final state (time_out). It features output signals: a control for Linear Feedback Shift Register, LFSR, (en_lfsr), a control signal to initiate a state-specific delay (start_delay), and a 10-bit vector to manage the LED states (ledr). The module includes internal registers to hold the state of the finite state machine (state), the LFSR (en_lfsr), the control signal to start delay (start_delay), and the LED status (ledr). The module's operation is split into two major blocks: one block which manages state transitions in accordance with the control input signals, and a second block that defines the output registers and their values in response to varying states. Overall, the fsm_light module presents a solid example of a finite state machine driving a sequential light-up pattern on a set of LEDs, with incorporated control signals for supplemental features such as LFSR and state-based delay.
