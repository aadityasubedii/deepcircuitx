    "module": "Module-level comment: The fsm_light module, implemented in Verilog, controls a sequential light-up pattern on 10 LEDs using a finite state machine. It transitions between states based on input control signals 'tick', 'trigger' and 'time_out'. Internal registers like 'state', 'en_lfsr', 'start_delay', and 'ledr' manage the state machine, LFSR control, delay initiation, and LED patterns respectively. The functionality is segregated into two blocks; one governs state transitions based on input signals, and the other dictates output states tied to each FSM state."
