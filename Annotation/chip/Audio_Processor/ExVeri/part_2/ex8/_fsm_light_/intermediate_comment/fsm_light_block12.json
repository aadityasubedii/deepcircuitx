    "block_comment": "This Verilog block implements a finite state machine (FSM) to control a register `ledr` and couple of signals `en_lfsr` and `start_delay` based on current state. The block assigns different binary patterns to `ledr` for each light state (LIGHT0 to LIGHT9), progressively illuminating more LEDs on a 10-LED array. Apart from the idle state, it disables `en_lfsr` thus halting any linear feedback shift operation and controls `start_delay` only in LIGHT9 state. The block uses a sensitivity list at all (`always @ (*)`) implying combinational logic design behavior."
