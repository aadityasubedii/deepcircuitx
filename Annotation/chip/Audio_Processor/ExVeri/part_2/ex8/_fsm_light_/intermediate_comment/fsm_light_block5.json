    "block_comment": "This block of code, labeled LIGHT5, is primarily responsible for LEDs control and handling certain timing signals in circuits. The block instantaneously sets the state of 10 LEDs (where the right-half ten LEDs are intended to be turned off due to the '1111110000' bit pattern denoted) and subsequently disables the en_lfsr and the start_delay signals. These control signals manipulation aids in dictating the overall sequence and state flow of the implemented circuit."
