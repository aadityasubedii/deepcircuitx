The module transitions between different states - idle and various light states, based on the inputs such as 'trigger', 'tick', and 'time_out'. In the idle state, all lights are off. Each light state represents a specific LED pattern where more LEDs are switched on sequentially from LIGHT0 to LIGHT9. At the LIGHT9 state, when 'time_out' is received, it transitions back to the IDLE state, turning off all LEDs. There is also functionality to enable a linear-feedback shift register (lfsr) during the idle state and start a delay at the final light state (LIGHT9)."

It can take up one of the predefined parameter values, representing different states of the LED (from all OFF (IDLE) to all ON (LIGHT9) in a step-wise fashion). Its value determines which case (i.e., state) the module currently operates in.\n2. en_lfsr: This is a 1-bit internal register that controls whether a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is enabled or not. The LFSR is not implemented within this module, but the control signal is generated here. It is enabled when the FSM is in its idle state and disabled when in any of the light states.\n3. start_delay: This is a 1-bit internal register that signals the initiation of a delay when the module reaches the state LIGHT9. The specific function of this delay isn't specified in the module, but its control signal is generated within this module.\n4. ledr: This is a 10-bit internal register that controls 10 LEDs. Each bit of `ledr` corresponds to one LED. The pattern of LEDs that turn ON is determined by the current state of the system, which is represented by the `state` signal. The 'ledr' signal drives the LED output visible on the hardware."
