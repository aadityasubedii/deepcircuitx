    "block_comment": "The block implements a state machine to control lights sequentially based on a trigger and a ticking clock signal. It waits in the IDLE state until a trigger event occurs, then it moves through states LIGHT0-LIGHT9, advancing the state with every rising edge (i.e., 1'b1) of the tick signal. After LIGHT9, if the 'time_out' signal is high, the state machine will return to the IDLE state. The progression through states is controlled by a 'case' structure within a 'always @ (posedge tick)' block, ensuring transitions only occur at the positive clock edge."
