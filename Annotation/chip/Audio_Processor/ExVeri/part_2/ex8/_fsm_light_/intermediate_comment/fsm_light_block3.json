    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code, labeled as LIGHT7, manages the settings of a set of LEDs and two triggers in a system. The block sets the status of ten LEDs, represented by 'ledr', such that only the first two from the right are off while the other eight are on, accomplished by applying a binary value '1111111100'. The block also disables a Linear Feedback Shift Register(lfsr) (en_lfsr) and the start of a delay function (start_delay), both achieved by assigning them a binary value of '0'."
