    "spec": "Module name: fsm_light. \n\nModule specification: The fsm_light module is a hardware design implemented in Verilog which controls a set of LEDs through a state machine logic. It has input ports including the system clock (clk), a control signal for state transitions (tick), a trigger to move the system out of idle state (trigger), and a control signal to reset the state back to idle from the final state (time_out). It features output signals: a control for Linear Feedback Shift Register, LFSR, (en_lfsr), a control signal to initiate a state-specific delay (start_delay), and a 10-bit vector to manage the LED states (ledr). The module includes internal registers to hold the state of the finite state machine (state), the LFSR (en_lfsr), the control signal to start delay (start_delay), and the LED status (ledr). The module's operation is split into two major blocks: one block which manages state transitions in accordance with the control input signals, and a second block that defines the output registers and their values in response to varying states. Overall, the fsm_light module presents a solid example of a finite state machine driving a sequential light-up pattern on a set of LEDs, with incorporated control signals for supplemental features such as LFSR and state-based delay.",

The module transitions between different states - idle and various light states, based on the inputs such as 'trigger', 'tick', and 'time_out'. In the idle state, all lights are off. Each light state represents a specific LED pattern where more LEDs are switched on sequentially from LIGHT0 to LIGHT9. At the LIGHT9 state, when 'time_out' is received, it transitions back to the IDLE state, turning off all LEDs. There is also functionality to enable a linear-feedback shift register (lfsr) during the idle state and start a delay at the final light state (LIGHT9)."

It can take up one of the predefined parameter values, representing different states of the LED (from all OFF (IDLE) to all ON (LIGHT9) in a step-wise fashion).

It has input ports including the system clock (clk), a control signal for state transitions (tick), a trigger to move the system out of idle state (trigger), and a control signal to reset the state back to idle from the final state (time_out). It features output signals: a control for Linear Feedback Shift Register, LFSR, (en_lfsr), a control signal to initiate a state-specific delay (start_delay), and a 10-bit vector to manage the LED states (ledr). The module includes internal registers to hold the state of the finite state machine (state), the LFSR (en_lfsr), the control signal to start delay (start_delay), and the LED status (ledr). The module's operation is split into two major blocks: one block which manages state transitions in accordance with the control input signals, and a second block that defines the output registers and their values in response to varying states. Overall, the fsm_light module presents a solid example of a finite state machine driving a sequential light-up pattern on a set of LEDs, with incorporated control signals for supplemental features such as LFSR and state-based delay."
