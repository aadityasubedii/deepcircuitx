    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to control the operation of a light, specifically `LIGHT0` and to stop a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). The LEDR is set such that only the first light in the series lights up, represented by the 10bit binary sequence '1000000000'. Two additional signals, `en_lfsr` and `start_delay` are also set to zero. This could mean stopping the LFSR and the delay associated with it."
