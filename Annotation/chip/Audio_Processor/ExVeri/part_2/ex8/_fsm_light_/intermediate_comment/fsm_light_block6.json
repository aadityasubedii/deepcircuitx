    "block_comment": "This block of code, labelled LIGHT4, is responsible for activating a specific pattern on a series of 10 LEDs and disabling the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) and the start delay. Specifically, the implementation sets the 5 most significant bits of the 'ledr' register to 1 and the 5 least significant bits to 0, resulting in a pattern where the first five LEDs are turned on and the last five are off. Simultaneously, the 'en_lfsr' and the 'start_delay' signals are both set to 0, effectively disabling the LFSR and the starting delay."
