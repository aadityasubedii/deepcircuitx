The block named "LIGHT8" controls a light-emitting diode (LED) and a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). Specifically, it turns on the first LED (as indicated by 'ledr' being set to binary 1111111110, where 0 signifies an on state); and it disables the LFSR and a start delay mechanism (indicated by 'en_lfsr' and 'start_delay' being set to binary 0).
