Comment: 
The block labeled LIGHT2 is responsible for a specific LED display pattern and configuration of some control signals. The ledr signal is assigned a binary pattern '1110000000', which would light up some particular set of LEDs depending upon the configuration. The signals en_lfsr and start_delay are both forced to logic low '0', which means the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) and certain delay are disabled during the execution of this block. Thus, the block configures a specific LED output pattern under certain conditions and also manipulates two control signals.
