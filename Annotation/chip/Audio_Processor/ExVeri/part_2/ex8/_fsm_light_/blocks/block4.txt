Comment: 
The function of this block, labeled as 'LIGHT6', is to control an LED array and certain aspects of an LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register). In detail, it drives ten LED lights designated by 'ledr', turning the two rightmost ones OFF and the remainder ON as specified by the binary value ('10'b1111111000'). Furthermore, it deactivates the LFSR and the delay start signal by assigning 'en_lfsr' and 'start_delay' with a low signal ('1'b0').
