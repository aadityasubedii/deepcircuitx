Comment: 
The block of code labeled as LIGHT3 is primarily responsible for LED display management. It drives the specific pattern of the first four LEDs on high and the rest on low, represented by the binary pattern '1111000000'. Concurrently, it also disables the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) and the start delay by assigning them zero.
