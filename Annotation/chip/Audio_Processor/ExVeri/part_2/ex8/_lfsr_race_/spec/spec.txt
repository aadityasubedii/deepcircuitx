Module name: lfsr_race. 

Module specification: The module lfsr_race is designed as a 15-bit linear feedback shift register (LFSR) implemented in Verilog. This register is initialized with a decimal value of 25 and advances its state on every high-edge clock cycle given that the signal 'enable' is high. The progression is done through a feedback function characterized by an XOR of the 14th, 10th, 6th, and 1st bit of the shift register. 

This module has two input ports: 'clock' and 'enable'. 'clock' port is used to time the progression of the shift register â€“ the state advances on its positive edge. 'enable' is a control signal, when high (1), allows the shift register state to update, and when low (0), it stops further updates keeping the state same. 

The module has only one output port: 'out'. It provides the current state of the 15-bit internal signal 'sreg', acting as a window into the module's internal state and useful for other modules within the larger system. 

Internally, a register 'sreg' is used which serves as a state holder for the LFSR. On each positive edge, if 'enable' is high, 'sreg' advances based on the feedback function, the result of which is assigned to the 'out' port. 

In terms of structure, the module encompasses initial block which initializes 'sreg' with 14'd25, a sequential block triggered at every positive edge of the clock signal controlling the updates to 'sreg', and finally a continuous assignment which assigns the state of 'sreg' to the output port 'out'.
