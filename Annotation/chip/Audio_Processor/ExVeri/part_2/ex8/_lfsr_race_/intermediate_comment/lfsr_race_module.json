    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, lfsr_race, implements a 15-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), which is initialized to 25 and advances on a high-edge clock if 'enable' is high. Advancement is through a feedback function: an XOR of bits 14, 10, 6, and 1 of the shift register ('sreg'). Inputs: 'clock' (times the state progression) and 'enable' (controls state updates). Output: 'out' (provides current state of 'sreg'). The module uses positive-edge clocking and continuous assignment for its operation. Operating structure consists of initial, sequential, and continuous assignment blocks."
