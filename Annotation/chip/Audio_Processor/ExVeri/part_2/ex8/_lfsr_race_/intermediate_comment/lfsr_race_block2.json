    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a 15-bit pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) generator. On every positive edge of the clock, if the enable signal is active, it shifts the entire 15-bit register (sreg) right and generates the new MSB bit as the XOR of the 0th, 5th, 9th, and 14th bit of the shifted register. This implementation creates a maximal length LFSR sequence based on the specified taps."
