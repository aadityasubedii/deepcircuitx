The LFSR is initialized with a value of 25, and at each clock cycle, if the 'enable' signal is high, it advances the state based on a feedback function. The feedback function implemented here is an XOR of the 14th, 10th, 6th, and 1st bit of the shifter register. The current state of the LFSR is available on the 'out' port."

Whenever there is a positive edge on this signal, the shift register will move to the next state, provided the 'enable' signal is high. The 'enable' port is a control signal. When 'enable' is high (1), the shift register state updates; when 'enable' is low (0), the state of the shift register remains the same.\n\nOutput ports: out. \nExplanation: The 'out' port provides the current state of the shift register 'sreg'. This 15-bit signal provides insight into the internal state of the module and can be used by other modules in the larger system."
