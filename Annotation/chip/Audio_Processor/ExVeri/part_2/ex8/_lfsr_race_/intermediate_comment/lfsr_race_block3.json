    "block_comment": "This line of code initializes the 14-bit register named 'sreg' to the decimal value 25. This initialization assigns a default start-up value to 'sreg', and is executed at the start of simulation or whenever a reset signal is applied to the component in the hardware design. The whole process is done at the very beginning of the simulation modeling or while resetting during the runtime."
