Module name: delay. 

Module specification: 
The delay module is designed to implement a delay counter, useful for scenarios that require a delay or time synchronization in data flows or operations. It utilizes the system clock 'sysclk', a trigger control signal, and a delay count input 'n'. The 'sysclk' serves as a synchronizing signal for the module; 'trigger' initiates the count of clock cycles and resets the count and output when low; 'n' defines the number of clock cycles to be matched before setting the output high, effectively determining the delay period. The module's output is 'time_out', a signal that goes high after a specified delay as defined by 'n'. Internal signals include 'count', a register used to track the number of clock cycles during the trigger's high state, and 'time_out', a registered output signal that goes high when 'count' equals 'n'. The code comprises mainly a single 'always' block executed upon every positive edge of the system clock. Within this block, operations are bifurcated depending upon the state of the 'trigger' signal, making provisions for counting clock cycles, comparing the count to 'n', controlling the 'time_out' signal, and resetting the 'count' and 'time_out'. This specification provides a comprehensive overview of the delay module's design and operation.
