    "module": "Module-level comment: \nThe 'delay' module implements a delay counter using input signals 'sysclk', 'trigger', and 'n'. On every positive edge of 'sysclk', it begins counting cycles if 'trigger' is high. Once it matches the count to input 'n', it sets 'time_out' high, indicating a delay completion. If 'trigger' is low, the count and 'time_out' are reset. Internally, it utilizes 'count' to track cycles and 'time_out' for delay indication. The logic is implemented within an 'always' block triggered at the clock's positive edge.\n"
