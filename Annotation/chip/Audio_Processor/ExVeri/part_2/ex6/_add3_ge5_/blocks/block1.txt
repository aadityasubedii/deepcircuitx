This block of code functions as a simple binary counter in Verilog, mapping input `iW` to output `oA`. It uses a case statement that gets triggered on changes in `iW` input. Each input value of `iW` from `4'b0000` to `4'b1100` corresponds to a unique output value of `oA`. The values of `oA` mirror those of `iW` up to `4'b0100`, after which they increment by adding `4'b0111` until they reach `4'b1111`. When `iW` has a value not described by the cases, `oA` defaults to `4'b0000`.
