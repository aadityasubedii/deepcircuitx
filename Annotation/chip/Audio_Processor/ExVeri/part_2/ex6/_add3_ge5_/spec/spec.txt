Module name: add3_ge5. 

Module specification: The module, add3_ge5, can be described as a 4-bit adder that performs operations based on the input binary number, iW. The module add3_ge5 has only one input port, iW, that is a 4-bit binary number, and one output port, oA, that is a 4-bit register that stores the result of the operation. For this module, there are no internal signals used as additional register or wire variables. The code comprises an always block that gets triggered by any change in the input iW and executes the case statement that's within it. This case statement is used to define the output oA based on the input value. For inputs ranging from 4'b0000 to 4'b0100, the output is the same as the input. For inputs from 4'b0101 to 4'b1100, three is added to the input value to get the output. For any other, not defined inputs, the output defaults to 4'b0000, serving as a safety precaution for unexpected or unhandled inputs.
