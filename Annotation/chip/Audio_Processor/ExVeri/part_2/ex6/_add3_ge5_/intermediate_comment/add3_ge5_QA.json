It takes a 4-bit input `iW` and depending on the value of `iW`, the output `oA` is set. For `iW` values from 4'b0000 to 4'b0100 (0 to 4 in decimal), the `oA` is the same as the input. For `iW` values from 4'b0101 to 4'b1100 (5 to 12 in decimal), three is added to the input value to get the output `oA`. For any input not defined within the mentioned range, it defaults the output to 4'b0000."
