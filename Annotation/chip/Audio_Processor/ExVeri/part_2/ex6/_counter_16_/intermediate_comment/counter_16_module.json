    "module": "Module-level comment: The counter_16 module is a 16-bit counter that increments on a positive clock edge when enable is high and reset is low or resets to zero when both enable and reset are high. Internally, it uses a registered 'count' signal to maintain its current state. The module contains signal declarations, initializes 'count' to zero, and an always block that controls the counter's operations with the clock signal's positive edge."
