    "block_comment": "This block of code is a counter which increments on a positive clock edge if the `enable` signal is set, and resets if both `enable` and `reset` signals are set. The condition is implemented using a simple if-else construct - If `enable` is high and `reset` is low, it increments the `count`, and when both `enable` and `reset` are high, it resets `count` to 0."
