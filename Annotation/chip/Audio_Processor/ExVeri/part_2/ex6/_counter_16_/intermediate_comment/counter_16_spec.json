    "spec": "Module name: counter_16. \n\nModule specification: The counter_16 is a Verilog-designed, 16-bit counter module that operates based on the state of three input signals - clock, enable, and reset. Its operations trigger on the rising edge of the input clock signal. By default, when the enable signal is high and the reset signal is low, the counter increments by one unit. However, if both the enable and reset signals are high, the counter resets itself to 0, maintaining its current value when other conditions are not met. The module abstracts these functions through a single output port named 'count'. The 'count' is a 16-bit signal reflecting the current state of the counter. Internally, 'count' is also used as a registered signal updated based on the signals at the positive clock edge. The module consists of signal declarations, an initialization block setting the initial 'count' value, and an always block dictating the counter's behavior with the rising clock edges. The overall design of the counter_16 module showcases an optimized, edge-triggered function that allows flexible control over the counting operation.",
