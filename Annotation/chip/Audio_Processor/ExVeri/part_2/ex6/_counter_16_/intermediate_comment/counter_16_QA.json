The functionality of the module is: \nWhen the clock signal is positive edge (on the rising edge), and the enable signal is high, the counter value increases by one. If the reset signal is also high at this time, the counter resets to zero. If the enable signal is '0', the counter will not change. This means that the count is either incremented or reset based on conditions of the enable and reset signal during a positive clock edge."

The operations within the module trigger on the rising edge of the clock signal.\n- Enable: This signal is used to control whether the counter is in active mode or not. If the enable signal is high ('1'), the counter will operate, otherwise it stays static.\n- Reset: This signal is used to reset the counter value to zero.

It shows the current value of the 16-bit counter. Its value is either incremented or reset depending on the state of the enable and reset signals on the positive edge of the clock."

Otherwise, the count signal increments by 1. It retains its value until the next clock edge if the conditions are not met. This signal serves as the crucial memory element for the counter's current state."
