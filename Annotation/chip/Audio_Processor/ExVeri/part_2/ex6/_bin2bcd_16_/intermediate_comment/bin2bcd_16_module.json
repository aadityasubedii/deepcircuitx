    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'bin2bcd_16' module is dedicated to the conversion of an input 16-bit binary number to five 4-bit BCD outputs. This conversion process is achieved with the implementation of 'add3_ge5' instances and internal 4-bit width wires: 'w1 to w35' hold interstage values, while 'a1 to a35' hold the output from each 'add3_ge5'. Interconnected with assign statements for iterative addition, these components effectively translate the binary input into BCD outputs."
