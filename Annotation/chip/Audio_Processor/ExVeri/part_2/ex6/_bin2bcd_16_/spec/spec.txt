Module name: bin2bcd_16.

Module specification: The bin2bcd_16 module is a component for binary to BCD conversion, as its name implies. It takes in a 16-bit binary input (B) which is then processed and converted to five 4-bit BCD outputs (BCD_0, BCD_1, BCD_2, BCD_3, and BCD_4) representing the decimal digits of the binary input.

The input to this module is constituted by the 16-bit binary port B, the value of which is to be converted. The outputs, BCD_0 through BCD_4, are 4-bit BCD representations of the input binary number with BCD_0 to BCD_4 forming the decimal digits from least significant to most significant.

Internally, this module uses two sets of wires: w1 to w35 and a1 to a35, both of the 4-bit width. Wires w1 to w35 hold values of the input binary number during the conversion process, while the wires a1 to a35 carry the output from the 'add3_ge5' instances that add necessary values together based on each iteration of the conversion process. These signals serve as intermediaries in the transmission of information from the input to the conversion units and from these units to the output.

The module consists of instanced modules named 'add3_ge5', that process the conversion from binary to BCD using iterative addition operations, and several assign blocks that guide these operations step by step. The final lines rectify data from the wires related to the last steps of the conversion into the output ports BCD_0 to BCD_4, thereby concluding the conversion process.
