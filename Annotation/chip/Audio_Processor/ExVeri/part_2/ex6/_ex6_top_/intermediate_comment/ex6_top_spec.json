    "spec": "Module name: ex6_top. \n\nModule specification: The ex6_top module is essentially a counter that operates on a 50 MHz clock input, used to drive a 16-bit counter. This counter is enabled by a 'tick' signal generated by a clock divider module, gated with the inverted value of 0th element of the KEY input. The 16-bit count is transformed by a binary to BCD converter module, resulting in 5 sections of 4-bit BCD values. These BCD values are sent to five instances of a 'hex_to_7seg' module (a binary to 7-segment display converter), each driving corresponding HEX[0-4] outputs, possibly representing a 5-digit decimal display.\n\nInput ports comprise of CLOCK_50, acting as the clock input for the circuitry, and a 2-bit KEY array serving as control inputs, with key[1] leveraged as counter's reset command and key[0] contributing in enabling the counter.\n\nOutput ports include HEX0[6:0], HEX1[6:0], HEX2[6:0], HEX3[6:0], HEX4[6:0], which drive separate segments of a 5-digit display after processing the count value via binary to BCD transformation and hex_to_7seg conversion.\n\nInternal signals include 5 instances of 4-bit wide BCD counters (BCD0-BCD4), a 16-bit counter (count), 'tick', and 'enable'. BCD signals reflect the bin-to-BCD-converted count value. 'count' records the current counter value, 'tick' acts as a frequency-divided version of input clock, and 'enable' allows decoding the counter value to BCD by ANDing 'tick' and NOT of KEY[0]. The counter increments on the falling edge of 'enable' signal.\n\nThe code consists of various sub-modules, like a clock divider module to generate 'tick', binary to BCD converter module for 16-bit 'count' conversion, counter module that takes in 'enable' and reset signal to operate 16-bit 'count', and instances of hex_to_7seg module to transform each 4-bit BCD value into corresponding HEX signals for segment display. \n",
