    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'ex6_top' module is a 5-digit counter using a 50MHz clock. It encompasses sub-modules including a clock divider (for creating a 'tick' control signal), a binary to BCD converter (for converting 16-bit count to BCD form), and five instances of 7-segment display converters (for driving HEX[0-4] displays). The KEY[1] and KEY[0] inputs are used for resetting and enabling the counter respectively. The incremental count on 'enable' signal's falling edge gets processed further for display."
