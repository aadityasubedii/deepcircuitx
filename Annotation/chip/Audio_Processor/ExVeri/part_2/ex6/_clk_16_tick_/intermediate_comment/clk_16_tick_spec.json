    "spec": "Module name: clk_16_tick. \n\nModule specification: The clk_16_tick is a Verilog-implemented counter module. It operates by counting the number of clock cycles received from an input port labeled 'clkin' in a 16-bit register called 'count'. The count increases by 1 with every positive edge of the clock cycle. Once the count value hits a predefined limit (50336 in decimal or '16'b1100001101010000' in binary), it resets to 0, and an output signal 'tick' is set to high, indicating that the preset value has been reached. Outside this condition, 'tick' is kept low. \n\nThe module has one input port, 'clkin', which serves as the input clock signal that drives the operation of the module. The 'tick' signal is the module's output and acts as an indicator that signals when the internal count has reached the preset value. \n\nInternally, the module uses two main signals: 'count' and 'tick'. 'Count' is a 16-bit register that keeps track of the number of input clock signals. 'Tick', on the other hand, is a binary signal that flags the reaching of the preset limit by the 'count'. \n\nThe Verilog code for this module is organized into a setup section where initial values are assigned to 'tick' and 'count', and an always block. This block checks at every positive edge of the clock if the count has reached a preset value and sets the tick accordingly while incrementing or resetting the count. This operation forms the main functional logic of the clk_16_tick module. The design and operation of this module make it ideal for timing and scheduling related tasks in complex digital systems.\n",
