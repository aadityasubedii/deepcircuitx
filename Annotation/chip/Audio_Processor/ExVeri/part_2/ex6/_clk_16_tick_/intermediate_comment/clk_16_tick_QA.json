It generates an output signal, 'tick', and resets its internal counter each time the counter reaches '16'b1100001101010000' or 50336 in decimal, and increments by 1 at the positive edge of every 'clkin' otherwise. 'tick' is set high when the preset count is reached, and it's reset to low otherwise. The input signal is 'clkin', and 'tick' is the output signal. The count is a variable stored in a 16-bit register. It starts from 0 and increments by 1 when the input clock signal rises, until it reaches the preset value where it resets back to 0."
