Module name: hex_to_7seg. 

Module specification: The hex_to_7seg module is a Verilog module specifically designed to convert a hexadecimal input into a 7-segment LED display format. The display format indicates the appropriately encoded numerical digit corresponding to the hexadecimal input on a 7-segment LED display board commonly used in digital clocks or counters. The input port, named 'in', is a 4-bit bus that accepts hexadecimal numbers as inputs. This port is designed to interpret the hexadecimal input to the module.

The module has an output port named 'out', which is a 7-bit bus that serves to hold and display the 7-segment conversion of the hexadecimal input. Each bit of this bus corresponds to an individual LED segment on the 7-segment display. The status of each bit (whether 'on' or 'off') will directly control its corresponding LED segment on the display, thus determining the displayed digit. 

The module also utilizes an internal signal, also named 'out'. This register is essential for holding the 7-segment display values counterpart to the hexadecimal input between clock cycles. It serves as the main actor in the conversion process set out in the case statement, indicating the seven-segment conversion for each of the possible sixteen hexadecimal inputs ranging from 4'h0 to 4'hf, where each hexadecimal number is mapped to its corresponding 7-segment LED display representation. The implementation is such that the code can both simulate and synthesize the necessary outputs for each hexadecimal input correctly, enabling correct digital display.
