    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, hex_to_7seg, performs the conversion of a 4-bit hexadecimal input to a 7-bit bus output, suited for 7-segment LED display. The 4-bit input 'in' is mapped to its corresponding 7-segment format using a case statement. The 7-bit register 'out' holds the resultant, which is feed to the output port 'out'. Each bit of output corresponds to an LED segment in the display, controlling its on-off state, and together, these bits determine the displayed digit."
