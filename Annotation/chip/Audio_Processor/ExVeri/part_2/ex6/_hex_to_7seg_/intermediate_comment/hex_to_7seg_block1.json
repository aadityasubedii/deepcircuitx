    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is designed to implement a 4-to-7 binary decoder. The code receives a 4-bit hexadecimal input and accordingly assigns a unique 7-bit binary output for each possible input from '0' to 'f'. The assignments are carried out in a combinatorial fashion through a case statement, which operates by matching the input with one of the predefined hexadecimal values and assigning the corresponding binary output."
