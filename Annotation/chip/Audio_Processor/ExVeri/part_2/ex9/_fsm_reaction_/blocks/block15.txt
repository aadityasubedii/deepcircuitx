This block of code is used to initialize the variable 'start_count' to a binary value of 0. It is a single line command that comes in handy during the initial phase where the variable needs to be set to a particular default value before it gets used in the computations ahead in the circuit design. The 'initial' keyword in Verilog means the statements within the initial block are executed once at simulation time 0. Here it is used with 'start_count' indicating that 'start_count' should be assigned a value of 0 at the start of the simulation. The '1'b0' essentially is a one-bit binary of value 0.
