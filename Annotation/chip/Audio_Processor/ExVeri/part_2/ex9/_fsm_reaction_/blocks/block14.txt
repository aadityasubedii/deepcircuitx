Comment: 
This block of Verilog code serves as a state machine that controls the sequential lighting of ten lights and then reverts to an idle state upon completion. Upon a positive edge of an input signal 'tick', and when the system is in "IDLE" state awaiting a 'trigger' signal, if a 'trigger' occurs, the system State will transition to "LIGHT0". This pattern continues through LIGHT9 after consecutive 'tick' signals. Once the 'time_out' signal is generated, it transitions from "LIGHT9" state to "REACTION" state. Finally, when the 'count_over' condition is satisfied it reverts back to "IDLE" state. The default is an idle state if none of the specified conditions are met.
