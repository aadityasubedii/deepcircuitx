The IDLE block serves as the initialization state for the hardware. It is setting the LEDs (ledr) to '0' indicating their off state, enables the linear feedback shift register (en_lfsr) to begin operation, while all start_delay, start_count and reset_count signals are reset to '0', allowing any dependent subsequent processes to start from a clean state.
