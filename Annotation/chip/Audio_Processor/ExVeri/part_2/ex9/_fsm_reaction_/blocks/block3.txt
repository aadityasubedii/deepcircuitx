Comment: 
This block of code, labeled "LIGHT8", controls the settings of an 8-light LED system. It implements the changes by assigning values to control signals in the system. The LED lights are set to display the binary representation '1111111110', indicating that all but the rightmost LED are active. The 'en_lfsr' signal is set to '0', which usually means that the operation of a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is disabled. The 'start_delay' and 'start_count' signals are also set to '0', halting any ongoing delays or counts. Finally, 'reset_count' is also set to '0', indicating that the count value isn't being reset in this state of operation.
