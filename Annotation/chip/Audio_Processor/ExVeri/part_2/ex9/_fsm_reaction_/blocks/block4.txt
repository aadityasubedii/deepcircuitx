Comment: 
The function of this block, labeled LIGHT7, is to control various outputs and flags associated with an LED and a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). It sets the 10-bit 'ledr' to a binary value which turns on all but the last two LEDs. The 'en_lfsr' bit is reset to 0 indicating that the LFSR is disabled. The 'start_delay' and 'start_count' signals are also reset to 0, stopping any ongoing count or delay processes. Finally, the 'reset_count' is set to 0 leading to resetting of any ongoing count operation.
