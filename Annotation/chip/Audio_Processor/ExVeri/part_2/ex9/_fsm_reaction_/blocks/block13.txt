This block represents a state machine controlling a sequence of LED lights and other related properties based on the current state. Depending on its state, different properties and signals are set to predefined values. In IDLE state, all LEDs are off (represented by ledr <= 10'b0000000000) and only the linear-feedback shift register (lfsr) is active. From LIGHT0 to LIGHT9 states, consecutive LEDs are turned on step by step, with a reset operation performed in LIGHT0 state. In the REACTION state, all LEDs are off and the count operation is started. Each state enables or disables specific processes and assigns different values to the LED lights or other signal variables.
