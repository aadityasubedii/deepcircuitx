    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a finite state machine (FSM) module which reacts based on various input signals. The FSM is clocked with clk, reacts to tick and trigger signals, and can time out or count over. It is also enabled with an LFSR signal (en_lfsr), starts the delay with start_delay, starts counting with start_count, and resets count with reset_count. The outcome of the FSM's reactions is depicted through the ledr output."
