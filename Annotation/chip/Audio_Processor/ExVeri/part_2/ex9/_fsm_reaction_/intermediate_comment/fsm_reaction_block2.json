    "block_comment": "This block of code, labeled as LIGHT9, controls the operation of a specific state in a finite state machine (FSM). The implementation first turns on all the ten LED lights, as indicated by the `ledr` line where all bits are set to 1. Then, it disables the linear feedback shift register (LFSR) with `en_lfsr` set to 0. It starts a delay operation using `start_delay`, and concurrently stops any ongoing count by setting `start_count` and `reset_count` to 0."
