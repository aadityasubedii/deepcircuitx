    "block_comment": "This block of code defines constant parameters for representing different light states in a 12-bit system. Each light (LIGHT0 to LIGHT9) is indicated by a single bit being set in a specific position of the 12-bit number, allowing for straightforward identification and control of individual lights. Additionally, the parameter REACTION is defined, potentially to indicate a particular state or reaction in the system. Each parameter is represented as a binary code, simplifying the process of detecting which light is on in a digital system."
