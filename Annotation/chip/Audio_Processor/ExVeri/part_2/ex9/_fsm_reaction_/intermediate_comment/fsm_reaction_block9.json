    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog code block defines a state in a State machine, named 'LIGHT2'. Upon entering this state, it drives the 'ledr' output to light up the third through sixth LEDs from the left, and disables the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) by grounding 'en_lfsr'. It also stores a logic low value in the 'start_delay', 'start_count', and 'reset_count' registers, thus indicating the start of the delay, counting, and reset processes respectively have not been triggered."
