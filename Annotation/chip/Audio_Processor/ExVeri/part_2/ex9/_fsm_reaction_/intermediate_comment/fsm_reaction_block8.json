    "block_comment": "The block of code named LIGHT3 configures the system into a setting where the upper four LEDs are lit, and all system functionalities linked to the LFSR counter, initial count start, delay start, and counter reset are deactivated. It achieves this by setting 'ledr' to a binary value that lights up four LEDs, and asserting the 'en_lfsr', 'start_delay', 'start_count', and 'reset_count' to 0, effectively disabling these features in the current state."
