    "block_comment": "The block \"LIGHT6\" controls a specific stage of an LED operation. It controls LED behavior by setting the 10-bit 'ledr' register to display only the first two LEDs with the remaining turned off. It also sets the 'en_lfsr' enable signal for an LFSR operation to '0', disabling this feature. The 'start_delay' and 'start_count' are also deactivated, indicating that this stage does not involve incremental delays or counts. Similarly, the 'reset_count' signal is deactivated, suggesting this stage does not have a resetting function."
