    "block_comment": "This block of code, labeled as LIGHT4, controls the state transitions of an LED shift register. Upon entering the LIGHT4 state, higher-order five of the ten illuminating LEDs are turned on which is indicated by '1111100000' while the lower-order five are off. During this phase, the linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is disabled (en_lfsr = '0'), resetting all start_delay, start_count, reset_count to '0' which implies that any ongoing delay, count or reset operation is ceased, putting the system back to its initial condition."
