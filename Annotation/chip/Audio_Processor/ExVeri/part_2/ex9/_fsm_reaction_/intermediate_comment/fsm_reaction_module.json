    "module": "Module-level comment: The fsm_reaction module is a Finite State Machine controlling 10 LEDs and an LFSR. It uses five inputs: clk, tick, trigger, time_out, and count_over for state transitions, from IDLE through LIGHT0 to LIGHT9, and to REACTION. Outputs indicate LFSR status, start of delay, start and reset of count, and LED states. Internally, state transitions are controlled with a case statement in an always block. Another always block sets the output values for each state. LED states represented using a 10-bit LED register, and other states use 1-bit registers."
