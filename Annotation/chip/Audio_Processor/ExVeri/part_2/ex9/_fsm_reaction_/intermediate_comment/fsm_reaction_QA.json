The FSM has 11 states, including the IDLE and 10 LIGHT states, and a REACTION state. The state transitions occur based on the tick, trigger, time_out, and count_over signals. Each state also defines the status of LEDs (indicated by ledr), enables the LFSR (en_lfsr), and determines certain actions like delay start (start_delay), count start (start_count), and count reset (reset_count). The LIGHT stages sequentially light LEDs, simulating a shift effect. The REACTION state resets the FSM when the count is over."
