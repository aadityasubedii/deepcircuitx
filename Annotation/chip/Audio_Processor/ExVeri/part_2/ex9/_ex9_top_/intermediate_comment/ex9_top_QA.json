It's a reaction time measurement system that primarily includes timing units, a pseudo-random binary sequence generator, state machine logic for the core functionalities, a delay unit, counting logic for measuring reaction time, binary to BCD conversion, and finally, BCD to 7-segment display conversion for visual output. The user reaction is fetched using KEY inputs and the calculation appears in HEX displays while some result processing is shown through LEDR. It is synchronized by a clock signal (CLOCK_50)."
