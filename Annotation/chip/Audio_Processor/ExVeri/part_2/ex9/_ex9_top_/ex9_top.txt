Module-level comment: The 'ex9_top' module measures user reaction time using various submodules. The module is clocked by 'CLOCK_50' and takes 'KEY' as input to start/count/interact with submodules. It generates seven-segment display outputs ('HEX0' to 'HEX4') and LED outputs ('LEDR'). Internally, time tick signals, state machine enablers, delay signals, and PRBS are utilized. Key submodules include clock tick generators, a PRBS generator, a delay unit, a counter, and conversion units from binary to BCD, and BCD to 7-segment display.
