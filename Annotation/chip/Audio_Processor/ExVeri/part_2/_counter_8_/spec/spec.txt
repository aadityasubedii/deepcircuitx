Module name: counter_8. Module specification: The counter_8 is a module designed to function as an 8-bit counter. Its operation is dictated by a clock signal, used to sequence its operations, and an enable signal, which, when high, permits counter incrementation at each positive edge of the clock cycle. On initialization, the counter resets to zero. The module has two input ports: 'clock' and 'enable'. The 'clock' input effectively dictates the tempo at which the counter operates, while 'enable' grants permission for incrementation to occur when high. There is one output port 'count', an 8-bit signal reflecting the current value of the counter, incremented upon each positive clock edge where 'enable' is high. Internally, an equivalent 'count' signal exists to track the state of the counter. The code is divided into two blocks. The first sets the 'count' to zero at the initialization, and the second continuously checks for the positive edge of the clock and the high 'enable' signal to increment the 'count'.
