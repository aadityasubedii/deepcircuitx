    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, counter_8, is an 8-bit counter that increments at the rise of each clock cycle when 'enable' signal is high. It's initialized with count signal set to zero. It uses a clock input for operation scheduling, an 'enable' input to control incrementation, and an output 'count' to reflect the current count value externally. The 'count' is incremented on a positive clock edge, given 'enable' is high."
