The count is reset to 0 when the module is initialized."

Explanation: The 'clock' port is a signal that periodically switches between high and low and is used to sequence the circuit's operations. The 'enable' port determines whether the counter should increment during the next clock cycle. If the 'enable' signal is high, the counter will increment at the next positive clock edge.\n\nOutput ports: count. Explanation: The 'count' port signals the current value of the counter. It is an 8-bit number that is incremented for each positive edge of the clock when the enable signal is high."
