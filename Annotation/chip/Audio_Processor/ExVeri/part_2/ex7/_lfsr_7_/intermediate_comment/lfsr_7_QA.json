When the enable signal is active, at each rising edge of the clock, the module shifts the `sreg` register bits to the right. The new most significant bit (bit 7) is the result of a XOR operation between the old bit 7 and bit 1 of `sreg`. This operation can generate a sequence of pseudo-random numbers. The output of the module is the current state of `sreg`. If the module is not enabled, `sreg` doesn't change."
