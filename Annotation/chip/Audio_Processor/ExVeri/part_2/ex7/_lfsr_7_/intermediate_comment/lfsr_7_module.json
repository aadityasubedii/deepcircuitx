    "module": "Module-level comment: The `lfsr_7` module is a 7-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), which generates a sequence of pseudo-random numbers. Operating synchronously on the clock's rising edge, it updates a 7-bit `sreg` register when the `enable` signal is active. The update involves a right shift on `sreg`, and an XOR operation between the old seventh and first bits to create the new most significant bit. The output `out` reflects the current state of `sreg`."
