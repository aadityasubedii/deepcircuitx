    "spec": "Module name: `lfsr_7`. \n\nModule specification: The `lfsr_7` module represents a 7-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). The primary function of this module is to generate a sequence of pseudo-random numbers when the enable signal is activated. It operates synchronously with the rising edge of the input `clock` signal. When enabled, it updates the 7-bit register `sreg` by shifting its contents to the right and generating a new most significant bit as the exclusive OR (XOR) operation result of the prior seventh and first bits. The `enable` port is an input that controls whether the LFSR operation should occur, while the `clock` port is another input that provides the timing for the operational synchronism. The output port, `out`, mirrors the current state of `sreg`, consequently presenting the result of the shift and XOR operation. The main sections of the code define the ports, initialize the `sreg` register, dictate the LFSR operation through an always block, and link the `sreg` state to the `out` output. The internal register `sreg` is a vital part of the module, serving as storage that maintains the current state of the LFSR operation.",
