    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'hex_to_7seg' module is a hexadecimal to 7-segment decoder, taking a 4-bit hexadecimal input ('in') and generating a 7-bit output ('out') that corresponds to the 7-segment representation of the input. It uses a case statement to map each possible hexadecimal input to its 7-segment display equivalent, storing and outputting the result through the 'out' register."
