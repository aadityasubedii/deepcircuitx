It takes a 4-bit hexadecimal input and generates a 7-bit output that can light up the appropriate segments on a 7-segment display to represent the hexadecimal digit. The conversion from hexadecimal to 7-segment compatible format is done via the case statement. Depending on the hexadecimal digit, the correct segments of the 7-segment display are lit up."
