Module name: hex_to_7seg. 

Module specification: The hex_to_7seg module functions as a hexadecimal to 7-segment decoder, translating a 4-bit hexadecimal input into a 7-bit output to be displayed on a 7-segment display interface. It uses a single 4-bit wide input port named 'in' which is designed to receive the hexadecimal digit to be displayed. Conversely, the module features a 7-bit wide output port named 'out', which drives the individual segments of the 7-segment display. Noteworthy, the value presented on this output port represents the original hexadecimal number in a 7-segment compatible format, allowing the correct display of the digit. Internally, the module uses a 7-bit wide register 'out' to temporarily store the 7-segment code corresponding to the input hexadecimal number. The value of this register is determined by a comprehensive case statement, which ensures the correct encoding of each potential hexadecimal digit input into the proper 7-segment display format. The result of this case statement directly sets the value of 'out', thereby driving the 7-segment display.
