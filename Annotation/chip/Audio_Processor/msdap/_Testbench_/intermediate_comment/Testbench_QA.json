This is also supported by the names of its internal signals and their usage. The module performs tasks like checking if two versions of digital audio processor (RTL and behavioral versions as implied by \"_rtl\" and \"_beh\" suffixes) perform identically under the same inputs and it outputs mismatches, if any, into an output file \"output.txt\". The module also keeps track of the number of total mismatches. It seems to implement clock signals for these modules and provides a mechanism for feeding them input data from an external file \"data1.in\".
