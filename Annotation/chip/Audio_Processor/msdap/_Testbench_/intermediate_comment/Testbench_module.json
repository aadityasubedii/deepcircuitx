    "module": "Module-level comment: The Peer_Test module compares outputs of RTL and behavioral versions of a digital audio processor. It reads digitized audio data inputs from a file, feeds these to the processors, and tracks an output mismatch. The module mainly functions through input-output and internal signal manipulations inside two always blocks running on digital and sampling clock edges. Disparities are tracked using XOR operations and the number of mismatches is retained and output into a file when detected."
