Module name: Peer_Test. 

Module specification: The Peer_Test module is a testbench used for comparing the outputs of two versions of a digital audio processing system - a register-transfer level (RTL) version and a behavioural version. The module performs tasks such as reading digitized audio input data from a file, applying them to the digital audio processors, and comparing their outputs. 

Input ports include a digital clock (Dclk), a sample clock (Sclk), a negative reset signal (Reset_n), a frame signal (Frame), a start command (Start), and left (InputL) and right (InputR) channel audio inputs. Output ports include signals indicating readiness to accept next input or to provide next output for behavioral version (InReady_beh, OutReady_beh), RTL version (InReady_rtl, OutReady_rtl) and the system under test (InReady, OutReady); and the left (OutputL_beh, OutputL_rtl) and right (OutputR_beh, OutputR_rtl) channel outputs from both versions. 

Internal signals include data for maintaining the input data to be fed to the system, registers writeL and writeR for maintaining the mismatched left and right channel data respectively, a flag reset_flag for controlling the reset process, OutputL and OutputR which are XORs of the behavioural and RTL outputs, and a counter mismatch to count the number of mismatches. 

The module has different blocks for handling different tasks - loading the input data from a file, generating the Dclk and Sclk signals, controlling the feeding of input data to the systems under test and comparing their outputs, and writing mismatch data to an output file in case of discrepancies. The core functionality is encapsulated in two always blocks that govern the flow of data into and out of the systems under test.
