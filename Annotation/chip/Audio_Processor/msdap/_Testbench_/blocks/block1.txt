Comment: 
This block of code functions as a XOR-based data comparison and logging module in a digital signal processing system. At every positive edge of the system clock (Sclk), if the output is ready (OutReady), XOR operations are performed between right and left channel outputs (OutputL and OutputR) at behavioral and RTL levels. The results are stored and written into file 'fp'. This continues to be decremented until 'i' reaches less than zero, at which point the process resets. The block also tracks the number of mismatches detected.
