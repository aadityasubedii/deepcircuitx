Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages a reset operation and data handling for frames based on clock cycles and specified conditions. Upon the positive edge of the digital clock (Dclk), the system checks if 'j' equals 9458 or 13058 and if a reset flag is not set; if both conditions are true, it generates a reset. If either there is incoming data readiness signaled (InReady) or the reset flag is set, it checks if 'j' is less than 15056 to engage with the data. A frame is set if 'k' equals 15. It gets an input from the data matrix and decreases 'k'. When 'k' equals -1, it resets 'k' to 15, increments 'j' by 2, and resets the flag if it was set.
