    "block_comment": "This block of code defines registers in a Verilog design. A 6-bit register `PISO_count_L` is declared for counting or indexing purposes. A 40-bit register named `piso_reg_L`, likely used to store or manipulate significant amounts of data or interfacing with a device or system that requires 40-bit communication. Two single bit registers, `out_rdy_L` and `frame_flag_L`, are possibly control signals, indicating when output is ready and when a frame (data packet) flag has been triggered. Lastly, `OutReady_L` is another control signal probably indicating the readiness of an output data."
