    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for computing the ready state of the output. It achieves this by performing a logical AND operation on two input signals: OutReady_L and OutReady_R, and assigns the result to the output variable: OutReady. The output will only be marked as ready when both the left (OutReady_L) and right (OutReady_R) input signals are in the ready state."
