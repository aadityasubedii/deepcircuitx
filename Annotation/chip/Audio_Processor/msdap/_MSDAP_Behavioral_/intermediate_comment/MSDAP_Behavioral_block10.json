    "block_comment": "The block encompasses a process that gets triggered on the falling edge of a system clock (Dclk), a Reset signal, or a Start signal. When Reset goes low or Start signal is active, the block initializes `bit_count` to 16 and clears `input_rdy_flag`. After initialization, when the Frame signal is high, it reduces `bit_count` by 1, sets `input_rdy_flag` to 0, and logs `InputL` and `InputR` data at index 'bit_count' in `data_L` and `data_R` arrays. If the Frame signal is not high, it performs similar operations on signals `InputL` and `InputR` but sets `input_rdy_flag` to 1 when `bit_count` reaches 0."
