    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a finite state machine (FSM) that handles data processing tasks. It triggers on the falling edge ('negedge') of the clock (Dclk) or changes in the current process state (pr_state) and a reset control (Reset_n). The FSM operates in several states including Startup, Wait_rj, Read_rj, Wait_coeff, Read_coeff, Wait_input, Compute, Reset, and Sleep. Each state performs specific functions such as waiting for data, reading data, computation, and handling reset operations. Various types of data processing tasks involving data buffering, checking input readiness, incrementing counters, managing state transitions are utilized. Notably, the \"Compute\" state performs various operations involving data negation, incrementing count, and zero detection. The design is mostly data-driven, with transitions being reliant on specific conditions such as Frame signal and readiness of the input data (input_rdy_flag). The \"Reset\" state initiates a complete system reset, clearing all buffers and resetting counters. Completion of a computation cycle or no data input leads the FSM to the \"Sleep\" state, where it awaits further data inputs or a reset trigger."
