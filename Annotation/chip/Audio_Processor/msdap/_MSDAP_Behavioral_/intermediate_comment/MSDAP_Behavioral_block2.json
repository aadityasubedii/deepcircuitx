    "block_comment": "This block mainly involves parallel-to-serial conversion of data using an edge-triggered approach. At the falling edge of synchronous clock signal (Sclk), depending on certain flag conditions, the block functions by initializing several register values and performing specific operations. When 'Start' signal turns HIGH, it resets count and register values to initial state, setting the output ready signal to LOW. When an output flag is detected, it replaces the current serial output with a temporary value and sets output ready signal to HIGH. In response to a frame signal and when output is ready, it de-increments the counter and fetches serial data bit by bit from the Parallel-In-Serial-Out (PISO) register. If a frame flag is HIGH, it repeats the operation, resetting the flag when counter reaches zero. In other cases, it resets the counter and output readiness & output signals."
