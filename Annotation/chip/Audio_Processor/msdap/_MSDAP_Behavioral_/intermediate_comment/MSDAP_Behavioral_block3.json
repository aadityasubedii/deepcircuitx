    "block_comment": "This block is used for controlling the output operations of a parallel-in serial-out (PISO) shift register. On the falling edge of a system clock and when a `Start` signal is received, the register is reset and made ready for new data. If the `out_flag_L` is set, the register loads a new data from `out_temp_L` and makes it ready for output. Upon formation of a frame - indicated by `Frame` being `1` and the output being ready (`out_rdy_L` is `1`) without any previous frame flag (`frame_flag_L` is `0`) - output starts, whereby each time the output bit `OutputL` is assigned from the shift register (`piso_reg_L`), the counter decreases by 1. Once the frame is finished (`PISO_count_L` equals `0`), the output operation halts until a new frame signal is received. If no action is triggered, the register stays idle waiting for a `Start` signal."
