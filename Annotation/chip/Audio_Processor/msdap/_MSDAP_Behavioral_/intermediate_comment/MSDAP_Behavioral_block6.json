    "block_comment": "The block of code performs a synchronous reset and computation processing on a negative edge of a system clock (Sclk).  Upon reset, the compute flag, compute status, and x_count are all initialized to zero. If the reset is not active and either the compute flag or compute status are set, the block performs a series of computations updating coefficients, index, and temporary variables. Special procedures are in place if certain conditions meet, such as k_L equals to zero or a certain limit, which triggers further computation or updates to u_temp_L variable. Final results from computation are then stored in y_temp_L and out_temp_L, with corresponding flags updated accordingly."
