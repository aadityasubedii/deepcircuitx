Module name: Top. Module specification: The Top module implements a complex state machine for real-time data processing, likely part of a digital signal processing or communications system. It handles input data for left and right channels, processes them through multiple states, and produces output results. The module has input ports for system clock (Sclk), data clock (Dclk), start signal (Start), reset (Reset_n), left and right input data (InputL, InputR), and frame signal (Frame). Output ports include input ready signal (InReady), output ready signal (OutReady), and left and right output data (OutputL, OutputR). Internally, it utilizes numerous registers and arrays for state management, data storage, and computation, including state registers, counters, data buffers, coefficient arrays, and temporary computation registers. The module operates through several key blocks: input data handling, state machine control, computation for left and right channels,
