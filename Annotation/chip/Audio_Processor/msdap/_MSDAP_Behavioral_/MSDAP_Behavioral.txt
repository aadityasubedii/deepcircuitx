Module-level comment: This Top module implements a dual-channel data processing system with a state machine controller. It reads input data and coefficients, performs computations using a multi-state algorithm, and outputs processed results. The module features sleep mode for energy efficiency, handles reset conditions, and uses parallel-in-serial-out (PISO) for output. It employs separate processing paths for left and right channels, synchronizing operations with system and data clocks.
