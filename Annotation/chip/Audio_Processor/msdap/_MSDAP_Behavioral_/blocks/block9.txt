Comment: 
This block of code defines a state transition in a finite state machine (FSM) driven by the signal `Start` and the negative edge of `Dclk`. When the `Start` signal is high, the FSM enters the `Startup` state, otherwise it moves to the `next_state` as determined by other logic not shown in this block.
