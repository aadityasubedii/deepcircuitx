Module name: top_level. Module specification: The top_level module is a complex digital signal processing system that processes input data streams (InputL and InputR) and produces output data streams (OutputL and OutputR). It integrates various submodules including SIPO (Serial In Parallel Out), PISO (Parallel In Serial Out), memory blocks (RJmem, Hmem, Xmem), ALUs, and a controller. The module has input ports for system control (Reset, Frame, Dclk, Sclk, Start) and data input (InputL, InputR), and output ports for system status (InReady, OutReady) and processed data (OutputL, OutputR). Internally, it uses numerous signals (w1-w45) for interconnecting submodules, managing data flow, and control. The module is structured into several key sections: input data serialization (
