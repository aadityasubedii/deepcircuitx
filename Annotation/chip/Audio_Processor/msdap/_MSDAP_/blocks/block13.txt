Comment: 
The block is mainly responsible for managing memory write/read operations. When the start signal is asserted, it resets the done signal and the valid data signal and clears the output data. When the enable signal and the reset signal are both asserted, it erases the memory data at the write address and signals the completion of the write operation. When just the enable signal is asserted, if the write signal is also asserted, it writes the input data onto the memory address specified by the write address and signals the completion of the write operation, otherwise, it reads the data from the memory address specified by the read address and sets the valid data signal to indicate that the output data is valid. If none of the start, enabled or reset signals are asserted, it clears the done signal and the valid data signal.
