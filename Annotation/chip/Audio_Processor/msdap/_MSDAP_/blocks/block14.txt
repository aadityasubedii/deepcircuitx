This Verilog module, Hmem, functions as a memory block. Once enabled (via the 'en' input) and initiated with 'Start', it provides read and write operations to a memory array, MEM, which contains a total of 512 16-bit elements. Data can be written to it when the input 'wr' is set high, at address specified by 'wr_addr' and data provided through 'data_in'. Similarly, data is output from a specified 'rd_addr' when 'wr' is low. The module contains two indicators -- 'w_done' that goes high when a write operation is complete, and 'data_valid' indicating data on 'data_out' is valid to read. Module resets to initial state when 'rst' is high.
