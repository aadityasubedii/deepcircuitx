Comment: 
This block is responsible for receiving and transmitting data. Upon a start signal, it initializes variables: 'data' to a 40-bit zero, 'data_out' to a low signal, 'ybt' to a 6-bit zero, and 'word_sent' to a low signal. However, if the start signal is not present-on a rising clock edge-it assesses 'en' (enable). When 'en' is active, the block updates 'data' with 'data_in', increments 'ybt', sets 'data_out' by indexing 'data' at 'ybt', and sets 'word_sent' to a high signal once 'ybt' equals 40 (28 in hex), resetting 'ybt' to zero. If 'en' is not active, it simply resets 'word_sent' to a low signal.
