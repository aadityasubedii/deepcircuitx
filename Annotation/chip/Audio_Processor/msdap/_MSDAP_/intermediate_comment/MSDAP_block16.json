    "block_comment": "This block defines a memory module in Verilog, named RJmem. The module takes input signals such as enable, reset, write, start, and data input, as well as addresses for reading and writing. The module also has output signals for write completion, data validity, and data output. The functionality is implemented using an array of 16x16-bit memory locations, with register data types to store the output and working status. This design allows data to be written and read from specified memory addresses, and to signal when data is valid or a write operation is complete."
