    "block_comment": "This block is a multisource synchronous process in Verilog for state machine control flow. The control flow gets affected by input signals such as 'Reset', 'Start', 'Frame', 'word_ready', 'prev_OutReady', 'word_sent', and 'sleep'. At the start, if the 'Reset' is active, the system initializes its parameters, the state machine moves to 'state7', and several control signals are set to low. If 'Start' is active, it sets various control signals to low. In normal operation, the system works according to its current state, transitioning between different states based on the conditional statements tied to input signals. For instance, in state 'state6', the presence of a frame causes activation of 'Frame_edg', and if 'prev_OutReady' is active, 'PISO_en' and 'OutReady' are activated, among other actions. Other states have similar operations designed per requirements. If an invalid state is encountered, it sets several control signals to low as a fail-safe."
