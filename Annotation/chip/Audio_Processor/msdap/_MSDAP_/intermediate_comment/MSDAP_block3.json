    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a state machine with 9 different states (state0 to state8), which manages buffers and handles operations based on events such as Start, done_R, Reset, and different states. The block responds to the rising edge of Start and done_R signals, and falling edge of Reset signal. When Reset is low, buffer pointer for xw_ptr_buff_R is reset. For a Start signal, multiple buffer pointers and stop signals are reset. During other times the block enters into state machine operation. Depending on the current state identified by the next_state variable, various operations such as buffer pointer updates are performed. Some of the operations are conditional based on the values of R_clr_stop_R, X_clr_stop_R or sleep signals. The default case resets all the buffer pointers, and stop signals."
