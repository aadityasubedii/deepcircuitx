    "block_comment": "This module essentially functions as a finite state machine (FSM) that controls the hardware pointers and enables signals for data movement. It implements state logic effectively responding to certain input signals such as `Start`, `done_R`, and `Sclk`. Initially, with the `Start` signal, all the enable flags and pointers are reset. The same action occurs on receiving `done_R`. In steady state, based on the current `next_state` and specific conditions such as `word_ready`, the code updates the values of different types of pointers (`rw_ptr_R`, `hw_ptr_R`, `xw_ptr_R`) and control signals (`RJ_enR`, `H_enR`, `X_wr_enR`) for data manipulation."
