    "block_comment": "This block implements a Memory management unit that handles writing to and reading from memory. On receiving a start signal ('Start'), it resets 'data_out', 'w_done', and 'data_valid' signals. When enabled ('en'), it checks for a reset signal ('rst'). If 'rst' is high, it clears the memory at the address 'wr_addr' and sets the 'w_done' signal. In the absence of a reset, if a write signal ('wr') is high, it writes the incoming data ('data_in') to memory at 'wr_addr' and sets the 'w_done'. If 'wr' is not high, it reads the data from memory at 'rd_addr', outputs it via 'data_out' and sets 'data_valid'. Other scenarios reset the 'w_done' and 'data_valid'."
