    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a state machine, controlled by signals `Start`, `Reset`, `done_L`, and `next_state`. It primarily controls memory buffer pointers `xw_ptr_buff_L`, `rw_ptr_buff_L` and `hw_ptr_buff_L` as well as flags `R_clr_stop_L`, `X_clr_stop_L`, and `x_flagbit`. When `Reset` is active, it initializes memory pointers and flags. If `Start` is high, it resets these values. In the default operation mode, it updates these parameters depending on the current state, defined by `next_state`. In each state, different calculations about pointers and flags are carried out, containing conditions based on `sleep` status and certain threshold comparators. The pointers are typically incremented, except in specific states where they are either reset or kept at a constant, and flags are set/reset based on specific conditions."
