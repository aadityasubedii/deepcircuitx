    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the control logic for receiving and processing data. When either 'Reset' or 'rst' is active or on a negative edge of 'Dclk', the block initializes all outputs ('bt', 'data_out', 'word_ready') to their default values. If 'received' flag is high, the block clears the 'word_ready' flag, indicating processing of data and stops receiving further data. It then processes 'data_in' based on 'Frame_edg' and 'bt' conditions and increments 'bt'. When 'Frame_edg' is inactive, the block resets 'bt' and 'word_ready' to their default states."
