    "block_comment": "The block of code defines the module 'PISO' which is a parallel in serial out (PISO) shift register. The inputs to the module are `en`, `Sclk`, `Start` and a 40-bit data input `data_in`. The outputs from the module are `word_sent` and `data_out`. In the block, there is a 6-bit register `ybt` and another 40-bit register `data` defined for intermediate processing. The module performs the task of accepting 40 bits of parallel input and converting it into serial output, implementing a PISO functionality. This operation is primarily achieved by using `ybt` and `data` as additional registers and is driven by the input signals `en` (enable), `Sclk` (shift clock) and `Start`."
