It integrates various submodules including SIPO (Serial In Parallel Out), PISO (Parallel In Serial Out), memory blocks (RJmem, Hmem, Xmem), ALUs, and a controller. The system processes input data streams (InputL and InputR) through multiple stages of memory operations and arithmetic computations, ultimately producing output data streams (OutputL and OutputR). The controller manages the overall operation, coordinating data flow between different components and handling various control signals. The design seems to implement some form of audio or signal processing algorithm, likely involving filtering or transformation of the input data."
