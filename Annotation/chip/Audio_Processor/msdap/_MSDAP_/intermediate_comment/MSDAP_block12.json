    "block_comment": "This block defines a combinational always block that is sensitive to a write enable signal (wr_en), reset condition (Reset), or start command (Start). In Verilog RTL coding, the always block is where behavioral modeling occurs according to the specific condition. The function of this block is to react and execute the code within the block whenever a write enable signal, a reset condition, or a start command is detected. Its implementation involves awaiting changes in these three condition signals, responding instantly upon detecting any fluctuations, making it useful for controlling timing-related tasks."
