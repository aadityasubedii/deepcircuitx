    "block_comment": "This block is a state machine which controls the pointers 'rr_ptr_buff' and 'hr_ptr_buff' based on input signals. The block will reset the pointers 'rr_ptr_buff' and 'hr_ptr_buff' to zero if 'Reset' is active or 'Start' is high. If both Reset and Start signals are de-asserted, it moves to the next state depending on the validity signals 'r_valid' and 'h_valid'. If 'r_valid' is high, it increments 'rr_ptr_buff' by one. If 'h_valid' is high, it increments 'hr_ptr_buff' by one. The control flow is maintained using event-driven always block, which is sensitive to the negative edge of Reset and positive edges of both 'valid' and 'Start' signals."
