    "block_comment": "This block defines logic to manage the computation states of a system by utilizing a state machine architecture. The system cycles through initial, computation, and sleep states based on system control signals. Initially, overflow indicators are reset, and if the compute_enable signal is high, the system transitions to the computation state. In the computation state, count values are incremented, and overflow is flagged if count exceeds a threshold. The system can then transition to a sleep state if a designated sleep_flag signal is asserted. In the sleep state, if the sleep_flag is low, computation resumes. At all times, a signal named Clear can reset the system to its initial state."
