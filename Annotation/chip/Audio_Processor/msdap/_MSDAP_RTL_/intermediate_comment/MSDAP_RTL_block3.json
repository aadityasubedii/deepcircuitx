    "block_comment": "The module \"adder\" functions as an adder/subtractor entity as defined by the control signal 'add_sub'. When 'add_sub' is '1', it performs subtraction, while if 'add_sub' is '0', it performs addition. This functionality is controlled by conditional operator in Verilog, '?' and ':'. This implementation uses a 40-bit-wide input for 'a' and 'b', determined by the input bit width [39:0]. The final result is stored in 'sum'. The operation is enabled or disabled using the control signal 'adder_en'."
