    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the state transition in a state machine system. Specifically, it utilizes a conditional statement to check the status of a signal called 'Clear'. If 'Clear' is set to 1, the present state (pr_state_R) is reset to 'initial_state'. Otherwise, it assigns the 'next_state_R' to the present state. This way, it offers a mechanism to either reset the state or to move to the next state, depending on the control signal."
