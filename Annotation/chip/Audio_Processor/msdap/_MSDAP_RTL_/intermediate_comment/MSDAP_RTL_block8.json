    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is essentially a finite state machine with three states: initial_state, comp_state, and sleep_state. Upon every positive edge of the system clock, it transitions to a state based on several conditional checks. The initial_state is the reset state which is switched to either by a reset ('Clear' signal) or enable computation ('compute_enable' signal). The comp_state is for computation, increasing the 'x_count_L', triggering start of computation if 'compute_enable' is set, and checking for memory overflow. The state machine goes into sleep_state when 'sleep_flag' is set, where no computation takes place until sleep mode is turned off. In all states, provision is included to prevent overflow by monitoring if 'x_count_L' reaches its maximum count (0xFF in hexadecimal)."
