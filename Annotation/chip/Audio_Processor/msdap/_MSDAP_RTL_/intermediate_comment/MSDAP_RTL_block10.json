    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the data from a coefficient memory unit. The operation relies on the value of the 'rd_en' signal; when this signal is high (true), the data from the coefficient memory position indicated by 'coeff_rd_addr' address is assigned to the 'coeff_data'. If the 'rd_en' signal is low (false), a zero value (16'd0) is assigned to the 'coeff_data'. This conditional data assignment provides the functionality of read control of the coefficient memory."
