    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code defines a synchronous circuit for handling InputL and InputR data stream with clear and framing functionality. On a high input 'Clear' signal, the code resets variables including the 'bit_count', 'data_L', 'data_R', 'input_rdy_flag', and 'frame_status'. Otherwise, if 'Frame' signal is high, the left and right input data values are stored in 'data_L' and 'data_R' at the index of 'bit_count' respectively, and 'frame_status' is set to high. When 'frame_status' is high and 'Frame' is low, 'bit_count' decreases by 1, and the input data is again stored under the new 'bit_count' index. When 'bit_count' reaches 0, 'input_rdy_flag' is set high and 'frame_status' is reset, signalling the end of the frame. In all other cases, the variables are reset."
