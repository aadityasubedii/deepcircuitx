    "block_comment": "This block assigns a selected value from the 'rj_mem' memory to 'rj_data'. The assignment is controlled by the 'rd_en' signal. If 'rd_en' is high, the value at the memory location 'rj_rd_addr' from 'rj_mem' is assigned to 'rj_data'. Otherwise, if 'rd_en' is low, 'rj_data' is assigned as 16'd0 or zero."
