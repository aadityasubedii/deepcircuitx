    "block_comment": "The block is a memory module for storing coefficients. It takes inputs for write-enable (wr_en), read-enable (rd_en), system clock (Sclk), write address (coeff_wr_addr), read address (coeff_rd_addr), and input data (data_in). The output data is coefficient data (coeff_data). The memory module achieves its function by registering a 16-bit wide, 512-deep block memory (coeff_mem) to store coefficients which can be accessed for reading or writing."
