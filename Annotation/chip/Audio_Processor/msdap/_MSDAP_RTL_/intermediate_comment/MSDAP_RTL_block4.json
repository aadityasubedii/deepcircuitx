    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code primarily manages computations and output enabling based on computation statuses and counter values. It appears to operate on a sequential logic and run following a system clock. The block starts with an 'if' statement checking for the 'out_done_R' condition, if true, it initializes several registers and sets p2s_enable_R. Note that this code implements a computation and control flow procedure. Depending on the statuses 'start_comp_R' and 'compute_status_R', distinct operations are triggered: initialization, enabling and disabling computations, updating addresses in memory, managing overflow and incrementing or resetting counters."
