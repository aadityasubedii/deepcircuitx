    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating the data memory in a memory module on negative edge of the clock signal. If write enable signal (wr_en) is asserted, the content at the memory address specified by data_wr_addr is updated with the data input (data_in). If not, the state of the memory at that address remains untouched."
