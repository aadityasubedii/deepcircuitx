    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the writing operation of `coeff_mem` memory module. When write enable signal (`wr_en`) goes high at the negative edge of system clock (`Sclk`), input data (`data_in`) is written to the memory location addressed by `coeff_wr_addr`. If `wr_en` is low, the memory content remains unchanged at the respective address."
