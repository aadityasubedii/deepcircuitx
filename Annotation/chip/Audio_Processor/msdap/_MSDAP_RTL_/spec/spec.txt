Module name: shift_acc. Module specification: The shift_acc module implements a 40-bit shift accumulator with load, clear, and shift functionalities. It has input ports for shift_enable (controls shifting), load (enables loading new data), clear (resets accumulator), sclk (clock input), and blk_in[39:0] (40-bit input data). The output port is blk_out[39:0] (40-bit output data). Internally, it uses a 40-bit register shift_acc_reg to store and manipulate data. The module's main block is a synchronous always block triggered on the positive edge of sclk. This block handles clearing the accumulator, loading new data with optional shifting, and maintaining the current value based on input signals. The module can perform right shifts when enabled, making it suitable for digital signal processing applications that require accumulation and shifting operations.
