Module-level comment: This module implements a 40-bit shift accumulator with load, clear, and shift operations. It uses a 40-bit register to store data, updating on each clock cycle based on control signals. The module can load new data, clear the accumulator, or perform right shifts, making it suitable for digital signal processing applications requiring accumulation and shifting operations.
