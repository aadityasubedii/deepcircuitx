This block of Verilog code operates a state machine running at every rising edge of system clock (Sclk) that manages a computation process. When the 'out_done_L' signal is high, it resets key variables and enables 'p2s_enable_L.' Then it checks for the start signal 'start_comp_L', where if it's high, it initializes variables to perform computations. If 'compute_status_L' is also high, it performs various computations and assignments, determining whether to shift, load, or add and increment addresses based on the value of 'k_L' and 'rj_data_L.' Whenever 'rj_addr_L' reaches 15, it resets and declares output done. In the deeper conditions, it focuses on computing 'xin_addr_L' variable with different conditions and manipulating the 'coeff_addr_L' and 'k_L' variables. Constant refresh/reset condition checks ensure the computation is ready for new tasks when none of the aforesaid conditions is true.
