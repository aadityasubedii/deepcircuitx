This block of code manages the write operation to a memory unit called rj_mem. The write operation occurs on the falling edge (negedge) of the system clock (Sclk). If the write enable signal (wr_en) is high, data read from the data input (data_in) is written into the memory location with address specified by rj_wr_addr. Otherwise, no actual changes are made to the memory, preserving the data already at that address.
