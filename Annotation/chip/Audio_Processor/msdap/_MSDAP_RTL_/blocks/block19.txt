Comment: 
This block implements a state transition mechanism in a finite state machine, sensitive to the negative edges of `Sclk` (usually designating a system clock) and `Reset_n` signals. Upon a negative edge, if the `Reset_n` signal is low (implying reset state), it checks whether the current state (`pr_state`) is beyond `4â€™d4` and if so, resets the state to `Reset`. Otherwise, it transits to `next_state`. In case `Reset_n` is high, it directly transitions to `next_state`.
