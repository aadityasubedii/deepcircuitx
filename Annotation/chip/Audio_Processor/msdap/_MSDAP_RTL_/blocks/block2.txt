This block defines a module for a Serial-In-Parallel-Out (SIPO) shift register, it processes serial input from two sources (InputL and InputR) and converts it to parallel output (data_L, data_R). It operates on a given FPGA frame, with amounts of data defined by a bit count and managed by a data clock (Dclk) and a clear signal. Additionally, it uses a frame_status register to track the ongoing operation and signals readiness to accept new input through 'input_rdy_flag', which is modified within the module context.
