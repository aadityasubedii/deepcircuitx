This module serves as a controller for MSDAP (Multi-stage decimation filter for Audio Processing). It manages the data read and write addresses for different data types - rj, coeff and data, synchronizes clock signals, manages states, and provides computation and sleep flags. The function is implemented using a state machine, cycling states between startup, waiting states, reading states, computation, reset, and sleep. The 'pr_state' and 'next_state' registers ensure proper state transition. Counters are implemented for real, rj, coeff and data components for accurate processing of each type. The 'Frame_out', 'Dclk_out', 'Sclk_out' outputs directly mirror their input counterparts for synchronization.
