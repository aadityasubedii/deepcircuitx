The block of code functions as a definition for a clock signal with a certain period, specifically 'Dclk'. This is achieved by using an 'always' block which contains a timing control expression. This timing control expression, '#(Dclk_period/2)', denotes that the Dclk signal should be toggled (i.e. its value is inverted) every 'Dclk_period/2' time units. That means the clock period of the Dclk is 'Dclk_period' which makes the frequency '1/Dclk_period'.
