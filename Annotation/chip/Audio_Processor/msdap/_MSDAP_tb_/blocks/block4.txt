This block of code regulates the frame generation and data organization for a system with a data matrix, managed by a clock signal (Dclk). At every positive edge of the clock, if input is ready (InReady), the frame status and data inputs (InputL and InputR) are updated based on the indices j and k. For the first data in each round, a new frame begins, and ends for the second data. The indices increment until they reach the end of two consecutive data lines (when k equals 16), after which they reset; at this time, a mid-point count is also calculated. Additionally, at certain specific values of j, a reset sequence is performed, setting relevant signals back to their default and indicating the end of a frame.
