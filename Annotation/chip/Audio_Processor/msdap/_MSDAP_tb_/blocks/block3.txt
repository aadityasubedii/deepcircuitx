The block of code serves to buffer and write output data when ready. Triggered at the rising edge of Sclk, it initially stores the state of OutReady into OutReady_buff. Upon detection of OutReady_buff's high state (1'b1), the block stores the values of OutputL and OutputR into an array 'out_data' according to an index 'ybt'. This index is then incremented. When it reaches 40, the block formats and writes the contents of 'out_data' into a file, and resets 'ybt' back to 0.
