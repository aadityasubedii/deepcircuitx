    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for generating a clock signal. It does so by leveraging the Verilog delay syntax '#', which causes the code to wait for a specified amount of simulated time before executing the next line. Here, the system clock period `Sclk_period` is divided by two to imitate the positive and negative phases of a clock, essentially generating a continuous clock signal by toggling the value of `Sclk` between 0 and 1 at every half-period interval."
