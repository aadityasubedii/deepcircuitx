    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe 'PLL' module is for instantiation of an Altera PLL IP core, useful for frequency stabilization, multiplication and phase synchronization tasks. It utilizes two inputs - 'areset' for an asynchronous reset, and 'inclk0' as a reference clock. The module generates an output clock 'c0' in phase with the input, and a 'locked' status signal. Internal wiring helps manage signals in conjunction with the altpll component and a 'defparam' block allows configuration of various PLL features. The module serves as a configurable wrapper for the Altera PLL IP core, adaptable for different use-cases."
