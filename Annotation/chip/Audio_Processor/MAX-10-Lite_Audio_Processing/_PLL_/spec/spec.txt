Module name: PLL. 

Module specification: 

The 'PLL' module is a design for instantiating a phase-locked loop (PLL) using an Altera IP core "altpll". A PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal, providing functionalities like frequency stabilization, frequency multiplication, phase synchronization and data recovery.

This module comprises of two input ports 'areset' and 'inclk0'. 'areset' is an asynchronous reset input which resets the PLL when it goes high. 'inclk0' is the reference clock input for the PLL serving as the base frequency reference.

The output ports are 'c0' and 'locked'. 'c0' is the main output clock signal, generated by the PLL and locked to the frequency/phase of the input clock. 'locked' is a status signal indicating if the PLL has achieved lock to the input clock.

Internally, it utilizes several temporary wires namely 'sub_wire2', 'sub_wire3', 'sub_wire5', 'sub_wire0', 'sub_wire1', 'sub_wire4' to manage and propagate signals. For example, 'sub_wire1' concatenates 'sub_wire2' and 'sub_wire0' to form a 2-bit input to the altpll component.

The different sections of the code are majorly the wiring definitions, the altpll component instantiation and the 'defparam' block. The wiring definitions are used to prepare the necessary signals for the altpll component. The altpll component instantiation is where these wires are passed as inputs or extracted as outputs. The 'defparam' block is a set of configuration for the altpll component parameters such as the input frequency, multiply factor, and divide factor among others.

The PLL module is therefore a configuration box for an altpll component where the input/output ports and parameters can be set to suit specific applications.
