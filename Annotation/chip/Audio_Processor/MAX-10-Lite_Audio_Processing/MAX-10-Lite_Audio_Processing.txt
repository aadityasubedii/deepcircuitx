The MAX-10-Lite_Audio_Processing repository is designed for comprehensive handling of audio signals, utilizing FPGA technology for efficient decoding, processing, and encoding of audio streams. The repository hosts an array of modules that are interconnected to deliver a robust audio processing system. These include modules for decoding I2S audio into separate left and right channels, re-encoding processed audio back into I2S format, managing audio synchronization via PLL and clock division, and implementing audio effects such as clipping and echo determined by user-controlled switches. The top-level module, 'audio_top', synergizes these functionalities, using system clocks and controls to route the audio data through various processing stages and outputting through specific GPIO ports. Additionally, parameterization across these modules allows adjustment of operations like audio resolution and processing depth, enabling customization to fit specific audio processing needs. This setup is aimed at providing a scalable and configurable audio processing environment on the Altera MAX-10 FPGA, suitable for both educational purposes and practical applications in digital audio technology.
