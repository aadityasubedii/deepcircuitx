When a clock signal is received on the rising edge, the current data in `data_hold` is moved to `data_out` and new input data from `data_in` is stored in `data_hold`.

When a rising edge of the `clk` signal is detected, the module transfers the current data in `data_hold` to `data_out` and stores new input data from `data_in` in `data_hold`. The `data_in` is the input data which is to be stored and held until the next clock cycle.\n\nOutput ports: `data_out`. \nExplanation: `data_out` is the output port where data from `data_hold` register gets transferred. This data is then available for other modules or entities connected to the `data_out` port.

At the clock's positive edge, the contents of `data_hold` are moved to the output `data_out` and `data_hold` then gets updated with the new `data_in`.
