    "spec": "Module name: bypass. Module specification: The bypass module is designed as a simple register that holds and transfers data. This module's primary function is to implement a one cycle delay storage unit for the incoming data. It gets activated on the rising edge clock signal, transferring data from the internal `data_hold` register to the `data_out` port and updating `data_hold` with new data from `data_in` port. The inputs to this module are `clk`, which drives the storage operation and `data_in`, that presents the incoming data to be stored. The module has one output port `data_out`, which makes the data available for other entities or modules outside of the bypass module, following a delay of one clock cycle. The module uses an internal signal `data_hold`, a register that momentarily stores the incoming data until the arrival of the next clock cycle signal. The Verilog code of the module outlines the setup of input, output ports and internal registers with an 'always' block handling the data storage and transfer operations based on the arrival of `clk` signal's positive edge.",
