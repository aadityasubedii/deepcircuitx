    "block_comment": "This block of code is a data transfer block designed to move and latch data from an input to an output after every clock cycle. Upon a positive edge of the clock signal, the current contents of the 'data_hold' register are transferred to 'data_out', and concurrently, the newest input data from 'data_in' is latched into 'data_hold' for the next cycle. The use of non-blocking assignments ensures the concurrent updating of these registers."
