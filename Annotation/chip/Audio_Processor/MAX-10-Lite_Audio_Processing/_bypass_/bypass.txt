Module-level comment: The 'bypass' module is a one cycle delay storage unit. It uses a clock signal (`clk`) and an input data (`data_in`). On each positive `clk` edge, the data in `data_in` is stored in an internal register `data_hold` and the existing data in `data_hold` moves to `data_out`. Therefore, `data_out` effectively represents the incoming data after a delay of one clock cycle. Implementing this register-based data transfer approach maintains a constant delay of data for synchronization in larger systems.
