Module-level comment: The 'audio_top' module is a hardware design for processing audio data. It utilizes system clock (SYS_CLK), audio data (GPIO3), and switch control signals (SW) as inputs and generates clocks using a PLL and clock dividers. The generated clocks control the decoding of I2S audio data, its processing through effects, and re-encoding back into I2S format. The final audio data is output through GPIO4, with the processed left channel data status displayed on an LED array (LEDR).
