These clocks synchronize the decoding of incoming I2S audio data and controlling its processing effects. The processed and re-encoded audio data is output through a GPIO pin (GPIO4), and the status of processed left channel data is displayed using a 10-bit LED array (LEDR).\n\nThe internal signals of the module include: \n1. MCLK - Master Clock.\n2. LRCK - Left Right Clock for distinguishing the left and right channel data signals.\n3. SCLK - Serial Clock controlling the timing of data transfers.\n4. Data_clk - used for data timing after division operation on SCLK.\n5. \"Locked\" - a Boolean signal indicating if the Phase Locked Loop has been successful.\n6. \"Reset\" signal - used for reset operations.\n7. \"Effects_L_out\" and \"effects_R_out\" signals - output of the processing effects modules for the left and right channels respectively.\n\nThe module block can be divided into clock generation, decoders, encoders, effects, and flip-flops handling individual tasks. The clocks provide timing signals for data decoding, processing, and encoding. The \"i2s_decode\" block decodes incoming I2S data. Then, the \"effects\" block applies certain processing effects.
