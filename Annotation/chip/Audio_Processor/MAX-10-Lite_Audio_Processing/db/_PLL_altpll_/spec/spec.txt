Module name: PLL_altpll. 

Module specification: The PLL_altpll module, which stands for a Phase Locked Loop circuit specifically an "altpll" circuit, is a hardware module designed to generate a clock signal of a different frequency from an input clock. The module takes an input clock (inclk), a 2-bit wide clock signal, and an asynchronous reset signal (areset) as inputs. It generates an output clock signal (clk), a 5-bit wide signal, and a 'locked' binary signal indicating whether the PLL output frequency has been locked. The main functionality of the circuit is implemented using the 'fiftyfivenm_pll' module that generates this new clock frequency according to custom defined parameters. To handle the synchronization of the 'locked' signal and the asynchronous reset operation, 'pll_lock_sync' register is utilized within the module. The module also contains internal signals such as 'wire_pll1_clk', 'wire_pll1_fbout', 'wire_pll1_locked' which are part of the 'fiftyfivenm_pll' module ensuring appropriate frequency generation and the correct functioning of the feedback mechanism. The code is largely classified into declaration, instantiation and assignment blocks. You specify custom parameters to the 'fiftyfivenm_pll' module using the 'defparam' section, and assign the outputs in the assignment block. The module assists in highly adjustable digital logic design requirements and microchip clock generation utilizing Phase Locked Loop.
