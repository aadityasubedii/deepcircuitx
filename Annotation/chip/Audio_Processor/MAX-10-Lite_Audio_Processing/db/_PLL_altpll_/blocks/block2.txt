Comment: 
This block is responsible for synchronizing the lock of Phase Locked Loop (PLL). It is conditionally triggered either on the positive edge of `wire_pll1_locked` or the positive edge of `areset`. In its functionality, it applies a reset logic; if `areset` is high, the `pll_lock_sync` signal is reset to 0, ensuring unlocking of the PLL. Otherwise, the `pll_lock_sync` is set to 1, indicating that the PLL has achieved lock. This method allows synchronizing the PLL lock condition with respect to the `areset` signal or `wire_pll1_locked`.
