This block initializes the 'pll_lock_sync' signal to 0 at the start of simulation. The 'initial' keyword in Verilog is used for setting initial conditions in simulation models; it doesn't synthesize to actual hardware. Here, it is used for setting the initial value of the 'pll_lock_sync' signal to 0, ensuring it's in a known state at the start of simulation, offering greater predictability for subsequent behaviors.
