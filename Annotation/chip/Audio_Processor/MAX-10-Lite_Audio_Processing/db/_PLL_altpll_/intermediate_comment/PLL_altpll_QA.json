            "content": "Name of the module and its functionality is as follows: \nModule name: PLL_altpll\n\nExplanation: This module is named \"PLL_altpll\" which represents a Phase Locked Loop circuit specifically an \"altpll\" circuit, used commonly for generating a clock signal with a different frequency from an input clock. This module takes an input clock (inclk) and an asynchronous reset signal (areset), and outputs a clock of new frequency (clk) and a 'locked' signal. It uses a digital implementation of Phase Locked Loop (PLL) synthesized via a module named \"fiftyfivenm_pll\". This design allows the specification of custom properties to the instantiated module resulting in a custom frequency output according to the specified parameters ( such as clk0_divide_by and clk0_multiply_by parameters ). The module utilizes synchronous reset for the locked signal with the reset condition driven by areset or changes in the phase lock. This locked signal is conjointly driven by 'pll_lock_sync' and 'wire_pll1_locked'. The output clock is derived from wire_pll1_clk, which is the clock output from the PLL instance.\nThis is a useful yet complex module which aids in microchip clock generation via a phase-locked loop which is highly customizable to fit numerous digital logic design requirements."
