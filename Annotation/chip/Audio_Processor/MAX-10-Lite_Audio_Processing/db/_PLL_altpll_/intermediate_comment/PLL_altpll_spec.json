    "spec": "Module name: PLL_altpll. \n\nModule specification: The PLL_altpll module, which stands for a Phase Locked Loop circuit specifically an \"altpll\" circuit, is a hardware module designed to generate a clock signal of a different frequency from an input clock. The module takes an input clock (inclk), a 2-bit wide clock signal, and an asynchronous reset signal (areset) as inputs. It generates an output clock signal (clk), a 5-bit wide signal, and a 'locked' binary signal indicating whether the PLL output frequency has been locked. The main functionality of the circuit is implemented using the 'fiftyfivenm_pll' module that generates this new clock frequency according to custom defined parameters. To handle the synchronization of the 'locked' signal and the asynchronous reset operation, 'pll_lock_sync' register is utilized within the module. The module also contains internal signals such as 'wire_pll1_clk', 'wire_pll1_fbout', 'wire_pll1_locked' which are part of the 'fiftyfivenm_pll' module ensuring appropriate frequency generation and the correct functioning of the feedback mechanism. The code is largely classified into declaration, instantiation and assignment blocks. You specify custom parameters to the 'fiftyfivenm_pll' module using the 'defparam' section, and assign the outputs in the assignment block.

This module takes an input clock (inclk) and an asynchronous reset signal (areset), and outputs a clock of new frequency (clk) and a 'locked' signal. It uses a digital implementation of Phase Locked Loop (PLL) synthesized via a module named \"fiftyfivenm_pll\". This design allows the specification of custom properties to the instantiated module resulting in a custom frequency output according to the specified parameters ( such as clk0_divide_by and clk0_multiply_by parameters ). The module utilizes synchronous reset for the locked signal with the reset condition driven by areset or changes in the phase lock. This locked signal is conjointly driven by 'pll_lock_sync' and 'wire_pll1_locked'. The output clock is derived from wire_pll1_clk, which is the clock output from the PLL instance.\nThis is a useful yet complex module which aids in microchip clock generation via a phase-locked loop which is highly customizable to fit numerous digital logic design requirements."
