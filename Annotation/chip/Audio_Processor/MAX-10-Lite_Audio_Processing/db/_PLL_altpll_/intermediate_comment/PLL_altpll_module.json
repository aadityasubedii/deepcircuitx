    "module": "Module-level comment: The PLL_altpll module generates a new clock frequency from an input clock using Phase Locked Loop (PLL) synthesis. It takes in a 2-bit input clock (inclk) and an asynchronous reset signal (areset), outputting a 5-bit clock frequency (clk) and a 'locked' signal. It internally uses 'fiftyfivenm_pll' for clock generation with custom parameters, while 'pll_lock_sync' helps synchronize the 'locked' signal with the asynchronous reset. Internal signals like 'wire_pll1_clk', 'wire_pll1_fbout', 'wire_pll1_locked' form part of the PLL mechanism implementation. The module is suitable for versatile digital logic design requirements."
