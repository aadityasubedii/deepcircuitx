    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns values to the clk and locked variables. The clk value is assigned the bits from positions 4 to 0 (inclusive) from the wire_pll1_clk logic wire, making it a subset of wire_pll1_clk values. Concurrently, the locked value is calculated as a logical AND operation between the wire_pll1_locked and pll_lock_sync signals, meaning it will be true only when both signals are true. This serves as a synchronization mechanism, ensuring that the system is functioning within the expected parameters."
