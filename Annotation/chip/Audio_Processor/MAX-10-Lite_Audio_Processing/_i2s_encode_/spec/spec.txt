Module name: i2s_encode. 

Module specification: 
The 'i2s_encode' module is a hardware module which is designed to process and encode incoming data streams into the I2S (Inter-IC Sound) audio format. It accepts four inputs, namely - 'SCLK', 'LRCK', 'data_in_L', and 'data_in_R', and has one output, 'data_out'. 'SCLK' is the system clock and controls the timing of transitions. 'LRCK' is the left or right clock that determines from which channel the data should be selected. 'data_in_L' and 'data_in_R' are the input data streams from the left and right audio channels respectively. 'data_out' is the output port that sends out the selected and processed data. The module utilizes several internal signals including a 32-bit register 'count', a buffer 'data_buf', and a register 'LR'. The 'count' keeps track of the system clock falling edges. The 'data_buf' stores the current input data from either the left or right channel. The 'LR' stores the value of LRCK and indicates the channel from which data is taken. The main blocks include an always block that is triggered on the falling edge of the system clock where the count is incremented, LRCK is compared to LR to check if there needs to be a channel change, and the data_out is set based on the count and resolution. This design allows fast and efficient encoding of incoming audio data streams into the I2S format.
