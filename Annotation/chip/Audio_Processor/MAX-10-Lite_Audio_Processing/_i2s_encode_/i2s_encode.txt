Module-level comment: The 'i2s_encode' module encodes data into I2S format. It uses 'SCLK' for timing control, and 'LRCK' to toggle between left ('data_in_L') and right ('data_in_R') input data. The 'LR' register checks for channel changes while 'count' tracks SCLK edges. The 'data_buf' stores data from selected channel, from which 'data_out' is set. This is managed within an always block, triggered by the negedge of SCLK, ensuring fast and efficient encoding.
