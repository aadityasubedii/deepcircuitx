The module takes in parameters including the system clock (SCLK), left or right clock (LRCK), and data input from both left and right channels (data_in_L, data_in_R). According to the I2S protocol, the data from either left or right channel is selected based on the state of the LRCK signal, that is when LRCK is 0 it chooses data from the left channel otherwise from the right channel. The selected data is stored in a buffer (data_buf). The counter increases with each falling edge of the system clock until it equals the resolution. The data_out is then taken from the data buffer according to the position defined by the difference between the resolution and the count. When the LRCK changes, the counter resets, and the data buffer is refilled with the corresponding channel data."
