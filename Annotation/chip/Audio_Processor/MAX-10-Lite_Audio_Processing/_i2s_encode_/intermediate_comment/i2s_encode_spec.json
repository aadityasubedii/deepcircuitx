    "spec": "Module name: i2s_encode. \n\nModule specification: \nThe 'i2s_encode' module is a hardware module which is designed to process and encode incoming data streams into the I2S (Inter-IC Sound) audio format. It accepts four inputs, namely - 'SCLK', 'LRCK', 'data_in_L', and 'data_in_R', and has one output, 'data_out'. 'SCLK' is the system clock and controls the timing of transitions. 'LRCK' is the left or right clock that determines from which channel the data should be selected. 'data_in_L' and 'data_in_R' are the input data streams from the left and right audio channels respectively. 'data_out' is the output port that sends out the selected and processed data. The module utilizes several internal signals including a 32-bit register 'count', a buffer 'data_buf', and a register 'LR'. The 'count' keeps track of the system clock falling edges. The 'data_buf' stores the current input data from either the left or right channel. The 'LR' stores the value of LRCK and indicates the channel from which data is taken. The main blocks include an always block that is triggered on the falling edge of the system clock where the count is incremented, LRCK is compared to LR to check if there needs to be a channel change, and the data_out is set based on the count and resolution. This design allows fast and efficient encoding of incoming audio data streams into the I2S format.",

The module takes in parameters including the system clock (SCLK), left or right clock (LRCK), and data input from both left and right channels (data_in_L, data_in_R). According to the I2S protocol, the data from either left or right channel is selected based on the state of the LRCK signal, that is when LRCK is 0 it chooses data from the left channel otherwise from the right channel. The selected data is stored in a buffer (data_buf). The counter increases with each falling edge of the system clock until it equals the resolution. The data_out is then taken from the data buffer according to the position defined by the difference between the resolution and the count. When the LRCK changes, the counter resets, and the data buffer is refilled with the corresponding channel data."
