    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'i2s_decode' module decodes I2S audio data, producing two separate audio streams for left and right channels. It uses an 'always' block triggered by SCLK's rising edge and conditionals inside to handle bit accumulation, channel switch detection, and data output. Inputs include SCLK, LRCK, and data_in while outputs are data_out_L and data_out_R. It employs internal registers count, LR, data_L, and data_R for operation control. The audio sample's resolution is adjustable via the RESOLUTION parameter."
