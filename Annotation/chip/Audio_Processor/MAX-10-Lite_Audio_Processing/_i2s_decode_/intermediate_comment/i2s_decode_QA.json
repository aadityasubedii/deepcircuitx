It takes in the Serial Clock (SCLK), Left/Right Clock (LRCK), and audio data input (data_in) and outputs two streams of data, one for the left channel (data_out_L) and one for the right channel (data_out_R). SCLK, LRCK, and the data are processed to extract left and right channel data from the input stream and put them into separate registers. When the LRCK changes, it indicates that a complete cycle of left and right channel data is received, the counters are reset, and the accumulated data for both channels is put out to the respective output registers. If the LRCK does not change, it indicates that the system is in the middle of receiving data for one of the channels. It separates this data based on the state of LRCK (0 for left channel, 1 for right channel) and assembles it in a bit-wise manner into the corresponding data registers. The number of bits in each audio sample is determined by the parameter RESOLUTION."

It differentiates between left and right channel audio data.\n- data_in: This is the input audio data line which transmits the audio data bit-by-bit.\n\nOutput ports: data_out_L, data_out_R. \nExplanation: \n- data_out_L: This output port corresponds to the decoded audio data for the Left channel.\n- data_out_R: This output corresponds to the decoded audio data for the Right channel."

It increments with every rising edge of the SCLK until a complete set of audio data (as specified by the RESOLUTION parameter) is received for a channel. When the LR switches value, indicating the switch from one channel's data to the other's, the count is reset to 0.\n\n- LR: This is a register used to store the last received state of LRCK. Its main function is to determine if a switch from one channel to another has occurred. If the incoming LRCK is different from LR, then it implies a switch has happened from either left to right channel or vice versa.\n\n- data_L: This register accumulates the incoming bits associated with the Left channel audio data. Bits are accumulated in accordance with the SCLK. When a full set of bits is accumulated (RESOLUTION bits), the data is cascaded to the output (data_out_L) when the next channel (Right channel) starts.\n\n- data_R: This is the equivalent register to data_L but for the Right channel.
