Module name: PLL. 

Module Specification: The module named PLL, short for Phase Locked Loop, is a key component in digital designs, normally used for generating an output signal whose phase relates to the phase of the input signal. This module has two defined inputs and two outputs. The input ports include 'areset', a reset port that typically resets the state of the module to its initial parameters, and 'inclk0', an input clock signal port that paces the operations of the module in synchronization with other sections of the design. The output ports are 'c0' and 'locked', both of which remain undefined in the code, but in a typical PLL context, 'c0' could represent an output clock with varying frequency or phase, while 'locked' could signal a successful phase or frequency sync with the input signal. In the provided Verilog code, no internal signals are defined or used explicitly, thereby leaving the internal workings of this module unclear. The code includes some unused blocks (empty `ifndef ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS) for conditional compilation depending on the definition of ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS, however, they are currently empty and do not affect the module's operation.
