    "module": "Module-level comment: The PLL (Phase Locked Loop) module, typically used for maintaining phase relationship between input and output signals, includes input ports 'areset' for resetting module state, and 'inclk0' for input clock signal. Output ports 'c0' and 'locked' potentially represent output clock and lock signal respectively, although their exact roles are not specified. No internal signals or logic defined. Unused conditional compilation blocks present with `ifndef ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS tags."
