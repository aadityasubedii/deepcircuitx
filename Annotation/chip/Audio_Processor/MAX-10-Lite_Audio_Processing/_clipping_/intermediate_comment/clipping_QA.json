If the 'enable' flag is not set, the data output simply mirrors the data input without any modifications. The parameters 'RESOLUTION' and 'SHIFT' determine the width of the data signal to be processed and the scale of the left shift operation respectively. A part of the input 'data_in' is also clipped based on 'SHIFT' before shifting when the 'enable' signal is high. This module effectively allows data scaling when enabled."
