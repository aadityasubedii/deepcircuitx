    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a synchronous operation controlled by a clock signal. The function is primarily for conditional data shift and transfer. The operation of the block depends on the 'enable' signal. If the 'enable' signal is OFF (0), the input data 'data_in' is directly transferred to the output 'data_out'. When 'enable' signal is ON (1), this block computes the logical OR function on specific bits of the input data, assigns it to certain bits of the output data, and then performs a left shift operation on the input data by 'SHIFT' positions and assigns the result to 'data_out'. This piece of RTL Verilog code essentially performs conditional left shift and OR operations with capability of direct data transfer."
