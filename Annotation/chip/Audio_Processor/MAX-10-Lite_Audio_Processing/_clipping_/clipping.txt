Module-level comment: The 'clipping' module scales the 'data_in' based on the 'enable' signal. When 'enable' is high, a portion of 'data_in' is clipped and then the entire 'data_in' is left-shifted as defined by 'SHIFT', creating 'data_out'. Conversely, if 'enable' is low, 'data_in' is passed through as 'data_out'. The module operates synchronously with the 'clk' signal.
