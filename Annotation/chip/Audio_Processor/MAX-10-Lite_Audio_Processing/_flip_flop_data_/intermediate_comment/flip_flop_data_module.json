    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, named 'flip_flop_data', functions as a simple 1-cycle delay. It uses the 'data_hold' internal signal to temporarily hold the 'data_in' value until the next positive-edge clock cycle. On each clock cycle, the current 'data_in' becomes the 'data_out' for the next cycle, implementing a shift-register-like operation. Inputs are 'clk' (the clock signal) and 'data_in' (input data), and the module outputs 'data_out', which is a delayed version of 'data_in'."
