It uses the clock signal to manage the exchange of data. Upon each positive-edge clock cycle, it assigns the value of the 'data_hold' register to the 'data_out', and the 'data_in' to 'data_hold'. It seems to function as a simple 1-cycle delay or pipeline stage; whatever was received as 'data_in' in the current cycle is output as 'data_out' in the next cycle."
