    "spec": "Module name: flip_flop_data. \n\nModule specification: The 'flip_flop_data' module acts as a flip flop, providing a simple 1-cycle delay or pipeline stage. At every positive edge of the clock pulse, it assigns the 'data_hold' register's value to the 'data_out' and the 'data_in' value to the 'data_hold'. This action ultimately assures that whatever input is received ('data_in') in the current cycle is transmitted as the output ('data_out') in the next cycle. The module has two input ports: 'clk', which is the clock signal used to trigger data exchange; and 'data_in', a data input which will be delayed by one clock cycle due to the flip flop mechanism. There is also an output port, 'data_out', which delivers the 'data_in' value from the previous cycle. Internally, the module utilizes a 'data_hold' signal that functions as a temporary holder for the 'data_in' during the current cycle, transferring said value to 'data_out' in the next cycle, thereby creating the 1-cycle delay. The provided code for this module can be broken into two key sections: parameter and input/output declaration, and the logic block under 'always'. The first section defines the module parameters, input/output ports, and the internal signal. The second section, under 'always @(posedge clk)', holds the main flip flop logic.",
