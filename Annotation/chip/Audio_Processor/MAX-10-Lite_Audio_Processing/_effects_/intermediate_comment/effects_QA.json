It has two main functions, clipping and echo. The module is parameterized by a resolution parameter and it takes in a clock signal, a 10-bit switch signal, and a data input of size determined by RESOLUTION. The output is the processed audio data. A \"clipping\" operation is performed first which possibly limits the amplitude of the input data based on the value of the first bit of the switch signal (enabling or disabling the clipping effect) before passing the result to an \"echo\" operation which adds the echo effect based on the second bit of the switch signal. The processed audio data is output after undergoing these digital sound effects."

Explanation: 'data_CLK' is the clock signal used for synchronization of the operations within the module.

'data_in' is the incoming data (of size RESOLUTION bits) to be processed.\n\nOutput ports: data_out. Explanation: 'data_out' is the output data post all the transformations (clipping and echo treatment) are performed. This will also be of RESOLUTION bits as the input data.
