Module-level comment: The 'effects' module is a parametrized sound effects modifier targeting clipping and echo functionality synchronized with 'data_CLK'. Input 'data_in' is processed based on the status of a 10-bit switch 'SW'. 'SW[0]' activates/disables clipping while 'SW[1]' controls echo. Cross-operation data transfer is facilitated by the internal wire 'L1'. The final processed data is output through 'data_out'.
