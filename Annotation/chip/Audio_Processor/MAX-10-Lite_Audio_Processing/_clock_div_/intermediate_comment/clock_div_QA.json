The division rate is adjustable and determined by the parameter 'DIVISOR'. At every rising edge of the input clock signal, the 'count' registers increment by 1. If 'count' reaches a value equal to 'DIVISOR-1', it resets back to zero. The output clock 'div_clk' switches its state depending on whether the 'count' is less than half of the 'DIVISOR' value."
