    "spec": "Module name: clock_div. \n\nModule specification: The clock_div module in Verilog effectively serves as an adjustable clock signal frequency divider. The rate of division is determined by the user-defined parameter 'DIVISOR'. It consists of input ports 'clk' (the primary clock signal input) and 'reset' (which doesn't seem to be used in the given code), and an output port 'div_clk', which is the divided frequency of the incoming clock signal. Internally, a 32-bit register 'count' functions as a counter, incrementing its value by 1 at each rising edge of the input clock signal ('clk'), and resets to zero when it equals 'DIVISOR-1'. The output 'div_clk' toggles between 0 and 1, based on whether 'count' is less than half of the 'DIVISOR' value. Another internal signal 'count_test' is declared but its purpose isn't utilized. The code comprises of two main sections, i.e., the 'initial' block initializing 'div_clk' and 'count' to zero, and an 'always' block at the positive edge of the 'clk' signal dynamically manipulating 'count' and 'div_clk' values to yield the required clock division.",
