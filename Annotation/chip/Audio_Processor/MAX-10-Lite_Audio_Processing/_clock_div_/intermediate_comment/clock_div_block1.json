    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a clock divider in Verilog. It constantly increments a counter 'count' by 1 at every positive edge of the main clock signal 'clk'. Upon reaching a predetermined divisor value (DIVISOR), the counter is reset to zero. A divided clock signal 'div_clk' is then generated where its high period and low period is determined by whether the count is less than half of the divisor value or not."
