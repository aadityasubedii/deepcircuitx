Module-level comment: This module, clock_div, divides the frequency of an input clock signal ('clk') based on a parameter 'DIVISOR'. Initial values for 'div_clk' and a 32-bit register 'count' are set to zero. Upon each positive edge of 'clk', 'count' increments, resetting to zero when its value reaches 'DIVISOR-1'. The output signal 'div_clk' toggles based on 'count' being less than half of 'DIVISOR'. Note that another signal 'count_test' is defined but not utilized in the current module.
