Module-level comment: The echo module, parameterized by RESOLUTION and DEPTH, implements a digital echo system with data_in as the input and data_out as the output. Upon a rising clk edge, the module either directly passes input to output when enable is low or executes an echo operation. Echo operation includes storing incoming data into a buffer, shifting existing buffer data, and calculating output as the sum of input and a delayed buffer output. The buffer, indexed through an internal integer i, functions as the delay lineage for the echo effect. Buffer updating and data shifting are controlled by a nested for-loop within the always-block.
