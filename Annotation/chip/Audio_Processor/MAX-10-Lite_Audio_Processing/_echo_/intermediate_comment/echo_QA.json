It is parameterized with two variables, RESOLUTION and DEPTH. RESOLUTION sets the bit-width of the input and output data, and DEPTH determines the length or number of units of delay. The 'echo' module receives an input signal 'data_in', stores it in a buffer with depth DEPTH, and retrieves it from the buffer to send to the output 'data_out' while adding it to the current 'data_in'. If 'enable' signal is low, the input will be directly transferred to the output ignoring any operations. When the 'enable' signal is high, the system initiates a loop shifting all the elements of the buffer, and stores the recent input to the buffer's first index. The output at this state will be the value of input 'data_in' plus the last value from the buffer shifted by 2."
