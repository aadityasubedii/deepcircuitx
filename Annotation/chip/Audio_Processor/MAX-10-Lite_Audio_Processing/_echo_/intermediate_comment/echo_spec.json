    "spec": "Module name: echo.\nModule Specification: \n\nThe 'echo' module is a digital echo system, with control parameters RESOLUTION, determining the bit-width for input and output data, and DEPTH, specifying the delay length. The module functions by receiving an input signal 'data_in', storing it in a buffer, then retrieving it from the buffer to send to the output 'data_out' while also summing it with the current 'data_in'. There are two input and one output port: 'clk', which is a clock signal that synchronizes operations within the module; 'enable', acting as a control signal, when set, the echo functionality is active, otherwise, the input directly transfers to the output; and 'data_out', the module's output signal carrying the processed data. The internal signals include 'buffer', a storage array of registers, based on RESOLUTION and DEPTH, storing the input data and supplying it for output calculation, and 'i', acting as the loop index for shifting data within the buffer. The code can be broken down into three parts. The first part declares the inputs, outputs, and parameters. The core functionality is established in the 'always' block that works upon each positive edge of 'clk', conditioning upon the value of 'enable'. If 'enable' is low, the input directly passes to the output. Otherwise, the echo functionality is activated, the buffer updates its stored data, and the output is calculated with the current input and a delayed buffer output. The third part, enclosed within 'for', handles the shifting of data inside the buffer when the echo operation is on.",

The 'echo' module receives an input signal 'data_in', stores it in a buffer with depth DEPTH, and retrieves it from the buffer to send to the output 'data_out' while adding it to the current 'data_in'. If 'enable' signal is low, the input will be directly transferred to the output ignoring any operations. When the 'enable' signal is high, the system initiates a loop shifting all the elements of the buffer, and stores the recent input to the buffer's first index.
