The fpgapu repository contains a comprehensive suite of Verilog modules designed for FPGA-based audio processing and sound synthesis, incorporating a variety of functional components including wave generation, timing control, pulse width modulation (PWM), and sequence management. Modules such as the sine_generator, channel-based pulse and noise generators, and audio processing units are essential for producing and manipulating audio signals through methods such as table-lookup for sine values and dynamic waveform generation through sequencers. Timing elements like the timing_strobe_generator provide foundational timing marks ('ticks' and 'beats') for synchronization across audio components. The repository features extensive support for clock-synchronous PWM signal generation and management, evident through modules like pwm_top and pwm_sequencer, which facilitate precise control over audio signal duty cycles and amplitudes. Note sequencing is handled by specialized sequencers for each channel, managing musical note properties and sequences to create rich audio outputs. Moreover, the repository includes fundamental support components such as switch synchronizers and memory elements like ROM for asynchronous data reading, all tied together at the top level by the fpgapu_sdl_top which integrates these features to output processed audio samples. This creates a robust digital audio processing environment, suitable for applications requiring complex audio signal generation and manipulation, all within a parameterizable and scalable Verilog-based framework.
