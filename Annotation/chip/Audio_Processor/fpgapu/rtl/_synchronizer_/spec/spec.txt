Module name: synchronizer. 

Module specification: The synchronizer module acts as a two-stage data synchronizer to reduce the likelihood of metastability. It employs an input clock signal 'i_clk', which regulates the synchronization process. 'i_input' is a data input that the module synchronizes using two flip-flops implemented as registers, 'r_input_sync_1' and 'r_input_sync_2'. The two sequential registers create a double buffering system, sequentially processing the incoming signal and thereby reducing the possibility of metastability. The synchronized output of the input data signal is reflected in 'o_input_sync'. The code can be divided into two sections. First, the 'always' block, which on every positive clock edge, sequentially assigns the value of 'i_input' to 'r_input_sync_1' and the value of 'r_input_sync_1' to 'r_input_sync_2', creating a two-stage synchronizer. Second, the 'assign' statement maps the final synchronized signal 'r_input_sync_2' to the output 'o_input_sync'.
