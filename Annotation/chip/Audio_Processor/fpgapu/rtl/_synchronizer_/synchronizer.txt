Module-level comment: The 'synchronizer' module acts as a two-stage data synchronizer, mainly used for mitigating metastability. It uses an input signal 'i_input' and clock 'i_clk' to perform synchronous operations. Two registers, 'r_input_sync_1' and 'r_input_sync_2', form a synchronizer chain, processing the input at each clock edge. Finally, the synchronized signal is available at 'o_input_sync'.
