This block of code implements a synchronizer to mitigate metastability issues. It is a common practice in digital design when signals are crossing clock domains. Here, it takes an input signal 'i_input' and synchronizes it with the rising edge of clock 'i_clk'. Conceptually, it creates a pipeline of registers 'r_input_sync_2', 'r_input_sync_1', and updates their values sequentially when the clock edge arrives, which achieve synchronization in the design.
