This statement in Verilog code is used for signal assignment. Specifically, it assigns the value of 'r_input_sync_2' to the 'o_input_sync'. This is achieved through continuous assignment, meaning that the assigned value will always reflect any changes in 'r_input_sync_2'. Due to this property, it is often used for wiring in circuit design for synchronous digital systems.
