Module-level comment: The reset_generator module produces reset signals for external digital circuits using a clock input (`i_clk`). It implements a counter (`rst_count`) proportional to the `COUNT_WIDTH` parameter which increments at each clock's positive edge when the reset output (`o_rst`) is high. The reset output is active until the counter hits a threshold where its MSB flips, thus ending the reset period by bringing `o_rst` back to low.
