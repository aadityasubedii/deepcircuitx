It has a counter running on a clock (i_clk) input. The reset signal output (o_rst) will change state on every clock positive edge if it is already asserted high (1). This mechanism generates a reset period that lasts for a count determined by the parameter COUNT_WIDTH. As the count increases, it eventually causes o_rst to de-assert (go low), effectively ending the reset period."
