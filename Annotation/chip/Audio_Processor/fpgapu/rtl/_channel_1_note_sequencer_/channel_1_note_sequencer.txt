Module-level comment: The channel_1_note_sequencer module functions as a sequencer for a sequence of musical notes, adjusting the attributes like duration, envelope, and vibrato of each note. It takes clock, reset, note strobe, and tick strobe signals as inputs. The module logic, divided into blocks controlled by always statements, manages the sequence progression and attribute modulation. It uses internal counters and look-up tables to adjust note property, implement vibrato, and envelope controls. The phase delta output, computed by adding note table phase delta to a vibrato adjustment value, can be used for music synthesis.
