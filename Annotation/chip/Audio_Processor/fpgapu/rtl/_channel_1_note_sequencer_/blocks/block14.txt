Comment: 
The block creates a wire `r_new_note` which gets activated in two situations: When `i_note_stb` signal is high and when the value of `r_duration_count` matches `r_note_len`. The mentioned line works as an AND gate, with `i_note_stb` and equality of `r_duration_count` and `r_note_len` as two inputs which helps in triggering the new note in a circuit.
