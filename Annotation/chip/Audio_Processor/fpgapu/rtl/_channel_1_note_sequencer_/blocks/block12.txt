Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages an envelope index, a counter that is reset or incremented depending on specific conditions. When a rising edge is detected on the input clock signal (i_clk), if reset signal (i_rst) or new note signal (r_new_note) is high, the r_envelope_index is reset to 0. Otherwise, if a strobe signal (i_tick_stb) is received, the envelope index either stays at 15 if it's already there or increments by 1 for any other value.
