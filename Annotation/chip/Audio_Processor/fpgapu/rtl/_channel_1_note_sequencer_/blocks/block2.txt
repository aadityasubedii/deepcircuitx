This block is used to adjust the vibrato effect in a sound signal processing system. The adjustment of the vibrato effect is based on the depth of modulation and the index value. On every positive edge of the input clock, the vibrato adjustment value is updated. The amount of adjustment is determined by a case statement which checks the vibrato adjustment index (r_vibrato_adjust_index). Depending on the index value, the vibrato adjustment (r_vibrato_adjust) is set to the negative or positive of two possible depths (r_vibrato_depth_1, r_vibrato_depth_2) or zero. The default case resets the adjustment to zero.
