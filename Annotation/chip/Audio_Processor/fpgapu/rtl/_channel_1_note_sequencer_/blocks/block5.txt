This block of code represents a ROM (Read-Only Memory) module instance for storing vibrato depth values. The ROM is asynchronous and uses a file named 'VIBRATO_TABLE_FILE' as its source for data loading. It is a 64-bit wide and 8-depth ROM where the address is given by 'r_vibrato_depth' and the output data is stored in the wire 'r_vibrato_depths'.
