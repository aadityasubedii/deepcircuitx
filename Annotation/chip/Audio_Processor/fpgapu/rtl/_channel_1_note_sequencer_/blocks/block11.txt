Comment: 
This code block functions as an envelope generator in a digital synthesizer implemented in Verilog. Utilizing a case statement routing the 4-bit binary envelope index, it maps various indices to predefined envelope values which are then doubled. This doubling likely corresponds to a scaling operation required by the synthesizer environment. The `r_envelope` variable tracks the envelope level as defined by `r_envelope_index`. For undefined indices, `r_envelope` defaults to zero, effectively allowing for a natural decay to silence in the synthesizer function.
