    "block_comment": "This block is a combinational logic circuit that maps predefined 4-bit note indices to specific musical notes and their corresponding lengths. Depending on the value of `r_note_index`, the block assigns the variable `r_note` a defined note from a macro (e.g., `NOTE_RST` or `NOTE_Cs5`) and assigns `r_note_len` the length of the note obtained from the function `note_len()`. The note length and the specific note defined in `r_note` are used elsewhere, likely to synthesize the notes for a song or tone generation. The default case handles any undefined 4-bit values by setting `r_note` to `NOTE_RST` and `r_note_len` to `note_len(4)`."
