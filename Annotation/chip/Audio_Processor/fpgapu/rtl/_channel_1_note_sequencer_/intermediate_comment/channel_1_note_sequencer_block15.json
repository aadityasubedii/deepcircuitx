    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code functions as a note sequence handler in a digital musical instrument system. The \"always\" block detects the rising edge of the input clock (i_clk). Upon activation, it first checks whether the reset signal (i_rst) is high. If true, it resets the note index and duration count. If the note strobe signal (i_note_stb) is high and the duration count matches the note length, it resets duration count, increments the note index, and wraps the note index around to zero if it exceeds a certain length (15). Otherwise, it increments the duration count."
