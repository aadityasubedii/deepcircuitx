    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for generating vibrato effects by manipulating the indexing of incoming musical notes. When a clock signal rises and in the absence of a reset or 'i_rst' signal, the vibrato length count and index are reset to 0. However, if a notestart signal 'i_note_stb' is received and the current vibrato length count equals the set vibrato length, the count is reset and the index incremented by 1. Upon reaching an upper limit of 12, the vibrato index resets to zero. If the vibrato length count has not reached its set length, it is incremented at each rising clock edge."
