    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns output values and operates a note_table module. Firstly, it initializes the o_top to a hexadecimal value 'ff' and assigns binary 1 to the o_top_valid, denoting that the output value is valid. Then, it declares a 32 bit wide wire called w_phase_delta. The note_table module, parameterized with the NOTE_TABLE_FILE, is instantiated, using r_note as an input and w_phase_delta as an output. Finally, it assigns the value of r_envelope to o_envelope."
