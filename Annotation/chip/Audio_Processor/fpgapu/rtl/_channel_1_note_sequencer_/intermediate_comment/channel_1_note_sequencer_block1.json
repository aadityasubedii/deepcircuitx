    "block_comment": "The block of code performs a function of calculating an output phase delta (`o_phase_delta`) based on the sum of the wire phase delta (`w_phase_delta`) and the registered vibrato adjustment value (`r_vibrato_adjust`). It employs the `assign` statement, a continuous assignment feature in Verilog RTL, which continuously evaluates the right-hand expression and assigns the evaluated value to the left-hand net. Here, it adds the `w_phase_delta` and `r_vibrato_adjust` values and assigns the result to `o_phase_delta`."
