    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the condition under which new vibrato can happen and initializes the depth of the vibrato. The vibrato is initiated when i_note_stb signal is asserted and counter r_vibrato_len_count equals to r_vibrato_len, constituting the wire r_new_vibrato. A 3-bit register r_vibrato_depth responsible for storing the depth of the vibrato is also initialized to zero."
