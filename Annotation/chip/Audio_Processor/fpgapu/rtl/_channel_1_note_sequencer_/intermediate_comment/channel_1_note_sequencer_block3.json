    "block_comment": "This block implements a vibrato adjustment index with automatic reset and update mechanism. Upon the positive edge of the clock signal, if an \u2018i_rst\u2019 or an \u2018r_new_vibrato\u2019 signal is detected, the index is reset to zero. However, if an \u2018i_tick_stb\u2019 signal is detected, the block checks the current value of the index. If the index is at its maximum value \u20183\u2019d07\u2019, it wraps back to zero, otherwise, it increments by one."
