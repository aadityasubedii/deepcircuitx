Module-level comment: The audio_processing_unit combines four types of audio signals to produce a mixed output. Utilizing a clock (i_clk) for synchronization, a reset signal (i_rst) for system control, and a mixer input (i_mixer) to specify the mixed channels, the module processes pulse signals from channel_1 and channel_2, a triangle signal from channel_3, and noise from channel_4. Outputs include a 9-bit mixed signal (o_sample) and frame pulses from all channels (o_frame_pulse). The mixing operation is implemented in a summarizing logic, with each signal type generated in its respective instantiated block (pulse_1, pulse_2, triangle_3, and noise).
