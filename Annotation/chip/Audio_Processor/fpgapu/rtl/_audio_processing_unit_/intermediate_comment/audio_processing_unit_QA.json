It allows the processing of four different audio channels. Each channel can handle different types of signals - pulse signal (channels 1 and 2), triangle signal (channel 3), and noise (channel 4). The processing module takes the signals from each channel as per the mixer input and combines them to produce the output sample. It is also built with a time-strobe generator that provides timing for the pulses in each audio channel. The result is a finely mixed audio output as per the provided channel inputs."

It is used to put the system into a known initial state.\n3. `i_mixer`: This 4-bit input acts as a switch to mix signals from different channels before output.\n\nOutput ports:\n1. `o_sample`: This is a 9-bit output signal which is a result of mixing signals from different channels based on the `i_mixer` input.\n2. `o_frame_pulse`: This 4-bit output is a collection of frame pulses from the four channels in the module.\n\nExplanation: \nInput port `i_clk` is used for all synchronous operations in the module. `i_rst` is used to reset the system to an initial state, typically when the system starts or in case of any error conditions. `i_mixer` is a control input that decides which of the channels should contribute to the final `o_sample`. This mixer input directly influences the final mixed output.\n\nThe `o_sample` output is a 9-bit wide signal that constitutes the mixed audio signal output. The mixing operation is carried out according to `i_mixer` input signals.
