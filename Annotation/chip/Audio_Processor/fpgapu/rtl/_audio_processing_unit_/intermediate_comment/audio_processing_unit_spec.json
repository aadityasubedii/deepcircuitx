    "spec": "Module name: audio_processing_unit.\nModule specification: The audio_processing_unit is a high-level module in the system that performs the functioning of an audio processing unit. It processes and combines four separate types of audio signals: pulse signals from channels 1 and 2, a triangle signal from channel 3, and noise from channel 4. This combination of signals gives a finely mixed audio signal that is controlled by a mixer input, and the timing of these operations is managed by a time-strobe generator carried out inside the module. \n\nThe module has the following input ports: `i_clk` for clock synchronization, `i_rst` for resetting the system to its initial state, and `i_mixer` to control the mixture of signals from the four channels. The output ports are: `o_sample`, a 9-bit output of the mixed audio sample and `o_frame_pulse` that collects frame pulse signals from different channels for further processing or debugging.\n\nThe module uses ten internal signals for operation purposes which include `w_tick_stb` and `w_beat_stb` for generating ticking and beating information, `w_compare_pulse_1`, `w_compare_pulse_2`, `w_triangle_3_output`, and `w_noise_output` for collecting signals from different channels, and `w_frame_pulse_1`, `w_frame_pulse_2`, `w_frame_pulse_3`, and `w_frame_pulse_4` for collecting frame pulse information from the different channels. \n\nThe verilog code for the module is structured around different blocks that instantiate each of the individual channels (pulse_1, pulse_2, triangle_3, and noise), a timing strobe generator (pulse_generator), and logic to sum up the selected channels as per the i_mixer input and to generate frame pulses. Each of these blocks performs individual functions contributing to the overall operation of the audio_processing_unit as described above.",

It allows the processing of four different audio channels. Each channel can handle different types of signals - pulse signal (channels 1 and 2), triangle signal (channel 3), and noise (channel 4). The processing module takes the signals from each channel as per the mixer input and combines them to produce the output sample. It is also built with a time-strobe generator that provides timing for the pulses in each audio channel. The result is a finely mixed audio output as per the provided channel inputs."

It is used to put the system into a known initial state.\n3. `i_mixer`: This 4-bit input acts as a switch to mix signals from different channels before output.\n\nOutput ports:\n1. `o_sample`: This is a 9-bit output signal which is a result of mixing signals from different channels based on the `i_mixer` input.\n2. `o_frame_pulse`: This 4-bit output is a collection of frame pulses from the four channels in the module.\n\nExplanation: \nInput port `i_clk` is used for all synchronous operations in the module. `i_rst` is used to reset the system to an initial state, typically when the system starts or in case of any error conditions. `i_mixer` is a control input that decides which of the channels should contribute to the final `o_sample`. This mixer input directly influences the final mixed output.\n\nThe `o_sample` output is a 9-bit wide signal that constitutes the mixed audio signal output. The mixing operation is carried out according to `i_mixer` input signals.
