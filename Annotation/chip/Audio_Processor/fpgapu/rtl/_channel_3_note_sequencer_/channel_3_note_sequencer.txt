Module-level comment: The "channel_3_note_sequencer" module is a controller for sound note timings and durations in a sound system. It employs a clock signal (i_clk) and a reset signal (i_rst) as inputs along with note_tick (i_note_stb) signal to maintain control. Internally, it maintains a note index (r_note_index) and note duration count (r_duration_count). Notes sequence and their duration are controlled by case sections. The output (o_phase_delta), activated by a validation signal (o_top_valid), is fed into a note_table to generate the appropriate output waveform. The processing is synchronized by the clock signal and can be reset using the reset signal.
