This block of code instantiates the module `note_table` which is parameterized by a file (`NOTE_TABLE_FILE`). The function of this block is to map an input note (`r_note`) to a particular phase delta value (`o_phase_delta`), as determined by the note table from the file. It achieves its function by interfacing with the `note_table` module, passing `r_note` as an input and receiving `o_phase_delta` as an output. The specific mapping and calculation happen within the `note_table` module, which is parameterized by the provided file.
