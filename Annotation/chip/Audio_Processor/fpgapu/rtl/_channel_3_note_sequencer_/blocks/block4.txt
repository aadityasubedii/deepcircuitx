Comment: 
This block forms a counter for musical notes and their durations. In every clock cycle, if a reset signal is encountered, it reinitializes the note index and duration count. When a strobe signal for new note is observed, the block checks if the duration count is equal to the note length. If so, it resets the duration count and increments the note index. If the note index exceeds the prescribed range of 13, it loops back to the start. On the other hand, if the duration count does not reach the note length, it increments the duration count, extending the playing time of the current note. Note length and duration are specified by the inputs and are used to control the timing and sequencing of the notes.
