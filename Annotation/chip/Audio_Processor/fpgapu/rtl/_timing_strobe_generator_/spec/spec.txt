Module name: timing_strobe_generator. 

Module specification: The 'timing_strobe_generator' module serves as a fundamental timing unit for digital systems, primarily designed to generate timing strobes, categorized as 'ticks' and 'beats'. The input ports 'i_clk' and 'i_rst' designate the clock signal driving the internal operating rhythm of the module and the reset signal that allows the sequences to be reset respectively. On the other hand, the output ports 'o_tick_stb' and 'o_beat_stb' represent the completion of 'tick' and 'beat' periods respectively. Internally, two key counters are used; 'r_tick_counter' storing the count of elapsed clock cycles for a tick and 'r_beat_counter' marking the number of ticks in a beat. Other key parameters include 'CLOCKS_PER_TICK' (number of clock cycles per tick), 'TICK_WIDTH' (bit width for 'CLOCKS_PER_TICK'), 'TICKS_PER_BEAT' (number of ticks per beat), and 'BEAT_WIDTH' (bit width for 'TICKS_PER_BEAT'). The module is structured around two major always blocks, the first manages counting of the clock cycles for a tick and resetting, and the second handles the count of 'tick' for a 'beat'. This design concept enables use of strobes in strategically aligning operations with complex timing structures.
