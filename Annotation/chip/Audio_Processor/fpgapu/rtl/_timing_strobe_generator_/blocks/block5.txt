This block of code is essentially a display block used for debugging and understanding the state of the variables 'CLOCKS_PER_TICK' and 'TICK_WIDTH' in a Verilog testbench. It is triggered at every change of any signal in the design under test, and upon execution, it prints the current value of the constants 'CLOCKS_PER_TICK' and 'TICK_WIDTH'. This information can be leveraged to provide insights into the system's state at various time instances. This block is primarily used for observatory purposes to monitor these particular parameters during simulation.
