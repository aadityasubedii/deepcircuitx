The function implements a basic division operation with rounding. It accepts two integer inputs as dividend and divisor and returns the rounded integer result of the division operation. Specifically, it achieves this by adding half of divisor to the dividend before the division operation, forcing the result to be rounded to the nearest integer when the divisor is divided.
