This block of code acts as a counter that resets upon reaching a specific value (CLOCKS_PER_TICK). There are three primary conditions: in case of a reset (i_rst), the counter (r_tick_counter) is set to zero; when the counter equals CLOCKS_PER_TICK-1, it resets to zero, effectively making CLOCKS_PER_TICK the counter's modulo; otherwise, it increments the counter by one each clock cycle.
