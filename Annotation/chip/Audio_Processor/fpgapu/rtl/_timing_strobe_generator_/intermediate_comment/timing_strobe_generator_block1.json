    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to generate a beat strobe signal (o_beat_stb). The beat strobe is assigned truth whenever there is a tick strobe (o_tick_stb) and the beat counter (r_beat_counter) is equal to one less than the total ticks per beat (TICKS_PER_BEAT-1). This implementation implies a scenario where a beat is represented as a sequence of ticks, and the last tick in the sequence triggers the beat strobe."
