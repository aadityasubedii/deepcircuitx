The input ports 'i_clk' and 'i_rst' designate the clock signal driving the internal operating rhythm of the module and the reset signal that allows the sequences to be reset respectively. On the other hand, the output ports 'o_tick_stb' and 'o_beat_stb' represent the completion of 'tick' and 'beat' periods respectively. Internally, two key counters are used; 'r_tick_counter' storing the count of elapsed clock cycles for a tick and 'r_beat_counter' marking the number of ticks in a beat. Other key parameters include 'CLOCKS_PER_TICK' (number of clock cycles per tick), 'TICK_WIDTH' (bit width for 'CLOCKS_PER_TICK'), 'TICKS_PER_BEAT' (number of ticks per beat), and 'BEAT_WIDTH' (bit width for 'TICKS_PER_BEAT'). The module is structured around two major always blocks, the first manages counting of the clock cycles for a tick and resetting, and the second handles the count of 'tick' for a 'beat'. This design concept enables use of strobes in strategically aligning operations with complex timing structures.",

The module has two types of strobe outputs, 'tick' and 'beat'. \n\nThe module calculates the number of clock cycles that should represent one 'tick' based on the clock frequency and then maintains this count. This count forms the basis of generating the 'tick' strobe signal (`o_tick_stb`), which is asserted when the tick counter matches the calculated count.\n\nIn addition, it maintains a 'beat' count that increments whenever a 'tick' occurs. The number of 'ticks' in a 'beat' is a predefined parameter in the module (`TICKS_PER_BEAT`). This count forms the basis for generating the 'beat' strobe signal (`o_beat_stb`). The 'beat' strobe is asserted when both the 'tick' strobe is asserted and when the 'beat' count matches the predefined count. \n\nUpon an incoming reset signal (`i_rst`), all counters are held to zero.\n\nThese strobes can be used to align operations to timing structures in complex digital systems."

'i_rst' is an input reset signal responsible for resetting the states of the counters within the module to default or zero state, ensuring that sequence of operations can be restarted at any time.\n\nOutput ports: [o_tick_stb, o_beat_stb]. \n\nExplanation: 'o_tick_stb' is the output tick strobe signal which signals the completion of a tick time interval as calculated by the module. 'o_beat_stb' is the output beat strobe signal which signals the completion of a beat time interval. A beat interval is defined as a number of tick intervals.
