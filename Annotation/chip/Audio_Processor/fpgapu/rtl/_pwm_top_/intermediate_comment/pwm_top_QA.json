This module reads four switch inputs, and based on their status, controls several outputs, including three PMOD outputs. It contains a switch synchronizer, a reset generator, and an audio processing unit (APU) which uses note, vibrato, and noise tables stored in external files; the tables are used to generate analog audio signals. It uses the PWM to generate a signal that varies its duty cycle based on incoming digital audio samples. The PMOD outputs carry the generated PWM signal, the frame pulse from the APU, and the inverted PWM signal respectively."

The io_PMOD_1 and io_PMOD_3 carry regular and inverted PWM signals, which can be used for generating analog audio signals from the digital domain. The io_PMOD_2 carries the frame pulse signal which could be used for indicating the start of a new audio frame."
