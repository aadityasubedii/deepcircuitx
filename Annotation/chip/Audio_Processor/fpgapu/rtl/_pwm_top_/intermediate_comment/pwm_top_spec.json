    "spec": "Module name: pwm_top. \n\nModule specification: The 'pwm_top' is a top-level module designed to generate and control Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals for the operation of an audio processing unit. This module includes several blocks like a switch synchronizer, reset generator, and an audio processing unit (APU) to manage the sound generation process. \n\nThe module has several input ports including a clock signal (i_Clk) and four switch inputs (i_Switch_1 to i_Switch_4). The clock signal is used for synchronization throughout the module and the switches allow user interaction triggering different audio processing features. It provides three output ports (io_PMOD_1, io_PMOD_2, io_PMOD_3) that carry a regular PWM signal, a frame pulse from the APU, and an inverted version of the PWM signal respectively, each targeting different functionalities in the audio output hardware.\n\nThe internal signals of the module include the clock signal (i_clk), synchronized switch signals (w_switches), the APU reset signal (w_rst), and the inverse of the switch signals for controlling the APU (w_mixer). Additionally, it utilizes signals for audio sample comparisons (w_compare), frame pulse generation (w_frame_pulse), PWM signal (w_pwm), and PWM cycle end indicator (w_cycle_end). \n\nThe code of the module can be segmented into different blocks. The 'switch synchronizers' block synchronizes the user-operated switch inputs. The 'reset generator' initiates the APU reset when needed. The 'audio processing unit' performs sound signal processing using predefined resources and provides the 'w_compare' and 'w_frame_pulse' signals. The 'pwm' module takes in compare values, providing PWM signal and cycle end outputs. The final assignments tabulate the outputs of the module making the PWM signal, frame pulse, and the inverted PWM signal available at the io_PMOD_1, io_PMOD_2, and io_PMOD_3 outputs.",
