    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pwm_top' module generates and controls PWM signals for an audio processing unit. It uses a clock signal and four switch inputs to adjust the audio outputs and uses external files for audio tables. Internally, it comprises blocks like a switch synchronizer, reset generator, and APU to handle sound processing. Outputs include regular and inverted PWM signals and a frame pulse. Implementation relies on wire signals for synchronization, control inputs, audio sample comparisons, and cycle indications."
