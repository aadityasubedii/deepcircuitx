Module-level comment: Module `channel_4_noise` generates a noise signal using a table from `NOISE_TABLE_FILE`. It uses inputs `i_clk` for synchronization, `i_rst` for reset, `i_tick_stb` and `i_note_stb` for initiating signals, producing an audio `o_output` signal and an `o_frame_pulse` flag. Internally, it employs a 'sequencer' to generate intermediate signals and a 'phase_generator' for waveform phase representation. It includes a shift register for output computation based on the least significant bit of the register and waveform's amplitude from the noise file.
