    "spec": "Module name: `channel_4_noise`.\n\nModule specification: The 'channel_4_noise' module plays an integral role in the production of a noise signal, possibly within the framework of a synthesizer. The module receives the following inputs: `i_clk`, used for synchronization of operations within the module; `i_rst`, a reset signal used for initializing the system; `i_tick_stb`, a tick operation initiating signal; `i_note_stb`, a note operation initiating signal; and `NOISE_TABLE_FILE`, a parameter containing the name of file from which a noise table is read. The module generates two outputs: `o_output`, a 9-bit audio data signal calculated from an integrated shift register and a generated noise table; `o_frame_pulse`, potentially a signal used to confirm the completion of a frame pulse.\n\nInternally, the module uses several significant signals like `w_top`, `w_top_valid`, `w_phase_delta`, `w_compare_valid`, `w_envelope`, `w_phase`, `w_phase_strobe`, and `r_shift_register`. The purpose of these signals includes holding intermediate values during calculation (`w_top`, `r_shift_register`), validating stages in operations (`w_top_valid`, `w_compare_valid`), tracking signal phase change (`w_phase_delta`), managing overall amplitude structure of a waveform (`w_envelope`), and current phase (`w_phase`) of the waveform. Also, a triggering signal `w_phase_strobe` initiates at each phase transition.\n\nThe module consists of a 'sequencer' sub-module (channel_4_note_sequencer), which processes inputs based on the noise file and generates intermediate signals. Furthermore, a 'phase_generator' sub-module generates signals representing the current phase of the waveform. The 'channel_4_noise' module also maintains a 14-bit 'shift register' updated every clock cycle to calculate the output signal. The complication of the output signal depends on the least significant bit of `r_shift_register` and the current value of the `w_envelope` wire. An assigned statement derives the output, ensuring the module's functionality continuity.",
