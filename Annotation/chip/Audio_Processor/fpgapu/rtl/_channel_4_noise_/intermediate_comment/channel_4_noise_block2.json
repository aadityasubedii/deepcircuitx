    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing a shift register operation with a specific reset and update rule. Upon every `i_clk` positive edge, the `always` block checks for a reset signal `i_rst`. If `i_rst` is active, the 14-bit shift register `r_shift_register` gets reset to 1. If `i_rst` is inactive and the `w_phase_strobe` is active, the shift register gets updated. The update operation works by shifting old values to the right while the MSB gets updated with an XOR operation of its two LSBs."
