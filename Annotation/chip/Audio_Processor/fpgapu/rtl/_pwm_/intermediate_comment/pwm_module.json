    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pwm' is a PWM generator that produces signals based on the provided parameters. It uses i_clk as the clock signal, with i_top and i_compare as the top and comparison values, updated when their corresponding valid flags are high. Output 'o_pwm' is logic high when counter < compare value, whereas 'o_cycle_end' indicates the end of a cycle. Internally, it uses latched values of i_top and i_compare to handle dynamic changes, and a counter to track the current state. The code mainly comprises of a section to handle counter and signal updates, and another to control PWM signal output."
