    "block_comment": "The block of code generates a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal. It has a counter 'r_counter' that is compared with a constant value 'r_compare'. The output 'o_pwm' gets high when the counter value is less than the comparison value, producing the effect of pulse width modulation."
