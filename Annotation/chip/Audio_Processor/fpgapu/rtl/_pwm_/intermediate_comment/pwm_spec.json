    "spec": "Module name: pwm. \n\nModule specification: The pwm is a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) generator module written in Verilog. The purpose of this module is to generate PWM signals based on given parameters. This module uses i_clk as a clock signal, i_top as the maximum value of the counter, i_top_valid as a signal to update the top value, i_compare as a counter comparator, and i_compare_valid as a signal to update the comparison value. The pwm signal output (o_pwm) is generated based on whether the counter value is less than the i_compare value and is accordingly high (1) or low (0). The pwm cycle end signal (o_cycle_end) is driven high for one clock cycle when the counter equals i_top, indicating the completion of one pwm cycle.\n\nImmensely crucial to the function of the pwm module are the internal registers encompassing r_latched_top, r_latched_compare, r_counter, r_top, and r_compare. Here, r_latched_top and r_latched_compare latch in new i_top and i_compare values respectively; r_counter works as a counter that increments at every positive clock cycle and resets once it matches r_top; r_top and r_compare are the active operating values for the counter top limit and comparison value.\n\nThe module is principally divided into two parts. The first part is an always block synchronized to the positive edge of the i_clk signal, which is responsible for maintaining counters, latching valid input values, resetting the counter, updating the active top and compare values from their latched versions, and setting the o_cycle_end signal. The second part is an assign block that generates the o_pwm signal by comparing the counter value with the comparison value. \n\nThe module overall offers a highly adaptive and versatile piece of logic for generating PWM signals, adjustable on the fly by controlling i_top and i_compare values. The RESOLUTION parameter further provides the flexibility to set the resolution of the PWM signal yield, resulting in highly precise outcomes for diverse application scenarios.",
