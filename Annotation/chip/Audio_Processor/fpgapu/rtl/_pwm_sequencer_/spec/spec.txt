Module name: pwm_sequencer. 

Module specification: The `pwm_sequencer` is a Verilog module designed to potentially generate a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal, which is typically used for controlling the duty cycle. The module operates synchronously with the input clock signal `i_clk`. It initializes with three internal registers `r_step_count`, `r_compare`, and `r_phase`, which are responsible for counting steps, comparing values for phase switching, and storing the current phase state respectively. The module outputs four signals: `o_top`, `o_top_valid`, `o_compare`, and `o_compare_valid`. `o_top` is a constant 8-bit high signal. `o_top_valid` and `o_compare_valid` are validation signals that indicate the starting of a new modulation cycle when the step count resets. `o_compare` is the main signal reflecting the potential PWM generation, which carries different bit-width data based on the current phase state. The module functions through a continual process where it increments the step count and either increments or resets the compare count with every clock pulse. The phase changes once the compare count reaches its maximum. Different phases lead to different output values for `o_compare`, making the module capable of generating varying waveform shapes depending on the phase and step definitions.
