    "spec": "Module name: pwm_sequencer. \n\nModule specification: The `pwm_sequencer` is a Verilog module designed to potentially generate a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal, which is typically used for controlling the duty cycle. The module operates synchronously with the input clock signal `i_clk`. It initializes with three internal registers `r_step_count`, `r_compare`, and `r_phase`, which are responsible for counting steps, comparing values for phase switching, and storing the current phase state respectively. The module outputs four signals: `o_top`, `o_top_valid`, `o_compare`, and `o_compare_valid`. `o_top` is a constant 8-bit high signal. `o_top_valid` and `o_compare_valid` are validation signals that indicate the starting of a new modulation cycle when the step count resets. `o_compare` is the main signal reflecting the potential PWM generation, which carries different bit-width data based on the current phase state. The module functions through a continual process where it increments the step count and either increments or resets the compare count with every clock pulse. The phase changes once the compare count reaches its maximum. Different phases lead to different output values for `o_compare`, making the module capable of generating varying waveform shapes depending on the phase and step definitions.",

It takes in a clock signal `i_clk` as an input. It has counters `r_step_count` and `r_compare` for keeping the track of step count and compare count respectively. Another register `r_phase` is used to maintain the current phase state. It features four states with different outputs. All these contribute to the module's operation that possibly generates a PWM signal to control the duty cycle. The module outputs two signals (`o_top` and `o_compare`) and their corresponding valid bits (`o_top_valid`, `o_compare_valid`). The valid bits indicates when the corresponding outputs are reliable, seemingly it is when the step counter `r_step_count` starts a new round (equals 0). At every clock edge (`i_clk`), the sequencer increases the step count (`r_step_count`) and either increases or resets the compare count (`r_compare`) depending on its current value. With a given modulation step (`STEP`), the sequencer changes its phase once the compare counter reaches its maximum, and outputs different bit-width signal upon different phase."

It seems to provide a reference voltage level.\n\n2. `o_top_valid`: This is a validation signal associated with `o_top`. It is true when the step count `r_step_count` equals to 0. Thus, it may serve the purpose as a start mark for each modulation cycle.\n\n3. `o_compare`: This is a 9-bit output wire which carries the value from a case switch controlled by the `r_phase` register. The assigned values have connections with `r_compare`, which seems to indicate the duty-cycle control function in a possible PWM generation.\n\n4. `o_compare_valid`: This is a validation signal for `o_compare`.
