    "module": "Module-level comment: The `pwm_sequencer` module is a PWM signal generator operating synchronously with an input clock (`i_clk`). It leverages internal counters (`r_step_count`, `r_compare`) and a phase-register (`r_phase`) to generate different duty cycles. Output signals include a constant reference `o_top`, a modulation signal `o_compare`, and their corresponding valid signals (`o_top_valid`, `o_compare_valid`), activated when a new cycle starts. The module increments step and compare counts on clock edge and switches phases based on compare count, controlling the bit-width of `o_compare` for different phases."
