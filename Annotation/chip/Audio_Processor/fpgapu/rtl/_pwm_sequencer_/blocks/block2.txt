Comment: 
This block of code is used for signal assignment in Verilog. The 'assign' keyword indicates continuous assignment where the right hand side (r_output) is constantly evaluated and assigned to the left hand side (o_compare). Therefore, whatever the value changes in r_output register, it immediately gets reflected in o_compare. This line of code plays an important role in connecting different components of hardware design as it helps propagate the changes in one part of the design to other parts in real-time.
