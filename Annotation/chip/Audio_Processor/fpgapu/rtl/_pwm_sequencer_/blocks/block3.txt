Comment: 
This block is a multiplexer (mux) that selects the value of 'r_output' based on the value of 'r_phase'. It uses the 'case' statement for selection, with 2-bit binary values (0 to 3 inclusive) as the selection criteria and correspondingly assigning 'r_output' with 9-bit values '9'h000', 'r_compare', '9'h100', and '9'h100 - r_compare'. It accomplishes this by storing selected value in 'r_output' which is updated at each evaluation phase.
