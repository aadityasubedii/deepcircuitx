Module-level comment: The switch_synchronizers module synchronizes a 4-bit switch input 'i_switches' with the system clock 'i_clk'. It achieves this by passing each bit of the input through a separate synchronizer (switch_1_sync to switch_4_sync) resulting in synchronized internal signals 'w_switch_1' to 'w_switch_4'. These signals are concatenated to form the output 'o_switches'. This implementation ensures each output bit is synchronized with the system clock.
