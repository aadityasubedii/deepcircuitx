    "spec": "Module name: switch_synchronizers. \n\nModule specification: The switch_synchronizers module is designed to perform the functionality of synchronizing a 4-bit switch input, 'i_switches', to the system clock 'i_clk'. This is done by passing each bit of the switch input 'i_switches' through its separate synchronizer, with the synchronized outputs being concatenated into a 4-bit output 'o_switches'. The input ports include 'i_clk', the system clock responsible for the synchronization, and 'i_switches' which is a 4-bit input representing the state of each distinct switch. The output port is 'o_switches', a 4-bit output where each bit showcases the synchronized state of a corresponding switch. Within the module, there are internal signals 'w_switch_1', 'w_switch_2', 'w_switch_3', and 'w_switch_4' which are outputs from different instances of a synchronizer module. Each signal synchronizes with a corresponding input switch, ensuring that the switch state aligns with the system clock. The overall structure of the module can be divided into five parts - four separate synchronizer instances aligning each switch bit and an 'assign' block which aids in combination of outputs of the four synchronizers into the 4-bit output 'o_switches'.",
