Comment: 
This Verilog block serves the purpose of controlling the duration and sequence of musical notes, by using a counter to keep track. Amid a rising clock edge, the block checks if a reset signal 'i_rst' is active and if so, it resets 'r_note_index' and 'r_duration_count' to zero. If not, and instead 'i_note_stb' is, the block then checks if the counter matches the defined note length 'r_note_len'. If it does, the counter and note index are reset again, cycling back to the first note after reaching the 14th. If it doesn't, the counter is simply incremented by one.
