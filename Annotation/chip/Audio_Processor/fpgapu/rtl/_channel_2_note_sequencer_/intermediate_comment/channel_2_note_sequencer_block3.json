    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to control the index of an envelope generator in a digital synthesizer. It relies largely on clock timing and offers reset capabilities. At each positive edge of the i_clk (input clock), the envelope index `r_envelope_index` is either resetted to 0 in response to an `i_rst` (input reset) or a new note (`r_new_note`). If a tick occurs (`i_tick_stb`), and if the current index is not at its maximum value (8), the index is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains at its maximum value."
