    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the computation of the `r_envelope` variable based on the value of `r_envelope_index`. The block uses a case statement to set the value of `r_envelope`. If `r_envelope_index` variable equals to values from 4'd00 to 4'd06, `r_envelope` is set to `14`, when the `r_envelope_index` is `4'd07`, `r_envelope` is set to `2`. It resets `r_envelope` to '0' for `r_envelope_index` as `4'd08` and for all other default cases. This block runs on every data change (*) and thus is combinational."
