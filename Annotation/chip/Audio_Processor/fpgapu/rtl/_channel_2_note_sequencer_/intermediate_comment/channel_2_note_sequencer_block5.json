    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a new note trigger in a synthesizer design. It uses a wire 'r_new_note' to create the trigger when a note is played. The trigger is activated by a strobe signal 'i_note_stb' ANDed with a condition where the current duration count 'r_duration_count' equals the length of the note 'r_note_len'. This checks if the ongoing note has reached its end, allowing another note to be played."
