    "block_comment": "This block of code loads a note table from an external HEX file into the 'note_table' variable in Verilog, if the file exists. The 'FILE' variable is checked at initialization time, if it's not equal to zero, this indicates that a file must be loaded. The '$readmemh' system function is used to read the hexadecimal values from the file specified by 'FILE' attribute into the 'note_table' memory. The '$display' function is used to inform the user about the file being loaded."
