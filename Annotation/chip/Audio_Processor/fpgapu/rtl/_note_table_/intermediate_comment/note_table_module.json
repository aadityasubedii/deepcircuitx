    "module": "Module-level comment: This is a 'note_table' module in Verilog. It defines a lookup table ('note_table') of 64 32-bit values. The data for this table is optionally read from a provided file ('FILE' parameter). The module takes a 6-bit index 'i_note' as input and returns the corresponding table value on 'o_compare' - a 32-bit output. The table indexing operation is performed continuously whereas the file reading operation is performed once at the start of the simulation. This provides a convenient data sourcing and retrieval mechanism for the design."
