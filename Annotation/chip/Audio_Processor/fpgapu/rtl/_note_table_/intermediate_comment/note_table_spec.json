    "spec": "Module name: note_table. \n\nModule specification: The purpose of the 'note_table' module, defined in Verilog RTL code, is to establish an internal data lookup table named 'note_table'. This lookup table has 64 elements, each being a 32-bit wide register, indexed from 63 down to 0. If the parameter 'FILE' is provided at the module's instantiation, the 'note_table' gets populated with the data read out from the specified file. \n\nFunctionality wise, the module takes a 6-bit wide input 'i_note' that is used as an index into the lookup table. The data at the indexed location is provided as a 32-bit wide 'o_compare' output of the module, potentially effective for any forthcoming comparison operations in the design. \n\nInternally, the module uses one signal, 'note_table', which acts as a memory storage unit or a lookup table. The initialization of this signal is done in an initial block where, based on the condition of a non-empty 'FILE' parameter value, the file's hexadecimal data is read into 'note_table'. \n\nThere are two main blocks in the code: 1) the initial block which reads in the data from file (if provided) to the 'note_table', and 2) the continuous assignment block which assigns the output 'o_compare' the value of 'note_table' indexed by 'i_note'. This Verilog RTL module provides a flexible way to preload data for use in the design and to fetch these data based on an input index for further operations.",
