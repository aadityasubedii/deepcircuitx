    "block_comment": "The block assigns the value of the element in the 'note_table' array at index 'i_note' to the output 'o_compare'. This is done using the 'assign' keyword which continually assigns the value of the operation on the right side of the equals sign to the object on the left, creating a continuous assignment statement that's always actively monitoring and updating the value of 'o_compare'."
