Module name: channel_2_pulse. 

Module specification: The `channel_2_pulse` module is a digital signal processing component of a larger music synthesis system. It uses the `channel_2_note_sequencer` and `phase_generator` submodules to generate synthesized audio signals and sync pulses. 

The module has four input ports: `i_clk` (the input clock signal), `i_rst` (the reset signal), `i_tick_stb` (a strobe signal indicating the tick operation), and `i_note_stb` (a strobe signal for note-related operations). 

The output ports are `o_output` (the waveform of the digitized audio signal) and `o_frame_pulse` (a pulse signal likely used for system synchronization). 

Internally, the module uses signals like `w_top`, `w_top_valid`, `w_phase_delta`, `w_compare_valid`, `w_envelope`, `w_phase`, and `w_compare` to process inputs, generate phase information for notes, validate data, and produce output waveforms and frame pulses.

The specification comprises two main blocks: the `channel_2_note_sequencer` and the `phase_generator`. The `channel_2_note_sequencer` block is used to sequence the notes and generate note-specific outputs such as the envelope and phase delta. The `phase_generator` module is used to generate the phase value based on the phase delta coming from the sequencer block. 

Overall, the `channel_2_pulse` module encapsulates complex digital audio synthesis functionality, combining envelope and phase information to create digital audio waveforms and synchronization pulses.
