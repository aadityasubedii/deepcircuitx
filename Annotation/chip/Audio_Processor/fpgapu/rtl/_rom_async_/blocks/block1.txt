Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code is used to assign the value from a particular address of the memory array to the data wire/variable. The memory array is indexed with the 'addr' variable to access the specific memory location. 'Assign' statement here helps to continuously synchronize the data from the selected memory address to the 'data' variable.
