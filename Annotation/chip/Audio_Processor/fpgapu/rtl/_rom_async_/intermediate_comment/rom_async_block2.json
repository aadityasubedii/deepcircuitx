    "block_comment": "The given block of code is responsible for initializing a read-only memory (ROM) with user-provided data. When the FILE variable is not zero, the block indicates that it is creating an asynchronous ROM from an initialization file. The `$display` built-in method confirms this operation, printing out a string with the name of the initialization file. The `readmemh` function then reads hexadecimal data from the specified file and stores it into the memory. This ensures that the memory is initialized with the desired contents at the start of simulation. Thus, the goal is to preload a ROM with specific data for the simulation environment."
