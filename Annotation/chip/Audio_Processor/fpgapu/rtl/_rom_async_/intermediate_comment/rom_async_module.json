    "module": "Module-level comment: The rom_async module is a Read-Only Memory (ROM) with asynchronous read capability, implemented in Verilog. It utilizes an array of registers ('memory') as storage, parameterized by 'WIDTH' for data size and 'DEPTH' for number of registers. The 'addr' input port is used to index the memory and the 'data' at the corresponding index is sent out via the output port. If an initialization file is provided, it's used to preload the ROM storage using '$readmemh' function."
