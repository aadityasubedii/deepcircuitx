Module name: rom_async.
Module specification: The rom_async is a hardware module described using Verilog RTL code. Its primary functionality is to implement a Read-Only Memory (ROM) with parameterizable width and depth, and the capability to perform asynchronous read operations. The module takes an address input via the port 'addr', which serves as an index to access the contents of the ROM memory. The 'addr' is a wire type signal of a bit width equal to the base-2 logarithm value of the depth. The resultant data corresponding to the given address point is sent out through the output port 'data', which is a wire type signal with a bit-width set by the parameter 'WIDTH'. The module uses an internal signal, 'memory', an array of registers of size determined by parameters 'WIDTH' and 'DEPTH', which serves as the storage element for the ROM. The different blocks of code in this module include initial block that checks if an initialization file is provided and if yes, it reads the file into memory using '$readmemh' system function, and an assign statement that assigns the value at the memory address pointed by 'addr' to 'data'.
