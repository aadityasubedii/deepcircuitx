Comment: 
This line of Verilog code performs a right arithmetic shift operation. Specifically, the 'o_compare' output is assigned the value of the 'w_adjusted_output' wire after it has been right-shifted by two positions. This operation effectively divides the 'w_adjusted_output' by four and assigns the quotient to 'o_compare'.
