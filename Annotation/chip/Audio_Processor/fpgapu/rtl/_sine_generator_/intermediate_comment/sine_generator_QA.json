The input is a 32-bit phase, and the output is a 9-bit comparison value. Internally, the module reads precomputed sine values from a file (\"sine_table.txt\") and stores them into a 64-entry, 9-bit register array. The top two bits of the input phase determine the quadrant of the sine function, the next 6 bits serve as an index into the lookup table. The module also implements a mechanism where the index and the output values are adjusted based on the quadrant of the function. Finally, the output value is right shifted by 2 bits before it is assigned to the output port. Essentially, it can be thought of as a sine function generator implementing quadrant and amplitude adjustments."

Explanation: o_compare is a 9-bit output port from the module. It is the sine value corresponding to the input phase, right-shifted by 2 bits. This output value is essentially our sinusoidal data manipulated by quadrant and amplitude adjustments."

It is derived from the top two bits of the input i_phase, and determines which quadrant of the sine function we are in.\n\n2. w_index: This is a 6-bit wide internal wire.
