Module-level comment: 

The sine_generator module generates sine values from a pre-loaded lookup table, given a 32-bit phase input (i_phase). The quadrant and corresponding index into the table are calculated based off the top 8 bits of the phase. The output is a 9-bit value (o_compare) representing the lookup table value adjusted for quadrant and amplitude, right-shifted by 2 bits. Quadrant adjustment makes use of Verilog ternary and bitwise operators, ensuring accurate and efficient sine value generation.
