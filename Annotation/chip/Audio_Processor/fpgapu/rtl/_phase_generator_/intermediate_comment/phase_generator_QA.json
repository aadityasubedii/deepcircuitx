It uses a 32-bit register (r_phase) to accumulate the phase deltas upon each clock cycle to generate the current phase. The module also accepts a reset signal, which, if active, resets the phase delta to 0. Other inputs are a clock signal, binary flags indicating the validity of the phase delta input, and the phase delta input value itself. The module outputs the current phase and a strobe signal which basically indicates the accumulated phase value before the addition of the next phase delta."
