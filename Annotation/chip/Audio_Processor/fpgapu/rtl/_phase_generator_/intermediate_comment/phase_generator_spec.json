    "spec": "Module name: phase_generator. \n\nModule specification: The phase_generator module is a digital component designed to generate a phase signal based on the input phase delta, using a frequency of 440Hz and a sample rate of 25_000_000Hz. The module uses four inputs (i_clk, i_rst, i_phase_delta, i_phase_delta_valid) and two outputs (o_phase, o_phase_strobe). The 'i_clk' is a clock input that times the operations of the phase generator. 'i_rst' is a reset input that resets the phase delta to zero. 'i_phase_delta' is a 32-bit phase delta signal input, and 'i_phase_delta_valid' validates this input. The output 'o_phase' exports the current phase as a 32-bit signal, while 'o_phase_strobe' provides a snapshot of the phase before the next phase adjustment. Internally, the module employs three registers ('r_phase', 'r_phase_strobe', 'r_phase_delta') to hold and manage the phase details during computations. 'r_phase' maintains the current state of the phase, while 'r_phase_strobe' captures the phase prior to the phase delta addition. 'r_phase_delta' holds the phase delta value when the valid signal is true. The module\u2019s operation is primarily centered around a block of code in an 'always' loop, which syncs with every rising edge of the clock input, controlling the updating mechanism for the phase and strobe registers based on the reset and valid signals.",
