    "module": "Module-level comment: This is the phase_generator module, a digital component that generates a phase signal from a phase delta input. It employs four inputs and two output signals for its operation. Internally, it uses three registers ('r_phase', 'r_phase_strobe', 'r_phase_delta') for phase computations. The module's core logic lies within an 'always' loop, aligned with every rising edge of the clock input, where the phase and strobe registers are systematically updated. It effectively tracks and outputs the phase changes based on the given phase delta while providing phase snapshots regularly."
