Module-level comment: The 'pwm_tb' module serves as a testbench for a 'pwm' module and tests the generation of PWM signals with a resolution of 4 bits. Inputs include a clock signal, a 4-bit top value with its validity signal, and a 5-bit compare value with its validity signal. The module outputs the generated PWM signal and a cycle-end signal. There are no internal signals used and 'pwm' module is instantiated with implicit port connections via the '.*' connector.
