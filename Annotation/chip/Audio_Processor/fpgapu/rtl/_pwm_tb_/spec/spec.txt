Module name: pwm_tb. 

Module specification: The 'pwm_tb' module serves as a testbench for a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) module named 'pwm'. It operates by providing necessary inputs and monitoring outputs from the 'pwm' module. The inputs to the 'pwm_tb' module include 'i_clk', the clock signal that drives the synchronization of the digital system; 'i_top' and 'i_top_valid', a 4-bit top value for the PWM signal and its validity signal, respectively; 'i_compare' and 'i_compare_valid', a 5-bit threshold for determining the PWM duty cycle and its validity signal, respectively. The outputs from the module include 'o_pwm', the generated PWM signal; and 'o_cycle_end', a signal that indicates the completion of a PWM cycle. The module does not declare or use any internal signals. The main section of the module instantiates the 'pwm' module with a resolution of 4 bits. It connects all signals using the wildcard '.*' operator, implying all module connections are done with implicit port connections.
