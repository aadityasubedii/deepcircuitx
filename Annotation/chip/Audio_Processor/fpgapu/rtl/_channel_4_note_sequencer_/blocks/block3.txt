Comment: 
This block is a sequential circuit that resets or increments an envelope index. This operation is clocked on the rising edge of the input clock. When a reset signal or a new note signal is received, the envelope index is reset to zero. Otherwise, if a tick strobe signal is received, the envelope index is incremented by one unit, unless it has reached the maximum value of 9, in which case it remains unchanged.
