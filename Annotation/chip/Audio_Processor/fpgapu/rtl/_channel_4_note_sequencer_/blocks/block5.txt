Comment: 
This block is responsible for assigning the values of the internal register `r_phase_delta` to the output `o_phase_delta`. This operation is performed continuously, indicating the real-time nature of this wire assignment. It allows the system to monitor the phase difference captured in the `r_phase_delta` register, and output the same value on `o_phase_delta` for further processing or interfacing with other hardware systems.
