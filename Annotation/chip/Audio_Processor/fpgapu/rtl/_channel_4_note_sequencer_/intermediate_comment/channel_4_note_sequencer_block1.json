    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is performing a continuous assignment. It directly assigns the value of the signal `r_envelope` to the output signal `o_envelope`. Whenever the value of `r_envelope` changes, the same value is mirrored instantaneously to `o_envelope`. This is a simple part of a larger design, likely used for signal routing or transformation within a digital system."
