    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the assertion of a new note in a synthesizer or digital musical instrument. It implements this by creating a wire `r_new_note` which gets a boolean true value if both `i_note_stb` (probably note strobe indicating initiation of new note) is high and the note's duration count (`r_duration_count`) equals the note length (`r_note_len`). This ensures that each note will be held for its specified duration before transitioning to a new one."
