    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code serves to set the value of `r_envelope` based on the 4-bit index `r_envelope_index` value. It achieves this through a switch-style `case` syntax available in Verilog, with `r_envelope` being set to various decimal values multiplied by 2 for different indexes, ranging from 'd00 to 'd09. An exception is defined for 'd09, which sets `r_envelope` to 'd0, and a default case sets `r_envelope` to 0 for any other index."
