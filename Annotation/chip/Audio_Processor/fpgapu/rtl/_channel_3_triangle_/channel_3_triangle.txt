Module-level comment: 

// The 'channel_3_triangle' module in music synthesizer generates triangular waveforms. It employs a sequencer to compute top values and phase differences used in phase generation. The output is the adjusted triangular waveform ('o_output') and the frame pulse ('o_frame_pulse'). Noteworthy internal signals are `w_top`, `w_phase_delta`, `w_phase`, `w_triangle`, `w_adjusted_triangle`, and `w_adjusted_compare` which facilitate the generation of the final output waveform.
