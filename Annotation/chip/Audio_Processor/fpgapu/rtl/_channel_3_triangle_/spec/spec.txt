Module name: channel_3_triangle.

Module specification: The 'channel_3_triangle' module seems to be a component of a music synthesizer, specifically designed for generating triangular waveforms. Functioning with the support of a phase generator and note sequencer, it adjusts the waveform based on the phase information and provides synchronization indications through a frame pulse.

Input ports for this module include `i_clk` that serves as a clock signal reference, `i_rst` for bringing the system to an initial state, `i_tick_stb` to manage event timings, and `i_note_stb` to mark the start of a new note.

Output ports comprise `o_output` that carries the adjusted triangle waveform and `o_frame_pulse` that communicates a signal indicating the start of a new frame or cycle.

Internal signals used are `w_top` and `w_phase_delta` holding top value and phase difference respectively both calculated by the sequencer, `w_top_valid` serving as a valid indicator for the top values, `w_compare_valid` hard-coded to 1 but unused, `w_phase` holding the phase data produced by the phase generator, `w_triangle`, `w_adjusted_triangle`, and `w_adjusted_compare` used sequentially to eventually generate the final output waveform.

The module comprises different blocks like the sequencer and phase generator that work collectively to output the final waveform. The sequencer generates the top value and phase difference, which in turn are utilized by the phase generator to produce the phase data. This output undergoes transformations to ultimately generate the final triangular waveform depicted by `o_output`.
