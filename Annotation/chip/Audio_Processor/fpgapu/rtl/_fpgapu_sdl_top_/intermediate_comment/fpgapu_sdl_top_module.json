    "module": "Module-level comment: The fpgapu_sdl_top module is the topmost design component of an FPGA audio processing unit. It adapts input clock (i_clk), reset (i_rst), and 4-bit mixer (i_mixer) signals to generate an 8-bit audio sample (o_audio_sample). It employs an internal reset mechanism via 'reset_generator', and processes audio using a parameterized 'audio_processing_unit'. Audio sample output is extracted from its 9-bit wide output port, truncated to 8 bits for final delivery."
