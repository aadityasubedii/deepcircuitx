The fpga_audio repository is designed to facilitate a comprehensive TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) audio processing system in Verilog, coordinating audio data handling via encoding, processing, and decoding. The central component, the 'top' module, orchestrates the interaction between various sub-modules using a master clock and raw TDM input to synchronize the entire processing flow. It involves modules like 'TDM_input' for decoding input TDM data, 'audio_processing' for clipping audio signals, and 'TDM_output' for multiplexing processed audio back to TDM format. Essential to this setup are the 'audio_clkgen' for generating suitable clock signals (bit clock and word clock) and 'tdm_gen' for TDM signal generation. Testbench modules ('tb_top' and 'tb_tdm_input') provide environments for verifying the functionality of the 'top' as well as individual system components like TDM input processes and clock generation, ensuring each sub-module correctly interacts through well-defined internal and external interfaces. In essence, this repository encapsulates a robust framework for TDM-based audio systems, focusing on synchronization, signal processing, and modular testing.
