'bclk_cnt' is updated on the negative edge of 'bclk'. It is set to 62 if 'wc_ff' equals to '2'b01'(when a positive edge of 'wclk' arrives right after a negative edge of 'bclk') and otherwise, it is decremented by one. The 'wc_ff' is updated on the positive edge of 'bclk' where it shifts itself and concatenates 'wclk'. The 'FIX_DATA' is a constant defined in this module."
