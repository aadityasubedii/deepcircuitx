    "block_comment": "This block of code is a flip-flop, specifically a shift register primarily used for the synchronization of different clock domains. Upon every positive edge of the 'bclk' (base clock), the 1st element of 'wc_ff' array is assigned the state of 'wc_ff[0]', while the last position of the 'wc_ff' array is assigned the current state of 'wclk' signal. This configuration is used to reduce the risk of metastability and uncertainty when dealing with multiple asynchronous clock domains. It sequentially steps the 'wclk' signal through the flip-flop array, effectively managing the rate of clock domain crossings."
