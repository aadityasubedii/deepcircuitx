This block of code is utilized to generate a clock signal. Implementation-wise, this clock pulse generation is achieved using a forever loop. Initially, the 'mclk' signal is set to a value of 1, then a continuous infinite loop is initiated where after a delay of 40 time units, the 'mclk' signal is complemented, which creates a switching effect between 0 and 1, thereby serving as a clock pulse.
