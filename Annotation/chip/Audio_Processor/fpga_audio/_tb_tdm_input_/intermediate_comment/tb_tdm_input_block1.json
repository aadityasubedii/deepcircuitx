    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents an initial block, which is a procedural block that activates once at the start of simulation, and does not repeat. This specific initial block waits for a delay of 100 time units then ends its execution with no further actions or operations. The `#100;` statement represents the delay in time units. This code might be a placeholder for future functionality or used for debugging or testing by creating a delay before other operations."
