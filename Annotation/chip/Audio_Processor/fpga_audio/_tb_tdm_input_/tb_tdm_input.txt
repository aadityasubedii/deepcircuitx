Module-level comment: The tb_tdm_input module acts as a testbench for a TDM input system, interacting with `tdm_input`, `audio_clkgen`, and `tdm_gen` modules. Inputs, `mclk`, `cnt256_n`, and `tdm_in` include the master clock signal, a timing control and the TDM signals respectively. Output channels `ch1_out` and `ch2_out` are handled internally. `bclk`, `wclk` serve as derived clok signals, and `tdm_in` as TDM signal for processing. The design is structured into module instantiations, signal definitions, and operations in initial blocks.
