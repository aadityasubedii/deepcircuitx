    "module": "Module-level comment: // The audio_processing module performs audio clipping on two channels (ch1_in, ch2_in), outputting the clipped audio via two ports (ch1_out, ch2_out). It operates using a state machine (states: ST_IDLE, ST_CLIP_L, ST_CLIP_R) driven by the posedge of a clock input (clk). The state of the state machine and the time to output the processed audio is guided by an 8-bit input signal(cnt256_n). Clipping operations occur in ST_CLIP_L and ST_CLIP_R states for ch1_in and ch2_in respectively, stored in internal buffers (ch1_buf, ch2_buf) and passed to output ports when cnt256_n equals to '1'."
