It has two input channels (ch1_in and ch2_in) and two output channels (ch1_out and ch2_out). The core operation is controlled by a state machine with three states(ST_IDLE, ST_CLIP_L, ST_CLIP_R). During ST_CLIP_L, the module checks ch1_in and if it exceeds predefined limits, limits them to the threshold (clipping). It does the same checking and clipping for ch2_in in the ST_CLIP_R state. These values are buffered and outputted at the appropriate timing signaled by cnt256_n."
