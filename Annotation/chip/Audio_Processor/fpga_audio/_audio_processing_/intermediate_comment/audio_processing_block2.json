    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the output for two channels, ch1_out and ch2_out, based on a count mechanism from cnt256_n. The block is triggered on the rising edge of a clock cycle. When the counter cnt256_n hits a value of 1, it synchronously transfers the data present in ch1_buf and ch2_buf to ch1_out and ch2_out, respectively. Hence, the output channel buffers are updated based on the count from cnt256_n."
