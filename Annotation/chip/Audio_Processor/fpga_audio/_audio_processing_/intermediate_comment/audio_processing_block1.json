    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is essentially a two-stage state machine that clips input signal values. It operates synchronously with a clock signal in positive edge. In the ST_CLIP_L state, the input signal ch1_in is checked if it crosses upper or lower boundaries and is accordingly adjusted to remain within 16'h1FFF and 16'hE000. The 'ch1_buf' register retains the clipped value. In the subsequent state, ST_CLIP_R, the same operation of checking and clipping to boundaries is performed for signal 'ch2_in', with the clipped value stored in 'ch2_buf'. After processing the right channel, the state machine returns to idle state, ready for the next pair of signal value inputs."
