Module-level comment: The tdm_input is a TDM decoder that splits multiplexed data. It uses an 8-bit counter 'cnt256_n' and a master clock 'mclk' to control data flow. On 'mclk's rising edge, if 'cnt256_n' equals 0, bits [63:48] and [31:16] of internal 64-bit 'data_reg' are output to 'ch1_out' and 'ch2_out' respectively. If 'cnt256_n's lowest two bits equals 2, the TDM input data 'tdm_in' is shifted into 'data_reg'. Thus, incoming data is clocked, shifted or output based on 'cnt256_n'.
