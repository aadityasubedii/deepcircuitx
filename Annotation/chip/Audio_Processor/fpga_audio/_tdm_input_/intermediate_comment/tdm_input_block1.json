    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is designed for handling data distribution between data_reg and ch1_out, ch2_out registers. It is clock triggered; when the rising edge of mclk arrives and cnt256_n is equal to '0', the top 48 to 63 bits of then data_reg are sent to ch1_out and the bits 16 to 31 are sent to ch2_out. Meanwhile, when only the least significant two bits of cnt256_n are '2', data shifting occurs where the lower 63 bits of data_reg get shifted left, and the tdm_in input data becomes the least significant bit in data_reg. Other clock signals have no explicit output, simplifying the overall design.\n"
