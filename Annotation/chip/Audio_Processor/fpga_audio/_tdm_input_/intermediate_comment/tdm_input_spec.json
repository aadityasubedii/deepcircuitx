    "spec": "Module name: tdm_input. \n\nModule specification: The tdm_input module is a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) decoder that separates multiplexed data from different channels. The module operates based on a master clock (mclk) and a counter (cnt256_n), which is an 8-bit input. The module has three inputs: mclk, cnt256_n, and tdm_in. The mclk is the main clock signal which synchronizes the operation of the module. The cnt256_n input determines when to transfer data into the output registers and when to shift data into the data register (tdm_in). The tdm_in is the Time Division Multiplexing input data. \n\nThe module has two 16-bit output channels, ch1_out and ch2_out. The bits 63 to 48 of the data_reg register are mapped to ch1_out output, and the bits 31 to 16 of the data_reg are mapped to ch2_out output when cnt256_n equals 0. \n\nInternally, the module maintains a 64-bit register, data_reg, to store the data. Different parts of data_reg are mapped to different output channels depending upon the value of the 'cnt256_n'. The incoming TDM data is shifted into this data_reg at each mclk cycle when 'cnt256_n' equals 2. \n\nIn the code, the positive edge sensitive always block covers the functionality of this module by checking the value of cnt256_n to determine whether to update output channels or shift incoming data into the data register. When cnt256_n equals 0, the data from data_reg[63:48] and data_reg[31:16] are loaded into ch1_out and ch2_out respectively. And when the lower two bits of cnt256_n equals 2, tdm_in is shifted into the data register from the bottom, updating the current contents.",
