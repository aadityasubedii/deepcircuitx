Module-level comment: The tdm_output module performs Time Division Multiplexing on two 16-bit channels (ch1_in, ch2_in), outputting through tdm_out. Anchored to a clock signal (mclk), it uses an 8-bit counter (cnt256_n) to control operations. An internal 64-bit buffer (tdmo_buf) temporarily holds and manipulates input data. Functionality is achieved through state conditions - if counter is zero, buffer is refreshed with inputs; if counter's least significant bits are zero, buffer is shifted; else, buffer remains unchanged.
