    "spec": "Module name: tdm_output. \n\nModule specification: The tdm_output module is designed to perform Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) operations on two 16-bit input channels ch1_in and ch2_in. The input ports to this module are a clock signal mclk, an 8-bit counter cnt256_n, and two 16-bit data channels ch1_in and ch2_in. The mclk provides the synchronisation for the module's operations, by triggering operations on its positive edge. The cnt256_n counter is used to regulate the shifting and refreshing of data operations within the module, using different values to dictate the action the module takes on each positive clock edge. The data channels ch1_in and ch2_in provide the actual data that is multiplexed and output. The only output port is tdm_out, which exports the topmost bit of the internal buffer.\n\nInternally, the module uses a 64-bit register tdmo_buf, which serves as the temporary storage and main data manipulation block, holding and shifting the inputs from the ch1_in and ch2_in channels as directed by the mclk and cnt256_n signals. \n\nThe code itself is divided into several sections. One section handles the assignment of the output tdm_out as the topmost bit of the tdmo_buf. The main block operates on the positive edge of the clock signal to either refresh the tdmo_buf with new data from the input channels (when cnt256_n is zero), shift tdmo_buf's content one bit to the right (when the two least significant bits of cnt256_n are zero) or leave it unchanged under any other conditions. Consequently, a detailed understanding of the module is only possible by considering all these components in unison, as they work together to realize the module's core functionality.",

The module contains a 64-bit buffer named tdmo_buf. The module is designed for Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) where 16-bits from ch1_in and ch2_in are stored in the buffer alternating with an empty 16-bits. The first bit of the buffer is outputted through tdm_out. When clock signal is at a positive edge, the module checks the value of the counter. If the counter is at 0, the buffer is replenished with new 16-bits from each input channel. If the lower 2-bits of the counter is 0, the buffer moves all bits one place to left, and adds a 0 at the lower bit. On any other value of counter, the module does nothing."

Its primary role is to store and shift the data input from the ch1_in and ch2_in channels. Precisely, it stores 16 bits from ch1_in and ch2_in interleaved with two 16-bit zeros in the beginning. Internal signal tdmo_buf acts as the Time Division Multiplexing buffer. The signal tdm_out, which is the output of this module, is directly assigned as the most significant bit of tdmo_buf. The content and structure of tdmo_buf are determined by the value of input counter cnt256_n during a positive clock edge. When cnt256_n is zero, tdmo_buf will be reloaded with new data from input channels. If the two least significant bits of cnt256_n are zero, tdmo_buf will perform a right shift and bring in a '0' from the left. For other values of cnt256_n, the content of tdmo_buf remains unchanged. Thus, the internal signal tdmo_buf plays a crucial role in orchestrating and maintaining the Time Division Multiplexing operation within the module."
