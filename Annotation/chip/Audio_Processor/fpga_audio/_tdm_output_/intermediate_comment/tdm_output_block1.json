    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a buffer, `tdmo_buf`, for two different channels of input (`ch1_in` and `ch2_in`) using a counter `cnt256_n` as a reference. At the rising edge of the `mclk` (main clock), if the counter `cnt256_n` is at '0', the buffer is filled with inputs from both channels along with padding of zeroes. If the counter's last two bits are '0', instead of data from channels, the buffer is shifted, and a zero bit is inserted. In other cases, no operations are performed on the buffer."
