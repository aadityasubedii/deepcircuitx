    "block_comment": "The block of code functions as a counter that decrements its count by one at every rising edge of the master clock (mclk). Implemented as an always block that is sensitive to the positive edge of mclk, it subtracts 1 from the current value of r_cnt256_n, effectively handling the countdown operation. This implementation uses the \"<=\" operator for non-blocking assignment, which ensures that the update happens in the next simulation time unit and thus is suitable for sequential logic."
