Inside the module, there is a count process that is synchronous with the rising edge of the mclk. The module generates a byte-wide output (cnt256_n) that serves as a counter decrementing with each clock tick. The module also generates two other clocks - bclk is the inverse of the second bit of the counter, and wclk is the last bit of the counter. These generated clocks could be used for different audio timing purposes, typically for proper data transfer/sampling rates in audio processing."

The value is determined by the inversion of the second bit of the counter that increments on every posedge of the mclk.\n2. wclk: This is the word-select clock output. The value is determined by the most significant bit of the counter. This signal can be used to switch between left and right audio channels in a stereo system.\n3. cnt256_n: A 8-bit output that represents the current binary value of the decrementing counter.
