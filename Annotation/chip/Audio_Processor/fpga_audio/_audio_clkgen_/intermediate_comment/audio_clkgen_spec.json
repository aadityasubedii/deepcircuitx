    "spec": "Module name: audio_clkgen. \n\nModule specification: The audio_clkgen module is a clock generator that takes a master clock signal (mclk) as input and generates three distinct output signals: bclk, wclk, and cnt256_n. The module operates by initializing an 8-bit register (r_cnt256_n) and decrementing the counter on every positive edge of mclk. The output bclk is an inversion of the second bit of the counter, providing a bit clock that's inversely related to the count. The wclk is the most significant bit from the counter, offering a unique clock output that can be used to switch between left and right audio channels in a stereo system. The last output, cnt256_n, is the current binary value of the counter, which can be useful for debugging or observing the current status of the counter in real-time. Overall, this module plays a crucial role in providing distinct clock signals, each carrying useful information about different segments of the time frame based on the input master clock, for efficient data management and transfer in audio processing systems.",

Inside the module, there is a count process that is synchronous with the rising edge of the mclk. The module generates a byte-wide output (cnt256_n) that serves as a counter decrementing with each clock tick. The module also generates two other clocks - bclk is the inverse of the second bit of the counter, and wclk is the last bit of the counter. These generated clocks could be used for different audio timing purposes, typically for proper data transfer/sampling rates in audio processing."
