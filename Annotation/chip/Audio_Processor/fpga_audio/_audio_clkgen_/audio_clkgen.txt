Module-level comment: 

The audio_clkgen is a clock signal generator module for audio processing systems. It takes a master clock (mclk) as input and generates three outputs: byte-wide counter (cnt256_n), bit clock (bclk), and word clock (wclk). Internally, it uses an 8-bit counter (r_cnt256_n) that decrements on each mclk posedge. The outputs are derived from this counter; cnt256_n reflects counter's value, bclk is the inverted second bit, and wclk is the last bit. This design allows the generation of various clock signals for different timing purposes.
