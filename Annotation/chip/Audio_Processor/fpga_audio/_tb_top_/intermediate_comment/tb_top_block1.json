    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is an initial block that performs time delay operation. It waits for 100 time units before allowing any further execution of the code. The execution of further code is halted for 100 time units right from the beginning as specified by the '#100;' command which indicates the delay. Please refer to the rest of the code to understand the effect of this delay on the whole system operation."
