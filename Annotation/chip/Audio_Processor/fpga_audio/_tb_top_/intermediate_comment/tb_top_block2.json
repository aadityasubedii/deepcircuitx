    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to generate a clock signal. Initially, the digital signal 'mclk' is set to logic high. A forever loop is then started that toggles the state of 'mclk' after every 40 time units, producing a periodic clock signal. The clock period is 80 time units, and the duty cycle is 50%."
