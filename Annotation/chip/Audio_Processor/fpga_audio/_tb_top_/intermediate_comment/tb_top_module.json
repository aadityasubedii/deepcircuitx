    "module": "Module-level comment: The tb_top module serves as a testbench for 'top' and 'tdm_gen' modules in Verilog. Its functionality includes generating a master clock signal (mclk) that alternates every 40 time units. It contains two instantiated modules: 'top' and 'tdm_gen'. It interfaces with these modules through the internal signals tdm_in, tdm_out, bclk, and wclk. Two initial blocks manage the clock signal generation and provide a scope for test sequence implementation. Final functionality depends on the internal implementation of 'top' and 'tdm_gen'."
