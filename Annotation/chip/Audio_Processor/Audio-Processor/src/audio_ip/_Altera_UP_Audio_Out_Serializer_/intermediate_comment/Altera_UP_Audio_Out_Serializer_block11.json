    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the reset and write operations for the 'left_channel_fifo_write_space' on the triggered condition of a positive clock edge. When the reset signal is set, it clears 'left_channel_fifo_write_space', otherwise, it calculates the available space in the FIFO by taking the difference from its maximum size '8'h80' and a combined signal which includes 'left_channel_fifo_is_full' and 'left_channel_fifo_used', then assigns the result to 'left_channel_fifo_write_space'."
