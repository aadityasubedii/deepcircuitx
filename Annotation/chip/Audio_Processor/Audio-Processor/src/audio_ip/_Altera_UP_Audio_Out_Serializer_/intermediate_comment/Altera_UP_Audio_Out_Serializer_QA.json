It uses two synchronous FIFOs to manage and buffer the data for the left and right channels respectively. The module listens for audio data input and control signals to feed these FIFOs and, when signaled by the relevant clocks, samples data from the FIFOs, sending it to the data output serially. The serializer can also provide information about the amount of free space in each FIFO. If the module is reset, the serializer's output is held low and both FIFO space indicators are set to zero. The module is designed for a system with a main clock, a bit clock for driving the data serialization, and a left-right clock that alternates the sample clock between the left and right channels."
