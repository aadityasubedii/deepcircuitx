    "block_comment": "The block of code is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer for the audio output of the right channel. The FIFO buffer is created using an Altera user-programmable sync module. In operation, it writes data whenever 'write_en' is active and the FIFO isn't full, which is ensured by 'right_channel_data_en' and inverse 'right_channel_fifo_is_full' signals, respectively. The data written comes from 'right_channel_data.' Reading data is accomplished when the 'read_en' signal is activated. The buffer's status is accessible via 'fifo_is_empty', 'fifo_is_full',  and 'words_used' signals showing if the buffer is empty, full, or the amount of the buffer's current use. Lastly, 'read_data' provides the data read from the FIFO."
