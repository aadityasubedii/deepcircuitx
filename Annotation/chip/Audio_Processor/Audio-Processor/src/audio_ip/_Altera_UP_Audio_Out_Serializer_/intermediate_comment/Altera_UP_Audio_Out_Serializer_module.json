    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer is a Verilog module handling audio output serialization for left and right stereo channels. It leverages a pair of synchronous FIFOs for buffering, driven by a system clock, a bit clock, and a left-right clock. Input data, enabled by control signals, are managed within FIFOs and serialized based on clock edges for output. The module also provides FIFO space availability data. If reset, output and FIFO indicators are zeroed. Internally, signals manage data flow and control logic determination, while Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO instances cater to each channel's data synchronization."
