    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a synthesisable process that alters the boolean flag `left_channel_was_read` based on control signals. The process updates the flag on every rising edge (`posedge`) of the clock (`clk`). If the reset signal is high(`1'b1`), the flag is cleared (`left_channel_was_read <= 1'b0`). However, if the `read_left_channel` signal is high while `reset` is not, the flag `left_channel_was_read` is set to high (`1'b1`). Finally, if neither `reset` nor `read_left_channel` are high, but `read_right_channel` is, the flag is again cleared (`left_channel_was_read <= 1'b0`). This block defines the synchronised behaviour of the `left_channel_was_read` flag based on the behaviour of the `reset`, `read_left_channel` and `read_right_channel` signals."
