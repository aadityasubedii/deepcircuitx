    "block_comment": "This block of code defines parameters for the Audio Output Left Channel FIFO (First-In, First-Out) memory. It sets the data width to a predefined `AUDIO_DATA_WIDTH`, and the data depth to 128. It also assigns the address width to be seven bits. These parameters determine the capacity and performance characteristics of the FIFO memory."
