Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for the control of the 'serial_audio_out_data' signal based on the state of the 'reset' signal and the last bit of 'data_out_shift_reg'. When a positive edge of the 'clk' signal is detected, if the 'reset' signal is high, then the 'serial_audio_out_data' signal is set to low. Otherwise, it takes on the value of the last bit of 'data_out_shift_reg'.
