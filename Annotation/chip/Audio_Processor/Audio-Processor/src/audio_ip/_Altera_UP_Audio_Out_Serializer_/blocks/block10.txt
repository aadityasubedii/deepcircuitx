Comment: 
This block regulates the write space availability of a FIFO associated with the right audio channel. On every positive clock edge, the block checks for a reset signal. If `reset` is asserted, the `right_channel_fifo_write_space` is set to zero, effectively indicating that no space is left for write operations. If not under 'reset', `right_channel_fifo_write_space` is set to the binary value of '80' (128 decimal) subtracting the binary concatenation of `right_channel_fifo_is_full` and `right_channel_fifo_used`, to calculate the remaining space in the FIFO.
