Comment: 
This block of Verilog code implements a synchronous FIFO for the left audio output channel. The FIFO is initialized with `Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO` function, where `clk` and `reset` handle clock and reset signals respectively.

Writing to the FIFO is controlled by `write_en` and data is provided via `write_data`, both of which are linked with the left audio channel's data stream and only enabled when the FIFO is not full. Reading from the FIFO is performed when `read_en` is activated, sending out the data via `read_data`. 

Status of the FIFO is indicated through `fifo_is_empty`, `fifo_is_full` and `words_used` showing if the FIFO is empty, full, or the used capacity.
