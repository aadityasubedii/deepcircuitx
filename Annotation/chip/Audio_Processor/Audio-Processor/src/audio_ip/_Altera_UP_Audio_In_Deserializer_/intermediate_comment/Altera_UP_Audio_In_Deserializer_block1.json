    "block_comment": "This block of code performs as a shift register function for audio data input. Upon a positive edge of the clock, if the reset is active, it clears the audio input shift register by assigning it zero values. However, if reset is not active, the code then checks for a rising edge of the bit clock and the validity of audio input. If both conditions stand, the code initiates a shift to the right in the register and loads the serial audio input data into the leftmost bit of the shift register."
