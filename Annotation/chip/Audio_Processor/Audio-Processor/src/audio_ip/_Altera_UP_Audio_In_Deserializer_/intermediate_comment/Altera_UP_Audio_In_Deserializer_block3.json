    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the read space of the left audio FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer in a digital audio system. Upon receiving a positive edge clock signal, it first checks whether a reset signal has been sent. If a reset signal (1'b1) is detected, it clears the `left_audio_fifo_read_space` to '00', effectively indicating that the FIFO is empty. If no reset signal is present, it updates the FIFO status. The MSB (Most Significant Bit) of `left_audio_fifo_read_space` takes the full status of the `left_channel_fifo` indicating if the FIFO is full, and the lower 7 bits take the value of `left_channel_fifo_used`, providing the count of used space in the FIFO. This allows real-time monitoring and management of the available space in the FIFO buffer.\n"
