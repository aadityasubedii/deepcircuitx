It reads the serial audio input data using a rising edge trigger, and then stores this data into two FIFOs, left channel and right channel, if they are not full. In each clock cycle, the count of free spaces in each FIFO, and each FIFO's full condition are outputted. When reading is enabled and the FIFO is not empty, the audio data is sent to left or right channel. The module uses `Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter` and `Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO` in its implementation."
