    "block_comment": "This block manages the read space available in an audio FIFO buffer for the right audio channel. The block gets triggered by the positive edge of the 'clk' signal. If 'reset' signal is asserted, it clears the 'right_audio_fifo_read_space'. If the 'reset' signal is not asserted, the block updates the 'right_audio_fifo_read_space' based on 'right_channel_fifo_is_full' and 'right_channel_fifo_used' signals. The MSB bit indicates if the FIFO is full and the rest of the bits represent the amount of space used in the FIFO."
