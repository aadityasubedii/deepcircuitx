    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer module deserializes serial audio input data, managed by FIFOs for both the left and right audio channels. The functionality is synchronous with control signals including the clock, reset, channel synchronization, and enable reading. Data handling operations use internal signals for valid audio input, FIFO status (full/empty), usage count, and a temporary shift register. This module leverages Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter for bit counting and Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO for FIFO implementation, thus achieving an essential operation in digital audio systems."
