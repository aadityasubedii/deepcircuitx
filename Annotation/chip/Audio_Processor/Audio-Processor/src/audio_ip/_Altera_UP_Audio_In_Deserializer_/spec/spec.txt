Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer. 

Module specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer is a digital logic module responsible for deserializing serial audio input data. This Verilog module operates synchronously with an input clock and uses a reset signal for initialization. The functionality is facilitated by distinct input and output ports, and internal signals. Input ports include a set of clock signals, a reset signal, a done_channel_sync signal indicating completion of channel synchronization, a serial_audio_in_data for the audio data input, and read enable signals for both audio channels. The output ports comprise of available space indicators for the FIFO buffers of both channels and output data from left and right audio channels' FIFOs. Internal signals such as valid_audio_input, FIFO full or empty conditions signals, FIFO space usage signals, and data_in_shift_reg, a shift register, are essential for carrying out the deserialization, data storage, and synchronization tasks. The code consists of various blocks, including always blocks conditionally setting the states based on reset or valid audio input presence, and instantiations of modules `Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter` and `Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO` for bit counting and maintaining FIFO of the audio data of both channels. The module provides a crucial function of audio data management in digital audio processing systems.
