Module-level comment: The audio_and_video_config module manages audio and video configurations via I2C protocol. It uses an input clock and reset signal for operation synchronisation. Bi-directional data transfer is achieved using inout port I2C_SDAT and the data rate is controlled by output port I2C_SCLK. Internal signals manage I2C communication, data transfer, auto-initialisation, and acknowledgments. Three sub-modules (Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator, Altera_UP_I2C_AV_Auto_Initialize, Altera_UP_I2C) ensure smooth clock generation, initial configuration setup, and I2C communication respectively.
