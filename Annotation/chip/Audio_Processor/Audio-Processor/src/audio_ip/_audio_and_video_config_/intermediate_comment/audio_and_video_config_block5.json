    "block_comment": "The block of code sets parameters for a 400KHz Clock Generator module. The `COUNTER_BITS` parameter specifies the counter's bit-width, which is set to 10 bits, meaning this counter can increment from 0 to 1023. The `COUNTER_INC` parameter sets the value by which the counter increments at each clock cycle, here defined as the hexadecimal value '001', which is '1' in decimal."
