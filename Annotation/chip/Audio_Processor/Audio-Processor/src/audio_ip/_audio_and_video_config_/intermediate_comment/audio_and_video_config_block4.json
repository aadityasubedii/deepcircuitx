    "block_comment": "This code represents an instantiation of the Altera_UP_I2C_AV_Auto_Initialize module, primarily responsible for setting up an initial communication over the I2C protocol. It is driven by a 50MHz clock and a reset signal. The handshake process is controlled by the acknowledge, error clearing, and transfer complete signals. It provides means for data transmission using signal pathways such as 'data_out', 'transfer_data', 'send_start_bit', 'send_stop_bit'. Signaling an automatic initialization completion and error occurrence are also included in this module instantiation."
