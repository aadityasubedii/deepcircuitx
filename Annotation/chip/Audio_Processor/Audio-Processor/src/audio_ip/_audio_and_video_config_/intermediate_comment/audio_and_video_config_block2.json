    "block_comment": "This Verilog block describes the implementation of an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) controller using the Altera_UP_I2C module. It is responsible for implementing serial communication over an I2C bus. The module uses a 50Hz clock input and a reset signal. It has a 400KHz clock signal for I2C operations, control signals for issuing 'start' and 'stop' commands, and signals for sending data. The \"num_bits_to_transfer\" input dictate the size of the data transfer. Outputs include I2C data (I2C_SDAT), I2C clock (I2C_SCLK), and transfer complete signal which is raised once the data transmission is complete."
