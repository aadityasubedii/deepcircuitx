    "block_comment": "This block defines the instantiation of an Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator named Clock_Generator_400KHz. This module is designed to generate a slower clock signal based on a higher frequency clock. The original clock signal CLOCK_50 is provided as the source, and the new clock signal output is clk_400KHz. This block also manages the reset and enables operations for the clock signal via the reset and enable_clk inputs. Additional timing information is provided via the start_and_stop_en and change_output_bit_en signals, which indicate the middle of high level and middle of low level periods respectably. The rising_edge and falling_edge outputs are not connected."
