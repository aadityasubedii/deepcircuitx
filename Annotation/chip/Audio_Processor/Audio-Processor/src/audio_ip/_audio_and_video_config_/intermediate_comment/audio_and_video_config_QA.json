It handles the task of initializing audio and video settings, controlling the transfer of data, and handling the some timing signals for I2C communication. It contains parameters associated with audio in/out line configuration, sample control, active setting, data format, and power. There are specific initializations related to audio paths like ADC and DAC. The module makes use of two other modules: Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator for clock management and Altera_UP_I2C_AV_Auto_Initialize & Altera_UP_I2C for I2C communication initialization and control."

It is responsible for bringing the initial defined state back whenever required.\n\nOutput port: \n1. I2C_SCLK: This is the clock signal for the I2C bus.
