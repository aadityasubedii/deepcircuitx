Comment: 
This block of code represents a synchronous reset and automatic initialization logic for a data transfer operation. This always block gets triggered at every positive edge of the clock (CLOCK_50). If the reset signal is high, the variables 'data_to_transfer' and 'num_bits_to_transfer' are reset to zero. On the other hand, if the automatic initialization flag 'auto_init_complete' is low, the variable 'data_to_transfer' is loaded with 'auto_init_data' and 'num_bits_to_transfer' is set to 7, essentially preparing a byte of data for transfer.
