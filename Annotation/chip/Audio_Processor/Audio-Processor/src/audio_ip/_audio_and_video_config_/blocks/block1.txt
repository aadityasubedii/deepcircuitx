Comment: 
This block of code is primarily used to set the mode of operation for an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication bus in a specific hardware module named I2C_Controller. The mode of operation is defined by the value contained in the 'I2C_BUS_MODE' parameter which is either predefined or passed during the instantiation of this module. The `defparam` keyword in Verilog is used to explicitly set or modify the parameters of the instantiated modules, allowing for configuration changes at runtime.
