    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to control the signal of the start bit in a communication protocol. It uses a synchronous design as it's triggered by the positive edge of clk (clock). If the 'reset' or 'transfer_complete' signal is high, the code resets the 'send_start_bit' to low. However, if the 's_i2c_auto_init' signal equals to 'AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT', it sets the 'send_start_bit' to high, initiating the transfer."
