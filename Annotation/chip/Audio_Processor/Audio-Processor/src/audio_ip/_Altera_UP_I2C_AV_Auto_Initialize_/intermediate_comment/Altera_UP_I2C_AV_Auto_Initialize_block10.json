    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the data output processing in a sequential manner, driven by the rising edge of the clock. When the reset is active, the data_out will be set to zero. Otherwise, the data_out will be set based on the value of the variable `s_i2c_auto_init` - it regulates the transfer of data from `rom_data` to `data_out` in regard to I2C communication. Different data segments (byte-wise) from `rom_data` are selected for output under different auto initialization states, thus dynamically controlling the output byte segment from the ROM data.\n"
