    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to control the 'auto_init_error' flag in a synchronous system driven by the rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset signal is high or the clear_error signal is high, 'auto_init_error' is cleared or reset to 0. However, if the system is in 'AUTO_STATE_6_INCREASE_COUNTER' state and an acknowledge signal ('ack') is received, 'auto_init_error' is set to 1, indicating an error during the auto initialization process."
