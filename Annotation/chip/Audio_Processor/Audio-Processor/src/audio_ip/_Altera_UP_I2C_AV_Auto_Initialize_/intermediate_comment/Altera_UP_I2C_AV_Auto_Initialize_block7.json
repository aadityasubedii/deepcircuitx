    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a sequential logic circuit that controls a 'send_stop_bit' signal based on conditions of 'reset', 'transfer_complete', 's_i2c_auto_init' signals. At the positive edge of the clock, if the 'reset' or 'transfer_complete' signals are set, the 'send_stop_bit' is de-asserted (set to '0'). In the case where the 's_i2c_auto_init' equals AUTO_STATE_5_SEND_STOP_BIT, 'send_stop_bit' is asserted (set to '1'), which implies sending a stop bit to the I2C bus."
