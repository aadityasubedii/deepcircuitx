Comment: 
The block of code functions as a state change trigger in a Verilog design. Its role is to signal when a transfer has been successfully completed and the associated data is ready for processing. This is achieved through a logical AND operation, which results in a "change_state" signal only if both "transfer_complete" and "transfer_data" are asserted high.
