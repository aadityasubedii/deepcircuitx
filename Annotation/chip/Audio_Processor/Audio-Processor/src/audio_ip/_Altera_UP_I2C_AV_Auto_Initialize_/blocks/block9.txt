This block regulates the data transfer in an I2C automation process based on different states. On each clock cycle, if reset or transfer_complete signal is active, this stops data transfer by setting transfer_data to zero. However, it initiates the data transfer (`transfer_data` = 1) when the state machine enters specified stages of the I2C automation process (AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT, AUTO_STATE_2_TRANSFER_BYTE_1, AUTO_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE_2). Thus, managing data transfer based on reset, transfer completion and specific automation states.
