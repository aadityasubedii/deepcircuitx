This block of code checks if the automatic initialization is finished. It utilizes an assignment statement to set `finished_auto_init` to TRUE or FALSE based on whether `rom_address_counter` equals to `MAX_ROM_ADDRESS`. In other words, if `rom_address_counter` meets `MAX_ROM_ADDRESS`, which represents the end of the ROM, the initialization is marked as completed.
