Comment: 
This block of code manages the 'data_size' of an I2C data transfer. Upon receiving a positive edge clock, if a reset signal is detected, it initializes 'data_size' to zero. However, if the I2C auto-initialization indicates a start bit being sent or a byte being transferred, it adjusts 'data_size' to 6 or 7, respectively - presumably reflecting the corresponding bits in a data byte.
