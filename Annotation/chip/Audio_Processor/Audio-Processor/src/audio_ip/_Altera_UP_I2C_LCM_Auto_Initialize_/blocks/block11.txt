Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code handles the output of data based on specific states and conditions. On the rising edge of the clock cycle, if a reset signal is triggered, it resets the data_out to a byte of zeros. If in the state AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT, it fills the six middle bits of data_out with the six high-order bits from rom_data, while the rest bits are set to zeros. When in AUTO_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE_1, it directly passes the eight low-order bits from rom_data to data_out.
