This block implements a ROM (Read-Only Memory) data mapping function leveraging a "case" statement in a way it assigns specific predefined values to the 'rom_data' based on the 'rom_address_counter'. When 'rom_address_counter' ranges from 0 to 19, a concatenation of a 6-bit address and a predefined value (like LCM_INPUT_FORMAT_UB, LCM_POWER, etc., which are presumably defined elsewhere in the code) is mapped to 'rom_data'. For 'rom_address_counter' outside this range, 'rom_data' is set to zero.
