Module name: Altera_UP_I2C_LCM_Auto_Initialize. 

Module specification: The Altera_UP_I2C_LCM_Auto_Initialize module is designed to execute the initialization sequence for a Liquid Crystal Module (LCM), communicated via the I2C protocol. The process, governed by a finite state machine, sends start bits, transfers data, sends stop bits, and manages potential errors.

The initialization procedure operates by configuring multiple parameters such as input format, power, positioning, contrast settings, brightness offset, and gamma correction among others, which are sequentially extracted from a ROM based on a counter.

The module is synchronous relative to an input clock and can be reset with a reset signal. Inputs include clock (clk), reset, an error-clearing signal (clear_error), an acknowledgement signal (ack) from the I2C protocol, and a data transfer completion signal (transfer_complete). Relative to I2C protocol data transfer, a data transfer complete signal (transfer_complete) is also required.

The outputs include configuration data (data_out) to be sent through I2C, the size of said data (data_size), signals to commence data transfer (transfer_data), send start and stop bits (send_start_bit and send_stop_bit), and signals indicating completion of initialization (auto_init_complete) or if an error occurred (auto_init_error).

Internally, this module uses signals such as ns_i2c_auto_init (next state of initialization), s_i2c_auto_init (current state of initialization), rom_address_counter (reader address counter for ROM), rom_data (data read from ROM) and a flag for completion of initialization (finished_auto_init). The module uses multiple always blocks to manage the initialization process, ranging from the state machine transition rules to data preparation for I2C transfers.

In summary, Altera_UP_I2C_LCM_Auto_Initialize is a comprehensive module focusing on initialization of an LCM module through I2C protocol, operated by a robust state machine and necessary safety measures to handle errors during the process.
