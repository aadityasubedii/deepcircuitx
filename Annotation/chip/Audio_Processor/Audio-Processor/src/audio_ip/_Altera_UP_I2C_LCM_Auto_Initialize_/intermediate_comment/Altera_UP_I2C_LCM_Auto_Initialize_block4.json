    "block_comment": "This block of code is for indicating automatic initialization completion status. It is implemented by assigning the value of 'auto_init_complete' signal which becomes true when 's_i2c_auto_init' signal equals to 'AUTO_STATE_7_DONE', indicating that the seventh and final state of I2C auto initialization is reached, marking the completion of the automatic initialization procedure."
