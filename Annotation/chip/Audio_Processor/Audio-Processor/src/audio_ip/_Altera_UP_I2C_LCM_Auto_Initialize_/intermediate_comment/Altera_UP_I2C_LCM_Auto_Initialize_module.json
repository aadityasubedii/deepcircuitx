    "module": "Module-level comment: This Altera_UP_I2C_LCM_Auto_Initialize module manages the initialization of an LCM through the I2C protocol. It embodies a state machine that traverses through different states for sequential transmission of data from ROM based on a counter for configuration. Inputs include synchronization and control parameters for I2C data transmission. Outputs reflect the state of transmission, data being transmitted, and flags for initiation and error status. The logic is synchronous with an input clock and can be reset. Essential signals are deployed internally to maintain state and flow of the operation."
