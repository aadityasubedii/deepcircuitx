It operates using a series of states defined as local parameters, which guide the initialization process. This process includes sending start bits, transferring bytes, sending stop bits, and managing potential errors. The initialization sequence involves configuring multiple parameters such as the input format, power, start positions, contrast settings, brightness offset, gamma correction among others. All these parameters are sent in an order from ROM data as determined by a counter. Also, multiple outputs and signals are generated to indicate the progress of the initialization, completion and any potential issues. The module returns a signal when initialization is complete. Additionally, the module is synchronous with an input clock and can be reset using a reset signal."
