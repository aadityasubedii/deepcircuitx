    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code assigns the logical AND result of 'transfer_complete' and 'transfer_data' to the signal 'change_state'. This operation signifies that a state change should occur whenever a data transfer is both complete and the data value to be transferred is logically high. The use of the 'assign' keyword suggests this is a continuous assignment, meaning 'change_state' will be updated instantaneously whenever 'transfer_complete' or 'transfer_data' signals change."
