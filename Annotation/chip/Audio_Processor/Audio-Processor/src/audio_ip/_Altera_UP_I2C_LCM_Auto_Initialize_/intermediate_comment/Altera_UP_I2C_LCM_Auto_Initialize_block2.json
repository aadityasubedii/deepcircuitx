    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a condition that checks whether the initialization of Read Only Memory (ROM) is finished. It achieves this by comparing the current ROM address counter with the maximum ROM address, signaling that all addresses have been traversed and, thus, the initialization process is complete. If the rom_address_counter is equal to MAX_ROM_ADDRESS, the finished_auto_init will be set to 1 (true), otherwise it remains 0 (false)."
