    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling a ROM address counter based on system state conditions. On the rising edge of the system clock, the counter resets itself to the minimum ROM address (`MIN_ROM_ADDRESS`) if the reset signal is high. Otherwise, if `s_i2c_auto_init` is equivalent to the sixth auto state (`AUTO_STATE_6_INCREASE_COUNTER`), it increments the counter by one."
