    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the initiation of a sending operation in a serial protocol, most likely an I2C protocol. Upon the rising edge of the clock signal, the `send_start_bit` signal is reset to '0' if either of these conditions are true - when a reset operation is active or the transfer has been completed. If the state of `s_i2c_auto_init` is 'AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT', the `send_start_bit` is set to '1', essentially initiating a new data transfer."
