It has signals to indicate when the FIFO is empty (fifo_is_empty) or full (fifo_is_full), as well as a counter (words_used) to track the number of data words currently stored. The FIFO's data width and depth are configurable through parameters. It leverages the scfifo primitive of Altera devices for its functionality."
