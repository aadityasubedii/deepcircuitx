The module receives input data on a write-enable signal and outputs the oldest data stored on a read-enable signal. The implemented FIFO adheres to the synchronous design principles and operates based on the system clock provided at its clock (clk) input port. The module's action can be reset by using the reset signal. Data to be stored in the FIFO is received through the write_data input port and is written when the write_en signal is set high. When read_en is set high, the data is read from FIFO and presented on read_data output port. The module also has output signals indicating the FIFO status i.e., full (fifo_is_full) and empty (fifo_is_empty). The current data occupancy is presented on the 'words_used' port. Inside the module, scfifo primitive of Altera is directly interfaced with the aforementioned inputs/outputs to build the FIFO functionality, hence no internal signals are used. The depth and width of the FIFO are configurable with compile-time constants (parameters).",
