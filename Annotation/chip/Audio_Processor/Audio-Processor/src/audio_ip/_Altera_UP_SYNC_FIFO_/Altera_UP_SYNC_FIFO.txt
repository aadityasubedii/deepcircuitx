Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO is a synchronous FIFO memory module for Altera devices. The functionality includes writing data on high 'write_en' signal, reading data on high 'read_en' signal, and indicating FIFO status through 'fifo_is_full' and 'fifo_is_empty'. The FIFO keeps track of data occupancy by 'words_used'. This is achieved by directly interfacing with the Altera's scfifo primitive. The FIFO's size is defined by compile-time constants. No internal signals are used in this design.
