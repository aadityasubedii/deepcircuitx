Comment: 
This block handles the control of the variable 'current_bit' which appears to be used for transferring a certain number of bits during I2C communication. During a positive edge clock, if a reset is detected, 'current_bit' is reset to zero. If the transceiver is in the 'TRANSFER_BYTE' state and 'change_output_bit_en' is enabled, then 'current_bit' is decremented by 1. If the transceiver falls outside the 'TRANSFER_BYTE' state, 'current_bit' is set to 'num_bits_to_transfer'.
