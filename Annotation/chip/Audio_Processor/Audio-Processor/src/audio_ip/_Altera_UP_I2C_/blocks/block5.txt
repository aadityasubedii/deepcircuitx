Comment: 
The block of code serves as a synchronous reset and data loader in a state machine controlling an I2C transceiver. Triggered at the rising edge of a clock pulse, it resets the 'current_byte' to zero when a reset signal is high. Alternatively, when the I2C transceiver is idle or in a start bit state, it loads 'current_byte' with the input data.
