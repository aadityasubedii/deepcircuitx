Comment: 
This block controls the state transitions of an I2C transceiver module in a synchronous digital system. When the system reset signal is asserted (logic 1), it sets the I2C transceiver state to idle, otherwise, it assigns the transceiver to the next state (`ns_i2c_transceiver`). The state changes occur at the rising edge of the clock signal, ensuring synchronous operation.
