    "spec": "Module name: Altera_UP_I2C. \n\nModule specification: The Altera_UP_I2C module acts as an I2C integrated circuit controller to establish a communication protocol specifically for the Altera Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). It primarily manages data transfers, signal manipulations related to start bit, stop bit, data transfer and data read in accordance with the I2C specifications. Along with this, it sets a finite state machine to process start, stop, transfer, and acknowledge events. \n\nThe module has multiple input ports including main clock signal 'clk', reset signal 'reset', signal to clear the acknowledge bit 'clear_ack', a 400 KHz clock signal 'clk_400KHz', signals to initiate start and stop bit sequences, signals associated with data and bit transfers, and the number of bits to transfer. The output ports include I2C bus's data signal \u2018i2c_sdata\u2019 and clock signal 'i2c_sclk', control signal 'i2c_scen' for data signal, signal 'enable_clk' for enabling or disabling I2C SCLK, signals acknowledging data receipt 'ack' and completion of transfer 'transfer_complete', and data 'data_from_i2c' read from the I2C bus. \n\nThe module utilizes internal parameters and registers like 'I2C_BUS_MODE' for setting the clock mode and a set of pre-defined states constituting the Finite State Machine (FSM). It uses the 'current_bit' and 'current_byte' registers to hold the value of currently transmitting bit and byte, while 'ns_i2c_transceiver' and 's_i2c_transceiver' are used to control the state machine. \n\nThe Verilog RTL code is sequenced into block-level statements that assign values to output and internal signals based on the FSM. It predominantly consists of blocks to transition between phases of I2C data transmission, specifically to handle output bit changes, acknowledgment handling, data transfer from I2C, and operations related to execution of start, stop, transfer bytes and complete transfer. This provides the module its comprehensive functionality to act as a specialized I2C controller for Altera FPGAs.",

It primarily manages data transfers, signal manipulations related to start bit, stop bit, data transfer and data read in accordance with the I2C specifications. Along with this, it sets a finite state machine to process start, stop, transfer, and acknowledge events. \n\nThe module has multiple input ports including main clock signal 'clk', reset signal 'reset', signal to clear the acknowledge bit 'clear_ack', a 400 KHz clock signal 'clk_400KHz', signals to initiate start and stop bit sequences, signals associated with data and bit transfers, and the number of bits to transfer. The output ports include I2C bus's data signal \u2018i2c_sdata\u2019 and clock signal 'i2c_sclk', control signal 'i2c_scen' for data signal, signal 'enable_clk' for enabling or disabling I2C SCLK, signals acknowledging data receipt 'ack' and completion of transfer 'transfer_complete', and data 'data_from_i2c' read from the I2C bus. \n\nThe module utilizes internal parameters and registers like 'I2C_BUS_MODE' for setting the clock mode and a set of pre-defined states constituting the Finite State Machine (FSM). It uses the 'current_bit' and 'current_byte' registers to hold the value of currently transmitting bit and byte, while 'ns_i2c_transceiver' and 's_i2c_transceiver' are used to control the state machine. \n\nThe Verilog RTL code is sequenced into block-level statements that assign values to output and internal signals based on the FSM. It predominantly consists of blocks to transition between phases of I2C data transmission, specifically to handle output bit changes, acknowledgment handling, data transfer from I2C, and operations related to execution of start, stop, transfer bytes and complete transfer. This provides the module its comprehensive functionality to act as a specialized I2C controller for Altera FPGAs."
