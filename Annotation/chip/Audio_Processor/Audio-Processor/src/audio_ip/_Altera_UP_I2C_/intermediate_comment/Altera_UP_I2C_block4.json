    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for assigning the appropriate clock signal to the `i2c_sclk` line based on the `I2C_BUS_MODE` and the current state of `s_i2c_transceiver`. It utilizes the trinary operator (?) for conditional selection between two clock signals. When `I2C_BUS_MODE` is 0, the clock signal `clk_400KHz` is chosen; otherwise, `clk_400KHz` is assigned to `i2c_sclk` when the `s_i2c_transceiver` state is either `I2C_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE` or `I2C_STATE_4_TRANSFER_ACK`. In all other states, `1'b0` (low level signal) is assigned to `i2c_sclk` signal."
