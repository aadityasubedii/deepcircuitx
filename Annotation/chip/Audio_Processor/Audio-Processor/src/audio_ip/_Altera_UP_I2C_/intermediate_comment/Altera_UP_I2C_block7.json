    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the data received from an I2C system. On the rising edge of a system clock, it checks if a reset signal has been activated and if so, it clears the 'data_from_i2c' register by setting it to 0. If a reset signal has not been activated, it checks if a start or stop condition has been enabled and if the I2C transceiver is in the Transfer Byte state. If both these conditions are true, it shifts the 'data_from_i2c' register to the left by one bit and replaces the least significant bit with the latest data bit from the 'i2c_sdata' line."
