    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a finite state machine (FSM) for an I2C transceiver. Based on the current state, represented by `s_i2c_transceiver`, and different conditional inputs, such as `send_start_bit`, `send_stop_bit`, `transfer_data`, etc., it determines the next state (`ns_i2c_transceiver`). Notably, states involve operations such as pre-start setup (`I2C_STATE_1_PRE_START`), initiating start bit (`I2C_STATE_2_START_BIT`), data transfer (`I2C_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE`), acknowledgement transfer (`I2C_STATE_4_TRANSFER_ACK`), stop bit and operation completion (`I2C_STATE_5_STOP_BIT`, `I2C_STATE_6_COMPLETE`). In the idle state (`I2C_STATE_0_IDLE`), it waits for an operation."
