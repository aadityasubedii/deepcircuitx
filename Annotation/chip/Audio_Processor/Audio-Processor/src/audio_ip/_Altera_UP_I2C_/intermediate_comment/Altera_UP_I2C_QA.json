I2C is a communication protocol used in embedded systems to connect low-speed peripherals to an SoC and microcontrollers. It utilizes bi-directional data flow (i2c_sdata) and a clock (i2c_sclk) to synchronize the data transfer. \n\nThis module controls all necessary data transfers and signal manipulations concerning the start bit, stop bit, data transfer and data read, according to the I2C specifications. It sets up a state machine that transitions through states for start, stop, transfer and acknowledge procedures. \n\nFurthermore, the processing of data in and from the I2C and acknowledgment signals are handled within this module. The module appropriately changes the clock(I2C_BUS_MODE), and signals whether the transfer is complete or not. It also manages certain aspects like reset, clear acknowledgment, number of bits to transfer, etc. based on the inputs provided to it."
