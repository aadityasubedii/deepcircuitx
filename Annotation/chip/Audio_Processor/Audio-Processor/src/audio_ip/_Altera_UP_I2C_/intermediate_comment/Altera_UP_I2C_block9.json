    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for managing the scenario control signal (i2c_scen) for an I2C communication protocol. It uses a reset signal, a change output bit enable signal and a state machine signal for the implementation. The design uses sensitive to the positive edge of the clock to initiate the conditions. If a reset signal is received, it sets the scenario control signal to 1. If the change output bit enable signal is 1 and state of transceiver indicates the I2C has started, it sets the scenario control signal to 0. It will then again set the i2c_scen to 1 when transceiver's state indicates that I2C stop bit is received."
