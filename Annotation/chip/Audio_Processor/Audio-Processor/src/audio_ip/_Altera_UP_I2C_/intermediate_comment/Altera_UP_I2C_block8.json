    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the acknowledgement (`ack`) logic in an I2C transceiver system for a synchronous design. At each positive clock (`clk`) edge, the `ack` bit is reset if either `reset` or `clear_ack` is high. However, if both `reset` and `clear_ack` are low, `ack` is updated to the result of `i2c_sdata` XOR `I2C_BUS_MODE` when the `start_and_stop_en` is enabled and the `s_i2c_transceiver` is in the `I2C_STATE_4_TRANSFER_ACK` state."
