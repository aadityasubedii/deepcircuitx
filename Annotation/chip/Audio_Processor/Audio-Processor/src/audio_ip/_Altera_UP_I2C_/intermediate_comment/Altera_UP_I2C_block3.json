    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for setting the I2C serial data line (i2c_sdata) based on the current state of the I2C transceiver. Basing on the ternary operator checks for five different states like START_BIT, STOP_BIT, TRANSFER_ACK, and TRANSFER_BYTE and assigns i2c_sdata accordingly. When the I2C transceiver is in either the START BIT or STOP BIT state, or the TRANSFER_ACK state while reading a byte, i2c_sdata is assigned a hardware low. Otherwise, when the I2C transceiver is in TRANSFER_BYTE state while not reading a byte, i2c_sdata is assigned with current byte's bit. For all remaining cases, a high impedance state is assigned to i2c_sdata."
