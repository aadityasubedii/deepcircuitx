    "block_comment": "The block assigns the value of the 'transfer_complete' flag, indicating if a data transfer operation involving the I2C bus is complete or not. It does this by checking the state of the 's_i2c_transceiver'. If the state of the 's_i2c_transceiver' equals 'I2C_STATE_6_COMPLETE', the 'transfer_complete' is set to binary 1 (indicating completion). Otherwise, it is set to binary 0 (indicating that the transfer is not complete)."
