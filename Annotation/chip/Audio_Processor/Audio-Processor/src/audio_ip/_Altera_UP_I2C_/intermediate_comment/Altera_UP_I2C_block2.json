    "block_comment": "This block of code enables the clock signal for an I2C transceiver. It precisely checks the state of the I2C transceiver and activates the enable_clk signal when the transceiver is neither in the IDLE state (I2C_STATE_0_IDLE) nor in the COMPLETE state (I2C_STATE_6_COMPLETE), achieved through bitwise NOT operation and logical AND operation."
