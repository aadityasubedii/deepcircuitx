    "block_comment": "The given Verilog RTL code block analyzes the completion of an automatic initialization sequence. The block performs this function by comparing the ROM address counter with the maximum ROM address. If the current ROM address counter has reached the maximum ROM address, the automatic initialization is considered complete, which is reflected in the resultant 'finished_auto_init' signal."
