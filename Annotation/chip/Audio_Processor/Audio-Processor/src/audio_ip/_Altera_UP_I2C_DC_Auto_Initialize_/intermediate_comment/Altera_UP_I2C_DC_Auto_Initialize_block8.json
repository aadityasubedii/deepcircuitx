    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code governs the transmission start process on an I2C bus. Rather than always operating, the block only details actions to be carried out on the rising edge of the clock. If the reset bit is flagged or the data transfer is realized as total - as indicated by the transfer_complete bit - the start bit for transmission isn't sent. Otherwise, if the I2C bus is in the 'send start bit' state, this block will enable the sending of the start bit."
