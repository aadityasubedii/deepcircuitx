The module uses I2C bus (which is a two-wire interface - SDA (serial data line) and SCL (serial clock line)) to configure and command digital camera settings regarding parameters such as shutter width, gain values, row speed, column width, timing delays etc. The module has error handling capabilities in case the acknowledgment (ack) signal doesn't arrive corresponding to a sent data and it flags the completion of the initialization process. The specific camera settings are implied by use of identified parameters, each controlling different aspects of the camera's functions. The state machine logic manages the flow of the initialization process and its different stages, including transfer of data, waiting and handling of the responses. The completion is determined and signaled based on reaching a certain state in this process."
