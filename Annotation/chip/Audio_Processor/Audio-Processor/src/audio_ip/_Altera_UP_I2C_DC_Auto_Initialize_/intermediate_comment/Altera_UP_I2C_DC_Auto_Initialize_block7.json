    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the sending of a stop bit in a synchronous or I2C communication. The stop bit is reset when the external reset signal is high or when a data transfer has been completed, setting the send_stop_bit to '0'. If neither of these conditions apply and the I2C communication reaches the state AUTO_STATE_6_SEND_STOP_BIT, a stop bit is sent by setting send_stop_bit to '1'. The always block is triggered at each positive edge of the clock cycle, ensuring timely check and update of the stop bit status."
