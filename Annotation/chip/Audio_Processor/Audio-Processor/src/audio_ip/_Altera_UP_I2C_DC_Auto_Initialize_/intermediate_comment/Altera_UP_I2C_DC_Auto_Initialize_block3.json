    "block_comment": "This block of code performs the function of triggering a state change in a state machine upon a certain condition. It uses the 'assign' keyword to constantly evaluate the right-hand side expression and assign the result to the 'change_state' wire. The state change is initiated only when both 'transfer_complete' and 'transfer_data' signals are high. This is determined by using the logical 'AND' operator on these two signals."
