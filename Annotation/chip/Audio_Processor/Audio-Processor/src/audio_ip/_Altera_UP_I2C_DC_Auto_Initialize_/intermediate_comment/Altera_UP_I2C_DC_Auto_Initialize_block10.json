    "block_comment": "This block primarily controls the data output of the system based on the internal state of the I2C auto-initialization. On each rising edge of the clock, the module checks whether it's in a reset state or in one of the five operational states. If in a reset state, the output data is set to zero. If in operational states, it sends a start bit (8\u2019hBA), checks status, or transfers byte-wise data from the ROM data based on the specific state; more specifically, transferring either the 8 most significant bits (rom_data[23:16]) or the middle 8 bits (rom_data[15: 8]) or the 8 least significant bits (rom_data[ 7: 0])."
