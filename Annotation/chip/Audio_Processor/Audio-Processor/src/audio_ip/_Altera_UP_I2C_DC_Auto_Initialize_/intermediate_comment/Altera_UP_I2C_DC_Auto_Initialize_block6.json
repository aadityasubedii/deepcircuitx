    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing the 'auto_init_error' flag based on various conditions. It resets the flag when either a global reset or a clear error signal is high. However, if the 's_i2c_auto_init' signal is in AUTO_STATE_7_INCREASE_COUNTER state and an acknowledgement ('ack') signal is high, it sets the flag to high indicating an error. This flag management is done synchronously, at the rising edge of the clock signal."
