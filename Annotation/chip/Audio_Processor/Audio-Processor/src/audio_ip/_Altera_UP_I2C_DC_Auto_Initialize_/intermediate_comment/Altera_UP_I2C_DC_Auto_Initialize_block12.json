    "block_comment": "The given block controls the transition states of an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus in an automatic initialization process. At every positive clock edge, it checks for a reset signal. If the reset is asserted, the logic resets the state of the I2C bus to the AUTO_STATE_0_CHECK_STATUS state. However, if no reset is detected, it maintains its state by assigning the next state (`ns_i2c_auto_init`) to the current state (`s_i2c_auto_init`)."
