This block of code is a sequential event handler that updates a ROM address counter. It runs on the positive edge of the clock cycle. Upon reset, the ROM address counter is re-initialized to its minimum value. Else, if the I2C auto initialization process is in the state of 'AUTO_STATE_7_INCREASE_COUNTER', the ROM address counter increments by one. This process plays a critical role in memory address management during the operation of the system.
