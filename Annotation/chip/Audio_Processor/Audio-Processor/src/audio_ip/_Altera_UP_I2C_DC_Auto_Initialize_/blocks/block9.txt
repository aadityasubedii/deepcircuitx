This block controls the status of transfer data in a state machine driven I2C protocol operation. The operation of the block is clocked, meaning actions are executed on the rising edge of the clk signal. Firstly, if a reset command is received, it forcibly stops any ongoing data transfer by setting 'transfer_data' to 0. Beyond this, if a 'transfer_complete' signal is asserted, it also puts the data transfer on hold. In other states corresponding to 's_i2c_auto_init' being set to different 'AUTO_STATE' values (1, 2, 3 or 4), the 'transfer_data' is set to continue (being 1), indicating the start bit or a byte transfer in an I2C transmission.
