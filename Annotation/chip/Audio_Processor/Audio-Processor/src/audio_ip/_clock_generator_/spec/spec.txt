Module name: clock_generator. 

Module specification: The clock_generator is a Verilog module aimed at generating an audio clock signal (AUD_XCK) from a 27MHz main clock signal (CLOCK_27) using a phase-locked loop (altpll) component. It manipulates the main clock signal's frequency via the AUD_CLK_MULT and AUD_CLK_DIV parameters that set the multiplication and division factors, respectively, applied to the CLOCK_27. Input ports to the module are CLOCK_27, which serves as a base reference clock signal, and a signal used to reset the phase-locked loop, referred to as reset. Output from the module includes the adjusted audio clock signal (AUD_XCK), along with a signal titled audio_clk_locked, indicating whether the pll has achieved a stable frequency lock. This module uses an internally generated signal named audio_clk_locked to manifest the locked status of the phase-locked loop. The altpll component, named DE_Clock_Generator_Audio within the module, establishes this signal. The specification block containing altpll inputs and outputs outlines the phase-locked loop's behavior, and the defparam block set the clock division, multiplication, duty cycle, and other parameters. This design as a whole demonstrates a compact system to handle audio clock signal generation, suitable for implementation in larger, audio-centric digital systems.
