This is achieved by using a phase-locked loop component called altpll. The frequency of the generated audio clock is controlled by the AUD_CLK_MULT and AUD_CLK_DIV parameters, which specify the multiplication and division factors used on the main clock. The reset input is used to reset the altpll. The module also outputs a signal called audio_clk_locked which indicates whether the pll has achieved a stable frequency lock. This clock signal can be used for audio operations in a larger system design."

AUD_XCK: This is the output audio clock signal that is generated by the module. The generated clock is a frequency multiple of the input clock, controlled by the parameters AUD_CLK_MULT and AUD_CLK_DIV.\n2. audio_clk_locked: This is a status signal indicating whether or not the phase-locked loop (altpll) is locked or has achieved a stable frequency.\n\nExplanation: The output ports are the audio clock signal that's generated by altering the base clock, and a status signal indicating the stability of the generated clock."

This signal is a status indicator that is set by the altpll component (DE_Clock_Generator_Audio), showing whether the phase-locked loop (altpll) has reached the phase and frequency alignment with the input clock or not. The altpll sets this signal to high (1) when it achieves the stable frequency lock and low (0) otherwise. This signal provides important status information about the working condition of the altpll, allowing other parts of the larger system to detect and respond to any issues in the clock generation process."
