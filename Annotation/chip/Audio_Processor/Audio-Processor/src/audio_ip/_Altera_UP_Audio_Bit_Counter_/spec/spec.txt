Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter.
Module Specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter module functions as a digital counter for audio signal processing. The module inputs include system clock (clk), global reset (reset), bit clock rising edge (bit_clk_rising_edge), bit clock falling edge (bit_clk_falling_edge), left-right clock rising edge (left_right_clk_rising_edge), and left-right clock falling edge (left_right_clk_falling_edge). These inputs provide the timing and control signals needed for the counter operations. The lone output, 'counting', reflects the status of the bit counting process. Internally, the module uses a 5-bit 'bit_counter' register to keep track of counts, which gets decremented when the bit clock experiences a falling edge and the bit_counter is not at 0. A control signal 'reset_bit_counter' acts as an internal reset for the bit counter, triggered by either the rising or falling edge of the left-right clock. The main blocks of the code include two 'always' blocks that manage the operations of 'bit_counter' and 'counting' based on various clock and reset conditions, and an 'assign' block that generates the 'reset_bit_counter' signal. The operation of this module is synchronized with the system clock, left-right clock, and bit clock, and it provides crucial functionalities for digital audio processing operations.
