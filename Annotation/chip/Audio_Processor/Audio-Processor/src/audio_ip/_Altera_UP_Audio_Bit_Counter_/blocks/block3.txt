The code block handles a bit counter under certain conditions, controlled by clock (clk) signals and reset lines. Upon each positive edge clock event, if a high reset signal is detected, the bit counter resets to zero. If instead a reset_bit_counter signal is set, the bit counter initializes to a predefined constant value (BIT_COUNTER_INIT). Otherwise, provided certain conditions meet i.e., a falling edge on the bit clock and the bit counter being non-zero, it decrements the bit counter by one.
