    "block_comment": "This code block is used to generate a reset signal for a bit counter. The reset signal is assigned when either a rising edge or falling edge is detected in the `left_right_clk` signal. The `left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge` boolean signals represent the rising and falling edges respectively. The bitwise OR operator (`|`) in Verilog is used to trigger the reset action on the appearance of either edge, ensuring an immediate reaction when the clock changes state."
