    "spec": "Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter.\nModule Specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter module functions as a digital counter for audio signal processing. The module inputs include system clock (clk), global reset (reset), bit clock rising edge (bit_clk_rising_edge), bit clock falling edge (bit_clk_falling_edge), left-right clock rising edge (left_right_clk_rising_edge), and left-right clock falling edge (left_right_clk_falling_edge). These inputs provide the timing and control signals needed for the counter operations. The lone output, 'counting', reflects the status of the bit counting process. Internally, the module uses a 5-bit 'bit_counter' register to keep track of counts, which gets decremented when the bit clock experiences a falling edge and the bit_counter is not at 0. A control signal 'reset_bit_counter' acts as an internal reset for the bit counter, triggered by either the rising or falling edge of the left-right clock. The main blocks of the code include two 'always' blocks that manage the operations of 'bit_counter' and 'counting' based on various clock and reset conditions, and an 'assign' block that generates the 'reset_bit_counter' signal. The operation of this module is synchronized with the system clock, left-right clock, and bit clock, and it provides crucial functionalities for digital audio processing operations.",

The module takes in signals such as system clock (clk), system reset (reset), bit clock rising and falling edges, left-right clock rising and falling edges, and accordingly controls the 'counting' output. The bit counter is reset either by an overall reset signal or by either the rising or falling edges of the left-right clock. If the bit clock experiences a falling edge and the bit counter is not at 0, the counter is decremented. The 'counting' signal is logic 0 on reset and decreases to 0 when the bit counter hits 0. The counting starts or stops based on control signals, which are important in synchronized digital data processing."
