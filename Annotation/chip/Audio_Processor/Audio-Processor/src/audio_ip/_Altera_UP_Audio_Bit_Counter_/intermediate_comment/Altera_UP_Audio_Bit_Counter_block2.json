    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a counter controller, managing when a counter is active or inactive. When a positive edge of the clock signal is detected, the control flow checks if a reset signal is high or a reset_bit_counter is high, both set the counting off. However, when the bit clock has a falling edge and the bit counter is zero, counting also turns off. This controller effectively governs the operation of the counter based on these conditions."
