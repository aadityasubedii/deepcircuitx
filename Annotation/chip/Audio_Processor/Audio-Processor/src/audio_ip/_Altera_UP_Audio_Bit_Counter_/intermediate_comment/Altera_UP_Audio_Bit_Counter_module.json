    "module": "Module-level comment: // The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter module functions as an audio bit counter, using the clk, reset, bit_clk_rising_edge, bit_clk_falling_edge, left_right_clk_rising_edge, and left_right_clk_falling_edge inputs to control its operation. It has a single output 'counting' reflecting the status of bit counting. Internally, a 5-bit 'bit_counter' register keeps track of counts, decrementing on bit_clk_falling_edge, and resetting on either reset signal or left-right clock edges. The 'reset_bit_counter' wire signal manages bit_counter resets. The core logic is implemented in two 'always' blocks that update 'bit_counter' and 'counting' based on various conditions, with synchronization accomplished via the 'assign' block initializing 'reset_bit_counter'."
