This block of code handles the updating of `cur_test_clk` signal based on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. Specifically, during every rising edge of the `clk` signal, the current state of the `test_clk` signal is captured and assigned to the `cur_test_clk`. This process is fundamentally a state update operation and widely used in digital design where the state of a signal needs to be continually updated based on another signal's behavior.
