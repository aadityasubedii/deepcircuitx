Comment: 
This block of code is designed to detect both rising and falling edges in a test clock signal. The block uses a flip flop updated at each clock cycle to store the state of the test clock at the last clock cycle, and this is compared to the current state to detect changes. If a change is found and the current state is high, a rising edge is detected, and if the last state was high and the current state is low, a falling edge is found.
