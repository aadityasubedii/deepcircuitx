Comment: 
The block of code is a single line that creates a detection for a state change (or an "edge") in the test clock signal. This is done by employing an XOR ('^') operation between the current state (`cur_test_clk`) and the previous state (`last_test_clk`) of the test clock signal which gets assigned to the `found_edge` variable. The XOR operation ensures that an edge (either rising or falling) can be caught since the `found_edge` will be 'high' only when there is a change in the clock signal between consecutive time steps.
