It has three inputs: clk, reset, test_clk, and two outputs: rising_edge, falling_edge. The module stores the current value of the test_clk signal in the 'cur_test_clk' register and the previous value in the 'last_test_clk' register on every rising edge of the clock signal. The 'found_edge' wire gets assigned as the result of the XOR operation between cur_test_clk and last_test_clk, effectively indicating if a change of state has occurred between two clock cycles. If found_edge is TRUE and the 'cur_test_clk' is TRUE, it means a rising edge happened. Similarly, if found_edge is TRUE and 'last_test_clk' is TRUE, it means a falling edge happened. These results are then assigned to the module outputs, rising_edge and falling_edge, respectively."
