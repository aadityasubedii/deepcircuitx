    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code represents a hardware block implementation for detecting a rising edge of a test clock signal. The rising edge becomes high (or '1') when both 'found_edge' and 'cur_test_clk' are high (due to the AND operation), indicating a transition from a low signal ('0') to a high signal ('1'). This is effectively used to determine the timing events in digital circuits, where changes usually occur at the rising edge of a clock signal."
