    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nModule Altera_UP_Clock_Edge detects the rising and falling edges of the 'test_clk' signal. The main clock 'clk' controls the data flow, triggering updates to 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk' registers representing the current and previous states of 'test_clk'. Edge detection is achieved using the 'found_edge' wire which is the result of an XOR operation between 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk'. When a change of state (edge) is detected, 'rising_edge' or 'falling_edge' are activated accordingly. The 'reset' input exists but is unused in this implementation."
