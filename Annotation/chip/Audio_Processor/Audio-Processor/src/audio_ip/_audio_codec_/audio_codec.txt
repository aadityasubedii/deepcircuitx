Module-level comment: The 'audio_codec' module acts as a digital audio codec for left and right channels in a digital audio system. Using the main clock signal (CLOCK_50) and additional controls (read_s, write_s), it handles incoming (AUD_ADCDAT) and outgoing (AUD_DACDAT) audio signals. It employs edge detection for bit clock and ADC/DAC clocks, synchronization completion indicators, availability checks for both channels, and serializers/deserializers for audio data transformation. The complex logic ensures efficient and synchronized reading and writing operations for digital audio data.
