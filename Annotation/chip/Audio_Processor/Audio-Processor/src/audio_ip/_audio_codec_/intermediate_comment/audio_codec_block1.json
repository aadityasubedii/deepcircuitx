    "block_comment": "This block of code represents an instance of the Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer module audio output serialization. This module is responsible for encoding left and right audio channel signals into a serial data format compatible with an audio digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The module utilizes two clocks, bit_clk and left_right_clk, corresponding to bit and left-right-clock in the audio interface. During every rising or falling edge of the bit clock, new bit data is pushed from the left and right channel FIFO buffers. Notably, new data is only added when the left/right channel FIFO write space is nonzero, indicating the FIFO buffer is not full. The serialized output is made available through the serial_audio_out_data interface."
