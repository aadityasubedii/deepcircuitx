    "block_comment": "The block defines a synchronous reset functionality for a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) synchronization channel. On every positive edge of the given 50 MHz clock signal, the block checks if a reset signal has been issued. If the reset signal is set to '1', the DAC synchronization channel is reset by setting the 'done_dac_channel_sync' signal to '0'. Alternatively, if a falling edge is detected on the DAC's left-right clock signal ('dac_lrclk_falling_edge'), the 'done_dac_channel_sync' signal is set to '1', indicating completion of the DAC channel synchronization."
