    "block_comment": "The block of code is an instantiation of an Altera UP Audio In Deserializer in Verilog, which acts as a converter to translate serial audio data into parallel data. It handles both the left and right audio data channels. The module primarily uses clock signals to read the incoming serial audio data, distinguishing between the left and right channels based on the left and right clock rising and falling edges. It checks for the availability of read space in the left and right audio FIFOs before reading the respective audio data. The synchronized data for each channel is then generated as 'new_left_channel_audio' and 'new_right_channel_audio'."
