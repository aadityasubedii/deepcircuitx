    "block_comment": "This block manages the readiness of the system for read and write operations on two channels, namely left and right. Through logical AND operations, `read_ready` is assigned TRUE when both `left_channel_read_available` and `right_channel_read_available` have any value other than 0. Similarly, `write_ready` becomes TRUE when both `left_channel_write_space` and `right_channel_write_space` aren't 0. Lastly, the left audio channel is updated with the new audio data with `assign readdata_left = new_left_channel_audio`."
