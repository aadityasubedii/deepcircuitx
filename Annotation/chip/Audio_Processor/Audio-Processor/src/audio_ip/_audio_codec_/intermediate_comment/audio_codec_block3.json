    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is used to detect both rising and falling edges of the digital to analog converter's (DAC) left and right channel signal clock (AUD_DACLRCK). The detected edges are then assigned to the 'dac_lrclk_rising_edge' and 'dac_lrclk_falling_edge' signals respectively. It utilizes the Altera_UP_Clock_Edge component to achieve this, with the system clock (CLOCK_50) driving the component and a 'reset' signal available to reset the component when required."
