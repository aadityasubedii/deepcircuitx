It uses the Altera_UP_Clock_Edge component to detect the clock edges of the bit clock, ADC left and right clocks, and DAC left and right clocks. It uses the Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer to convert signal from serial to parallel for incoming data, and the Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer to convert signal from parallel to serial for outgoing data. 'read_ready' and 'write_ready' signals are raised when there is data available for reading and writing operations, and data is written to 'readdata_left' and 'readdata_right' from the 'new_left_channel_audio' and 'new_right_channel_audio', respectively."
