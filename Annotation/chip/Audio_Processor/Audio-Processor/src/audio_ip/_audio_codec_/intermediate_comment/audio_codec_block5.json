    "block_comment": "The block of code defines an instance of the `Altera_UP_Clock_Edge` module named `Bit_Clock_Edges`, serving as a clock edge detector. The function of this module is to detect the rising and falling edges of the `AUD_BCLK` signal, and its primary inputs include `CLOCK_50` as the system clock and `reset` as the reset signal. This block of code utilizes signals in the hardware design to determine changes to it. If a rising or falling edge of the clock (`AUD_BCLK`) is detected, it sets `bclk_rising_edge` or `bclk_falling_edge` high respectively. These outputs can then be used elsewhere in the circuit as needed."
