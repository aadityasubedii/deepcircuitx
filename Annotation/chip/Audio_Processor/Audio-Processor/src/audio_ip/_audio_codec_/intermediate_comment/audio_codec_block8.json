    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the synchronization of an ADC channel, depending on different conditions. If the 'reset' signal is high, it resets the synchronization (sets the 'done_adc_channel_sync' signal to low). However, if a rising edge is detected on the adc_lrclk (most likely the left-right clock signal of the ADC), it treats this as a completed synchronization and sets 'done_adc_channel_sync' to high. This makes 'done_adc_channel_sync' a flag indicating completed synchronization."
