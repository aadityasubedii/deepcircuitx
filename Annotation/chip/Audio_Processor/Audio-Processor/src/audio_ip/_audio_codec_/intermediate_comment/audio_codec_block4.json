    "block_comment": "The purpose of this block of code is to generate rising and falling edges for the ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) left/right clock (AUD_ADCLRCK). It employs Altera's UP_Clock_Edge module, which is designed to create and handle edge-triggered events. The input signals to this module are the main 50 MHz clock (CLOCK_50), a reset signal (reset) and a test clock signal (AUD_ADCLRCK). This block of code outputs two signals: a rising edge signal (adc_lrclk_rising_edge) and a falling edge signal (adc_lrclk_falling_edge), which correspond to the rising and falling edges of the AUD_ADCLRCK signal.\n"
