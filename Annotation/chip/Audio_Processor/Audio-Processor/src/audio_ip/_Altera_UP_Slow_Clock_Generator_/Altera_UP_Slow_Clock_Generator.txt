Module-level comment: This module, named Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator, generates a slower clock signal controlled by inputs 'clk', 'reset', and 'enable_clk'. 'clk_counter', a central internal register, is incremented or reset based on 'clk' and 'reset', respectively, to generate 'new_clk', the slowed-down clock. The 'rising_edge', 'falling_edge', 'middle_of_high_level', and 'middle_of_low_level' outputs provide synchronization pulses at various points in the clock cycle, all of which are determined from 'clk_counter'. The degree of slowing is regulated by parameters 'COUNTER_BITS' and 'COUNTER_INC'.
