The block of code is a clock divider. The code is activated at the positive edge of every clock cycle, the conditional statements inside check the state of the 'reset' signal. In case of a reset (when the reset is high), `new_clk` signal is set to zero. Otherwise, `new_clk` output takes the value of the most significant bit from the `clk_counter`.
