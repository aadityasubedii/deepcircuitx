The block of code is used for processing a reset or detecting a rising edge of a counter-based clock. If a reset signal is asserted (i.e., 1), it sets the 'rising_edge' to low (0). Otherwise, it uses bitwise operation on the most significant bit (MSB) of 'clk_counter' and 'new_clk' to detect a rising edge of the new clock input, 'new_clk'. For a rising edge, it updates 'rising_edge' to high (1), otherwise it remains low (0).
