It takes in an input clock and generates a slower version of this input clock, which is controlled by the parameters COUNTER_BITS and COUNTER_INC. The module also receives an enable input to control the clock generation, as well as a reset input to reset the entire system. Moreover, it generates an output signal that provides the new (slower) clock (new_clk), and four more signals to represent the rising edge, falling edge, middle of high level, and middle of low level of the newly generated clock."

The 'enable_clk' input is used specifically in this module to start the process of generating a slower clock from the input 'clk'. \n\nOutput ports: \n1. new_clk: This is the output of the slowed down clock.\n2. rising_edge: This signal produces a pulse at the rising edge of the new clock.\n3. falling_edge: This signal produces a pulse at the falling edge of the new clock.\n4. middle_of_high_level: This signal produces a pulse at the middle of a 'high' period of the new clock. \n5. middle_of_low_level: This signal produces a pulse at the middle of a 'low' period of the new clock.\n\nExplanation: \n'new_clk' is the slowed down clock which is the main output of this module. The 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge' outputs are helpful for synchronization purposes where some processes are required to be carried out at these edges of the clock. 'middle_of_high_level' and 'middle_of_low_level' signals are more specific and might be used for specialized synchronization tasks where operations must occur in the middle of a clock cycle."

This counter increments at every rising edge of the input clock 'clk' if the 'enable_clk' signal is high. This counter is used to generate a slower version of the input clock as it will overflow and reset to zero only after a number of input clock cycles defined by parameter COUNTER_INC.
