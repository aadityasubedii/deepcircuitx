    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for detecting a falling edge of a clock signal. It operates by analyzing the state of a reset signal, and the value of a clock signal counter. Upon encountering a positive clock edge, if the reset signal is high, it resets the 'falling_edge' register to zero. Otherwise, it assigns to 'falling_edge' the result of an AND operation on 'new_clk' and the XOR of 'new_clk' and the most significant bit of 'clk_counter', thereby detecting a falling edge whenever 'new_clk' goes from high to low."
