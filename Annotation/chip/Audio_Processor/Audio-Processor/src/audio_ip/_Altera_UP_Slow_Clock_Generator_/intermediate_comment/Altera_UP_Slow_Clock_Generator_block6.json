    "block_comment": "This block of code is a clock counter operated by a synchronous reset and an enable signal. The design is edge-triggered, with operations performed on the rising edge of the clock. The counter is reset to zero when 'reset' is high, and incremented by the constant 'COUNTER_INC' when 'enable_clk' is high."
