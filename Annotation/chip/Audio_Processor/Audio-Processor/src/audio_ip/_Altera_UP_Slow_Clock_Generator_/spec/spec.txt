Module name: Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator. 

Module specification: The Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator module is a hardware construct in Verilog RTL that is designed to generate a slower clock signal derived from the input clock. The module has three input ports: 'clk' which provides the base timing reference, 'reset' to bring the system to an initial known state, and 'enable_clk' specifically intended to enable or disable the process of generating the slower clock signal. The main output of this module is 'new_clk', which is the slowed down version of the clock input. Additionally, the module generates outputs 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge' that represent synchronization pulses at the rising and falling edges of the new clock, and 'middle_of_high_level' and 'middle_of_low_level' that represent pulses at the middle of a high or low period of the new clock, respectively. 

Internally, the module uses the signal 'clk_counter' as a counter to determine when to flip the state of the new clock, producing the slowing effect. The manipulation of 'clk_counter' essentially defines the different blocks within the module: the first block increments the counter at the rising edge of the input clock if 'enable_clk' is high, and resets it if 'reset' is high; the other blocks are dedicated to generating the output signals based on both the state of 'clk_counter' and 'reset'. The module parameters 'COUNTER_BITS' and 'COUNTER_INC' play key roles by defining the width and increment value for 'clk_counter' respectively, giving control over the extent of clock slowing.
