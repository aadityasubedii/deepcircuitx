Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles part of a memory read operation. More specifically, it determines whether a lower 32-bit memory block is being accessed, ascertains the active read data from two internal data among lower or higher, and assigns this to the output `rddata`. This is achieved using bitwise operations and equality checks for the address and read signal, in conjunction with internal signal pathways (`readdata_lower_intr`, `readdata_higher_intr`), to finalise the selection and alignment of the data being read.
