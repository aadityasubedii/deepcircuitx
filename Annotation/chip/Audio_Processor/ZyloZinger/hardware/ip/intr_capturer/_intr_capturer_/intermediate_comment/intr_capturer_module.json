    "module": "Module-level comment: \n//The intr_capturer module captures and stores interrupt signals. It accepts an array of interrupt signals (interrupt_in), a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (rst_n), an address signal (addr), and a read operation indication (read). It outputs read data (rddata) which represents the captured interrupt signals. The functionality is handled via internal signal registers that capture and store interrupt signals; these are accessed using logic determined by 'addr' for over 32 signals. The read data is passed through a synchronizing stage before sending it to rddata. Adjusts for interrupt signal amounts >32 using generate/endgenerate blocks to dynamically create necessary logic and registers."
