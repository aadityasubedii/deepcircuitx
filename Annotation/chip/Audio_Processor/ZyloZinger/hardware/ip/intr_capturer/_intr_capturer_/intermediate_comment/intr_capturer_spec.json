    "spec": "Module name: intr_capturer.\n\nModule specification: The intr_capturer, is a module that is designed to capture and store interrupt signals in a system. This module's functionality is geared towards reading the interrupt signals with certain wait states depending upon the system's requirements. The operations in this module are synchronous, changing state with the rising edge of the system clock. The system can be reset asynchronously via an active-low reset signal. \n\nThe module has five input ports: clk, rst_n, interrupt_in, addr and read. The clk port serves as the system clock signal, responsible for synchronizing the operations within the module. The rst_n port is an active-low reset signal, responsible for resetting the module whenever needed. The interrupt_in port represents the array of incoming interrupt signals. The addr port is the flag used to read data from the correct register when the number of interrupt signals (NUM_INTR) exceeds 32. The read port is a flag signal indicating a read operation should take place.\n\nThe module has a single output port, rddata. The rddata port outputs the interrupt data that has been read, making it available for use within the rest of the system.\n\nInternally, this module uses several signals. interrupt_reg, capture interrupt signal; readdata_with_waitstate, holds read data for synchronization; act_readdata, carries the actual read interrupt data, readdata_lower_intr and readdata_higher_intr, carry data from lower or higher interrupt registers; access_lower_32 and access_higher_32, serve as masks to access lower and higher 32-bits of the interrupted register respectively.\n\nCode is organized into blocks: register declaration and usage, address determination logic for reading interrupt signals, generation of read data and syncing it with system clock. \n\nFinally, the module is designed to be flexible to accommodate both more than 32 and less or equal to 32 interrupt signals by dynamically generating relevant registers and logic. This flexibility is handled within the generate/endgenerate block, which toggles between two different inputs and outputs based on the NUM_INTR parameter.",

It takes NUM_INTR number of interrupt signals as input (interrupt_in), along with a clock signal (clk) and an active-low reset signal (rst_n). It also takes input for an address (addr) and a read operation indication (read). The module outputs a 32-bit read data (rddata). \n\nThe interruption signals are stored in a register named 'interrupt_reg' which is then read out using generated logic. It can handle two different arrangements of interrupt signals: If the total interrupt signals are more than 32, it will generate two separate interrupt registers; one for the lower 32 bits and one for the higher bits. It then determines which of these registers should be accessed through the addr signal. If the total interrupt signals are equal to or less than 32, only one register is generated. \n\nThe generated read data then goes through an additional stage of register to synchronize it with the CTL and to provide a 'read data with wait state'. This data is then passed to the output. The module is synchronized to the rising edge of the clock and is reset asynchronously by the active-low reset signal. This module essentially provides a functionality of reading the interrupt signals with certain wait states."

Its width is defined by the NUM_INTR parameter. Each bit of this register captures one interrupt signal.\n\n- readdata_with_waitstate: This is the intermediate signal where the actual read data is stored for one clock cycle before being sent to rddata.

Depending on the address input, this data can come from either the lower or higher interrupts register, or both.\n\n- readdata_lower_intr: This wire carries the interrupt data from the lower interrupt register, i.e., the lower-order 32 bits of interrupt_reg register. Its value depends on access_lower_32 signal.\n\n- readdata_higher_intr: This wire carries the interrupt data from the higher interrupt register, i.e., the higher-order bits above the 32nd bit of interrupt_reg register.
