It takes NUM_INTR number of interrupt signals as input (interrupt_in), along with a clock signal (clk) and an active-low reset signal (rst_n). It also takes input for an address (addr) and a read operation indication (read). The module outputs a 32-bit read data (rddata). \n\nThe interruption signals are stored in a register named 'interrupt_reg' which is then read out using generated logic. It can handle two different arrangements of interrupt signals: If the total interrupt signals are more than 32, it will generate two separate interrupt registers; one for the lower 32 bits and one for the higher bits. It then determines which of these registers should be accessed through the addr signal. If the total interrupt signals are equal to or less than 32, only one register is generated. \n\nThe generated read data then goes through an additional stage of register to synchronize it with the CTL and to provide a 'read data with wait state'. This data is then passed to the output. The module is synchronized to the rising edge of the clock and is reset asynchronously by the active-low reset signal. This module essentially provides a functionality of reading the interrupt signals with certain wait states."

This module operates synchronously, meaning that changes to state occur based on changes in the clock signal. \n- rst_n: This is the active-low reset. Whenever it is low, the module will reset to its initial conditions.\n- interrupt_in: This is an array input of interrupt signals whose size is parameterized by NUM_INTR. These signals are the main data that this module is designed to read.\n- addr: This is the flag used when reading data to indicate which register to read from when NUM_INTR exceeds 32.\n- read: This is a flag signal which, if asserted, would indicate that a read operation should take place.\n\nOutput ports: rddata. \n\nExplanation: \n- rddata: This port outputs the interrupt signal data that has been read. It contains the final data to be read from this module, which is output back into the rest of the system. Accordingly, it is a register that stores the capture of interrupt signals."
