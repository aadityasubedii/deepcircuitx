    "block_comment": "The block of code handles the management of access to interrupts in a system that may have more than 32 interrupts. If `NUM_INTR` is more than 32, two interrupt registers are required (`two_intr_reg_needed`), one for handling the higher 32-bit interrupts and the other for the lower 32-bit interrupts. If `NUM_INTR` is 32 or less, only one register (`only_1_reg`) is required and all interrupts are considered lower, while the higher is padded with zeros. The respective `readdata_` variable is used to access the interrupt, with an emphasis on specific access during a read operation at a particular address."
