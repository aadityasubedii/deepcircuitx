    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for implementing a register that stores the value of an incoming interrupt signal. The function of this block is triggered either by a positive edge of the clock signal (clk) or a negative edge of the reset signal (rst_n). If the reset signal is not active (active low), the register (interrupt_reg) is reset to zero, clearing any previous interrupt signals. If the reset signal is active, the value from the interrupt input (interrupt_in) is stored in the register instead."
