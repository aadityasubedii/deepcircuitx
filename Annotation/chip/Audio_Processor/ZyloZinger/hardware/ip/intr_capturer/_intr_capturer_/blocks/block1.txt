This block of code is responsible for resetting or updating a signal, `readdata_with_waitstate`, in sync with the system clock or a negative-edge reset. The data update or reset depends upon the state of reset condition `rst_n`. When the reset is active (i.e., `rst_n` is `0`), `readdata_with_waitstate` is cleared to `0`. Otherwise, during a positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, `readdata_with_waitstate` is updated to the value of `act_readdata`.
