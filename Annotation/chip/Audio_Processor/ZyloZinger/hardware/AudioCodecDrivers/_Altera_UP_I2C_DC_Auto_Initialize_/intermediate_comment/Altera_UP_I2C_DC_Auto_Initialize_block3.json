    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code operates as a block that determines when a state change takes place in a given system. This state change is indicated by a single bit signal named `change_state`, which is assigned the result of a bitwise AND operation between `transfer_complete` and `transfer_data`. This means that `change_state` will only be assigned a high or '1' value when both conditions - the completion of a data transfer (`transfer_complete`) and the actual data being transferred (`transfer_data`) - are true. If either one of the conditions is not met, then `change_state` remains low or '0', indicating no state change."
