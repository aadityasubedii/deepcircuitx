    "block_comment": "This block of code is to handle system reset for an I2C interface implementation in Verilog. On every positive edge of the clock, if the reset signal is asserted, it forces the state of the I2C interface to return to its initial state, 'AUTO_STATE_0_CHECK_STATUS'. If the reset is not asserted, the state of the module 's_i2c_auto_init' is updated with the next state 'ns_i2c_auto_init'. This updates the system state based on the current situation, and ensures that the system can return to a known state after a reset condition."
