    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily manages the `auto_init_error` flag under different conditions in a synchronized manner. It operates at the rising edge of the clock signal. If the `reset` signal is active, the `auto_init_error` is cleared. Similarly, when the `clear_error` signal is high, it resets the `auto_init_error`. However, if the `s_i2c_auto_init` is in the `AUTO_STATE_7_INCREASE_COUNTER` state and the acknowledgment `ack` signal is true, it sets the `auto_init_error` flag."
