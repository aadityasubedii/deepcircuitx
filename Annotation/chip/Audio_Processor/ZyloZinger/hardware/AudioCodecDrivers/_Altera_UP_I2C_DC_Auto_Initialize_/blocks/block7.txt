Comment: 
This block of code effectively controls the signal for sending a stop bit in an I2C protocol communication. If a global reset signal or transfer completion signal is active, it resets the `send_stop_bit` signal. However, if the state machine reaches `AUTO_STATE_6_SEND_STOP_BIT` state, it sets the `send_stop_bit` signal, indicating the end of a communication sequence.
