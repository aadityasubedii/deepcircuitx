Comment: 
This block acts as a start bit controller for an I2C transaction in an FPGA. On every positive edge of `clk`, it checks three conditionals to control the `send_start_bit` signal. If the system is in reset or `transfer_complete` is high, `send_start_bit` is de-asserted to '0'. However, when in the state `AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT` indicated by `s_i2c_auto_init`, `send_start_bit` is asserted to '1'. Hence, the block commences the I2C transaction unless explicitly stopped or completed.
