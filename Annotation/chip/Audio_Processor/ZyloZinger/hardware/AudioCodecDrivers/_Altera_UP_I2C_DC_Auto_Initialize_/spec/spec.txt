Module name: Altera_UP_I2C_DC_Auto_Initialize. 

Module specification: This Verilog module is designed to perform automatic initialization operation of an I2C-based system using a tightly controlled state machine. Functionality includes generating start/stop data bits, handling byte transfer, managing error states, and tracking initialization progress. 

The module has the following input ports: 

1. clk: This is the system clock input, which is used to synchronize the steps in the state machine.

2. reset: Resets the state machine to its initial state.

3. clear_error: Clears the auto initialization error signal when set to high.

4. ack: This indicates that the current transfer is complete.

5. transfer_complete: Signaling that data transfer cycle is completed.

Moreover, it has the following output ports:

1. data_out: This 8-bit bus outputs the data being transferred during automatic initialization.

2. transfer_data: Indicates that there is data ready to be transferred.

3. send_start_bit: Signal that triggers the start of transfer of a data bit in sync with the clock signal.

4. send_stop_bit: This signal sets the stop of the data bit transfer.

5. auto_init_complete: Signal indicating the completion of the auto initialization

6. auto_init_error: Indicates errors occurred during the initialization process.

Internally, the module leverages various signals representing states of the machine states, ROM addresses, data, and control signals. The state machine has different states starting from 'AUTO_STATE_0_CHECK_STATUS' to 'AUTO_STATE_8_DONE'. Parameters 'MIN_ROM_ADDRESS' and 'MAX_ROM_ADDRESS' define the address limits of the ROM that are interfaced during the initialization. The signal 'change_state' determines when to move to the next state.

The module is mainly made up of always blocks that update the state of the machine and output signals based on clock edges providing it specific synchronization. An 'always @(*)' block is used to assign the next state based on the current state. The initialization parameters and data for the specific hardware are represented through a case statement within an always block.
