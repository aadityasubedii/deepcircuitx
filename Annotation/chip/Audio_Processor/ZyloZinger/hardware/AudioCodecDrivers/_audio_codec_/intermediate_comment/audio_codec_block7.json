    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the synchronization of a DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) channel. Upon each positive clock edge, it checks if a reset signal is active; if true, it asserts the 'done_dac_channel_sync' indicating that the DAC channel is not synchronized. However, if a 'dac_lrclk_falling_edge' signal is detected, it signifies a falling edge on the DAC's left/right clock which triggers the completion of DAC channel synchronization prompting 'done_dac_channel_sync' to be set true. This block implements a falling-edge detector for syncing a DAC channel."
