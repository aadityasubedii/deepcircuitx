    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the clock edge signals for the ADC_Left_Right_Clock_Edges module in Verilog. The module operates on a clock 'clk' and 'reset' signal. It tests the clock frequency via 'AUD_ADCLRCK', the tested clock signal. After successfully testing, it generates two output signals 'adc_lrclk_rising_edge' and 'adc_lrclk_falling_edge' which represent the rising and falling edges of the clock respectively. This setup enables the tracking of clock signal timing accurately which is crucial for correct system operation."
