    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code makes use of an Altera Core resource to detect both edges of the DAC Left-Right Clock. This is done by utilizing the Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module that has the ability to recognize and separately output signals at the rising and the falling edge of a clock signal. The incoming clock (clk) and reset signals are connected straight to the module. The specific clock under testing is AUD_DACLRCK. The resulting indicators of the DAC Left-Right Clock's rising and falling edges are output as dac_lrclk_rising_edge and dac_lrclk_falling_edge respectively."
