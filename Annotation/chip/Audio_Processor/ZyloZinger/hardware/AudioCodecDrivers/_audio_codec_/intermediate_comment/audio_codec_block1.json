    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a Verilog instantiation of the Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer, which is responsible for serializing audio data for output. Fundamentally, it operates by receiving audio data as input, and outputting the serialized audio data. Inputs include parameters such as clock signal, reset signal, clock edges for both bit and left-right channels, enable signals, and data for left and right channels. Notably, the module makes use of edge-detection for bit clocks and left_right clocks to achieve effective serialization. Additionally, the module delineates between left and right channel data, which are conditionally enabled based on the 'write' signal and the availability of write spaces for each channel. The serialized audio data is output through the 'serial_audio_out_data' port."
