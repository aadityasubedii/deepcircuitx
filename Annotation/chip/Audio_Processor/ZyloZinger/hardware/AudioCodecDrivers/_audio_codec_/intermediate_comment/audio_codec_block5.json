    "block_comment": "This block of code defines an instance of a clock edge detector module: Altera_UP_Clock_Edge, named Bit_Clock_Edges. It is used to detect the rising and falling edges of a clock signal (AUD_BCLK). This is achieved by correlating the primary clock (clk) and a reset signal (reset) with a test clock signal (AUD_BCLK). The detection results are reflected in two output signals: bclk_rising_edge and bclk_falling_edge, representing the rising and falling edges of the test clock respectively."
