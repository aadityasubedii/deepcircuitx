    "block_comment": "This block implements a synchronous reset logic for an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) synchronization process. At every rising edge of the clock, it checks if the reset signal is high and, if so, it sets the ADC synchronization process as not complete. If the reset signal is not high, it then checks for the rising edge of the ADC left-right clock signal (adc_lrclk_rising_edge) and, if detected, sets the ADC synchronization process as complete. The synchronization process completion status is held in the 'done_adc_channel_sync' signal. This block, therefore, manages the state of the ADC synchronization process."
