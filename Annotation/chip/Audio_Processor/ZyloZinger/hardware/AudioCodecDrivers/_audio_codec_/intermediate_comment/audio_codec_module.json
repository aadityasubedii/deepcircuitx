    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'audio_codec' module acts as a digital audio interface, handling read/write operations on audio data for left and right channels. Inputs include various control and data signals, while outputs provide read and write readiness, and the serialized audio data. Numerous internal signals, like rising/falling edge detectors and sync signals, ensure proper timing operation. Specific blocks perform clock edge detection, input audio data deserialization, and output audio data serialization."
