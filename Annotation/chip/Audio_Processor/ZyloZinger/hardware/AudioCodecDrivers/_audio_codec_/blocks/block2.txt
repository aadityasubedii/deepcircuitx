Comment: 
This block of Verilog code instantiates an Audio_In_Deserializer module from the Altera_UP_Audio_In library. The purpose of this module is to deserialize the audio input bitstream into Left and Right Channel outputs. Synchronization with the digital audio input bitstream is handled by clock signals and done_channel_sync input. The serial input data is received through AUD_ADCDAT line. The code enables reading from the left and right channel FIFOs only when there is available audio data. The deserialized outputs are available at new_left_channel_audio and new_right_channel_audio lines.
