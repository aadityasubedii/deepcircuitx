Module name: audio_codec.

Module specification: The 'audio_codec' module functions as an interface in a digital audio system, operating on several key inputs and outputs like the system clock, reset signal, read and write controls, and audio data for left and right channels. It also deals with certain internal signals critical to its operation. 

The input ports include 'clk' (the clock signal), 'reset' (the reset signal), 'read' and 'write' controls for read and write operations, 'writedata_left' and 'writedata_right' for inputting audio data, 'AUD_ADCDAT' (serial audio input), 'AUD_BCLK' (bit clock signal), 'AUD_ADCLRCK' (ADC left and right channel clock) and 'AUD_DACLRCK' (DAC left and right channel clock). 

The output ports include 'read_ready' and 'write_ready' (that indicate readiness of read and write operations respectively), 'readdata_left' and 'readdata_right' (output audio data read from left and right channels), and 'AUD_DACDAT' (serialized audio data output). 

Internal signals include rising and falling edge detectors for the bit clock and ADC/DAC left and right channel clocks, new audio data signals for left and right channels, signals indicating availability of data for reading from the channels and signals showing available space for writing data to the channels. Sync signals like 'done_adc_channel_sync' and 'done_dac_channel_sync' ensure the integrity of the read/write operations. 

The Verilog code is structured into multiple blocks, including clock edge detection blocks for bit clock and ADC/DAC channels, blocks for deserializing input audio and serializing output audio, sporting various signals for synchronization, read and write enable, space availability, data input and output. This modular structure supports efficient audio input-output operations in the digital audio system.
