It contains two synchronizing FIFOs for storing the deserialized left and right channel audio data. It uses a bit counter for validating incoming audio data. It reads the serialized audio input data, deserializes it and then stores the data into either the left or right audio channel FIFO, depending on whether the left channel or the right channel data is to be read. The FIFO can then supply the deserialized audio data to the system when needed. It also handles system reset, upper FIFO boundary (full condition) and lower boundary (empty condition)."
