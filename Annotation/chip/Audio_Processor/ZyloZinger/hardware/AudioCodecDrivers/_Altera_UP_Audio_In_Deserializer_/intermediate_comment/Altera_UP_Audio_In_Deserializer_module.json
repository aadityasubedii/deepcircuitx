    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer Verilog module deserializes incoming audio data for left and right channels and stores it in FIFOs. Audio input validation is achieved through a bit counter and data is stored sequentially, dependent on clk signals, in a shift register prior to deserialization. Full and empty status of FIFOs are tracked through flags, while read-spaces are updated appropriately. The module also handles system reset conditions. It interfaces through a number of inputs including audio data, enable and clock signals, while outputs include FIFO read spaces and deserialized left and right channel data."
