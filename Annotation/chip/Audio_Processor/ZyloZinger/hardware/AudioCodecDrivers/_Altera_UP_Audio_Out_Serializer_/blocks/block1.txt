The block of code defines parameters for the Audio_Out_Right_Channel_FIFO module within a Verilog RTL design. It sets the values for the audio data width, data depth, and address width of the module. The AUDIO_DATA_WIDTH is left undefined in this context, implying that it is a parameter or constant that's been defined elsewhere in the code. The data depth is set to 128, indicating how many data elements can be stored in the FIFO queue. The address width is set to 7, which represents the bit width of the address signal that's required to access the data elements in the FIFO.
