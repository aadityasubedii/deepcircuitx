Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer module serializes parallel left and right channel audio data into a serial output stream. It uses FIFO structures for managing data flow, with enable, full and empty checks for safe data writes and reads. Functionalities are clock-driven and reset-friendly. Two instances of synced FIFOs handle left-right channel operations uniformly, and an output shift register ensures correct data serialization. The resulting output is a serialized compatible audio data stream.
