    "block_comment": "The block manages the state of the 'left_channel_was_read' signal based on other control signals. It responds to the positive edge of the clock signal; on reset it sets the 'left_channel_was_read' to zero, indicating the left channel has not been read. It sets the 'left_channel_was_read' to true if the 'read_left_channel' flag is active, and resets the same if 'read_right_channel' flag is active. Thus, it helps in managing interaction between reading data from the left and right channels in a communication module."
