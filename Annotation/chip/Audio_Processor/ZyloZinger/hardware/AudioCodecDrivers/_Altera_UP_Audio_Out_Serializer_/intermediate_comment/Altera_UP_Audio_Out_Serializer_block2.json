    "block_comment": "The block serves as a synchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) queue configured for the right audio channel data. It uses the Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO module, a specific hardware design implemented on Altera devices. The fifo buffer accepts input (writing data) when 'write_en' is active and the FIFO queue is not full. The data written comes from 'right_channel_data'. When 'read_en' is active, it reads data from the FIFO queue, outputting it through 'read_data'. The status of the FIFO buffer, including whether it's empty, full and the number of words used, is reflected in 'fifo_is_empty', 'fifo_is_full' and 'words_used' respectively."
