It uses a bit clock and a left-right clock for the synchronization of incoming data, and checks for fifo availability (whether they're full or empty) before writing or reading any data. If fifo for any channel is full, it stops accepting data for that channel and resumes once there's space. On the output side, it persists the serialized audio output until new data comes in from either of the channels. The module also involves resetting of most values on receiving a reset trigger. The primary aim of this module is to serialize 16-bit parallel audio data (stereo - left and right channels) into a serial audio data stream suitable for output."
