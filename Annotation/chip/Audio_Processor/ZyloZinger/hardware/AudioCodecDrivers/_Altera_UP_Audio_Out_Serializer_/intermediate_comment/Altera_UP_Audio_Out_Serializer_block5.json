    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for the reading of the right channel of stereo audio data. It implements this function by using a Boolean AND operation to check conditions: read on the right channel happens only if two conditions are met simultaneously - i.e., the left-right clock is in a falling edge state and the left channel has been read."
