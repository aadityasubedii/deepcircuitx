    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code is a shift register that outputs audio data. The code accomplishes this by, at a system clock rising edge, checking a series of control signals and assigning the shift register's output accordingly. If a reset is triggered, all bits are cleared. Depending on whether the left or right audio channel is read, the corresponding data is loaded. On either clock edge of the left-right channel clock or the falling edge of the bit clock, the register performs a right shift, discarding the least significant bit, and appends a zero to the most significant bit."
