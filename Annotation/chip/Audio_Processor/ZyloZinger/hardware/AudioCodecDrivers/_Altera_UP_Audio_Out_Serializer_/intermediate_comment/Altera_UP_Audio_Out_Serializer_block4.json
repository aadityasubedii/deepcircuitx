    "block_comment": "This block is a instantiation of a synchronized FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory buffer dedicated to managing audio output data for the left audio channel of a system. The FIFO is operated by a clock signal (clk), and it can be reset with the reset signal. Writing data into the FIFO is controlled by the 'write_en' signal, which becomes active when there's data for the left channel and the FIFO is not full. The data to be written is provided by the 'left_channel_data' signal. Reading from the FIFO is controlled by the 'read_en' signal. The FIFO signals whether it's empty or full through the 'fifo_is_empty' and 'fifo_is_full' signals respectively, while the 'words_used' signal shows the current FIFO usage level. The data read from FIFO is sent through 'left_channel_from_fifo' signal."
