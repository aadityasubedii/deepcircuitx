    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for outputting serial audio data based on the state of the reset signal. When a positive edge on the clock signal (clk) occurs, the block checks the status of the reset signal. If it is high (logic 1), it clears the serial audio output data to ensure no residual data is present in the output. If the reset signal is low (logic 0), it transfers the most significant bit (MSB) of the data_out_shift_reg to the output. This data shifting operation allows the block to serially output the audio data."
