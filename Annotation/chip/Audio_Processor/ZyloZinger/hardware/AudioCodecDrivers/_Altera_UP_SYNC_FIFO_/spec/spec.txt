Module name: Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO. 

Module specification: The Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO module is a parameterizable synchronous First-In, First-Out (FIFO) memory buffer designed for use in digital logic and computing systems. It functions under the synchronization of a clock signal (clk) and its operation can be reset to its initial state. The module allows data (write_data) to be written into the FIFO when the write_en signal is asserted, and data can be read when the read_en signal is asserted. The status of the memory buffer, whether full or empty, can be checked using the fifo_is_full and fifo_is_empty output signals respectively. The number of words used inside the buffer can be monitored using words_used output port. The module has been parameterized with address width (ADDR_WIDTH), data width (DATA_WIDTH), and data depth (DATA_DEPTH).

Five input ports are present namely clk (synchronizing signal), reset (resets the operation to initial state), write_en (enables write operation), write_data (the data to be written), and read_en (enables read operation). The module has four output ports. fifo_is_empty goes high when FIFO is empty, fifo_is_full goes high when FIFO is full, words_used indicates how many memory locations are in use and read_data outputs the data being read from the FIFO. 

The module contains an instantiated component 'scfifo' internally referred to as 'Sync_FIFO'. The input and output signals integrate directly with this internal component. However, it doesn't explicitly declare or manipulate any internal signals and focuses to connect input and output ports of the module with those of Sync_FIFO.

Lastly, the defparam block sets specific parameters of the Sync_FIFO module, such as the intended device family, data depth, data width, checking of overflow and underflow condition, and usage of Embedded Array Blocks (EAB).
