Module-level comment: This Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO module is a synchronous FIFO memory buffer operating under a clock signal, with functionality to reset its operation. The FIFO handles write and read operations, signaled by write_en and read_en respectively, while monitoring its full or empty status. The design uses an instance of 'scfifo', referred to as 'Sync_FIFO', connecting its inputs and outputs with the module's ports. The FIFO is parameterizable by data width, depth and address width. Various parameters are set using the defparam block.
