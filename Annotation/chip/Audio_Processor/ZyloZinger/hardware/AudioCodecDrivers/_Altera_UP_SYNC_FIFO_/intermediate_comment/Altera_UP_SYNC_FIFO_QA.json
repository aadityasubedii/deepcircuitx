The buffer operates under the control of a given clock (clk) and can be reset to its initial state. The FIFO allows data (write_data) to be written into it when the write_en signal is asserted, and data can be read from it when the read_en signal is asserted. At any time, the full or empty status of the FIFO can be checked by looking at the fifo_is_full and fifo_is_empty outputs, respectively. The system also provides information about how many words are currently in use inside the buffer through the words_used port. The data read out is available at the read_data port. The FIFO is parameterized by data width (DATA_WIDTH) and depth (DATA_DEPTH).\n"
