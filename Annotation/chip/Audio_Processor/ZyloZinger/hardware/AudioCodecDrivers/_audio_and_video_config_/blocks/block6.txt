Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code is a continuous assignment statement that transfers data. The value of the variable 'auto_init_transfer_data' is continuously assigned to the 'transfer_data' wire, ensuring that 'transfer_data' always reflects the current value of 'auto_init_transfer_data'. This way of data transmitting realizes the function of data synchronization.
