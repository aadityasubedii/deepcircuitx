This block of code sets the operating mode of an I2C controller. Specifically, it uses the `defparam` keyword in Verilog to assign the parameter I2C_BUS_MODE to the I2C_Controller's I2C_BUS_MODE. This can be used to dynamically change the bus mode of an I2C controller within a larger system, depending on the value of I2C_BUS_MODE.
