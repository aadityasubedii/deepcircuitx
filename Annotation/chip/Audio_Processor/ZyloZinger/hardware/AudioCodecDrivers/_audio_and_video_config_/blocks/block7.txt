Comment: 
This block of code configures the data transfer with variable bit width upon reset or completion of auto-initialization. When a rising edge of the clock is detected and the reset signal is on, it initializes `data_to_transfer` to zero and sets `num_bits_to_transfer` to zero, thus blocking the data transfer. If the reset signal is off but `auto_init_complete` signal is zero, indicating that auto-initialization is not yet complete, then it loads `auto_init_data` to `data_to_transfer` and sets `num_bits_to_transfer` to 7, initiating a data transfer of 7 bits.
