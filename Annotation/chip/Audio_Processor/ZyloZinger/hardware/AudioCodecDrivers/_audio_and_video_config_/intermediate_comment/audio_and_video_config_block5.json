    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the value of the variable `auto_init_start_bit` to the variable `send_start_bit`. This operation is a continuous assignment in Verilog, which means the right hand side is continuously monitored and as soon as there is a change in the value of `auto_init_start_bit`, the same value is assigned to `send_start_bit`, making the latter always synchronized with the former."
