    "block_comment": "This block serves as an initial setup section for a digital audio controller in Verilog. It defines parameters such as minimum and maximum ROM addresses, configurations for audio line in and out \u2014 all related to audio processing tasks. These parameters are presumably linked to a module or process named `Auto_Initialize`, which likely uses these values to establish its initial configuration. These assignments set up critical values related to the audio path, power, data format, sample control, and device activity, thus configuring the functionality and connectivity for the digital audio controller."
