    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to assign the 'send_stop_bit' a value given by the 'auto_init_stop_bit'. It essentially connects these two signals in the hardware. Thus, when the 'auto_init_stop_bit' signal changes, the 'send_stop_bit' will immediately inherit the new value. The assignment operation is done continuously and automatically anytime the right-hand expression changes."
