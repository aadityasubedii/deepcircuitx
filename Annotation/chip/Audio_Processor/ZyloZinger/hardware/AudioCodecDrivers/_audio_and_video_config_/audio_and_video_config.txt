Module-level comment: The 'audio_and_video_config' module configures audio and video settings via I2C. It utilizes an I2C interface for data communication, internal signals for managing operations like start/stop bit transfer, data preparation, and acknowledgement tracking. It comprised of sub-modules: a 400KHz Clock Generator for clock signal, an Automatic Initialize for auto audio/video settings, and an I2C Controller for managing I2C communication tasks. Collectively, these ensure robust synchronization and efficient data transfer.
