Module name: xck_generator. 

Module specification: The xck_generator module is primarily responsible for generating a clock signal based on a reference clock. It contains an instantiated submodule named "xck_generator_0002". The module accepts two inputs - 'refclk', which is the reference clock signal, and 'rst', a reset signal used to bring the system to a known initial state. There are also two output signals. The 'outclk_0' is the generated clock signal, and 'locked' is a signal denoting when the generated clock has successfully synchronized with the reference clock. The module does not use or define any internal signals - all communication is carried out solely using its input and output ports. The functionality hinges heavily on the operation of the instantiated submodule 'xck_generator_0002'. Due to the lack of internal signals and blocks within this module, the specifics of the clock generation process will be determined by the workings on this submodule. The precise functioning can only be understood by examining the codes and comments within the instantiated submodule.
