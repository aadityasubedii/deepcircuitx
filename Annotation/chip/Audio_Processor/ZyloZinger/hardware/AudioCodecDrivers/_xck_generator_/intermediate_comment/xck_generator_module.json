    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, xck_generator, generates a derived clock signal from an input reference clock. It uses a reset signal for initialization and outputs the generated clock ('outclk_0') and a locking signal ('locked') which indicates successful synchronization to the reference clock. The clock signal generation process is realized through the instantiated submodule named 'xck_generator_0002'. However, since the interior workings of this submodule aren't described, detailed understanding of the clock generation process resides within this submodule's implementation."
