    "block_comment": "This block of code essentially implements a rising_edge detection logic for a signal. Whenever the reset is asserted, it synchronously resets the rising_edge signal. Otherwise, it checks a specific bit of clk_counter (determined by COUNTER_BITS) with the new_clk input. If these two are unequal and new_clk is low, it asserts the rising_edge signal. Hence, the block is functioning as a rising edge detector for the new clock signal based on a particular bit of the clk_counter."
