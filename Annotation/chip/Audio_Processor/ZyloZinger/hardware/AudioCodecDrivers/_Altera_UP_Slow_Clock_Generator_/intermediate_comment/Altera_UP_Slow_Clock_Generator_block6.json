    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a clock counter. Upon receiving a positive edge trigger from a clock signal, it first handles a reset condition: if 'reset' signal is high, it resets the 'clk_counter' to zero. If not, then it checks for an enabled clock: if the 'enable_clk' signal is high, it increments 'clk_counter' by 'COUNTER_INC'. This is typically used for frequency division or creating a delay."
