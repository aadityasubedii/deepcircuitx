It takes an input clock and outputs a slower clock signal (new_clk), defined by the values of COUNTER_BITS and COUNTER_INC. It also generates signals signifying the rising_edge and falling_edge of the new clock signal. Further, it determines the middle_of_high_level and middle_of_low_level of the clock signal by analyzing the clock counter's bits.
