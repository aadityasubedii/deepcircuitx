Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator is a digital clock manipulation module that outputs a slower clock signal from a given input clock. It monitors clock edges, and determines mid-level periods. Manipulation is achieved via a clock counter (clk_counter), incrementing per input clock cycle when enabled and not resetting. Output signals are derived from clk_counter, reset, and bitwise operations. Module functionalities are segmented into 'always' blocks, driven by the rising edge of the input clock.
