Comment: 
The block of code is a falling edge detector, triggered by the rising edge of a clock signal. When a reset signal is made active, the falling_edge output is immediately set to logic 0. During normal operation (when the reset is not active), this block generates a single clock pulse (falling_edge) on a falling edge of 'new_clk' by comparing the previous clock state (clk_counter[COUNTER_BITS]) with the current state (new_clk) only when the current clock state is high.
