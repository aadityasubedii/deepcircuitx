Module name: xck_generator_0002. 

Module specification: The xck_generator_0002 module is a hardware design in Verilog used to create a clock signal with a specific frequency using a Phase Locked Loop (PLL). This module uses an Altera PLL module for generating the clock signal. 

The design comprises of two input ports: 'refclk' and 'rst'. The 'refclk' is a reference clock frequency serving as the base frequency for the PLL. The 'rst' port serves as a reset signal for the PLL module. There are also two output ports: 'outclk_0' and 'locked'. 'outclk_0' is the output clock signal generated by the PLL with a frequency of 12.288000 MHz. The 'locked' output port is a status signal indicating when the PLL has achieved phase and frequency lock, ensuring that the output frequency is stable and matches the desired frequency.

There are no explicitly defined internal user signals in this design. Signals are, however, defined as part of the Altera's PLL module instantiation. These signals internally control the functioning and parameters of the PLL module and are not exposed outside.

The module mainly consists of an Altera PLL instantiated in it with a specific configuration to meet the requirements. The PLL is set to work in direct operation mode configuring the output clock frequency to 12.288000 MHz with a reference clock frequency of 50.0 MHz. The PLL operates in a fractional_vco_multiplier mode that suggests the output frequency could be a non-integer multiple of the input frequency. The design doesn't use phase shift and keeps all unused output clocks at a frequency of 0 MHz.
