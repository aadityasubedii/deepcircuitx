Module-level comment: The xck_generator_0002 module uses an Altera PLL instance to create an output clock signal with the frequency of 12.288000 MHz from a reference clock of 50.0 MHz. It utilizes direct operation mode, fractional multiplication, and handles reset control. Features such as phase shift and extra output clocks remain unused, configured to 0 MHz. Output 'locked' indicates the achievement of stable, desired output frequency.
