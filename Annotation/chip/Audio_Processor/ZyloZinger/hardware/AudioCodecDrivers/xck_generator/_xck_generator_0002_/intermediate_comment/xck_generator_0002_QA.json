This module uses an Altera PLL module and the input reference clock 'refclk' frequency is set to 50.0 MHz. The PLL is intended to generate an output clock 'outclk_0' with the frequency of 12.288000 MHz. It has a reset signal 'rst' and a 'locked' output to indicate when the PLL has achieved phase and frequency lock. It is also set up to generate several other clock signals, but all of these are currently configured to output 0 MHz. The fractional_vco_multiplier attribute of the PLL is set to true, suggesting the output frequency can be a non-integer multiple of the input frequency."
