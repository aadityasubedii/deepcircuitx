Comment: 
This block of code controls the transmission of the stop bit signal in a serial communication interface. The stop bit is typically used to indicate the end of a data packet. If a reset signal is detected or the transfer has completed, the send_stop_bit is deasserted to '0'. However, when the state machine s_i2c_auto_init enters AUTO_STATE_5_SEND_STOP_BIT state, the stop bit is asserted to '1', indicating where the end of the data packet is in the serial interface.
