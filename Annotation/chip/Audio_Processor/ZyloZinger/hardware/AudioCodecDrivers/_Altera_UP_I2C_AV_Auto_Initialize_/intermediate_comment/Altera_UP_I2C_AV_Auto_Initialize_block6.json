    "block_comment": "The block monitors the system's conditions and manages the 'auto_init_error' signal accordingly. At each rising edge of the 'clk' signal, this block checks three conditions. If the 'reset' signal is high or 'clear_error' signal is high, it sets the 'auto_init_error' signal to low, effectively resetting the error flag. However, if the 's_i2c_auto_init' signal indicates that the AUTO_STATE_6_INCREASE_COUNTER state has been achieved and an acknowledgment 'ack' signal is received, the block sets the 'auto_init_error' to high, signalling that an error occurred during automatic initialization."
