    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code block is involved with state control, specifically, it triggers a state change condition. Its function is to produce a signal, \"change_state\", once a data transfer is successfully completed. This condition is implemented by the logical AND operation between the signals \"transfer_complete\" and \"transfer_data\". If both signals are '1', indicating that the data transfer has been completed, then only it will assign '1' to \"change_state\" else it will assign '0'. If \"change_state\" is '1', it will trigger the necessary actions in the subsequent processes for a state transition."
