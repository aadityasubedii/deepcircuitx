    "block_comment": "The block primarily handles data transfer control in a synchronous design environment. It reacts to different digital signals and commands, resetting or initiating data transfer based on the status signals. When the reset signal or transfer_complete signal arrives, it deactivates data transfer. If it receives different stages of an automatic i2c initialization (represented as AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT, AUTO_STATE_2_TRANSFER_BYTE_1, and AUTO_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE_2), it initiates the data transfer. Implementation relies on an always block designed to be clock-sensitive, indicating that these operations happen synchronously with each clock pulse."
