    "block_comment": "The given hardware design block in Verilog code primarily functions for flagging the completion of the automatic initialization process. It does this by evaluating if the 'rom_address_counter' reaches 'MAX_ROM_ADDRESS'. Specifically, it uses the 'assign' keyword to effectively assign boolean value to the 'finished_auto_init' flag when 'rom_address_counter' equals 'MAX_ROM_ADDRESS'. The flag then signals that the reading process of ROM contents has been completed up to the maximum address limit.\n"
