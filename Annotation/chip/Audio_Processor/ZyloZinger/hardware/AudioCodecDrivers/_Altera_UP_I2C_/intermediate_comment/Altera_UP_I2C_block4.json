    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to assign the appropriate clock source to the I2C serial clock line, 'i2c_sclk'. This is achieved using a ternary (conditional) operator in two levels. In the first level, it checks if I2C_BUS_MODE is set to low, if so, 'i2c_sclk' is driven by 'clk_400KHz'. If not, it checks the state of the I2C transceiver 's_i2c_transceiver'. If it is in either the byte transfer state or acknowledgment transfer state, 'i2c_sclk' is again set to 'clk_400KHz', else it is set to low."
