This module handles the timing and signaling logic for I2C transmission, including the generation of start and stop signals, data byte transfer, and the I2C acknowledge process. It also handles special conditions like the idle state and transfer completion. It essentially acts as an I2C transceiver, controlling both data transmission ('master' mode) and reception ('slave' mode) depending on the mode of operation determined by the I2C_BUS_MODE parameter. The module makes use of a finite state machine to control these operations."
