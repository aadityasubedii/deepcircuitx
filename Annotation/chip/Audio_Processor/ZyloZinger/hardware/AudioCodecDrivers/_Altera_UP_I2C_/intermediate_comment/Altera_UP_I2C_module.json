    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_I2C module implements the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol for intra-board communications, acting as a transceiver to handle both data transmission and reception. It uses input signals to control operations like start/stop signals and data transfer, and output signals to provide responses like acknowledgment and transfer completion. The functionality is achieved by a state machine logic, considering various internal signals and states of operations. The module also features input/output control by decoding and synchronizing data based on the operation states."
