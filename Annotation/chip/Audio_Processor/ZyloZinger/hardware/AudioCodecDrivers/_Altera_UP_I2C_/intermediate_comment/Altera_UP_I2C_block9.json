    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the I2C start and stop condition detection for an I2C transceiver. The I2C transceiver shifts into the start condition upon a system reset, set by `i2c_scen` becoming 1 at a rising-edge clock cycle when `reset` is high. When the output bit changes and the transceiver is in the start state (`I2C_STATE_2_START_BIT`), `i2c_scen` is cleared, disabling the start condition. Additionally, it re-enables the start condition when the transceiver is in the stop state (`I2C_STATE_5_STOP_BIT`)."
