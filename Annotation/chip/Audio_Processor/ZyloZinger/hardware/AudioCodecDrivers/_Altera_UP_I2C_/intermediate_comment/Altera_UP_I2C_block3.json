    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code assigns the state of the `i2c_sdata` line in an I2C protocol operation. The state of the `i2c_sdata` line is determined by the current state of the I2C transceiver and whether a byte is being read or written. During start and stop conditions, the data line is forced low. When transferring an acknowledgment bit during a read operation, it is forced low again. However, when transferring a bit from `current_byte` during a write operation, the bit value is used. In all other cases, the data line is set to high impedance."
