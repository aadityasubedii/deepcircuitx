    "block_comment": "This block behaves as an acknowledgment signal controller in an I2C interface. It is triggered at the positive edge of the clock. When a reset or a clear acknowledgment signal is issued, the acknowledgment ('ack') is set to zero. The 'ack' signal is also updated when both start-stop enable ('start_and_stop_en') is high and I2C transceiver is in the 'TRANSFER_ACK' state; in this case, it is set to the XOR result of the I2C data signal and the bus mode."
