This block of code manages the counting of the current bit being transmitted in an I2C operation. The count is reset when a 'reset' signal is asserted under the positive clock edge conditions. If the I2C transceiver is in the state of transferring a byte and 'change_output_bit_en' signal is active, the 'current_bit' counter is decrement by one. If the I2C operation isn't in the byte transferring mode, 'current_bit' is reset to 'num_bits_to_transfer', also under positive-edge clock condition.
