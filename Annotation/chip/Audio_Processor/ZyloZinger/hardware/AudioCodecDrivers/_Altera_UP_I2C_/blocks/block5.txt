Comment: 
The block of code represents a state machine control for an I2C protocol working on synchronous design principles. It initiates a reset condition to clear the `current_byte`, and updates it with the `data_in` when the I2C transceiver is idle or found transmitting a start bit. This block uses conditional constructs to handle these operations, resetting when the `reset` signal is high, and loading the `current_byte` register with new data under specified conditions by facilitating data transactions on different states of the I2C interface.
