This block of code implements an I2C transceiver state-machine control function, using Verilog. When a reset signal is detected, the state of the transceiver is reset to its idle state, designated as I2C_STATE_0_IDLE. In scenarios where it doesn't receive a reset signal, the transceiver's state increments or remains same depending on the logic implemented in states of 'ns_i2c_transceiver'. This happens on the rising edge of every clock cycle to ensure synchronization in hardware.
