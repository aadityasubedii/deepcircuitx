Comment: 
This block enables the clock signal in an I2C transceiver unless the transceiver state is idle or complete. It does so using logical bitwise negations and AND operations to check the current state of the I2C transceiver, switching on the clock signal unless the transceiver is at its initial idle state (I2C_STATE_0_IDLE) or final complete state (I2C_STATE_6_COMPLETE).
