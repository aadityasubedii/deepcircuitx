Module name: Altera_UP_I2C.

Module specification: The Altera_UP_I2C module is primarily designed to handle both transmitting and receiving operations utilizing the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol. It manages the timing and signalling logic essential for I2C transmission, which includes start/stop signal generation, data byte transfer, the I2C acknowledgment process, and other special conditions. 

The module employs a variety of input ports such as clk, reset, clear_ack, clk_400KHz, start_and_stop_en, change_output_bit_en, send_start_bit, send_stop_bit, data_in, transfer_data, read_byte, num_bits_to_transfer. These inputs govern the operation control such as system's clock signal, state resetting, changing output bit, start bit control, data transfer, and so on. Output ports include i2c_sclk, i2c_scen, ack, data_from_i2c, transfer_complete that control the signals for the clock, data received from the I2C bus, transfers, and so on. There is also an inout port, i2c_sdata, for sending and receiving data over the I2C bus.

The internal signals that exist within this module such as I2C_BUS_MODE, I2C_STATE_0_IDLE to I2C_STATE_6_COMPLETE, current_bit, current_byte, ns_i2c_transceiver, and s_i2c_transceiver form the backbone of the logic and state transitions in the interfacing with the I2C bus. 

The module operates with a state machine logic to control these operations which are broken down into sections such as state initialization, next state decoding, scenario handling by the state machine, synchronizing output, input decoding, and assigning values based on current states and operating conditions. Each of these procedure blocks contributes to ensuring successful data transmission and aiding communication over the I2C bus protocol.
