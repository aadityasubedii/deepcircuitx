    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a bit counter in a digital system. It is synchronous with a clock signal, with its functionality largely determined by conditions on reset signals and a bit_clk_falling_edge signal. Upon a positive clock edge, if a reset is high, the bit counter is set to a default value of 0. If the reset bit counter is high, the bit counter is initialized with a predefined value BIT_COUNTER_INIT. If none of these conditions are true, and with a falling edge on bit_clk signal, and if the bit counter is not already at 0, it's decremented by 1."
