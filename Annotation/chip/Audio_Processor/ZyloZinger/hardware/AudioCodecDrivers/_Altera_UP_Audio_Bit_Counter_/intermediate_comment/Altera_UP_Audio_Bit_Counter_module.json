    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter, serves to count bits in digital audio systems. It's driven by a main clock (`clk`) and resets either when `reset` signal is active or on both edges of `left_right_clk`. The count decreases on `bit_clk_falling_edge` if not already zero. `bit_counter` (5-bit register) holds the count, while `reset_bit_counter` governs the resets. The `counting` output indicates an ongoing count process. The implementation achieves this via multiple always blocks for `bit_counter` and `counting` operations under specified clock and reset conditions."
