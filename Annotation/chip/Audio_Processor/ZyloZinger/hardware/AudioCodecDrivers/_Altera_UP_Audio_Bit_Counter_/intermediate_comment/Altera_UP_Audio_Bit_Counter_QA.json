It operates with every clock signal, and on reset, the bit counter is zeroed. If `reset_bit_counter` is activated, it sets the bit counter to its initial value specified by `BIT_COUNTER_INIT`. The counter decreases with each `bit_clk_falling_edge` if the counter is not already zeroed. The `counting` output signal is activated when the `reset_bit_counter` is triggered and deactivated once the bit counter reaches zero. The `reset_bit_counter` is triggered on both rising and falling edges of the `left_right_clk`."
