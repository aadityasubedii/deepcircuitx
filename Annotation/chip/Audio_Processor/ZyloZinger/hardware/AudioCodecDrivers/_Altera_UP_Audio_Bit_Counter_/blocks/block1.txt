The block of code is primarily used for resetting the bit counter. This is achieved by assigning the logical OR of two signals: `left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge`. These signals are assumed to depict rising and falling edges of a clock signal respectively. So, the counter is reset either when the clock has a rising edge or a falling edge.
