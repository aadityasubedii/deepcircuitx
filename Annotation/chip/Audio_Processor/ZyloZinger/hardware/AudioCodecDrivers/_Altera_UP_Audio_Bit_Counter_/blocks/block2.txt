This block of code implements an edge-triggered counter. Upon receiving a positive edge clock signal, the block checks the reset signal: if reset is high, the counting operation is stopped, setting 'counting' to zero. If the 'reset_bit_counter' signal is high, the 'counting' process is enabled, setting 'counting' to one. There's also a condition to stop the 'counting' when a falling edge of 'bit_clk' occurs and the 'bit_counter' is zero. Thus, this block maintains the 'counting' signal based on these conditions.
