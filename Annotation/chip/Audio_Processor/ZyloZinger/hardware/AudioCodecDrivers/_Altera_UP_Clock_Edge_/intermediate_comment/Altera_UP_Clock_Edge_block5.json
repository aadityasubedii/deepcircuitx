    "block_comment": "This block is in charge of synchronizing the `cur_test_clk` signal with the main clock, `clk`. It plays a role in a clock domain crossing scenario by taking the `test_clk` signal and updating `cur_test_clk` with its value every time a rising edge of `clk` occurs. This is a simple flip-flop based synchronization method implemented in Verilog."
