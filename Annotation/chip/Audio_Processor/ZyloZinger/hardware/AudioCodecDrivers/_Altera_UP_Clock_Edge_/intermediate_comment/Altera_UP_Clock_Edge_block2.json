    "block_comment": "The block of code detects the falling edge of an input signal. The detection is achieved by logically ANDing the 'found_edge' and 'last_test_clk' signals, where 'found_edge' typically represents the detection of a transition (either rising or falling) and 'last_test_clk' reflects the previous state of the clock signal. This detection method relies on the fact that a falling edge is represented by a transition from a high ('1') to low ('0') state."
