    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for detecting a rising edge in a test clock signal. It uses a bitwise AND operation to perform this function. Specifically, it checks if both an edge ('found_edge') is detected and if the current clock signal ('cur_test_clk') is high. If both conditions are true, it assigns '1' to the 'rising_edge', indicating a rising edge has been detected on the test clock signal."
