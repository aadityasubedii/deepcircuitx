    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a rising and falling edge detection mechanism. Triggered at the positive edge of the clock signal, it first updates the last_test_clk signal with the current test_clk value. It then identifies whether a rising or falling edge has occurred in the test clock by using bitwise AND and XOR operations. Rising edges are determined when both found_edge and cur_test_clk are true, and falling edges are determined when both found_edge and last_test_clk are true. Found edges are calculated by comparing the last and current test clock signals using a XOR operation."
