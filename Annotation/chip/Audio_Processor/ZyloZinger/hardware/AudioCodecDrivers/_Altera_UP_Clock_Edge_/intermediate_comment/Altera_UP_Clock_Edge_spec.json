    "spec": "Module name: Altera_UP_Clock_Edge. \n\nModule specification: The Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module is an edge detection unit, specifically designed to detect and differentiate rising and falling edges in the input signal 'test_clk' with respect to the input clock signal 'clk'. The module takes three inputs namely 'clk', 'reset', and 'test_clk'. The 'clk' is the system clock used to synchronize time-dependent changes occurring within the unit. The 'reset' signal input while declared is not utilized in the module. The 'test_clk' signal is the input whose edges are sought after. The module features two output ports - 'rising_edge', which goes HIGH when a rising edge in the 'test_clk' signal is detected and 'falling_edge' turning HIGH on detection of a falling edge in 'test_clk'. Internal to the module, three signals are defined - 'found_edge', 'cur_test_clk', and 'last_test_clk'. They aid in edge detection by keeping track of changes and transitions in 'test_clk'. 'found_edge' uses XOR operation between 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk' to detect any change or transition in the 'test_clk' signal. The 'cur_test_clk' registers the current state of 'test_clk', and the 'last_test_clk' records the 'cur_test_clk' of the previous clock cycle. These states are updated at every positive edge of the 'clk'. The rising and falling edges are detected by logical AND operations of 'found_edge' with 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk' respectively. The module is organized into multiple sections to assign values to internal signals, update these values at certain instances, and finally to compute the output. Each step aids in achieving the module's ultimate goal of rising and falling edge detection of 'test_clk' signal.",
