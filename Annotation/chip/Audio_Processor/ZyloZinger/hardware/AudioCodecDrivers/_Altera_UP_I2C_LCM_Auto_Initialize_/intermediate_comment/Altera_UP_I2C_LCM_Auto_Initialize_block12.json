    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a finite state machine (FSM) handling an I2C communications protocol. It controls how bytes are sent over an I2C bus by automating the process, controlling various states from initialization to completion. Starting at the status check, the machine transitions to INIT state if the previous operation hasn't finished, and to DONE state if it has. Depending on conditions like transfer completion and state change signals, the machine goes through sending start bit, transferring bytes, waiting, sending stop bit, and increasing counter stages, cyclically returning to the status check post counter incrementation. If it's at an unknown state, it defaults back to status check."
