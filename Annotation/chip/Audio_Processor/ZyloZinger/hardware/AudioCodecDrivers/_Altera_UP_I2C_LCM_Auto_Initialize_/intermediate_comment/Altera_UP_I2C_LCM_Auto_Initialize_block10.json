    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily focused on updating the variable `data_size` under different conditions. On every positive edge of the clock (`clk`), it first checks if `reset` is 1, in which case it sets `data_size` to 0. If `reset` is not 1 and `s_i2c_auto_init` is in `AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT` state, it sets `data_size` to 6. If `s_i2c_auto_init` is in `AUTO_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE_1` state instead, it sets `data_size` to 7. This implies an operational role of managing data size based on control signals and device's state."
