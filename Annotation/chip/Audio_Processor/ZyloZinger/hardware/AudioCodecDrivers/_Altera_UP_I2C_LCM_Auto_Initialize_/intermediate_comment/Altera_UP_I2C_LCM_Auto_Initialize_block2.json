    "block_comment": "This block defines a condition to signal the end of automatic initialization of ROM. In this context, `finished_auto_init` serves as a flag which is raised high (1) when the `rom_address_counter` reaches its maximum possible value indicated by `MAX_ROM_ADDRESS`. This effectively means that the system has finished automatically initializing or addressing all addresses of the ROM up to its maximum limit."
