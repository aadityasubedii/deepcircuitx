    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the ROM address counter. Upon the positive edge (rising edge) of the clock signal, it checks if a reset signal is active. If active, the ROM address counter is reset to the minimum ROM address. If not, it checks for the state of an I2C auto initialisation sequence. If the I2C auto initialisation sequence is in the phase to increase the counter ('AUTO_STATE_6_INCREASE_COUNTER'), the ROM address counter is incremented."
