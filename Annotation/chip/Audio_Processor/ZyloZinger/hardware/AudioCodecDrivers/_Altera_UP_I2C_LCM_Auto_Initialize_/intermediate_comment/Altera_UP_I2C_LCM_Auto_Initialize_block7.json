    "block_comment": "This block manages the `send_stop_bit` state based on system conditions. At each positive edge of the clock, it checks for a system reset or transfer completion status \u2013 in these cases, it clears the `send_stop_bit`. If the state of `s_i2c_auto_init` equals `AUTO_STATE_5_SEND_STOP_BIT`, it sets the `send_stop_bit` to HIGH, which likely triggers the transmission of a stop bit in an I2C communication system."
