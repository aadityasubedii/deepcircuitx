    "module": "Module-level comment: This Altera_UP_I2C_LCM_Auto_Initialize module initializes a Liquid Crystal Module (LCM) via an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) interface. It uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage the initialization sequence, keeping track of states using s_i2c_auto_init and ns_i2c_auto_init. Data for initialization is stored & managed via rom_data & rom_address_counter. The module monitors completion and errors via transfer_complete, ack and auto_init_error signals. I2C cycles are managed using send_start_bit and send_stop_bit signals. This module is driven by a clock input and can be reset via the reset signal."
