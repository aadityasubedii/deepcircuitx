    "block_comment": "This block of code is for signal assignment in a state machine. The signal `change_state` is assigned the result of a logical AND operation between `transfer_complete` and `transfer_data`. Practically, the state of the system would change only when the data transfer is complete and transfer data signal is high. This block represents this decision point in the state machine implementation."
