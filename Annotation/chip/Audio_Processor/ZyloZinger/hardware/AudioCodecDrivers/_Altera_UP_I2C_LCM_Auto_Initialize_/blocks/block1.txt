This Verilog block is responsible for defining the behaviour of a read-only memory (ROM) module. The functionality of the block is determined by the value of the 'rom_address_counter', which serves as an index to select specific data from the ROM module. The selected data is then assigned to 'rom_data'. If the 'rom_address_counter' index isn't within the given range (0 to 19), then a default value of 0 is assigned to 'rom_data'. Implementation-wise, a case statement is employed to map each value of the 'rom_address_counter' to its corresponding data in the ROM module.
