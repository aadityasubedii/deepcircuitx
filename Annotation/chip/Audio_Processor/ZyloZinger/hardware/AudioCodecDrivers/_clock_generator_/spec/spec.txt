Module name: clock_generator. 

Module specification: The 'clock_generator' module is a specialized hardware design written in Verilog RTL code, whose main function is the generation of a clock signal named 'AUD_XCK', dedicated for audio applications. It operates based on an input clock signal 'CLOCK_27' and a reset signal. Internally, the module deploys the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) megafunction that Altera provides, which is named 'DE_Clock_Generator_Audio'. The output clock frequency is adjustable through the 'AUD_CLK_MULT' and 'AUD_CLK_DIV' parameters. The PLL produces a 'locked' output, which the module relays to an external circuit by means of an internal wire named 'audio_clk_locked'. This provides an indication of the moment when the PLL locks onto the input frequency and therefore, validation of the stability of the output clock signal. Furthermore, the module has provisions for a multitude of port connections that are associated with the PLL, but only a few of these are active and their behavior is determined within the 'clock_generator' module. The hierarchy and interplay between the components result in the generation of a clock signal specified for audio applications - which forms the core function of the 'clock_generator' module.
