Module-level comment: The 'clock_generator' module generates an audio-specific clock signal 'AUD_XCK' using an Altera's Phase Locked Loop megafunction (named 'DE_Clock_Generator_Audio') that operates based on an input clock 'CLOCK_27' and a reset signal. The output clock 'AUD_XCK' frequency can be adjusted by tuning 'AUD_CLK_MULT' and 'AUD_CLK_DIV' parameters. The 'audio_clk_locked' signal, connected to the PLL 'locked' output, indicates successful lock and stability of the output clock signal. Various other PLL-related ports exist but most are unused in this context.
