It takes an input clock (CLOCK_27) and a reset signal. The module uses an Altera's Phase Locked Loop (PLL) megafunction (altpll) named DE_Clock_Generator_Audio to generate this output. This output clock's frequency is determined by the AUD_CLK_MULT and AUD_CLK_DIV parameters. The generator has an output called audio_clk_locked which indicates when the PLL has locked onto the input clock signal. A number of port connections for the PLL are left unused, and the active ones are set directly inside the module."

This internal wire is then connected to the 'locked' output port of the Altera's Phase Locked Loop (PLL) megafunction (altpll - DE_Clock_Generator_Audio).
