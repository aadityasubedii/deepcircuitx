As per your request, I am supposed to generate a detailed specification for the module. However, the original Verilog RTL code you provided is incomplete. It merely includes the declaration of a package called `'msdap_components'` and an incomplete `include` statement with the filename missing.

For a detailed specification including the name of the module, its functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, and different blocks, a complete, valid Verilog RTL code is required. With the currently provided snippet, it's not possible to generate a detailed specification as the data is insufficient.

Kindly provide a complete Verilog RTL code and I'd be more than happy to help you generate a detailed specification for the module.
