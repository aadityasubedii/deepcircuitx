Module Name: shift_accumulator. 

Module Specification: The 'shift_accumulator' module is a Verilog design tasked with selectively shifting, loading and clearing data based on various input control signals. It operates on a 40-bit wide data, which is input through the 'data_in' port. Other inputs include 'shift_enable', 'clear', 'load' and 'Sclk'. 'shift_enable' when set high, enables the shifting of the 'data_in'. 'clear' is to reset the contents in the accumulator. 'load' is high to indicate new data to be processed and 'Sclk' is the clock signal, controlling the operation timeframes. The blocks present in the code check these conditions, perform appropriate actions and maintain a register 'shift_acc_reg' for the current state of the shift accumulator. 'shift_acc_reg' is a 40-bit registered internal signal where input data is stored, cleared or shifted. The output of this module is made available through the 'data_out' port, which is a current snapshot of 'shift_acc_reg'. The aforementioned set of operations are controlled and executed on the positive edge of clock 'Sclk' or a high 'clear'. Verification of 'shift_enable' and 'load' signals direct the module to execute either shift-load or just load operations alongside enabling the clearing operation.
