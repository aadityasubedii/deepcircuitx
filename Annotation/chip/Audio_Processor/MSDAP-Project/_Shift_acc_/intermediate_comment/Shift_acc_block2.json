    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a shift accumulator register for a synchronous system. On each positive edge of the system clock ('Sclk') or when 'clear' signal is active, the block alters the register 'shift_acc_reg'. If 'clear' is activated, it resets the register to 0. In case 'load' and 'shift_enable' are activated, it performs a left circular shift on 'data_in' and loads the shifted value into 'shift_acc_reg'. If 'load' is activated but 'shift_enable' is not, it simply loads 'data_in' into the register."
