    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'shift_accumulator' module performs shift-load or load operations on a 40-bit 'data_in' based on 'shift_enable' and 'load' signals, and resets the data when 'clear' is set high. The operation occurs at the positive edge of 'Sclk' or a clear signal. A register 'shift_acc_reg' captures the live state of the shift accumulator, which is output through 'data_out'."
