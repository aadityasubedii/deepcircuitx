    "spec": "Module Name: shift_accumulator. \n\nModule Specification: The 'shift_accumulator' module is a Verilog design tasked with selectively shifting, loading and clearing data based on various input control signals. It operates on a 40-bit wide data, which is input through the 'data_in' port. Other inputs include 'shift_enable', 'clear', 'load' and 'Sclk'. 'shift_enable' when set high, enables the shifting of the 'data_in'. 'clear' is to reset the contents in the accumulator. 'load' is high to indicate new data to be processed and 'Sclk' is the clock signal, controlling the operation timeframes. The blocks present in the code check these conditions, perform appropriate actions and maintain a register 'shift_acc_reg' for the current state of the shift accumulator. 'shift_acc_reg' is a 40-bit registered internal signal where input data is stored, cleared or shifted. The output of this module is made available through the 'data_out' port, which is a current snapshot of 'shift_acc_reg'. The aforementioned set of operations are controlled and executed on the positive edge of clock 'Sclk' or a high 'clear'. Verification of 'shift_enable' and 'load' signals direct the module to execute either shift-load or just load operations alongside enabling the clearing operation.",

It acts as a shift accumulator. Its value can be updated or cleared based on multiple control conditions. For example, If the 'clear' signal is enabled, the shift accumulator register, shift_acc_reg, is cleared and set to 0. If the 'load' and 'shift_enable' signals are active, the incoming data, data_in, is shifted and gets stored in the shift_acc_reg register. If just the 'load' is active, the incoming data, data_in, simply gets stored into the shift_acc_reg register without any shift. At every positive edge of the Sclk, or upon a clear signal, the conditional checks re-evaluate according to the given inputs and reflect on the contents of shift_acc_reg. The status of shift_acc_reg is assigned to data_out, providing a real-time snapshot of the shift accumulator at any point of time."
