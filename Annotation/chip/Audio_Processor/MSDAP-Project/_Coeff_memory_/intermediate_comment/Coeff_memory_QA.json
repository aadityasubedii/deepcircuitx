It has two operational modes: WRITE mode and READ mode. In WRITE mode, it loads a 16-bit input data (`data_in`) to a specific memory address (`coeff_wr_addr`) when `wr_en` signal is high and the clock signal `Sclk` is at negative edge. In READ mode, it outputs the data (`coeff_data`) stored at the specific memory address (`coeff_rd_addr`) when `rd_en` signal is high, otherwise it outputs zero. This memory has 512 slots, each holding 16-bit data."
