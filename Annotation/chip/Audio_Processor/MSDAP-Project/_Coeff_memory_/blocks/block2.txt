Comment: 
This block of code handles the writing process to a coefficient memory block in a digital system. On every falling edge of the system's clock (`Sclk`), this block checks if the write enable (`wr_en`) signal is active. If it's active, the block writes the data (`data_in`) to the coefficient memory (`coeff_mem`) at the specified write address (`coeff_wr_addr`).
