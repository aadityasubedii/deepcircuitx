Comment: 
This block of code handles reading data from "coeff_mem" memory. The decision to perform a memory read operation is signaled by the 'rd_en' flag. Upon activation of 'rd_en', the block retrieves data stored at the memory address specified by 'coeff_rd_addr' and assigns it to 'coeff_data'. If 'rd_en' is not active, no memory read takes place and 'coeff_data' is set to zero.
