Module-level comment: This 'coeff_memory' module serves as a coefficient storage in Verilog, capable of both reading and writing 16-bit data to a 512-slot memory. The module's operations depend upon 'wr_en' and 'rd_en' input signals, executing write and read operations respectively. Memory addressing is controlled by 'coeff_wr_addr' and 'coeff_rd_addr' for write and read respectively, and data input is 'data_in'. The output, 'coeff_data', reflects the read data or zero depending on 'rd_en'. Implementation is divided into two sections - an always block triggered at 'Sclk' negedge for write operations, and a continuous assignment statement for read operations.
