Module-level comment: The SIPO module performs the function of transforming serial input data into parallel output. It operates synchronously with a system clock (Dclk), starting the process with a Frame signal. It monitors two serialized inputs (InputL, InputR), shifting them into 16-bit parallel outputs (data_L, data_R), tracked by a bit_count. On completion, an input_ready signal is asserted. A clear signal can reset the system. A frame_start signal keeps track of an ongoing frame. The code is divided into sections for system clearance, frame initialization, ongoing frame processing, and system reset.
