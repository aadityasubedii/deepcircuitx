Explanation: The module SIPO (Serial In Parallel Out) performs the function of a shift register where the data enters serially and leaves in parallel. The module handles two inputs in parallel (InputL, InputR) and outputs 16-bit registers (data_L, data_R). It waits for a high on the frame (Frame), then starts shifting in the incoming data into data_L and data_R from the most significant bit (15), decrementing the bit count and putting the bits into the respective data units. When the bit count reaches 0, it sets the input_ready signal high to indicate that data is ready and a new frame can be served. If clear is set high, it clears data, resets bit count, and makes the unit ready for new data. It operates synchronously with the input clock (Dclk)."

Explanation: This is a control signal which, when activated (set high), resets the system, i.e., it clears the data and makes the SIPO module ready for a new frame.\n4. InputL and InputR. Explanation: InputL and InputR are the serial inputs, which will be converted into parallel outputs.

Explanation: These two 16-bit registries store the incoming data from InputL and InputR respectively and express them in parallel. They shift in inputs and compose the 16 bits, which are available only when the input_ready signal is high (indicating completion of the frame).\n2. input_ready.
