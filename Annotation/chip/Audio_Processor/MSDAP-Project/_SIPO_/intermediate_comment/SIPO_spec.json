    "spec": "Module name: SIPO. \n\nModule specification: The Serial In Parallel Out (SIPO) module is a shift register designed to handle serialized input data, shift it and present it as parallel output. This module operates synchronously with the input system clock (Dclk), and accepts two serial input data (InputL, InputR). The processing of data begins when the Frame signal starts (is set high), causing the data to start shifting into 16-bit register outputs (data_L, data_R) from the most significant bit downwards. This process is tracked using an internal 4-bit register bit_count, which begins from a count of 15 and decrements as each bit gets processed. When this count reaches 0, the input_ready signal is set high, indicating the completion of a frame and readiness for a new one. A control signal clear, when set high, resets the system by clearing the data, making the module ready for another frame. Internally, a flag named frame_start is used to track if the frame processing is ongoing. It is enabled as the Frame signal is activated and remains so until the entire frame has been processed. The code structure is essentially divided into sections for system clearance, initialization per frame, ongoing frame processing, and system reset. These collectively enable the effective transformation of the serial input into parallel output, handled with clock synchronization, in the SIPO module.",

Explanation: The module SIPO (Serial In Parallel Out) performs the function of a shift register where the data enters serially and leaves in parallel. The module handles two inputs in parallel (InputL, InputR) and outputs 16-bit registers (data_L, data_R). It waits for a high on the frame (Frame), then starts shifting in the incoming data into data_L and data_R from the most significant bit (15), decrementing the bit count and putting the bits into the respective data units. When the bit count reaches 0, it sets the input_ready signal high to indicate that data is ready and a new frame can be served. If clear is set high, it clears data, resets bit count, and makes the unit ready for new data. It operates synchronously with the input clock (Dclk)."

They shift in inputs and compose the 16 bits, which are available only when the input_ready signal is high (indicating completion of the frame).\n2. input_ready.
