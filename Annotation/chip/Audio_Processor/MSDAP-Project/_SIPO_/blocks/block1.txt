Comment: 
This block is a synchronizer for the input data. It gets triggered on the rising edge of a data clock or a clear signal. The block essentially latches input data, frames it, and notifies when the frame is ready. When a clear signal is present, it resets all signals to zero state. If a frame start signal is high, it sequentially stores incoming data into the `data_L` & `data_R` registers and decrements the bit count. Once a full frame is received, it sets `input_ready` to signal the readiness of a frame. If a frame is not in progress, it resets the bit counter and clears the data registers.
