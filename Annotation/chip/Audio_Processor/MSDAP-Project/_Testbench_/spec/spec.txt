Module name: Peer_Test. 

Module specification: The module 'Peer_Test' serves as a testbench, responsible for testing the functionality and output consistency between two versions of a multi-standard digital audio processor (MSDAP) design - RTL and behavioral versions, signified by the instances uut_rtl and uut_beh. It operates by generating two clocks Dclk and Sclk and stimulating both designs through various inputs like Frame, InputL, and InputR. It then compares the outputs from the two designs, counting and documenting discrepancies and handling system resets when needed. 

The module has several input ports: Dclk, Sclk, Frame, InputL, InputR, Reset_n, and Start; which are used to control system's timing, feed stereo pair of audio inputs, reset the system, and start the processing unit respectively. The output ports OutReady, OutputL, and OutputR on the other hand, convey readiness of the output and left-right output signals that represent the output of the audio processing module.

The module employs various internal signals such as InReady_beh, OutReady_beh, OutputL_beh, OutputR_beh, InReady_rtl, OutReady_rtl, OutputL_rtl, OutputR_rtl, i, j, k, fp, writeL, writeR, reset_flag, data, mismatches for a multitude of tasks. The tasks include managing inputs and outputs of the RTL and behavioral models, coordinating the reset mechanism, storing test input data, and tracking the total number of discrepancies detected. 

The internal structure of the module is split into several sections that focus on initializing and controlling the clocks and input-output signals, managing the test data memory, handling system reset and data read-write, and comparison and logging of the output discrepancies.
