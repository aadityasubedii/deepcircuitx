Module-level comment: The 'Peer_Test' module is a testbench that tests the output consistency between two versions (RTL and behavioral) of a multi-standard digital audio processor (MSDAP) design. The module reads inputs from a .in file, stimulates both designs concurrently, compares the outputs, counts discrepancies, and logs any mismatches into an "output.txt" file. It also manages system resets under specific conditions. The operation is timed using two clocks: Dclk (main clock) and Sclk (controls comparison timing).
