    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a reset and data-fetching function for a digital system, executed on the positive edge of Dclk. If certain pre-defined conditions are met (j equals 9458 or 13058 and reset_flag is low), it resets the system and sets a reset flag. On the other hand, when 'InReady' signal is high or the reset flag has already been set, it increments the indices (j,k) and fetches left and right input data from a 2-dimensional data array. If 'k' reaches -1, it resets 'k' to 15 and increases 'j' by 2, and if the reset flag was set, it resets the flag."
