It stimulates both the rtl and behavioral versions of a same design (MSDAP_top and Top) with a set of inputs and compares the corresponding outputs. Genearlly, it generates two clocks Dclk and Sclk, and inputs using the memory read function with a \".in\" file. These inputs are fed into both designs concurrently. The module then checks the consistency of the outputs of both designs. If they differ, it is logged into an output file \"output.txt\" and a mismatch counter is updated. There is also a reset mechanism involved during the test, which can reset the designs under specific conditions."
