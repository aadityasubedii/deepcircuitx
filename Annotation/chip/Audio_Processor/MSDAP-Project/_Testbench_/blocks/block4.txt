This block of code is used to open a file named "output.txt" for writing and reading. The 'initial' keyword in Verilog specifies that this block is executed once at the start of the simulation. Here, the system task $fopen is called with the filename and the file mode ("w+" - open for reading and writing), respectively, and the file descriptor is stored in the variable "fp". This block is typically used for logging simulation output to a file and is a part of testbench infrastructure.
