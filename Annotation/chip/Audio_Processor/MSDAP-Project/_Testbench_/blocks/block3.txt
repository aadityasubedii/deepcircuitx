This block of code initializes system variables and reads an input data file. At the start of the operation, system clock signals (Dclk and Sclk), the Frame, inputs (InputL and InputR), Reset_n signal are set to 1 or 0 as appropriate. It also initializes the 'mismatches' variable to zero. The system then loads a hexadecimal data array from the "data1.in" file and displays a message indicating successful data read operation. The Start signal is then pulsed High for a short duration of 2 time units.
