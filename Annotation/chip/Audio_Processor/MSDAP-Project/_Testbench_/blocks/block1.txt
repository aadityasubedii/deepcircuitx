This block of code implements a system clock edge-triggered routine that checks the output readiness and performs XOR operations between RTL and behavioral level outputs on both left and right channels. If the output is ready, the XOR results are stored in 'writeL' and 'writeR' arrays, and the overall output is also updated with these XOR results. 'i' pointer is decremented and when it hits below zero, a formatted monitor outputs the array values into a file. The pointer is then reset to 39 and a check is performed to see if 'writeL' and 'writeR' are both zero - if not, the mismatch count is incremented.
