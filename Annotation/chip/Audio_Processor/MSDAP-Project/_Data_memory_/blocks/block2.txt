Comment: 
This block of code increments a counter `zero_cnt` every time `data_in` registers zero at the positive edge of `input_rdy_flag`. If `data_in` contains any non-zero data, the counter `zero_cnt` resets to zero and `zero_flag` also gets reset. However, if `zero_cnt` reaches or exceeds a specific threshold of 800, then `zero_flag` gets set to active high and `zero_cnt` stays pegged at 800. The block essentially monitors `data_in` for a consistent zero input for a specified count length, and sets a flag when this condition is met.
