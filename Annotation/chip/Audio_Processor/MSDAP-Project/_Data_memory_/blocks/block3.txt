Comment: 
This Verilog block functions as a synchronous memory write operation. When the negative edge of the clock signal Sclk is detected, it checks the write enable signal 'wr_en'. If 'wr_en' is high, the data in 'data_in' is written into the 'data_mem' memory block at the address specified by 'data_wr_addr'. If 'wr_en' is not high, the data at the 'data_wr_addr' in 'data_mem' remains unchanged.
