It mimics the functionality of data memory. This memory can write or read data based on the active clock edge.\nThere are two main parts to this. \n\nFirstly, there is a memory writing mechanism. At every falling edge of the system clock (Sclk), if the write enable (wr_en) signal is high, the 16-bit data input (data_in) is written into the memory address specified by data_wr_addr. If the write enable signal is low, no write operation is performed.\n\nThen there is a mechanism for counting zeros. At every positive edge of the `input_rdy_flag` input, it checks if the value of `data_in` is zero. If it is, it increments the `zero_cnt` and also checks if `zero_cnt` has reached the 800 counts. If it reaches 800 or more, it sets the `zero_flag` high which signals that 800 zeros have been input. If `data_in` is not zero in the successive positive edge of `input_rdy_flag`, both `zero_cnt` and `zero_flag` are reset.\n\nIn addition, based on the read enable (`rd_en`), it will assign the requested data from memory to the output (`xin_data`), or zero if `rd_en` is low."
