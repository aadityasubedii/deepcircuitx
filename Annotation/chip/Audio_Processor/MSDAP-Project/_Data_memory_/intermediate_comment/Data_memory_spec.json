    "spec": "Module name: data_memory.\n\nModule specification: The `data_memory` module is a Verilog module whose primary function is to mimic the functionality of a data memory system. There are two main components to this module, a memory writing mechanism and a mechanism to count zeros in the input. The first component utilizes the system clock signal `Sclk` to write a 16-bit input data `data_in` into a specified memory address `data_wr_addr` at every negative edge, provided the write enable signal `wr_en` is high. The second component counts the number of times a zero input is received on `data_in` at every positive edge of the signal `input_rdy_flag`, up to a maximum of 800, at which point it raises the output signal `zero_flag`. \n\nThe module has several input and output ports. `wr_en` and `rd_en` are the write and read enable signals. `Sclk` is the system clock. `data_wr_addr` and `data_rd_addr` are the write and read addresses for memory. `data_in` is a 16-bit input data, and `xin_data` is a 16-bit data output. The `zero_flag` output signal is raised when 800 zeros have been input. Lastly, `input_rdy_flag` is used to control the zero counting mechanism.\n\nInternally, the module uses two signals: `data_mem` and `zero_cnt`. `data_mem` is a 256-entry memory register array for storing and retrieving data, and `zero_cnt` is a 12-bit counter for zero counting.\n\nThe original code is divided into three main blocks. The first `always` block listens for negative edge of `Sclk` and controls the memory writing operation. The second `always`` block listens for the positive edge of `input_rdy_flag` and operates the zero counter. And finally, the `assign` statement decides on the output of the memory reading operation.",

It mimics the functionality of data memory. This memory can write or read data based on the active clock edge.\nThere are two main parts to this. \n\nFirstly, there is a memory writing mechanism. At every falling edge of the system clock (Sclk), if the write enable (wr_en) signal is high, the 16-bit data input (data_in) is written into the memory address specified by data_wr_addr. If the write enable signal is low, no write operation is performed.\n\nThen there is a mechanism for counting zeros. At every positive edge of the `input_rdy_flag` input, it checks if the value of `data_in` is zero. If it is, it increments the `zero_cnt` and also checks if `zero_cnt` has reached the 800 counts. If it reaches 800 or more, it sets the `zero_flag` high which signals that 800 zeros have been input. If `data_in` is not zero in the successive positive edge of `input_rdy_flag`, both `zero_cnt` and `zero_flag` are reset.\n\nIn addition, based on the read enable (`rd_en`), it will assign the requested data from memory to the output (`xin_data`), or zero if `rd_en` is low."
