Module-level comment: The `data_memory` module is a memory system designed in Verilog. It writes 16-bit `data_in` to a specified address `data_wr_addr` on high `wr_en` at negative `Sclk` edge, and outputs `data_mem` array's content at `data_rd_addr` or zero depending on `rd_en` status. The module also counts zero inputs on `data_in` at positive `input_rdy_flag` edges up to a maximum 800, and raises `zero_flag` when 800 zeros have occurred. Internally, `data_mem` and `zero_cnt` are used for data storage and zero count respectively.
