When \"adder_en\" (adder enable) is true, if \"add_sub\" is set to '1', the subtraction operation will be done (b - a), else if \"add_sub\" is '0', addition operation will be performed (b + a). Any changes in output will be made at the positive edge of the Sclk (System clock). If the \"adder_en\" is not set, it will hold the previous value in the \"temp\" register. The output of this operation is output to the \"sum\" port."

Explanation: These are two 40-bit wide data input ports. Depending on the control signals, an arithmetic operation (either addition or subtraction) is performed between them.\n3. add_sub.
