    "block_comment": "With this block of code, the primary function is to assign the value of the variable \"temp\" to the variable \"sum\". This is implemented using the \"assign\" keyword in Verilog which is used for continuous assignment. Its operation meaning that the value of \"sum\" changes every time \"temp\" changes. It reflects a combinational logic design, providing the capability to define the net or wire values inside the module."
