    "spec": "Module name: adder. \n\nModule specification: The \"adder\" module is a hardware design focused on performing either addition or subtraction operations based on the control signals. It takes in 40-bit wide data inputs 'a' and 'b' and outputs the result to a 40-bit wide 'sum' port. The operation to be performed on these inputs is controlled by \"add_sub\" control signal. If \"add_sub\" is '1', it performs subtraction operation (b - a), if '0', addition operation (a + b) is performed. Additionally, the control signal \"adder_en\" acts as an enabler, allowing the arithmetic operations only when it is set.\n\nThe module includes input ports - 'Sclk' the system clock, the data inputs 'a' and 'b', and the control signals 'add_sub' and 'adder_en'. It has one output port - 'sum', where the result of operation is assigned. Internally, there is a register 'temp' where the result of operation is stored before being assigned to 'sum'.\n\nThe module code is divided into two main blocks - a sequential block triggered at the positive edge of the system clock signal 'Sclk', and a continuous assignment block. If 'adder_en' is '1', the sequential block checks the 'add_sub' signal and accordingly performs either the addition or subtraction of inputs 'a' and 'b', storing the result in 'temp' register. If 'adder_en' is '0', it preserves the previous value in the 'temp' register. The continuous assignment block simply assigns the computed value from 'temp' register to the output 'sum'. The module's functionality is encapsulated in this fashion and is completely synchronous to the system clock signal 'Sclk'.",
