Comment: 
This block performs a conditional addition or subtraction operation based on the `add_sub` signal. Upon every positive cycle of `Sclk`, the block checks if the `adder_en` signal is active. If it's on, it chooses the operation based on the `add_sub` signal: if this signal is '1', an subtraction operation (`b` minus `a`) is conducted; otherwise, an addition operation (`b` plus `a`) is carried out. When `adder_en` is not active, `temp` keeps its current value.
