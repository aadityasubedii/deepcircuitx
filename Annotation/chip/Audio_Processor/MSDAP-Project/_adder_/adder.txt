Module-level comment: The 'adder' module performs either addition or subtraction on two 40-bit inputs 'a' and 'b' based on the control signals 'add_sub' and 'adder_en'. It uses a 40-bit register 'temp' to hold the intermediate result. On the positive edge of 'Sclk', if 'adder_en' is '1', 'temp' is updated with 'b+a' or 'b-a' based on 'add_sub'. If 'adder_en' is '0', the 'temp' register retains its value. The computed 'temp' value is continuously assigned to the output 'sum'.
