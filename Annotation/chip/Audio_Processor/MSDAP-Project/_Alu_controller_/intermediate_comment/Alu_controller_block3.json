    "block_comment": "The block of code handles the resetting and updating of the present state in a state machine. In Verilog language, if the Clear signal is set high ('1'), then the present state flips back to the initial state, effectively resetting the state machine. On the other hand, if Clear is not set ('0'), then the present state takes on the value of the next state, which moves the state machine to the next state as determined by the system logic."
