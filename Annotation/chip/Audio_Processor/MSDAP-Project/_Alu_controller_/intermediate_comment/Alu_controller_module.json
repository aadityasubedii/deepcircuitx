    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'alu_controller' module governs the operations of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). Functioning through a state machine paradigm, it accommodates inputs for data processing and system states, outputs the results, and influences the ALU via control signals. Advanced state control, memory overflow management, and input/output operations are achieved through carefully designated registers and conditional statements. Also, it features several functionalities: arithmetic operations, shifting, data loading, and state transition management including sleeping and clearing of operations. The design ensures high-precision arithmetic computation with tight control on state transitions."
