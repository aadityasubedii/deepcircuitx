    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the state update logic for a state machine. It operates on a positive edge of the clock cycle. The presence of a 'Clear' signal triggers a reset to the initial state of the logic, while the absence of a 'Clear' signal transitions the current state to 'next_state_L'. The current state 'pr_state_L' acquires the value of 'next_state_L' or resets to 'initial_state' based on the condition evaluated."
