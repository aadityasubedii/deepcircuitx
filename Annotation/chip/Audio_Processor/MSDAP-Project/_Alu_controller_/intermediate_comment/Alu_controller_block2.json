    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a finite state machine with three states: initial_state, comp_state, and sleep_state. The code captures transitions between these states and implements various functionalities within each state. It starts from initial_state, where it resets certain signal values, and transitions to comp_state if computation is enabled. In comp_state, it maintains or increments a count (nL_R) and sets a memory overflow flag when the count exceeds a limit. The computation status is also updated based on conditions. If a sleep flag is triggered, the machine moves to sleep_state where most signals are halted except when sleep is deactivated, which transitions back to the computational state. Clear command will reset the FSM to its initial state."
