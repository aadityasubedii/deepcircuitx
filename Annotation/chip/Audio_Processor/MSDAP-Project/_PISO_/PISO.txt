Module-level comment: This is a 'Parallel-In-Serial-Out' (PISO) shift register module. It converts 40-bit parallel input data into a serial output. Operation begins on a positive clock edge after p2s_enable is set. It utilizes a 40-bit temporary storage (temp) for input data and a 4-bit counter (bit_count) for index tracking. The 'output_ready' signal indicates successful completion of conversion. The clear signal resets the outputs. If not in conversion, it maintains a default state of zero output.
