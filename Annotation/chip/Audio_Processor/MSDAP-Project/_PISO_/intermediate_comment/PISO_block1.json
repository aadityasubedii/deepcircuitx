    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block is a digital communication transmitter circuit, performing serial data transmission. The block is activated by a positive clock edge or a clear signal, and it operates in a series of conditional events. If the clear signal is high, the output readiness state is reset. If signal `p2s_enable` is high, a new data frame is loaded. The module then initiates transmission, bit by bit, of a 16-bit data frame where the initial start of a frame is designated by the signal `frame_start`. Once the data frame is entirely transmitted, or in an idle state, the block resets the output readiness state and restarts the process."
