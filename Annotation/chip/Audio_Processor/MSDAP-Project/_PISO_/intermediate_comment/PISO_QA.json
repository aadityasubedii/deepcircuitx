Explanation: The given module is a parallel-in-serial-out (PISO) shift register which takes in parallel data from the input, then outputs it serially. The functionality is controlled by various signals: 'clear' sets the output to an undetermined state 'x' and makes the output not ready. 'p2s_enable' latches the input data and gets the module ready to output. After that, the serial output starts, outputting one bit at a time starting from the 15th bit down to the 0th bit. When all bits have been output, 'output_ready' is set to 1. If no enabling signal is received, the module is reset to its default state and keeps outputting zeros until it's enabled again."

Its positive edge triggers the main logic of the module.\n- clear: This is a clear signal input. When set to 1, it clears the output and output_ready signals.\n- p2s_enable: This is the \"parallel to serial enable\" signal.

One bit at a time is set on this port starting from the 15'th bit of the parallel input. When the module is not actively converting or outputting, this is set to 0.\n- output_ready: This signal indicates the completion status of the serial output data.
