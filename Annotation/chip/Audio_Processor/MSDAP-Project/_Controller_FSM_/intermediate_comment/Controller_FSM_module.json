    "module": "Module-level comment: The main_controller module is a state machine designed to manage control flow in a digital system. It coordinates data input/output, synchronization, and computational operations using various internal signals and states. Important inputs include clocks, start/reset flags, and data readiness indicators, while outputs comprise of address lines, enable signals, and output readiness. The module transitions between pre-defined states like Startup, Wait_rj, Read_rj, Wait_coeff, Read_coeff, Wait_input, Compute, Reset, and Sleep, dictated by clock signals and specific conditions. The movement through these states orchestrates multiple operations like data read/write, signal enabling, and computation initiation."
