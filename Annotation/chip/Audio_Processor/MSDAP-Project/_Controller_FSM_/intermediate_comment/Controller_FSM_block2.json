    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a synchronous reset mechanism and controls the transition of state machine states. When there's a falling edge detected on the system clock (Sclk) or the reset line (Reset_n), the block checks for a low signal on Reset_n, if it's low it implies reset is active and it checks the current state in pr_state. If the state is beyond \"Read_coeff\", it resets the state to the initial 'Reset' state otherwise it assigns the next state. If there's no active reset detected, it simply progresses the state machine to the next state."
