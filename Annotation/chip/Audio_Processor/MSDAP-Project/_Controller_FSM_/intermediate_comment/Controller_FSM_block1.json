    "block_comment": "The block models a finite-state machine (FSM) for a digital system. It implements multiple states like Startup, Wait, Read, Compute, Reset and Sleep to control data flow. On Start signal, the system goes into the Startup state. The state Wait_rj awaits the Frame signal. Based on the Frame signal and the input readiness flag, the FSM transitions between Read and Wait states of different stages such as reading rj, coeff, and input. In Compute state, data is enabled and computed based on input readiness and zero flags. If Reset is triggered, the system goes into Reset state clearing all data. The system enters Sleep state when no data processing is required. All these transitions are based on different conditions acting on digital signals and data counts."
