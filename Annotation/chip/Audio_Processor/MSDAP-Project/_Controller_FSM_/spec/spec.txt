Module name: main_controller. 

Module specification: The main_controller is a state machine module, designed to manage control flow, data reading and writing, synchronization, and computation operations in a digital system. It employs multiple state transitions, which are primarily dictated by various clock signals, conditions, and events. The main states include Startup, Wait_rj, Read_rj, Wait_coeff, Read_coeff, Wait_input, Compute, Reset, and Sleep.

The main_controller has several input ports including Sclk (system's clock input), Dclk (data clock input), Start (operation start signal), Reset_n (reset signal), Frame (new frame indicator), input_rdy_flag (indicates if input data is ready), zero_flag_L & zero_flag_R (signals for zero data on left and right channel), and OutReady_L & OutReady_R (indicate if output data is ready on left and right channel). Its outputs include rj_wr_addr, coeff_wr_addr, data_wr_addr (write addresses for RJ, coefficient, and input data), rj_en, coeff_en, data_en (enable signals for writing RJ, coef, and input data), Clear (clear previous states or data), Frame_out, Dclk_out, Sclk_out (outputs for frame, data, and system clocks), OutReady, compute_enable, sleep_flag (signals for output ready, compute operation, and sleep mode), and InReady (indicates if the module is ready for input data).

The main_controller uses several internal signals such as pr_state and next_state (representing the present and next states of the controller), real_count (counter for the real data items processed), rj_count, coeff_count, data_count (counters for the respective read operations), and taken (indicates if current data slot is ready for new data).

The main sections in the code include an assignment block for specific signal assignments, as well as two always blocks, one for handling state transitions and another for managing different operations and transfers within each state. These operations include writing to addresses, controlling enable signals, tracking counts, and transitioning between different states of the controller based on certain conditions and events like resetting, data readiness, computation enablement, sleep mode, etc.
