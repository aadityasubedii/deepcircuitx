Module-level comment: The 'rj_memory' module implements a 16x16 bit memory with read and write operations. It uses 'wr_en' and 'rd_en' signals to control write and read activities, which are synchronized with the falling edge of 'Sclk'. Memory address and data inputs are provided via 'rj_wr_addr', 'rj_rd_addr' and 'data_in', while 'rj_data' is used to output the read data from the addressed memory. Internal 2D array 'rj_mem' serves as the memory storage.
