Module name: rj_memory. 
Module specification: The 'rj_memory' is a Verilog module designed to function as a 16x16 bit memory. It features both read and write functionalities, governed by control signals 'wr_en' for write enable and 'rd_en' for read enable. The module's operation is synchronous with the falling edge of a clock signal 'Sclk'. The memory addresses for data read and write operations are specified by 4-bit signals 'rj_wr_addr' (write address) and 'rj_rd_addr' (read address) respectively. The data to be written or read is represented by a 16-bit signal; 'data_in' for input data and 'rj_data' for output data. Internally, the module uses a two-dimensional register array 'rj_mem' as its central memory, where data input is stored at a specified write address when 'wr_en' is high and 'Sclk' undergoes a negative edge. In the continuous assignment block, 'rj_data' is assigned values from the memory address 'rj_rd_addr', given 'rd_en' is active, or remains at zero if 'rd_en' is not active. This module thus serves as a simple memory unit, carrying out read and write operations under specific control and timing conditions.
