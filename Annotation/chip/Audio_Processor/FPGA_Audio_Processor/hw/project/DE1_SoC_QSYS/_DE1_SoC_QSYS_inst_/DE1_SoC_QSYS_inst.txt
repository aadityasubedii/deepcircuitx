Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS module serves as a top-level hardware interface for various system functionalities. It regulates system/SDRAM clocks, manages data handling, external inputs, and SDRAM operations. The primary role is to anchor the coordinated communication between the system and connected modules though an elaborate set of input/output ports including .clk_clk, .clk_sdram_clk, .data_in_export, .key_external_connection_export, .reset_reset_n and various .sdram_wire_XXX ports. Additional functionality details demand access to the internal module definition, not available currently.
