    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the next state of the \"av_ld_aligning_data\" signal. It uses conditional (ternary) logic to assign its new value: if the current state of \"av_ld_aligning_data\" is true, it negates the \"av_ld_align_one_more_cycle\" signal, hence setting the \"av_ld_aligning_data_nxt\" to the opposite of the \"av_ld_align_one_more_cycle\" state. If the \"av_ld_aligning_data\" is not true, then it performs a bitwise AND operation between the negated \"D_mem32\" and the \"av_ld_getting_data\", hence \"av_ld_aligning_data_nxt\" is true only when \"D_mem32\" is false and \"av_ld_getting_data\" is true."
