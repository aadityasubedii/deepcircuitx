Comment: 
This Verilog RTL code block is responsible for assigning a byte-enable value based on a conditional statement. If the `jtag_ram_access` signal is true, this implies we are making an access through the JTAG interface and therefore all bytes are enabled with the value `4'b1111` which is four 1's in a 4-bit binary representation. If `jtag_ram_access` is false, which implies the access is not through the JTAG interface, the byte-enable value takes the value of `byteenable` signal from other part of the design. Thus, by dynamically selecting the byte enable value, this block helps manage data accesses with support both via the JTAG interface and otherwise.
