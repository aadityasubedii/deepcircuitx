This block is responsible for managing the fill level of a FIFO buffer in a synchronized system. It operates whenever there's a positive edge in the clock cycle or a positive edge reset. If the reset signal is high, it initializes the FIFO fill level to zero. In case of error (drop_on_error), it decreases the FIFO fill level by the packet length, and further decreases by one if the read operation is in progress. If only a write operation occurs, it increments the FIFO fill level. But if only a read operation is performed, it decreases the FIFO fill level.
