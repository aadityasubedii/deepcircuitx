    "block_comment": "This block represents a state machine managing a Memory Controller functionality. The implementation is comma-based where each memory operations such as refresh, read, and write are defined as different states. On receiving a clock signal, it checks the reset condition initially. When 'reset_n' is 0, it initializes variables to their default values. If not under reset, it updates certain control signals and moves into various states depending on 'm_state'. Each state is represented as a 9-bit code, and the state machine transitions between these states depending on various conditions related logic such as 'refresh_request', 'init_done', 'pending', and 'f_empty'. The 'case' structure forms the core of the state machine, wherein it performs specific operations and changes states based on conditions present within each state's handling block. It ensures proper synchronization of reads, writes and refresh actions of the memory controller using the 'm_state', 'm_cmd', and 'm_next' variables in particular."
