    "block_comment": "This block is utilized for synchronous assignment of various system trace control signals. All trace control signals: `record_load_addr`, `record_store_addr`, `record_load_data`, and `record_store_data` are assigned with the values of `td_mode_trc_ctrl` (Trace Mode Control). Specifically, the block uses the `assign` keyword to set the right-hand side's (td_mode_trc_ctrl) value to each respective left-hand side variable whenever a change in `td_mode_trc_ctrl` occurs."
