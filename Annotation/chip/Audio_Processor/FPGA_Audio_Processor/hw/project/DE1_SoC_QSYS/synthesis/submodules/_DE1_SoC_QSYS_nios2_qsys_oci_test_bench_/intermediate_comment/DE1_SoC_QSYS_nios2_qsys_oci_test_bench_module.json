    "module": "Module-level comment: The module \"DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_oci_test_bench\" serves as a test bench intended for SoC validation on a Nios II system, specifically designed for a DE1 SoC development board. It uses four inputs (`dct_buffer`, `dct_count`, `test_ending`, `test_has_ended`) to stimulate the Device Under Test (DUT) in a simulation. The module does not have any outputs and nor does it implement internal logic or signals. It mainly outlines the structural interface for the DUT."
