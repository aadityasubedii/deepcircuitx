    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to assign a fixed boolean low (0) value to the signal D_ctrl_custom_multi. The 'assign' statement in Verilog hardware description Language (HDL) is used for continuous assignment statements which establish a connection between an output net and its input expressions. In this case, D_ctrl_custom_multi is set to 0, meaning it will continuously hold this value."
