    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the variable `edge_capture_wr_strobe`, determining whether a write strobe event on the edge capture will occur or not. The write strobe event is triggered when three conditions are met simultaneously: `chipselect` is asserted (true), `write_n` is not asserted (false), and `address` equals 3."
