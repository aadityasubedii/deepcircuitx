Comment: 
This line of Verilog code assigns a value to the cpu_i_address. Specifically, the cpu_i_address is given the value of F_pc concatenated with '00'. The 'assign' keyword is used for continuous assignment statements in Verilog, meaning that the right-hand-side expression is evaluated and the result is continuously driven onto the left-hand side. `F_pc` is a register value and `2'b00` is a binary number with two bits, both set to 0. The `{F_pc, 2'b00}` operation is a concatenation operation, appending the two-bit binary number '00' to the end of the value of register `F_pc`.
