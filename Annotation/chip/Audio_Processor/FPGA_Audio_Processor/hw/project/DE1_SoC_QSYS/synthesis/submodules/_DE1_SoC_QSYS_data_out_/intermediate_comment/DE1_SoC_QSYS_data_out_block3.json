    "block_comment": "This block implements a synchronous reset and write feature for a memory module. When the reset signal (`reset_n`) is active low, the output data (`data_out`) is cleared. Otherwise, if the control signals indicate that the chip is selected (`chipselect` is true), not in read mode (`write_n` is false), and the target address is 0 (`address == 0`), the output data is updated with the lower 16 bits of the written data (`writedata[15 : 0]`)."
