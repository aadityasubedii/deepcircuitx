This block of code corresponds to an assign statement. An assign statement in Verilog is used for continuous assignment for a signal. In this case, 'xbrk_goto0' is assigned a single bit value of 0, which means 'xbrk_goto0' will have a constant value of 0 throughout the design unless re-assigned differently somewhere else in the code.
