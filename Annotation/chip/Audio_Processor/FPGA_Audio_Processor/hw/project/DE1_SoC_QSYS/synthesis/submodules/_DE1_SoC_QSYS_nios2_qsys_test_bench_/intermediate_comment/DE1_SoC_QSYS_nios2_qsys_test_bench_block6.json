    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is essentially a debug check designed to halt simulation if an invalid unknown ('x') condition is encountered in the 'd_read' signal. Upon the positive edge of the clock signal, this block consistently check if 'd_read' signal is 'x' and if 'reset_n' signal is indeed 'reset'. If the invalid 'x' state is encountered, it outputs an error message indicating the precise simulation time instance that the error occurred and halts the simulation."
