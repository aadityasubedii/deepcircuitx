    "block_comment": "This block of code is performing an assignment operation in Verilog. It is assigning the value of the variable `oci_hbreak_req` to `oci_tb_hbreak_req`. In essence, the operation implies that whenever the `oci_hbreak_req` signal changes its value, the new value is instantly reflected in `oci_tb_hbreak_req`. This operation is commonly carried out in a design to propagate the signal value from one point of the system to another."
