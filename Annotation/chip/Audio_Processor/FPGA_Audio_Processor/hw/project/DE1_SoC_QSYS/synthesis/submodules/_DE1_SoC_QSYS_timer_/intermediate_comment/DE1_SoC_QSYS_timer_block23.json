    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a signal named `counter_is_zero`, used to indicate whether an internal counter (`internal_counter`) has a value of zero. This is accomplished via a continuous `assign` statement in Verilog, which constantly monitors the `internal_counter` for changes. When `internal_counter` equals zero, `counter_is_zero` will be assigned a value of true (1), otherwise, it will be false (0)."
