    "block_comment": "This block of code checks whether the asynchronous reset (ASYNC_RESET) is activated or not. The 'generate if' statement in Verilog is used to conditionally instantiate portions of the design, in this case, the sections are instantiated if ASYNC_RESET is true. The code inside the 'begin...end' will be executed only if ASYNC_RESET is on, allowing the system to reset under certain conditions. The specifics of the reset process, however, is not given in this snippet."
