    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a register transfer mechanism with safety conditions to prevent data overwrite. Upon a positive edge of reset or clock, the block primarily conducts data transfer from 'in_data' to 'data0' and 'data1'. When a reset signal is high, 'data0' and 'data1' are set to zero, else, according to the state of 'full0' and 'full1', 'in_data' is transferred to 'data0' and 'data1' respectively. If 'full0' is not set, 'in_data' is assigned to 'data0'. For 'data1' assignment, if 'full1' is not set or 'out_ready' and 'out_valid' are active, 'data1' either gets the value of 'data0' if 'full0' is high or else gets 'in_data'. This ensures data doesn't get overwritten while being prepared to be sent out."
