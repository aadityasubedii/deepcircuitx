    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is primarily a clock divider which is meant to slow down the input clock. The implementation works by counting up on each rising edge of the original clock signal until the specified threshold is reached which in this case is 'div'. When the counter reaches this designated threshold, the output clock signal 'clk_out' is toggled from its current state and the counter resets, ensuring that 'clk_out' only transitions at every 'div' number of 'clk' cycles. Thus, 'clk_out' runs 'div' times slower than 'clk'."
