    "block_comment": "The block of code controls an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) signed comparison operation. It's governed by the rise of the system clock or the fall of reset signal (asynchronous reset). If reset_n signal is pulled low i.e., a reset operation is performed, it resets the register R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison, effectively setting it to 0. Otherwise, if the enable signal (R_en) is high, the next value of the register (R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison_nxt) is loaded into R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison. Thus, it manages the state of R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison based on reset_n and R_en flags, and this happens synchronously with the system clock."
