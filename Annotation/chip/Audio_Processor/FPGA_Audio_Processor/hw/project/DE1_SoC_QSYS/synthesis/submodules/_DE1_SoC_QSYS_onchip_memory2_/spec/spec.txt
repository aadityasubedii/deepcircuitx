Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2. 

Module specification:
The DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2 is a module that represents a single-port 32-bit synchronous RAM with a capacity of 32,000 words. It utilizes Altera's "altsyncram" megafunction for instantiating the RAM. The module is controlled by various input signals: 'address' to select a specific location in the RAM, 'byteenable' to specifywhich bytes in the word are to be used, 'chipselect' which permits read/write operations on the RAM when high, 'clk' which is the governing clock signal, 'clken' which enables the clock when high, 'freeze' to disable dynamic power consumption, 'reset' to initialize the RAM, 'reset_req' to request a reset operation, 'write' for write operation indication, and 'writedata' which is the input data for writing into the RAM. The output from the module is 'readdata', a bus that carries data read from the RAM. 

Internally, the module uses 'clocken0', 'wren', and 'readdata' signals. 'Clocken0' controls the clock signal effect, 'wren' controls write operations, and 'readdata' is used to read data from the memory module 'altsyncram'. 

The module contains a block of code that instantiates 'altsyncram', wires the signals appropriately and sets necessary parameters such as byte size, memory depth, operation mode etc. Its behavior such as timing and system state response is determined by these parameters, input signals, and internal logics. This design provides the flexibility in controlling the operation of a large capacity memory in a single-port mode.
