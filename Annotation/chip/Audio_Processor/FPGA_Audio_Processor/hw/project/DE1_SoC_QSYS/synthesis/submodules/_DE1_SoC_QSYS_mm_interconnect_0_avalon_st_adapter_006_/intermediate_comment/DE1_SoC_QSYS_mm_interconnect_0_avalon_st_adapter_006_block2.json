    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a check for parameter misconfigurations. It outputs an error message and halts the program execution if invoked. Notably, it utilizes the `$display` and `$stop` system tasks: the former to log the error message, and the latter to cease system operation when the improper parameters are detected."
