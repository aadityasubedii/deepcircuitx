The module takes data from 'in_port' and the address from 'address'. Depending on the 'address' value, it extracts a 16-bit part of the data and presents it on 'readdata' at each positive edge of the clock or when it is not in a reset state. In particular, 'readdata' produces a 32-bit output where the lower 16 bits are selected by the 'address' and the rest are padded with zeroes. This module will reset and 'readdata' will be cleared when 'reset_n' is set to 0."

As it is always 1, every positive edge of the clock will lead to a read operation while the system is not in a reset state.\n- 'data_in' is another wire type signal, assigned to in_port.
