    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes a reset synchronizer chain in an Altera FPGA. It sets the sync tap request for reset (RSTREQ_ASRT_SYNC_TAP) to high (1'b1), which indicates that a reset is requested. This operation is performed at the beginning of simulation or when the circuit is first powered up. The code uses a non-blocking assignment which means the assignment will be done at the end of the current simulation time unit, hence not blocking any following executions in the same time unit."
