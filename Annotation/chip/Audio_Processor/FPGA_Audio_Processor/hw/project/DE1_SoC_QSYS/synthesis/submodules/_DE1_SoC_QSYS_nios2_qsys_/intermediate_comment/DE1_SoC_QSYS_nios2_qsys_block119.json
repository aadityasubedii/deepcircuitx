    "block_comment": "The given block of code is involved in status register updating. The value of `W_bstatus_reg_inst_nxt` depends on the conditions `R_ctrl_break` and `E_wrctl_bstatus`. If `R_ctrl_break` is true, current status register `W_status_reg`  will be assigned to `W_bstatus_reg_inst_nxt`. If `R_ctrl_break` is false and `E_wrctl_bstatus` is true, then the first bit (`E_src1[0]`) will be assigned to `W_bstatus_reg_inst_nxt`. If both `R_ctrl_break` and `E_wrctl_bstatus` are false, the value of `W_bstatus_reg_inst_nxt` remains the same as the current one (`W_bstatus_reg`)."
