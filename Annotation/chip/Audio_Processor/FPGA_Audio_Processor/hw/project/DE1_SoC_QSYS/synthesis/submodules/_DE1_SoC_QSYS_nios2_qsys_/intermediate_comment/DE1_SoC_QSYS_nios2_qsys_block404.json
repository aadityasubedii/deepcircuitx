    "block_comment": "The block resets or updates the `dbrk_break` signal, depending on the state of the `reset_n` and `debugack` signals. If `reset_n` is low, a negative edge-triggered reset occurs, setting `dbrk_break` to zero. Else, on the rising edge of the clock, `dbrk_break` is updated based on its own value and the `debugack` signal: if `dbrk_break` is true, it is complemented with `debugack`; otherwise, it catches the value of `dbrk_break_pulse`."
