The button's state is sampled at the rising edge of the system clock (clk). Addressable registers are provided to read the current state of the button (data_in), read and clear a rising edge capture state (edge_capture), and to mask/unmask interrupt requests (irq_mask). When the button state goes from low to high (rising edge) and interrupt requests are not masked (irq_mask not 0), an interrupt is triggered (irq)."
