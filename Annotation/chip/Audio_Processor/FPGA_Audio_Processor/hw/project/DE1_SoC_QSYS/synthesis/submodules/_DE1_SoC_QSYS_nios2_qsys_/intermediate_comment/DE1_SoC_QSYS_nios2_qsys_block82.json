    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a synchronous design primitive in Verilog RTL. The module resets or updates the 'R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br' variable depending on certain conditions. When the clock rises (positive edge) or the reset signal falls (negative edge), it triggers this block to execute. If the reset signal is not present ('reset_n' equals zero), the variable 'R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br' is reset to zero. However, if the enable signal 'R_en' is high, then 'R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br' takes the value of 'R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br_nxt' in the next clock cycle."
