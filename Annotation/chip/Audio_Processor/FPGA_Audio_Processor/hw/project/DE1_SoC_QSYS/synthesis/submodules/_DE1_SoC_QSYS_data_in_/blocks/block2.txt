Comment: 
This block of code performs data read operation in a synchronous manner. Upon receiving a positive edge clock signal or a negative edge reset signal, it resets the readdata if reset signal is active (0), otherwise, if the clock_enable is high during a clock cycle, it updates the readdata with the output of read_mux_out. The actual data is updated with the lower 32 bits of 'read_mux_out', while the rest of the bits are set to be zero.
