    "block_comment": "This code block controls the read operation of a FIFO memory module. If the Avalon-Chipselect (av_chipselect) signal is deasserted, read operation (av_read_n) is not happening, wait request (av_waitrequest) from the master is made, and the correct address (av_address) is not selected, it checks whether the FIFO memory is empty (fifo_EF) and performs a read operation if it is not empty, else output is made 0."
