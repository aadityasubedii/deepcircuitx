    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the 'fifo_5_enable' signal based on several conditions. The algorithm focuses primarily on the status of the FIFO write pointer along with conditions of input_ge1, input_ge2 and input_ge3. It enables the 'fifo_5_enable' signal if the write pointer is at position 5 and input_ge1 is true, or ge2_free is true and the write pointer incremented by one is at position 5 and input_ge2 is true, or ge3_free is true and the write pointer incremented by two is at position 5 and input_ge3 is true."
