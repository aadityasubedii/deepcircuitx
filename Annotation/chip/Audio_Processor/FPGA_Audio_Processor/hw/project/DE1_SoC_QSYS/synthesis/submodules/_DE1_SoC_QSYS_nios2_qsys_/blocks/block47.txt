The block assigns the next state of R_ctrl_alu_subtract with the current state of D_ctrl_alu_subtract. The assignment operation is performed continuously, making sure that R_ctrl_alu_subtract always reflects the value of D_ctrl_alu_subtract in the next simulation delta. This is achieved by using the assign statement in Verilog, which allows continuous assignments and is used primarily for connecting nets of hardware together.
