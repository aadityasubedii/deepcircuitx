Comment: 
This block describes a flip-flop cell with a reset and enable signal. Upon a negative edge reset signal, the `R_ctrl_ld_signed` register is cleared to 0. Concurrently, during the positive edge of the clock, if the enable (`R_en`) signal is true, then the next state (`R_ctrl_ld_signed_nxt`) of `R_ctrl_ld_signed` is loaded into the register on the next clock cycle.
