    "block_comment": "The block caters to different system configurations defined by the USE_PACKETS, ERROR_WIDTH, and CHANNEL_WIDTH parameters to assign contents to the in_payload, and out_payload variables. If USE_PACKETS is high, it includes packet signals; whereas, if it's low, out_packet_signals are assigned to zero. According to the ERROR_WIDTH, the error signals are part of the payload or directly assigned. The presence of the channel is checked through CHANNEL_WIDTH, and accordingly, channel signals are either part of the payload or directly assigned."
