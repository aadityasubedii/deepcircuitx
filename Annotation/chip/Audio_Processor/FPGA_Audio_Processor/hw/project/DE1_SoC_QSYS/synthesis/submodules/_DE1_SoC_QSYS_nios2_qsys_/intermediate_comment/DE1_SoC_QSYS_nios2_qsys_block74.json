    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the next state of the right arithmetic shift control in an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The new state of `R_ctrl_shift_right_arith_nxt` gets the current state of `D_ctrl_shift_right_arith`; this non-blocking assignment ensures that changes to the D input during the current clock cycle do not affect the output until the next clock cycle.\n"
