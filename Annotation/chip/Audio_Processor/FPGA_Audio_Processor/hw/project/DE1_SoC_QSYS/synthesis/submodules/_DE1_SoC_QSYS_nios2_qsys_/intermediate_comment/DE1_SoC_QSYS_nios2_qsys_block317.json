    "block_comment": "This block of code enables the fifo_1 function. Implementation-wise, it uses logical operators to determine different scenarios under which the fifo_1 function should be enabled. These scenarios are; if the write pointer(fifo_wrptr) is 1 and the input is greater or equal to 1 (input_ge1) or if the ge2_free flag is high and fifo_wrptr_plus1 is 1 and the input is greater or equal to 2 (input_ge2) or if the ge3_free flag is high and fifo_wrptr_plus2 is 1 and the input is greater or equal to 3 (input_ge3)."
