    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for creating the value for the variable `R_src2` by combining the values of two other variables `R_src2_hi` and `R_src2_lo`. It uses the concatenation operator (`{}`) of Verilog which combines the bit-stream values of `R_src2_hi` and `R_src2_lo` to form the value for `R_src2`. The bit-stream of `R_src2_hi` is put in the higher bit places and `R_src2_lo` is put in the lower bit places."
