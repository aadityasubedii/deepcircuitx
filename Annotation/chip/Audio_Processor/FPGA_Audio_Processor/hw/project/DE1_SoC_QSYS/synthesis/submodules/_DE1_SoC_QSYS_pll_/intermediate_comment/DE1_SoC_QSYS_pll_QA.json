Its main function is to generate outputs (outclk_0, outclk_1) with specific frequencies (143.000000 MHz) based on the input reference clock (refclk) and reset signals (rst). Additionally, it generates a locked signal indicating the lock status of the PLL. The locked signal generally indicates if the PLL is operating in phase with the input clock. The PLL here is operating in \"normal\" mode and it has a reference clock frequency set to 50.0 MHz. The PLL doesn't have a fractional multiplier, as the fractional_vco_multiplier is set to \"false\"."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: \n1. refclk: It is the reference clock input for the PLL. Explanation: The PLL system will use this reference clock frequency (in this case set to 50.0 MHz) as the base to generate other clock frequencies.\n2. rst: It is the Reset signal for the PLL. Explanation: This input is used to reset the PLL. Upon receiving a reset signal, the PLL will restart its operation.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. outclk_0: One of the PLL output clock signals. Explanation: This output clock signal is generated by the PLL based on the reference clock and parameters set within the module. The frequency for this clock is set to 143.000000 MHz in the module.\n2. outclk_1: Another PLL output clock signal. Explanation: This is another output clock signal, its frequency is also set to 143.000000 MHz. It might have different phase from the outclk_0 depending on phase configuration.\n3. locked: This is a boolean status signal. Explanation: The signal 'locked' is an output signal which indicates whether the PLL is locked or not. If the PLL is locked, it signifies that the output frequency and phase are stable and are as expected. This locked signal is often used for synchronizing the system which is using the PLL output clocks."

Here's the explanation for these:\n\n- fboutclk: Feedback output clock. It is typically a connection made from the internal output back to the PLL's input. The 'fboutclk' signal usually helps to enable the PLL to compare its output with the original input and adjust its phase and frequency accordingly. This signal helps to maintain the lock of the PLL. In the provided code, the feedback path for the output clock is not connected.\n\n- fbclk: This is the feedback input clock, however from the provided code, we are not using a feedback signal from the output. The value for this is statically defined as '1'b0' in the module. \n\nNote: This information is as per the understanding from the code fragment provided.
