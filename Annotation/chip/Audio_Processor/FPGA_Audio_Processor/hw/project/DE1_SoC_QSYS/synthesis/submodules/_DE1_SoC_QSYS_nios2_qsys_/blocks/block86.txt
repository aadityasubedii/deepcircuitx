The block of code provides an assignment operation for the control logic. This means that the next state of the control reset signal (`R_ctrl_crst_nxt`) is determined by the current state of `D_ctrl_crst` signal. This feature is necessary for synchronous designs where the state variables need to be updated at each clock cycle. In this specific block, the control reset signal's subsequent state copies the present state's control reset signal, without any logic transformation. Hence, the propagation delay would only be due to the wire interconnects.
