    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the selection of the next data byte through a multiplexer function. Depending on the conditional statements that evaluate `av_ld_rshift8` and `av_ld_extend`, it either shifts the current byte data `av_ld_byte3_data` right by 8 bits or extends it by filling with the bit value `av_fill_bit`. If neither of these conditions are true, it assigns the value of `d_readdata[31 : 24]` to `av_ld_byte3_data_nxt`."
