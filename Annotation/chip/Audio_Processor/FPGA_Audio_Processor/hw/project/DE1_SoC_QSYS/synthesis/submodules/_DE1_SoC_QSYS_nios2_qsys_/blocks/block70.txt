This block implements a synchronous reset and update of a register, R_ctrl_rot_right, used in a control scheme for a data rotation operation. Upon receiving a negative edge signal on the reset_n line, the block immediately sets the control register to 0, providing a kind of initialization. On a positive edge clock signal and if the R_en signal is high, the block updates the control register value to a new value, R_ctrl_rot_right_nxt, which is determined outside the block. This allows the control of the rotation operation to be updated in sync with the system clock.
