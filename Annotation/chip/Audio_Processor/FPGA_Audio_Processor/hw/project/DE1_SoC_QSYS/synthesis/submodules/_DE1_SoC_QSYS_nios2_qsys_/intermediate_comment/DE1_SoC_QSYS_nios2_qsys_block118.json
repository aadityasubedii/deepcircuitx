    "block_comment": "This block of code controls an update operation of the `W_bstatus_reg` register. It operates conditionally based on the `E_valid` signal. If the `E_valid` signal is high(true), then the `W_bstatus_reg` register is updated with the value of `W_bstatus_reg_inst_nxt`. Otherwise, the register retains its current value."
