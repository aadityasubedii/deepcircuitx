This block of code is involved in initializing and laying out the details for a testbench simulation. Notably, it employs "$write" system tasks to output elaborative text strings to the console. Specifically, these informative strings denote that the testbench integrates an SOPC Builder-Generated Altera model for Verilog simulation purposes. In performing SDRAM access simulations, the testbench directly leverages the 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component.v' model. To set the initial conditions for this simulation, the testbench makes use of the data file 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component.dat.'
