Comment: 
This Verilog RTL code line is responsible for assigning the value of 'D_ctrl_br_cmp' to 'R_ctrl_br_cmp_nxt' in the next clock cycle. It's a non-blocking assignment, implying that the assignment will not immediately affect the left-hand side (identifier) 'R_ctrl_br_cmp_nxt'. Rather, it waits until all other concurrent statements in the always block are executed. This type of assignment is used specifically in sequential logic, such as flip-flops or registers where you need the current data to remain unchanged during the execution of current clock cycle.
