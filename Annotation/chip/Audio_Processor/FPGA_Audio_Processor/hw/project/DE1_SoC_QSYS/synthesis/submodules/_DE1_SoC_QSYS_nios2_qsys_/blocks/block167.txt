The block of code functions as a synchronous reset circuit for the 'd_read' signal in a sequential logic circuit. On every positive edge of the clock signal or when the reset signal is active low, the logic within the always block is executed. When 'reset_n' is low, it asynchronously resets the 'd_read' signal to zero. If the 'reset_n' signal is not active (i.e., when it's high), the 'd_read' signal is set to the value of the 'd_read_nxt' signal on the next positive clock edge. This is a typical behavioral coding style in Verilog for handling signal assignments in synchronous logic circuits with reset functionality.
