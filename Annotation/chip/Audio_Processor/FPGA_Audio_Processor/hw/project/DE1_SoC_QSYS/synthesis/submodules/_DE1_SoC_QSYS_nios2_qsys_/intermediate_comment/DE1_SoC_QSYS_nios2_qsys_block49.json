    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the logic for a synchronous reset and the updating procedure of the 'R_ctrl_br' register. When a negative edge reset signal is encountered, the register 'R_ctrl_br' is cleared, ensuring the entire system resets to an initial condition. Whenever there exists a positive edge clock pulse without a negative edge from 'reset_n', and if the 'R_en' (enable input) is set, the contents of the buffer 'R_ctrl_br_nxt' are moved into 'R_ctrl_br'; this enables updating of the register value in a clock-controlled manner."
