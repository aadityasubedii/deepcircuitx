Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for handling the readiness of the input data in a storage structure, such as a FIFO queue or a buffer. When the storage structure isn't full (`!full`), it implies that it's ready to accept new input data, so `in_ready` is assigned the negation of `full`. Therefore, this block reflects the status of the structure's readiness to accept new inputs by keeping `in_ready` high (1) when storage isn't full and low (0) otherwise.
