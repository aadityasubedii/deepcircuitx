This block of code handles a synchronous reset for the `W_cmp_result`.

The logic in the block is triggered upon the rising edge of a clock (`posedge clk`) or the falling edge of a reset signal (`negedge reset_n`). If the reset signal is low (`reset_n == 0`), the `W_cmp_result` is set to zero, effectively resetting it. Otherwise, during the normal operation when the clock signal has a posedge, the `W_cmp_result` is updated with the value of `E_cmp_result`.
