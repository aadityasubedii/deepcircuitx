This is a block of Verilog code for a fully-parameterized Generic FIFO buffer. This FIFO buffer allows you to enqueue, dequeue, and check the status of the buffer. The operation of this buffer includes multiplexing data in/out and increasing or decreasing counters depending on enqueue and dequeue signals. It uses a shift register (shf_r) and read/write pointers that increment or decrement depending upon the enqueue & dequeue signals. For different instances of FIFO buffer, it uses generate block which automatically generates different FIFO buffers based on the parameter value.
