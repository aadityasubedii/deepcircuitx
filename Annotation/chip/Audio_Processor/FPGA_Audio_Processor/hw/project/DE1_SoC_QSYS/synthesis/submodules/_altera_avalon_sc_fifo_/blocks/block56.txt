Comment: 
This block of code principally acts as an error forwarding mechanism and data-channel assignment. If the error input (in_error) is detected, it simply gets forwarded to the error output (out_error). Furthermore, if the defined 'CHANNEL_WIDTH' is more than zero, the input payload is defined as a concatenation of 'in_data' and 'in_channel'. Simultaneously, 'out_data' and 'out_channel' are assigned values from 'out_payload'.
