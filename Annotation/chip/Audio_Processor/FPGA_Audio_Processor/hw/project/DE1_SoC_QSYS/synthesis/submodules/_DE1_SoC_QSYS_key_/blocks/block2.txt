This block is a sequential logic for a two-stage pipelining scheme with a reset and clock enable function. On a negative edge reset, both `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` are asynchronously cleared to 0. On a positive edge clock event that coincides with a high `clk_en`, `data_in` is latched into `d1_data_in` and the former `d1_data_in` is latched into `d2_data_in` creating a two stage pipeline.
