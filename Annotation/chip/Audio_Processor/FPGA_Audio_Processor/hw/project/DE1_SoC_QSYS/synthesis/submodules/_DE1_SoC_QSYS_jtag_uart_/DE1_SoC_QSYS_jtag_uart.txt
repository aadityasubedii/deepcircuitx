Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart module manages JTAG UART interface in DE1_SoC system. It handles the FIFO buffering operations, including read, write, and interrupt requests. It utilizes a collection of internal signals synchronized by a clock to control data flow and error handling. The core logic is implemented in always blocks driven by clock and reset signals. Sub-modules dedicated to read operation (DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_scfifo_r) and write operation (DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_scfifo_w) are used to manage the state of the FIFO buffer.
