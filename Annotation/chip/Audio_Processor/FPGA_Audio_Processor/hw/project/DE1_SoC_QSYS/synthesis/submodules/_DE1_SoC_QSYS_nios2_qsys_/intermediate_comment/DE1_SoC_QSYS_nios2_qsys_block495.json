    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to implement a debug acknowledge signal (debugack). The debugack signal is generated by negating the hbreak_enabled signal. This means that whenever the hbreak_enabled signal is active (i.e., set to 1), the debugack signal will be inactive (i.e., set to 0) and vice versa. This mechanism can be used to notify the debug device about whether hardware breakpoints are currently enabled or not in the system."
