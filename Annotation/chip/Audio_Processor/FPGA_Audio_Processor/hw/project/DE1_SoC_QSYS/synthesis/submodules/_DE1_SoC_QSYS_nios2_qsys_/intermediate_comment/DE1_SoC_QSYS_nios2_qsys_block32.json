    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code as per the provided snapshot is assigning the future state of the non-IO control load (R_ctrl_ld_non_io_nxt) from the present state (D_ctrl_ld_non_io). It is doing this assignment operation continuously which means this line of code is always active. This approach is a common part of state machine design in hardware where the upcoming state is derived from the current state."
