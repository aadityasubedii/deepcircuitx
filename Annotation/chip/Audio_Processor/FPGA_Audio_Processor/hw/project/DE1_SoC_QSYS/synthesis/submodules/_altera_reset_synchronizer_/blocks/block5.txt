This block of code functions as a reset synchronizer. Whenever there is a positive edge event on the reset input (reset_in), it synchronizes all the flip-flops in the chain to be in the reset state. The synchronizer uses an "always" block for clock edge detection and conditional statements for determining reset state behavior. In case of a reset, the whole chain of flip-flop registered bits, represented by 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain', is set high and 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out' is set to binary 1. If there is no reset, the synchronizer manages the state by shifting the 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain' and setting the most significant bit to 0 while the output takes the value of the least significant bit.
