This block manages the assignment of packet signal components based on the 'EMPTY_WIDTH' condition. If 'EMPTY_WIDTH' is greater than zero, it includes 'in_empty' in the 'in_packet_signals' and 'out_empty' in 'out_packet_signals'. Otherwise, it assigns 'in_error' to 'out_empty' and excludes 'in_empty' from 'in_packet_signals and out_packet_signals'. The 'generate' construct allows this conditional hardware generation based on compile-time constants.
