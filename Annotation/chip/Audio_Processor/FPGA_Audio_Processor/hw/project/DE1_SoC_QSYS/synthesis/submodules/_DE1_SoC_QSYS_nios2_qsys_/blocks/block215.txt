This block is responsible for address assignment in a jump instruction (Function of the block). Specifically, it is assigning the write address of the jump direct target (D_jmp_direct_target_waddr) the value from bits 6 through 31 of the instruction word (D_iw), allowing the part of the instruction containing the target address to be isolated for use elsewhere in the system (Implementation details of the block).
