This block of code is primarily responsible for data and payload assignment operations. The function of this block is conditional payload assignment, where different parts of a payload (in_data, in_error, in_channel) are assigned to different output signals (out_data, out_error, out_channel) based on condition checks of ERROR_WIDTH and CHANNEL_WIDTH. The out_packet_signals are initially assigned a value of 0. If ERROR_WIDTH is more than 0, in_data, in_error, and in_channel are bundled up as in_payload and later assigned to the corresponding output signals. If ERROR_WIDTH is 0 and CHANNEL_WIDTH is more than 0, only in_data and in_channel are bundled up as in_payload and assigned to the corresponding outputs. If both ERROR_WIDTH and CHANNEL_WIDTH are 0, only in_data is assigned to out_data, and the error and channel signals are directly mapped to each other.
