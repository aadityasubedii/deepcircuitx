    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a synchronous flip flop behavior for handling reset and update of control for direct jumps (`R_ctrl_jmp_direct`) in a digital system. If a negative reset ('reset_n') is triggered, the direct jump control ('R_ctrl_jmp_direct') is reset to zero. However, if the system is enabled ('R_en') and no reset is applied, `R_ctrl_jmp_direct` will instead update to the value of `R_ctrl_jmp_direct_nxt` at the positive edge of the clock ('clk'). The flip flop system promotes timing coherence and signal stability in the digital circuit verilog design."
