    "block_comment": "This block of code is a register operation process controlled by clock and reset signals. On each positive edge of the clock or whenever there is a positive edge on the reset signal, the block of code is triggered. When the reset signal is high, the values of both data1 and full1 variables are set to 0. However, when the reset is not triggered (in else block), and the in_ready signal is true, the code updates data1 with the input data (in_data), and full1 with the validation of the input data (in_valid)."
