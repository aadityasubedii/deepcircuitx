    "block_comment": "The given block of code in Verilog handles the reset functionality for a byte enable signal. At the positive edge of the clock signal or the negative edge of the reset signal, the logic is evaluated based on the condition of the reset signal. If the reset signal is activated (i.e., its value is 0), the byte enable signal's duty cycle (`d_byteenable`) will be reset to 0. Otherwise, during a normal operation (i.e., `reset_n` is not active), the value of `E_mem_byte_en` (byte enable for memory) will be assigned to `d_byteenable`."
