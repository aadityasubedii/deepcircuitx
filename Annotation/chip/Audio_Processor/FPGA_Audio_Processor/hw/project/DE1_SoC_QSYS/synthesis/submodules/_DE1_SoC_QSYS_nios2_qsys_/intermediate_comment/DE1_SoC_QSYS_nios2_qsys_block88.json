    "block_comment": "This block implements a flip-flop with asynchronous reset functionality for the control of a process break signal. The flip-flop activates on the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`) or on the falling edge of the reset signal (`reset_n`). When the hardware detects a reset (`reset_n == 0`), it immediately clears the state of the `R_ctrl_break` register to 0, overriding the current clock cycle. If no reset condition exists and the enable signal `R_en` is high, the next state of `R_ctrl_break` is determined by `R_ctrl_break_nxt` on the next clock cycle."
