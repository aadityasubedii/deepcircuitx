    "block_comment": "This block of code checks whether the constant `USE_MEMORY_BLOCKS` is set to 1. If `USE_MEMORY_BLOCKS` is set to 1, the code within the begin-end block labeled as `gen_blk13` will be synthesized. The `generate` keyword is used here which acts as a conditional compile-time directive, meaning the inclusion of the specified block `gen_blk13` is determined at the time of compilation based on the condition provided."
