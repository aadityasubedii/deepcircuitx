    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is primarily concerned with assigning a value to `R_src2_lo`. It achieves this through a ternary operation or a conditional assignment mechanism. If `R_ctrl_force_src2_zero` or `R_ctrl_hi_imm16` is true, `R_src2_lo` is set to a 16-bit zero. Else if `R_src2_use_imm` is true, `R_src2_lo` gets assigned the value of `D_iw_imm16`. But if both are false, `R_src2_lo` is assigned `R_rf_b` from the 15th to 0th element. This way it serves to manipulate values based on certain conditions."
