Comment: 
The block of code acts as a synchronous reset and data control. It responds to positive edge clock signals or negative edge reset signals. If a negative edge reset signal is encountered (i.e., `reset_n` equals to 0), it synchronously resets the `R_ctrl_crst` register to 0. Otherwise, if the enable signal (`R_en`) is high, the content of the `R_ctrl_crst` register gets updated with the next stage value `R_ctrl_crst_nxt` at each positive edge of the clock.
