The block selects an appropriate data source to be passed to the fifo_4_mux multiplexer, dependent on several conditions. It checks for various conditions like validity of itm, atm and dtm signals with related to the write pointers (both current and 'next'). If multiple conditions satisfy, it gives priority to itm, atm and dtm in order. The block design prioritizes fifo write pointer to be exactly 4 followed by the pointer+1 equal to 4. The overflowing conditions for incoming data are also managed in this block, by prioritizing itm and atm over dtm.
