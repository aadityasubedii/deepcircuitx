    "block_comment": "The code block performs conditional assignment for the value of `R_src1`. It calculates the source 1 operand based on various control signals. If `R_ctrl_br` and `E_valid` are set or if `R_ctrl_retaddr` and `R_valid` are set, `R_src1` is assigned the value of `{F_pc_plus_one, 2'b00}`. On the other hand, if `R_ctrl_jmp_direct` and `E_valid` flags are active, `R_src1` gets `{D_jmp_direct_target_waddr, 2'b00}`. If none of these conditions are true, `R_src1` retains its previous value `R_rf_a`. It uses ternary conditional operators (?, :) to make these assessments and assignments."
