    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for maintaining and updating the Program Counter (PC) in this hardware design. An always block is used to either reset or update `F_pc`, triggered by the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of `reset_n`. If `reset_n` assertion is low, `F_pc` will reset to the initial address `16809984`. Else, the `F_pc` value will be updated by `F_pc_nxt` value if `F_pc_en` assertion is high."
