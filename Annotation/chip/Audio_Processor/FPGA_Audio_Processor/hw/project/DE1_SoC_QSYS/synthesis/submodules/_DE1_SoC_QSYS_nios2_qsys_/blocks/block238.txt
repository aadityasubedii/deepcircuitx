This block of Verilog code is used to declare and initialize a wire with a name 'clkx2' with the value of 0. The "assign" statement in Verilog is used for continuous assignment. It implies that whenever there's a change in the righthand side expression, the lefthand side element is updated immediately. In this case, the value of 'clkx2' is constantly held at 0, and it does not change after this assignment.
