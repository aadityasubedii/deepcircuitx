    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a synchronous FIFO register or memory element (fifo_3) with input source from 'fifo_3_mux' and control from the 'fifo_3_enable' signal. The operations pivot on the active clock edge (positive) and the state of the asynchronous negative reset. On a system reset (reset_n == 0), the FIFO register is cleared or initialized to zero. In a non-reset active clock edge, if the fifo_3_enable is high, the fifo_3 register takes the value from 'fifo_3_mux'."
