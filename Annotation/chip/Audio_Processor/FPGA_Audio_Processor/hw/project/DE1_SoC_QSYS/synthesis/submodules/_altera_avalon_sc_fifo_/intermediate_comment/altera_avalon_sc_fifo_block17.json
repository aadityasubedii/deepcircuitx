    "block_comment": "This block represents a combinational logic block with a fallback condition to reset 'fill_level' to zero. In Verilog, the 'always @*' construct indicates that the block should be synthesised to combinational logic, meaning this block's outputs should be evaluated whenever there is any change in its inputs. However, as there are no inputs in this block, 'fill_level' will always be 0."
