    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines the functionality of an interrupt request (IRQ) mask in a system. The IRQ mask can be reset or updated under specific conditions, triggered by the system clock's positive edge or the negative edge of an active-low reset signal. On reset (reset_n == 0), the IRQ mask is cleared. If the chip is selected (chipselect == 1), there's not an ongoing write operation (~write_n == 1), and the targeted address equals 2, the IRQ mask gets updated with the value present on the 'writedata' bus."
