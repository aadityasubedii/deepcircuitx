    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a constant zero value to a 32-bit signal/variable named \"retired_pcb\". This operation is performed using the \"assign\" keyword, typical of continuous assignment in Verilog, implying that \"retired_pcb\" will always hold the value '0' during the simulation. This could mean that \"retired_pcb\" represents a cleared or idle state in a PCB (Process Control Block) model in the given context."
