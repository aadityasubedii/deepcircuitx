    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to assign a default value to the signal `dct_is_taken`. It sets the `dct_is_taken` signal to a binary zero ('1b0' denotes a one-bit binary number, which is 0 in this case). The use of 'assign' statement ensures that this default value is assigned whenever this piece of code gets executed. This initialization is crucial to ensure the correct functioning of further procedures that might use the signal `dct_is_taken`."
