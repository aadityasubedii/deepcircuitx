The block assigns three boolean values - itm_valid, atm_valid, and dtm_valid - into the switch_for_mux variable, which may work as a control signal for a multiplexer. The result is a 3-bit value depending on the current truth values of itm_valid, atm_valid, and dtm_valid. The intended multiplexer would use this three-bit control input to connect one of its eight inputs to its output.
