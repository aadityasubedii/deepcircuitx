    "block_comment": "This block of code is for resetting or updating a shift or rotate operation result register (E_shift_rot_result). The block works by responding to a positive edge of the clock signal or a negative edge of async reset (reset_n). If the reset signal is active-low (reset_n == 0), the shift/rotate result is set to default i.e., 0. Otherwise, on each rising clock edge, the shift/rotate result stores the new result value present on (E_shift_rot_result_nxt)."
