The code defines an always block triggered on every positive edge of clock or negative edge of the 'jrst_n' signal. If 'jrst_n' is 0, both 'atm' and 'dtm' are reset to 0. When 'jrst_n' is not zero, there are conditions based on 'cpu_d_write', 'cpu_d_wait' flags, 'record_store_addr', 'record_load_addr', 'record_store_data', and 'record_load_data' which are used to determine values of 'atm' and 'dtm'. These values are constructed based on evaluated conditions and padded versions of 'cpu_d_address_0', 'cpu_d_readdata_0', and 'cpu_d_writedata_0'. If the conditions are not met, both 'atm' and 'dtm' are reset to 0 again.
