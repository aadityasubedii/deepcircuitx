    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog defines a combinational logic for determining the internal output signal's validity. It does so by creating a dependency on the negation of the \"empty\" signal and the \"ok_to_forward\" signal. When the buffer isn't empty (the \"empty\" signal is LOW) and it's acceptable to forward (the \"ok_to_forward\" signal is HIGH), the internal output signal \"internal_out_valid\" is set to HIGH, indicating it's valid."
