    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the logic related to the av_ld_align_cycle register. It uses a type of memory architecture known as edge-triggered design logic. Essentially, the register (av_ld_align_cycle) gets updated with the value of the next state wire (av_ld_align_cycle_nxt) upon each clock cycle's rising edge. However, if the reset flag (reset_n) is lowered (i.e., set to 0), the register gets instantly reset to 0, regardless of the clock signal. This allows to asynchronously reset the av_ld_align_cycle register and also to maintain synchronization with the clock signal's pace."
