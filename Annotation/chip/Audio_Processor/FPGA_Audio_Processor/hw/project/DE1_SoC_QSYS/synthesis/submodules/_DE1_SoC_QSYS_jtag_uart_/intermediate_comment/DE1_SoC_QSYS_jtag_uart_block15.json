    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is implemented for managing data in a FIFO buffer. The `bytes_left` register, 32-bit wide, keeps track of remaining data in bytes. `fifo_EF` serves as a status indicator that becomes high when FIFO buffer is empty. The `fifo_rd_d` register control signal is issued to read data from the FIFO buffer. It's used to control the operation of reading from the FIFO."
