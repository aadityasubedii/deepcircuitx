Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for updating the states of two outputs: "reset_out" and "reset_req". The state of "reset_out" is determined by the status of "r_sync_rst", while "reset_req" takes the status of "r_early_rst". This is a combinatorial circuit as the always block is sensitive to all inputs. A change in any of the states reflects immediately on the outputs with no internal state stored.
