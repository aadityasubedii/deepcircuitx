Comment: 
The block manages a read data register with a synchronous reset. When reset is active (reset_n == 0), the 'readdata' is cleared to 0. If the reset is not active and the clock enable signal, 'clk_en', is high, the 'readdata' register catches the value from 'read_mux_out' on a positive edge of the clock cycle.
