    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code executes an asynchronous reset, clear operations, and multiplexes various conditions to update inter-thread communication (ITM) and other variables based on the program status. The block is triggered on clock positive edge or negative edge of the reset signal \"jrst_n\". If \"jrst_n\" is zero, a reset operation sets all the operational register values to zero. Alternatively, when \"jrst_n\" is not zero and either a trace clear operation is signaled or two hardcoded conditions are true, a similar clearing operation is performed. The else clause implements a complex state machine that updates registers and the ITM signal from conditions like \"prev_pid_valid\", \"curr_pid\" not matching \"prev_pid\", an instruction has retired, there's an exception or based on different \"pending_frametype\" signal states. The state machine also handles trace logging based on these conditions. The block concludes with handling an interrupt or defaulting the ITM signal to a null token."
