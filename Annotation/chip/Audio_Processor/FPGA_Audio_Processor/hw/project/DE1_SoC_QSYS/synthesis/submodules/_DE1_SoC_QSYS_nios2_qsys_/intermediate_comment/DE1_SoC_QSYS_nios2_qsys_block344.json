    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for setting different modes of operation mapped to different control bits. It uses a case construct to differentiate how the \"td_mode\" wire behaves according to the different 3-bit binary patterns from the \"ctrl_bits_for_mux\" input. Depending on the input value, \"td_mode\" is assigned a predetermined 4-bit binary value, effectively implementing a binary to binary mapping to control downstream operations in the hardware design."
