This line of Verilog code is performing an assignment operation. The function of this block is to assign the current state of D_ctrl_custom to the R_ctrl_custom_nxt in the next clock cycle. The implementation is straightforward, done using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog. This operation is combinatorial, not sequential, meaning the assignment takes place instantly upon change in the D_ctrl_custom value.
