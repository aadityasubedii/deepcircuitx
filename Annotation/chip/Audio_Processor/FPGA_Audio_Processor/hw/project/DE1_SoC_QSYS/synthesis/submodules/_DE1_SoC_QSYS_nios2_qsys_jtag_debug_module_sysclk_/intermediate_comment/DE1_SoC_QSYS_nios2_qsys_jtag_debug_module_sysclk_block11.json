    "block_comment": "The block of code is a conditional assignment statement that drives the \"take_action_tracemem_a\" signal. It sets this signal high if several conditions are simultaneously satisfied: the \"enable_action_strobe\" is high together with the instruction register (ir) equals to binary '01', and bit 37 of jdo register is low while bit 36 of jdo register is high. The block uses logical AND and not (~) operators to combine these conditions."
