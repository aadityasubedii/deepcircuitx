This block describes the functionality of the FIFO. On a positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the reset signal, it either sets the FIFO value to 0 (if the reset signal is 0), or it changes the FIFO value to 'fifo_14_mux' (if the 'fifo_14_enable' signal is high). This is how it controls the FIFO's state based on the system's condition and external signals.
