Comment: 
This block controls the state of the 'byteenable' signal based on certain conditions. The logic operates on the positive edge of the clock, 'clk', or the negative edge of 'jrst_n'. When 'jrst_n' is 0, 'byteenable' is forced to 0 immediately, regardless of other conditions. Otherwise, at the positive edge of the clock, the value of 'byteenable' is updated to the next state 'byteenable_nxt'.
