    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2. \n\nModule specification:\nThe DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2 is a module that represents a single-port 32-bit synchronous RAM with a capacity of 32,000 words. It utilizes Altera's \"altsyncram\" megafunction for instantiating the RAM. The module is controlled by various input signals: 'address' to select a specific location in the RAM, 'byteenable' to specifywhich bytes in the word are to be used, 'chipselect' which permits read/write operations on the RAM when high, 'clk' which is the governing clock signal, 'clken' which enables the clock when high, 'freeze' to disable dynamic power consumption, 'reset' to initialize the RAM, 'reset_req' to request a reset operation, 'write' for write operation indication, and 'writedata' which is the input data for writing into the RAM. The output from the module is 'readdata', a bus that carries data read from the RAM. \n\nInternally, the module uses 'clocken0', 'wren', and 'readdata' signals. 'Clocken0' controls the clock signal effect, 'wren' controls write operations, and 'readdata' is used to read data from the memory module 'altsyncram'. \n\nThe module contains a block of code that instantiates 'altsyncram', wires the signals appropriately and sets necessary parameters such as byte size, memory depth, operation mode etc. Its behavior such as timing and system state response is determined by these parameters, input signals, and internal logics. This design provides the flexibility in controlling the operation of a large capacity memory in a single-port mode.",

It is directly instantiated from the \"altsyncram\" megafunction of Altera. The RAM is interfaced through a variety of control signals such as chipselect, write, address, and byteenable. If chipselect and write permission are granted, the data from the \"writedata\" bus is written into the RAM at the location specified by the \"address\". During a read operation, it outputs data on the \"readdata\" bus corresponding to the address input. Also, the RAM initialization file is specified using a parameter \"INIT_FILE\". Finally, it incorporates signals such as \"clk\", \"clken\", \"freeze\", \"reset\", and \"reset_req\" to tune the operation timing and control the module's behavior in specific system states."

It is generated by logically ANDing 'clken' and the negation of 'reset_req' signal, implying that it will be true only when 'clken' is high, and 'reset_req' is low.\n\n- 'wren': This signal is used for controlling whether a write operation should be performed on the memory or not. It is generated by logically ANDing 'chipselect' and 'write' signal, implying that it will be true only when 'chipselect' and 'write' are both high.\n\n- 'readdata': even though this signal is declared as an output, it is also internally connected and used to read data from the memory module 'altsyncram'. This wire connects the output from the memory module to the module's output port of the same name. This way, whenever an addressed location in the memory is read, the data is automatically set on this output wire."
