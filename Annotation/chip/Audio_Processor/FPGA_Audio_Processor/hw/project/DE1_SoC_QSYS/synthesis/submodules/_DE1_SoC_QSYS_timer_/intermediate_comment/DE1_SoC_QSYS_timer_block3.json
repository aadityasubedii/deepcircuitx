    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for generating a control write strobe signal. The signal is generated by an AND operation between chip select and the inverted write signal, alongside a check to confirm if the address is equal to one. So, this block's purpose is to trigger the control write operation when the chip is selected, it's not in read mode (denoted by ~write_n, inversion of write signal), and the target address is 1."
