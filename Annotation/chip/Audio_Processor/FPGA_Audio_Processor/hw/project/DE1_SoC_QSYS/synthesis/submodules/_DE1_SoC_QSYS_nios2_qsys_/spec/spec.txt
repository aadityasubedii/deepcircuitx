Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys. Module specification: This module implements a NIOS II processor core, containing the main datapath and control logic for executing NIOS II instructions. It includes instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and writeback stages. The module has input ports for clock, interrupts, data and instruction memory interfaces, and JTAG debug signals. Output ports include address and control signals for data and instruction memory, and debug-related outputs. Key internal signals include pipeline registers for different stages (F_, D_, E_, R_, W_), control signals for various operations, and ALU-related signals. The module is organized into several main blocks: instruction fetch and decode logic, register file, execution unit with ALU, memory access logic, and writeback logic. It also includes debug and interrupt handling capabilities, as well as support for custom instructions and various arithmetic
