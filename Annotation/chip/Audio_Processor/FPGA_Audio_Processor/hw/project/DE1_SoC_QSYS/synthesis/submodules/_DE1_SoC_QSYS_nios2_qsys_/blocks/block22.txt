This block of code in Verilog handles the reset and update of a flag (`R_ctrl_b_is_dst`) in a latching system. It specifically operates on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`) signal or on the falling edge of the (`reset_n`) signal. If reset (`reset_n`) is active (which is in this case is indicated by a zero), then the flag (`R_ctrl_b_is_dst`) is reset to 0. On the other hand, if reset is not active and the enable signal (`R_en`) is high, then the value of the flag (`R_ctrl_b_is_dst`) is updated to the next state value (`R_ctrl_b_is_dst_nxt`) on the rising edge of the clock.
