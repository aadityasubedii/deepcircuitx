    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a continuous assignment in Verilog RTL design. It assigns a permanent value of 0 to the wire 'dbrk2_high_value'. Thus, regardless of the state of the system or other variables, 'dbrk2_high_value' will always hold the value 0. This is essentially a constant declaration within the system's logic, serving as a high-value resistor in the circuit design to prevent floating."
