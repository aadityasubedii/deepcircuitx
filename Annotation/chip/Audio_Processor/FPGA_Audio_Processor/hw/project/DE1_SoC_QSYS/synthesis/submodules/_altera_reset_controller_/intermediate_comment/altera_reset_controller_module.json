    "module": "Module-level comment: The altera_reset_controller module manages and synchronizes reset signals in a digital system. It accepts multiple reset and reset request inputs, merges them following synchronization, and provides an output reset and reset request signal. Internal signals are used for managing synchronization, metastability, and generating the final reset signals. The code utilizes multiple blocks for parameter definition, signal synchronization, managing reset chains, and output generation."
