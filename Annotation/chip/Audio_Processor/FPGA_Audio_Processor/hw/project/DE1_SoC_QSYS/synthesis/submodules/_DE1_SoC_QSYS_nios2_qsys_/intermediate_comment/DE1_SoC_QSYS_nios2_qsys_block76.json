    "block_comment": "The given Verilog RTL code block is responsible for updating a register called R_ctrl_shift_logical. This block is activated on either a rising edge of the clock signal (clk), or a falling edge of the reset (reset_n), and uses both synchronous and asynchronous operations to control the state of the register. If an active-low reset (reset_n) is detected, an asynchronous operation sets the R_ctrl_shift_logical register to zero. However, if there's no reset, and the 'enable' signal (R_en) is triggered, a synchronous operation based on the rising edge of the clock signal will update the R_ctrl_shift_logical register with the next value (R_ctrl_shift_logical_nxt).\n"
