Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code controls the read handle for 'd'. The 'd_read_nxt' signal gets assigned whenever a new instruction ('E_new_inst') is loaded under control load ('R_ctrl_ld') or if the previous read signal ('d_read') is still waiting for the request to be fulfilled ('d_waitrequest'). Here, the bitwise OR operation ensures either of these conditions can set 'd_read_nxt' high.
