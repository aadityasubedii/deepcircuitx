Comment: 
The block assigns the value of the logical OR operation between `D_op_srai` and `D_op_sra` to `D_ctrl_shift_right_arith`. This operation effectively checks if either `D_op_srai` or `D_op_sra` is set (typically signaling an arithmetic shift right operation) and captures this state in the `D_ctrl_shift_right_arith` signal. This is used for controlling the right-side arithmetic shift of the data flow.
