This block of code is responsible for assigning a value to `fifo_wrptr_inc` based on specific conditions. Depending on whether the two flags `ge3_free` or `ge2_free` are set, and also considering the value of `input_tm_cnt`, `fifo_wrptr_inc` is determined. If `ge3_free` is set and `input_tm_cnt` equals 3, it assigns the value 3 to `fifo_wrptr_inc`. If `ge2_free` is set and `input_tm_cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it assigns the value 2 to `fifo_wrptr_inc`. Else if `input_tm_cnt` is greater than or equal to 1, it assigns the value 1 to `fifo_wrptr_inc`. If none of these conditions hold, it assigns 0 to `fifo_wrptr_inc`. This controls the increment of FIFO's write pointer, hence managing the FIFO queue's operations.
