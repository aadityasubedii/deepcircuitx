Comment: 
This block of Verilog code corresponds to a specific write strobe operation for a hardware snapshot functionality. It generates a write strobe signal (`snap_h_wr_strobe`) whenever the chip is selected (`chipselect` is high), it is a write operation (`write_n` is low), and the operation is intended for the address `5`. The expression uses bitwise AND and equality comparison operations to produce the final signal.
