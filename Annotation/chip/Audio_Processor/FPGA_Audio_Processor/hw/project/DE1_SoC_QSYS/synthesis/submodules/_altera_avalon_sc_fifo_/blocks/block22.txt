Comment: 
This block of code primarily handles packet length resetting and updating in a synchronous circuit. On a positive edge of the clock or a positive edge of the reset signal, it checks if the reset signal is high. If the reset signal is high, it resets the `curr_packet_len_less_one` to 0. If the reset signal is not high and a write operation is signaled, it increments the value of `curr_packet_len_less_one`. Additionally, if the `in_endofpacket` signal is high during a write operation, it signifies the end of packet and also prompts resetting `curr_packet_len_less_one` to 0.
