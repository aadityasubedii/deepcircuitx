    "block_comment": "This block of code performs the function of updating the output variables `out_valid` and `out_payload` based on their corresponding internal variables `internal_out_valid` and `internal_out_payload`. It is implemented as an `always @*` block in Verilog RTL, which means it is sensitive to any changes in the values of its internal variables, and the updates happen immediately whenever these internal variables change. The `begin` and `end` keywords encapsulate the block to define the scope of the update operation."
