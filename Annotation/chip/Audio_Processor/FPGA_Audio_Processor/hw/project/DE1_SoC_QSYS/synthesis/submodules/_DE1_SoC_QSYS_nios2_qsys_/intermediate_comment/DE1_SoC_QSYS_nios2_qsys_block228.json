    "block_comment": "This block of code determines the next state of the hardware breakpoint pending signal (`hbreak_pending_nxt`). It works by checking if a hardware breakpoint (`hbreak_pending`) is presently active. If it is, the next state depends on whether the hardware breakpoint is enabled (`hbreak_enabled`). Otherwise, the future state of the hardware breakpoint pending signal is dictated by the hardware breakpoint request (`hbreak_req`)."
