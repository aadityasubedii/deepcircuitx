    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog RTL code is responsible for updating the value of the signal 'R_ctrl_jmp_direct_nxt'. The block of code achieves this function by using the 'assign' keyword, which in Verilog, is used to continuously assign a value to a wire or a reg. The value being assigned to 'R_ctrl_jmp_direct_nxt' is the current value of 'D_ctrl_jmp_direct'. In essence, 'R_ctrl_jmp_direct_nxt' is updated with the value of  'D_ctrl_jmp_direct' every time there is a change."
