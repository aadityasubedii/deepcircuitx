    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for loading a counter with a value. It does this by concatenating the high (`period_h_register`) and low (`period_l_register`) register values, creating a more significant binary number that is then assigned to `counter_load_value`. The use of concatenation allows for significant flexibility in terms of numerical range for the counter."
