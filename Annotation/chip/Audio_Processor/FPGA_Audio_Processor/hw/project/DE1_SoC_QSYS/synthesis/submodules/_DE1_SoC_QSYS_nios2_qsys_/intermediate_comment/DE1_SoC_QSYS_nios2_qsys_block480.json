    "block_comment": "This block performs extraction and interpretation of bit slice information from the 'jdo' data structure, and combines break signals for an action determination. The specific attributes 'break_a_wpr', 'break_a_wpr_high_bits', 'break_a_wpr_low_bits', 'break_b_rr', and 'break_c_rr' are assigned values from specific bits of 'jdo'. These bits are separated into high and low bits for further usage. Further, a logic OR operation is performed on 'take_action_break_a', 'take_action_break_b' and 'take_action_break_c' to produce 'take_action_any_break', which decides whether any break action needs to be taken."
