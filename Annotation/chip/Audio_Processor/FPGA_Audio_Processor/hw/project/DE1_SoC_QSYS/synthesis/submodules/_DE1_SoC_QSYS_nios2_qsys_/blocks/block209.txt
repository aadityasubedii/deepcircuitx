Comment: 
This block of code is a synchronous flip-flop with active-low reset, serving as logic to decide whether to use immediate values or not in the operation. With every positive edge of the clock or whenever the reset signal is low, the state changes. If the reset signal is low, the value '0' is stored indicating immediate values are not to be used. If not under reset, the block calculates whether the values should be sourced from immediate values by logically OR-ing the signals determining whether the immediate value should be chosen and whether the operation is a valid branch instruction.
