    "block_comment": "This block is a multiplexer control assignment for a FIFO buffer with conditions that depend on the current write pointer status, the status of the incoming data, and the free space in the buffer. It processes which data to push into the buffer 'fifo_1_mux'. The decision is based on a priority order, favoring 'itm', then 'overflow_pending_atm', and lastly 'overflow_pending_dtm'. If the write pointer is at position 1 and only 'itm' is valid, 'itm' is selected. If either 'atm' or 'dtm' is also valid, they are chosen instead. If the write pointer is not at position 1 but there's free space, and multiple inputs are valid, 'overflow_pending_dtm' has the highest priority. If none of the prior conditions are met, 'overflow_pending_dtm' is selected by default."
