    "block_comment": "The block of code implements a synchronous reset circuit for the 'E_invert_arith_src_msb' signal. Upon detection of either rising edge of 'clk' or falling edge of 'reset_n', the signal 'E_invert_arith_src_msb' is updated. If 'reset_n' is detected as low(logical 0), it will reset 'E_invert_arith_src_msb' to 0 irrespective of the other conditions. If 'reset_n' is not active, 'E_invert_arith_src_msb' is calculated based on the logical AND operation of 'D_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison' and 'R_valid'."
