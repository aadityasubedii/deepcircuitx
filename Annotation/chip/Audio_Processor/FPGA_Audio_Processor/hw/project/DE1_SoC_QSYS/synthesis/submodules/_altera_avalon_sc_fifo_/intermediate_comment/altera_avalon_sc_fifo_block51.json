    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of the `next_rd_ptr` to the `mem_rd_ptr`, effectively updating the read pointer for the memory. It's a simple, direct assignment operation implemented via the 'assign' keyword in Verilog, often used for continuous assignment statements, implying this operation is performed continually based on the value of the `next_rd_ptr`."
