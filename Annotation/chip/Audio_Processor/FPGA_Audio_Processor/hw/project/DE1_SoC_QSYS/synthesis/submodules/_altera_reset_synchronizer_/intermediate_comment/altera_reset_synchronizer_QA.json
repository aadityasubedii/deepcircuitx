The module length of the synchronization chain is determined by the DEPTH parameter. If ASYNC_RESET is '1' then the reset occurs at positive edge of system clock or reset input signal. The reset signal set to '1' is propagated down the chain to reset output. If ASYNC_RESET is '0', the reset occurs only at positive edge of system clock. The reset signal input is passed down to the reset output in a chain manner as specified by the DEPTH parameter. Both cases ensure the reset signal is synchronized to the system clock to avoid metastability."
