This block is a clocked synchronous reset logic for a control signal. When there is a falling edge on the reset signal (reset_n is '0'), the control logic state (R_ctrl_logic) is reset to '0'. During a clock's positive edge, when the enable signal (R_en) is high, the current control logic state is updated to the next state (R_ctrl_logic_nxt).
