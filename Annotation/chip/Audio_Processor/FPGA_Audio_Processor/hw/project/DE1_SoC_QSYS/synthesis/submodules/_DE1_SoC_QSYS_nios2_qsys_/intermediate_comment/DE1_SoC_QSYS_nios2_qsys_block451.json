    "block_comment": "This block of code introduces a wire named 'xbrk0_goto0_hit' and assigns it a default value of 0. This is achieved by utilizing the assign keyword in Verilog, which is used for continuous assignment statements. The wire 'xbrk0_goto0_hit' remains at the value of 0 unless otherwise assigned in the script."
