Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is a simple assignment operation. The `tracemem_on` signal gets the value of the `trc_enb` signal. This is the essential function of the line. Implementation-wise, the `assign` keyword is used in continuously driven assignments that reflect value changes instantaneously, always making `tracemem_on` follow the current value of `trc_enb`. This typically signifies that the `tracemem_on` signal is used to mirror or track the enable status of some trace memory, as denoted by the `trc_enb` signal. Please refer to the original source code for more context about the system design and interconnections.
