Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is for handling FIFO overflow conditions. Effectively, it checks if a write pointer (`fifo_wrptr`) is equal to the value `4'd9` (decimal 9), and if an `atm_valid` signal is true; if both conditions are met, an overflow condition (`overflow_pending_atm`) is triggered. This allows the system to manage situations where data buffering goes beyond the available capacity.
