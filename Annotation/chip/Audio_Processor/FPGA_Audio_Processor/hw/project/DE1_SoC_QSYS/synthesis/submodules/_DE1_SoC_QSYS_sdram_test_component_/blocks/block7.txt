This block of code writes a value to a memory array at a specific address on every rising edge of the write clock, if the write enable signal is high. It uses an "always" block to constantly monitor the write clock. In the block, the code checks if the write enable ('wren') signal is high; if it is, the 'data' is written to 'mem_array' at the address 'wraddress'.
