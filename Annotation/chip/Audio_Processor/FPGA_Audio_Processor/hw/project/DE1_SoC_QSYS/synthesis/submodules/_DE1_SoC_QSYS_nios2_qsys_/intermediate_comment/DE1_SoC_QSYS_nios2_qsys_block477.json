    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a fixed low value to the wire `dbrk0_low_value`. This operation is performed using the `assign` keyword in Verilog, which continually drives the target wire `dbrk0_low_value` with the value `0`. This is typically used to initialize a signal or to represent a constant signal in a design.\n"
