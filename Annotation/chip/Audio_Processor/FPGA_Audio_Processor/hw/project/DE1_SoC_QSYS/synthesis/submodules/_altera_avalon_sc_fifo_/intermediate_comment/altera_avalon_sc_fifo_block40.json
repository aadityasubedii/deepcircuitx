    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a synchronous positive-edge triggered counter with an asynchronous reset. The counter increments by a value of '1' at each rising edge of the clock given reset signal is deasserted. The block begins behaving when the reset input signal goes high, it resets the count to zero regardless of the state of the clock. However, if the reset signal stays low during the rising edge of the clock signal, the counter value increases by one. This mechanism is implemented using a conditional (\"if-else\") construct, wherein if the reset signal is active, the counter output is set to zero, otherwise, it's incremented by one in response to a clock edge.\n"
