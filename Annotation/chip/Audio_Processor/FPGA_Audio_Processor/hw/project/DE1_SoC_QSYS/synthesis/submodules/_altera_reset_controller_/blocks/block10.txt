Comment: 
This block is a conditional reset synchronizer for Verilog systems. If there are no designated output reset sync edges and reset request isn't present, it merely assigns 'merged_reset' and 'merged_reset_req_in' to 'reset_out_pre' and 'reset_req_pre' respectively. Otherwise, it employs the Altera reset synchronizer module with adjustable depth, which synchronizes the applied reset signals to prevent metastability. The first instance of the Altera Reset Synchronizer is to handle the system reset condition while the other handles the reset request condition. Both are asynchronous, and their reset status is determined by 'merged_reset' and 'merged_reset_req_in' respectively, which are subsequently outputted through 'reset_out_pre' and 'reset_req_pre'.
