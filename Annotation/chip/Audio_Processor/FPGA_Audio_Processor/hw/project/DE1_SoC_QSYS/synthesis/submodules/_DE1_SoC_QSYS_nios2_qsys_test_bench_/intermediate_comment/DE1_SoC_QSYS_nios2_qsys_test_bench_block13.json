    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for handling a system reset under a positive edge clock condition (Function of the block). It checks if a reset is not in progress (indicated by \"reset_n\") and if the exclusive OR of W_valid is unknown, it raises an error and stops the system. It achieves this using the always block, which is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock signal clk. Additionally, if the result is unknown ('x'), an error message with the corresponding timestamp is printed on the console and the execution is halted through the `$stop` system task call (Implementation details of the block). Comparatively, the block uses conditional statements inside a sequential always block for error handling."
