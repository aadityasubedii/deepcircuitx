    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a pipeline register, specifically concerned with register write data validation under certain conditions. When system reset signal (reset_n) is low, the register is reset (Reset operation not specified, which might mean no specific action is taken during this state). In the absence of a reset signal, the register carry out the operation detailed by the system clock edge. It checks if the write operation is valid and whether the destination register location is signified to write. If all conditions are valid, it further checks the integrity of the write data (W_wr_data). If this data is found to be undefined ('x'), it prompts an error message and stops the system."
