    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a sequential logic block that is sensitive to a rising edge of the clock (clk) signal and to a falling edge of the reset (reset_n) signal. If the reset_n signal is low, it initiates the reset condition. Otherwise, if W_valid (write valid signal) and R_ctrl_ld signals are high, an unbiased condition is checked on av_ld_data_aligned_unfiltered. If this signal exhibits an undefined state (i.e., 'x'), a warning message is printed, suggesting an undefined state of av_ld_data_aligned_unfiltered at the current time instance."
