    "block_comment": "This block is designed for synchronizing reset or updating registers with a valid write. It is clocked at the rising edge of 'clk' or falling edge of 'reset_n'. When 'reset_n' is low, it initiates a system reset. Failing that, it checks if 'W_valid' and 'R_wr_dst_reg' are asserted. If both signals are true and 'R_dst_regnum' contains a don't-care value, it logs an error message indicating that 'R_dst_regnum' is unknown and then halts the system."
