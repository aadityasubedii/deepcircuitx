    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for conditional data assignment for `W_wr_data_non_zero`. It employs a ternary operator for the assignment based on certain control signals. First, it checks the `R_ctrl_br_cmp` signal: if it's true, `W_cmp_result` is assigned; if it's false, control goes to another condition, `R_ctrl_rdctl_inst`. If this is true, `W_control_rd_data` is assigned. If both conditions are false, it defaults to assigning `W_alu_result[31 : 0]`."
