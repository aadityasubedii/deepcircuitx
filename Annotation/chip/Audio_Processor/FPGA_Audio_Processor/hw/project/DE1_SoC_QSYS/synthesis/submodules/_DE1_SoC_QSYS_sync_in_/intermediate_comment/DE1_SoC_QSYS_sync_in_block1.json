    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for edge detection within a digital signal. It accomplishes this task by implementing a falling edge detector, which recognizes when a signal transitions from a high state ('1') to a low state ('0'). This is achieved by logically ANDing the current input `d1_data_in` with the inverse (`~`) of the delayed input `d2_data_in`. When the current input is high and the delayed input is low, i.e., a falling edge is detected, then `edge_detect` will evaluate to true ('1')."
