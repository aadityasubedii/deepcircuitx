Comment: 
This block is meant for defining a signal named 'instr_retired'. The function of this block is to always assign a constant logical low (0) to the signal 'instr_retired'. This gets implemented with the keyword 'assign' which in Verilog is used to continuously assign a value to a net. Thus, the output of this block would be a 'instr_retired' signal that always remains zero.
