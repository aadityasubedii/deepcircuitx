    "block_comment": "This block manages the operation of a digital counter. It assigns control signals that start or stop the counter based on a few conditional inputs. The `start_strobe` input sets the `do_start_counter`, starting the counter's operation when it's high. The `do_stop_counter` gets set to halt the counter's operation if either the `stop_strobe` is active, a force reload condition is triggered (`force_reload`), or if the counter has reached zero and the `control_continuous` signal directs non-continuous operation."
