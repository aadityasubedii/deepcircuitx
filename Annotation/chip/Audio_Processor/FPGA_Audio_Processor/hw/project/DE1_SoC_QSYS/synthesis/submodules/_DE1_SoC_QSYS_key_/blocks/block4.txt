Comment: 
This block of code serves as an edge detection and capturing mechanism, synchronised with a system clock and includes a reset capability. During a negative reset trigger, it resets the `edge_capture[2]` register to 0. When the system clock initiates a positive edge and if `clk_en` is true, the block evaluates `edge_capture_wr_strobe` and `edge_detect[2]`. If `edge_capture_wr_strobe` is true, it resets `edge_capture[2]`. If `edge_detect[2]` signal is perceived, it sets `edge_capture[2]` to -1, thus capturing the edge and holding its status.
