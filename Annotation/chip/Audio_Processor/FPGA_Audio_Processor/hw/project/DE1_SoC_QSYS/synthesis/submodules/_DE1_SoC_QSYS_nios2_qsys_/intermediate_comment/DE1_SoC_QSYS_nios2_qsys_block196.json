    "block_comment": "This block assigns the stall signal for the execution stage of the pipeline. It does this by using the bitwise OR operation on four input signals: `E_shift_rot_stall`, `E_ld_stall`, `E_st_stall`, and `E_ci_multi_stall`. Each of these signals represents a potential cause of pipeline stall, such as a stall caused by shift/rotate operation, load operation, store operation, or a carry-in multiplication operation. If any one of them is high, the execution stage of the pipeline will stall."
