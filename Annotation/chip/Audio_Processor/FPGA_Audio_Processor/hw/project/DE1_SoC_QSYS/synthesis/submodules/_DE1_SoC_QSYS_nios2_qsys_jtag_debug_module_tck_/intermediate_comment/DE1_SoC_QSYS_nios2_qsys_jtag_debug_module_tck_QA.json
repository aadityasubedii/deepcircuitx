The purpose of this module is to shift and store the appropriate data based on the JTAG instructions received and state of certain controls (like vs_cdr, vs_sdr, vs_uir). The module is mainly used for debugging, monitoring and tracing operations. This hardware component aids in real-time tracing and debugging functionalities of the system while connected via a JTAG interface. The data register (dr) sizes are adjusted for each different instruction code. It also syncs with input signals like debugack and monitor_ready using the altera_std_synchronizer."
