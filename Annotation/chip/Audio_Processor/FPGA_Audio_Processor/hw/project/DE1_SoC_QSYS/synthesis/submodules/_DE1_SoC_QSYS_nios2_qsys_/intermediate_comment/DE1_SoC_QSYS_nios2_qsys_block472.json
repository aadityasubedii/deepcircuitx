    "block_comment": "This piece of Verilog RTL code deals with the assignment of a certain value to the `dbrk_hit2_latch` signal. Specifically, it assigns the binary value '0' to `dbrk_hit2_latch`. This operation is performed with the use of the `assign` keyword, which provides a continuous assignment statement, continuously driving the value of '0' to `dbrk_hit2_latch`. The code essentially functions to keep `dbrk_hit2_latch` at a constant low level ('0')."
