Comment: 
The block of code is instantiating an Altera standard synchronizer. The synchronizer is used to mitigate the effects of metastability while transferring data between clock domains. `tck` is being used as the clock input, `debugack` as the data input, `debugack_sync` as the data output, and `unxcomplemented_resetxx1` is for the active low asynchronous reset. The data input, `debugack`, will be safely synchronized to the clock domain of `tck` and outputted as `debugack_sync`. In case of a reset event indicated by `unxcomplemented_resetxx1`, the synchronizer will be asynchronously reset.
