The block of code controls the fill level of a FIFO memory. It first copies the fill level from the fifo_fill_level signal to the local fill_level signal. Then, if the EMPTY_LATENCY parameter is set to 3, it increments the level by concatenating {ADDR_WIDTH{1'b0}} with the out_valid signal, effectively adding the boolean value of out_valid to the fill_level in a way that accounts for the bus width. This approach provides reliable information about the FIFO status, ensuring no loss or overlap of data during operations.
