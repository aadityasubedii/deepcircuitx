    "module": "Module-level comment: These Verilog RTL modules, DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_input_efifo_module and DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram, cooperate to manage memory in a FPGA board. The efifo module implements a two-entry FIFO buffer for managing read/write operations, with status reports available as output signals. The sdram module is a primary controller for an SDRAM memory device. It manages read/write requests, refresh operations and interfaces with the FIFO module. The state machines within both modules and various internal registers maintain operation control and status. The combined modules offer robust and efficient memory management in hardware designs."
