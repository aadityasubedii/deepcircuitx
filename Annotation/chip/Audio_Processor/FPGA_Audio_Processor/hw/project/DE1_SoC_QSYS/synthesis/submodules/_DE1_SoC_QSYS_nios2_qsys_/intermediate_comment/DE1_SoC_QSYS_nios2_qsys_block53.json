    "block_comment": "This statement in Verilog is called a continuous assignment statement, which drives the value of `D_ctrl_br_uncond` to `R_ctrl_br_uncond_nxt`. The block simply assigns or copies the value from `D_ctrl_br_uncond` to `R_ctrl_br_uncond_nxt` in the next state. Thus, it behaves like a buffer or a wire, with the value change in `D_ctrl_br_uncond` being immediately reflected in `R_ctrl_br_uncond_nxt`. This possibly forms part of the next-state logic in a state machine design."
