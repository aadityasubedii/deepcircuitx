    "block_comment": "This block serves as an overflow protection feature for a FIFO mechanism handling the DTM (Debug Transport Module) inputs. Specifically, it compares the current position of the FIFO write pointer (fifo_wrptr) with the value 9 (binary: 1001). If the write pointer is at position 9 and a valid DTM input (dtm_valid) is present, the block is set to trigger an overflow indication (overflow_pending_dtm). This ensures that no data will be lost due to overwriting, enhancing the reliability of the design."
