    "block_comment": "This block of code is defining a trigger_state_0 wire signal. It works by assigning the inverse or complement ('~') of the value of the signal trigger_state to the signal trigger_state_0. This is typically used for logic flip operations in digital design where trigger_state_0 receives the opposite state of trigger_state."
