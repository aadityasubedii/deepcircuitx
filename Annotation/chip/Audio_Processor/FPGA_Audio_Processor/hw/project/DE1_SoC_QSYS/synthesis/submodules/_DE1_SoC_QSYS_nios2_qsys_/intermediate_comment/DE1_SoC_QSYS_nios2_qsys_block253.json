    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code assigns the inversion of the 9th bit of the 'trc_ctrl' register to the 'trc_on_chip' signal. This inversion is implemented using a bitwise NOT operator (~), which returns a 1 where the original bit was a 0 and vice versa. From this operation, it can be inferred that the 'trc_on_chip' signal is enabled when the 9th bit of 'trc_ctrl' is at low or '0' state."
