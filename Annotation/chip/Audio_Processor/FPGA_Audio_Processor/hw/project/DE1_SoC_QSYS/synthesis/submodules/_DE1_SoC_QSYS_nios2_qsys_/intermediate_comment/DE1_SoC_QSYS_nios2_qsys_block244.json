    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a synchronous process for updating the 'debugaccess' register. The register is updated at each positive edge of the clock signal or at a negative edge of 'jrst_n' signal. Functionally, the code resets the 'debugaccess' register when 'jrstn' is at a logic low (0). When 'jrstn' is not low, 'debugaccess' takes on the value of the next state logic, 'debugaccess_nxt'."
