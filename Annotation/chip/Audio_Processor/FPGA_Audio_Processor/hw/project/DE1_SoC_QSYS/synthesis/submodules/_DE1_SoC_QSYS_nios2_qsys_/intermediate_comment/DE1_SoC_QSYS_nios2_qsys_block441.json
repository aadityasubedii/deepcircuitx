    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a constant value of zero to a signal named `xbrk2_toff_hit`. This is a simple operation achieved using the `assign` keyword in Verilog. The output signal `xbrk2_toff_hit` will constantly hold the value zero regardless of any changes in the system or environment."
