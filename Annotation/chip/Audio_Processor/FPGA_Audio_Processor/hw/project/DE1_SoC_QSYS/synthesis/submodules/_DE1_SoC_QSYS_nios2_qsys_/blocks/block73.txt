Comment: 
This block of code serves as a sequential logic circuit for controlling the arithmetic right shift operation. With each positive edge of the clock or a negative edge of the reset, the circuit checks if a reset has been signalled. If so, it sets the "R_ctrl_shift_right_arith" register to 0. However, if there's no reset signal and the right shift operation is enabled (R_en is high), the value of the next state "R_ctrl_shift_right_arith_nxt" is stored in the "R_ctrl_shift_right_arith" register.
