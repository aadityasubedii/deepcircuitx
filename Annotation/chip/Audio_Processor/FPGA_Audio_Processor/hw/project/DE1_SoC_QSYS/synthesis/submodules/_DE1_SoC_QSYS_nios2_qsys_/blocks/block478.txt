Comment: 
The given line of code defines a latch named `dbrk_hit0_latch` and assigns it a default value of `0`. This behaviour is achieved through the use of the `assign` keyword, which in Verilog RTL is used to create continuous assignments, or connections between wires. The literal `1'b0` implies that the value assigned is a 1-bit binary number `0`. The latch serves as a basic storage element which may be crucial in circuit design.
