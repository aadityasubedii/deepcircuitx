    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog handles logic operation selection in a digital circuit's data path. It utilizes a ternary operator to decide the logic operation to be executed, based on the condition `D_ctrl_alu_force_xor`. If this condition is true, meaning that the force XOR operation is instructed, the block outputs a binary '11' to `D_logic_op`, forcing the system to perform a bitwise XOR operation. Otherwise, the original raw logic operation is maintained."
