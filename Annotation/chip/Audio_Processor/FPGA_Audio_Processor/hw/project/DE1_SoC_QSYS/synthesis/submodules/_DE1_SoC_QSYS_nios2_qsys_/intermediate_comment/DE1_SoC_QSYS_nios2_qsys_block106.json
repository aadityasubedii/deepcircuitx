    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is designed to manage register updates for a custom multi-controller. On every positive edge of clock signal or every negative edge of reset signal, the block is activated. If a negative reset signal is present, the controller is reset by setting the `R_ctrl_custom_multi` register to 0. However, if the reset signal is not present and the enable signal `R_en` is asserted, the block updates the value of `R_ctrl_custom_multi` with the next state `R_ctrl_custom_multi_nxt`."
