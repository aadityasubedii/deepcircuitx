Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code assigns a comparison operation to 'D_compare_op'. The conditional statement uses the binary operator '?' to make a selection between 'D_iw_opx' or 'D_iw_op' based on the value of 'D_op_opx'. Specifically, if 'D_op_opx' is true, the bits 3 through 4 of 'D_iw_opx' are assigned to 'D_compare_op'. Otherwise, the bits 3 through 4 of 'D_iw_op' are assigned to 'D_compare_op'.
