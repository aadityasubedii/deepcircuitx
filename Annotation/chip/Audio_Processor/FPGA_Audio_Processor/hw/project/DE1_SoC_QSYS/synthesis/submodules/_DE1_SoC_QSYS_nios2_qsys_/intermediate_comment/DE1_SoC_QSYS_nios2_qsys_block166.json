    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a synchronous reset mechanism in a digital circuit design. Upon the positive edge of the clock signal (clk) or the negative edge of the reset signal (reset_n), the block executes. If 'reset_n' is '0', the data write operation is reset to '0' which can be seen as clearing or initializing the value. However, if the 'reset_n' is not '0', the data write operation (`d_writedata`) takes the data from `E_st_data`. This design allows for a controlled reset of the write data and flexibility in directing data output flow based on the control signal `reset_n`."
