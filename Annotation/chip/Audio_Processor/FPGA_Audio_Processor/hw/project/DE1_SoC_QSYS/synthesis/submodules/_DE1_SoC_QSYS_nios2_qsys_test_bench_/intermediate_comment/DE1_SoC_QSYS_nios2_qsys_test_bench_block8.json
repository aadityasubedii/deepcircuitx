    "block_comment": "This block of code is for error checking in a synchronous reset system. The specific functionality that it provides is checking the value of d_byteenable signal and stopping the system if any ambiguous value, denoted by 'x', is detected. When a positive edge of the clock or a negative edge of the reset_n signal is detected, it checks whether the reset_n flag is set to 0 or not. If not, it then checks the d_write signal. If it's high, it checks for the value of d_byteenable and produces an error message if it has any unresolvable values. So it's mainly a safety code snippet for the system to handle unstable states."
