    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code determines when a shift or rotation operation is complete. It does this by comparing the `E_shift_rot_cnt` variable to zero and ensuring `E_new_inst` is not true, thus indicating that there are no new instructions pending. When both these conditions are met, the `E_shift_rot_done` signal is asserted, indicating that the operation has completed successfully."
