As part of its operation, it includes an instantiation of the altera_pll component with particular parameters related to clock functionality and frequency. The module has a 'rst' input signal used to reset the PLL and 'refclk' which serves as the reference clock input for the PLL. \n\n`outclk_0` and `outclk_1` are generated by the PLL from the reference clock and are output signals. 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1' output clock signals which operate at 143MHz frequency; the 'locked' output signal represents the lock status of the PLL, indicating when the PLL's output frequency and phase are stable and match the expected values. \n\nThere aren't any explicitly declared internal signals in the code; however, internally, the 'fboutclk' and 'fbclk' are connected within the altera_pll component. 'fboutclk' is typically a feedback output clock to maintain the lock of the PLL with the original input, while 'fbclk' represents the feedback input clock - which is statically defined in the module as '1'b0'. \n\nThe code comprises mainly of the definition of the module inputs and outputs, the instantiation of the altera_pll component, and the connection of these signals to the altera_pll instance. The main functionality is encapsulated within the altera_pll block; this is where the output frequencies and phases, operation mode, and other parameters are determined based on the set configurations.",

Its main function is to generate outputs (outclk_0, outclk_1) with specific frequencies (143.000000 MHz) based on the input reference clock (refclk) and reset signals (rst). Additionally, it generates a locked signal indicating the lock status of the PLL. The locked signal generally indicates if the PLL is operating in phase with the input clock. The PLL here is operating in \"normal\" mode and it has a reference clock frequency set to 50.0 MHz. The PLL doesn't have a fractional multiplier, as the fractional_vco_multiplier is set to \"false\"."

Explanation: This input is used to reset the PLL. Upon receiving a reset signal, the PLL will restart its operation.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. outclk_0: One of the PLL output clock signals. Explanation: This output clock signal is generated by the PLL based on the reference clock and parameters set within the module. The frequency for this clock is set to 143.000000 MHz in the module.\n2. outclk_1: Another PLL output clock signal. Explanation: This is another output clock signal, its frequency is also set to 143.000000 MHz. It might have different phase from the outclk_0 depending on phase configuration.\n3. locked: This is a boolean status signal. Explanation: The signal 'locked' is an output signal which indicates whether the PLL is locked or not. If the PLL is locked, it signifies that the output frequency and phase are stable and are as expected.
