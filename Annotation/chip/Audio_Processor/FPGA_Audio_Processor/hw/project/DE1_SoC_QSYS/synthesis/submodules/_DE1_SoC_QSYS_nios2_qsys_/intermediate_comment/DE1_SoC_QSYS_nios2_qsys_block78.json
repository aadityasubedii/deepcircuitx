    "block_comment": "This line of code performs a logical shift operation. Specifically, it uses the \"assign\" keyword to bind D_ctrl_shift_logical to the result of bitwise 'OR' of D_op_slli, D_op_sll, D_op_srli, and D_op_srl. These four registers individually store the flags for Shift left logical immediate, Shift left logical, Shift right logical immediate and Shift right logical operations respectively."
