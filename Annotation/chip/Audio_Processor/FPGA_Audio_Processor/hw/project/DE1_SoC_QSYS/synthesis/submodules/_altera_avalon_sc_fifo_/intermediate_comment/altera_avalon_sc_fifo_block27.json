    "block_comment": "This block of code utilizes a conditional generate statement. The generate statement wraps a conditional if-statement, which evaluates if the parameter `EMPTY_LATENCY` equals to '3'. If this condition is met, the named \"gen_blk15\" block of implementation goes into effect. Hence, the result of this block of code highly depends on the parameter value which has been set for `EMPTY_LATENCY` beforehand."
