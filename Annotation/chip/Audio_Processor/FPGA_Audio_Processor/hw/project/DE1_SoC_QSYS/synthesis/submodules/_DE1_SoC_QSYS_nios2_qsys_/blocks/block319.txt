Comment: 
This block of code represents a synchronous block for a FIFO module. The activity in the block is triggered by either a positive edge of the clock or a negative edge of the active low reset. In the case of a reset (reset_n = 0), the FIFO, represented by fifo_0, is cleared (set to 0). Otherwise, if the FIFO enable signal (fifo_0_enable) is high, the output of the MUX (fifo_0_mux) is assigned to the FIFO.
