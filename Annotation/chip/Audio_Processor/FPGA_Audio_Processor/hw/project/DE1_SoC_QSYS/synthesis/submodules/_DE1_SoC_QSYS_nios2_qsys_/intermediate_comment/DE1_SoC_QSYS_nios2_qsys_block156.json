    "block_comment": "This block assigns a future value to av_ld_byte1_data. If av_ld_rshift8 is true, the current av_ld_byte2_data is selected for the next cycle. If av_ld_rshift8 is false and av_ld_extend is true, 8 bits of av_fill_bit are concatenated and assigned. If both control signals are false, a slice from 15th bit to 8th bit of d_readdata is directed for the future cycle. This conditional assignment serves as type of a mux based on control signal values."
