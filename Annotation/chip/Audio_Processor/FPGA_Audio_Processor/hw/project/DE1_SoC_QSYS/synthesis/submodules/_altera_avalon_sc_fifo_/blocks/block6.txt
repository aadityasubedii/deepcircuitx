Comment: 
This Verilog block serves as a packet counter and status flag manager in a data packets processing system. On each clock cycle or system reset, it updates the packet count, checks if a packet process has started, and sets several status flags based on certain conditions. Primarily, it increases or decreases the packet count (`pkt_cnt`) based on packet arrival (`in_pkt_eop_arrive`) and exit (`out_pkt_leave`), as well as error flags (`drop_on_error`). Additionally, it manages flags for the start of packet (`pkt_has_started`), leaving of packet's start of packet (`sop_has_left_fifo`), buffer size (`fifo_too_small_r`), buffer fill level compared to a certain threshold (`fifo_fill_level_lt_cut_through_threshold`), and a few other packet count related flags. On reset, it reinitializes these values to their default state.
