This block of code introduces a synchronous reset to the fifo_12 register, while also enabling updates to it. The register, fifo_12, is set to zero when a negative edge-triggered reset signal, reset_n, is detected i.e., when reset_n equals to zero. In the absence of reset_n, if fifo_12_enable is high (set to 1), the value of the register fifo_12 is updated with the value from fifo_12_mux on the positive edge of the clock signal, clk.
