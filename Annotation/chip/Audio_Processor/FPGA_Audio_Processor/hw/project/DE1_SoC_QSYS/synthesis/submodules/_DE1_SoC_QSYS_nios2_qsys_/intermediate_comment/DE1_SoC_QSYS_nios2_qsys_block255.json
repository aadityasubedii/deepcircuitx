    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a synchronous register with asynchronous reset. During a positive edge of the clock or when negative reset_n signal occurs, it checks if the reset_n is zero \u2014 which if yes, trc_jtag_addr is reset to zero (asynchronous reset). Else, if any of the conditions including take_action_tracemem_a, take_no_action_tracemem_a, or take_action_tracemem_b are true, then the trc_jtag_addr is either assigned the value of jdo from bit 19 to 35 or incremented by 1 based on whether take_action_tracemem_a is true or not. These conditions perform specific actions that rely on the specific hardware implementation details this code is written for."
