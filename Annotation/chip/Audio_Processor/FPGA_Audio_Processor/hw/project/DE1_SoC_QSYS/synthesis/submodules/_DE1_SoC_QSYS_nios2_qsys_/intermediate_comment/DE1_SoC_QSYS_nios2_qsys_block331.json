    "block_comment": "This block generates a boolean 'atm_valid' signal based on a bitwise OR (denoted by '|') and AND ('&') operations on specific bit slices of 'atm' and 'trc_this' signals respectively. More specifically, all the bits from 32nd to 35th position of the 'atm' signal are OR'd together, and then AND'd with the 'trc_this' signal to determine the boolean output of 'atm_valid'."
