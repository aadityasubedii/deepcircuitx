    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2 module is a 32-bit single-port synchronous RAM, storing 32,000 words, implemented using Altera's \"altsyncram\" megafunction. The module uses input signals, such as address, byteenable, chipselect, write, and others to control various operations. Internally, it generates wren (write enable) and clocken0 (clock enable) signals for efficient handling of read/write operations. Output is sent out via readdata port corresponding to provided address. It provides power saving option by 'freeze' signal, and reset functionality using 'reset' and 'reset_req'."
