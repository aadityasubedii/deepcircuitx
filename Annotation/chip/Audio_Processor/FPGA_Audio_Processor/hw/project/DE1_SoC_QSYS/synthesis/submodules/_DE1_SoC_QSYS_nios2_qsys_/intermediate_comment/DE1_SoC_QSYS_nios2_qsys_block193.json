    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a basic arithmetic operation. It decides between addition and subtraction of two operands, `E_arith_src1` and `E_arith_src2`, based on the value of the boolean signal `E_alu_sub`. If `E_alu_sub` is high, subtraction is performed, otherwise, the operations result in the addition of the two operands."
