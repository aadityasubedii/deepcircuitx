This code block sets the value of the 'input_ge3' signal. It utilizes the bitwise AND reduction operator (&), which sequentially applies the AND operator to each bit of 'input_tm_cnt'. If all bits of 'input_tm_cnt' are high (i.e., 1), the result is 1; otherwise, it's 0. Consequently, 'input_ge3' is assigned this result. This operation is synthesized into a large AND gate when the hardware implementation occurs.
