    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the write and read pointers of a storage unit in a synchronous system. The block responds to either the positive edge of a clock signal or the positive edge of a reset signal. When the reset signal is asserted, it resets both the write and read pointers to zero. When the block responds to the rising edge of the clock and no reset is asserted, the write pointer 'wr_ptr' and read pointer 'rd_ptr' values are updated to 'next_wr_ptr' and 'next_rd_ptr' respectively, which are presumably updated elsewhere in the code. This enables regular updating of these pointers in synchronization with the system clock."
