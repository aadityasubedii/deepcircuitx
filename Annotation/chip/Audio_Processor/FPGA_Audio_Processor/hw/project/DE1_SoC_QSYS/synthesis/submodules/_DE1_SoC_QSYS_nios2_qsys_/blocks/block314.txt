Comment: 
The block of code's function is to enable the second FIFO queue under certain conditions. These conditions include when the write pointer of the FIFO queue is at the position 2 and there is a minimum of one input or when there are two or more free spaces ("ge2_free") and the next (plus 1) write pointer position is 2 with at least two inputs. Another case of activation is when there are three or more free spaces ("ge3_free") and the next to next (plus 2) write pointer position is 2 with minimum of three inputs.
