    "block_comment": "This block assigns the `take_no_action_break_c` variable based on multiple conditions. When `enable_action_strobe` is active, and the `ir` variable equals `2'b10`, and bit 36 and 35 of `jdo` are set while bit 37 is not set, then `take_no_action_break_c` will be issued. The implementation leverages Bit-wise logical operations to handle the conditions."
