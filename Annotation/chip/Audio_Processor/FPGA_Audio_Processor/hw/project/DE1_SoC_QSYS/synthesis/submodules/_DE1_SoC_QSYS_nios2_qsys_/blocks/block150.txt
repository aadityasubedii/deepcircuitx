This code block assigns the value for the signal `av_fill_bit`. The signal `av_fill_bit` is computed as the logical AND operation between `av_sign_bit` and `R_ctrl_ld_signed`. This means the `av_fill_bit` will be set to true only when both `av_sign_bit` and `R_ctrl_ld_signed` are true, effectively incorporating both conditions in its value definition.
