    "block_comment": "The logic block is utilized for determining whether a branch operation is taken. It employs bitwise AND operation on 'R_ctrl_br' and 'W_cmp_result' signals which are presumably control signal indicating if a branch instruction is present and result of the branch condition comparison, respectively. Hence, the 'W_br_taken' signal will be high only if a branch instruction is there and the branch condition is met."
