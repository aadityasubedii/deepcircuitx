The block generates an enable signal for the 11th FIFO buffer. The enable signal is assigned based on a logical OR of three conditions: 1) The write pointer is currently pointing to the 11th position and there is at least one input available, 2) There's a second available input and the next expected write pointer location is at the 11th position, and, 3) There's a third available input and the second next expected write pointer location is at the 11th position. Each condition considers available inputs and write pointer positions to prevent buffer overflow and efficiently utilize memory space.
