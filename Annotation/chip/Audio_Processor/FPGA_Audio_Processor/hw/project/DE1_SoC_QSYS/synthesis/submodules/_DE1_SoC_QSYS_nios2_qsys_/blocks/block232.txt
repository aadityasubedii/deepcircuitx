Comment: 
This block assigns the output data signal 'i_address' with the concatenation of input data 'F_pc' and a 2-bit binary number '00'. The purpose is to reformat the 'F_pc' into a bit vector that fits the size of 'i_address', enabling seamless memory address flow. In the implementation, the assignment operation is non-blocking, ensuring a continual flow of data within the system, and the concatenate feature of Verilog is used for the bit extension process.
