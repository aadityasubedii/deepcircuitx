This block of Verilog code is responsible for resetting and updating the `E_xbrk_trigout` output signal. A negative-edge triggered asynchronous reset is implemented: when `reset_n` signal is low (`0`), this immediately resets the `E_xbrk_trigout` signal to `0`. After the reset phase, upon each positive-edge of the `clk` and if the `E_cpu_addr_en` signal is high, `E_xbrk_trigout` is updated with the value of `xbrk_tout_hit`, making a synchronous operation which updates the output on the rising edge of the clock.
