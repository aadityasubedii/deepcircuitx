    "block_comment": "This block of code simply assigns a constant value to a signal. It sets the signal `dbrk1_traceoff` to a constant boolean value '0' or low. This indicates that the \"traceoff\" functionality for debugger breakpoint 1 is turned off. Thus, the block is used to control the debugging process of the system."
