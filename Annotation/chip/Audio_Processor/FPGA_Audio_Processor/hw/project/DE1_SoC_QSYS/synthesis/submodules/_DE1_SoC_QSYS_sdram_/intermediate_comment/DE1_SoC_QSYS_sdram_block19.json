    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for multiplexing two input data streams, `entry_0` and `entry_1`, to a single output, `rd_data`, based on the value of `rd_address`. This block uses an 'always' block in Verilog to continuously monitor changes in `entry_0`, `entry_1`, or `rd_address`. Inside the 'always' block, a 'case' statement is used to select the input stream mapped to the `rd_address` value and assigns it to `rd_data`. When `rd_address` is 0, `rd_data` gets the value of `entry_0`. When `rd_address` is 1, `rd_data` gets the value of `entry_1`."
