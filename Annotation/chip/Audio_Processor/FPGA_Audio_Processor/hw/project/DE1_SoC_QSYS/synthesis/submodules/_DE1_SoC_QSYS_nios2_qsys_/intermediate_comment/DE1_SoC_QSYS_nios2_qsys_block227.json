    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic module intended to control a wait signal based on certain conditions. The module is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of the reset signal. If reset is active (low), the 'wait_for_one_post_bret_inst' signal is reset (set to 0). In the non-reset case, it employs conditional expressions to set or clear 'wait_for_one_post_bret_inst'. Specifically, if hardware break is not enabled and single step mode is active, it sets the wait signal. Otherwise, if 'F_valid' is true or single step mode is inactive, it clears the wait signal. In other scenarios, it maintains the current state of the wait signal.\n"
