    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the signal 'D_valid'. This control is implemented using a clock-driven sequential block which is sensitive to the rising edge of 'clk' and the falling edge of 'reset_n'. If 'reset_n' is low, 'D_valid' is reset to 0. Otherwise, 'D_valid' will take on the value of 'F_valid'."
