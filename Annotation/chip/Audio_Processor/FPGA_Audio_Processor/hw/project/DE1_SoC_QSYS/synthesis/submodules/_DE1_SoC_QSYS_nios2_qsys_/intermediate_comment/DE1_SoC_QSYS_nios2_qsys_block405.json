    "block_comment": "This line of code represents a multiplexer (mux) in hardware design. It is used to choose the data (`dbrk_data`) to be sent based on if there is a write operation (`cpu_d_write`). If `cpu_d_write` is true, `dbrk_data` is assigned the value of `cpu_d_writedata` (write data); otherwise, `dbrk_data` gets the value of `cpu_d_readdata` (read data). This methodology works as an effective mechanism to selectively decide the source of `dbrk_data`."
