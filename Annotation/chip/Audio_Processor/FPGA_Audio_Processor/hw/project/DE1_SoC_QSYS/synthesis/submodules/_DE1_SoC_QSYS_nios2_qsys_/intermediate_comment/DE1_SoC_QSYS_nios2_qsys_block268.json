    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a synchronous reset FIFO buffer of depth 15. Operating on the rising edge of the system clock or the falling edge of a reset signal, it resets the FIFO if 'reset_n' is low, and under normal operation (with the reset signal high and 'fifo_15_enable' enabled), it pushes incoming data 'fifo_15_mux' into the FIFO buffer."
