    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code implements a logical OR operation. This block assigns the result of the logical OR operation between the variables 'D_op_crst' and 'D_op_rsvx63' to the variable 'D_ctrl_crst'. The variable 'D_ctrl_crst' is updated every time the signals 'D_op_crst' or 'D_op_rsvx63' changes. This is achieved by the 'assign' statement that continuously drives the left-hand side ('D_ctrl_crst') with the value of the right-hand side expression ('D_op_crst|D_op_rsvx63')."
