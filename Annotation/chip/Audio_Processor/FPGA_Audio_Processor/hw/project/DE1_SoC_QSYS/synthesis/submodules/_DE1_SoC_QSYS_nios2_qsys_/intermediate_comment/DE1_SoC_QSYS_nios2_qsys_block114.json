    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a synchronous D flip-flop with asynchronous reset. The operation of the flip-flop is controlled by two signals: the positive edge of the clock signal ('clk') and the negative edge of the reset signal ('reset_n'). If the reset signal is active (i.e., when `reset_n == 0`), the 'd_write' output is reset to zero immediately. Otherwise, on each rising edge of the clock, the flip-flop updates its current state and sets 'd_write' with the next state value from 'd_write_nxt'.\n"
