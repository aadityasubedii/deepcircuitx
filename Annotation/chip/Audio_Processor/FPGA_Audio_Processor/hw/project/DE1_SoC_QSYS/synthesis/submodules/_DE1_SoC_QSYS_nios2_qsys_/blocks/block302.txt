Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls the enable signal for the sixth FIFO buffer. The enable signal is turned on if the FIFO write pointer is at position 6 and there is at least one input present, or when the second or third stage is free and the write pointer for the next one or two positions is at 6, with at least two or three inputs present, respectively.
