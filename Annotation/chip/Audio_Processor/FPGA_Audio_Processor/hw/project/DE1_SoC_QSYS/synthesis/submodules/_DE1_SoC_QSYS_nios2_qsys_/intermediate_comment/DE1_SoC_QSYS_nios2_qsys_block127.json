    "block_comment": "This block assigns a write control status. This is achieved by performing a bitwise AND operation between R_ctrl_wrctl_inst and a comparison of D_iw_control_regnum being equal to \"3'd0\". The result of this operation is used to update the E_wrctl_status. The block, thus, effectively checks if the correct control register component is targeted for write operations."
