Comment: 
This block of code handles data and error signal assignments for an interface using conditional logic based on the channel width. If the channel width is greater than '0', it takes a combination of packet signals, data, and channel information coming from the input and assigns them to an input payload. The output payload then gets deconstructed into its constituent components: packet signals, data, and channel information. Otherwise, when no specific channel width is described, it simply assigns the input channel to the output channel, and handles input and output payloads with packet signals and data only.
