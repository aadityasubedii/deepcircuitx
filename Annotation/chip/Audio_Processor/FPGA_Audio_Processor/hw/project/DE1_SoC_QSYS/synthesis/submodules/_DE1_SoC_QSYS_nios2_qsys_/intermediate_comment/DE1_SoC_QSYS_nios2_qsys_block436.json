    "block_comment": "The block's function is to continuously set the signal `xbrk3_ton_hit` to zero. This is achieved through the use of the `assign` statement in Verilog, which is an example of a continuous assignment. Continuous assignment means the right-hand side expression is evaluated and assigned to the left-hand side every time there's a change in any variable in the right-hand side. In this case, as there are no variables in the right-hand side, the variable `xbrk3_ton_hit` is always zero unless the module is reset or some other process overrides this assignment."
