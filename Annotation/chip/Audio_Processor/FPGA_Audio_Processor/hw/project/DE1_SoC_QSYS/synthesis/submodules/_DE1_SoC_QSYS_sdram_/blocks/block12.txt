This block of code is responsible for managing the 'za_cannotrefresh' signal in synchronization with the system clock. It initializes this signal to a known state when a negative edge reset occurs and updates it based on the conditions of the 'refresh_counter' and 'refresh_request' signals when the system clock strikes a positive edge. Specifically, when the negative edge reset (reset_n) is equal to 0, it sets 'za_cannotrefresh' signal back to 0. Otherwise, this block sets 'za_cannotrefresh' to true only when 'refresh_counter' equals 0 and 'refresh_request' is asserted during the positive clock edge.
