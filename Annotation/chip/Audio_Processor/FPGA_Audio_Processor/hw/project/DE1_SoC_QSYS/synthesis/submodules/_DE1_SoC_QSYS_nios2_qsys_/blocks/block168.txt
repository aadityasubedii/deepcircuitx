Comment: 
This block of code is used to assign a value to the `av_ld_getting_data` signal. The assignment operation is based on a logical AND operation (`&`) applied to a `d_read` signal and the negation of the `d_waitrequest` signal. When `d_read` is high (1 or 'true') and the `d_waitrequest` is not asserted (0 or 'false'), `av_ld_getting_data` signal will be 'true', indicating that the system is in a state where it's loading data.
