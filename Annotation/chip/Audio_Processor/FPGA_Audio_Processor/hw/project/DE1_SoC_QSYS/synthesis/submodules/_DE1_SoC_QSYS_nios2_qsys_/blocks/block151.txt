Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is essentially a conditional bitwise assignment. It assigns the most significant bit (bit 7) of either `av_ld_byte1_data` or `av_ld_byte0_data` to `av_sign_bit` depending on the Boolean status of `D_mem16`. Specifically, if `D_mem16` is true, `av_sign_bit` is assigned with the MSB of `av_ld_byte1_data`. If `D_mem16` is false, the MSB of `av_ld_byte0_data` is selected instead.
