    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code defines a synchronous system reset and the status update of the 'readyfordata' control signal. The system commences upon either the rising edge of the clock (clk) or the falling edge of the reset signal (rst_n). When the reset is active low (rst_n == 0), the 'readyfordata' signal is made '0', indicating that the system is not ready to accept new data. In the absence of a system reset, 'readyfordata' takes the negated value of 'fifo_FF', a flip-flop which may control whether the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer is full. If 'fifo_FF' is high indicating a full buffer, 'readyfordata' becomes low (not ready), and vice versa."
