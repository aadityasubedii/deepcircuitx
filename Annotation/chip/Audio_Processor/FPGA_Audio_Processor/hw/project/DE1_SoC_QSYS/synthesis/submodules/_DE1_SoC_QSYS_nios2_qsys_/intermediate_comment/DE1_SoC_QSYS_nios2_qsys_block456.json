    "block_comment": "This block of code connects the enable signal for the CPU address (`E_cpu_addr_en`) to the validation signal (`E_valid`). Whenever `E_valid` undergoes a change, the enable signal for CPU address will also change correspondingly. This code works by assigning the same logical state of `E_valid` (which can be either on or off, represented by logic 1 or 0 in Verilog) to `E_cpu_addr_en`. This enables synchronization between validation and CPU addressing. Hence, the CPU address is enabled when valid data is present."
