    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is a conditional check for a FIFO fill level. If the 'USE_ALMOST_FULL_IF' flag is set, it calculates whether the FIFO fill level is equal to or higher than the 'almost_full_threshold'. If this condition is met, 'almost_full_data' is assigned the value of this boolean expression result. If 'USE_ALMOST_FULL_IF' is not set, 'almost_full_data' is simply assigned the value 0. The 'generate if-else' construct used here is to allow this flexible assignment based on a static parameter (USE_ALMOST_FULL_IF) during synthesis of the hardware design."
