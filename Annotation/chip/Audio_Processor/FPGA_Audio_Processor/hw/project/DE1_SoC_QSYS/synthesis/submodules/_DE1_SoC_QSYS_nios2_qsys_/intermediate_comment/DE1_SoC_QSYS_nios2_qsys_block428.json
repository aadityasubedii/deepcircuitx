    "block_comment": "The block assigns the boolean OR (|) value of four other signals (xbrk0_tout_hit, xbrk1_tout_hit, xbrk2_tout_hit, xbrk3_tout_hit) to the signal xbrk_tout_hit. If any or all of those four signals are true (1), the xbrk_tout_hit signal becomes true. This net assignment is made continuously based on the changes of xbrk[0:3]_tout_hit signals."
