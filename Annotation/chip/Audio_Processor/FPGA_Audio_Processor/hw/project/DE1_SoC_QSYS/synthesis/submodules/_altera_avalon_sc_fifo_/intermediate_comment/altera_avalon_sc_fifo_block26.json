    "block_comment": "The Verilog block assigns initial/reset values to 'out_valid' and 'out_payload' in case of a reset signal, else updates 'out_valid' and 'out_payload' based on 'internal_out_ready', 'internal_out_valid', and 'ok_to_forward' signals. The block implementation is synchronous and will consequently only execute updates on the 'posedge' of the clock or reset signals. If the reset signal is high, 'out_valid' and 'out_payload' are cleared to 0. In absence of reset, if 'internal_out_ready' signal is high, 'out_valid' is assigned the bitwise AND of 'internal_out_valid' and 'ok_to_forward' while 'out_payload' gets assigned the value of 'internal_out_payload'."
