Comment: 
This code block is a synchronous flip-flop with async reset functionality in a FPGA or ASIC design. It is triggered on the positive edge of the clock, or the negative edge of reset. The flip-flop is reset when 'reset_n' is negated and the register 'oci_single_step_mode' is driven to '0'. Alternatively, when 'reset_n' is high and the 'take_action_ocireg' signal is true, the value of the 'ocireg_sstep' signal is stored in the 'oci_single_step_mode' flip flop on the next clock cycle.
