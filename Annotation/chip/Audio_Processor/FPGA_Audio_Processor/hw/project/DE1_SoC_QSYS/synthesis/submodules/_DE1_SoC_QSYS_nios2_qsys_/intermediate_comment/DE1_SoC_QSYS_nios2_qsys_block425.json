    "block_comment": "This block of code describes the operation of a synchronous flip-flop with a reset and set based on different conditions. When the reset_n signal goes low, it will reset the xbrk_break to 0. However, if the reset_n is not active and the E_cpu_addr_en signal is high at the rising edge of the clock signal, then xbrk_break is assigned the current value of xbrk_break_hit. This implementation utilizes Verilog's always block features to capture digital electronics' sequential logic behavior."
