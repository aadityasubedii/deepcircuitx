    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a memory-mapped interconnect fabric for a SoC design, connecting multiple masters and slaves. It uses a network of demultiplexers, multiplexers, routers, and width adapters to handle address decoding, data routing, and protocol conversion between components. The interconnect supports various interfaces, manages burst transactions, and ensures proper arbitration and data transfer across different bus widths and protocols."
