    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog pertains to the logic assignment operation of the whole design. The purpose of this block is to define the value of the register 'R_ctrl_custom_multi_nxt' for the upcoming clock cycle. The way it accomplishes this goal is by assigning the value of signal 'D_ctrl_custom_multi' to the register 'R_ctrl_custom_multi_nxt'. Meaning, whatever the value 'D_ctrl_custom_multi' holds in the present will be assigned to 'R_ctrl_custom_multi_nxt' in the subsequent clock cycle."
