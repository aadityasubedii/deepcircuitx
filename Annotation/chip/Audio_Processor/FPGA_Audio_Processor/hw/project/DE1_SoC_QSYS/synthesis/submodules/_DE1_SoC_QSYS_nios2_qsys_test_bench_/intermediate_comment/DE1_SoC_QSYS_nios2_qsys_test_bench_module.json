    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a testbench for the Nios II processor in the DE1-SoC QSYS system. It monitors and verifies processor signals, including instruction decoding, data operations, and register accesses. The module decodes instructions using wire declarations, checks for signal integrity, and filters load data to handle 'x' values. It uses numerous input ports for processor signals and two output ports for filtered data and test completion status."
