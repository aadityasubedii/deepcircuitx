Comment: 
This block of code controls the enabling of a FIFO ('fifo_4_enable'). The FIFO is enabled under three conditions: When the write pointer of the FIFO ('fifo_wrptr') is 4 and there's at least one input ('input_ge1'); or when there are at least two free spaces ('ge2_free') and the write pointer incremented by one ('fifo_wrptr_plus1') equals 4 and there are at least two inputs ('input_ge2'); or when there are at least three free spaces ('ge3_free') and the write pointer incremented by two ('fifo_wrptr_plus2') equals 4 and there are at least three inputs ('input_ge3').
