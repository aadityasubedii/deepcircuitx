    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous reset signal generator. It functions by utilizing a global clock clk to generate a chain of synchronized reset signals. When the least significant bit of the variable 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain' is detected as high during the rising edge of the clock 'clk', the chain of sync reset signals 'r_sync_rst_chain' is fully asserted to high ('1') for the length of 'ASSERTION_CHAIN_LENGTH'. Otherwise, a shift operation is performed which extends the propagated reset signal through the chain by setting the most significant bit to low ('0') and shifting the remaining bits of 'r_sync_rst_chain' to the right."
