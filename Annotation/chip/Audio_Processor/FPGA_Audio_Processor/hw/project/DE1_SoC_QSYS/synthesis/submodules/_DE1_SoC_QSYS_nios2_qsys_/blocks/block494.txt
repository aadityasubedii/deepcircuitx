[Function of the block] This Verilog code block manages the control flow for reading and writing data to memory using the JTAG protocol. It regulates the access to the JTAG register for different scenarios. 

[Implementation details of the block] The block's behavior is determined by the states of control signals like "jrst_n", "take_no_action_ocimem_a", "take_action_ocimem_a", "take_action_ocimem_b", "write", and "read". When a reset is signaled, it clears the read/write indicators and sets the waitrequest and avalon_ociram_readdata_ready flags to their default states. Without a reset, it acts on further control inputs and adjusts different variables accordingly. It also handles the memory access request and availability of data, contingent on various cases and flag states.
