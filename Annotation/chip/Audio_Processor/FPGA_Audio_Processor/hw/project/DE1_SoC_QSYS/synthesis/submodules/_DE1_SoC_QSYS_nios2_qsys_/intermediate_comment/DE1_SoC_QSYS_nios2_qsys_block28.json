    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a register (`R_ctrl_st`) that takes in the next state (`R_ctrl_st_nxt`) under controlled conditions. It operates synchronously with the rising edge of the clock (`clk`), but it asserts asynchronously if the negative reset (`reset_n`) signal is asserted. Detailed behavior wise, upon activation of the reset signal, the register `R_ctrl_st` is reset to `0`. Otherwise, during a rising edge of the given clock while the `R_en` (enable) signal is high, the register `R_ctrl_st` captures and holds the value of `R_ctrl_st_nxt` (next state)."
