    "block_comment": "This code block acts as a data selector for the Write operation of a register file. Based on the value of the 'R_ctrl_ld' signal, it chooses between 'av_ld_data_aligned_filtered' and 'W_wr_data' as its output. When 'R_ctrl_ld' is high, 'av_ld_data_aligned_filtered' gets chosen, otherwise 'W_wr_data' is selected. This mechanism enables the system to conditionally load different data into the register file."
