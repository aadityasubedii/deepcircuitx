Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for managing the validity of a write operation in a context where the system can experience stalls. The action is performed in a synchronous manner, triggered either by a positive edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`) or a negative edge of the reset signal (`negedge reset_n`). When a reset operation is initiated (indicated by `reset_n` equaling 0), it sets the `W_valid` signal low, indicating that no valid write operation is ongoing. If there's no reset, `W_valid` is updated by the logical AND of `E_valid` and the logical negation of `E_stall`, meaning that a write operation is considered valid when `E_valid` is true and the system is not in a state of stall.
