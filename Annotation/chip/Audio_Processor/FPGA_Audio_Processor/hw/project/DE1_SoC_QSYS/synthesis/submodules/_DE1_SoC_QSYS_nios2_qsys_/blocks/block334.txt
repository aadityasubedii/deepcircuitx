Comment: 
This block of code is a module responsible for incrementing the `fifo_cnt_inc` counter based on certain conditions. It responds to a change in either `empty`, `ge2_free`, `ge3_free`, or `input_tm_cnt`. If `empty` is true, it assigns the two least significant bits of `input_tm_cnt` to `fifo_cnt_inc`. If `ge3_free` is true and `input_tm_cnt` equals three, `fifo_cnt_inc` is set to two. If `ge2_free` is true and `input_tm_cnt` is two or more, `fifo_cnt_inc` is set to one. If `input_tm_cnt` is at least one, `fifo_cnt_inc` is set to zero. Finally, if none of these conditions are met, `fifo_cnt_inc` is set to a five-bit value of all ones.
