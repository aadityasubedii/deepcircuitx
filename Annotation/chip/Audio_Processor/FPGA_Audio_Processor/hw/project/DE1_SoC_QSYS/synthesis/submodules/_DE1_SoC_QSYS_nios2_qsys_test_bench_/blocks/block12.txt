Comment: 
This block of code systematically handles resets and writes for a specified register in a test bench system. In case of a negative edge on the 'reset_n' or upon a positive edge on the 'clk' signal, the block gets activated. Initially, it checks if 'reset_n' is zero, but no action is specified if the condition is true. Following that, if the 'W_valid' signal is high, the XOR of 'R_wr_dst_reg' is checked to be 'x', implying a high-impedance state. If this condition returns true, an error message is displayed stating the status of 'R_wr_dst_reg' with the corresponding time in nanoseconds, and the system is stopped, symbolizing critical failure.
