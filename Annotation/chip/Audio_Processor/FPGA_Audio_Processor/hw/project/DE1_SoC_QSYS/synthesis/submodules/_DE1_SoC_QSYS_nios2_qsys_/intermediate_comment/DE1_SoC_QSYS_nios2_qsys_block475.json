    "block_comment": "This block assigns a constant logical 0 value to the identifier dbrk_hit1_latch. This action effectively initializes or resets the dbrk_hit1_latch signal to '0'. Due to the usage of the assign keyword, this operation is continuously performed, ensuring that the value of dbrk_hit1_latch is always '0' in every cycle of the simulation."
