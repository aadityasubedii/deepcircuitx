    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for defining the behavior of the signal 'delayed_unxcounter_is_zeroxx0' according to the state of the 'reset_n' and 'clk_en' signals. On the falling edge of 'reset_n', it instantly sets 'delayed_unxcounter_is_zeroxx0' to 0, effectively initializing it. However, if 'reset_n' is not asserted and 'clk_en' is high at the rising edge of 'clk', the state of 'counter_is_zero' is latched onto 'delayed_unxcounter_is_zeroxx0'. In essence, this block functions as a resettable and clock-enabled latch for the 'counter_is_zero' signal."
