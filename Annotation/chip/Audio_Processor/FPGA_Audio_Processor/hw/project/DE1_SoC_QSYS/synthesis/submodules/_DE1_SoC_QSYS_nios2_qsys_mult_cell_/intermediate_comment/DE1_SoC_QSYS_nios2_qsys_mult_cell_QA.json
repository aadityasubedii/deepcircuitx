The multiplication task is split into two smaller tasks using the components \"the_altmult_add_part_1\" and \"the_altmult_add_part_2\". The first component multiplies the lower half (bits 15 to 0) of the inputs and the second one multiplies the upper half (bits 31 to 16) of the first input by the lower half (bits 15 to 0) of the second input. The upper 16 bits of the final result are obtained by adding the results of these two smaller tasks, and the lower 16 bits are from the result of \"the_altmult_add_part_1\". The multiplication cell operates in synchronization with a clock signal and can be reset using a reset signal."

The reset_n port is used to reset the module to its initial state, for instance, when the system initializes or when instructed to do so by the control logic.\n\nOutput ports: \nA_mul_cell_result: This is a 32-bit output port where the result of the multiplication operation (A_mul_src1 * A_mul_src2) is output by the module.\n\nExplanation: The output port A_mul_cell_result serves to output the result of the multiplication operation performed by the module."
