    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a constant logical zero to the variable 'dbrk0_traceoff'. This means that, regardless of previous state or external conditions, 'dbrk0_traceoff' will always maintain a value of zero. This could be used to turn off or disable a function that 'dbrk0_traceoff' is associated with in the wider system as Verilog treat 0 as logical off."
