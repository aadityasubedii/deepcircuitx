    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a byte count control logic for a FIFO buffer in a synchronous circuit. Upon a positive clock edge, or a negative reset edge, it either resets the byte count and FIFO read demand to zero when a reset signal is activated, or otherwise updates the FIFO read demand based on the previous cycle and adjusts the remaining byte count based on whether there's a read demand or a new input. Specifically, the byte count decreases when a byte is read (fifo_rd is high), and the count resets per the num_bytes value when there's a new input (new_rom is high)."
