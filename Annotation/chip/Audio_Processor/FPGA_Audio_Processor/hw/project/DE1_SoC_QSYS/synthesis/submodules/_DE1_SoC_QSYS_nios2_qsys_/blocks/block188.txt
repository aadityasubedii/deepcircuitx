The given block of code is assigning the value of the 33rd bit of the E_arith_result to the E_lt variable. This block of code is essentially extracting a specific bit from E_arith_result which is a multi-bit signal or variable, and this operation could be used for certain considerations such as determining whether or not an arithmetic operation resulted in a negative number (in a two's complement number representation).
