This Verilog RTL code block is setting a parameter for an Altera standard synchronizer component. Specifically, it is defining the depth of the synchronizer to be 2 by using the defparam keyword. This component is used to synchronize the data across different clock domains and by setting this depth to 2, the synchronizer will have two stages. This is a common setting to avoid metastability issues while transferring data between two clock domains that are not in phase.
