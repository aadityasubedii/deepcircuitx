This block of code assigns the output from the `D_op_rdctl` instance to the `D_ctrl_rdctl_inst` instance. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used to make this assignment, creating a continuous assignment statement. Implementation-wise, this means that any change in the value of `D_op_rdctl` will immediately propagate to `D_ctrl_rdctl_inst`. This net signal assignment is commonly used in RTL design for connecting different modules or components within the system.
