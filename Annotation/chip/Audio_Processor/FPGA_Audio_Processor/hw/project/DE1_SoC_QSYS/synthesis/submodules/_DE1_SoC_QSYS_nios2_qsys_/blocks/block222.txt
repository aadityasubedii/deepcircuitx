This code block handles reset functionality and data update in a flip-flop. The operation of the block happens at the positive edge of the clock (clk) or at the negative edge of the reset (reset_n). If the reset_n signal is low, the data (D_iw) is reset to 0. Alternatively, when the 'F_valid' condition is true, which can be an indication for valid data at the input, the input data (F_iw) is stored into D_iw, syncing it with the clock cycle.
