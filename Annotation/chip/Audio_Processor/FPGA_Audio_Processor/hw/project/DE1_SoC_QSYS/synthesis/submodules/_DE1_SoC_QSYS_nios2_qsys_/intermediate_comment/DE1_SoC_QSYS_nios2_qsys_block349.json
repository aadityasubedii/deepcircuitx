    "block_comment": "The function of this block of Verilog code is to manage the `trc_clear` register, based on certain combinations of provided inputs and signals. The register `trc_clear` is asynchronously reset when `jrst_n` is at a negative edge. If not, in the event of a positive edge of the `clk`, `trc_clear` gets set to the result of the boolean operation between the complement of `trc_enb`, `take_action_tracectrl`, and `jdo[4]`. This allows `trc_clear` to be tailored based on various combinations of `trc_enb`, `take_action_tracectrl`, and `jdo[4]` outputs."
