Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a simple assignment statement. It sets the value of the wire or reg variable `dbrk3_armed` to a 1-bit binary value `0`. The `assign` keyword is used for continuous assignment statements which means the right-hand side is continuously evaluated and the result is assigned to the left-hand side, maintaining the value of `dbrk3_armed` always as `0`.
