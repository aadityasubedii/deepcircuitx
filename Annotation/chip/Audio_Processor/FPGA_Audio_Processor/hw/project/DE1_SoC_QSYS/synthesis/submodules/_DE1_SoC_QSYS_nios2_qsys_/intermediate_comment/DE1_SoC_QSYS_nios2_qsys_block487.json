    "block_comment": "The given block of code is responsible for determining whether a write enable signal (`ociram_wr_en`) should be sent within the context of a system that interacts with an On-Chip RAM. This operation is controlled based on whether there's an access through a JTAG interface or Avalon interface. If the access is from the JTAG interface (`jtag_ram_access` is true), the write enable signal (`ociram_wr_en`) is enabled through `jtag_ram_wr`; if not, it is enabled through `avalon_ram_wr`. This conditional assignment makes the decision based on the prioritizing JTAG access over Avalon access in a shared memory environment."
