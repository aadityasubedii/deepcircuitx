Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key module manages key input interrupts and read-write operations for the DE1-SoC platform using the QSYS system. It mainly uses input ports including 'address', 'chipselect', 'clk', 'in_port', 'reset_n', 'write_n', and 'writedata' and output ports 'irq' (interrupt request) and 'readdata'. Internally, it employs signals such as 'clk_en', 'd1_data_in', 'd2_data_in', 'data_in', 'edge_capture', and 'irq_mask' for tasks such as edge detection, interrupt masking, and key state reading. The module performs its functionality through blocks for signal assignment, read-write operations, and key press edge detection.
