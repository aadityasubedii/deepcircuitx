    "block_comment": "The block of code is a sequential logic design in Verilog responsible for handling FIFO read/write operations and managing associated flags. As per the logic, it samples data at the positive edge of the clock (clk) or at the negative edge of reset (rst_n). The block zeroes all flags and requests on reset. In normal operation, it updates flags such as fifo_AE and fifo_AF based on the FIFO fill status. It also manages read and write requests based on input flags av_chipselect, av_write_n, and av_read_n. Conditional blocks of code ensure that appropriate action (read/write) is taken based on the state of these flags, which represent the address, data, and control lines of the hardware system."
