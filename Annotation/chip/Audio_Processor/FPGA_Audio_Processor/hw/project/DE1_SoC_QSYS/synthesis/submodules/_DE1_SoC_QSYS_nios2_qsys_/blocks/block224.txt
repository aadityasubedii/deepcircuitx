The block assigns incoming read data to the internal signal F_av_iw. This is simply done in this block by using the Verilog 'assign' keyword, which signifies a continuous assignment statement. The right-hand side (RHS), 'i_readdata', is continuously monitored and whenever it changes, the new value is assigned to the left-hand side (LHS) 'F_av_iw'.
