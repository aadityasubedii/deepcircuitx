    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a control signal for an indirect jump instruction in a pipeline control logics module. The control signal, D_ctrl_jmp_indirect, is designed as an OR gate of several different operands such as eret, bret, rsvx17, rsvx25, ret, jmp, rsvx21, and callr, each corresponding to a different jump or return instruction. This approach achieves an efficient way of determining the occurrence of any relevant instruction and thus setting the appropriate control signal."
