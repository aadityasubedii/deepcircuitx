This is a sequential logic block defining when to update the `R_ctrl_ignore_dst` register. It updates based on the clock (positive edge) or reset (negative edge) signals. During a reset (when `reset_n` is 0), it forces `R_ctrl_ignore_dst` to zero, implying it ignores the destination. If not resetting, and if enable (`R_en`) is high, it updates `R_ctrl_ignore_dst` with the value of `R_ctrl_ignore_dst_nxt` at the next positive clock edge.
