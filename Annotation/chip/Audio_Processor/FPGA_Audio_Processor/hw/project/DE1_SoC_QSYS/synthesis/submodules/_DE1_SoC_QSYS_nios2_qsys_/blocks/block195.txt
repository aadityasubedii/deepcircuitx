Comment: 
This block is responsible for the computation of the first source operand for an arithmetic operation. It implements this by performing an XOR operation on the most significant bit (MSB) of 'E_src1' with 'E_invert_arith_src_msb', and concatenates this result with the remaining 30 bits of 'E_src1', creating a 32-bit operand for subsequent arithmetic operations.
