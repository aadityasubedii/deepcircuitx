Comment: 
This block of code is implementing a flip-flop with asynchronous reset in Verilog. The flip-flop is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal `clk` and negative edge of the reset signal `reset_n`. If `reset_n` is low (0), the flip-flop (represented by `E_src1`) gets reset instantly regardless of the clock signal. On every positive edge of the clock signal, if `reset_n` is not low, data is transferred from `R_src1` to `E_src1`.
