    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is implementing edge detection functionality. Specifically, it is detecting the rising edge of a signal in 'd1_data_in'. The 'assign' statement is used to continuously evaluate and assign the result to the variable 'edge_detect'. A bitwise AND operation '&', together with a bitwise NOT operation '~', is performed on 'd1_data_in' and 'd2_data_in', respectively. This operation will output a high signal ('1') when 'd1_data_in' is high and 'd2_data_in' is low, essentially highlighting when 'd1_data_in' transitions from low to high, hence the creation of a rising edge detector."
