Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for generating forwarding control signals based on specific conditions. When conditions stated in the 'if' clause are not met, the signals `ok_to_forward` and `drop_on_error` are unconditionally assigned as true and false, respectively. For the `curr_sop_ptr`, if `ADDR_WIDTH` is less than or equal to 1, it is assigned a single bit false value; otherwise, it is assigned a concatenation of false values of bit-length `ADDR_WIDTH - 1` using the concatenation operator `{}`.
