    "block_comment": "This block is a multiplexer for reading various hardware registers based on the input address. It functions by using the bitwise AND operator with a generated Boolean mask based on the address equality check, only allowing the corresponding register value to pass through when the address matches. This value then participates in a bitwise OR operation to form the final outcome, effectively implementing a many-to-one multiplexer operation in hardware."
