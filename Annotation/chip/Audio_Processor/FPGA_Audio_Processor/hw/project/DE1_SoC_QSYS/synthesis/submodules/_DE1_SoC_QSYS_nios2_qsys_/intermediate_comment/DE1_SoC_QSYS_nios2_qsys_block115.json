    "block_comment": "This block is a hardware breakpoint control circuit in a pipelining structure. The circuit operates on the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of the reset action. The role of the circuit is to hold or flow the pipeline and it is controlled by register transfer level (RTL) conditions. When the reset action is active (reset_n = 0), the circuit forces the pipeline to flow (hbreak_enabled set to 1). In the absence of a reset action, the breakpoint's status is determined by both E_valid signal and the pipelining control signal R_ctrl_break or D_op_bret. Based on these signals, the pipeline could either hold (hbreak_enabled set to 0) or flow (hbreak_enabled remains or set to 1)."
