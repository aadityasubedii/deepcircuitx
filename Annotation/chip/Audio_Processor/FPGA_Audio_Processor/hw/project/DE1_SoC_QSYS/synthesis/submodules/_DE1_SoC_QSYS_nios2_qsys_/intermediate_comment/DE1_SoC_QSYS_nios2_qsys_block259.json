    "block_comment": "This block of code is a flip flop block. It is designed to synchronize logic circuit and data signal processing functions, and plays a crucial role in digital sequential circuits. The flip flop updates its state at every positive edge of the 'clkx2' clock signal or at the negative edge of the 'jrst_n' signal. If 'jrst_n' is 0, the 'x2', 'tr_clk_reg', and 'tr_data_reg' registers get reset to 0. Otherwise, 'x2' is set to the value of 'x1', 'tr_clk_reg' gets the inverse of the 'phase', while 'tr_data_reg' is assigned with a part of the 'tw' logic vector, selected based on the value of 'phase'."
