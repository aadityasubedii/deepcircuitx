Comment: 
This block of code manages buffer status (empty or not) in a circular buffer system. On positive edges of the `clk` or `reset`, the logic takes effect. If the `reset` signal is high, the first buffer element is cleared, indicating the buffer is empty. If not, it checks whether there's a write or read operation happening. For a write operation, the first element of the buffer is marked as full (`mem_used[0]` is 1). In case of a read, first it checks the buffer depth. If it is greater than 1, it cascades the status of the next buffer element to the first one, otherwise indicates the buffer as empty.
