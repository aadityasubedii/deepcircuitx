This code block's purpose is to generate the 'fifo_13_enable' control signal for the 13th index position of the FIFO memory structure (if exists). It ascertains this by evaluating three conditions: the write pointer 'fifo_wrptr' is equal to 13 AND input 'input_ge1' is high OR 'ge2_free' signal is high, the incremented (by one) write pointer matches 13 with an active 'input_ge2' signal OR if the twice incremented write pointer equals 13 with 'ge3_free' signal being high and 'input_ge3' signal being active.
