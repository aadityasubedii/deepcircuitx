    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for handling status register updates under different clock conditions in a synchronous digital system. When a negative reset signal is detected, the status register 'W_bstatus_reg' is reset immediately to zero. On the other hand, on a positive clock edge, if no reset action is taken, the status register is updated with the value of 'W_bstatus_reg_nxt'."
