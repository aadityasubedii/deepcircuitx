    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the behavior of the control exception register. Upon the rising edge of the clock or a falling edge on the reset line, the block checks if a reset has been signaled. If that's true, it sets the `R_ctrl_exception` register to 0, effectively initializing it. In the absence of a reset signal but in the presence of `R_en` (presumably an enable signal), it updates the value of the `R_ctrl_exception` register to equal `R_ctrl_exception_nxt` for the next clock cycle, thereby controlling the exception handling."
