    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for enabling a write operation to the Avalon ram. The write operation is triggered under three conditions: when the 'write' signal is true, the 9th bit of the address is not set, and 'debugaccess' is allowed. This operation is implemented through a bitwise AND operation between 'write', the negation of the 9th address bit, and 'debugaccess'."
