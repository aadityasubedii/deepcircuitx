The given block of code reads an incoming address into a local variable during every change on the 'rdaddress' signal. This happens in an always block, which in Verilog, is used to create register type behavior. The incoming address 'rdaddress' is assigned to the module's internal variable 'read_address' on each change in the input address. This block is, therefore, implemented using sensitivity to the 'rdaddress' signal and assigning it to the 'read_address' variable whenever a change is detected.
