    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code functions as an assignment operation within a digital logic design. The key job of this line is to assign the future state of the signal 'R_ctrl_src2_choose_imm_nxt' based on the current state of the 'D_ctrl_src2_choose_imm' signal. The operation is conducted on every clock cycle due to the 'assign' command used in the code. The '_nxt' extension on the variable name implies that the code represents stateful behavior commonly found in pipelined designs."
