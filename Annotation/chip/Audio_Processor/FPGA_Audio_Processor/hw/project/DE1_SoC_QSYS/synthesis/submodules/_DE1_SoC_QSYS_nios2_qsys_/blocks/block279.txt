Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code primarily manages the output selection for a multiplexer `fifo_11_mux`, based on multiple condition checks related to the write pointer of a FIFO buffer and the validity of certain input signals. The output selection involves various multiplexing decisions based on the `fifo_wrptr`, `fifo_wrptr_plus1`, and conditions of `itm_valid`, `atm_valid`, and `dtm_valid`. The routine includes input handling from three different config sources: the ITM, ATM, and DTM modules. When a particular condition is met, the mux assignment operation outputs the relevant overflow_pending signal. The code also includes safety precaution in the design by adding an extra level of verification with the use of `ge2_free` which makes sure the required resources are available.
