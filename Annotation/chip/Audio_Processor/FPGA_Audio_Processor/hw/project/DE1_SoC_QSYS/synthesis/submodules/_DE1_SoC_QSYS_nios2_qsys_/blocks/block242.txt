Comment: 
This block of code manages the `write` control signal based on the system clock(`clk`), asynchronous reset signal (`jrst_n`) and the `waitrequest` and `write_nxt` signals. Upon a rising edge of the `clk` or falling edge of `jrst_n`, it checks if `jrst_n` is 0 and if true, it forces `write` to be 0, effectively resetting it. If `jrst_n` is not 0, `write` is assigned the value of `write_nxt` when `waitrequest` is not active, otherwise, it retains its current state.
