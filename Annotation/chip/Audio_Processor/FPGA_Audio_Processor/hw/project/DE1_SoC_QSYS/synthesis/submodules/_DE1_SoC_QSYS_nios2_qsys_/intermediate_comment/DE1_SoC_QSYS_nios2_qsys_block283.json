    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the operation of a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory cell, `fifo_10`, in a digital system. When there's a negative edge on the `reset_n` signal (i.e., a reset event), the memory cell is cleared (set to 0). During the positive edge of the system clock (`clk`), if the `fifo_10_enable` is high, the current value from the `fifo_10_mux` input is stored into the FIFO memory cell, `fifo_10`."
