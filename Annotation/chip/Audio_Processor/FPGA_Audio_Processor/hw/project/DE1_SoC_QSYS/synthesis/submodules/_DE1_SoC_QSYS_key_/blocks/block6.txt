The block of code manages the reset and capture for an edge detection pipeline, integrating clock-edge-driven updates. When a negative edge on reset_n is detected, it initiates the reset condition setting 'edge_capture[0]' to zero. In the case of a positive clock edge (posedge clk), if the clock is enabled (clk_en true), it checks for write strobe (edge_capture_wr_strobe). If it's active, the system promptly resets 'edge_capture[0]' back to 0. However, if the first stage of the edge detection pipeline is activated (edge_detect[0] true), 'edge_capture[0]' is set to -1.
