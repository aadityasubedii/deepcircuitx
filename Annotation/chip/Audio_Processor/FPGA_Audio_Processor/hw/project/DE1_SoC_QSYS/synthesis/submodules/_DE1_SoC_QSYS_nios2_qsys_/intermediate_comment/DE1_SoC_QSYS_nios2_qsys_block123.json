    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily controls the update of the next state of the W_status_reg_pie instance based on different conditions. The new state of W_status_reg_pie instance is set to '0' if either an exception occurs (R_ctrl_exception), a break condition is met (R_ctrl_break), or a core reset condition happens (R_ctrl_crst). If none of these conditions occur, the block then checks for return-from-exception condition (D_op_eret) and sets the next state to W_estatus_reg value. Similarly, it also checks for a branch return (D_op_bret) and uses W_bstatus_reg value. If none of these conditions pass, it checks if control status is being written (E_wrctl_status) and uses the condition E_src1[0] for the next state. If none of these conditions are met, the next state is set to the current state of W_status_reg_pie instance."
