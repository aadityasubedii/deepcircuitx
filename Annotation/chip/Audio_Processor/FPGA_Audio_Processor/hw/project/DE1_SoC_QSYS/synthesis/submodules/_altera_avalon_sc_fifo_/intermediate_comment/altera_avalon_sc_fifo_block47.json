    "block_comment": "The block of code models a 'read' control signal in a hardware design. Specifically, 'read' becomes 'high' or 'true' when the output from the internal module (internal_out_ready and internal_out_valid) is ready and valid and the condition of forwarding data (ok_to_forward) is fulfilled. This is implemented using Verilog's 'assign' keyword, which continuously watches the three conditions and updates the 'read' signal accordingly."
