    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the logical AND operation output of `dct_is_taken` and `sync_timer_reached_zero` to `record_dct_outcome_in_sync`. `dct_is_taken` signifies if a decision has been made or an action has been done and `sync_timer_reached_zero` indicates if the synchronizing timer has reached zero. The result of their AND operation will be true if and only if both `dct_is_taken` and `sync_timer_reached_zero` are true, meaning if the action has been taken and the timer has reached zero. This is how the block keeps simultaneous track of an action's occurrence and time synchronization, enabling the system to act upon a taken decision at an appropriate synchronized time.\n"
