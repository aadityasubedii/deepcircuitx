    "block_comment": "The block of code enables the write function to the register file. It is defined as 'W_rf_wren', which is a Boolean combination of '(R_wr_dst_reg & W_valid)' OR 'not reset_n'. This means the write function is enabled either when 'R_wr_dst_reg' and 'W_valid' are both high, signaling that a write request is valid, or, by default, when the system is not resetting (with 'reset_n' at low)."
