This block implements a synchronized action in response to a system clock 'clk' or a negated reset signal 'reset_n'. When there's a rising edge on the clock or a falling edge on the reset signal, it checks the status of the reset signal (reset_n). If 'reset_n' is '0', it sets or resets a control signal 'R_ctrl_br_cmp' to '0'. If 'reset_n' is not '0', and the enable signal 'R_en' is '1', the block updates the 'R_ctrl_br_cmp' signal with the next value 'R_ctrl_br_cmp_nxt'.
