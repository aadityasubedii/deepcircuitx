Comment: 
This block of code is used to provide an indication of whether the FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer is free or not. To achieve this, the `assign` keyword is used to declare the `ge2_free` as a continuous assignment. The value of the `ge2_free` is the logical negation of the 5th bit (considering MSB as the first bit) of the `fifo_cnt` register, which means, `ge2_free` will be true (1) if the FIFO buffer is free (i.e., the 5th bit of `fifo_cnt` is 0), and false (0) if the FIFO buffer is not free or full (i.e., the 5th bit of `fifo_cnt` is 1).
