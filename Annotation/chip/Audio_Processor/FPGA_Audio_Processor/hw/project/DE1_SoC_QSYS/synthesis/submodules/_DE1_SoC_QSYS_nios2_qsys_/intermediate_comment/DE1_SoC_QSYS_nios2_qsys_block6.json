    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code determines if the \"D_ctrl_alu_force_xor\" is enabled or not. It activates this control signal when any of the comparison or branch operations are being executed. The block does this by using the bitwise OR operation (\"|\") to combine the activation conditions for numerous operations. If any one of the operations defined, such as \"D_op_cmpgei\", \"D_op_cmpgeui\" etc., are active, then \"D_ctrl_alu_force_xor\" is enabled."
