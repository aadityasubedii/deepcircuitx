This block of Verilog code is used for initial value assignment to specific variables. The operation of the block involves assigning initial values to 'wfifo_used', 'r_dat', 'fifo_FF', and 'wfifo_empty'. Value '0' is assigned to 'wfifo_used' with a 6-bit width, effectively zeroing out the variable. Similarly, 8-bit wide '0' is assigned to 'r_dat', and a single bit '0' is assigned to 'fifo_FF'. On the other hand, 'wfifo_empty' gets initialized with a single bit '1'.
