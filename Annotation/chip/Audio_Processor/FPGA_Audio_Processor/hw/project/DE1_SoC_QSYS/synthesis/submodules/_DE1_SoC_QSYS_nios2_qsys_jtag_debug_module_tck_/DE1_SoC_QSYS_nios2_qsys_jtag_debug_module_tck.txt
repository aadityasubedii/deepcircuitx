Module-level comment: 
The DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck is a JTAG debug module for a NIOS II system. The module stores, shifts and manages data based on the received JTAG instructions and signal states. Operation is primarily driven by the rising edge of the JTAG clock. Input ports capture control, status and data signals, while outputs represent instruction values and processed data. Internal signals control data register size, signal synchronization and data storage. Execution flow is mainly encompassed in an "always" block, partitioned by functionality depending on different control state combinations. Synchronization is handled by standard Altera synchronizers.
