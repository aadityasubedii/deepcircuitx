    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for handling shift register updates under different control states. The updates occur on the rising edge of the tick clock (tck). Depending on three signals (vs_cdr, vs_sdr and vs_uir), and the input instruction register (ir_in) or the Data Register size(DRsize) in some cases, the code specifies different operations. Particularly, in the first case block under signal 'vs_cdr' and 'ir_in', different segments of the shift register are selectively updated with various debug and monitor signals. In the second case block under 'vs_sdr' and 'DRsize', shift register updates follow a certain pattern where 'tdi\u2019 (Test Data In) pads the segment at both ends. The third case block under 'vs_uir' and 'ir_in' determines the size of the Data Register. This block is a typical example of a state-controlled data manipulator in hardware, often used in test, debug or monitor logic."
