Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_wrapper module acts as a hardware wrapper for JTAG debugging in a NIOS II embedded processor system on a DE1-SoC development board. Inputs capture essential breakpoint conditions, clock signals, tracing details, state identifiers, and memory diagnostics. Output and internal signals control JTAG operations and actions based on the break and memory conditions observed. Implementation is divided between the 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck' and 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_sysclk' modules, delivering flexible and thorough debugging functionality.
