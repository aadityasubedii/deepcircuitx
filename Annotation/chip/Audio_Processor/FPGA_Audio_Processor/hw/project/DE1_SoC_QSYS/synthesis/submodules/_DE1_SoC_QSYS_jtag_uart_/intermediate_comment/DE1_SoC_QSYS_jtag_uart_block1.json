    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for manipulating the 'dataavailable' signal based on the state of 'fifo_EF'. Implementation-wise, it uses an always block which continuously monitors the 'fifo_EF' signal and when there's a change in this signal, it negates its value and assigns it to 'dataavailable'. This makes 'dataavailable' signal high when 'fifo_EF' is low and vice versa.\n"
