    "block_comment": "This hardware block enables the 14th index of a FIFO (First In First Out) queue. It sets the enable signal (`fifo_14_enable`) for the 14th FIFO position under three conditions: firstly, when the write pointer is at the index 14 and there's at least one input (`input_ge1`) available, secondly, when `ge2_free` is asserted (indicating space is available), the write pointer incremented by one equals 14 and there are at least two inputs (`input_ge2`), and lastly, when `ge3_free` is asserted, the write pointer incremented by two equals 14 and there at least three inputs (`input_ge3`)."
