    "block_comment": "The block assigns unfiltered and aligned data from the av_ld data bytes to 'av_ld_data_aligned_unfiltered'. This is achieved by using the 'assign' keyword to define continuous assignments and concatenating the four bytes of data from 'av_ld_byte3_data' down to 'av_ld_byte0_data' together. This ensures that the data is in the correct order and maintains alignment."
