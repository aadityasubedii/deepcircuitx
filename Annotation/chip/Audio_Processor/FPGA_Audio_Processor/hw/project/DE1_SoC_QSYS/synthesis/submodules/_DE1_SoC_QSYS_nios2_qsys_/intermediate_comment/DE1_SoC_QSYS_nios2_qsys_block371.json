    "block_comment": "This block is a reset-able register that synchronizes a set of digital breakpoint modules in a system upon receiving a clock signal. On receiving a negative edge of a reset_n signal, all outputs are asynchronously reset to 0. Else, upon receiving a positive edge of the clock signal, it logically combines respective outputs from 4 digital breakpoint modules using bitwise OR operation and propagates the combined output signals."
