    "block_comment": "This block implements a resettable register for a comparison operation in a digital circuit. It initializes upon an active LOW reset signal or updates with the data input 'D_compare_op' on a rising clock edge. If 'reset_n' receives a negative edge trigger, or becomes 0, the register 'R_compare_op' is reset to 0. On a positive edge of 'clk', the register 'R_compare_op' is set to the input 'D_compare_op', which can be a comparison result or operand for next clock cycle's operation."
