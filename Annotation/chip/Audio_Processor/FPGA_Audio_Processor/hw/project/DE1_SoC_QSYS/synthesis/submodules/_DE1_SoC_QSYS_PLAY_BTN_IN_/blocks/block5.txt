Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for generating an interrupt request (irq) signal. It achieves this by performing a bitwise AND operation on 'edge_capture' and 'irq_mask', following which a bitwise OR reduction is performed on the result of the AND operation. This configuration implies that the ‘irq’ will be issued when there is a rising or falling edge captured (defined by 'edge_capture') and interrupts are enabled (defined by 'irq_mask').
