    "block_comment": "This block is primarily responsible for managing the fill level of a FIFO buffer. Upon a positive edge of the clock or a reset signal, the block checks if a reset has occurred, in which case it resets the fill level. If the FIFO has reached the maximum allowed size (next_full) and 'drop_on_error' is false, it sets the fill level to the depth size of the FIFO, effectively indicating the buffer is full. Otherwise, the fill level is updated to the difference between the write pointer (next_wr_ptr) and the read pointer (next_rd_ptr), providing the amount of filled space in the buffer."
