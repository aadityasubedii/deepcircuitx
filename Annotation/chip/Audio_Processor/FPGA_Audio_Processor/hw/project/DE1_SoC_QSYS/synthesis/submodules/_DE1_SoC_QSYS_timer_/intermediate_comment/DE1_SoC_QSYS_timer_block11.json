    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the signal period_h_wr_strobe based on a combinational logic operation. The value of period_h_wr_strobe will be high (1) when the chip is selected (chipselect is high), a write operation is not being performed (~write_n is high, since write_n is active low) and the target address is set to 3 (address == 3). If these conditions are not met, the output is low (0)."
