Comment: 
This block of code primarily behaves as a pass-through logic where the signals `reset_out_pre` and `reset_req_pre` are passed through to `reset_out` and `reset_req` respectively. The implementation employs a combinational always block (always @*) in Verilog RTL. Whenever there is a change in any of the input variables (`reset_out_pre`, `reset_req_pre`), the targeted outputs (`reset_out`, `reset_req`) are updated.
