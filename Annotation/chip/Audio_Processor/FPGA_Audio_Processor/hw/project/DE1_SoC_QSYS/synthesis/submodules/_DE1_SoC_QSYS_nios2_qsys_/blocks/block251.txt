This block of code is responsible for controlling Xilinx block RAM (xbrk) wrap trace-off condition. The block functions via a bitwise AND operation, which computes the logical conjunction of the tenth bit of the trace control (trc_ctrl[10]) register and trace wrap (trc_wrap) signal, finally assigning the outcome to the xbrk_wrap_traceoff signal.
