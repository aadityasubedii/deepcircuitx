This block of code functions to reset or update the variable `W_alu_result` based on the conditions of the clock and reset signals. When the active-low reset (`reset_n`) is triggered (`0`), the `W_alu_result` gets reset to `0`. However, when there's a rising edge on the clock (`clk`) and the reset isn't triggered, the `W_alu_result` gets updated with the value of `E_alu_result`. This block is typically used in synchronous digital designs where data needs to be reset or updated based on certain conditions.
