This block of code implements a synchronous reset mechanism and an input signal buffering scheme for a control signal in a digital system. It operates whenever there's a rising edge on the clock signal or a falling edge on the reset signal. If the reset signal level is 0 (reset situation), it resets the 'R_ctrl_custom' register to 0, enforcing a known start state. Otherwise, if the enable signal 'R_en' is high during a clock pulse, the register 'R_ctrl_custom' gets updated with the value of 'R_ctrl_custom_nxt', thereby buffering the input changes synchronous to the system's clock.
