This block of Verilog code is used to display an error message and halt simulation. The function of this block is error detection and signaling in case there are incorrect parameters. At the start of the execution, the $display system task is used to print a warning message onto the console indicating wrong parameter initiation. Following this, the $stop system task is executed to terminate the simulation in case of a detected error, thus, preventing any further erroneous operation. This is a basic debugging mechanism implemented in the initial stages of simulation.
