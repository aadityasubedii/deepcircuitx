    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the subtraction operation in the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). It achieves this through a dedicated assign statement which sets the D_ctrl_alu_subtract value as true if any of the listed operations (like subtract, less than, greater or equal, etc.) are requested, indicated by their corresponding operation codes (op-codes)."
