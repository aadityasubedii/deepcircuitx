This block of code is responsible for sensing a reset condition based on either a persistent reset request, or an adaptable reset request. The condition for the reset is triggered when either there is no pending reset request (RESET_REQUEST_PRESENT == 0) and no adaptive reset request (ADAPT_RESET_REQUEST == 0), or when there is an adaptive reset request (ADAPT_RESET_REQUEST == 1) but the output reset sync edges are not in a deasserted state. This logic ensures flexibility in triggering a reset, catering to both hardcoded and adaptive reset conditions.
