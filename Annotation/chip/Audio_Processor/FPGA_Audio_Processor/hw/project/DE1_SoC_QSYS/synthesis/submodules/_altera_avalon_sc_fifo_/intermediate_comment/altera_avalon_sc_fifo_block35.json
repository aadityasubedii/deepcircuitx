    "block_comment": "This block manages the status of reading and writing to a buffer in a Verilog design. It's controlling the process of updating flags ('next_full' and 'next_empty') based on various conditions. If a read operation is performed and not a write, 'next_full' is set to 0. 'next_empty' becomes 1 if 'incremented_rd_ptr' equals 'wr_ptr'. Conversely, if a write operation is performed without a read, 'next_empty' is set to 0 unless 'drop_on_error' is true and 'curr_sop_ptr' equals 'rd_ptr'. 'next_full' becomes 1 if 'incremented_wr_ptr' equals 'rd_ptr' and 'drop_on_error' is false. Lastly, if both read and write operations are performed and 'drop_on_error' is true, 'next_empty' becomes 1 if 'curr_sop_ptr' equals 'next_rd_ptr'. The block is thus used to manage data flow in and out of the buffer efficiently and prevent data loss or overwrites."
