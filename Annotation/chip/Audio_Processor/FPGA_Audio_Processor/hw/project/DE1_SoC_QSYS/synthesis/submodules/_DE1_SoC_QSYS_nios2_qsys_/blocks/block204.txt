The block assigns a 16-bit high value (R_src2_hi) based on the condition checks. Primarily, R_src2_hi is assigned a zero value if the control signals R_ctrl_force_src2_zero or R_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16 are high. If not, and signal R_ctrl_hi_imm16 is high, it is assigned with the 16-bit immediate value from the instruction word (D_iw_imm16). In another case, when using the immediate value is necessary (R_src2_use_imm), it assigns either low or high extreme based on the most significant bit. Lastly, if no previous conditions meet, it directly obtains the high half (16-bit MSB part) from the 32-bit wide register file port b (R_rf_b).
