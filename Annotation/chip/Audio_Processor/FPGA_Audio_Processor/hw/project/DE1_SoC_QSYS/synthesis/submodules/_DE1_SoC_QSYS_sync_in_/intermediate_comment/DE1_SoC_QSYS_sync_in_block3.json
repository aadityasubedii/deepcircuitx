    "block_comment": "The provided block captures an active edge in a synchronous signal. By using a positive-edge-triggered flip-flop, the block activates on either the positive edge of a clock signal or negative edge of a reset signal. If the reset is active (low), it clears the `edge_capture` variable. If the clock is enabled, it further checks if `edge_capture_wr_strobe` is high. If so, `edge_capture` is cleared; otherwise, if `edge_detect` is high, `edge_capture` is set to high (-1)."
