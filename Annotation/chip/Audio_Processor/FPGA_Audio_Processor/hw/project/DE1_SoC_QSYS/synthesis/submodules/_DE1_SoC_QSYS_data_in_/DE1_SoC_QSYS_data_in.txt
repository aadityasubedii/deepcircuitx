Module-level comment:

This module, DE1_SoC_QSYS_data_in, manages the processing and transfer of 16-bit data inputs into a system. It uses the 'address' input to select a particular part of data, which is then passed through to the 'readdata' output. With 'clk_en' and 'data_in' signals always enabled, the module handles data selection via 'read_mux_out' signal and 'address' input. On every positive clock edge, or if not in a reset state, the data is transferred to 'readdata', padded with zeroes for upper 16-bits. Reset operation is facilitated by 'reset_n' input.
