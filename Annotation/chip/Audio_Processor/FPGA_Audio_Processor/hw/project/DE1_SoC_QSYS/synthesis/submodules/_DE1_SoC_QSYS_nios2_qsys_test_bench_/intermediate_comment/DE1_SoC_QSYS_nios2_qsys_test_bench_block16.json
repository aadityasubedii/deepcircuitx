    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for handling error messages during simulation whenever the FPGA validation fails. It does this by monitoring the 'F_valid' signal on every positive edge of the system clock. If 'F_valid' returns an indeterminate ('x') result and the system is not in reset mode (reset_n is true), an error message is written, indicating the time of the error occurrence in nanoseconds, and the simulation is halted."
