This code block assigns the next state of read control signal for an instance in a read control module. The statement uses an assign keyword, which means it determines the continuous assignment of the value of variable `D_ctrl_rdctl_inst` to `R_ctrl_rdctl_inst_nxt`. The purpose of this operation is to ensure that the next state of the read control for the instance is updated correctly based on the current state.
