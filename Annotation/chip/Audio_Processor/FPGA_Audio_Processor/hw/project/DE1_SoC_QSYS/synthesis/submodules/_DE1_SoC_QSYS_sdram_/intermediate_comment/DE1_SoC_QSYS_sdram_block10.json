    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines an always block that is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock (clk) signal or the falling edge of the reset (reset_n) signal. This means that the operations inside this block will be executed during every clock cycle at the moment the clock signal goes high (posedge clk) or when the active-low reset signal goes low (negedge reset_n). The use of 'posedge' for the clock signal indicates a synchronous design, which synchronizes state changes with the system's clock cycles. On the other hand, 'negedge reset_n' ensures that the system can be reset as needed, regardless of the clock state, offering a means to place the system in a known state."
