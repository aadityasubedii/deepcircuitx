This single-line Verilog code block is responsible for wire assignment, particularly dealing with bus slicing or index slicing function. It assigns the value of specific indexed bits from the `trc_ctrl` bus wire to the `sync_code`. Specifically, it assigns the bits at index 2 and 3 from `trc_ctrl` to `sync_code`. So, `sync_code` will hold that specific part of the `trc_ctrl` data. In this way, it is able to extract and sync the required parts of the data.
