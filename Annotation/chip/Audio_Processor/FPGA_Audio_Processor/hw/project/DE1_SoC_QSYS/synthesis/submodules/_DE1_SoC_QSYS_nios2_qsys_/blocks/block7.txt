The block of code performs the function of a register which controls whether the second source operand is forcibly set to zero. The register updates with the clock's positive edge or when reset is active low. On low reset, it forces the source operand to be zero, if not on reset and the enable signal (R_en) is high, the register takes the value of the next state variable (R_ctrl_force_src2_zero_nxt).
