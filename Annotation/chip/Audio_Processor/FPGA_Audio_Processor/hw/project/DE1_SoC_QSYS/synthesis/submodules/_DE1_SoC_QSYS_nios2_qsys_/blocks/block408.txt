Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code assigns the value of `E_st_data` to `cpu_d_writedata`. The `assign` keyword is used to drive the `cpu_d_writedata` signal with the value of the `E_st_data` signal. It is effectively connecting the `E_st_data` output to the `cpu_d_writedata` input in the RTL schematic. This might be part of a larger memory write operation.
