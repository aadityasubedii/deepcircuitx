This block of code handles the reset and read operations for a certain hardware entity in a synchronous design. It is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal or the negative edge of the reset signal. The function is first check if the reset signal is active low or note. If it's active low, it does nothing and stays in its reset state; however, if it's not in the reset state it checks for a read signal. Upon detecting a read operation, an integrity check is performed on the `i_address` signal, if this check fails it logs an error and stops the operation.
