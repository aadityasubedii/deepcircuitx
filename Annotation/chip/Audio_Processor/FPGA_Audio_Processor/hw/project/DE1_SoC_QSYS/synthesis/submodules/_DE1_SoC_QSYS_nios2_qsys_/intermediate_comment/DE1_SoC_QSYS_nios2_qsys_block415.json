    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to arm a certain condition called 'xbrk0_armed'. This condition is based on bitwise AND operation performed on specific parts of the 'xbrk_ctrl0' bus and trigger state flags, specifically 'trigger_state_0' and 'trigger_state_1'. The result of these AND operations are then used in an OR operation to finally determine the state of 'xbrk0_armed'. The code implements this using bitwise operations for efficient computation."
