This block of code is assigned to manage the control for shift or rotate right operations in the next cycle of a Register. It does this by directly assigning the present state of 'D_ctrl_shift_rot_right' to 'R_ctrl_shift_rot_right_nxt', signifying that the next state of the control for shift or rotate right operation would be the present state of the 'D_ctrl_shift_rot_right'.
