Comment: 
This block is a synchronous sequential circuit element that updates a control signal for an indirect jump operation. It operates on the positive edge of a clock signal or the negative edge of a reset signal. During a reset (when `reset_n` is 0), the `R_ctrl_jmp_indirect` signal is cleared. Otherwise, if the enable signal `R_en` is active, the value of `R_ctrl_jmp_indirect` is updated to the next state 'R_ctrl_jmp_indirect_nxt' in the next clock cycle.
