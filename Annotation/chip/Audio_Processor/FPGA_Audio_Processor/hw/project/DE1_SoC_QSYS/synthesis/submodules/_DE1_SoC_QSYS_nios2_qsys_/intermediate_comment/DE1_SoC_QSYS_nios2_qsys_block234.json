    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a validation signal for data reading operations (F_valid). More specifically, it does so by performing a bitwise AND operation on the data read control signal (i_read) and the inverted data wait request signal (~i_waitrequest). The validation signal will be '1' or true when a read request is present and there's no pending wait request."
