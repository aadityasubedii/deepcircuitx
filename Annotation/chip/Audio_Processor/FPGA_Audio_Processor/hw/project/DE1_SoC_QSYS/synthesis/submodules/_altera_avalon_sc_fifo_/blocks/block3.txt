Comment: 
The block assigns the pointer to the start of packet (SOP) in a data stream. If the condition of a write operation occuring simultaneously with receiving both the start and end of packet flags is true, the pointer references the value of the write pointer (`wr_ptr`). Otherwise, it keeps referring to the current start of packet pointer (`sop_ptr`).
