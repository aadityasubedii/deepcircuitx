    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for assigning a value to E_st_data depending on the state of D_mem8 or D_mem16. It uses conditional ternary operators to determine the value of E_st_data. If D_mem8 is true, E_st_data takes the 4-bit concatenation of R_stb_data. If D_mem8 is false but D_mem16 is true, E_st_data is assigned the 2-bit concatenation of R_sth_data. If both D_mem8 and D_mem16 are false, E_st_data simply equals R_rf_b. This iterative structure offers flexibility in data assignment based on various conditions."
