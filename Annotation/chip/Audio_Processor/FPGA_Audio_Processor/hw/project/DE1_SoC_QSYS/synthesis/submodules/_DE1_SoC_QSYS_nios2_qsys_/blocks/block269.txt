Comment: 
This block of code enables a 16-slot FIFO buffer, specifically the 15th buffer slot. The FIFO is enabled in three conditions: when the write pointer is at 4'b1111 and there's at least one input data ("input_ge1" is high), or; when there's at least two free slots ("ge2_free" is high), the write pointer is at 4'b1110 and there're at least two inputs ("input_ge2" is high), or; when there's at least three free slots ("ge3_free" is high), the write pointer is at 4'b1101 and there're at least three inputs ("input_ge3" is high).
