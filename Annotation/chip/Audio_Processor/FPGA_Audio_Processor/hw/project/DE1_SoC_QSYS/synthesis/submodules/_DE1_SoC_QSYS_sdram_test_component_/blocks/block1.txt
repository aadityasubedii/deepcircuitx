This block assigns a specific 24-bit hexadecimal value to `txt_code` based on the value of `cmd_code`. It uses a chained condition check (ternary operator) in Verilog to match the `cmd_code` against eight possible 3-bit values, ranging from `3'h0` to `3'h7`. If `cmd_code` matches any of these, `txt_code` is set with the corresponding 24-bit value. If `cmd_code` does not match any of these values, `txt_code` defaults to `24'h424144`. The implemented design uses conditional statements for value mapping, making it efficient in this context.
