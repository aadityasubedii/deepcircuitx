Comment: 
This block of code assigns the `E_wrctl_estatus` signal a value. The assignment is based on a bitwise AND operation between the signal `R_ctrl_wrctl_inst` and a comparison operation, which checks whether `D_iw_control_regnum` equals to `3'd1` (decimal 1 represented in a 3-bit binary number). Therefore, if `R_ctrl_wrctl_inst` is high and `D_iw_control_regnum` equals 1, then `E_wrctl_estatus` is set high, otherwise it is low.
