    "block_comment": "This block assigns the 'edge_capture_wr_strobe' signal as per the given conditions. The 'edge_capture_wr_strobe' is asserted when 'chipselect' is high, 'write_n' is low, and the 'address' is set to three. These conditions ensure that 'edge_capture_wr_strobe' is given the trigger when a write signal is received for the appropriate address while the chipselect is active, most likely denoting an edge capture write operation for firmware or peripheral controls."
