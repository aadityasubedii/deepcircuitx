Comment: 
This block is a clocked sequential logic block with active-low reset. Whenever a rising edge is detected on the clk signal or a falling edge is detected on the reset_n signal, the block is activated. On reset (when reset_n equals to 0), R_logic_op register is cleared (set to 0). On every clock cycle when reset is not activated (reset_n not equal to 0), the value of D_logic_op is stored in R_logic_op register.
