Comment: 
The block assigns the value of `compute_input_tm_cnt` to `input_tm_cnt`. The `assign` statement in Verilog is used for continuous assignment, which means that whenever the value of `compute_input_tm_cnt` changes, the change will be reflected in `input_tm_cnt` as well. This block ensures the synchronization of these two entities in the design.
