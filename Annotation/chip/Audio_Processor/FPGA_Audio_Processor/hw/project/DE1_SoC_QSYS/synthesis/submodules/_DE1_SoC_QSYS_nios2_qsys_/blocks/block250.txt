Comment: 
This line of code is assigning the value of 'trc_wrap' to 'tracemem_tw'. It's essentially a wire assignment in Verilog, which is used to pass a signal from one module or block to another. Here, it's making 'tracemem_tw' mirror the value of 'trc_wrap'. Key point is, this assignment is continuous and occurs whenever the value of 'trc_wrap' changes. There are no specific implementation details as this is a simple signal assignment in Verilog.
