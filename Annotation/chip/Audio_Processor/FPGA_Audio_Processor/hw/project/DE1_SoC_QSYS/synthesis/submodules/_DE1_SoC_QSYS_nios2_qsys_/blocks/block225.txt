Comment: 
This block of code is assigning the value of the 'intr_req' signal. It determines the activation of an interrupt request based on two conditions: if the status register permits interrupts 'W_status_reg_pie' and if there are any pending interrupts 'W_ipending_reg'. The operation is implemented using the bitwise AND operator '&' to ensure that both conditions are satisfied for 'intr_req' to be asserted.
