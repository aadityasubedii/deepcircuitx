    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component and DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module.\n\nModule specification: \n\nThe 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module' is used as the memory storage for the tested system. It accepts the 16-bit 'data' input, along with read and write addresses inputs ('rdaddress' and 'wraddress'), and timing control inputs ('rdclken', 'wrclock' and 'wren'). It outputs a 16-bit 'q', representing data read from the memory. Its functionality relies on the internal signal 'mem_array' which acts as an internal memory initialized from the file 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component.dat'. Other internal signals include 'read_address' used to track the active read memory location. \n\nThe 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component' is a synthesizable test component consisting of multiple control lines like 'zs_cke' (clock enable), 'zs_cs_n' (chip select), 'zs_ras_n' (row address strobe), 'zs_cas_n' (column address strobe), and 'zs_we_n' (write enable) as input ports. It also has bidirectional data port 'zs_dq', that serves both as data input and data output. This module is designed to simulate accesses to SDRAM, and in its design, it instantiates a sub-component 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module' to handle memory-related operations. \n\nThe internal operations involve handling read/write masking, address translations, simulating latency for memory access, and clock operations. Internally, several registers and wires, like 'mem_array', 'read_address', 'CODE', 'a', 'addr_col', and 'mask' amongst others, are used to perform these operations. Comment generation for Verilog RTL codes facilitates this complex interaction between multiple modules and signals. \n\nDifferent blocks of code include the initial code to load the 'mem_array', continuous blocks to update 'read_address' based on changes in 'rdaddress', and 'q' based on 'mem_array' indices, as well as memory write operations conducted at every positive edge of the write clock when 'wren' is high. For 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component' module, different blocks of code are used for initialization purpose, map latency and addr_crb registers, read and write pipelines, read_mask, and read_valid signals, and for the ultimate data output. Combined, these modules perform complex operations indicative of an SDRAM testing component.",

DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component: This module is a synthesizable test component for simulating accesses to SDRAM. It connects to the SDRAM through the io port 'zs_dq' and various control lines such as 'zs_cke' (clock enable), 'zs_cs_n' (chip select), 'zs_ras_n' (row address strobe), 'zs_cas_n' (column address strobe), and 'zs_we_n' (write enable). Inside the module, a sub-component of type 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module' is instantiated to perform the memory-related operations. The module also handles read/write masking, address translations, as well as simulating latency for memory access."

It accepts the 16-bit 'data' input, along with read and write addresses inputs ('rdaddress' and 'wraddress'), and timing control inputs ('rdclken', 'wrclock' and 'wren'). It outputs a 16-bit 'q', representing data read from the memory. Its functionality relies on the internal signal 'mem_array' which acts as an internal memory initialized from the file 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component.dat'. Other internal signals include 'read_address' used to track the active read memory location. \n\nThe 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component' is a synthesizable test component consisting of multiple control lines like 'zs_cke' (clock enable), 'zs_cs_n' (chip select), 'zs_ras_n' (row address strobe), 'zs_cas_n' (column address strobe), and 'zs_we_n' (write enable) as input ports. It also has bidirectional data port 'zs_dq', that serves both as data input and data output. This module is designed to simulate accesses to SDRAM, and in its design, it instantiates a sub-component 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module' to handle memory-related operations. \n\nThe internal operations involve handling read/write masking, address translations, simulating latency for memory access, and clock operations. Internally, several registers and wires, like 'mem_array', 'read_address', 'CODE', 'a', 'addr_col', and 'mask' amongst others, are used to perform these operations. Comment generation for Verilog RTL codes facilitates this complex interaction between multiple modules and signals. \n\nDifferent blocks of code include the initial code to load the 'mem_array', continuous blocks to update 'read_address' based on changes in 'rdaddress', and 'q' based on 'mem_array' indices, as well as memory write operations conducted at every positive edge of the write clock when 'wren' is high. For 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component' module, different blocks of code are used for initialization purpose, map latency and addr_crb registers, read and write pipelines, read_mask, and read_valid signals, and for the ultimate data output. Combined, these modules perform complex operations indicative of an SDRAM testing component."
