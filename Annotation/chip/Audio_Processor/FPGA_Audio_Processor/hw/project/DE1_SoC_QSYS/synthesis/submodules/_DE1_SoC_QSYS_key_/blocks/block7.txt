This Verilog code block is responsible for generating a write strobe for the capture of edge transitions. It accomplishes this by employing an `assign` statement to develop a Boolean expression. The expression is true whenever `chipselect` is enabled, write operation is intended (`write_n` is inactive or LOW, and the address is set to 3. The resultant `edge_capture_wr_strobe` signal is thus generated only when these specific conditions are met.
