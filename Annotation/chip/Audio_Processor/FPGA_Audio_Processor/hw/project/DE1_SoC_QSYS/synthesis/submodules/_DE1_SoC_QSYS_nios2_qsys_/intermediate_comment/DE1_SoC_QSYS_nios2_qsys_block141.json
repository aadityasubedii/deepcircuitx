    "block_comment": "This block of code is a typical example of a synchronous design in Verilog which handles reset and data update scenarios. The function of this block primarily revolves around updating the 'W_control_rd_data' variable based upon the clock and reset signals. If the reset signal 'reset_n' is active (negative logic, 0 in this case), it forces 'W_control_rd_data' to be 0 irrespective of the clock signal. However, during every positive edge of the clock, if reset is inactive ('reset_n' is 1), 'W_control_rd_data' is updated with the value of 'E_control_rd_data'."
