    "block_comment": "The block assigns a relevant value to `fifo_14_mux` based on various conditional checks. It employs a series of nested ternary operator expressions to check certain conditions and assign an appropriate value. If the write pointer `fifo_wrptr` equals 14 and `itm_valid` is true, `itm` is assigned. If `atm_valid` or `dtm_valid` is true instead, `overflow_pending_atm` or `overflow_pending_dtm` is respectively assigned. If the `fifo_wrptr_plus1` equals 14 and various other conditions are satisfied (such as `ge2_free` and certain validity checks), the block assigns a corresponding `overflow_pending` value. If none of the specific conditions are met, `overflow_pending_dtm` is assigned as a default."
