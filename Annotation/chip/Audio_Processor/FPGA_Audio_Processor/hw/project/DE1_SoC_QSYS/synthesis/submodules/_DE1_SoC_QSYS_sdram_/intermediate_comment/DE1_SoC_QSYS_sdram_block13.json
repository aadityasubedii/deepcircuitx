    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a cyclical refresh request operation in a synchronous system. When reset (reset_n) is active ('0'), the refresh_request signal is deactivated. Otherwise, the refresh_request signal is maintained to '1' when the refresh_counter is '0' or there is a prior refresh request pending (signaled by refresh_request=='1'), as long as an acknowledgement for refresh_request (ack_refresh_request) is not received and the system operation has been initialized (init_done=='1')."
