    "block_comment": "This block of code creates a signal called `sync_interval` from the `sync_code` input. The new signal is formed by concatenating various boolean combinations of bits from `sync_code`, along with singleton bits. More adjacent bits from the `sync_code` are combined using bitwise AND, bitwise not, or direct value to generate each component of the `sync_interval` - these operations seem to isolate or combine specific conditions of the `sync_code` input. Online documentation or developers who have worked on this section of the codebase previously might have more context."
