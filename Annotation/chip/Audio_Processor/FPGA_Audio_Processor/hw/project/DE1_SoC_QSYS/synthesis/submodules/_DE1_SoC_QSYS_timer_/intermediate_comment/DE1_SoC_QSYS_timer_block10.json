    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a register 'period_l_register' with asynchronous reset and synchronous load feature. Upon a negative reset signal (reset_n == 0), the register 'period_l_register' will be loaded with a default value of 11927. If reset is not asserted and a write strobe signal 'period_l_wr_strobe' is received at the positive clock edge, the register will be loaded with the value stored in 'writedata'."
