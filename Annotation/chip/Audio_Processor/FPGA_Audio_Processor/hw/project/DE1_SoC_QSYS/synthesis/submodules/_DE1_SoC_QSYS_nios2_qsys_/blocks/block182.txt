The block of code determines the value of E_shift_rot_result_nxt based on several conditions. If E_new_inst is true, E_shift_rot_result_nxt is assigned the value of E_src1; otherwise, it checks if R_ctrl_shift_rot_right is true. In this case, E_shift_rot_result_nxt takes the concatenated value of E_shift_rot_fill_bit and E_shift_rot_result ranging from 31 to 1. If R_ctrl_shift_rot_right is false, then it takes E_shift_rot_result from 30 to 0 concatenated with E_shift_rot_fill_bit.
