    "block_comment": "This block assigns the output `D_ctrl_rot_right` based on the logical OR operation of the inputs which are `D_op_rsvx10`, `D_op_ror`, `D_op_rsvx42`, and `D_op_rsvx43`. The block utilizes bitwise OR operation which can give `D_ctrl_rot_right` a value of True if at least one of the inputs is True, and False only when all inputs are False, thus enabling `D_ctrl_rot_right` to respond to multiple control signals."
