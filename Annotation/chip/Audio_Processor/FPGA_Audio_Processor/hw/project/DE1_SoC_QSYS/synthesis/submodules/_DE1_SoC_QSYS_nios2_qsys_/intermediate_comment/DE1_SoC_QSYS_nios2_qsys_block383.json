    "block_comment": "This line of code is assigning a constant value to a wire or reg variable in Verilog. The wire or reg 'dbrk2_traceon' is assigned a value of binary 0. This type of assignment is continuous and the right-hand side expression is evaluated and assigned to the left-hand side immediately whenever a change happens. This particular assignment indicates typically that the trace/debug feature related to 'dbrk2' signal/operation has been turned off in the design."
