Comment: 
This block controls the subtract operation of ALU. In response to each rising edge of the clock or falling edge of the reset signal, it checks the reset condition first. If 'reset_n' is asserted (equivalent to '0'), it resets the 'R_ctrl_alu_subtract' control line to '0'. If 'reset_n' is not asserted and the 'R_en' control signal (likely an ALU enable signal) is active, it updates the value of 'R_ctrl_alu_subtract' to the next value 'R_ctrl_alu_subtract_nxt' at the next rising clock edge.
