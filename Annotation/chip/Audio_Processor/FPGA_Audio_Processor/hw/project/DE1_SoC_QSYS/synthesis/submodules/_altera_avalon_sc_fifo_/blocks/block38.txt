This block of code handles the reset and data update signals for a memory module. On receiving a positive edge clock or reset inputs, the code tests for reset; if true, it sets the 'i'th index of 'mem_used' to zero. However, if reset is false, the code checks for the values of `write` and `read` (which should be mutually exclusive) - if 'write' is active, it assigns the value of previous index `mem_used[i-1]` to the current index `mem_used[i]`. Conversely, when 'read' is active, it assigns the value from the next index `mem_used[i+1]` to the current index `mem_used[i]`.
