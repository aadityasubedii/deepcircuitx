    "block_comment": "The block functions as a 3-to-8 line binary decoder implemented with a case statement in Verilog, used to assign different values to the variable \"compute_input_tm_cnt\" based on the value of \"switch_for_mux\". The implementation uses a control line \"switch_for_mux\" to select specific cases. Depending on the case value, a specific binary value is assigned to \"compute_input_tm_cnt\". The control line ranges from '000' to '111', and each has a unique corresponding binary output."
