    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for reset control and CSR data reading. On a positive edge of a reset or clock signal, it resets the CSR read data when reset is high, or it sets the CSR read-data to zero if CSR read is active. If the CSR address equals zero, it updates the CSR read-data to reflect the `fill_level`. Here, the `fill_level` is padded with zeroes to match the width of the `csr_readdata`."
