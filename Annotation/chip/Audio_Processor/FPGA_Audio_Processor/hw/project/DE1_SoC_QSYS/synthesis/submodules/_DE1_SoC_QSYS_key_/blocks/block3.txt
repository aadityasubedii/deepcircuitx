The block of code handles system reset and edge capturing operations for a digital system. Upon a system reset or a falling edge (negative edge) of the reset signal, it resets the edge capture register (set as zero). If the system is not in a reset state and the clock enable (clk_en) signal is active, it will check two conditions: if the edge capture write strobe is active, it will reset the edge capture register; if not, but the edge has been detected, it will set the edge capture register to -1, indicating that an edge has been captured.
