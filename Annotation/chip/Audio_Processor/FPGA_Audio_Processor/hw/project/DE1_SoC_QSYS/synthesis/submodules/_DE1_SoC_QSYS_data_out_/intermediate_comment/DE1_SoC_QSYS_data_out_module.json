    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, DE1_SoC_QSYS_data_out, provides memory read-write functionality in a synchronous manner for a selectable chip. It uses internal signals like 'data_out' for storing write data and 'read_mux_out' for selecting data based on the address. 2-bit 'address' input allows for up to 4 memory locations, and data read or write is controlled via 'chipselect' and 'write_n' inputs, and accessed on 'out_port' and 'readdata' outputs. Reset functionality implemented through 'reset_n' input resets the 'data_out'."
