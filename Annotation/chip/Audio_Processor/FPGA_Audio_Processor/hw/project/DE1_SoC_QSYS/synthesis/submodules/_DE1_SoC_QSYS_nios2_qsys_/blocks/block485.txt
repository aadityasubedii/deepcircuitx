The block assigns specific 32-bit hexadecimal values to cfgrom_readdata based on the 3-bit value extracted from bits 2 to 4 of the MonAReg register. This is accomplished with a conditional (ternary) operator, which checks the value in the specified bits and assigns a corresponding hexadecimal value to cfgrom_readdata. If none of the conditions are met, a default value of 32'h00000000 is assigned.
