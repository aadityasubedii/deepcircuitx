    "block_comment": "The block defines a wire signal dbrk2_goto0 and assigns it a constant value of 0. This is implemented using the assign keyword of Verilog which allows for continuous assignment that is always active as long as the module is in scope. The constant bit value of 1'b0 is a binary literal in Verilog used as a placeholder to define the default state or initial condition of the wire."
