    "block_comment": "The block of code is assigning a logic value to the variable 'xbrk3_armed'. This is achieved by taking a bitwise AND operation between the fourth bit of the array 'xbrk_ctrl3' and the 'trigger_state_0', and the fifth bit of the array 'xbrk_ctrl3' with 'trigger_state_1' respectively. Then it performs a OR operation between these two results, the output of which gets assigned to 'xbrk3_armed'. The block effectively sets 'xbrk3_armed' based on the value of 'xbrk_ctrl3' and current trigger states."
