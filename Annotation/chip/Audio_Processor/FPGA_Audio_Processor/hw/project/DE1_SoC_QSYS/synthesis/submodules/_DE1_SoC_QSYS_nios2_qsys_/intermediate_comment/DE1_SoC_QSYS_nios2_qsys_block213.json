    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronous reset logic for a register. The block operates under the control of a positive edge clock or a negative edge reset signal. If the reset signal (`reset_n`) is 0, the block resets the 'R_wr_dst_reg' register to 0. Otherwise, it updates the 'R_wr_dst_reg' register with the value of 'D_wr_dst_reg' register at each clock tick."
