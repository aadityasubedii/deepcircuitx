    "block_comment": "This block assigns the `dbrk_hit3_latch` signal to 0 in Verilog, effectively initializing or resetting it. The implementation is direct and done through the 'assign' keyword which sets the signal `dbrk_hit3_latch` to the binary value `1'b0`. This ensures that `dbrk_hit3_latch` is at a known state or serves as a trigger for other design blocks when `dbrk_hit3_latch` changes value."
