    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the signal 'D_ctrl_ld_signed' as the logical OR of several other signals. It takes multiple signals as inputs (D_op_ldb, D_op_ldh, D_op_ldl, D_op_ldw, D_op_ldbio, D_op_ldhio, D_op_ldwio, D_op_rsv63) and applies the logical OR operation between each of them. The end result is that 'D_ctrl_ld_signed' will be true if any or all of the input signals are true, and false only if all the input signals are false."
