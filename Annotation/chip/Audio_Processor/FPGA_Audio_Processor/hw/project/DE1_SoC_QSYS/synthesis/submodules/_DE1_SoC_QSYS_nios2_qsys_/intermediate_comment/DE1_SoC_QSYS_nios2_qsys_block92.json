    "block_comment": "[Function of the block] This line of Verilog code establishes 'R_ctrl_exception_nxt' as the next state of control exception in the digital logic design. [Implementation details of the block] By using the 'assign' statement, it sets 'R_ctrl_exception_nxt' to have the same value as 'D_ctrl_exception'. This transition corresponds to a digital circuit behaviour where 'R_ctrl_exception_nxt' mirrors the current state of 'D_ctrl_exception' in the next clock cycle."
