    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed for edge-triggered resetting and updating of interrupt mask register. When the active-low `reset_n` signal is asserted, it resets the `irq_mask` register to zero. Alternatively, if the chip is selected (`chipselect` is high) and `write_n` is low indicating a write operation, and the `address` is equal to 2 (indicating the address of `irq_mask` register), then the data from `writedata[3:0]` is written into the `irq_mask` register at the positive clock edge. The operation of hardware indicated by this block of code follows synchronous reset and read-write mechanism protocols."
