    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog module, DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll, functions as an Altera Phase Lock Loop (PLL) to generate two output clock signals, each at 143 MHz frequency from the given 50 MHz reference clock signal. It incorporates an instantiation of the altera_pll component with specific parameters, and additional reset and lock status signals. 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1' are output clock signals, 'locked' indicates PLL stability, and 'refclk' and 'rst' are the reference and reset inputs respectively. It internally uses feedbacks 'fboutclk' and 'fbclk', although they are not explicitly declared. Functionalities are realized within the altera_pll block according to the configured parameters."
