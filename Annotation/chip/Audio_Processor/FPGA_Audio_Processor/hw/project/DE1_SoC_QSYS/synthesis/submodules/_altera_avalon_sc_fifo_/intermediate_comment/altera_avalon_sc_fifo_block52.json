    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for updating memory contents. Upon receiving a positive edge clock signal, it checks the state of the 'in_valid' and 'in_ready' flags. If both flags are true, it writes the 'in_payload' data to the memory at the location pointed by 'wr_ptr'. Independently of these flags, it reads from memory at every clock cycle, copying the memory contents at the address 'mem_rd_ptr' into 'internal_out_payload'."
