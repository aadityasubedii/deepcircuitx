    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the functionality of a counter with reset and reload capabilities. Upon a positive edge of the clock signal or a negative edge of the reset signal, the counter's condition is evaluated. If the reset_n signal is zero, the counter is set to a hexadecimal value of '22E97'. If the reset_n signal is not zero and either the counter is running or a force reload is commanded, then, if the counter value is zero or a force reload is commanded, the counter will be loaded with a new value. Otherwise, the counter value is decremented by one."
