    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code dynamically assigns a value to the fifo_5_mux signal based on various conditions involving write pointer signals and a data valid flags. The assignment depends on the current write pointer (fifo_wrptr) and the incremented write pointer (fifo_wrptr_plus1) compared to a constant value. If either the itm, atm or dtm flags are true and their corresponding signals indicate data is valid, then either the atm or dtm overflow values are assigned to the fifo_5_mux signal. If the last three conditions are met and there're free resources available (ge2_free), then the atm or dtm overflowing values assigned. If none of these conditions are met, overflow_pending_dtm is the default value assigned to fifo_5_mux."
