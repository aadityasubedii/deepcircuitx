    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_mult_cell module functions as a multiplier of two 32-bit unsigned inputs (A_mul_src1 and A_mul_src2), generating a 32-bit result (A_mul_cell_result). The multiplication operation is split into two sub-tasks: lower 16 bits multiplication (the_altmult_add_part_1) and upper-lower 16 bits multiplication (the_altmult_add_part_2). The result is synchronized by a clock signal and can be reset. Utilizes internal wires for partial results and clear signal when a reset is required. Achieves efficient, FPGA-friendly multiplication."
