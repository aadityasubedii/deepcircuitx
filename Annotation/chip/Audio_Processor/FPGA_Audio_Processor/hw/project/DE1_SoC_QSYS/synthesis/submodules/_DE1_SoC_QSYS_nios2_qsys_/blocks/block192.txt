Comment: 
This block of code assigns a 27-bit memory base address. It implements this by extracting the lower 27 bits from the arithmetic result (E_arith_result) that presumably comes from a previous computation stage. Specifically, the bit selection operator ':', is used in Verilog to index a bit slice from a wider bus, which here extracts the bits from number 26 down to 0.
