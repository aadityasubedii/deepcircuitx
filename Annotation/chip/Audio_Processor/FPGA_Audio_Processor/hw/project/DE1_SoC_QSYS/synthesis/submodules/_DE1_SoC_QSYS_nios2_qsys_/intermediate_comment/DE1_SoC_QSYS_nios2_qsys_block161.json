    "block_comment": "This Verilog block controls the state of the `av_ld_waiting_for_data_nxt` signal. The signal's next state is decided based on whether it is currently in 'waiting for data' mode. If it is, the signal negates its value when the `av_ld_getting_data` is asserted, effectively ending the 'waiting' state. If it's not, the signal goes into waiting mode if the control load both `R_ctrl_ld` and `E_new_inst` conditions are asserted."
