    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to assign a fixed value to a signal. Specifically, `xbrk3_value` is assigned the value of '0' in 32-bit binary format. It is implemented using the `assign` keyword, which in Verilog RTL code is a continuous assignment declaration that sets `xbrk3_value` equal to 32-bits of all zeros. This is a simple hardware assignment in Verilog which establishes the specific value for `xbrk3_value` at all times."
