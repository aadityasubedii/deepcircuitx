    "block_comment": "The code block is a synchronous process with reset operation used in flip-flops or registers in Verilog code designs. The process gets executed or triggered at the positive edge (rising edge) of a clock cycle or at the negative edge (falling edge) of a reset. This block of code works by setting the `E_src2` to zero when a reset is triggered, and on a clock's rising edge, it sets `E_src2` to the value of `R_src2`. This way, the code ensures that `E_src2` always mirrors the value of `R_src2` in every clock cycle unless a reset has been invoked."
