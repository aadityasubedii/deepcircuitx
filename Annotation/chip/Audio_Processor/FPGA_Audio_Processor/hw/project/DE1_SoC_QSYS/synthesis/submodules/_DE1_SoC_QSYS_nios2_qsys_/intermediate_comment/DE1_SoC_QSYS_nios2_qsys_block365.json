    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to set the system into debug mode. Specifically, the block assigns the constant value '0' (indicating \"off\" or \"low\" in logic) to the signal 'not_in_debug_mode', suggesting that the system is intended to operate in non-debug mode. This assignment is a simple, direct method for controlling the operational state of the system."
