    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is involved in data packet transmission where it conditions the payload formation based on CHANNEL_WIDTH. If the CHANNEL_WIDTH is greater than zero, the payload on both sides consists of packet signals, data, error, and channel signals. Conversely, if the CHANNEL_WIDTH equals zero, the channel output gets directly assigned to the channel input, and the payload doesn't include channel signals."
