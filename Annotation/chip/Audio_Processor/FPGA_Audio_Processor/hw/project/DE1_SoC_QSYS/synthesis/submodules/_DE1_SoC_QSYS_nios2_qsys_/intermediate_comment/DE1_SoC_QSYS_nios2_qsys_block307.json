    "block_comment": "This block is a flip-flop with asynchronous reset and conditional data loading for a technical construct known as 'fifo_4'. Upon detection of a negative edge on 'reset_n', the 'fifo_4' value is immediately reset to '0'. Alternatively, if a positive edge of 'clk' is detected and 'fifo_4_enable' is active, the value stored in 'fifo_4_mux' is loaded into 'fifo_4'."
