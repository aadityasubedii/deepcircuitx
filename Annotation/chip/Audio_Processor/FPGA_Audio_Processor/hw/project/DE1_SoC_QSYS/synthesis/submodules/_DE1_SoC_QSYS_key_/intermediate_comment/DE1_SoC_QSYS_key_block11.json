    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for initializing the value of the variable `readdata` based on the state of `reset_n` and `clk_en`. It waits for a clock posedge or a negative edge of reset signal `reset_n`. If a negative edge of `reset_n` is encountered, it means that a reset signal has been sent, then `readdata` is cleared to `0`. If a positive edge of the clock `clk` is encountered and the clock-enable `clk_en` signal is true, `readdata` is updated with the last 32 bits of data from `read_mux_out`. The use of else if implies a priority here: the reset operation has a higher priority over the normal data update operation."
