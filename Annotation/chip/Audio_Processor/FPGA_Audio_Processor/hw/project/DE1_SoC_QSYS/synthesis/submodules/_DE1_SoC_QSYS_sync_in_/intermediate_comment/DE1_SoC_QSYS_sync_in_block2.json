    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous dual-stage data pipe. It functions to latch input data 'data_in' into registers 'd1_data_in' and 'd2_data_in', where the latching is controlled by 'clk_en' enable signal, while being reset asynchronously by the 'reset_n' signal. The first 'if' clause ensures that registers 'd1_data_in' and 'd2_data_in' are reset to 0 when 'reset_n' is negated. In the 'else if' clause, when the clock is on the positive edge and the 'clk_en' is high, 'data_in' is latched into 'd1_data_in' on the next clock cycle, and 'd1_data_in' gets passed to 'd2_data_in', thus creating a two-stage pipe for the incoming data."
