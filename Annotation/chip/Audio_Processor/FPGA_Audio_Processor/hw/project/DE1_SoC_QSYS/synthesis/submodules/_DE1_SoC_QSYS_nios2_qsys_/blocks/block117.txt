Comment: 
The block assigns a new value to the `W_ienable_reg_nxt` register. If `E_wrctl_ienable` and `E_valid` are high, the value of `E_src1` from [31:0] is assigned; else, the current value of `W_ienable_reg` is kept. Furthermore, an AND operation is performed with the constant '32'b00000000000000000000000000111111' effectively restricting the register value to the lower six bits.
