Comment: 
This block of code controls a synchronous timer's next state. If `sync_timer_reached_zero` is true (which implies the timer has reached zero), `sync_timer_next` gets the same value as the current `sync_timer`. Else, `-1` is subtracted from `sync_timer` and assigned to `sync_timer_next`. This operation is essentially a countdown or decremental operation, which continues until `sync_timer` reaches zero.
