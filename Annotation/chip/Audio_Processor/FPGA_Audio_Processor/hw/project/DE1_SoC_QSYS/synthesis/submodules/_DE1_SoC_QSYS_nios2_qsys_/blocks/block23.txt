The block of code assigns the next state value of 'R_ctrl_b_is_dst_nxt' based on the current state value of 'D_ctrl_b_is_dst'. The execution of this assignment happens on every positive or negative edge of the clock. In the context of designing Finite State Machines (FSMs), this is typical for a synchronous design where state transitions are clocked. The next state value is determined by the current state, in this case, 'D_ctrl_b_is_dst' directing the transition to 'R_ctrl_b_is_dst_nxt'. Here 'R_ctrl_b_is_dst_nxt' is likely a register storing the state for use in the next clock cycle.
