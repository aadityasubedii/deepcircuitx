Comment: 
The block of code manages the initialization and updating of the interrupt request (irq) mask in a synchronous system. At every positive edge of the clock, if the reset signal is active, the irq_mask is set to 0 which effectively disables all interrupts. However, if the chip is selected and not in write mode, and the address matches 2, the irq_mask adopts the value of writedata, updating the mask as per the data written on that address.
