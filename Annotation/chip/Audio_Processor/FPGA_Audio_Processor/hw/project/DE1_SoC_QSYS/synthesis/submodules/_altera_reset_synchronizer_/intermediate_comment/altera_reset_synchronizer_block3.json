    "block_comment": "The block of code serves as a reset synchronizer. The synchronizer helps in syncing the asynchronous reset input with the system clock. At every positive edge of the system clock, it shifts the values in the reset synchronizer chain to the left by one bit position and synchronously assigns the asynchronous reset input to the most significant bit of the chain. This helps mitigate metastability issues commonly associated with asynchronous signals due to crossing clock domains. The output of the synchronizer chain becomes the least significant bit of the chain."
