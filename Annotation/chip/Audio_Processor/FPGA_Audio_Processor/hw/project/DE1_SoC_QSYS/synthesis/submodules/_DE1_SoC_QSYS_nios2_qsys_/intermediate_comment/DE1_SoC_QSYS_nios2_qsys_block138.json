    "block_comment": "This Verilog block describes a synchronous register with active low reset functionality. This register reacts to positive clock edges and negative edges of the reset signal. If a negative edge of the reset signal ('reset_n') is detected, it forcibly initializes the output 'W_status_reg_pie' to zero, irrespective of the current clock state. Otherwise, during every positive clock edge, the state of the output 'W_status_reg_pie' is updated to the value of 'W_status_reg_pie_nxt'."
