This block is a reset and read/write operation for an FIFO (First In, First Out) memory module. Upon a negative reset signal, it clears the write/read addresses and the number of entries. During a clock cycle, based on the value of `rdwr`, it either increments the write address and entries if the memory is not full or increments the read address and decreases entries if the memory is not empty. If the value is `2'd3`, both read and write addresses are incremented. The address increment operations also wrap-around when the current address is `1`.
