This block of code functions as an asynchronous reset and synchronous snapshot mechanism for an internal counter. Upon negative edge detection on `reset_n`, the `counter_snapshot` is reset to 0. Meanwhile, if `snap_strobe` is high at a positive clock edge `clk`, the current state of `internal_counter` is captured in `counter_snapshot`.
