    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the `E_wrctl_bstatus` signal based on the logical AND operation between `R_ctrl_wrctl_inst` and the comparison of `D_iw_control_regnum` with a 3-bit binary number '2'. Essentially, the block checks if `D_iw_control_regnum` equals to '2' while `R_ctrl_wrctl_inst` is true, if both conditions are satisfied, `E_wrctl_bstatus` is assigned 1, otherwise it remains 0."
