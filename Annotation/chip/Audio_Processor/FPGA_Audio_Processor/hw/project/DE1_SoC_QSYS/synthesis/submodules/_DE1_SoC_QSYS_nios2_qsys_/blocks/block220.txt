Comment: 
The block of code is a multiplexer that assigns the destination register number for an instruction in a pipelined processor. The number is selected based on a set of control signals. If the return address is to be implicitly set as a destination(`D_ctrl_implicit_dst_retaddr`), then 31 is selected. If the exception return address is to be implicitly set(`D_ctrl_implicit_dst_eretaddr`), 29 is selected. If 'b' is the designated destination(`D_ctrl_b_is_dst`), the b-th instruction window is selected as the destination(`D_iw_b`). If none of these signals are true, the c-th instruction window is chosen as the destination(`D_iw_c`).
