Comment: 
This block of code controls the status of a pending hardware breakpoint in a digital system. The block activates on the rising edge of a clock cycle or the falling edge of a reset signal. If a reset is initiated (reset_n is 0), the hardware breakpoint flag is cleared (hbreak_pending is set to 0). Otherwise, the flag is updated to its next state (hbreak_pending_nxt) during the next clock cycle.
