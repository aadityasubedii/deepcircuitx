Module name: altera_reset_controller. 

Module specification: The altera_reset_controller is a module designed to manage and synchronize reset signals in a digital system, using various parameters to allow adaptive configuration. The module's functionality includes the acceptance of multiple reset signals and reset requests, using these inputs to assert an output reset and reset request signal depending on the system state and parameters.

Input ports include 16 reset signals (reset_in0 to reset_in15) serving as external reset signals, and 16 reset request signals (reset_req_in0 to reset_req_in15) serving to assert the request for reset. Additionally, a clock input (clk) is included, which is required for system synchronization.

Output ports include a reset output signal (reset_out) that merges all reset inputs post synchronization. A reset request output signal (reset_req) is also provided, which is determined by the earliest of reset requests.

Several internal signals are parallelly managed within the altera_reset_controller like ASYNC_RESET, reset_out_pre, altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain, r_sync_rst_chain. These are utilized in synchronization, merging reset inputs, manage metastability and also generate final reset and reset request signal.

The code is divided into several blocks including parameter definition, input-output definition, internal parameter definition, and signal synchronization. This includes synchronizers for reset and reset request signals. The module also includes the code for managing reset and reset request chains internally. In the end, it has the code to generate final reset and reset request signals through several conditions and parameters. The module is well organized and detailed in nature, providing a comprehensive solution for complex reset signal synchronization.
