Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is responsible for the assignment of an address to the `ociram_addr` variable. The address value depends on the condition `jtag_ram_access`. If `jtag_ram_access` is true, the bits from 2 to 9 from `MonAReg` are used as the address. If the `jtag_ram_access` is false, bits from 0 to 7 from `address` are assigned to `ociram_addr`.
