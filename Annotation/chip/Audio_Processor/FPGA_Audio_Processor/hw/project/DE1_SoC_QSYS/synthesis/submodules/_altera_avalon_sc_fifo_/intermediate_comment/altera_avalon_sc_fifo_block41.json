    "block_comment": "This block defines a memory usage control system, sensitive to rising edges of the clock or the reset signal. On the occurrence of a reset, the block sets the memory used (indicating the amount of memory used in the last address, DEPTH-1) to zero. In the absence of a reset signal, if the write signal is different from the read signal, it again sets the memory used in the last slot to zero but, if the write signal is active, it assigns the value of the memory used in the second last slot (DEPTH-2) to the last slot (DEPTH-1)."
