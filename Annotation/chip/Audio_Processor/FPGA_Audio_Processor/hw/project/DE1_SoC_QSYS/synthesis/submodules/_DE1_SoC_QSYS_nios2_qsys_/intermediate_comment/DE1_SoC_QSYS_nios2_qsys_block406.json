    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the status of a wait request signal to a CPU-specific wait signal. Specifically, the 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used to continuously drive signals, meaning 'cpu_d_wait' is always set to the value of 'd_waitrequest'. This assignment is often used in bus management, allowing the CPU to know when to halt data transfer due to a pending wait request."
