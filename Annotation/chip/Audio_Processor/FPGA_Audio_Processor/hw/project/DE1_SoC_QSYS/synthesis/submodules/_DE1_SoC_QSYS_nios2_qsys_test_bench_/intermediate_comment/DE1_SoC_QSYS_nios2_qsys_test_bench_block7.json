    "block_comment": "This block operates as a clocked synchronization, error detection, and reporting mechanism. By triggering on both the rising edge of the clock and the falling edge of reset_n, this block ensures synchronization to system timing. In the case of a reset (indicated by reset_n becoming 0), nothing happens. However, if no reset is active and a read or write operation takes place (as indicated by d_write or d_read), the block further checks the validity of the address signal (d_address). If the address is determined to be invalid (represented by a 'x'), an error message is logged with the current system time, followed by the termination of the execution.\n"
