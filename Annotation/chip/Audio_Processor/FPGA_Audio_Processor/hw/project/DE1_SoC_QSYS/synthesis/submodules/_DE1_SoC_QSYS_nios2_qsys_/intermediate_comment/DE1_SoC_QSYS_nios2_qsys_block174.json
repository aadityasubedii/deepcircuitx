    "block_comment": "The block is implementing byte-enabling for memory addressing. It determines which bytes of a 4-byte word are to be used based on the size of the memory and the base address of the memory. This is done using a combination of bitwise operations and conditional logic to map different memory sizes and base addresses to corresponding byte enable codes. Specifically, it uses a ternary operation where different combinations of memory size and base address, defined by D_iw_memsz and E_mem_baddr[1 : 0] respectively, are compared and assigned to different byte enable codes."
