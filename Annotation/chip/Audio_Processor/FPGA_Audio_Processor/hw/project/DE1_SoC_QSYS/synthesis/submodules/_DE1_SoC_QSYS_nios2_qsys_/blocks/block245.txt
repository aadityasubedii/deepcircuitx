The block of code is used to update the state of the 'writedata' signal. In this implementation, the 'writedata' signal is updated on either a positive edge of the 'clk' signal or a negative edge of the 'jrst_n' signal. When 'jrst_n' signal is zero, 'writedata' is reset to zero. Otherwise, the value of 'writedata' is updated with the next state 'writedata_nxt'.
