This block of code assigns the value of `D_wr_dst_reg`. It sets `D_wr_dst_reg` to true only if the `D_dst_regnum` is not zero and `D_ctrl_ignore_dst` is not active. This implies that it checks if there is a valid destination register to be written to and that there is no instruction active that ignores the destination register. With the bitwise `&` operator, the block ensures both conditions must be met for a true assignment.
