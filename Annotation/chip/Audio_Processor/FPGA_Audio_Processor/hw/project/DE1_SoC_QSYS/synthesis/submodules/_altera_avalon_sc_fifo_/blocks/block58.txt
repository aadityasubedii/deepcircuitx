Comment: 
This block generates payloads by combining various input signals based on specific conditions. If both 'ERROR_WIDTH' and 'CHANNEL_WIDTH' are greater than zero, it assigns a composite payload from the signals 'in_data', 'in_error', and 'in_channel'. The payload is then unbundled into the signals 'out_data', 'out_error', and 'out_channel' in the same order as they were combined.
