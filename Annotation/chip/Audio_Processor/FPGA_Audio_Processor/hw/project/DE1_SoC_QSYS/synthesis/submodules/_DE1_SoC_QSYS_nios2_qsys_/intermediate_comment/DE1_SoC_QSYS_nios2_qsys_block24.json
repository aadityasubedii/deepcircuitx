    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for control signal assignment, specifically determining whether a destination is intended for the 'D_ctrl_b' signal. This is determined through Boolean OR operations on various operation codes (opcodes). These opcodes represent diverse operations such as add immediate ('D_op_addi'), compare less than immediate ('D_op_cmplti'), jump immediate ('D_op_jmpi'), loading a byte ('D_op_ldb') and many more. The assignment operation sets 'D_ctrl_b_is_dst' to be HIGH if any of these opcode conditions are true during execution of the instruction set."
