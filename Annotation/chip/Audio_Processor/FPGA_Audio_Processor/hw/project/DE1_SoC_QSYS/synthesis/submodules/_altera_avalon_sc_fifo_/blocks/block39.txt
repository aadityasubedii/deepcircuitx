This block of Verilog code is used for a looping operation to implement storage logic. It's a for loop that initiates with index 'i' at 1 and runs until i is less than DEPTH-1, incrementing 'i' at each iteration. The loop runs for each element in the range from 1 to DEPTH-2 to control storage elements or array indexing, according to the label 'storage_logic' provided. The loop structure suggests the usage in a memory component or buffer designed in the RTL where index manipulation is required.
