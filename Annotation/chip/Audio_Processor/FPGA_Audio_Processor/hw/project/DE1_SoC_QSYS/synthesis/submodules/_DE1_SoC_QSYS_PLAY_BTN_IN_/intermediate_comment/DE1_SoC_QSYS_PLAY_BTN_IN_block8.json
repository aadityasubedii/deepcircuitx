    "block_comment": "The block of code describes a latch function that is used for read data storage. In the presence of a reset signal, it sets the readdata value to 0. When the clock enable (clk_en) is high, it latches the data from read_mux_out, which is concatenated with 32-bit zero (for potential higher bit-width compatibility), to the readdata on every positive clock edge."
