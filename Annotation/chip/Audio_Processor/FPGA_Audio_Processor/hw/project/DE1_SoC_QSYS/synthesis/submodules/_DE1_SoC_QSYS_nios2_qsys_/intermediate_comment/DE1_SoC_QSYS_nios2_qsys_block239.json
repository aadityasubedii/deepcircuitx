    "block_comment": "This line of code is assigning the value 0 to the signal debugging request (debugreq). The keyword 'assign' is used to perform continuous assignments in Verilog. These assignments drive the value of the expression on the right (0 in this case) onto the net on the left (debugreq) whenever the right-hand side changes. This means that the debugreq is constantly held at the logic state 0, indicating no debug request is present."
