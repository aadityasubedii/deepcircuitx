    "block_comment": "This Verilog block provides a mechanism to halt system execution if there's a non-deterministic value for 'd_write' during the positive edge of the clock cycle. On each positive clock edge, it checks if the reset_n flag is set. If so, it performs a bitwise XOR operation on all bits of 'd_write'. If the result of the XOR is indeterminate (denoted by '1'bx'), it logs an error message indicating the 'd_write' is 'x', along with the timestamp, and then stops system execution.\n"
