    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code mainly creates a continuous assignment statement. Its function is to assign the value of 'av_ld_aligning_data' to 'av_ld_extend'. The assignment is carried out continuously, meaning the system will constantly monitor the value of 'av_ld_aligning_data' and update 'av_ld_extend' as needed. This ensures that 'av_ld_extend' always mirrors the value of 'av_ld_aligning_data', providing synchronization between these variables."
