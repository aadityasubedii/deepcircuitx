    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for the assignment of the 'xbrk2_armed' signal. The 'xbrk2_armed' signal is set based on a logical OR operation, derived from the logical AND operations of the fifth bit of 'xbrk_ctrl2' with 'trigger_state_0', and the sixth bit of 'xbrk_ctrl2' with 'trigger_state_1'. If either of these AND operations evaluate to true, 'xbrk2_armed' will be set to true as well."
