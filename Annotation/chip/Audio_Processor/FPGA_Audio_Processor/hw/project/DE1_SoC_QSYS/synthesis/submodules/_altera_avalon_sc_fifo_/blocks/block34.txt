Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used to manage a synchronous reset of a memory buffer's status flags. When a positive edge of reset or clock is detected, it checks if the reset signal is high. If it's high, it asserts the 'empty' flag, indicating that the buffer is now empty, and de-asserts the 'full' flag, indicating that the buffer is not full. However, if the reset signal is not high (i.e., we are in a normal operation mode), it updates the 'empty' and 'full' flags with the values of 'next_empty' and 'next_full', which are usually set elsewhere in the code depending on the buffer's operations.
