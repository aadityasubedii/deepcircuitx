    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to generate an interrupt request signal, `irq`. It accomplishes this using a bitwise AND operation (denoted by `&`) between the `edge_capture` and `irq_mask` signals, followed by a bitwise OR reduction operation (denoted by `|`). This construct effectively flags an interrupt request when there's an edge capture event (`edge_capture` is set) that is also unmasked (`irq_mask` is set)."
