The block of code manages the enabling of a FIFO queue identified as 'fifo_3'. It enables 'fifo_3' under several conditions. First, when the FIFO write pointer is equal to 3 (binary 4'd3) and a certain input condition 'input_ge1' is met. Secondly, the block checks if another condition 'ge2_free' is true, the FIFO write pointer incremented by 1 is equal to 3, and another input_condition 'input_ge2' is true. Lastly, if 'ge3_free' is true, when FIFO write pointer incremented by 2 equals 3 and the condition 'input_ge3' is met, 'fifo_3' is enabled. The block uses bitwise AND '&&' and OR '||' operators to determine the condition for enabling 'fifo_3'.
