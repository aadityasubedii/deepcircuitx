    "block_comment": "This block of code is designated to manage a register (R_ctrl_hi_imm16) reset and update process. It relies on the positive edge of an external clock signal or the negative edge of a reset signal (inverted). The functionality is implemented such that when the reset signal is active, it immediately clears the register value. Contrastingly, if the enable signal (R_en) is active during a positive clock edge, the register value will be updated to the value specified in 'R_ctrl_hi_imm16_nxt'.\n\n"
