    "block_comment": "The block of code is essentially performing a simple zero-detection operation. Specifically, it checks if the value of `E_logic_result` is equal to zero. This is implemented using the system function `assign`, which assigns the logic result of `E_logic_result == 0` to `E_logic_result_is_0`. The output `E_logic_result_is_0` will be high (1) if `E_logic_result` is zero and low (0) if not."
