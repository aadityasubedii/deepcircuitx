Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for controlling the write strobe for the 'period_l' register in a digital system. It does so by combining three conditions through bitwise operations: 'chipselect' must be active, 'write_n' must be inactive (signified by the negation operator '~'), and the 'address' must equal 2. When these conditions are all met, the 'period_l_wr_strobe' signal is activated, signifying that the 'period_l' register can be written to.
