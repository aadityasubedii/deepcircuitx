    "block_comment": "The block handles the control and increment of addresses and wrap signals within a trace controller based on a number of set conditions. Upon each positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the jrst_n signal, the block checks a sequence of conditions and based on each, sets the state of trc_im_addr and trc_wrap. Specifically, if jrst_n signal is low or '0', both trc_im_addr and trc_wrap are reset to '0'. Similarly, in the next condition block, both variables are reset as well. Following this, if the take_action_tracectrl flag is high and either of jdo[4] or jdo[3] is high, the respective variable is reset again. Else, if all the trc_enb, trc_on_chip, and tw_valid flags are high, trc_im_addr is incremented and if all bits of trc_im_addr are high, trc_wrap is set to '1'.\n"
