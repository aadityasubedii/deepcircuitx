    "block_comment": "This single line of Verilog code is performing a simple data transfer operation. The purpose of this block is to assign the value of the variable 'D_ctrl_retaddr' to the variable 'R_ctrl_retaddr_nxt'. It achieves this operation at every clock cycle due to the 'assign' keyword used, ensuring the update of 'R_ctrl_retaddr_nxt' as soon as 'D_ctrl_retaddr' changes."
