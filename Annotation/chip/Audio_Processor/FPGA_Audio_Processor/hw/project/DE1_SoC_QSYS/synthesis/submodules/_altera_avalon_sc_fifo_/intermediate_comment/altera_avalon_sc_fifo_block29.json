    "block_comment": "The block controls the flag for data validity in a queue or buffer based operation. The 'internal_out_valid' signal is set to invalid during a reset. During the clock's positive edge, if no reset is present, it determines 'internal_out_valid' based on a variety of conditions: It checks if the buffer is not empty, it is safe to forward, and no error mandates data to be dropped. Additionally, during a read operation, it prevents buffer underflow by further overriding 'internal_out_valid' to zero if the read and write pointers coincide, indicating an empty buffer."
