This block assigns the next state for an indirect jump control signal in a pipeline stage of a processor. It achieves this function through a direct assignment in Verilog under non-blocking manner, where the signal 'D_ctrl_jmp_indirect' directly drives the next state 'R_ctrl_jmp_indirect_nxt'. This is usually done in the data path of the pipeline as an indication of control flow change due to indirect jumps.
