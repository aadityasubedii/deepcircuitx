Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sysid_qsys. 

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sysid_qsys module serves as a system identifier in the system, which operates based on the clock signals and includes a reset mechanism. The module contains three input ports namely 'address', 'clock', and 'reset_n'. The 'address' port provides input data or signals to the module, and depending on its value, a specific output is assigned to the 'readdata'. The 'clock' port oversees synchronous clock signals, defining the timing for internal operations within the module. 'reset_n' serves as an active-low reset signal for resetting operations or internal states. The module has an output port 'readdata', which relays the data from the module depending on the value of the 'address'. If the 'address' input is true (non-zero), it assigns a hardcoded decimal value (1494305126), otherwise 0 is assigned. A single internal signal, 'readdata', declared as a 'wire', holds and forwards the data output. This signal is critical for the output of data based on the provided input and conditions. The primary block of the code is the assignment of the 'readdata' based on the condition and value of the 'address' input.
