Module name: altera_avalon_sc_fifo. Module specification: This module implements a scalable Avalon Streaming (Avalon-ST) source and sink synchronous FIFO with configurable depth, data width, and additional features. It supports packet mode, store-and-forward operation, and control status register (CSR) interfaces. The module has input ports for clock, reset, data input, control signals, and CSR operations, and output ports for data output, status signals, and CSR readback. Key internal signals include memory arrays, read/write pointers, and status flags for FIFO management. The module is divided into several functional blocks: memory management (using either registers or memory blocks), read/write operations, packet handling, fill level tracking, and CSR interface. It implements features such as almost full/empty flags, error handling, and cut-through operation. The design uses generate statements to create hardware
