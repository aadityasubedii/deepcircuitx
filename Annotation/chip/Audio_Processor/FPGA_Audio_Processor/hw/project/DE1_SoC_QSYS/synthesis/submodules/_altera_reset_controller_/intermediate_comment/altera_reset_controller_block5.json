    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for synchronizing a reset signal with the system clock to prevent spurious resets, usually called a reset synchronizer. It uses a shift register implementation where the 'clk' signal triggers the movement of bits in the shift register. The original reset signal 'reset_out_pre' is fed into the shift register and subsequent clock edges propagate this reset through the 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain' array. The output is then a delayed version of 'reset_out_pre' that is synchronized with the clock signal."
