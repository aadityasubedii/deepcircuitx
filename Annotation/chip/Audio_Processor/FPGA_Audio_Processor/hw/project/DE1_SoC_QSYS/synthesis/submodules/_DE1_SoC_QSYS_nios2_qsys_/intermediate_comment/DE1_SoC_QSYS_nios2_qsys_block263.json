    "block_comment": "This block is performing a concatenation operation. Specifically, it generates an overflow signal which occurs when the 'atm' signal reaches its 35-bit boundary. The 'overflow_pending' signal is concatenated with a 35-bit selection (from bit 34 to 0) of the 'atm' signal, forming a new signal 'overflow_pending_atm'. This block ensures that an overflow flag signal is generated when the 'atm' signal exceeds the specified limit for a 35-bit logic vector."
