This block of code is used to initialize a reset synchronization chain, which is implemented as a vector called 'r_sync_rst_chain', with high value ("1") for all positions. It employs the concatenation operation in Verilog to do this, where 'ASSERTION_CHAIN_LENGTH' defines the length of the vector.
