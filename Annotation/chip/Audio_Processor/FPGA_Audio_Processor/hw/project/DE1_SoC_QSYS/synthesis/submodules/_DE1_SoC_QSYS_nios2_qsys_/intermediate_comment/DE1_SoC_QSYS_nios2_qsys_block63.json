    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for generating the output for a control logic unit (D_ctrl_logic). This is achieved by performing a bitwise OR operation on multiple boolean inputs, which represent various control signals (D_op_and, D_op_or, etc.). The resultant signal is then actively driven on to the D_ctrl_logic signal, effectively showing that the control logic unit operation is determined by any of these input signals being actively high."
