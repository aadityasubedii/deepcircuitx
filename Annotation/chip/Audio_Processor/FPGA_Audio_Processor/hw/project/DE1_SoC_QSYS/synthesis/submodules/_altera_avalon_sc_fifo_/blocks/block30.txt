The block of code executes based on the condition 'EMPTY_LATENCY > 1'. When this condition is true, the block defined under 'gen_blk14' begins executing. This conditional execution setup is used to configure the latency parameter in the system. The 'generate if' statement is typically used to include or exclude sections of code based on the compile-time constant expressions or parameters. This block aids in dynamically adapting the logic to various system designs or performance demands by adjusting EMPTY_LATENCY parameter.
