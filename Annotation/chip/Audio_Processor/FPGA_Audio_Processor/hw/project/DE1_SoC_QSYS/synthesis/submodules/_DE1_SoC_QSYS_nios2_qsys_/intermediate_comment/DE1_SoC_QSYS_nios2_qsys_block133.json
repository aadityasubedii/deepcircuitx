    "block_comment": "This line of code designates an assigned wire `W_cpuid_reg` with a constant value of 0. Its main function is to establish a fixed reference value throughout the execution of the given module or design. The assign keyword in Verilog guarantees that this assignment is enacted continuously, hence `W_cpuid_reg` will always have a value of 0 in this design."
