    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for setting the 'take_no_action_break_b' signal. It accomplishes this by using a combination of logical AND and NOT operators. If 'enable_action_strobe' is true, 'ir' equals 2'b10 (binary for 2 in Verilog), bit 36 of 'jdo' is set, and bits 35 and 37 of 'jdo' are not set, the 'take_no_action_break_b' signal will be set. Otherwise, it will not be set."
