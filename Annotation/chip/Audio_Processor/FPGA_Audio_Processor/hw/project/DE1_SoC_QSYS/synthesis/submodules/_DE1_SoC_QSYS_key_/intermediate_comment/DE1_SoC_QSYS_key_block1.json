    "block_comment": "This block is a digital edge detector detecting the rising edges in the signal. It works by implementing a simple 1-bit delay line and utilizes a bitwise AND operator along with a bitwise negation operator. When the current input, `d2_data_in`, is high (true) and the delayed input, `~d1_data_in`, is low (false), it indicates a rising edge in the digital signal. This condition is captured by the result, `edge_detect`, turning high (true)."
