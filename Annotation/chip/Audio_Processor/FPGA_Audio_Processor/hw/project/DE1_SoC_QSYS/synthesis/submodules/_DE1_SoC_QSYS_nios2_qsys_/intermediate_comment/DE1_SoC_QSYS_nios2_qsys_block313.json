    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a FIFO register (First In, First Out) that can be cleared or updated on certain conditions. Upon receiving a negative edge on the reset signal (`reset_n`), the FIFO register (`fifo_2`) is cleared to zero. On a positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`), if the enabling signal (`fifo_2_enable`) for the FIFO is asserted, the value of the input multiplexer signal (`fifo_2_mux`) is stored into the FIFO register."
