Module-level comment: 
The DE1_SoC_QSYS_PLAY_BTN_IN module interfaces with the Play button on a DE1_SoC FPGA board. It detects a button press via a rising edge and triggers an interrupt if not masked. Read/Write operations on addressable registers are managed using input ports `chipselect`, `address`, `write_n`, and `writedata`. Output ports `irq` and `readdata` correspond to interrupts and read operations. Internal signals handle tasks such as clock control (`clk_en`), input data management (`data_in`), interrupt masking (`irq_mask`), edge detections (`edge_detect`), and data storages (`d1_data_in`, `d2_data_in`). Various sections of the code handle readdata generation, irq_mask management, irq and edge_capture generation, and data-in propagation.
