This block manages a control signal for enabling/disabling write operations to the 9th position in a FIFO queue. The 'fifo_9_enable' signal is set when certain conditions are met: First, the current write pointer 'fifo_wrptr' equals 9 and there's data to be written ('input_ge1' is true). Alternatively, write operation is enabled if there's space available in the 2nd or 3rd positions and the incremented write pointers 'fifo_wrptr_plus1' or 'fifo_wrptr_plus2' is at the 9th position with respective data inputs 'input_ge2' or 'input_ge3' ready.
