    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is used for tracing/debugging mechanisms where different conditions trigger the 'trace this' signal. The 'trace this' signal (trc_this) is assigned a high level when the 'trace on' signal (trc_on) is high, when both the 'traceon during debug' signal (dbrk_traceon) is high and 'traceoff during debug' (dbrk_traceoff) is low, or when the specific 'trace me during debug' signal (dbrk_traceme) is high. The operator ' | ' denotes the logical OR operation which is used to combine these conditions, and the ' & ' operator denotes the logical AND operation, used to establish sequential conditions."
