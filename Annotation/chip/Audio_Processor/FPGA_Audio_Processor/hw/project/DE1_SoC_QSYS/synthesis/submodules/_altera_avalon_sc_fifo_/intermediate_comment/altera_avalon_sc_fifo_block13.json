    "block_comment": "This block is essentially a synchronous reset and control/status register (CSR) read/write block for a system. Upon a reset, the block initializes the almost full threshold to the maximum FIFO size, resets CSR readdata, the drop_on_error enable, and sets packet mode to 1. Otherwise, the block checks if it's in read or write mode. In read mode, the block sets the CSR read data based on the CSR address, providing details about various system thresholds and levels. In write mode, the defined behaviour changes several system operation parameters such as 'almost_empty_threshold', 'cut_through_threshold', 'drop_on_error_en' based on the input CSR address. The packet mode also adapts itself based on the 'cut_through_threshold'."
