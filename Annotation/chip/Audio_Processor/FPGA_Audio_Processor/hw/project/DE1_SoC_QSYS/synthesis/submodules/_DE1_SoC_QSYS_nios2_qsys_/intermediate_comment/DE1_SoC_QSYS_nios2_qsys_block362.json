    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for the assignment operation of the variable 'is_exception_no_break'. This variable is assigned a single-bit binary value 0. Its purpose can be to maintain or flag a non-exception condition in a certain part of a larger digital system, given the name of the variable. The implementation of this function is done in Verilog as an assign construct, which evaluates the value on the right-hand side of the assign construct and continuously drives the value onto the net on the left-hand side."
