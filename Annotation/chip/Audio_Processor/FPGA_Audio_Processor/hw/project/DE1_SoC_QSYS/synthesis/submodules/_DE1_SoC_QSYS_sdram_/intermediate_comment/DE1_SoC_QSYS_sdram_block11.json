    "block_comment": "This is a reset-controlled state tracking block. It either initiates a reset or tracks a particular state of the system based on the clock's positive edge or the reset signal's negative edge. If the reset is active (reset_n equals 0), the 'init_done' signal is set to 0, indicating a system reset. However, if the reset is not active, the block checks the current state ('i_state') of the system. If 'i_state' equals \"3'b101\", the block sets the 'init_done' signal to 1, indicating that the system initialization is complete."
