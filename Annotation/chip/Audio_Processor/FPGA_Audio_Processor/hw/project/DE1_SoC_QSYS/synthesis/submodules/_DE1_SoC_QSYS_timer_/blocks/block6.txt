The block of code assigns the value of `snap_strobe` based on a logical OR operation between `snap_l_wr_strobe` and `snap_h_wr_strobe`. If either `snap_l_wr_strobe` or `snap_h_wr_strobe` (or both) are true, `snap_strobe` will be set to true; otherwise, it will be false. This signifies that `snap_strobe` acts as a trigger whenever there's a write request on either lower or higher byte of a memory snapshot. The utilized assignment operation signifies combinational logic, reflecting the instant change in the values of the operands.
