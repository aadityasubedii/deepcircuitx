    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a reset and clock-triggered update for the read-enable signal, 'i_read'. Upon receiving a low signal '0' on the reset_n (active-low reset), the block forces 'i_read' to the default high state '1'. Otherwise, it updates 'i_read' with the value of 'i_read_nxt' at every positive edge of the clock signal. This ensures that 'i_read' can be manually reset and/or updated accurately aligning with the system clock."
