    "block_comment": "This block of code performs an Arithmetic Right Shift operation on an address in the program counter. Specifically, it's shifting the bits of `F_pc_plus_one` by 2 places to the left and filling in the vacated positions to the right with zeros. The result is assigned to `F_pcb_plus_four`. This effectively multiplies `F_pc_plus_one` by 4, yielding an address that's four locations higher. This is a common operation in systems where instructions are 4 bytes."
