This block of code controls the memory command signals and selection logic in a memory device. Starting with an always-enabled clock signal, it assigns various memory command signals like chip select (zs_cs_n), row address strobe (zs_ras_n), column address strobe (zs_cas_n), and write enable (zs_we_n) from the memory command inputs (m_cmd). Similarly, it maps the memory address (m_addr), clock enable (clk_en), data input/output (m_data) and Data Output Enable Signal (oe), input mask signal (m_dqm), and bank address (m_bank) to respective outputs. Furthermore, it includes selection logic for active chip select signal using a condition based on a pop signal (f_pop) and a pending signal.
