    "block_comment": "This block of code is a reset and update logic for the variable 'av_ld_waiting_for_data'. When the reset signal 'reset_n' is driven low, this block resets the 'av_ld_waiting_for_data' to zero. In the absence of a reset (when the 'reset_n' is high), the value of 'av_ld_waiting_for_data' is updated at every positive edge of 'clk' with the value of 'av_ld_waiting_for_data_nxt'."
