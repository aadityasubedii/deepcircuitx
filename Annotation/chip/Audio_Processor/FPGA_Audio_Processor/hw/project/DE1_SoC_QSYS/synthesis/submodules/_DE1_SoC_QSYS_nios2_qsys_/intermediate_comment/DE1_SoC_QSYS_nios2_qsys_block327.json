    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to determine whether the FIFO (First In First Out) memory is empty or not. It makes use of a bitwise reduction OR operation (`|`) on the `fifo_cnt` variable, then inverting the result using the negation operator (`~`). If all the bits of `fifo_cnt` are zero indicating that there are no elements in the FIFO, the result of the OR operation will be zero, and the negation will then result in `empty` being true (1)."
