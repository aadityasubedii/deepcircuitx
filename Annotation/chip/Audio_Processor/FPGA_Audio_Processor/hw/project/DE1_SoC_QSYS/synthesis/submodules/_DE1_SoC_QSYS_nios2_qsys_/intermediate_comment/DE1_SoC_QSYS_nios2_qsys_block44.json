    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for updating the value of the 'R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison_nxt' signal in the following clock cycle. It achieves this function by assigning the current value of the 'D_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison' signal to 'R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison_nxt', ensuring thereto that the latter signal holds the same state as the former in the next cycle."
