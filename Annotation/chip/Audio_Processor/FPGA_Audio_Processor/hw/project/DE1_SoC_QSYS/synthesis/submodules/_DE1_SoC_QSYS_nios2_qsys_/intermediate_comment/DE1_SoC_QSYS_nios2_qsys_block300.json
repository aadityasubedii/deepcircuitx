    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a value to the `fifo_6_mux` based on several conditions regarding the write pointer (`fifo_wrptr`), an incremented value of the write pointer (`fifo_wrptr_plus1`), and the validity of three input signals (`itm_valid`, `atm_valid`, `dtm_valid`). Specifically, certain input signals (`itm`, `overflow_pending_atm`, `overflow_pending_dtm`) are used to determine the value of `fifo_6_mux` according to different Boolean conditions, which account for write pointer position and input signal validity. This block efficiently handles multiple conditions for a digital FIFO mux operation."
