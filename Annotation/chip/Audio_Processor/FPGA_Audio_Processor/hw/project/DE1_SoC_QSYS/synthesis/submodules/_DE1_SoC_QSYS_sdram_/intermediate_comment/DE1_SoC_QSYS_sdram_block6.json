    "block_comment": "This block of a Verilog code performs the function of a shift register for read validation under synchronized conditions. On each positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the reset signal, the code block executes. If the reset is active low, it initializes the 'rd_valid' register to zero. If the reset is not active, it performs a left shift on the 'rd_valid' register on every positive edge of the clock and inserts the 'rd_strobe' signal on the rightmost bit while keeping the two bits to the left of it as zeros. This ensures the shift register always maintains a width of 3 bits."
