    "block_comment": "The block assigns an output named `fifo_0_mux` through a chain of conditional assignments. These assignments evaluate certain conditions involving input signals (`itm_valid`, `atm_valid`, `dtm_valid`, `ge2_free`), a write pointer (`fifo_wrptr`), and a modified write pointer (`fifo_wrptr_plus1`). If the conditions are true, `fifo_0_mux` will be assigned with different conditional values (`itm`, `overflow_pending_atm`, `overflow_pending_dtm`). If no conditions are met, default assignment is `overflow_pending_dtm`."
