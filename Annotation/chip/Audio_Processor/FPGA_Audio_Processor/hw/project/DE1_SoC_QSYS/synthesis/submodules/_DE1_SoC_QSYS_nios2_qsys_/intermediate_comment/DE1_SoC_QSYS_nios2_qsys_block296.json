    "block_comment": "This code block controls the enabling of an 8-level FIFO. The 'fifo_8_enable' signal is given by a combinational circuit made up of logical AND and OR operations. Write operation to this 8-bit FIFO is enabled if any one of three conditions is satisfied: (1) when the write pointer is at the 8th position and a condition called 'input_ge1' is true, (2) when the variable 'ge2_free' is true and both the incremented write pointer is at the 8th position and 'input_ge2' is true and (3) when 'ge3_free' is true and both the double incremented write pointer is at the 8th position and 'input_ge3' is true."
