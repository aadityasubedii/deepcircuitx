    "block_comment": "This code block performs the function of a non-blocking assignment. It forwards the current state of the `D_ctrl_shift_logical` signal to the `R_ctrl_shift_logical_nxt` signal at the next positive edge of the clock cycle. This implementation assures sequential execution in synthesizable designs, ensuring that changes in `D_ctrl_shift_logical` within a given clock cycle do not immediately propagate to `R_ctrl_shift_logical_nxt`. This mechanism is often used in state machine designs or any other system where sequential logic is important."
