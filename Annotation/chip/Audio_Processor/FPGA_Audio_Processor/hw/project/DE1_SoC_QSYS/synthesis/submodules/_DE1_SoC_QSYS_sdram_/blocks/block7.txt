This block assigns the value of `rd_strobe` based on whether the lowest three bits of the `m_cmd` signal are binary `101` (or decimal `5`). This assignment takes place every simulation time unit. When the least significant three bits of `m_cmd` equals to `5`, `rd_strobe` will be true, otherwise, it will be false.
