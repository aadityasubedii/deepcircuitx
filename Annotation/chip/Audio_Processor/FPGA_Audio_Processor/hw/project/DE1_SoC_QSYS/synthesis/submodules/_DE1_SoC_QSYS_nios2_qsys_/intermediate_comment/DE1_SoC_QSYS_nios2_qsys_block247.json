    "block_comment": "This Verilog block describes a part of a sequential logic circuit. The logic is controlled by the positive-edge (rising edge) of the clock signal \"clk\" or the negative-edge (falling edge) of the reset signal \"jrst_n\". When \"jrst_n\" is '0' (indicating a reset trigger), the \"address\" register is reset to '0'. On the other hand, when there's a clock edge and no reset trigger, the block assigns the value from \"address_nxt\" to the \"address\" register, thus essentially performing an operation for updating the contents of the address register."
