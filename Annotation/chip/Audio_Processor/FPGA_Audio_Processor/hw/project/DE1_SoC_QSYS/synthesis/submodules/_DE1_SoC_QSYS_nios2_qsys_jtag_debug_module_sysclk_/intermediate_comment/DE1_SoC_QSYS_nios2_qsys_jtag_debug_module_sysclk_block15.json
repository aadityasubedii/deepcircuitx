    "block_comment": "The block generates synchronized signals based on the clock edges. Upon each positive clock edge, 'sync2_udr' is updated with 'sync_udr' and 'update_jdo_strobe' is generated by bitwise AND operation of 'sync_udr' and negation of 'sync2_udr'. The 'enable_action_strobe' signal is made equal to 'update_jdo_strobe'. Similarly, 'sync2_uir' is updated with 'sync_uir', and 'jxuir' is derived by a bitwise AND operation between 'sync_uir' and the inverse of 'sync2_uir'."
