Comment: 
This block of code controls reset and break operations on a system using a JTAG interface. The block is activated on the rising edge of the clock signal or the falling edge of the 'jrst_n' signal. If 'jrst_n' is 0, it deactivates the reset and break requests. If 'take_action_ocimem_a' is true, it sets the reset request and break flags based on the respective bits in the 'jdo' array, effectively utilising JTAG interface to control the reset and break operations. The 'resetlatch' is cleared if the 24th bit of 'jdo' is high. If 'reset_sync' signal is true, it latches the reset and sets the 'jtag_break' signal to the value of 'break_on_reset'. If a debug request is made and not yet acknowledged and 'break_on_reset' is true, the 'jtag_break' signal is activated.
