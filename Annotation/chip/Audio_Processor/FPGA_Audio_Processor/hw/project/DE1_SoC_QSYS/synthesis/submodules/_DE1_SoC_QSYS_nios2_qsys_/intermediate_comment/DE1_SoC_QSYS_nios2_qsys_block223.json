    "block_comment": "This block of code is a priority encoder designed to assign a specific value to the 'F_iw' signal based on the conditions met. First, it checks if the 'hbreak_req' signal is active, if so it assigns the value 4040762 to 'F_iw'. If not, it checks if a constant signal '1'b0' is true, in which case it assigns the value 127034 to 'F_iw'. If still unmet, it then evaluates the 'intr_req' signal and assigns the value 3926074 if true. If none of these conditions are true, 'F_iw' remains at its initial value 'F_av_iw'."
