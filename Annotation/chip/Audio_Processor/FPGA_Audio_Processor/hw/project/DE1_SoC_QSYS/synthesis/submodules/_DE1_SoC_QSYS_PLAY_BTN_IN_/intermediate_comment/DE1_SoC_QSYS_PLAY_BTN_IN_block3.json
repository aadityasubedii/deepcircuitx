    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as an edge detector, capturing and resetting the edge capture flag based on the clock's state and any detected edges. Implementation-wise, the block is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset flag. When the reset is active-low, it clears the edge capture flag. While the clock is enabled, if the write strobe for edge capture is active, the edge capture flag is cleared again. However, if an edge is detected, the edge capture health, indicated as '-1', is updated."
