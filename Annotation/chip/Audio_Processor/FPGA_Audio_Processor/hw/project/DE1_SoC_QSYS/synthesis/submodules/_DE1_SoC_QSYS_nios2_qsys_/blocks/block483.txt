Comment: 
This block of code manages register addressing and write operations in Verilog. The code initially checks if the current address is either 9'h100 or 9'h101, and assigns the boolean result to `oci_reg_00_addressed` and `oci_reg_01_addressed` respectively. Whenever both a write operation and a debug access operation are triggered, the code activates a `write_strobe`. `take_action_ocireg` and `take_action_oci_intr_mask_reg` are triggered when their respective registers are addressed and `write_strobe` is active. The last three lines set `ocireg_ers`, `ocireg_mrs`, and `ocireg_sstep` variables proportionate to the lower bits of `writedata`.
