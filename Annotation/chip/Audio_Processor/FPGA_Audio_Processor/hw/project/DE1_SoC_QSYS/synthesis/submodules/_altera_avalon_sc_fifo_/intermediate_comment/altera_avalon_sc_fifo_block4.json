    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for handling error conditions in packet transmission. It assigns a Boolean flag, drop_on_error, that signals when a data packet should be dropped due to an error. The conditions for dropping a packet are defined by the conjunction of four elements: the drop_on_error_en switch, if an error is detected within the packet (error_in_pkt), if there is an error in the incoming packet (in_pkt_error), and if the end of the incoming packet has arrived (in_pkt_eop_arrive). When these four conditions are simultaneously true, the packet will be dropped."
