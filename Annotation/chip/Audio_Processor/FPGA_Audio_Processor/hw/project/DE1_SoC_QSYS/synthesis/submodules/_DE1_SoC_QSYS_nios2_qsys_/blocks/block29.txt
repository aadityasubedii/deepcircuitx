Comment: 
This line of code is handling the state transition in a finite state machine (FSM). Specifically, it is assigning the next state of the control state ('R_ctrl_st_nxt') to be the current control state ('D_ctrl_st'). In other words, it signifies that the control state remains unchanged in the next cycle.
