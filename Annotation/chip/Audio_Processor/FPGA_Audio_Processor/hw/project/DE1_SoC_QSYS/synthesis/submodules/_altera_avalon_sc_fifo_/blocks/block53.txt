This block of code is responsible for handling memory write and read operations of a buffer. Upon each positive edge of the clock, if the input is valid and ready, the code writes the input payload into the location pointed by the write pointer (wr_ptr) in memory. Simultaneously, it also reads data from the memory location pointed by the read pointer (mem_rd_ptr) and assigns it to the variable internal_out_payload.
