[Function of the block] This block of code is used for loading a predetermined set of test values into the memory array for simulation purposes. [Implementation details of the block] The `$readmemh` system function is being used to read in hexadecimal values from the file `"DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component.dat"` and store them into `mem_array`. This is done at the start of a simulation (`initial` block) to provide a predefined state of the memory array for testing the system.
