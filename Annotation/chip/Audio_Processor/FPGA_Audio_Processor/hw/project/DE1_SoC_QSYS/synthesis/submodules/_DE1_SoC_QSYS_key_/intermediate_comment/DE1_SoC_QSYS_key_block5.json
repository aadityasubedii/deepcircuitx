    "block_comment": "This block functions as an edge capture mechanism, specifically for the second bit. The block's behavior is dictated by the incoming clock signal or the negative edge of the reset signal. On the negative edge of the reset signal, the second bit of the `edge_capture` array is set to 0. If the reset signal is not active and the clock is enabled (`clk_en`), the block proceeds to evaluate the input `edge_capture_wr_strobe` and `edge_detect[1]`. If `edge_capture_wr_strobe` is high, `edge_capture[1]` is also reset to 0. Otherwise, if the second bit of `edge_detect` is high, the second bit of the `edge_capture` array is set to -1."
