    "block_comment": "This block of code increments the write pointer of a FIFO queue. Specifically, it uses the 'assign' keyword in Verilog to continuously assign the value of 'fifo_wrptr + 1' to 'fifo_wrptr_plus1', thus ensuring that 'fifo_wrptr_plus1' always represents the next position in the queue where new data should be written."
