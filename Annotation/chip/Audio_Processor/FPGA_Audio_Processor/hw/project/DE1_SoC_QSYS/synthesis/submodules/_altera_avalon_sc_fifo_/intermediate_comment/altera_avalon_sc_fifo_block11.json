    "block_comment": "This line of code sets the maximum size for a FIFO memory. The block operates by assigning the value of FIFO_DEPTH (which represents the total capacity of the FIFO memory) minus one to the variable max_fifo_size, effectively setting the maximum storage limit for the FIFO. This subtract operation accounts for the always reserved one slot in the FIFO memory to avoid data overwrite conflicts."
