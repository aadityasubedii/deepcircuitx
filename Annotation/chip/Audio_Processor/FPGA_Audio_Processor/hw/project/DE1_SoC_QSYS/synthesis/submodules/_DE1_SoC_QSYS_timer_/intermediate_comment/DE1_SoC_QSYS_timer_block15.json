    "block_comment": "This block of code is assigned to manage the triggering of interrupts. The interrupt (irq) is triggered when both a timeout event has occurred (timeout_occurred) and the interrupt control is enabled (control_interrupt_enable). These two conditions are linked with a bitwise AND operation, ensuring that the interrupt will only be set if both conditions are true simultaneously."
