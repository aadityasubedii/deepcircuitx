The block of code is used to perform a simple reset functionality. More specifically, it assigns signal 'jrst_n' the same value as 'reset_n'. This is achieved using the 'assign' keyword, a continuous assignment statement in Verilog that keeps 'jrst_n' always equal to 'reset_n'. This action will continue until either of the signals is updated.
