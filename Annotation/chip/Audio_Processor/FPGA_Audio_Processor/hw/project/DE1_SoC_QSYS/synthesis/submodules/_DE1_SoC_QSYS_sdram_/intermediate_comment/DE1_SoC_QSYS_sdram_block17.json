    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is responsible for writing data into two memory locations on the positive edge of the clock signal if the write signal is active and the memory is not full. Depending on the address (either 0 or 1) specified during the write operation, the data will be written into either the `entry_0` or `entry_1` memory slot. The `case` control structure is used to determine the precise memory location for the write operation based on the `wr_address` value."
