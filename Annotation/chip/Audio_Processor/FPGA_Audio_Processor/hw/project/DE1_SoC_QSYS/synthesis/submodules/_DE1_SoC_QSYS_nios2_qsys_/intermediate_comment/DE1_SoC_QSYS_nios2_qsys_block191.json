    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a flexible bitwise logic operator. Depending on the value of 'R_logic_op', the output 'E_logic_result' is the result of one of four bitwise operations ('NOT OR', 'AND', 'OR', 'XOR') performed on the input variables 'E_src1' and 'E_src2'. It uses conditional ternary logic to assign 'E_logic_result', performing the chosen operation based on the specified 'R_logic_op'. If 'R_logic_op' is '00', \u2018NOT OR\u2019 operation is performed; if it's '01', \u2018AND\u2019 operation is performed; '10' triggers the 'OR' operation, and any other value executes 'XOR'."
