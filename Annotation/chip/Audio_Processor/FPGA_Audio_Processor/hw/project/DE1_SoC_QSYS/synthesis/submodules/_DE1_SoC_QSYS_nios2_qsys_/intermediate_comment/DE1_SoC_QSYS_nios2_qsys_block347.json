    "block_comment": "This Verilog block manages the condition-based modification of a control register (trc_ctrl_reg) under different clock conditions. On a negative edge of 'jrst_n', it resets all registers to 0. On a positive clock edge, if 'take_action_tracectrl' is high, 'trc_ctrl_reg' values are updated from 'jdo' bit values and under certain never true conditions ('if (0)'), there are provisions to add more 'jdo' bits into the control register. If 'xbrk_wrap_traceoff' is high, it resets the first two bits of 'trc_ctrl_reg'. When 'dbrk_traceoff' or 'xbrk_traceoff' is high, the second register bit is turned off. The second register bit is turned on when the first bit is high and either 'dbrk_traceon' or 'xbrk_traceon' is high."
