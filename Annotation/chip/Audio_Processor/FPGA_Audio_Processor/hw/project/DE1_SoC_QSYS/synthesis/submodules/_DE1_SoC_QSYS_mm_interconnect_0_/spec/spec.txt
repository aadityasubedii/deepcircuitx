Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_mm_interconnect_0. Module specification: This module implements a memory-mapped interconnect fabric for a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, likely for the DE1-SoC development board. It manages communication between various master and slave components in the system, handling address decoding, data routing, and protocol conversion. The module has numerous input and output ports, including clock and reset signals, as well as data and control signals for multiple master and slave interfaces. Key input ports include clock (pll_outclk0_clk), reset signals, and master interface signals (e.g., nios2_qsys_data_master_address). Output ports include slave interface signals (e.g., jtag_uart_avalon_jtag_slave_address) and various response signals. Internally, the module uses a wide
