The block initializes output signals for a Synchronous Dynamic RAM (SDRAM) using input from a Zigbee (ZB) controller. Utilizing multiple assignments, the values of the ZB signals are assigned to corresponding SDRAM signals. Various control signals such as cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n, dqm, a, cmd_code, CODE and the address and bank address signals (a and ba) are specified. Also, the command code (cmd_code) is encoded as a concatenation of the ras_n, cas_n, and we_n signals. At the end, the CODE is given as a hexadecimal value conditionally based on the logical AND result of cs_n signal.
