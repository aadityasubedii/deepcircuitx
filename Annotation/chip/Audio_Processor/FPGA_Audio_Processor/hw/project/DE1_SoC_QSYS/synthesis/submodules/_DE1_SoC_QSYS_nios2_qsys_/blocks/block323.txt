This block of code represents a FIFO (First In First Out) memory structure control logic. During a negative trigger of 'jrst_n', the FIFO read and write pointers are reset to zero and 'overflow_pending' is set. On a positive edge of the clock, the write pointer 'fifo_wrptr' and the count 'fifo_cnt' are increased by their respective increment values. The read pointer 'fifo_rdptr' advances by one if the FIFO is not empty. The 'overflow_pending' bit is set or unset based on the conditions tied with the input queue status and the data transfer mode validations.
