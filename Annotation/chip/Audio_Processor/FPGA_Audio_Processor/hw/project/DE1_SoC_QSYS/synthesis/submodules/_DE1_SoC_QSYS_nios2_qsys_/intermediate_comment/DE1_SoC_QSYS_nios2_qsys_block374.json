    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code assigns a constant low value (0) to the signal `dbrk3_traceme`. This means that the signal `dbrk3_traceme` is constantly low in this particular block of code and is not influenced by any other signals or conditions in the RTL code unless stated otherwise in another part of the code. This could be a default value or it may be a part of the design where this signal does not need to change its state."
