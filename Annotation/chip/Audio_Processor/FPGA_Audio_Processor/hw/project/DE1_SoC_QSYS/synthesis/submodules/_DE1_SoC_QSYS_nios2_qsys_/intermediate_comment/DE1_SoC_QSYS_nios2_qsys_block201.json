    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing the status of the 'E_new_inst' signal, which is based on the 'clk' and 'reset_n' input signals. In the event of a falling edge detection on 'reset_n', the 'E_new_inst' signal is reset to low. On the other hand, during a rising edge of 'clk', the 'E_new_inst' signal is assigned the value of 'R_valid'. Hence, it emphasizes on synchronizing the state of 'E_new_inst' with the current system clock cycle while allowing active-low reset functionality."
