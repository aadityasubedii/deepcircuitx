    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous process that manages the `force_reload` signal based on system reset and clock enable signals. On a negative edge of `reset_n`, it resets the `force_reload` signal to zero, ensuring the system is in a known state after a reset. If `reset_n` isn't triggered, and `clk_en` (clock enable) signal is high, `force_reload` is driven by a logical OR operation between `period_h_wr_strobe` and `period_l_wr_strobe` on the rising edge of the system clock - meaning that `force_reload` will be set whenever either of these strobe signals is asserted."
