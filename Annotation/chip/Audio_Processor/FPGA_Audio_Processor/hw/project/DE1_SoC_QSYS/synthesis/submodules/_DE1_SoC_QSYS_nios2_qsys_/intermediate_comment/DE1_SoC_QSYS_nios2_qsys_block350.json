    "block_comment": "This Verilog block's functionality is to create a two-bit wide variable called `dct_code`. This value is constructed from the elements `is_cond_dct` and `dct_is_taken`. In terms of implementation details, the `assign` keyword is used here which means this statement is continuously driven. The brackets `{}` are used to concatenate the two single-bit signals (`is_cond_dct` and `dct_is_taken`) into one two-bit wide signal `dct_code`."
