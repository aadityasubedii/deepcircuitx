DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module: This module behaves as the memory storage for the tested system. It has a 16-bit data input and output interface (named 'data' and 'q'), read and write addresses inputs ('rdaddress' and 'wraddress'), and controls such as 'rdclken', 'wrclock', and 'wren' that enable read and write operations, respectively. The module uses an array 'mem_array' as an internal memory, which gets its initial content from the file 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component.dat'.\n\n2. DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component: This module is a synthesizable test component for simulating accesses to SDRAM. It connects to the SDRAM through the io port 'zs_dq' and various control lines such as 'zs_cke' (clock enable), 'zs_cs_n' (chip select), 'zs_ras_n' (row address strobe), 'zs_cas_n' (column address strobe), and 'zs_we_n' (write enable). Inside the module, a sub-component of type 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module' is instantiated to perform the memory-related operations. The module also handles read/write masking, address translations, as well as simulating latency for memory access."
