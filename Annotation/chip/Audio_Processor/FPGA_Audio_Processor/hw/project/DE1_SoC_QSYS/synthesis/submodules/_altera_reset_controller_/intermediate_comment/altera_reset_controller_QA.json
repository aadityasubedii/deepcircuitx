Various input parameters and local parameters allow flexibility in its configuration, allowing it to adapt to different system constraints. The module accepts multiple reset signals and reset request signals. It uses these inputs along with its internal configuration to generate an output reset signal and reset request signal. The module further includes inbuilt synchronizers to synchronize these reset signals with a clock to prevent metastability. It also provides different mechanisms to control the assertion and deassertion of the reset signal based on the various parameters provided."

They are expected to be external reset signals that should restart the state machines or counters etc. in hardware.\n2. reset_req_in0 to reset_req_in15: These are the reset requests. When a request is made, and if the resource is not occupied already by a higher priority reset request, the output reset signal will be asserted immediately, and de-asserted after the requisite number of wait intervals, dictated by the module's parameters.\n3. clk: The clock input, which is used to synchronize the actions of the system.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. reset_out: This is the reset output signal. It corresponds to the merged reset signal after accounting for reset requests and applying needed synchronization. \n2. reset_req: This is the reset request output signal. This is determined by the earliest of reset requests and some conditions, so that the final output reset signal resets as quickly as possible after a request arrives.\n\nExplanation: In the Verilog module, the reset_in and reset_req_in inputs are handled inside the module to give reset_out and reset_req signals. Inputs are synchronized, potentially delayed, and then merged to give just one output reset and one reset request signal. Reset controller makes sure that reset signals behave as expected even when they arrive unexpectedly or very close to the clock edge."
