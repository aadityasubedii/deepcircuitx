Module-level comment: This module, altera_reset_synchronizer, synchronizes an asynchronous reset signal with a system clock. It uses a shift chain called altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain, whose size is determined by a parameter "DEPTH", to align the reset signal "reset_in" with the system clock "clk". The shift process is advanced on the positive edge of the clock, and optionally also on the positive edge of the reset signal, controlled by the "ASYNC_RESET" parameter. The synchronized reset signal is then provided as "reset_out", making it suitable for use in downstream logic.
