    "block_comment": "This block implements a multiplexer for a FIFO (First In, First Out) queue at index 10. The multiplexer determines what data is assigned to 'fifo_10_mux' under various conditions. If 'itm_valid' is true and write pointer 'fifo_wrptr' is at index '10', 'itm' is assigned, following similar rules for 'atm_valid' and 'dtm_valid'. If 'fifo_wrptr_plus1' is at index 10 and both 'itm_valid' and 'atm_valid' are true and 'ge2_free' is available (checked using bitwise AND), 'overflow_pending_atm' is selected. If 'itm_valid' and 'dtm_valid' are true, 'overflow_pending_dtm' is selected. The same goes for 'atm_valid' and 'dtm_valid'. If none of these conditions are met, 'fifo_10_mux' gets 'overflow_pending_dtm'."
