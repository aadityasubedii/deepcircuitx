    "block_comment": "The block handles reset and write requests in a synchronous manner. On a clock's positive edge or a reset's negative edge, it checks if the reset is low. If it is, no operations are performed. Then, if the \"W_valid\" signal is high and \"R_wr_dst_reg\" signal is true, it checks if there's any unknown state in \"W_wr_data\". A warning message is printed with the time of detection whenever an unknown state is found in \"W_wr_data\"."
