    "block_comment": "This block of code is a control signal assignment in Verilog to decide when to choose immediate values as one of the sources for an operation. It does this by logically OR-ing various operation signals from an instruction. Specifically, if any operation that requires an immediate value as one of its inputs is active (signaled as high), the `D_ctrl_src2_choose_imm` signal will be set high. The operations range from arithmetic and bitwise operations, jump instruction, register operations, comparison operations to various loads and stores operations, which all require immediate values."
