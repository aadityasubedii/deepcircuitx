    "block_comment": "This block is a resettable counter in a synchronous design. The system state changes positively with the edge of the clock (posedge clk) or negatively with the edge of the reset signal (negedge reset_n). If the reset signal is low (reset_n == 0), the counter (E_shift_rot_cnt) resets to 0. Otherwise, the counter is updated with the value of E_shift_rot_cnt_nxt at every clock cycle.\n"
