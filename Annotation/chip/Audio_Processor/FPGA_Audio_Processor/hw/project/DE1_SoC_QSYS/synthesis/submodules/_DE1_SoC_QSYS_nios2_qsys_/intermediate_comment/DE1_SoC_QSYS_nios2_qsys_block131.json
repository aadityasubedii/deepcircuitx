    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `W_wr_data_non_zero` to `W_wr_data`. It's a simple assignment operation in Verilog, which means that whenever there's a change in `W_wr_data_non_zero`, `W_wr_data` will immediately take on the new value. Any changes to `W_wr_data_non_zero` will 'propagate' to `W_wr_data` instantly."
