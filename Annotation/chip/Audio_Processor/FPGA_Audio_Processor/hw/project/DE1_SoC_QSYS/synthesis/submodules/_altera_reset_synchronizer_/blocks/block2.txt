This block of code is for assign operation usually used in assigning signals. Specifically, it assigns the "altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out" to "reset_out". It is a typical assign statement in Verilog which assigns the right-hand side expression or connection to the left-hand side wire "reset_out". The right hand side seems to be an internal output signal from an Altera reset synchronizer chain, and hence the block effectively uses this signal to control or drive the wire "reset_out".
