    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sysid_qsys module acts as a system identifier, translating the 'address' input to a system ID output ('readdata'). It operates synchronously with 'clock' signals and allows resetting via 'reset_n'. If the 'address' is non-zero, 'readdata' is assigned the value 1494305126, indicating a specific system ID, else it defaults to 0. This assignment is achieved via a conditional operator wired to 'readdata'."
