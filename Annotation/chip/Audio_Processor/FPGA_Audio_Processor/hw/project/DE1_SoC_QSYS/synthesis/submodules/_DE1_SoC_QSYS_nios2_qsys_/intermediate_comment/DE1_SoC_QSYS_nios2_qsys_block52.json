    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling a specific branch behavior in a hardware system (R_ctrl_br_uncond). It acts as a flip-flop responding to changes on the edge of the clock signal (clk) or negative edge of reset signal (reset_n). If the reset_n signal is 0, the control branch (R_ctrl_br_uncond) is reset to 0. If not (meaning that the system is not in reset), and when the enable signal (R_en) is high, the control branch updates its value to the next state (R_ctrl_br_uncond_nxt) on the rising edge of the clock signal."
