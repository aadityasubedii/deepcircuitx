    "block_comment": "This block acts as a logical OR gate, determining if any of the specified xbrk_goto1_hit signals are activated. In its implementation, it uses the bitwise OR operation (represented by the '|') to collectively examine the state of the named xbrk_goto1_hit signals (xbrk0_goto1_hit, xbrk1_goto1_hit, xbrk2_goto1_hit, and xbrk3_goto1_hit). The output, xbrk_goto1_hit, is high (1) if any one or more of the inputs are high (1). If all inputs are low (0), the output will be low (0)."
