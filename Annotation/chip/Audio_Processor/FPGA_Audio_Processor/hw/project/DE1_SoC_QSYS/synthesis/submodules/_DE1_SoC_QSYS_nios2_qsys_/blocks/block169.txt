This line of code assigns the memory address for data storage. It specifically directs the value of 'W_mem_baddr' (which represents the block address within the memory system) to 'd_address'. This is done through the 'assign' statement in Verilog, which continuously assigns the value of the right-hand side variable to the left-hand side variable, keeping it updated throughout the execution.
