    "spec": "Module Name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer.\n\nModule Specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer is a Verilog module designed around functionality of a programmable timer or counter. Its main task is to start, run, stop, or reload the internal counter based on external input signals. Additionally, it can generate an interrupt request when the count reaches zero. It offers flexibility for programming desired interval or count, interrupt condition, continuous run setting, and other configurations through the control registers.\n\nThe module utilizes several input ports like 'address' (3-bit input used for internal register selection), 'chipselect' (to select module for communication), 'clk' (system clock signal), 'reset_n'  (active low reset signal), 'write_n'  (active low write signal), and 'writedata' (16-bit data input). Its output ports are 'irq' (interrupt request signal upon reaching zero count) and 'readdata' (16-bit data readout).\n\nInternally, it incorporates a multitude of signals such as 'counter_load_value' (the value from where the counter starts counting downwards), 'internal_counter' (the actual down counter), 'counter_is_running' (indicates if counter is running), 'counter_is_zero' (indicates if counter has reached zero), etc. These signals work behind the scenes, managing the counter's behavior by responding to changes in inputs and modifying outputs correspondingly.\n\nThis module's main code body consists of blocks responsible for different operations like observing for reset or clock signals, handling control register write strobe, managing counter running state and transitions, dealing with timeout events and interrupt request generation, handling data read and write operations, and managing the snap value of the counter. All these together accomplish the module's targeted operation.",

The counter can be started, stopped, and reloaded by external signals. Additionally, it has a feature to generate an interrupt request (irq).

Its main task is to start, run, stop, or reload the internal counter based on external input signals. Additionally, it can generate an interrupt request when the count reaches zero. It offers flexibility for programming desired interval or count, interrupt condition, continuous run setting, and other configurations through the control registers.\n\nThe module utilizes several input ports like 'address' (3-bit input used for internal register selection), 'chipselect' (to select module for communication), 'clk' (system clock signal), 'reset_n'  (active low reset signal), 'write_n'  (active low write signal), and 'writedata' (16-bit data input). Its output ports are 'irq' (interrupt request signal upon reaching zero count) and 'readdata' (16-bit data readout).\n\nInternally, it incorporates a multitude of signals such as 'counter_load_value' (the value from where the counter starts counting downwards), 'internal_counter' (the actual down counter), 'counter_is_running' (indicates if counter is running), 'counter_is_zero' (indicates if counter has reached zero), etc. These signals work behind the scenes, managing the counter's behavior by responding to changes in inputs and modifying outputs correspondingly.\n\nThis module's main code body consists of blocks responsible for different operations like observing for reset or clock signals, handling control register write strobe, managing counter running state and transitions, dealing with timeout events and interrupt request generation, handling data read and write operations, and managing the snap value of the counter. All these together accomplish the module's targeted operation."
