    "block_comment": "The given block of code is used to fetch the second least significant bit from the `input_tm_cnt` variable and assign it to the `input_ge2` variable. This function is achieved by using the bit-select capability of Verilog, where `input_tm_cnt[1]` refers to the second bit (counting starts from 0) of the `input_tm_cnt` variable."
