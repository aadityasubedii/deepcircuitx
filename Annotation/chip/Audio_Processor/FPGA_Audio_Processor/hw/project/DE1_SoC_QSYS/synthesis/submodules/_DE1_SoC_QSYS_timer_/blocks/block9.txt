Comment: 
This block of code functions to manage the value of 'period_h_register' bit based on certain signal conditions. When the negative edge of 'reset_n' appears, 'period_h_register' is reset to the value '2'. Otherwise, when the clock signal ('clk') has a positive edge and 'period_h_wr_strobe' is enabled (or set to true), 'period_h_register' is updated with the value of 'writedata'. The entire operation is synchronous to the clock event.
