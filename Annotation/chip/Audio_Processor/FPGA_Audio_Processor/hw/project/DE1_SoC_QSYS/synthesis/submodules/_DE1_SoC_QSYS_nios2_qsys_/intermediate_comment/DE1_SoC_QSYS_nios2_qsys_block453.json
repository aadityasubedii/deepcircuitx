    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for constant assignment. It's assigning a constant value of zero to the identifier 'xbrk0_toff_hit'. This is done using the assign keyword, which sets the value of the target wire or reg outside of an always or initial block. It is beneficial for parameterizing modules and it mainly helps in simplifying the code."
