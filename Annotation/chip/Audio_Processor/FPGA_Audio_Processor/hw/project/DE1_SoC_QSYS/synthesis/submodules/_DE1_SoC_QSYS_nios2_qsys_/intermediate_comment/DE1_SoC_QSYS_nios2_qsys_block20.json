    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of the signal 'D_ctrl_ignore_dst' to signal 'R_ctrl_ignore_dst_nxt'. The usage of the assign keyword indicates that this is a continuous assignment in Verilog aimed at duplicating the values from one wire to another wire. The wire 'R_ctrl_ignore_dst_nxt' is meant to mirror or follow the changes in 'D_ctrl_ignore_dst' at all times."
