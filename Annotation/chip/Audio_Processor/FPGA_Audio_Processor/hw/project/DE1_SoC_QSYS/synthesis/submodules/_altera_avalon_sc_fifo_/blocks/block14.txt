The block initializes and configures a hardware FIFO buffer with a depth defined by FIFO_DEPTH, when the USE_STORE_FORWARD parameter is enabled. In this implementation, the 'max_fifo_size' is assigned the value of the FIFO depth minus one to correctly represent the maximum index of the FIFO. The operation of this logic is synchronized with the rising edge of the system clock 'clk', or the positive edge of a reset signal, making it suitable for synchronous systems.
