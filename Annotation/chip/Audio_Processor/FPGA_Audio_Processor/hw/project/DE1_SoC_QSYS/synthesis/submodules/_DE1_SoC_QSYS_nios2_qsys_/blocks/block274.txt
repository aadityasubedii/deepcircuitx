Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles the reset and enable operations for the FIFO memory element with identifier 'fifo_13'. When the ancestral statement (a clock edge or a reset signal) becomes active, the block first checks if reset_n equals 0, indicating a reset operation. In the event of a reset, 'fifo_13' is set to 0, effectively emptying the memory element. Alternatively, if 'fifo_13' is enabled (which will be true if the reset_n is not 0), the block sets 'fifo_13' to the value of 'fifo_13_mux', which represents either the input for write operation or the output of read operation.
