    "block_comment": "This block represents a flip-flop which either resets or updates the return address of a control signal in a digital circuit. At the negative edge of the 'reset_n' signal or at the positive edge of the 'clk' signal, the logic checks if the 'reset_n' signal is LOW; if so, the return address 'R_ctrl_retaddr' is reset to zero. But if the 'reset_n' is not LOW - meaning the circuit is not in a reset state, it checks 'R_en' signal, and if that is HIGH, the return address is updated with the value of 'R_ctrl_retaddr_nxt'."
