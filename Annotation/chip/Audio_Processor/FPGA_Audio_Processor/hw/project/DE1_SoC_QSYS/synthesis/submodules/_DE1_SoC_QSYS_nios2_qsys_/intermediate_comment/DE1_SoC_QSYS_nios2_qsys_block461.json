    "block_comment": "This block of code is a state machine controller for a trigger event. It responds to both triggering and resetting conditions in a synchronous digital system. When the negative edge reset signal is detected, the trigger state is cleared, allowing for immediate stopping or resetting of the system. Meanwhile, the machine checks for either 'trigger_state_1' with a conditional 'xbrk_goto0' or 'dbrk_goto0' or 'trigger_state_0' with a conditional 'xbrk_goto1' or 'dbrk_goto1', and based on these checks, it resets or de-asserts the trigger state respectively. The logic for changing the states is implemented using bitwise AND and OR operations."
