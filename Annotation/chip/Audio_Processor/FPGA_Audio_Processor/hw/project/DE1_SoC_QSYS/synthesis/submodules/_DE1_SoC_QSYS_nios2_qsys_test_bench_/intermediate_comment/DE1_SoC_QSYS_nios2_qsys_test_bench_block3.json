    "block_comment": "The block of code monitors the status of a reset or read signal in a digital system. When the reset signal is low, no action is taken. However, when a read signal is detected and a wait request is not active, the block checks if the read data is undefined ('x'). If so, it logs an error message and halts the system to prevent further propagation of undefined values. This implementation is a simple yet effective way of handling error states in a digital communication system."
