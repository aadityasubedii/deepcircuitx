Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sync_in. 

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sync_in is a Verilog module designed to manage and synchronize data inputs inside a hardware system. Its main functionality includes data input processing, edge detection, interrupt request handling, and read/write operations. 

The module has seven input ports: 'address' (a 2-bit port for addressing during read and write operations), 'chipselect' (enables the chip for operations), 'clk' (coordinates the operations), 'in_port' (serves as the primary data input), 'reset_n' (used for initialization or reset of the chip), 'write_n' (controls when write operations occur), and 'writedata' (a 32-bit port for the data to be written). 

There are two output ports: 'irq' (interrupt request, which when asserts, leads to the interruption of the current task and execution of an interrupt handler), and 'readdata' (a 32-bit port for transferring data read back from the module). 

The module also incorporates several internal signals, including 'clk_en', 'd1_data_in', 'd2_data_in', 'data_in', 'edge_capture', 'edge_capture_wr_strobe', 'edge_detect', 'irq_mask', 'read_mux_out', which execute essential functionalities as edge detection, interrupt masking, read/write operations following the clock signal, and interrupt handling.

The code is structured into different blocks, each serving specific functions, such as blocks for initializing or resetting operations, handling read/write operations depending on clock and address inputs, detecting change in data input, handling interrupt requests, and controlling different operations based on the rising edge of the clock signal or the falling edge of the reset signal. In summary, this module provides a cohesive structure for managing complex data inputs and synchronization operations in hardware systems.
