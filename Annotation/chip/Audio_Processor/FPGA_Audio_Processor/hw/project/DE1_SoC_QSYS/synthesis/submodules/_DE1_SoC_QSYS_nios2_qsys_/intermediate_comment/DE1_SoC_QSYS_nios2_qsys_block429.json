    "block_comment": "This code block is a logical OR operation on four signals, xbrk0_toff_hit, xbrk1_toff_hit, xbrk2_toff_hit, and xbrk3_toff_hit, to determine the xbrk_toff_hit signal state. Using the assign keyword, it continuously evaluates the right-hand side expression and assigns the results to the left-hand side. If any of the four input signals (`xbrk0_toff_hit`, `xbrk1_toff_hit`, `xbrk2_toff_hit`, `xbrk3_toff_hit`) is high, the output signal `xbrk_toff_hit` will become high. This is how the block achieves its functionality."
