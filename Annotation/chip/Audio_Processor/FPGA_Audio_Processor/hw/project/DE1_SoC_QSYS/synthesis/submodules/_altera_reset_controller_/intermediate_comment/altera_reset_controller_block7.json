    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is functioning as a level-sensitive latch. It is responsible for propagating the states of 'reset_out_pre2' and 'reset_req_pre' to 'reset_out' and 'reset_req' respectively. The block uses procedural always block to achieve this, which gets triggered upon any changes in the inputs due to the usage of sensitivity list wildcard '@*'."
