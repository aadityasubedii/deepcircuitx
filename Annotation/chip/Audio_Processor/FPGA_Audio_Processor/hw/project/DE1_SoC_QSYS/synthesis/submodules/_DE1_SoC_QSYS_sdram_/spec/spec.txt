Module Name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_input_efifo_module and DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram. 

Module specification: 

The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_input_efifo_module is a hardware design functioning as a simple two-entry FIFO buffer for managing read and write operations based on buffer status. Inputs include clock signal (clk), reset signal (reset_n), read data command (rd), write data command (wr), and write data (wr_data). Outputs include signals indicating the memory status- almost_empty, almost_full, empty and full, as well as data read from the buffer (rd_data). The internal signals in this module (like entries, entry_0, entry_1, rdwr, rd_data, rd_address, wr_address) essentially manage the status of the FIFO and the read/write operations.  

The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram module functions as the primary controller for an SDRAM memory device on an Altera DE1-SoC FPGA board. It handles read/write requests, manages refresh operations and interfaces with the FIFO buffer. Its inputs include address, byte enable, chip select, data, read/write signals alongside with the clock signal (clk) and reset signal (reset_n). The outputs carry the SDRAM address, bank address, column address strobe, clock enable, chip select, data, data mask, row address strobe, and write enable. Internal signals within this module (like CODE, ack_refresh_request, active_addr, active_bank, active_cs_n, active_data, active_dqm, active_rnw etc.) handle the storage and control operations of the SDRAM. 

The code is structured into sections reflecting different operations, such as initialization, control operation handling, data in/out managing, and read/write operation management. The architecture provides a solid structure for memory management in hardware designs, utilizing Verilog RTL.
