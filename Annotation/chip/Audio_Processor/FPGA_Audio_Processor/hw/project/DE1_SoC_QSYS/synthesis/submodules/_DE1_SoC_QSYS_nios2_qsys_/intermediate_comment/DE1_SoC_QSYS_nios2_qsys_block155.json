    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for defining the next state data for the second loadable byte (`av_ld_byte2_data_nxt`). Depending on certain conditions, it accomplishes its function by utilizing the 'assign' construct for continuous assignment. The value is determined based on whether `av_ld_rshift8` or `av_ld_extend` is asserted. If `av_ld_rshift8` is high, the next state data is obtained from `av_ld_byte3_data`. When `av_ld_extend` is high, the data is extended by replicating `av_fill_bit` 8 times. In all other cases, bits from 16 to 23 of `d_readdata` are used as the next state data."
