    "block_comment": "This block of code is for a synchronous Register Update Logic in a Verilog RTL design. It updates a register named `W_ipending_reg` based on the clock (`clk`) and an active low reset signal (`reset_n`). On the rising edge of the clock (`posedge clk`) or the falling edge of the reset signal (`negedge reset_n`), the block checks if `reset_n` is 0. If this is true, it means the system is in reset state, so it clears the `W_ipending_reg` to 0. Otherwise, it updates `W_ipending_reg` with the value of `W_ipending_reg_nxt`."
