    "block_comment": "This block assigns `D_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br` to `true` if any of the listed conditions from `D_op_call` to `D_op_callr` are true, implementing the logic behind an 'unconditional transfer of control' operation in a processor. The method used for this operation is a logical OR operation between various operations, such as `call`, `jmpi`, `eret`, `bret`, `ret`, and `jmp`, which are some of the many different types of processor commands and operations."
