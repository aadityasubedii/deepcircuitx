This block of code is a part of a synchronous design in Verilog, specifically a register operation that updates a value based on clock events. The block initializes or updates the 'readdata' register. If there's a falling edge in the 'reset_n' signal, the block will reset 'readdata' to zero; on the other hand, if there's a rising edge in the clock signal ('clk') and 'clk_en' is enabled, 'readdata' is updated with the value of 'read_mux_out' sign-extended to 32 bits. This is achieved by using an 'always' block with both 'posedge clk' and 'negedge reset_n' as its sensitive list, meaning the block is evaluated at every positive edge of 'clk' or negative edge of 'reset_n'.
