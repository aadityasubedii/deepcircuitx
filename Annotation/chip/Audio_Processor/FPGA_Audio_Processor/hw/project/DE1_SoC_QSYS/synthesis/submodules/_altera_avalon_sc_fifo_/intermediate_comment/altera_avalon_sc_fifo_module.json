    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable Avalon-ST FIFO with optional packet handling, store-and-forward operation, and CSR interface. It uses parameterized memory (blocks or registers) for data storage, manages read/write pointers, and handles status flags. The module supports features like almost full/empty, error handling, and cut-through operation, implemented through generate statements for hardware customization based on parameters."
