The block of code is performing control signal assignment for a write control instance in data path. The data path's write control instance, `D_ctrl_wrctl_inst`, is directly assigned the value of `D_op_wrctl`. This is a simple Verilog assignment operation, commonly used in RTL coding for data transfers or signal controls between modules or within a module.
