    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog code defines a module named 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_scfifo_r', which appears to be the read side of a Single-Clock FIFO queue, designed to be used with the JTAG UART on the DE1-SoC board. This FIFO queue leverages the board's native QSYS capabilities to send and receive data in a serial format synchronized with a single clock (clk). Specifically, the blocks of this design are including: the clear signal (fifo_clear) as a control signal to empty the FIFO, the read signal (fifo_rd) for reading data from the FIFO, a negative reset signal (rst_n), the input data signal (t_dat) and another writing signal (wr_rfifo). It outputs EF signal indicating the FIFO is empty, the output data (fifo_rdata), an indicator showing if the FIFO is full (rfifo_full) and a used indicator shows the status of FIFO usage (rfifo_used)."
