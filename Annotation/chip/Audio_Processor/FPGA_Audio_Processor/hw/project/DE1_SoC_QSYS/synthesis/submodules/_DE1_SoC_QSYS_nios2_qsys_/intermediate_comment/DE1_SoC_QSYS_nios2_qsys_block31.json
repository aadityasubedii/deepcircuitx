    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code defines the sequential logic for a register `R_ctrl_ld_non_io`, which is sensitive to a rising-edge clock signal `clk` and an active-low synchronous reset `reset_n`. At the negative edge of `reset_n`, the register `R_ctrl_ld_non_io` is forced to default to 0. When `reset_n` is not asserted and at the positive clock edge, if `R_en` is enabled, the next state data `R_ctrl_ld_non_io_nxt` is loaded into `R_ctrl_ld_non_io` else the value of the `R_ctrl_ld_non_io` register will remain the same."
