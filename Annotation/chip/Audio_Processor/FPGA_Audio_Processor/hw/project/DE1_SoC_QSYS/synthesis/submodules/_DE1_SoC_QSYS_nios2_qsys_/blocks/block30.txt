Comment: 
This block of Verilog code assigns and sets the control signal `D_ctrl_st` high (1) whenever any of the defined operations (`D_op_*`) occur. The `assign` keyword is used to define continuous assignments which propagate changes in input values through the combinational logic defined by and implement in the assignment. The bitwise OR operator (`|`) used here specifies that the control signal should be set even if only one of the operation signals are high. Therefore, control command `D_ctrl_st` will be high even if a single store operation (`D_op_st*`) or `D_op_rsv61` is triggered.
