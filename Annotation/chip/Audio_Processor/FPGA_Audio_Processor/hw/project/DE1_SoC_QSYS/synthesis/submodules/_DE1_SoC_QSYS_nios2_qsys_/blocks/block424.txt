This block manages the control signal `E_xbrk_traceon` that monitors the trace-on condition for breakpoints. The process is triggered at the positive edge of the clock (`clk`) or at the negative edge of the asynchronous reset signal (`reset_n`). When `reset_n` is de-asserted (0), `E_xbrk_traceon` is reset to 0 indicating no trace. When `E_cpu_addr_en` is high, `E_xbrk_traceon` takes the value of `xbrk_ton_hit`, effectively enabling the trace-on condition if a breakpoint is hit.
