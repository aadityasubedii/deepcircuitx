    "block_comment": "This block of code control the enabling of a byte of load data in a memory unit. It uses a combination of bitwise operations (NOT(~), AND(&)) on three parameters: 'av_ld_extend', 'D_mem16', and 'av_ld_rshift8' to determine the state of 'av_ld_byte1_data_en'. If 'av_ld_extend' or 'av_ld_rshift8' is high (1'b1) and 'D_mem16' is low (1'b0), the 'av_ld_byte1_data_en' is disabled (1'b0). In all other cases, 'av_ld_byte1_data_en' is enabled (1'b1)."
