    "block_comment": "This block assigns the logical OR of four signals (xbrk0_ton_hit, xbrk1_ton_hit, xbrk2_ton_hit, and xbrk3_ton_hit) to the signal xbrk_ton_hit. It essentially checks whether any of the four input signals are in the 'true' state. If any of the input signal is 'true', then xbrk_ton_hit will be set to 'true'. The pipe (|) operator to perform the bitwise OR operation on the signals."
