Comment: 
This block of code covers the assignment of DRAM addresses and memory byte read operations. The 10 least significant bits of 'a' are assigned to 'addr_col', creating the column address. Column and row addresses are combined to form 'test_addr'. Memory read data is assigned to 'mem_bytes'. If 'dqm' signal is true for its corresponding byte, 'rmw_temp' is filled with 'mem_bytes' otherwise the value from 'zs_dq' is used, providing functionality for read-modify-write operations on the DRAM.
