Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart. \n   Explanation: This module represents a JTAG UART function in the DE1_SoC system. JTAG UART means it's interfacing with the JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) protocol through a UART (universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter) interface. It can handle requests (both reading and writing) from its higher-level module (chip select-based) and perform operations like buffering data or triggering interrupts. The module uses a number of registers and wires to handle different tasks like checking the status of fifo buffer fullness(FIFO_AF), emptiness (FIFO_AE), performing clearing, reading, and writing operations in the fifo buffer.\n\n2. Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_scfifo_w.\n   Explanation: This is a simplified simulation model of a fifo write operation. It takes in inputs such as clock and data to be written into the fifo buffer, and outputs the status of the fifo buffer like how many data it has used, whether it's empty or full. \n\n3. Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_sim_scfifo_r.\n   Explanation: This is a simplified simulation model of a fifo read operation. It performs operations like checking the number of data left in the fifo, if there is a new data signal, etc. It has inputs like clock, a signal indicating a read operation, and outputs that tell the status of buffer like whether it's full or empty.\n\n4. Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_scfifo_r.\n   Explanation: This is a read operation handler for the fifo buffer. It handles read operations like checking the fifo full and network traffic status etc., and actively clears the fifo when there's a reset signal.\n\n5. Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_sim_scfifo_w.\n   Explanation: This is a simulation model for write operations in the FIFO buffer. When it gets the fifo write signal and clock, it writes the incoming data into the fifo buffer, and updates the status of buffer accordingly. \n\nIt's noticed that they are all part of the DE1_SoC_QSYS system, either for simulation purpose or the actual controller for UART JTAG interface. This set of modules essentially manages operations of writing to and reading from fifo buffer, as well as interrupt handling and status updating."
