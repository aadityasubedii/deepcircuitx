    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the assignment for the `d_write_nxt` signal. The assignment is determined by the bitwise AND operation between the `R_ctrl_st` and `E_new_inst` signals, or the bitwise AND operation between the `d_write` and `d_waitrequest` signals. If either sets of conditions are met, the `d_write_nxt` signal is asserted. The combined effect is that `d_write_nxt` will be updated whenever a new instruction is within the control state or when the device is waiting for a write operation."
