Comment: 
This block assigns the value of 'tr_data' based on a conditional operation. If the zero is true (which it is not, as zero is always false), 'tr_data' is assigned the value of 'tr_data_reg'; otherwise, the 'tr_data' is assigned the value zero. This statement effectively forces 'tr_data' to always be zero.
