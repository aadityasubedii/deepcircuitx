This block of Verilog code implements a two-stage pipeline where data is moved from one stage to the next at each clock cycle. When a high active 'reset_n' signal is received, the function initializes 'd1_data_in' and 'd2_data_in' to zero. On a positive clock edge, if 'clk_en' is set, data flow from 'data_in' to 'd1_data_in', and from 'd1_data_in' to 'd2_data_in', effectively implementing the two pipeline stages.
