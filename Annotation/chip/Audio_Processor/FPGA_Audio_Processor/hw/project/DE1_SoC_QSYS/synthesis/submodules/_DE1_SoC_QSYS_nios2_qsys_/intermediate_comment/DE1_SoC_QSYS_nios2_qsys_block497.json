    "block_comment": "This block of code from a Verilog RTL design manages monitor control signals based on various input conditions. Upon every positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the 'jrst_n' signal, it performs checks and updates the states of the 'monitor_ready', 'monitor_error', and 'monitor_go' signals. If 'jrst_n' is 0, it resets these signals. However, if 'jrst_n' is 1, the signals are updated according to the states of 'take_action_ocimem_a', 'ocireg_mrs', 'ocireg_ers', 'jdo' bus signals and 'st_ready_test_idle'. Complex if-else conditions are used to implement this logic."
