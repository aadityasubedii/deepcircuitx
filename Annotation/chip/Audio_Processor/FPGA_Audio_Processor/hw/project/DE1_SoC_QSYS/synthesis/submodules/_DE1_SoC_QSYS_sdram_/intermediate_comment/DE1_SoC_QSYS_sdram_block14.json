    "block_comment": "This block of code controls a refresh counter in a synchronous system. Upon receiving a negative reset signal (`reset_n == 0`), the refresh counter is set to 14300. If the counter decreases to zero under normal operation, it is reset to 1117. Otherwise, the counter is decremented by one at each positive clock edge."
