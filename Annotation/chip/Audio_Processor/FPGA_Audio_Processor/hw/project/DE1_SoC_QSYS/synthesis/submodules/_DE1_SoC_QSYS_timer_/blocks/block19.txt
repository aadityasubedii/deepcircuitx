Comment: 
This block of code manages a counter control variable 'counter_is_running' in a synchronous digital system. Sensitive to positive edge of the clock 'clk' or negative edge of reset 'reset_n', the block resets the control variable to 0 whenever 'reset_n' is 0 signifying active low asynchronous reset. If 'reset_n' is high or inactive, the block checks whether 'clk_en' is enabled and then either starts or stops the counter based on 'do_start_counter' and 'do_stop_counter' flags, setting 'counter_is_running' to -1 or 0 correspondingly.
