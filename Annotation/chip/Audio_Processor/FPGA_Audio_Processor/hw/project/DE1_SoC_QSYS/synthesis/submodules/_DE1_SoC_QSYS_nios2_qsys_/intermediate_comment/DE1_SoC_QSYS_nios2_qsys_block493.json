    "block_comment": "This block of code performs an arithmetic function, specifically an increment operation on a subset of MonAReg. The operation takes place within a 9-bit window of the MonAReg register, specifically bits 2 through 10. The value of this subset is incremented by one (1) and the result is assigned to MonARegAddrInc in the hardware design."
