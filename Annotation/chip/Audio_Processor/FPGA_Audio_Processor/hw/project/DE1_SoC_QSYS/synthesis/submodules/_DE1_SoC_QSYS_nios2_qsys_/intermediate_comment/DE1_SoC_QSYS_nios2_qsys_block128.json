    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a wire assignment for a register \"W_status_reg\". The assignment operation is achieved by setting the value of register \"W_status_reg_pie\" to the value of \"W_status_reg\". This is a common operation in hardware programming that is used to update the state of a particular system element, in this case, the \"W_status_reg\" register."
