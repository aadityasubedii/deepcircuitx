Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_key. 

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key module is designed to manage the interrupt scheme and read-write operations for key inputs on a DE1-SoC platform, operating specifically with the QSYS system. It beholds seven input ports, which include: 

1. 'address' to decide which internal state to read; 'chipselect' 
2. 'clk' marking the clock input
3. 'in_port' presenting the state of the keys
4. 'reset_n' a reset signal
5. 'write_n' the write command signal 
6. 'writedata' a data port used for writing. 

There are two output ports: 'irq' (interrupt request signal) and 'readdata' which provides the read data output. 

Internally, the module utilizes various signals including 'clk_en' for enabling actions synchronized with clock, 'd1_data_in' and 'd2_data_in' for edge detection, 'data_in' reflecting the state of the keys, 'edge_capture' for capturing rising edge events of keys, 'irq_mask' for interrupt masking, and several others for performing operations. 

The code consists of different blocks, such as assigning values to signals, conditional blocks for read and write operations, interrupt triggering, and edge detection for key press actions. These blocks are structured to perform specific tasks within the module, driven by the states of input and internal signals. The module effectively harnesses these elements to read the state of keys, generate interrupts on detecting key press, and manage read-write operations with flexibility to mask interrupts.
