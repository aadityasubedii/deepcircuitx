This block manages the state and contents of a memory module. It maintains flags to indicate whether the module is full or empty and updates these depending on the module's usage. When the depth is 1, it sets 'full' only if there's data and no read operation is ongoing. The block also retrieves the payload from the first memory slot. If the 'EMPTY_LATENCY' equates to 0, it identifies the module as empty if there's no data and no valid input, while simultaneous absence of data and valid input assigns the input payload to 'internal_out_payload'.
