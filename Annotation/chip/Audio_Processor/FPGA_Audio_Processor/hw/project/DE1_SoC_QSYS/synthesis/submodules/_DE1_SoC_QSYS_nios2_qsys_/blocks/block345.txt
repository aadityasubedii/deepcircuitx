Comment: 
This block assigns the value of the `trc_on` signal. The signal is set as a boolean logic operation result, specifically an AND operation (`&`) between the second bit of the `trc_ctrl` signal and the inclusive OR operation (`|`) between the tenth bit of `trc_ctrl` and `not_in_debug_mode` signal. This combination implies that `trc_on` gets activated when the specific conditions on `trc_ctrl` and `not_in_debug_mode` are met.
