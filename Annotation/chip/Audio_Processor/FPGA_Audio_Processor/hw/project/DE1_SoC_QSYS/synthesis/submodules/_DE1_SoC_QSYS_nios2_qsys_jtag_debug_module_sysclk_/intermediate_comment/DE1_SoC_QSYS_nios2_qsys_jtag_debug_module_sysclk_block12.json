    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a boolean value to `take_action_ocimem_b` signal. The signal is asserted when three conditions are valid: first, the `enable_action_strobe` signal must be high; second, the instruction register `ir` must contain the binary value `00` and third, the 36th bit in the `jdo` register must be high."
