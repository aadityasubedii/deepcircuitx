    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog handles the forwarding of a control signal to the next pipeline stage. The operation it fulfills is purely combinational, assigning the value of `D_ctrl_hi_imm16` to `R_ctrl_hi_imm16_nxt` in every clock cycle. This approach is a typical design decision in pipelined architectures, ensuring that control signals are appropriately advanced in each stage of the pipeline for subsequent computations."
