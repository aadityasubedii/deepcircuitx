    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates a Generate statement in Verilog. Generate statement is often used for creating configurable, parametric or replicable hardware structures in design. However, this block doesn't contain anything to generate yet. Apparently, it seems that it is designed to create conditionally generated structures based on the \"inBitsPerSymbol\" variable equaling a certain value. But it's incomplete as the condition check for \"inBitsPerSymbol\" against 34 is not followed by the Generate block code."
