Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck. 

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck is a JTAG debug module for a NIOS II system that shifts and stores data based on the JTAG instructions received and the state of certain controls. Functionality is segmented mainly within a single major "always" block, parameterized by the rising edge of the JTAG clock. This block is responsible for determining the size of the data register based on instruction received, loading different data into the shift register based on instruction and the control signal states, and shifting the register based on size determined and the input test data.

Input ports include the MonDReg and break_readreg for storing monitor data and breakpoint read data respectively, signals indicating which data breakpoint has been hit (dbrk_hit0_latch to dbrk_hit3_latch), debugack for acknowledging the debug process, ir_in for storing JTAG instruction register, jtag_state_rti indicating the state of the JTAG state machine, monitor_error and monitor_ready signals, reset_n and resetlatch for module reset functionality, tck as clock input, and tdi as test data input. Additional inputs include control signals for trace memory operations, trigger breakpoint type and its state, and JTAG state machine controls.

Output ports comprise of ir_out representing the value of instruction register, jrst_n corresponding to the active low reset signal, sr as primary output storing/shifting data based on operations within the module, st_ready_test_idle to indicate JTAG TAP Controller's state, and tdo for testing data output.

Internally, the module uses signals including DRsize for determining data register size, debugack_sync and monitor_ready_sync for synchronized value of debug acknowledgment and monitor ready signals respectively, sr as data storage, tdo to connect the first bit of sr to the tdo output port, and unxcomplemented_resetxx1 and unxcomplemented_resetxx2, both being timing safety signals for module reset. Synchronization of the debugack and monitor_ready signals is provided by instantiated Altera standard synchronizer modules.
