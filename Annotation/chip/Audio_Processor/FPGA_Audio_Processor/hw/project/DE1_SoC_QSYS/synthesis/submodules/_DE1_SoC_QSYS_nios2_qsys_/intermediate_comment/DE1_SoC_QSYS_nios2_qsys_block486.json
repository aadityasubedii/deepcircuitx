    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the reset request for an on-chip random access memory (OCIRAM). The reset is triggered when a reset request (`reset_req`) is active (high), and there is no access from the JTAG interface (`jtag_ram_access`) happening. The use of the bitwise AND (`&`) along with the bitwise negation (`~`) on `jtag_ram_access` ensures that the OCIRAM is only reset when there's no JTAG RAM access."
