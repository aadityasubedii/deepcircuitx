Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll. 

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll is a Verilog module that defines the behavior of an Altera Phase Lock Loop (PLL) system intended to generate two output clock signals (outclk_0, outclk_1) with specific frequencies (143.000000 MHz) based on a reference input clock signal (refclk) and reset signals (rst). As part of its operation, it includes an instantiation of the altera_pll component with particular parameters related to clock functionality and frequency. The module has a 'rst' input signal used to reset the PLL and 'refclk' which serves as the reference clock input for the PLL. 

`outclk_0` and `outclk_1` are generated by the PLL from the reference clock and are output signals. 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1' output clock signals which operate at 143MHz frequency; the 'locked' output signal represents the lock status of the PLL, indicating when the PLL's output frequency and phase are stable and match the expected values. 

There aren't any explicitly declared internal signals in the code; however, internally, the 'fboutclk' and 'fbclk' are connected within the altera_pll component. 'fboutclk' is typically a feedback output clock to maintain the lock of the PLL with the original input, while 'fbclk' represents the feedback input clock - which is statically defined in the module as '1'b0'. 

The code comprises mainly of the definition of the module inputs and outputs, the instantiation of the altera_pll component, and the connection of these signals to the altera_pll instance. The main functionality is encapsulated within the altera_pll block; this is where the output frequencies and phases, operation mode, and other parameters are determined based on the set configurations.
