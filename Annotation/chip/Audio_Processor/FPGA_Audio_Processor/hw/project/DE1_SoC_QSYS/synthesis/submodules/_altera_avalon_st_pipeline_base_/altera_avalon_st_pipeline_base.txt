Module-level comment: 
The 'altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base' is a two-fold, data-centric pipeline for Altera Avalon ST interface. It accepts data inputs and delivers outputs governed by the ready-valid handshake protocol with two modes: registered and unregistered, controlled by PIPELINE_READY. In 'registered' mode, data travels through two pipeline stages controlled by 'full0' and 'full1'. In 'unregistered' mode, this data bypasses the pipeline stages. 'reset' purges pipeline registers. Please, verify data widths for 'in_data' and 'out_data' match DATA_WIDTH.
