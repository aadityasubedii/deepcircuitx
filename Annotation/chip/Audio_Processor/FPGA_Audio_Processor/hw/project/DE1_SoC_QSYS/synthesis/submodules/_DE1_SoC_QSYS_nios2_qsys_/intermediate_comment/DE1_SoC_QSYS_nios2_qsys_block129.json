    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning a portion of the ALU result to the memory block address (W_mem_baddr). Specifically, the 27 least significant bits (from bit 0 through to bit 26) of the ALU result are selected as the memory block address. This is done using bitwise slicing in Verilog, which extracts a specific range of bits from a given signal or data."
