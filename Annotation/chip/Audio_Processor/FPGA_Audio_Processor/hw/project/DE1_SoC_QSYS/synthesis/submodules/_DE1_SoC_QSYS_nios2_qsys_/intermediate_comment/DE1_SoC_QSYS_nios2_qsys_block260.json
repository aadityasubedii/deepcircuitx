    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is responsible for controlling the value of the signal `x1` based on the clock `clk` and `jrst_n` signal. In cases where the `jrst_n` signal is low, the `x1` is reset to zero in the next clock cycle, effectively creating an asynchronous reset. Otherwise, during a positive clock edge, the `x1` value is flipped (toggled) in the next clock cycle. This can result in an oscillating behavior, creating a T flip-flop."
