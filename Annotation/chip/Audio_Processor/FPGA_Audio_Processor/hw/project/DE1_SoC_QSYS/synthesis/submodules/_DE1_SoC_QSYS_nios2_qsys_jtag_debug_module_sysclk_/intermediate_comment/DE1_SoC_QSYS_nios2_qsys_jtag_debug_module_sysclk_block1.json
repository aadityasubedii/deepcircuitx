    "block_comment": "This block of code is a part of a synchronous digital system design in Verilog. The function of this block is to update the 'ir' and 'jdo' registers based on certain conditions, synchronously on the positive edge of the clock. Specifically, when signal 'jxuir' is high, the 'ir' register is updated with the value from 'ir_in'. Similarly, when the 'update_jdo_strobe' signal is high, the 'jdo' register is updated with the value from 'sr'. Proper synchronization is maintained with the system clock to ensure data integrity across the design."
