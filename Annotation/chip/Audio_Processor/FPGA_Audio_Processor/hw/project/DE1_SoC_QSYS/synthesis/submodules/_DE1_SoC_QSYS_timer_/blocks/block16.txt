Comment: 
This block of code is a synchronous reset logic used to manage a timeout event in a digital circuit. When a negative edge on the reset signal (`reset_n`) occurs, `timeout_occurred` is reset to zero, ensuring that any current timeouts are cleared in case of system reset. If the `reset_n` is not activated and `clk_en` (assumed clock enable) is high, `timeout_occurred` is further managed by two conditions: A timeout reset when `status_wr_strobe` is high and setting `timeout_occurred` to -1 (presumably indicating that a timeout has occurred) when `timeout_event` is high. The `timeout_occurred` acts as a flag to signal that timeout has occurred in the process, and it is both cleared and set under the conditions mentioned. The operation is synchronous with positive edge clocking, providing deterministic and reliable operation.
