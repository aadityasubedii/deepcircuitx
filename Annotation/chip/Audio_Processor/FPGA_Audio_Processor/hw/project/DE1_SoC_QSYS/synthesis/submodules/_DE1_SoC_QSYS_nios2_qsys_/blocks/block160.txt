This block assigns a value to the 'av_ld_done' signal based on a couple of conditions. The 'av_ld_done' signal becomes high when the 'av_ld_waiting_for_data_nxt' signal is low and either 'D_mem32' is high or 'av_ld_aligning_data_nxt' is low. In essence, this block signifies that a load operation has finished when there is no longer data to wait for and the memory has data or alignment is not needed.
