Module Name: DE1_SoC_QSYS. 

Module Specification: The 'DE1_SoC_QSYS' module likely plays a role in interfacing a system with various devices or peripherals on an Altera DE1 System on Chip (SoC) board, used in FPGA designs. The functional implementation of the module is not provided hence the exact specifics are unknown, but the primary interface includes a set of clearly defined input, output, and bidirectional ports with context suggesting it provides controls and connections essential for relevant operations. 

The input ports include the primary system clock 'clk_clk', the 16-bit input data 'data_in_export', four ports 'key_external_connection_export' for key connections, the active-low reset signal 'reset_reset_n', 'sync_in_export' for synchronization, and 'play_btn_in_export' and 'record_btn_in_export' likely connected to play and record functions respectively. 

The output ports include a clock 'clk_sdram_clk' for SDRAM, a 16-bit output data port 'data_out_export', a status signal 'pll_locked_export' indicating the stability of the PLL, SDRAM control signals (address 'sdram_wire_addr', bank address 'sdram_wire_ba', Column Address Strobe (CAS) 'sdram_wire_cas_n', Row Address Strobe (RAS) 'sdram_wire_ras_n', Write Enable (WE) 'sdram_wire_we_n', Clock Enable (CKE) 'sdram_wire_cke', Chip Select (CS) 'sdram_wire_cs_n'), and two Data Output Mask signals 'sdram_wire_dqm'. 

Bidirectional ports include the 16-bit data transfer port for SDRAM 'sdram_wire_dq'. 

The module does not define any internal signals in the given code. Further details on potential internal signals and the internal implementation of the module would require additional code information. 

It should be noted that the code does not detail any specific blocks or sections of the module due to the lack of provided implementation, hence a breakdown of code structure is not feasible with the given details.
