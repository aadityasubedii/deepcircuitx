    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\n// This is the 'DE1_SoC_QSYS' module acting as an interface for an Altera DE1 SoC board. It manages various input and output connections, including those for SDRAM controls, key connections, and system synchronization. It handles external triggers such as play and record commands. The module doesn't define any internal signals. The exact functionality and internal implementation are obscure without the full code but seems to provide controls and connections to various peripherals."
