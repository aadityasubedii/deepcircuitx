Module name: altera_mult_add_ujt2. 

Module specification: The altera_mult_add_ujt2 module is an Altera parameterizable multiplication and adder/subtractor design block typically used in digital signal processing and high-end computation tasks, specifically in executing the multiplier-accumulator concept. Input ports include aclr0 (asynchronous clear input), clock0 (clock signal), dataa, and datab (16-bit wide parallel data inputs for multiplication). The module includes a single 32-bit wide output port, result, which holds the outcome of computations. The module comprises one main internal signal named wire_altera_mult_add_rtl1_result, a 32-bit wide internal wire that temporarily holds the result output from logic processes before assigning it to the main output port. Inside the module, the altera_mult_add_rtl logic block performs multiplication and optional addition or subtraction operations, whose attributes are readily configurable, enabling functions like chain mode behaviour, rounding, saturation, and more. The output from this block then assigns to the main result wire of the altera_mult_add_ujt2 module.
