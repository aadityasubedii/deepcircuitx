    "module": "Module-level comment: The module \"altera_mult_add_ujt2\" performs multiplication and optional addition/subtraction operations after accepting 16-bit wide \"dataa\" and \"datab\" inputs synchronously with \"clock0\" and asynchronous reset \"aclr0\". The operations are performed by an instantiated \"altera_mult_add_rtl\" logic block. An internal 32-bit wide wire - \"wire_altera_mult_add_rtl1_result\" connects the logic block to the main 32-bit wide \"result\" output. The module is suitable for applications requiring the multiplier-accumulator concept.\n"
