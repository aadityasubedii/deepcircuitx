    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the assignment of the ALU result based on various controls. It uses conditional ternary operator to decide the value of 'E_alu_result'. If either 'R_ctrl_br_cmp' or 'R_ctrl_rdctl_inst' is true, it assigns 0 to 'E_alu_result'. If 'R_ctrl_shift_rot' is true, it assigns 'E_shift_rot_result' to 'E_alu_result'. If 'R_ctrl_logic' is true, it assigns 'E_logic_result' to 'E_alu_result'. If 'R_ctrl_custom' is true, it assigns 'E_ci_result' to 'E_alu_result'. Otherwise, it assigns 'E_arith_result' to 'E_alu_result'. The block primarily dictates the result of the ALU operation based on the state of various control signals.\n"
