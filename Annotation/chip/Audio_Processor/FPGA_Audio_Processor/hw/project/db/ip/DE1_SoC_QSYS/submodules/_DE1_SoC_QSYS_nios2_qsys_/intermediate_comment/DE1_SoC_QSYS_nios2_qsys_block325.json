    "block_comment": "This line in Verilog is responsible for incrementing the write pointer for a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory structure. It increases the 'fifo_wrptr' value by one and assigns the result to 'fifo_wrptr_plus1'. This operation prepares the FIFO for the next write operation by advancing the write pointer to the next available space, ensuring orderly and efficient data storage."
