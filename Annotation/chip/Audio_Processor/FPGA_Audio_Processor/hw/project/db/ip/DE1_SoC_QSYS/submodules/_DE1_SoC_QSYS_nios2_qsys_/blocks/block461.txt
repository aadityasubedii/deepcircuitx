Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used for state management of a trigger system. The trigger system is operated on the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of the reset_n signal. If the reset_n signal is low (0), the trigger state is cleared. The trigger state also resets when either xbrk_goto0 or dbrk_goto0 is active in the first state (trigger_state_1). Conversely, if either xbrk_goto1 or dbrk_goto1 is active in the second state (trigger_state_0), the trigger state is set to -1.
