Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code manages a two-flag system (`full0` and `full1`) to control data flow according to the `in_valid` and `out_ready` signals with the means of a synchronous reset. When reset, both flags are cleared to allow incoming data. The code operates cyclically according to both flags' states, setting `full1` if data is valid and both flags are not set, setting `full0` when `full1` is set but `full0` is not and the input is valid with no readiness for output, while resetting `full1` when the output is ready but no valid input. Lastly, it clears `full0` when both flags are set and the output is ready, preparing for the next set of input data.
