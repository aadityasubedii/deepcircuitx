This block is responsible for handling the control write signals of the design. It specifically monitors for a positive edge of the clock signal or a negative edge of the reset signal. When the reset signal is active (low), it immediately resets the control write to its default state, whereas on every clock cycle, it checks if the 'R_en' signal is active and if so, updates the control write to the next state as per 'R_ctrl_wrctl_inst_nxt'. This ensures a robust handling of control signals, allowing for controlled operations even during reset conditions.
