    "block_comment": "This block performs a zero-check operation on an internal counter. It uses an assign statement to complete a boolean check on `internal_counter`, assigning the outcome to the signal `counter_is_zero`. If internal_counter is equal to zero, `counter_is_zero` is true, otherwise, it is false."
