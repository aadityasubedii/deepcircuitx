This block assigns data from individual bytes to a collective module, accomplishing data alignment. Specifically, it creates an aggregate data word, `av_ld_data_aligned_unfiltered`, by concatenating the contents of four byte-sized variables (`av_ld_byte3_data`, `av_ld_byte2_data`, `av_ld_byte1_data`, `av_ld_byte0_data`). The operation is performed with the `{}` operator, aligning contents in descending order based on the given byte index.
