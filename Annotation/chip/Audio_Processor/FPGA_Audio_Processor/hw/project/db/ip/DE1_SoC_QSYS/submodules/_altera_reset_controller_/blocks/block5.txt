This Verilog RTL block is responsible for synchronizing a reset signal to a clock domain, essential in preventing metastability in digital circuits. Upon a positive edge detection of the clock ('clk'), the block utilizes a shift register implementation, shifting the values of 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain' down by one bit and introducing the 'reset_out_pre' to the MSB of the shift register. This allows for a multi-cycle synchronization of the reset signal to avoid propagation delays.
