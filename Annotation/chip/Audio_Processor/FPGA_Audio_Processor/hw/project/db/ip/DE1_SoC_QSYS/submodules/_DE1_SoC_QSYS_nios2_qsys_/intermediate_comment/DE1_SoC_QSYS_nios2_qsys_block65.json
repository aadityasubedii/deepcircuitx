    "block_comment": "The block handles the control logic register update procedure. There are two potential cases, in line with the conditions of the if-else statements, invoking during two distinct changes of the system state. The control logic resets to 0 on a falling edge reset signal. During a rising edge clock signal and when the enable signal is active, the register value transitions to the next control logic state, keeping the system up-to-date."
