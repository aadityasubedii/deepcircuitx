Comment: 
This block of Verilog code performs a comparison operation to generate a read strobe signal (`rd_strobe`). The block checks if the three least significant bits (2:0) of the `m_cmd` bus equals to the 3-bit binary equivalent of decimal 5 (3'h5). If the condition is met, the `rd_strobe` signal is asserted, indicating a read operation is to be performed.
