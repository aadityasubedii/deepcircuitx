Comment: 
This block of code defines a synchronisation process, triggered at the positive edge of the 'clk' signal or when a 'reset' occurs. When a 'reset' is detected, it initializes 'curr_packet_len_less_one' to 0. If not in 'reset', the block checks for the 'write' signal. When 'write' is high, 'curr_packet_len_less_one' is incremented by 1. Additionally, if 'in_endofpacket' is detected during 'write', it will reset 'curr_packet_len_less_one' to 0, marking the end of the packet data flow.
