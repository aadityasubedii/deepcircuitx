    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block performs a straightforward bit selection operation. Specifically, it takes the three least significant bits (indexes 2 to 0 inclusive) from the input signal `m_cmd` and assigns them to the wire `cmd_code`. It serves as a way of extraction, effectively preparing `cmd_code` for use in subsequent parts of the overall logic design. It gets its input from the string of bits `m_cmd`, applies a simple bit-wise selection operation to yield the output string, and assigns it to `cmd_code`."
