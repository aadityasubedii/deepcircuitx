Comment: 
The block provides synchronous reset and data update capabilities for `ir_out`. It operates in response to the rising edge of the `tck` clock signal or the falling edge of `jrst_n`. If `jrst_n` is 0 (indicating a reset condition), `ir_out` is cleared to 0. Else, `ir_out` is updated to hold the concatenated bit values from `debugack_sync` and `monitor_ready_sync`.
