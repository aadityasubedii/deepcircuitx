Module Name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_input_efifo_module. 

Module Specification: This module functions as an elastic FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer that is used for managing data read/write operations. Its input ports are 'clk' (system clock), 'rd' (read data), 'reset_n' (reset signal), 'wr' (write data), and 'wr_data' (write data being entered into FIFO), whereas output ports are 'almost_empty', 'almost_full', 'empty', 'full', and 'rd_data' (read data from FIFO). This module utilises internal signals such as 'entries' (to track current entries in FIFO), 'entry_0' and 'entry_1' (as storage registers for FIFO data), 'rd_address' and 'wr_address' (as pointers for read/write from/into the FIFO), and 'rd_data' (to output read data). The module includes different blocks for managing read/write operations, as well as handling reset and logic for 'almost_empty', 'almost_full', 'full' and 'empty' indications.

Module Name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram.

Module Specification: This module is designed to manage and control dynamic RAM memory (SDRAM) operations such as read/write/refresh operations, manage timing, row and bank activations, and interactions with the input elastic FIFO. The input ports are 'az_addr' (address input), 'az_be_n' (byte enable), 'az_cs' (chip selection), 'az_data' (data to write), 'az_rd_n' and 'az_wr_n' (read and write control signals), 'clk' (system clock), and 'reset_n' (reset signal). The output ports include 'za_data' (reads data), 'za_valid' (validity of read data), 'za_waitrequest' (flow control), 'zs_addr' (Row address), 'zs_ba' (Bank address), and many more for controlling memory operations. It has a wide array of internal signals like 'cs_n', 'zs_ras_n', 'zs_cas_n', 'zs_we_n' to control different operations in SDRAM, and others like 'i_state', 'i_next', 'i_refs' for handling initialization. It includes many blocks in the Verilog code, for managing dataflow, initialization, refreshing the memory, and managing memory commands.
