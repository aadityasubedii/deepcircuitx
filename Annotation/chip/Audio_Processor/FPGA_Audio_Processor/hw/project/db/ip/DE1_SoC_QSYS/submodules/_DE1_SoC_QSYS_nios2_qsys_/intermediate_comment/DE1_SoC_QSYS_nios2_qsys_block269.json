    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is used for applying a bitwise AND operation over all bits of 'input_tm_cnt' variable. The function of this block is to check if all bits of the 'input_tm_cnt' are high (bitwise AND operation), and the result is stored in the 'input_ge3' variable. This allows this block to be used for detection when a certain condition (all bits high) on the 'input_tm_cnt' is met."
