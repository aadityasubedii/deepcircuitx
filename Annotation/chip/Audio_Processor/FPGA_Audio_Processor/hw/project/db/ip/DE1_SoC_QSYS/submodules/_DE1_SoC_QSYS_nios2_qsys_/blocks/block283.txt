Comment: 
The block enables a specific index (12th) of a FIFO register. The activation is governed by either of three conditions: 1) FIFO's write pointer is at index 12 and input ge1 is asserted, 2) ge2 is free and the write pointer (incremented by 1) at index 12 with input ge2 being asserted, or 3) ge3 is free and the write pointer (incremented by 2) at index 12 with input ge3 being asserted.
