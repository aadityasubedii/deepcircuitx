    "block_comment": "The block is used for arming a logic signal, `xbrk2_armed`, based on specific conditions. The signal `xbrk2_armed` is assigned a logic true when either of the following conditions is met: the fifth bit of `xbrk_ctrl2` and `trigger_state_0` are both true, or the sixth bit of `xbrk_ctrl2` and `trigger_state_1` are both true. In other words, this block implements a 2-input OR gate, with each input resulting from an AND operation."
