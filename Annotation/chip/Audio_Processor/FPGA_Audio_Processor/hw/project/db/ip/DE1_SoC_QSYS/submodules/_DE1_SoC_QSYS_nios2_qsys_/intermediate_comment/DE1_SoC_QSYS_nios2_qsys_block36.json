    "block_comment": "This block of code is assigning the next state of the `R_ctrl_ld_non_io` signal to be the current state of the `D_ctrl_ld_non_io` signal. It does this through the use of the 'assign' keyword, which creates a continuous assignment statement in Verilog. The continuous assignment means that the value of `R_ctrl_ld_non_io_nxt` automatically changes whenever the value of `D_ctrl_ld_non_io` changes, making the former track the latter. This use of continuous assignment is common in hardware design to denote direct correspondence between signals or to model combinational logic."
