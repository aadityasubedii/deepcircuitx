Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS. Module specification: This module is a top-level QSYS system for a DE1-SoC FPGA board, integrating various components including a Nios II processor, memory interfaces (SDRAM and on-chip memory), PLL for clock generation, timers, buttons, and data I/O ports. It has input ports for clock (clk_clk), reset (reset_reset_n), data input (data_in_export), keys (key_external_connection_export), play and record buttons (play_btn_in_export, record_btn_in_export), and synchronization (sync_in_export). Output ports include SDRAM clock (clk_sdram_clk), data output (data_out_export), PLL lock status (pll_locked_export), and various SDRAM control
