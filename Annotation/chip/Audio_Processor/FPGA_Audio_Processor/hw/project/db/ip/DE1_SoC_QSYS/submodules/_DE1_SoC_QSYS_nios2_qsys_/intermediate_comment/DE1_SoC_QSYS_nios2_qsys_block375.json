    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns a constant low logic signal, 1'b0, to the signal named 'dbrk3_traceoff'. The design uses blocking assignment, which means the right side of the equation is evaluated immediately and the result is assigned to the left side. The function of the signal is not clear from this one line of code, and its usage must be inferred from other areas of the code."
