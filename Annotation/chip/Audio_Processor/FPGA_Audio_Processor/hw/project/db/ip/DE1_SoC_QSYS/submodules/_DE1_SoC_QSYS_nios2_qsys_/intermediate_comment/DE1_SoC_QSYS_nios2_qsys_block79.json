    "block_comment": "This block assigns a binary 'OR' operation result of 'D_op_srai' and 'D_op_sra' to 'D_ctrl_shift_right_arith'. The operator '|' performs a bitwise 'OR' operation between the two operands. Consequently, the 'D_ctrl_shift_right_arith' signal would be high if either 'D_op_srai' or 'D_op_sra' is high. Hence, this block is used to control arithmetic right shift operation in the digital system.\n"
