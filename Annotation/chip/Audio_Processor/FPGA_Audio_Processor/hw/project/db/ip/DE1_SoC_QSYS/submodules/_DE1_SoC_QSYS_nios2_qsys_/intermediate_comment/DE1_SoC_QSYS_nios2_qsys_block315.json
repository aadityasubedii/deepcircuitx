    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronous logic block for controlling a first-in-first-out (FIFO) memory component, `fifo_1`. It responds whenever there's a positive edge on the clock (`clk`) or a negative edge on the `reset_n` line. It works as follows: when `reset_n` is 0 (active-low reset is asserted), `fifo_1` is held to 0 - essentially clearing or resetting it. When the reset is not asserted and `fifo_1_enable` is true, the value of `fifo_1` is updated to the value of `fifo_1_mux`. If neither condition is met, the value of `fifo_1` remains unchanged."
