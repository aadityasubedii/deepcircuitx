    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the 'is_external_interrupt' signal a default value of False. This signal is usually used to indicate the occurrence of an external interrupt. The 'assign' keyword is a continuous assignment statement, which assigns a new value to the 'is_external_interrupt' signal whenever any of the right side operand changes. Here, this signal is permanently assigned a logical zero which means no external interrupts are registered."
