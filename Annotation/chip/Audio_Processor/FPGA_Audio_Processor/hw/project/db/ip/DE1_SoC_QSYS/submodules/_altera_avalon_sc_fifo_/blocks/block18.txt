Comment: 
This block of code is designed to compute the fill level of a FIFO buffer in a circuit. It starts off by assigning the current fill level to a local variable `fill_level`. The next part is conditional upon the EMPTY_LATENCY being 3, in which case it increases `fill_level` by a value determined by `out_valid` signal and the ADDR_WIDTH. This block effectively handles latency management and dynamic adjustment of the FIFO buffer's fill level.
