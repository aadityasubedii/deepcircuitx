Comment: 
The block assigns the value of `D_ctrl_implicit_dst_eretaddr` to `R_ctrl_implicit_dst_eretaddr_nxt`. This is achieved using the `assign` keyword to result in a continuous assignment in the Verilog hardware description language. This means `R_ctrl_implicit_dst_eretaddr_nxt` will always take on the value of `D_ctrl_implicit_dst_eretaddr` whenever it changes.
