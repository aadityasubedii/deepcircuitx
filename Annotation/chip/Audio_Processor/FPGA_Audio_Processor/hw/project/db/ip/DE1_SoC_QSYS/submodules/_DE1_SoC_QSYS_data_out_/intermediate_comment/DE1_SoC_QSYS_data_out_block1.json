    "block_comment": "This block of code simply assigns the data output to the outside port. The functionality is achieved through the 'assign' keyword in Verilog, which allows for continuous assignment to the 'out_port'. As a result, whenever the value of 'data_out' changes, 'out_port' will be updated with the latest value."
