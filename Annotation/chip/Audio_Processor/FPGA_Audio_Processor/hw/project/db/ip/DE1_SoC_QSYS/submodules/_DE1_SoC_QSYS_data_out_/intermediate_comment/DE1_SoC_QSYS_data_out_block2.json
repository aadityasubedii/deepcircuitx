    "block_comment": "The block assigns the value of 'read_mux_out' to 'readdata'. It implements this by performing a bit-wise OR operation between a 32-bit zero vector (32'b0 means 32 bits of 0\u2019s) and 'read_mux_out'. This operation effectively keeps 'read_mux_out' as it is and assigns this value to 'readdata', since OR operation with 0 keeps the operand unaltered."
