Comment: 
The block of code determines the next state of the interrupt pending register (`W_ipending_reg_nxt`). The pending status depends on the ANDing of four conditions - iactive (interrupt active), `W_ienable_reg` and `oci_ienable` (two interrupt control signal registers), and an interrupt mask of lower 6 bits. If all these conditions are true, then an interrupt is marked as pending.
