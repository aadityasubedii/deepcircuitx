    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) register 'fifo_10', which is triggered by a clock's positive edge or a reset signal's negative edge. Upon receipt of the negative reset signal, the 'fifo_10' register is reset to zero. If the reset signal is not active and 'fifo_10_enable' is asserted, the value of 'fifo_10_mux' is loaded into 'fifo_10'."
