    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the maximum size of the FIFO. The FIFO's maximum size is calculated by subtracting one from the FIFO_DEPTH, which is likely a predefined constant representing the total depth of the FIFO. This operation is performed using the 'assign' keyword, which in Verilog RTL is typically used to make continuous assignments that are always active and react immediately as soon as one of the right hand side variables changes. Therefore, it inherently handles the dynamic adoption of FIFO sizes in the design."
