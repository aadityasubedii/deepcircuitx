    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code represents a clocked process responsible for controlling a FIFO read operation and maintaining the count of bytes left to be read. Upon each positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the reset signal, the process checks for reset condition. If the reset is active (in this case active low), it initializes the `bytes_left` to zero and `fifo_rd_d` to false, indicating there's no data left and no read operation occurring. However, if the reset is not active, it assigns the value of `fifo_rd` to `fifo_rd_d`. Further, if the `fifo_rd_d` is true, the bytes left is decremented indicating a successful read. In case of a new rom data arrival, `bytes_left` gets updated with `num_bytes` representing the number of new bytes to be read."
