    "block_comment": "The block of code captures signals during specific conditions. On triggering the reset_n signal at negative edge or the clk signal at positive edge, the block checks if reset_n is low\u2014if so, it sets the edge_capture to 0. If reset_n is not low, and the clock enable (clk_en) is true, the block checks if the write strobe for capture (edge_capture_wr_strobe) is active\u2014if so, it again sets edge_capture to 0. If the write strobe is not active, but edge detection (edge_detect) is true, it sets edge_capture to -1."
