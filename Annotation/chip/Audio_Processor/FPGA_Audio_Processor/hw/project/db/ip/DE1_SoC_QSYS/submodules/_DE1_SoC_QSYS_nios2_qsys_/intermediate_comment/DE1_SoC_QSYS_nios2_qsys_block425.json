    "block_comment": "This code block functions as a safety mechanism with reset capabilities for the system. It is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal. When the reset signal is not active (indicating 0), the system will set the 'xbrk_break' signal to 0, which typically signifies a safe or non-error state. However, when the address enabling signal 'E_cpu_addr_en' is true and the rest of the system operates under normal conditions, the output signal 'xbrk_break' will take the value of 'xbrk_break_hit'. This could be used to flag or break when the specific address is hit by the CPU."
