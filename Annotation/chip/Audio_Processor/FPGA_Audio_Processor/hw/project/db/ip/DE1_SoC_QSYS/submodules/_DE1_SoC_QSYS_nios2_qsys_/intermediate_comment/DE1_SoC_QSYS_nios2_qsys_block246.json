    "block_comment": "This block of code creates a synchronous circuit that writes data in response to a rising clock edge or falling edge of the signal 'jrst_n'. The write operation is performed based on the condition if 'jrst_n' equals 0, in which case the 'write' register is reset to 0. If the 'jrst_n' is not 0, the value of the 'write' register is either the current value of 'write' if a waitrequest is in progress, otherwise it is updated to the value of 'write_nxt' upon receiving a clock signal or when 'jrst_n' drops to 0."
