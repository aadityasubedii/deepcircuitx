    "block_comment": "This block of code declares a bit-vector, named retired_pcb, and assigns it a binary value of zero. The block uses the 'assign' statement of the Verilog RTL code which performs continuous assignment and is primarily used for creating wire connections. The '32'b0' defines a 32-bit binary value of zero (all 32 bits are zeros)."
