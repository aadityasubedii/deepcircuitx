Comment: 
This block is used to control the pause interrupt signal (`pause_irq`) in the circuit. When the active low reset signal (`rst_n`) is asserted, `pause_irq` is cleared. During the positive edge of the clock, if `t_pause` is true and `fifo_EF` is false, indicating that the FIFO buffer is not empty, `pause_irq` is set. If the read operation (`read_0`) is triggered, `pause_irq` is also cleared. This logic is implemented using an `always` block, a common method for describing state in Verilog.
