    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code monitors a system's active condition, specifically observing if a reset_n is true, upon the positive edge transition of the system clock (clk). Whenever a positive edge in clk occurs, a check is performed to assess the status of reset_n. If reset_n is not 0 (active low), another condition is checked: whether the exclusive OR operation over all bits of F_valid results in an unknown state ('x'). If this is true, the program writes out an error message indicating that F_valid is in an 'x' state, displays the current simulation time, and then halts the operation."
