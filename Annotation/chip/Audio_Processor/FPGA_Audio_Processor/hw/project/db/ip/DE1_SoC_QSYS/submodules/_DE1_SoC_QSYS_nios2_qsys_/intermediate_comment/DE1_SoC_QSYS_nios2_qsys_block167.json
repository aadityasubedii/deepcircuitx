    "block_comment": "This block of code determines whether one more cycle is required for data alignment in load operations, particularly targeting the `av_ld_align_one_more_cycle` signal. The assignment condition hinges on the value of `av_ld_align_cycle`, and whether the 16-bit data memory (`D_mem16`) is active. If `D_mem16` is TRUE, then `av_ld_align_one_more_cycle` will be TRUE when `av_ld_align_cycle` equals 2. If `D_mem16` is FALSE, it will be TRUE when `av_ld_align_cycle` equals 3. This condition check ensures the correct timing for data alignment."
