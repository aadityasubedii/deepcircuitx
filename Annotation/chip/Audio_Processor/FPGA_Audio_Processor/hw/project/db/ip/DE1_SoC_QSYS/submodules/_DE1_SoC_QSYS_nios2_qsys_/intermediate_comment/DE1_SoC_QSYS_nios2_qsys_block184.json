    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential logic block that regulates the behavior of the 'E_shift_rot_cnt' register. The register either gets reset to zero or updated to the next state defined by 'E_shift_rot_cnt_nxt'. The controlling factors for these states are the positive clock edge and the active low reset condition. When the reset signal is active (low), the register is reset to zero, otherwise, on every positive clock edge, the register is updated to its next state defined by 'E_shift_rot_cnt_nxt'."
