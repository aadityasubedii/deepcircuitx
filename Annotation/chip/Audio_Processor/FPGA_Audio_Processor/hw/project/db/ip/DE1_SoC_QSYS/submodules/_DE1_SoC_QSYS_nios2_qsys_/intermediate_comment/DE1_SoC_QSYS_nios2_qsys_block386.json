    "block_comment": "The block assigns a constant boolean value of 0 to the variable `dbrk2_armed`. The `assign` keyword in Verilog denotes that it is a continuous assignment statement, which means it will always be evaluating its right-hand side and assign the evaluated value to the declared signal or variable on its left-hand side. In this specific block, since a constant value is provided, the value of `dbrk2_armed` remains always 0."
