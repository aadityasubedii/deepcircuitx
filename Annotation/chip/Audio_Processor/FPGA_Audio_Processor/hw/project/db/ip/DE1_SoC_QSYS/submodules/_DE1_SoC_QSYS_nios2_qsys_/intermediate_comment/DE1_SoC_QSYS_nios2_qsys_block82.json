    "block_comment": "This block assigns a logical shift control operation to `D_ctrl_shift_logical`. It checks if any of the operations `D_op_slli`, `D_op_sll`, `D_op_srli`, `D_op_srl` are in a high state. If any are active (binary '1'), then `D_ctrl_shift_logical` is also set to '1', enabling a shift operation."
