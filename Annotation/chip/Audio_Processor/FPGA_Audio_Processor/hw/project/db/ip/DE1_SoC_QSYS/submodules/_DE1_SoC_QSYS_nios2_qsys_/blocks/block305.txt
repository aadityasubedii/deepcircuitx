Comment: 
The block selects and assigns an input to the `fifo_4_mux` variable based on specific conditions. The conditions involve checking the write pointer to the FIFO buffer (`fifo_wrptr`), its next state (`fifo_wrptr_plus1`), and multiple valid signal tags (`itm_valid`, `atm_valid`, `dtm_valid`). If the write pointer equals 4, and one of the tags is valid, the block assigns the related input (`itm`, `overflow_pending_atm`, `overflow_pending_dtm`) to `fifo_4_mux`. If next state of the write pointer equals 4 and all tags are valid, an overflow input is assigned, depending on the condition met. If none of these conditions meet, `overflow_pending_dtm` is assigned as the default value.
