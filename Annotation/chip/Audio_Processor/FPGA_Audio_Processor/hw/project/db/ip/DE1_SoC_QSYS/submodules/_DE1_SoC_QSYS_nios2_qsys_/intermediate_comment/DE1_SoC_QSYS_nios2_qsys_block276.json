    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a FIFO (First In, First Out) memory element management system in Verilog. It functions by resetting or updating the memory element, 'fifo_14', based on clock or reset signal transitions. On the falling edge of 'reset_n', 'fifo_14' is cleared to 0. On the rising edge of 'clk' and when 'fifo_14_enable' is high, 'fifo_14' is updated to 'fifo_14_mux'.\n"
