This block of code handles the reset and update of the instance register `R_ctrl_rdctl_inst` under the control of clock signal `clk` and reset signal `reset_n`. It implements synchronous positive-edge triggered logic that checks the state of reset signal. If `reset_n` is 0, the code block resets the register to 0. If there is a clock pulse (positive edge) and the reset is not activated, and `R_en` is true, the block updates `R_ctrl_rdctl_inst` value with `R_ctrl_rdctl_inst_nxt`.
