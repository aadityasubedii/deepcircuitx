This PLL takes in a reference clock signal (refclk) and a reset signal (rst) and produces two output clock signals (outclk_0 and outclk_1). In addition, the PLL also emits a 'locked' signal indicating the lock status of the PLL. The PLL is configured using an Altera-provided module called altera_pll, and its configuration parameters are set within the instantiation of this module (e.g., reference clock frequency, number of clocks, output clock frequencies, phase shift, duty cycle, etc.). Essentially, it uses the reference clock to generate two output clocks with the specified frequencies and phase shifts, and the PLL adjusts its internal VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) to maintain these output frequencies in alignment with the input reference clock frequency."

When activated, it brings the PLL to its initial state.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, outclk_1, locked. \nExplanation: \n1. outclk_0: This is the first output clock signal generated by the PLL.

Like the first, its frequency is also a derivative of the reference clock set by the defined parameters.\n3. locked: This signal indicates the lock status of the PLL. It goes high when the PLL achieves lock, meaning the output frequency and phase have been aligned with the reference, and maintains high as long as the PLL remains locked."
