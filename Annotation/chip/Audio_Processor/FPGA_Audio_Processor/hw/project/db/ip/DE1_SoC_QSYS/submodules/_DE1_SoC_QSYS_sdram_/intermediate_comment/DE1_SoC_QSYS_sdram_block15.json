    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a module instantiation for a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer for an SDRAM. This FIFO buffer is particularly used for the input operations from the SDRAM on an FPGA including the DE1-SoC system. The FIFO can buffer data in order to manage timing differences between writing and reading data. The buffer flags include 'almost empty', 'almost full', 'empty', and 'full' to prevent data overflow and underflow conditions. Signals are also defined for reading and writing data (`rd` and `wr`). `wr_data` arranges the write signal, address, byte enable, and data into a single bus for data writing."
