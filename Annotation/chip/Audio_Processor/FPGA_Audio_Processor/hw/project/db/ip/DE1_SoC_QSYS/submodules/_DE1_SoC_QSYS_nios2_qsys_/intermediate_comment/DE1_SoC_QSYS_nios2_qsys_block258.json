    "block_comment": "This single line of Verilog code assigns the least significant bit of the \"trc_ctrl\" vector to the \"trc_enb\" signal. In essence, it controls whether a specific tracing feature is enabled or disabled in the design based on a configuration bit in the \"trc_ctrl\" vector. This is a common idiom used to enable or disable functionalities dynamically in a hardware design module, creating flexibility within the system for various operating modes."
