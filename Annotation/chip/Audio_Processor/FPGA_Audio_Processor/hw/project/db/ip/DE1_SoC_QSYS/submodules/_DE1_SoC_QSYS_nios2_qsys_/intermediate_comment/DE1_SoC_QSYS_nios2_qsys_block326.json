    "block_comment": "The block of code presents a function where it checks whether the FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure is empty or not. This is achieved using bitwise reduction NOR (`~|`) operation on the FIFO count (`fifo_cnt`). If the FIFO count is 0, then the entire FIFO is regarded as empty, otherwise it's not."
