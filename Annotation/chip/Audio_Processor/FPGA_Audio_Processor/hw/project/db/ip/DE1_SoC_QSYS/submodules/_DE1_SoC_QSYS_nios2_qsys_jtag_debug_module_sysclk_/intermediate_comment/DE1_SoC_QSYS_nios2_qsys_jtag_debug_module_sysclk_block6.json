    "block_comment": "This block of code determines when to initiate a certain action, identified as 'take_action_break_b'. The action occurs when several conditions are met. The system must be enabled via 'enable_action_strobe', instruction register 'ir' must contain the binary value '10', and the 36th and 37th bits of the jdo data structure must be set to 1. However, the 35th bit of jdo should be 0. Together, these conditions determine whether the system will activate the 'take_action_break_b' action."
