    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a constant value of '0' to the wire 'dbrk0_high_value'. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements, serving to continuously drive the wire named 'dbrk0_high_value' with the constant value '0'. The purpose of this code is to ensure that 'dbrk0_high_value' always retains the value '0' at all times in the system. Hence, the function is straightforward, it involves continuous assignment with no condition applied."
