    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is performing a simple assignment function. The left-hand signal `oci_tb_hbreak_req` is assigned the same logical level as the right-hand signal `oci_hbreak_req`. This ensures that the state or value of `oci_tb_hbreak_req` directly reflects the state of `oci_hbreak_req` at all times during simulation or synthesis process."
