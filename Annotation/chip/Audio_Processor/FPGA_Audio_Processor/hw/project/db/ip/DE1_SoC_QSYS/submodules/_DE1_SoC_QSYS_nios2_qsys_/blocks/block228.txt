Comment: 
This block is responsible for assignment operation within the Verilog code. In this block of code, the signal `F_av_iw` is assigned the value present on `i_readdata`. This is done using the `assign` construct in Verilog which continuously drives the value of `i_readdata` to `F_av_iw`, essentially making `F_av_iw` behave as a wire that mirrors `i_readdata`.
