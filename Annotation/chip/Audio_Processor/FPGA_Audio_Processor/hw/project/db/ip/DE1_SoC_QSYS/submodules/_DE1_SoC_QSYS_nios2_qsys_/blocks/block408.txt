Comment: 
This line assigns the signal `d_read` to `cpu_d_read`. It is a simple assignment statement which means when `d_read` changes its value, `cpu_d_read` will instantly inherit the same value. This is typically used to relay or distribute signals to different parts of the circuitry in a hardware design. The assignment happens continuously whenever there is a change in the value of `d_read`.
