Comment: 
This block of code is a Register File read operation. The operation extracts and assigns 8 bits of the `R_rf_b` registered array, specifically the bits from 7 to 0, to a signal named `R_stb_data`. This signal represents the lower byte of the `R_rf_b` array and this is achieved using the Verilog 'assign' statement for continuous assignment.
