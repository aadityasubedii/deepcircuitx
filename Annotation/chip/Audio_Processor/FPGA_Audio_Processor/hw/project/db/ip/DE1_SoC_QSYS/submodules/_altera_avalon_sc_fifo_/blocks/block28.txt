Comment: 
The `gen_blk14` block is activated if the `EMPTY_LATENCY` value is greater than 1. This is a conditional hardware generation block in Verilog, where the code inside this block is instantiated during synthesis only if the condition around the `generate if` statement is true. Hence, in this case, the hardware described inside `gen_blk14` will only be part of the design when `EMPTY_LATENCY` is more than 1.
