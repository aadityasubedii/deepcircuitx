Comment: 
This block of code is a part of a memory management system in a Verilog RTL design, specifically for determining the full, empty states, and managing output payload. The block uses the 'mem_used' array to indicate which memory slots are in use, with 'full' indicating whether the last slot is in use and 'empty' showing if the first slot is not in use. Special conditions arise when DEPTH equals 1, where 'full' is only true when the first slot is in use and no reading is going on. It sets 'internal_out_payload' with the data from the first slot. An additional case is managed when 'EMPTY_LATENCY' is zero, consequentially, 'empty' condition is modified to also track 'in_valid' and 'internal_out_payload' could be directly assigned the incoming payload if a slot is free and valid data is incoming.
