    "block_comment": "This block assigns tracking control signals in test mode. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used to drive continuous values onto the four wire identifiers: `record_load_addr`, `record_store_addr`, `record_load_data`, and `record_store_data` from the `td_mode_trc_ctrl` signal. Essentially, it sets up the environment to record or track data and address signals for loads and stores during test/debug mode."
