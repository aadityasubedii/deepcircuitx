The block handles the functionality of a synchronous reset logic for the register W_bstatus_reg. It operates on the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal reset_n, that when receives an active reset signal (implied as active low as reset_n is checked for being '0'), it asynchronously resets the register W_bstatus_reg by forcing it to '0'. Alternatively, when the reset signal is not active, the register W_bstatus_reg is updated with the value of W_bstatus_reg_nxt at every positive clock edge.
