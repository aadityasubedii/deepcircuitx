This block performs the function of enabling write control based on a certain condition. Specifically, it assigns the bitwise AND of the instance of write control from the control register (R_ctrl_wrctl_inst) and the condition of the input write control register number (D_iw_control_regnum) being equal to zero, to E_wrctl_status. If both conditions are true (the indication reaching the write control and the register number being zero), the write operation is enabled.
