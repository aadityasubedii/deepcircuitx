    "block_comment": "This block of code creates an assignment of a logical inversion function to the `trigger_state_0` wire. The use of the tilde(`~`) operator shows that this function will flip the bit (or bits in case of bus) of the current state of `trigger_state`, achieving a NOT operation, converting all 1s to 0s and vice versa. The result is then assigned to `trigger_state_0`, providing a method to inversely track the state of `trigger_state` within the system."
