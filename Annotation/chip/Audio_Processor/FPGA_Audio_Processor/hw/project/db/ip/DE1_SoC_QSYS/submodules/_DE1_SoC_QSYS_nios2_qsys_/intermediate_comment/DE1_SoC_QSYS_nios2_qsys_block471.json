    "block_comment": "This line of code simply assigns a constant value of '0' to the wire named 'dbrk2_low_value'. By doing this, the code effectively initializes or resets 'dbrk2_low_value' to zero each time this assignment statement is evaluated, resulting in the named wire always presenting a zero state. Underneath, these implementations are used to set default system states or to clear specific signals in the RTL design."
