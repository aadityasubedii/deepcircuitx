    "block_comment": "The block of code serves as a Synchronous Reset for a control unit in a micro-architectural level representation of an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit). It uses a clock signal for synchronization and an active low reset signal. The primary function of the if-else conditional statement is to set a certain flag, `R_ctrl_alu_force_xor`, to its default state, `0`, whenever a reset condition `reset_n == 0` is met. This block, in normal operation, latches the next state `R_ctrl_alu_force_xor_nxt` of `R_ctrl_alu_force_xor` if the `R_en` (Enable Signal) is high. It uses sequential logic (`always @` block) to change the state of `R_ctrl_alu_force_xor` based on specific clock conditions."
