Comment: 
This block of Verilog code functions as a synchronous data pipeline with optional reset and clock enable signals. When the active-low reset_n signal is asserted, this block will zero out both stages of the pipeline, namely d1_data_in and d2_data_in. However, outside of reset conditions, this block will latch incoming data into the first stage (d1_data_in) and move data from first stage to the second stage (d2_data_in) provided that the clock enable (clk_en) signal is asserted. All operations happen at the rising edge of clk signal.
