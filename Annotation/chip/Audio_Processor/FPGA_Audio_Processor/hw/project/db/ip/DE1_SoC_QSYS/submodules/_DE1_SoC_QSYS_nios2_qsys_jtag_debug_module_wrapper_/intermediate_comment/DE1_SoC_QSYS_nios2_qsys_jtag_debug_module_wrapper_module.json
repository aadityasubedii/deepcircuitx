    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_wrapper, acts as an interface layer for real-time hardware debugging via a JTAG interface. The functionality of the module is facilitated through a variety of input ports that accept debug triggering conditions and output ports that indicate appropriate debug actions. Internally, the module operates through dedicated control signals and instantiates two other modules (DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck and DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_sysclk) to effectively manage the debugging process."
