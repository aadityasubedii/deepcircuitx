Comment: 
The provided block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for assigning the value of `ociram_reset_req`. It does this by taking a bitwise AND operation between `reset_req` and the negation of `jtag_ram_access`. This output will be TRUE only when `reset_req` is active (HIGH/1) and `jtag_ram_access` is inactive (LOW/0), indicating that a reset is requested but not through jtag ram access.
