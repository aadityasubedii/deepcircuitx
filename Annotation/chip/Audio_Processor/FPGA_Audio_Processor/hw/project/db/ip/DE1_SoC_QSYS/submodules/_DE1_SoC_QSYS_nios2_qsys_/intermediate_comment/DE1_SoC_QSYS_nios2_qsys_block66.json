    "block_comment": "The block assigns the next state of the control logic, R_ctrl_logic_nxt, to the current state, D_ctrl_logic. This is achieved through the 'assign' statement in Verilog used for continuous assignment. It declares a net or variable type, where the output is dependent on the state of the inputs. In this case, the input is D_ctrl_logic, and the output is R_ctrl_logic_nxt."
