Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is designed for memory address and data management. At every positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of jrst_n, if jrst_n is zero, it resets the memory address (atm) and memory data (dtm) to 0. Otherwise, the address and data are updated based on the CPU read or write, if both conditions are true. The address and data are prepended by a four bit code signifying the operation performed. If neither condition is true, then the address and data bits are zeroed again, maintaining their respective 4 bit prepended codes.
