Module name: There are two modules in the code, namely `DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_input_efifo_module` and `DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram`. \n\n2. Explanation: \n   - `DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_input_efifo_module`: This module appears to be an elastic FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer that reads and writes data. It uses control signals like read (rd), write (wr), and reset, and data signals like read data (rd_data) and write data (wr_data). The module also generates status signals related to buffer fill levels such as full, empty, almost_full, and almost_empty. \n   - `DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram`: This module seems to manage and control dynamic RAM memory (SDRAM) operations such as read, write, and refresh. It also manages the command queue for these operations, manages timing, manages row and bank activations, and interacts with the input elastic FIFO. The module uses signals for communication, control, and data transmission to and from the SDRAM."
