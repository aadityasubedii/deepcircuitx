    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block represents a synchronous control edge-trigger block. Upon each rising edge of the clock or negative edge of the reset signal, the state of the signal `i_read` is updated. If the `reset_n` is low (0), `i_read` is set to binary 1, effectively resetting the variable. If `reset_n` is high (1), the value of `i_read` is set to the next state `i_read_nxt` value, thereby controlling the state progression based on clock synchronization."
