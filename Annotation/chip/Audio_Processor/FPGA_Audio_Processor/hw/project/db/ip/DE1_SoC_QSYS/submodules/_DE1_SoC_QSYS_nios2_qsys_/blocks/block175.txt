This block manages the conditions for the write function to proceed in the next clock cycle. This is accomplished by using a bitwise AND between the control status (R_ctrl_st) and the new instruction flag (E_new_inst), or a bitwise AND between the existing write flag (d_write) and the wait request flag (d_waitrequest). The result is assigned to the next write flag (d_write_nxt); thus, a write may proceed if the control is set and a new instruction is present or if a write is already in progress but is waiting for a request.
