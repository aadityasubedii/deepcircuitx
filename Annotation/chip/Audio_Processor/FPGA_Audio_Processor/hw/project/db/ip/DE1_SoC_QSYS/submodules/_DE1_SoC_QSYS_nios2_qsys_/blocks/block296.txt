This block of code decides the input data for a multiplexer that feeds into a FIFO with depth 8 (2^3), index ranging from 0 to 7. The multiplexer selects its input data based on the conditions including the write pointer of the FIFO, an overflow flag, two valid bits and the fifo free spaces. Specifically, it checks multiple conditions in series, and the order of these conditions determines the priority of which data will be assigned to the multiplexer input. The data sources into the multiplexer include ITM (Instruction Trace Macrocell), ATM (Advanced Trace Macrocell), and DTM (Data Trace Macrocell) which are all for different overflow situations.
