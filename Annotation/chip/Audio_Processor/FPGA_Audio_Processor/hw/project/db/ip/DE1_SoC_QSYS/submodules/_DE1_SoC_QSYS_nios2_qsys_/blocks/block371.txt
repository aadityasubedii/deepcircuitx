The block of code assigns a constant low signal (0) to the net 'dbrk3_goto1'. This assignment is a combinational logic representation, implying that 'dbrk3_goto1' will instantly assume the value of '0' following any change in the right hand side value, which in this case is a constant so the value will always remain zero.
