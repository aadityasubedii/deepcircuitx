    "block_comment": "This block of code deals with reading memory entries based on an address input (its function). The implementation consists of an 'always' block triggered by changes in 'entry_0', 'entry_1' or 'rd_address'. Inside this, a case statement selects between 'entry_0' and 'entry_1' based on the value of 'rd_address'. If 'rd_address' is 0, 'rd_data' takes the value of 'entry_0'. If 'rd_address' is 1, 'rd_data' takes the value of 'entry_1'. In default case, no action is performed."
