    "block_comment": "The block of code declares an assign statement for the internal_out_ready signal in the design. The signal gets its logic through a combination of the out_ready signal or the negation of the out_valid signal. In simple terms, the internal_out_ready signal will be high (1) if either the out_ready signal is high (1) or the out_valid signal is low (0). Therefore, this logic condition ensures that the internal_out_ready will only be false (0) if the out_ready signal is low (0) and the out_valid is high (1). This could be used to control the flow of data, making sure no outputs are being marked ready while they are still valid."
