Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck is a JTAG debugging module for DE1-SoC's Nios II processor. It uses 16 inputs including control, data, and state signals, and provides 5 outputs including the Instruction Register, JTAG Test Data Out, and Run-Test-Idle status. Internally, it relies on a 3-bit data size register, synchronized debug acknowledgment and monitor ready signals, and a 38-bit shift register. Functionality is facilitated through the use of logical cases dependent on control signals, determining state transitions and manipulating shift register behavior. It also synchronizes two signals using Altera's standard synchronizer blocks.
