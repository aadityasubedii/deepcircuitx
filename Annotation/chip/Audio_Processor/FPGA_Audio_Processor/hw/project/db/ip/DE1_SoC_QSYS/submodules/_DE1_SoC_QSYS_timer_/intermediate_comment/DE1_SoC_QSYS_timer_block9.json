    "block_comment": "This block forms a digital register with synchronous reset logic and asynchronous write capability. At every rising edge of the clock or falling edge of the reset signal, the block modifies the state of 'period_h_register'. In the event of a reset (when 'reset_n' is low), it forces 'period_h_register' to hold the value '2'. Otherwise, during normal operation (when 'period_h_wr_strobe' is high), it writes 'writedata' into 'period_h_register'."
