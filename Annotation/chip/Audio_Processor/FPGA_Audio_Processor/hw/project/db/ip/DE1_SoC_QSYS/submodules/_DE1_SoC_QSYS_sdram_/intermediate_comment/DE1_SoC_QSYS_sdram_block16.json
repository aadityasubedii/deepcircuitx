    "block_comment": "This block of code is utilized to assign specific inputs to corresponding output signals in a memory interface system. First, the system clock is enabled using the \"assign clk_en = 1\" statement. Following that, four memory command signals are assigned from input \"m_cmd\". The statement \"assign zs_addr = m_addr\" assigns the memory address input to the appropriate output. The clock enable output is then set to the previous assigned clk_en. The data bus zs_dq is determined by the oe (output enable) condition, sending the m_data when it is set and in other cases it sends high impedance state. Then, data mask m_dqm and bank address m_bank are assigned to zs\\_dqm and zs\\_ba respectively.\n"
