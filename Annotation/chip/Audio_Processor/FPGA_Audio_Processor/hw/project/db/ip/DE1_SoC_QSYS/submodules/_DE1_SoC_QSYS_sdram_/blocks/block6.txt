Comment: 
This block of code manages a 3-bit shift register for read validation signals, under the control of a clock signal and an active low reset signal. The 3-bit 'rd_valid' shift register is initiated to a value of 0 when 'reset_n' signal is active (0), ensuring the system has a defined state after reset. On the rising edge of each clock cycle when 'reset_n' signal is inactive (1), 'rd_valid' shift register left shifts its values by one bit while the least significant bit (LSB) is replaced by the 'rd_strobe'.
