Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key module acts as an interrupt controller, detecting edge transitions on its input 'in_port' and setting an interrupt ('irq') accordingly. It communicates with an external device using read/write operations signaled by 'chipselect' and 'write_n' through an address and data bus. The module uses internal signals for edge detection ('d1_data_in', 'd2_data_in'), interrupt masking ('irq_mask'), handling read/write data ('read_mux_out', 'readdata'), and reset functionality. Different blocks in the module control synchronization, edge detection, and internal state reset.
