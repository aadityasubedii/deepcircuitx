    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for resetting or updating the value of the W_ipending_reg signal. Primarily, it is a sequential block which is sensitive to a positive edge of the 'clk' or a negative edge of 'reset_n' signal. When the 'reset_n' signal is 0, it means that a reset operation has been initiated, and thus, the 'W_ipending_reg' signal is set to 0. On the other hand, if the 'reset_n' signal is not 0, which indicates no reset is requested, the 'W_ipending_reg' signal is updated with the value of 'W_ipending_reg_nxt' on the positive clock edge.\n"
