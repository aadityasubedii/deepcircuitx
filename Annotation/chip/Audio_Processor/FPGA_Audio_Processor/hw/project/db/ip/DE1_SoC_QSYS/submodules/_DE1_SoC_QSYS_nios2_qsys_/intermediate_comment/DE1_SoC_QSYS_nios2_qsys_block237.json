    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code defines a assign statement for the signal `i_read_nxt`. The function of this RTL block is to manage the conditions under which `i_read_nxt`, or the next read signal, is activated. It's based on two distinct circumstances. The first is when there is a valid write (`W_valid`). The second situation is when there is a simultaneous condition of both current read (`i_read`) and a wait request (`i_waitrequest`). Thus, it manages read timing in situations with potential write or wait conditions."
