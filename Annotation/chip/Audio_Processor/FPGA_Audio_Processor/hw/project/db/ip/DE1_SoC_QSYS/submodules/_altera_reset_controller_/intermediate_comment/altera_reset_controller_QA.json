The parameter list suggests significant configurability, including the number of reset inputs and various timing configurations. It deals with merging multiple reset and reset request signals, synchronizes these signals (if necessary, based on the parameters), and manages early reset conditions. Its outputs are a synchronized reset signal and a reset request. It uses several internal parameters and wiring schemes to master the timing of the reset and reset requests as configured."

They are merged inside the module to create a single reset input.\n\n2. reset_req_in0 to reset_req_in15: These are corresponding reset request inputs for each direct reset input.\n\n3. clk: This is the clock signal which governs the synchronous logic inside the module.\n\n4. NUM_RESET_INPUTS, USE_RESET_REQUEST_INX (where X ranges from 0 to 15), OUTPUT_RESET_SYNC_EDGES, SYNC_DEPTH, RESET_REQUEST_PRESENT, RESET_REQ_WAIT_TIME, MIN_RST_ASSERTION_TIME, RESET_REQ_EARLY_DSRT_TIME, ADAPT_RESET_REQUEST: These are parameters that control aspects such as the number of resets, whether or not to use a reset request input, depths on synchronization, wait times, early de-assert times, etc.\n\nExplanation: Reset inputs are sources of hardware reset signals. These can come from different sources, like a user pressing a reset button, or another system module causing a reset. Reset request inputs are request signals for each reset input. The clock signal is for timing the synchronous behavior of the module. The parameters define the behavior and configuration of the module itself. \n\nOutput Ports: \n\n1. reset_out: This output represents the synchronized result of the combined reset input signals.\n\n2. reset_req: This output emits the early reset request signal representing the combined reset request input signals.\n\nExplanation: The reset output is a merged version of all input resets that is synchronized according to the parameters set. This signal is used by other modules to reset their states. The reset request signal is created in a similar way, used to signal other modules that a reset is going to happen soon."
