    "block_comment": "This is a block for configuring and managing the FIFO control registers based on incoming CSR write/read commands. On a reset, it initializes the control register and certain thresholds. During operation, it handles the Control Status Register (CSR) reads and writes. For read requests, it reads specific data from the addressed location and writes into csr_readdata. For write requests, it writes the incoming data to the mentioned address. This block handles five different CSR addresses, each associated with a specific control register. It ensures the fifo operation runs smoothly with orderly data movement and error prevention mechanisms."
