This block of code ensures that the `trc_jtag_addr` register is appropriately updated or reset based on various control signal updates. In each clock cycle, when there is a negative edge on `reset_n`, the `trc_jtag_addr` register is immediately reset to 0. Following a positive edge on `clk`, if `take_action_tracemem_a`, `take_no_action_tracemem_a`, or `take_action_tracemem_b` are high, the `trc_jtag_addr` register's value is updated according to the value of `jdo[35 : 19]` if `take_action_tracemem_a` is high, else it's incremented by 1.
