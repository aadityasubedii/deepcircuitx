    "block_comment": "The block is intended for assigning the next byte3 data value (av_ld_byte3_data_nxt) in the memory subsystem. The assignment depends on conditions of av_ld_rshift8 or av_ld_extend. If av_ld_rshift8 is true, the current av_ld_byte3_data is assigned. If av_ld_extend is true, the next byte3 data is assigned as a repetition of av_fill_bit for 8 times. Otherwise, the top 8 bits from d_readdata are selected and assigned as next byte3 data."
