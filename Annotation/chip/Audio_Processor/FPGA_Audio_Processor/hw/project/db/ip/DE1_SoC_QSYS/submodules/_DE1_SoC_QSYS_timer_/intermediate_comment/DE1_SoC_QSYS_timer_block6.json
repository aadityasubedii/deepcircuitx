    "block_comment": "This line of code is used for strobe signal assignment in the Verilog RTL design. Its function is to generate a snap_strobe signal based on the logical OR operation of snap_l_wr_strobe and snap_h_wr_strobe signals. This means that snap_strobe will be asserted when either snap_l_wr_strobe or snap_h_wr_strobe or both are asserted, creating an inclusive signal for both lower and higher write strobes. Thus, the operation simplifies and consolidates the control signals in the design."
