This line of code assigns the value of 'd_address' to 'cpu_d_address'. It is essentially a wire connection between two elements in the design, where 'cpu_d_address' gets updated whenever 'd_address' changes. This is a simple Verilog 'assign' statement, which is a continuous assignment that creates combinatorial logic or connections between nets.
