This Verilog code block is used to generate an interrupt request signal (irq). It uses bitwise OR operation ( | ) and bitwise AND operation ( & ) to determine the value of the irq. The irq is generated when at least one bit position marked by an interrupt mask (irq_mask) has captured a signal transition or change in the edge_capture signal.
