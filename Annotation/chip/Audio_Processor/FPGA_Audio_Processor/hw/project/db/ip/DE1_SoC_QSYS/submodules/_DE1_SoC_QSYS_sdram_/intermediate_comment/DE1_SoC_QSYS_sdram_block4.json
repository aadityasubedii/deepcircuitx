    "block_comment": "This block manages the reset and value update process of the 'za_valid' signal. If there is a falling edge on the 'reset_n' or a rising edge on the 'clk', the operations inside the block will be performed. If 'reset_n' is zero, 'za_valid' turns off, ensuring the system is in an initial state. On the other hand, when 'reset_n' is not zero, the 'za_valid' updates according to the most significant bit of the 'rd_valid' signal."
