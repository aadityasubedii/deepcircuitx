    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a resettable register in the design. Upon the negation of the reset (reset_n), ordinarily taking place at system initialization, the av_ld_byte0_data will be set to 0, thus setting the register to its default state. If this is not the case and the system doesn't receive a reset signal, with each positive edge of the system clock (clk), av_ld_byte0_data will instead be updated with the value stored in av_ld_byte0_data_nxt, thus achieving data synchronisation with respect to the system clock."
