    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a control register in a synchronous digital circuit, it operates primarily with respect to a positive clock edge (rising edge) but also resets on a falling edge (\"negedge\") of \"reset_n\" signal. The implementation details include conditional architecture. If the \"reset_n\" signal falls to 0, the control_register is reset to 0. Alternately, when the control write strobe (\"control_wr_strobe\") pulse is observed, the data from \"writedata\" signal (specifically the 4 least-significant bits) is written into the \"control_register\"."
