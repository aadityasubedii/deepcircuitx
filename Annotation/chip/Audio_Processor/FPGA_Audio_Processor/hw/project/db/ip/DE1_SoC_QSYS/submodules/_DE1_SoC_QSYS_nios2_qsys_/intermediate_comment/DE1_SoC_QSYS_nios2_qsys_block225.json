    "block_comment": "This block is a register assignment for 'D_valid' signal with synchronous reset. In each rising edge of the 'clk' or in the falling edge of 'reset_n', it checks the condition of 'reset_n'. If 'reset_n' is 0 which indicates active-low reset, it assigns 'D_valid' to 0 to initialize the signal. Otherwise, means in normal operation mode, 'D_valid' takes the value of 'F_valid'."
