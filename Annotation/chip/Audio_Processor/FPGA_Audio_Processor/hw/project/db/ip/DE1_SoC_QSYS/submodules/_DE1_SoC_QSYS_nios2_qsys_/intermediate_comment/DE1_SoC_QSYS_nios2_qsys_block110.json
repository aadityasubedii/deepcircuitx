    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a synchronous reset functionality for a custom control multi-register. If a negative reset occurs (reset_n = 0), it clears the control multi-register, resetting its value to 0. If there is no reset and the register enable signal (R_en) is high at a clock (clk) positive edge, the next state value (R_ctrl_custom_multi_nxt) is loaded into the control multi-register (R_ctrl_custom_multi). This process ensures that the register value gets updated continuously as per the input conditions."
