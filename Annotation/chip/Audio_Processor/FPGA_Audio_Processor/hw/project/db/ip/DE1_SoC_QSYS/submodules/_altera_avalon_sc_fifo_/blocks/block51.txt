This block sets up the implementation of a shift register. The else block construct labelled 'gen_blk9_else', containing a for loop, is used for implementing the shift operation. It loops through from '0' to 'DEPTH-1', shifting bits in the register rightwards, thus effectively achieving shift register functionality. The block offers a modular approach to defining shift registers, allowing easy adjustment of size (DEPTH) based on designer requirements.
