    "block_comment": "The block of code determines whether a breakpoint has been hit in any of the four possible breakpoints in a system. It does this by using a combination of OR operations on breakpoint flags. If any of the xbrk0_break_hit, xbrk1_break_hit, xbrk2_break_hit, or xbrk3_break_hit flags are high, it sets the xbrk_break_hit flag high, indicating that a breakpoint has been triggered."
