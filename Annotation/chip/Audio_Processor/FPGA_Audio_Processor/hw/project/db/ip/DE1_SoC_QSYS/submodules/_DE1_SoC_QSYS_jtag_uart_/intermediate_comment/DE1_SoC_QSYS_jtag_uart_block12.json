    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a module for a synchronized clear FIFO read operation as part of a JTAG UART system for the DE1 SoC QSYS system. It takes inputs such as the clock, a flag to clear the FIFO, a read flag, a reset flag, data, and a flag for writing to the receive FIFO. The module outputs whether the FIFO is empty, the read data from the FIFO, whether the receive FIFO is full and how much of the receive FIFO is used. All these are achieved by instantiating and wiring the \"DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_sim_scfifo_r\" module within this module."
