Comment: 
The block of code sets a binary flag indicating whether an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) operation is being performed or not. This operation is performed by the assignment "assign is_idct = 1'b0;". The "assign" keyword in Verilog, sets the value of "is_idct" flag to 0, meaning that IDCT operation is not currently being performed. The binary flag "is_idct" is global and can be accessed throughout the module.
