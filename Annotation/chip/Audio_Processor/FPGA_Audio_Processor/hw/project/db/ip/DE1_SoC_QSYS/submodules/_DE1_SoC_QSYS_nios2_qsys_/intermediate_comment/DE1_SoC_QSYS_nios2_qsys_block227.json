    "block_comment": "This Verilog block assigns a value to `F_iw` based on several conditional expressions. If `hbreak_req` is true, `F_iw` will be assigned the value 4040762. If `1'b0` (always false) is true, `F_iw` will be assigned 127034. If `intr_req` is true, `F_iw` will be assigned 3926074. Finally, if none of the previous conditions are met, `F_iw` will retain its current value."
