It mainly consists of a large memory array (`mem_array`) that mimics the behavior of a SDRAM module. It reads from a file named \"DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component.dat\" to initialize the memory array. It supports read operation (`q = mem_array[read_address];`) whenever the read address changes and write operations (`mem_array[wraddress] <= data;`) at the positive edge of the write clock when write enable (`wren`) signal is active. \n2. \n    - Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component\n    - Explanation: This module acts as a testbench controller for an SDRAM memory component by simulating different access patterns to the SDRAM module. It manipulates different signals (like command code, address, bank address, and data) to perform various memory operations. It also handles read and write masking, command code translation and latency management. The module includes an instance of DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module to simulate the actual memory operations. All of these manipulations and operations are synchronized with the system clock (`clk`)."
