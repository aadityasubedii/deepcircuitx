    "block_comment": "This block initializes the variable `instr_retired` to a boolean value of 0 (FALSE). It uses the `assign` keyword in Verilog to set the value. The assigned value denotes that no processor instruction has been completed or \"retired\" currently, which is used in indicating the current state of the system or controlling the further sequences of operations."
