    "block_comment": "Unfortunately, the block of code you shared seems to be incomplete. The `endgenerate` statement you provided suggests it was part of a generate block, typically used in Verilog to generate multiple instances of modules or to conditionally instantiate modules based on parameters.\n\nHowever, without more of the code, it's impossible to determine the specific function and implementation details of the corresponding block. Could you please share the full code block? I am happy to help with processing the raw data if you provide the full context."
