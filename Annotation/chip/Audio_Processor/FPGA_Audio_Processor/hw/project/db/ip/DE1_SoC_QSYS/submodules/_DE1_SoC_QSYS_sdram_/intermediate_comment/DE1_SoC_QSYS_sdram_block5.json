    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for defining a sequential logic circuit, with 'za_data' as the output. It performs the dual function of resetting the circuit and updating the value of 'za_data'. The operation is clocked, meaning changes occur only at the positive edge of the clock cycle or at the negative edge of 'reset_n'. If 'reset_n' is at a low level (0), 'za_data' is cleared (set to 0). Else, during a positive edge of the clock, 'za_data' takes the value of 'zs_dq'."
