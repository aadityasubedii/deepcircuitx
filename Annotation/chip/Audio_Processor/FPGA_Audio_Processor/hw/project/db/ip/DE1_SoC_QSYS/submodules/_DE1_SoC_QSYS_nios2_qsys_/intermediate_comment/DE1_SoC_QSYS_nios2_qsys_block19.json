    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assignment operation in Verilog, indicating the digital hardware design on a Register Transfer Level (RTL). It transfers the value of 'D_op_wrctl' signal onto 'D_ctrl_wrctl_inst' signal in every clock cycle. The 'D_op_wrctl' and 'D_ctrl_wrctl_inst' could represent data or control signals depending on the context of the overall design. The 'assign' keyword infers the hardware that ensures this transfer happens continuously, and the data propagation has no delay because it is purely combinational logic."
