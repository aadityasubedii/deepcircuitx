    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the enable signal of a FIFO having 11 as address. The block uses three conditions to trigger the enable signal. The first condition enables the FIFO when the write pointer equals 11 and the input signal ge1 is high. The second condition enables the FIFO when two conditions are met simultaneously: availability of ge2 (indicated by ge2_free signal) and the incremented write pointer equals 11 while input signal ge2 is high. The third condition is similar to the second one, albeit it checks for the availability of ge3 (ge3_free) and a twice incremented write pointer equating 11 when the input signal ge3 is high."
