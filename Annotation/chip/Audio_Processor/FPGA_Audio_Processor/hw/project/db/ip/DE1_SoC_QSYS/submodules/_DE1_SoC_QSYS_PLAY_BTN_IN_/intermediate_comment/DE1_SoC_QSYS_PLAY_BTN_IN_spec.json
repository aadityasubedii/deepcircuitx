It uses memory-mapped I/O to perform read, write, and control operations synchronously with a clock signal while supporting an active low reset functionality.\n\nThe module consists of seven input ports: a 2-bit 'address' to select specific registers for read/write operations, a single-bit 'chipselect' to enable the chip for I/O operations, 'clk' as an input clock signal for synchronization, 'in_port' to fetch the data to be processed, a reset signal 'reset_n' for resets, 'write_n' to denote a write operation, and a 32-bit 'writedata' for written data.\n\nIn terms of output, there are two ports: the 'irq' signal to request interruption and a 32-bit 'readdata' to output data during read operations.\n\nInternally, the module uses several signals to implement its functionality. 'clk_en' constantly enables the clock. 'read_mux_out' holds the output value from the multiplexer used in read operations. 'data_in', 'd1_data_in', and 'd2_data_in' are used for input data handling and edge detection. 'edge_detect' signifies an edge (button press) detection event. 'irq_mask' is the interrupt request management register. 'irq' is the internal interrupt request signal. 'edge_capture', along with 'edge_capture_wr_strobe', handles edge capturing events circumstantially. 'readdata' holds the data during read operations.\n\nThe code consists of distinct blocks for different operations: read operations (based on multiplexing), data input handling, interrupt mask adjustments, interrupt request and edge capture management, and edge detection. Each of these blocks takes actions based on specific conditions and contributes to the overall functionality of the module, from detecting a button press to managing data read/write operations.",

Its value depends on the address input value and is used as an input to set the 'readdata' value.\n\n3. data_in: This wired signal is assigned the value of the input port in_port and it is used to populate the 'readdata' output depending on the address and the value of other internal signals.\n\n4. d1_data_in, d2_data_in: These are multistage (2-stage) signals used to detect the edge of data_in.
