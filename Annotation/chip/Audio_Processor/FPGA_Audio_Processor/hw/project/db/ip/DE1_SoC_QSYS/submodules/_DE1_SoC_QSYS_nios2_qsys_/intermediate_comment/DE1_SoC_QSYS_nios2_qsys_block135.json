    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the signal 'W_wr_data' the value of 'W_wr_data_non_zero'. This operation is done by an assign statement in Verilog, which will continuously drive the 'W_wr_data' signal with the value of 'W_wr_data_non_zero'. Whenever there's a change in 'W_wr_data_non_zero', the change will be efficiently propagated to 'W_wr_data'. It uses the power of hardware parallelism captured in declarative hardware description languages like Verilog."
