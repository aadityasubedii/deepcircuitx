    "block_comment": "This line of code functions to assign a default value of 0 to the variable 'xbrk1_goto0_hit'. As a basic assignment operation in Verilog, it means that in every clock cycle, a value of 0 is continuously assigned to this variable and it'll hold this value until a different value is explicitly assigned to it later on in the code."
