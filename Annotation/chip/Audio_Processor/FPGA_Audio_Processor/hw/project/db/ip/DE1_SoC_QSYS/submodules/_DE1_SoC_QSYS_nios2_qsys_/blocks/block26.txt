This block of Verilog RTL code handles the reset and clock functionality for a control bit 'R_ctrl_b_is_dst'. Upon receiving a reset signal (when 'reset_n' is 0), the control bit is set to 0. During the positive edge of the clock, if the enable signal 'R_en' is high, the current state of the control bit 'R_ctrl_b_is_dst' is updated to its next state 'R_ctrl_b_is_dst_nxt'. It incorporates the usage of flip-flops and is typically used for sequenced logic design, like Finite State Machines (FSMs) or as a storage element in a register.
