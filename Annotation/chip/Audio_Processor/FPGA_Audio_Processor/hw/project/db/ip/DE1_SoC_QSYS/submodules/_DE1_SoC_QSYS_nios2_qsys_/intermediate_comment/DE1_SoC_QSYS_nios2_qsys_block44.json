    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a synchronous reset logic for a control branch comparator. On the rising edge of the clock signal (clk) or falling edge of the reset signal (reset_n), the code assigns a new value to the variable R_ctrl_br_cmp. If the reset_n signal is low, the variable R_ctrl_br_cmp is reset to 0. Else, if a write enable (R_en) is asserted, the next comparable value for the control branch (R_ctrl_br_cmp_nxt) is assigned to the variable R_ctrl_br_cmp, thus preparing it for the next comparison cycle."
