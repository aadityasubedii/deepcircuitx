    "block_comment": "The Verilog code block assigns a next-state value to `av_ld_byte1_data_nxt`. It chooses the value based on two conditions which are evaluated using ternary operators. If `av_ld_rshift8` is asserted (true), the value of `av_ld_byte2_data` is assigned. Otherwise, if `av_ld_extend` is asserted, the 8-bit vector `av_fill_bit` is replicated 8 times and assigned. If neither condition is met, the 8-bit vector consisting of bits 8 through 15 of `d_readdata` is assigned to `av_ld_byte1_data_nxt`.\n"
