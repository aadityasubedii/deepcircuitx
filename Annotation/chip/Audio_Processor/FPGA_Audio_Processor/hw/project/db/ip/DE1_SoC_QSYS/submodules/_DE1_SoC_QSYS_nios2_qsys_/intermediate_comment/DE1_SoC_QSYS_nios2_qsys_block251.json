    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the state of an address register in a synchronous digital system. The register is controlled by a positive edge-triggered clock and an active-low reset signal. When the reset signal (jrst_n) is pulled low, the address value is reset to 0. Otherwise, the address register's value (address) is updated to the next address value (address_nxt) on each clock rising edge."
