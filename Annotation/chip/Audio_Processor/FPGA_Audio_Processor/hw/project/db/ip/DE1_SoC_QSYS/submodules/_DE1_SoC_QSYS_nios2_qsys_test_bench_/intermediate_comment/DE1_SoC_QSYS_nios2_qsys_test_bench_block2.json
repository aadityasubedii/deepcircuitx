    "block_comment": "This block is designed to perform a synchronous reset or execute an operation during positive edge of clock. It uses synchronous reset logic, where if reset_n signal is low, all operations are halted. If reset_n is not low (implying no reset condition), it checks for both 'W_valid' and 'R_ctrl_ld' to be high and if the bitwise XOR on 'av_ld_data_aligned_unfiltered' is undefined, it issues a warning indicating that 'av_ld_data_aligned_unfiltered' is undefined during the particular clock cycle."
