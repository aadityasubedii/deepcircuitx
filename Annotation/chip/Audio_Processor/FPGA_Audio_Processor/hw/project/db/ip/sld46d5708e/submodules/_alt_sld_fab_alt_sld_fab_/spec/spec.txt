I'm sorry, but it's impossible to provide a detailed specification for the given module. The provided text does not represent a valid Verilog RTL code. The symbols presented in the code are not part of the ASCII characters used in Verilog code. 

Thus, there is no possible way to determine the module name, its functionality, the input and output ports or any internal signals used. Also, itâ€™s not possible to process this raw data or extract any sort of valid information from it. Please provide valid Verilog RTL code.
