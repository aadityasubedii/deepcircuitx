    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for assigning the value of `D_ctrl_hi_imm16` to `R_ctrl_hi_imm16_nxt` in the next cycle. It makes use of the `assign` keyword in Verilog which continuously assigns the value of the right-hand expression (here `D_ctrl_hi_imm16`) to the left-hand register (here `R_ctrl_hi_imm16_nxt`)."
