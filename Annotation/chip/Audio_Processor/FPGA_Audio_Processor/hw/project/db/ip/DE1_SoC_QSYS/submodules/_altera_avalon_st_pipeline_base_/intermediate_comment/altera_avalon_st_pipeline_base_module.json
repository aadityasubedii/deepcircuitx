    "module": "Module-level comment: The altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base module is a two-stage data pipeline implemented in Verilog that buffers and transfers data based on ready-valid handshaking. It operates in either a registered (PIPELINE_READY=1) or unregistered mode, controlled by internal flag signals (full0, full1) and data registers (data0, data1). Input/output data flow is managed through in_data/out_data ports in conjunction with valid-ready signals (in_valid/out_valid and in_ready/out_ready)."
