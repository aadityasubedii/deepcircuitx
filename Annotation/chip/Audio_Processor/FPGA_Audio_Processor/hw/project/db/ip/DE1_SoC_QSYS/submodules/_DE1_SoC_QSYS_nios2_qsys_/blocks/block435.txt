Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code is used for signal assignment. It assigns the signal 'xbrk3_toff_hit' a constant value of zero. This operation means that the signal 'xbrk3_toff_hit' will always hold the 0 value regardless of any other logic or computation in the entire design till it's re-assigned. It might be used as a default or init value for the signal.
