    "block_comment": "This block creates an overflow pending signal assignment. By using the assign command, the block generates a concatenation of the current 'overflow_pending' state and the 35 least significant bits of the 'atm' signal. The result is a new binary number assigned to 'overflow_pending_atm', reflecting the potential overflow event and its associated 'atm' data."
