    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the `W_rf_wren` register that indicates whether write enable should be active or not. It does this by performing a bitwise AND operation between `R_wr_dst_reg` and `W_valid` or it sets the `W_rf_wren` to true if `reset_n` is not active. The assign statement ensures that `W_rf_wren` always reflects the latest states of `R_wr_dst_reg`, `W_valid`, and `reset_n`."
