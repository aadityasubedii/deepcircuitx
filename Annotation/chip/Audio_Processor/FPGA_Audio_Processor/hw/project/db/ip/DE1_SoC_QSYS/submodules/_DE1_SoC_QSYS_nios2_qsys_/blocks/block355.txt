Comment: 
This line of code assigns the value of a specific part of the `trc_ctrl` vector to the variable `sync_code`. It implements this by using the `assign` keyword from Verilog, which is used to create continuous assignments, and specifying the slice of `trc_ctrl` with the `[3 : 2]` expression, which selects bits 3 and 2 from the `trc_ctrl` vector. The selected bits are then assigned to `sync_code`.
