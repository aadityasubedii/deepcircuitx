    "block_comment": "This block of code deals with the writing and reading from an array memory 'mem' in a synchronous clocking system. On every positive edge of the clock, if 'in_valid' and 'in_ready' signals are asserted, it writes 'in_payload' to the 'mem' at the location specified by 'wr_ptr'. Simultaneously, the payload from the 'mem' located at 'mem_rd_ptr' is read into 'internal_out_payload'."
