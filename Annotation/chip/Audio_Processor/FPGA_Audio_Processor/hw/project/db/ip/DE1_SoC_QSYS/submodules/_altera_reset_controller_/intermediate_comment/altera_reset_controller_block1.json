    "block_comment": "The given block of code in Verilog deals with outputting the synchronous and early reset signals, `r_sync_rst` and `r_early_rst`, respectively. The block employs an always@* block, which gets triggered on any change in any of the inputs of the block, effectively assigning the two signals `reset_out` and `reset_req` to synchronous reset `r_sync_rst` and early reset `r_early_rst` signals respectively. This serves as an essential mechanism for controlling the reset states."
