    "block_comment": "This block of code is assigning values to various read parameters based on the current status of system latency and activated mask. The first two lines are using ternary operators to check the truthiness of the respective mask bit. If the bit in mask is set, that particular byte in the `read_temp` is set to high impedance ('z') state, effectively making it unresponsive. Otherwise, it assigns the corresponding bits of `read_data` to `read_temp`. The `read_addr`, `read_mask`, and `read_valid` parameters are assigned based on the value of `index`, which itself is set based on the latency of the system. Finally, the `zs_dq` is set to `read_temp` if `read_valid` is true, otherwise it is set to a high impedance state."
