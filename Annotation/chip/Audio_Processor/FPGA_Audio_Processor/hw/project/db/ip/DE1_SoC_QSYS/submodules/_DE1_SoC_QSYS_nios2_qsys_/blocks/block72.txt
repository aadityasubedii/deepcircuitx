This block is performing an assignment operation in a digital logic circuit. It takes the current state of the `D_ctrl_shift_rot_right` signal and assigns it to the next state of `R_ctrl_shift_rot_right_nxt`. This transfer of signal value often represents a shift or update in a state machine within the design.
