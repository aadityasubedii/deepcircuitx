    "block_comment": "This code block is an assignment operation in Verilog controlling an indirect jump operation in the design. Specifically, the value of 'D_ctrl_jmp_indirect' in the current state is assigned to 'R_ctrl_jmp_indirect_nxt' for the next state, following the flow of a pipeline architecture. This is a typical control flow management operation in pipelined processor designs."
