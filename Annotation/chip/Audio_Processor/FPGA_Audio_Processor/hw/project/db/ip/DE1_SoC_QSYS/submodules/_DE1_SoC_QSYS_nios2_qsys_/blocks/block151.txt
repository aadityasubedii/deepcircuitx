This block implements a flip-flop for synchronous data loading and asynchronous reset. The operation of this block is determined by two signals: a clock (`clk`) and a negative-edge reset (`reset_n`). On a negative edge of `reset_n`, it resets (`av_ld_aligning_data` becomes 0), ensuring the system is in a known state. On a positive edge of `clk` (and when `reset_n` is not 0), it loads data from `av_ld_aligning_data_nxt` into `av_ld_aligning_data`, providing controlled data flow for the system.
