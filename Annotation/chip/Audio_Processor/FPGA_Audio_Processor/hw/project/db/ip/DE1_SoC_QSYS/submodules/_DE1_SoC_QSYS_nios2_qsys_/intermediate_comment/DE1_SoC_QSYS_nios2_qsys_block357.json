    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block assigns a fixed value to a signal. The code uses the 'assign' keyword to continuously assign the 32-bit binary value of '0' to the signal 'exc_addr'. This implies that the signal 'exc_addr' will always hold the value of 0 throughout the execution of the program, symbolizing that it could act as a constant zero signal in the system's design."
