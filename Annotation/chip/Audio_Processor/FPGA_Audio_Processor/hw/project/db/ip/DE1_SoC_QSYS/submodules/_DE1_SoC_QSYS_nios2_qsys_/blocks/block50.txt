Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for controlling the subtraction operation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using a synchronous reset and a clock signal. When a negative edge reset occurs (i.e., `reset_n` equals to 0), the ALU is set to not perform any subtraction operation by setting `R_ctrl_alu_subtract` to 0. If there's no reset and on positive edge of the clock, if `R_en` is high (enabled), the block updates `R_ctrl_alu_subtract` to the next state stored in `R_ctrl_alu_subtract_nxt`, which means it's prepared to execute a substract operation in the next clock cycle.
