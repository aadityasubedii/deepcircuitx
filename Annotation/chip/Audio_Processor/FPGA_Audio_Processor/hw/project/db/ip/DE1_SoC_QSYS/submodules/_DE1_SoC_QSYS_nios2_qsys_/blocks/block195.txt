Comment: 
The block is responsible for performing bitwise arithmetic operations based on the value of 'R_logic_op'. It implements bitwise NOT, AND, OR, and XOR operations. If 'R_logic_op' is '2'b00', it performs a NOR operation on 'E_src1' and 'E_src2'. If 'R_logic_op' is '2'b01', it performs an AND operation. If 'R_logic_op' is '2'b10', it performs an OR operation. For any other value, an XOR operation is performed on 'E_src1' and 'E_src2'.
