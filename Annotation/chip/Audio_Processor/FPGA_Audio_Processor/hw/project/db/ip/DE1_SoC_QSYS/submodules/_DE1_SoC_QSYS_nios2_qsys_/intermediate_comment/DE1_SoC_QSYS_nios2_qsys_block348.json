    "block_comment": "The provided block of code is a synchronous logic that produces a control signal for the trace clear command. Upon the rise of the clock signal (clk) or the fall of the jrst_n signal, the code block checks if jrst_n is zero. If it is, it sets the trc_clear signal to 0, thus clearing the trace command. If jrst_n is not zero, trc_clear is set to the bitwise AND of the negation of trc_enb, with the logical AND of take_action_tracectrl and the 5th bit of the jdo register. This documents an extra condition for activating trace clear function, based on the states of the trc_enb, take_action_tracectrl and jdo[4]."
