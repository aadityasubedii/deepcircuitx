Comment: 
This block of Verilog code implements a synchronous reset functionality for a shift and rotate operation result stored in the signal 'E_shift_rot_result'. The block is sensitive to both the positive edge of the clock signal 'clk' and the negative edge of the reset signal 'reset_n'. If 'reset_n' goes low, the 'E_shift_rot_result' is reset to zero, otherwise, it is updated with the value from 'E_shift_rot_result_nxt' on the positive clock edge. This implementation ensures that the shift and rotate result can be reset immediately in any cycle when required.
