    "block_comment": "This Verilog line is used to control the enabling of a trace memory module. Specifically, it directly assigns the value of `trc_enb` to `tracemem_on`. As such, whenever `trc_enb` is active (usually high, or 1, in digital logic), the trace memory module is turned on as indicated by `tracemem_on` being high (or 1). Conversely, when `trc_enb` is not active (low, or 0), the trace memory module is turned off. This is a basic means of controlling the operational state of a module in digital logic design."
