    "block_comment": "The block is a synchronous counter with options for reset and reload. On the falling edge of a reset signal, the counter resets to a predefined value (0x22E97). If a reload is forced or the counter is running, the counter either reloads the count to a new value (counter_load_value) or continues to decrement the value of the internal_counter by 1 each clock cycle."
