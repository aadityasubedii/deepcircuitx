    "block_comment": "The block handles multiple specifically-stated load operations intended for I/O processing. Using bitwise OR operation, it detects whether any of the load operations (D_op_ldbuio, D_op_ldhuio, D_op_ldbio, D_op_ldhio, D_op_ldwio, D_op_rsv63) are activated and assigns the result to D_ctrl_ld_io. With this implementation, the control signal D_ctrl_ld_io is set high whenever there is a request for any of the relevant load operations."
