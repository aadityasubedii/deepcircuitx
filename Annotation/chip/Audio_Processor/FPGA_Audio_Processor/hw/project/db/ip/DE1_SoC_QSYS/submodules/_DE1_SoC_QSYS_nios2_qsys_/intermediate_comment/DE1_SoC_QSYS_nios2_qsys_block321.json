    "block_comment": "The block assigns the output of a multiplexer to the head of a FIFO (First In, First Out) queue. This is achieved by using an 'assign' statement, which denotes continuous assignment in Verilog. The right-hand side 'fifo_read_mux' could be a multiplexer that chooses either the read pointer or write pointer based on the 'read' or 'write' signals, which would then get assigned to the 'fifo_head'. The intent of this block is likely to update the head pointer of the FIFO based on the state of the fifo_read_mux."
