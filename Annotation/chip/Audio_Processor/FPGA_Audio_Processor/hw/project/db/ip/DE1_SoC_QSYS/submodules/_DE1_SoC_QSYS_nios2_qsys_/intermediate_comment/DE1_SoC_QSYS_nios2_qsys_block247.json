    "block_comment": "This block manages the state of a 'read' flag, which is influenced by the state of a clock signal 'clk', a reset signal 'jrst_n', a wait request signal 'waitrequest', and a next-read command 'read_nxt'. Whenever a positive-edge clock cycle or a negative-edge reset is detected, an operation is evaluated: if 'jrst_n' equals 0 (indicating reset), the read flag is set to 0. Otherwise, the read flag is set according to whether a wait request is active. If it is, then the previous state of 'read' is maintained, otherwise, the state of 'read' is determined by 'read_nxt'."
