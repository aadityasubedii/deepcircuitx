The block of code assigns a 'not' version of the ninth bit of the "MonARegAddrInc" to the "MonARegAddrIncAccessingRAM". In other words, it's inverting the value of the ninth bit from the "MonARegAddrInc" and assigning it to "MonARegAddrIncAccessingRAM". This can be used to check if the RAM is being accessed, given that the ninth bit might signify RAM access in the original design.
