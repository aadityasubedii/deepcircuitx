Module-level comment: This module implements a test bench for the Nios II processor in the DE1-SoC QSYS system. It monitors processor signals, performs error checking, and verifies correct functionality by:
1. Decoding and checking instruction operations
2. Validating signal integrity and timing
3. Filtering load data to handle undefined values
4. Checking memory access operations and data alignment
5. Monitoring register operations and write-back
The test bench uses numerous input signals from the processor and provides filtered load data as output, stopping simulation on detected errors.
