This code is a sequential logic block for controlling a FIFO memory module in a hardware design. The block is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of the reset signal `reset_n`. During a reset signal (when `reset_n` is low), the `fifo_5` is reset to 0. Otherwise, if the `fifo_5_enable` signal is high during a clock pulse, the `fifo_5` value will be updated with the value from `fifo_5_mux`.
