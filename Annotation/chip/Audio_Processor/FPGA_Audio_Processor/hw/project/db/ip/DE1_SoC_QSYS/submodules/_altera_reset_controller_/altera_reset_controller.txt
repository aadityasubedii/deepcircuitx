Module-level comment: The altera_reset_controller module manages and synchronizes multiple reset signals in a hardware system. It processes up to 16 reset and respective request inputs to generate a unified reset_out and reset_req output. The implementation uses parameters for customization, including the number of resets, wait times, and synchronization depth. Internal signals and complex synchronization logic handle timing, merging, and synchronization of inputs to generate the final output signals. The module supports the flexible resetting of systems with multiple reset triggers.
