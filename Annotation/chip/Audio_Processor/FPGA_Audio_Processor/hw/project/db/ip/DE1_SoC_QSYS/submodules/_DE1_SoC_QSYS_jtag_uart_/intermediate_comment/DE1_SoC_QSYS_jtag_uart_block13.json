    "block_comment": "This block of code appears to be setting up various flags and parameters for a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memory buffer used in digital systems. The 'fifo_EF' flag is set true (1) when no bytes are left in the FIFO. The 'rfifo_full' flag becomes true if the remaining bytes exceed a count of 64 (hex 40). The 'rfifo_entries' count represents the actual entries in the FIFO, being either the maximum capacity of 64 when full, or else just the count of remaining bytes. The 'rfifo_used' is a flag used for storing the lower 6 bits of the 'rfifo_entries' variable. The flags 'new_rom', 'num_bytes', and 'fifo_rdata' are reset to 0."
