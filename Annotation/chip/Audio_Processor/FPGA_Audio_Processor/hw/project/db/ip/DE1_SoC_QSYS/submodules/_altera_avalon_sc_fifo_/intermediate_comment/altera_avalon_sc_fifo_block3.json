    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the current start of packet pointer (`curr_sop_ptr`). The assignment depends on whether a write operation is taking place and if the input flag `in_startofpacket` and `in_endofpacket` are both in the high state (usually represents binary 1). If these conditions are met, the write pointer (`wr_ptr`) is assigned to the `curr_sop_ptr`, otherwise the previously stored start of packet pointer (`sop_ptr`) is used. It is essentially a conditional assignment in a single line dictated by the status of a packet being written."
