    "block_comment": "The block of code handles an exception control signal in a Verilog digital system design. Specifically, the operation assignment (`assign`) passes the current exception control status from `D_ctrl_exception` to `R_ctrl_exception_nxt`. This process represents a simple pass-through mechanism of the exception status from one cycle to the next."
