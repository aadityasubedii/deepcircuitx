    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_reset_synchronizer` module aligns an input reset signal with a given clock signal and outputs a synchronized reset signal. The alignment is accomplished using a chain of flip-flops, the number of which is defined by a `DEPTH` parameter. This module handles both asynchronous and synchronous resets determined by the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter. Internally, it employs a register array `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` for the reset synchronization chain state and another signal `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out` to output the synchronized reset signal. Depending on the `ASYNC_RESET` value, the synchronization process may be initiated immediately or deferred until the next clock edge."
