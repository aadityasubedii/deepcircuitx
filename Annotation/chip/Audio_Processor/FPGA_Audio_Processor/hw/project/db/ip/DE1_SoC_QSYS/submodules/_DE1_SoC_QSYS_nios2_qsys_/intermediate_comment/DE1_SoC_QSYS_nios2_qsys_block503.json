    "block_comment": "This block manages control signals for a monitor in a digital system. At a high-level, it resets the monitor status signals (`monitor_ready`, `monitor_error`, `monitor_go`) when `jrst_n` is low, or updates these signals based on specific system states (designated by `take_action_ocimem_a`, `jdo[25]`, `take_action_ocireg`, `ocireg_mrs`, `jdo[23]`, `st_ready_test_idle` etc.) during a clock rising edge when `jrst_n` is high. The operations are grouped in an `always` block and the signals are set using non-blocking assignments for optimal signal propagation and prevention of race conditions."
