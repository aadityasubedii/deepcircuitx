    "block_comment": "This block performs bit negation on a signal `x1` using a synchronous reset. The operation is synchronous with the rising edge of the `clk` signal and also tied with the falling edge of the `jrst_n` signal which acts as a reset. When `jrst_n` is not high, it resets `x1` to 0. Otherwise during a clock rising edge, it negates the signal `x1`."
