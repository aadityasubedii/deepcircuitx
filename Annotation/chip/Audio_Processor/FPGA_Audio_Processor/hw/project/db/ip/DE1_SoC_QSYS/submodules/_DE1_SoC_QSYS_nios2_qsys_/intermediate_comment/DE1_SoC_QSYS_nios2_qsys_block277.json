    "block_comment": "This block enables the 14th FIFO when certain conditions are met. The FIFO is enabled whenever FIFO write pointer equals 14 and input_ge1 is active, or, if ge2_free is high and FIFO write pointer incremented by 1 equals 14 along with input_ge2 being active, or, if ge3_free is enabled and FIFO write pointer incremented by 2 equals 14 whilst input_ge3 is high. Its role is to manage FIFO write operations under different conditions ensuring proper sequencing and allocation."
