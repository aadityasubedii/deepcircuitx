    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for generating the itm_valid signal flag. This flag is assigned with the bitwise OR operation of bits 32 to 35 of the itm bit-vector. The '|' operator is used to perform this bitwise OR operation, checking if any of the bits in the range 32 to 35 of the itm vector are '1', leading to the signal itm_valid being set to '1'. If all the bits in the same range are '0', itm_valid will be set to '0'."
