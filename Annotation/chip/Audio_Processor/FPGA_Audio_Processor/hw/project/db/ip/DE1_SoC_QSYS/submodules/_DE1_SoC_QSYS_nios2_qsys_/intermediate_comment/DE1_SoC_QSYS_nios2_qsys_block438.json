    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a constant value of 0 to the wire `xbrk2_goto1_hit`. The use of the `assign` keyword in Verilog means that this is a continuous assignment statement, which means `xbrk2_goto1_hit` is always 0. \u0ca0_\u0ca0 This is a simple and implementation independent way of setting a default or initial state for a wire or a register in a hardware description language like Verilog."
