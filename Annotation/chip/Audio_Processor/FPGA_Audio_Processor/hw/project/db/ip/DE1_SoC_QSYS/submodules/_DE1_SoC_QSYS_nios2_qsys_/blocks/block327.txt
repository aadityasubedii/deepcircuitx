This block performs a logic operation to determine if the element 'ge3_free' is free or not. It does this by taking a bitwise AND of 'ge2_free' with the bitwise negation of a 4-bit section (from the 0th to the 3rd least significant bit) of the 'fifo_cnt' variable. Essentially, it implies that 'ge3_free' will be free only if 'ge2_free' is free and none of the 4 least significant bits of 'fifo_cnt' are set.
