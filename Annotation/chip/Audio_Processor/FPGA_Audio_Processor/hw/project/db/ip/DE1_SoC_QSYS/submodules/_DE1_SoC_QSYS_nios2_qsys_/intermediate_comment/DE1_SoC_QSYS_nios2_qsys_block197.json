    "block_comment": "The block implements an arithmetic operation, specifically either addition or subtraction, depending on the binary value of E_alu_sub. If E_alu_sub is true (1), then the operation is subtraction (E_arith_src1 - E_arith_src2), if it is false (0), the operation is addition (E_arith_src1 + E_arith_src2). The result of the operation is assigned to E_arith_result."
