Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code assigns the value of `cpu_i_address`. It does this by concatenating the value of a register `F_pc` and appending two least significant zero bits to form the binary value which is subsequently assigned to `cpu_i_address`. This means that final value of `cpu_i_address` is effectively 4 times the value of `F_pc`, as it shifts the binary value of `F_pc` to the left by two bits.
