Comment: 
This block of code creates a write strobe for edge capture, triggered by certain conditions. The `edge_capture_wr_strobe` signal is assigned based on the conjunction of `chipselect`, the negation of `write_n`, and whether the `address` equals 3. This means the strobe triggers when the chip is selected, a write operation is desired, and the targeted address is 3.
