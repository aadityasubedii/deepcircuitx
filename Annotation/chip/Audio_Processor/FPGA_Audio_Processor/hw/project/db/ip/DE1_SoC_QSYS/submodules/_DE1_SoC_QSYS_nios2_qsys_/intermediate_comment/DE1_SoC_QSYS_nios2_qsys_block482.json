    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a flip-flop for the 'oci_single_step_mode' signal with asynchronous reset and conditional synchronous load functionalities. On the rising edge of the clock, the signal 'oci_single_step_mode' is either reset to 0 when 'reset_n' is negated, or updated to the value of 'ocireg_sstep' if 'take_action_ocireg' is true. The asynchronous reset ensures the 'oci_single_step_mode' signal is immediately reset regardless of the clock state whenever 'reset_n' is negated. Meanwhile, the conditional synchronous load allows for selective updating of 'oci_single_step_mode' based on the state of 'take_action_ocireg' during the clock's rising edge."
