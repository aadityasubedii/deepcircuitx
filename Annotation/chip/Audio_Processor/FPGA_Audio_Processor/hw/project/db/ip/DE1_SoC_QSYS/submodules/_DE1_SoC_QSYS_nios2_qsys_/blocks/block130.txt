This block is responsible for controlling the write operations on the E-stage register. It assigns the value of E_wrctl_estatus based on a logical operation between R_ctrl_wrctl_inst and the condition where D_iw_control_regnum is equal to 1 in its 3-bit binary representation. The assignment operation happens only when both conditions are met, ensuring only specific conditions manipulate the E-stage register.
