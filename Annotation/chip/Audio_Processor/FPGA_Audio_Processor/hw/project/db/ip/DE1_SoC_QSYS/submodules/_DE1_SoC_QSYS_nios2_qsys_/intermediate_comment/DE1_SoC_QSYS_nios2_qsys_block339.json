    "block_comment": "This block of code performs bit-wise OR operation to pad zero bits to certain positions of cpu_d_address. In this block, the RTL model assigns a new value to the variable 'cpu_d_address_0_padded' by performing a bit-wise OR operation with a 32-bit zero, effectively padding 'cpu_d_address' with zeroes."
