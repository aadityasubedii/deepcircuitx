This block of code defines a non-blocking assignment in Verilog, setting the `is_exception_no_break` signal/variable to a constant `1'b0`. It is essentially initializing or setting this variable to a default state of binary '0'. This kind of construct is used when there is a need to assign a specific value to a net or variable, concurrently alongside other operations. If there are exceptions present that don't interrupt the overall system flow or don't result in breaks, they are denoted by this specific `is_exception_no_break` variable which is assigned the value of '0'.
