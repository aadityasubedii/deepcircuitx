Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_mm_interconnect_0. Module specification: This module serves as an interconnect component for a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, likely implemented on a DE1-SoC FPGA board. It manages communication between various system components, including the NIOS II processor, memory interfaces (SDRAM, on-chip memory), and peripheral devices (JTAG UART, timer, buttons, etc.). The module has numerous input and output ports, including clock and reset signals, address, control, and data signals for the NIOS II processor's data and instruction masters, and various slave components. It utilizes internal signals for Avalon interfaces, response multiplexers, and agent communications. The module is structured with several key sections, including master and slave agents, routers, demultiplexers, multiplexers, and width adapters
