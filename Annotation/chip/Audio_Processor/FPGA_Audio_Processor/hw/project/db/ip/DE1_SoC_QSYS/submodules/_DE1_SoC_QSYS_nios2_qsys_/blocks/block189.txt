This block of code assigns the boolean value of `E_shift_rot_done`, indicating whether a shift or rotate operation is completed. The operation is considered complete (`E_shift_rot_done` is TRUE) when the `E_shift_rot_cnt` is zero and a new instruction is not being processed (`E_new_inst` is FALSE).
