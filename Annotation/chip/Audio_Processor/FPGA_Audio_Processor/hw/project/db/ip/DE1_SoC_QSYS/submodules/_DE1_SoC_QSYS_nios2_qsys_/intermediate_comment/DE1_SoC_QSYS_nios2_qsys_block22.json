    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to determine if the second source operand, for the instruction defined in the verilog code, is an immediate value or should be fetched from the register file. This is achieved by logically OR'ing all the OP codes which require immediate data such as 'addi', 'andi', etc. If any of these instruction types is active, the variable 'D_ctrl_src2_choose_imm' will be set, indicating that immediate data should be used for the second operand."
