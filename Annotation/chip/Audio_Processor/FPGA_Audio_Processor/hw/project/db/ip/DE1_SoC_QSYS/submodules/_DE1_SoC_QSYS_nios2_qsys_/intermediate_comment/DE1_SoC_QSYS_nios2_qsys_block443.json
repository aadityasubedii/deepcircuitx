    "block_comment": "This block assigns a constant value of zero to the signal `xbrk2_break_hit`. This is achieved simply through the use of the `assign` keyword in Verilog, which is used for continuous assignments. The signal `xbrk2_break_hit` will remain zero till another value is assigned to it. This phrase should work as a continuous assignment in the RTL description."
