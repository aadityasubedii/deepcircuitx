    "block_comment": "This block manages the reset operation of a data simulation module. On the rising edge of the clock signal, it resets the pause and enable signals for both the transmitter (sim_t) and receiver (sim_r) to their idle state (0). Additionally, it conditional sets the data signal (sim_t_dat) for the transmitter based on the availability (t_dav) of data (r_dat), replacing it with replicated value bits (r_val) if not available.\n"
