    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for conducting a state reset or a Write Operation. When the \"reset_n\" is not high (indicating the occurrence of a reset event), the block is cleared. In the case of a Write Operation, it is carried out when both \"W_valid\" and \"R_wr_dst_reg\" flags are set. If, in the event of the execution of a Write Operation, the provided write data \"W_wr_data\" results in an ambiguous or uninitialized state, it throws a dynamic warning logging the time of the event, illustrating that the write data holds an 'x' or uninitialized value."
