This block of code controls the enabling of the CPU address. It uses a simple assignment operation where the enable signal for the CPU address (D_cpu_addr_en) is assigned the value of 'D_valid'. This means the CPU address becomes enabled whenever D_valid is high (true), allowing the CPU to operate on the current address.
