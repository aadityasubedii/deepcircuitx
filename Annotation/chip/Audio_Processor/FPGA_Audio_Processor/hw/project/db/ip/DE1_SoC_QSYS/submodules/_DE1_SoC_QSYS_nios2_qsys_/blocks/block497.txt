Comment: 
This line of Verilog code enables the write operation of the Avalon RAM interface. The write operation is conditional upon three factors: the write control signal (`write`), the 9th bit of the address line (`address[8]`) having a logical LOW value (signified by `~address[8]`), and the debugging access signal (`debugaccess`). These three conditions are logically concatenated using the bitwise AND operator (`&`), meaning all conditions must be true (i.e., HIGH for bitwise operations) for a write operation to be initiated.
