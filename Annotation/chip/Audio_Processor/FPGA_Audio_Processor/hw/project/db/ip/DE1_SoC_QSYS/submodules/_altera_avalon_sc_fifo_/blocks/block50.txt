The block is a reset and write memory controller in asynchronous operation. Upon clock's positive edge or trigger from a reset signal, it first checks if the reset signal is high. In case of a reset, it clears the corresponding memory slot indexed by 'i'. If not a reset condition, it examines the read signal or the status of the memory slot. When the memory slot is unused or read operation is selected, it decides to write the input payload to the memory slot if the next slot is not used or shift the data from the next memory slot if it's being utilized.
