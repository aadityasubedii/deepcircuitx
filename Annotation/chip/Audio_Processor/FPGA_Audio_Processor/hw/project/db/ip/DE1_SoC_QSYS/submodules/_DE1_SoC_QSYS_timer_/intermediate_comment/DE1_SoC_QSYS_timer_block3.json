    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the write strobe of a certain storage or data block. The write strobe is activated when three conditions are met: when the chip is selected (indicated by 'chipselect' being logic High), it is a write operation (significantly specified by '~write_n' being logic High), and the address matched is 1 (stated by 'address == 1'). When all of these conditions are true, the 'control_wr_strobe' signal is set to logic High."
