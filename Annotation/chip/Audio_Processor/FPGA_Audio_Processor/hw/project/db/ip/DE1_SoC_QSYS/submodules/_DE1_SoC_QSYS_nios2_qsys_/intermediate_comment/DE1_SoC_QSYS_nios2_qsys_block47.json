    "block_comment": "This is a D-type flip-flop with asynchronous reset used for controlling ALU signed comparison operation. On a negative edge reset, the output 'R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison' is set to zero irrespective of other conditions. It updates the 'R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison' from 'R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison_nxt' on a positive edge of the clock, whenever 'R_en' (presumably an enable signal) is high."
