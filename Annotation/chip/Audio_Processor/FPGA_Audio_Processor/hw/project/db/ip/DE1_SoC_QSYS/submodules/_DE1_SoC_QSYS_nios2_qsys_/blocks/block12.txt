Comment: 
The given block of code is responsible for assigning a certain value to a control signal which controls whether the second source operand input should be forced to zero. The new value for the control signal is fetched from another control signal already present. Specifically, the block fetches the current value of `D_ctrl_force_src2_zero` control signal, and assigns it to `R_ctrl_force_src2_zero_nxt` in the next state. This form of assignment is generally used in control and timing signal operation for decision making in a pipeline-based architecture.
