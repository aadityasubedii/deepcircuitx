    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code forms a state machine that counts cycles of a clock signal. After an initial reset condition, which sets the counter to the value '3'b0, the code enters three sequential states, \"st0\", \"st1\", and \"st2\". These states represent the cycle count, and each one increments the cycle count value by '1'. In the final state \"st2\", it will reset the cycles back to '3'b0. Any other condition will bring the circuit back to its initial or default state. This cycle counter is generally used as a delay provider in many designs."
