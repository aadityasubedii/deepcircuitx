This block of code is responsible for controlling exceptions in a register-based design. If a negative edge reset signal is received, the control exception register (R_ctrl_exception) is reset to 0. Otherwise, at the rising edge of the clock cycle - if an enable signal (R_en) is active, the control exception register updates its value from the next state control exception value (R_ctrl_exception_nxt).
