This block of code determines the combined status of a write operation and a debug access. It uses the logical 'AND' operation to assign the output 'write_strobe' when both the 'write' and 'debugaccess' signals are true. This acts as an enable signal that only triggers a write strobe during a debug access, thus ensuring security and control over the write operations.
