This block of code uses an Altera standard synchronizer to synchronize the `monitor_ready` signal with the `tck` clock. The synchronizer gets reset by an active-high `jrst_n` signal. An assign statement relays the `jrst_n` signal to `unxcomplemented_resetxx2`, which is used as asynchronous reset input for the synchronizer. The `monitor_ready` signal is read (`.din`) and output as `monitor_ready_sync`, thus achieving the desired signal synchronization.
