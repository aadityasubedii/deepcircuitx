    "block_comment": "This block manages the \"internal_out_valid\" flag in a cyclic buffer controller. It relies on a clock signal to accurately coordinate operations. At every positive clock edge or reset, the block checks whether a reset signal has been received, and if so, the internal output is deemed invalid. Without a reset, the block calculates the validity through a bitwise operation on \"empty\", \"ok_to_forward\" and \"drop_on_error\". It also includes a condition for the read operation, where the internal_out_valid flag is forced to '0' if the pointers of read and write coincide, which indicates an empty buffer."
