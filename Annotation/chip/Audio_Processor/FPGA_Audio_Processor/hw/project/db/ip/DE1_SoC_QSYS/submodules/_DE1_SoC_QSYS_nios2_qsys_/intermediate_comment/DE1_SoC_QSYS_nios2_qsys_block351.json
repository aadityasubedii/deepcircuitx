    "block_comment": "The block of code manages a synchronous timer decrement operation. This Verilog block utilizes a conditional statement which checks if the 'sync_timer' has reached zero. If it has reached zero, the 'sync_timer' remains at its current value. However, if it has not yet reached zero, it decreases the 'sync_timer' value by one in each clock cycle."
