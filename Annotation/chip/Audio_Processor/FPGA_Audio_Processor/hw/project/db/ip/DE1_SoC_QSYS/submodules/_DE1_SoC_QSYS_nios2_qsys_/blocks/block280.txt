The block of code concerns control flow for a FIFO buffer, specifically the enable control for the 13th slot. If the write pointer (`fifo_wrptr`) is at the 13th location and `input_ge1` is high, or if `ge2_free` is high and the updated write pointer `fifo_wrptr_plus1` points to the 13th position with `input_ge2` high, or if `ge3_free` is high and the doubly updated pointer `fifo_wrptr_plus2` signifies the 13th position with `input_ge3` high, then the 13th slot is enabled.
