    "block_comment": "The given block of code acts as a register that is controlled by a clock signal, a reset signal, and a clock enable signal. On the negative edge of the reset signal, it forces the register 'force_reload' to zero, effectively performing a synchronous reset. When the reset signal is high and the clock edge arrives, if the clock enable signal (clk_en) is asserted, 'force_reload' is updated with the logical OR operation of 'period_h_wr_strobe' and 'period_l_wr_strobe'. This logic allows the 'force_reload' register to change values based on the clock signal if and only if the 'clk_en', 'period_h_wr_strobe', or 'period_l_wr_strobe' signals are high, else it remains in its current state or zero if 'reset_n' goes low."
