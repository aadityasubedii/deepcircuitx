    "block_comment": "This block of code is assigning a signal `D_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br` which signifies an unconditional control transfer instruction (CTI) that is not a branch instruction in a digital design.\nIt achieves this by performing a logical OR operation of various operation signals like `D_op_call`, `D_op_jmpi`, `D_op_eret`, `D_op_bret`, `D_op_rsvx17`, `D_op_rsvx25`, `D_op_ret`, `D_op_jmp`, `D_op_rsvx21`, and `D_op_callr`. Each of these signals corresponds to different types of instructions in the system, for example, `D_op_jmpi` could refer to a jump instruction. The signal `D_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br` gets high whenever any or multiple operation signals are high indicating the corresponding instructions are active.\n"
