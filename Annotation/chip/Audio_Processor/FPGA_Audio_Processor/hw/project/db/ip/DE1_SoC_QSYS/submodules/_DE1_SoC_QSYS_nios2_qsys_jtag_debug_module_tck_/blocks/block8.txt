The given block of Verilog code monitors the state change of the 'tck' signal. When the 'vs_cdr' flag is set, information from various debug and monitor register values is stored in a shift register 'sr' based on the value of 'ir_in'. When 'vs_sdr' is enabled, the size 'DRsize' of the shift register is modified by inserting the 'tdi' at varying positions in the shift register again based on 'DRsize'. When 'vs_uir' flag is set, the 'DRsize' is updated according to 'ir_in' value.
