    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a System-on-Chip design for the DE1-SoC FPGA board, integrating a Nios II processor, SDRAM, on-chip memory, PLL, and various peripherals. It manages data flow between components using an interconnect fabric, handles clock generation and distribution, and provides external interfaces for data I/O, buttons, and SDRAM. The module uses a combination of custom and IP cores to achieve its functionality, with reset control and interrupt mapping for system coordination."
