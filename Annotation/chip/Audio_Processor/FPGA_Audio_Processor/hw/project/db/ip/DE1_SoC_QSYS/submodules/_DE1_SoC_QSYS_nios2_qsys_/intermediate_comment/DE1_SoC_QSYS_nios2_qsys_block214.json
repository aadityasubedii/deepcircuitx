    "block_comment": "The block of code is a resettable register that stores the value of 'D_compare_op'. Upon reset (either through a negative edge of reset_n signal or when reset_n is logically FALSE), the output of the register 'R_compare_op' is set to 0. During each positive clock edge, if there is no reset (reset_n equals to 1), then 'R_compare_op' takes the current value of 'D_compare_op'. This kind of design is often employed in synchronous digital systems to preserve or pass on relevant signal values between clock cycles."
