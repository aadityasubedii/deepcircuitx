    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_wrapper\n\nModule specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_wrapper is a wrapper module primarily utilized for managing the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) debugging system of the \"DE1 SoC QSYS nios2 qsys\" project. This module interfaces with debug triggering conditions via several input ports and outputs signals which command the execution of suitable debug actions. This hardwired interface layer is essential for real-time hardware debugging tasks, facilitating effective interaction with and monitoring of the system state through the JTAG interface. \n\nInput Ports: The module accepts a variety of inputs, most of which are related to debug triggering conditions. These include MonDReg, break_readreg, clk, dbrk_hitX_latch, debugack, monitor_error, monitor_ready, reset_n, resetlatch, tracemem_on, tracemem_trcdata, tracemem_tw, trc_im_addr, trc_on, trc_wrap, trigbrktype, trigger_state_1.\n\nOutput Ports: The debug actions, based on the evaluated conditions, are relayed via the output ports. Notable output ports include jdo, jrst_n, st_ready_test_idle, take_action_break_X, take_no_action_break_X amongst others.\n\nInternal Signals: The module utilizes several internal signals to manage the operation of the JTAG debugging interface. Key signals include vji_cdr, vji_sdr, vji_rti, vji_tck, vji_tdi, vji_tdo, vji_udr, vji_uir, vji_ir_in, and vji_ir_out.\n\nThe Verilog RTL code is principally divided into three sections: Declaration of I/O ports, Internal Wires and Signals, and the Instantiation of sub-modules. In the sub-module instantiation section, the code instantiates two other Verilog modules (DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck and DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_sysclk) which have unique roles in the debug process, indicating a modular design. These sub-modules along with the parent form an integral part of the real-time debugging system of the project.",

It serves as the interface layer between debug signals/conditions and the system's debug actions. The module takes several inputs related to debug triggering conditions and generates outputs that dictate the appropriate debug actions. This module is likely used for real-time hardware debugging tasks during system runtime, allowing for easy interaction with and monitoring of the system state through a JTAG interface."

This module interfaces with debug triggering conditions via several input ports and outputs signals which command the execution of suitable debug actions. This hardwired interface layer is essential for real-time hardware debugging tasks, facilitating effective interaction with and monitoring of the system state through the JTAG interface. \n\nInput Ports: The module accepts a variety of inputs, most of which are related to debug triggering conditions. These include MonDReg, break_readreg, clk, dbrk_hitX_latch, debugack, monitor_error, monitor_ready, reset_n, resetlatch, tracemem_on, tracemem_trcdata, tracemem_tw, trc_im_addr, trc_on, trc_wrap, trigbrktype, trigger_state_1.\n\nOutput Ports: The debug actions, based on the evaluated conditions, are relayed via the output ports. Notable output ports include jdo, jrst_n, st_ready_test_idle, take_action_break_X, take_no_action_break_X amongst others.\n\nInternal Signals: The module utilizes several internal signals to manage the operation of the JTAG debugging interface. Key signals include vji_cdr, vji_sdr, vji_rti, vji_tck, vji_tdi, vji_tdo, vji_udr, vji_uir, vji_ir_in, and vji_ir_out.\n\nThe Verilog RTL code is principally divided into three sections: Declaration of I/O ports, Internal Wires and Signals, and the Instantiation of sub-modules. In the sub-module instantiation section, the code instantiates two other Verilog modules (DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck and DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_sysclk) which have unique roles in the debug process, indicating a modular design. These sub-modules along with the parent form an integral part of the real-time debugging system of the project."

It serves as the interface layer between debug signals/conditions and the system's debug actions. The module takes several inputs related to debug triggering conditions and generates outputs that dictate the appropriate debug actions.

                    "text": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_wrapper\n\nModule specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_wrapper is a wrapper module primarily utilized for managing the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) debugging system of the \"DE1 SoC QSYS nios2 qsys\" project. This module interfaces with debug triggering conditions via several input ports and outputs signals which command the execution of suitable debug actions. This hardwired interface layer is essential for real-time hardware debugging tasks, facilitating effective interaction with and monitoring of the system state through the JTAG interface. \n\nInput Ports: The module accepts a variety of inputs, most of which are related to debug triggering conditions. These include MonDReg, break_readreg, clk, dbrk_hitX_latch, debugack, monitor_error, monitor_ready, reset_n, resetlatch, tracemem_on, tracemem_trcdata, tracemem_tw, trc_im_addr, trc_on, trc_wrap, trigbrktype, trigger_state_1.\n\nOutput Ports: The debug actions, based on the evaluated conditions, are relayed via the output ports. Notable output ports include jdo, jrst_n, st_ready_test_idle, take_action_break_X, take_no_action_break_X amongst others.\n\nInternal Signals: The module utilizes several internal signals to manage the operation of the JTAG debugging interface. Key signals include vji_cdr, vji_sdr, vji_rti, vji_tck, vji_tdi, vji_tdo, vji_udr, vji_uir, vji_ir_in, and vji_ir_out.\n\nThe Verilog RTL code is principally divided into three sections: Declaration of I/O ports, Internal Wires and Signals, and the Instantiation of sub-modules. In the sub-module instantiation section, the code instantiates two other Verilog modules (DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck and DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_sysclk) which have unique roles in the debug process, indicating a modular design. These sub-modules along with the parent form an integral part of the real-time debugging system of the project."
