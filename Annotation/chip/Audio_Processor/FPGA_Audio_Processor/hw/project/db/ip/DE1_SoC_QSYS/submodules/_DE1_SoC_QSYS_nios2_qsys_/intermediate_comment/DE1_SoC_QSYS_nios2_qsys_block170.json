    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential logic block, usually encountered in a digital logic design. In terms of its function, it conditionally assigns a value to the 'd_writedata' on the positive edge of a clock signal or the negative edge of a 'reset_n' signal. The block initializes 'd_writedata' to zero when 'reset_n' signal is active low, essentially providing a reset functionality. If the 'reset_n' is not active, 'd_writedata' gets updated with the value of 'E_st_data' at each positive clock edge, indicating a general data writing operation in the non-reset state."
