The primary functionality is to select 16 bits of input data (in_port) based on the 2-bit address input. The addressed data is then latched onto a 32-bit register (readdata), under the control of a clock (clk) and an active-low reset signal (reset_n). If the reset is active, the readdata is reset to 0. If not, and the clock edge is positive, the selected data with padded zeros is written into the register. This module can be utilized in handling data with various addresses, effectively serving as a multiplexer and memory element."
