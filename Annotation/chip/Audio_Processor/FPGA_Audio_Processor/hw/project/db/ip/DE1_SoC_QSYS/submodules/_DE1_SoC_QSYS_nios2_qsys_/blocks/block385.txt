Comment: 
This line of Verilog code represents a single bit, constant assignment made to a signal named `dbrk2_trigout`. The assigned value is `1'b0`, indicating that this signal is determined to be at a logic low level or `false` condition. This assignment statement ensures that `dbrk2_trigout` remains constantly low throughout the design, overriding any other potential driving value.
