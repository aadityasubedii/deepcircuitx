    "block_comment": "The block of code is assigning a new value to the signal 'F_pcb'. It concatenates 'F_pc' with a 2-bit binary number (00) and assigns the resulting value to 'F_pcb'. In this way, it extends the bit-width of 'F_pc' by 2 bits, padding zeros at the lower end. This might be useful for aligning 'F_pcb' with other signals of a wider bit-width in the design."
