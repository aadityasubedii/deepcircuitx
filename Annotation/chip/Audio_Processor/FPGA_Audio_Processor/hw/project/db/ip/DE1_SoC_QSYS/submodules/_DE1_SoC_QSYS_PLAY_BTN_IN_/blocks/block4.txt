The block assigns a value to `edge_capture_wr_strobe`, based on a specific set of conditions. This happens when three distinct conditions are all met - `chipselect` signal is active, write command is not active marked by `~write_n` and the value of `address` is exactly 3. This assignment is crucial to recording a write strobe on a specific edge capture event.
