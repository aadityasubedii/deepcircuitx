    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for a non-blocking assignment for the 'R_ctrl_shift_rot' register in the next cycle. It assigns the current value of the 'D_ctrl_shift_rot' wire to the 'R_ctrl_shift_rot' register in the next clock cycle. This operation is commonly used in sequential logic such as flip-flops or registers where the assignment of the next state takes place at the positive edge of the clock cycle. It is also a classic RTL coding technique used to transfer data between registers in a synchronous digital system."
