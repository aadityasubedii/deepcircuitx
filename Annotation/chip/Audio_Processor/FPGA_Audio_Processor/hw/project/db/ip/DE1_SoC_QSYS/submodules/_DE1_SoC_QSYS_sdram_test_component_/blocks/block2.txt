Comment: 
This Verilog RTL block assigns a 24-bit hexadecimal value to the variable `txt_code` based on the 3-bit `cmd_code` input. The block's function is a 3-bit to 24-bit map that correlates a `cmd_code` command code to a respective `txt_code` ASCII text code output. The implementation is achieved through a series of conditional ternary operators (? :) that act like a decision tree. The `cmd_code` is evaluated, and depending on its value (ranges from 3'h0 to 3'h7), a unique 24-bit `txt_code` value is assigned. If the `cmd_code` matches none of the listed, it defaults to 24'h424144.
