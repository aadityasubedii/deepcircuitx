This block is a simple part of a Verilog code that updates a variable depending upon the status of the FIFO buffer. It provides a functionality to indicate whether data is available in the FIFO buffer or not. The implementation leverages a flip-flop triggered by the changes in the fifo_EF signal. If the FIFO buffer is not empty (fifo_EF is '0'), the 'dataavailable' flag is set to '1'. Conversely, if the FIFO is empty (fifo_EF is '1'), then 'dataavailable' becomes '0'.
