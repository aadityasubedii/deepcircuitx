    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code checks for the usage of memory blocks and deals with empty latency. Specifically, if memory blocks are in use, indicated by the `USE_MEMORY_BLOCKS` being equal to 1, the code within `gen_blk9` is activated. Similarly, in the case where the `EMPTY_LATENCY` is 1, the code within `gen_blk10` is executed. The conditional checks allow for different implementations depending on system configuration."
