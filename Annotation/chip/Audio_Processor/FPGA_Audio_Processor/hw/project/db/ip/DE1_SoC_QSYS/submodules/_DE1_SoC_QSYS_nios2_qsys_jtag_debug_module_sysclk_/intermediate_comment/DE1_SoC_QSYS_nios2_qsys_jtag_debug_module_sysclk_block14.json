    "block_comment": "The `take_action_ocimem_a` signal is derived from this block of code. It's involved in triggering an action towards an onboard memory opcode interface control operation based on the combination of multiple condition checks. This signal is high (i.e., an action should be taken) when the `enable_action_strobe` signal is high, the instruction register (`ir`) contains the binary value '00', and certain bits (35 and 34) of `jdo` are not set and set respectively. This block essentially implements a combination logic using bitwise AND and NOT operations."
