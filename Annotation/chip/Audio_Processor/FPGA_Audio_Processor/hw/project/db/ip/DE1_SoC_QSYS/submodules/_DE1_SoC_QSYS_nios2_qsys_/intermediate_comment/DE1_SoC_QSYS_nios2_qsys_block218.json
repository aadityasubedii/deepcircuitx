    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for synchronizing the activation signal `R_valid` to the positive edge of the clock `clk` or the negative edge of the `reset_n` signal. In the event of a reset indicated by `reset_n` being 0, `R_valid` will be de-asserted immediately; otherwise, the status of `R_valid` is made equal to `D_valid` in conjunction with positive clock ticks. It achieves this using a common digital hardware design pattern: a flip-flop with synchronous reset and data input."
