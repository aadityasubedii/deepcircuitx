This code block is a sequential logic block that handles signal operations runtime errors related to incoming packets. The operation of the block is governed by a main clock or a reset signal. When a reset signal is received, it initializes the SOP (Start of Packet) pointer and flags off any packet errors. Otherwise, on each clock positive edge, the action taken depends on the signals received with the incoming packet: If a 'start' signal is received, the write (wr_ptr) location is noted as the start of packet. If an 'end' signal is 'in_pkt_eop_arrive' is received, it marks the packet as error-free. If an 'in_pkt_error' signal is received with or after the start of packet, it flags the packet as erroneous.
