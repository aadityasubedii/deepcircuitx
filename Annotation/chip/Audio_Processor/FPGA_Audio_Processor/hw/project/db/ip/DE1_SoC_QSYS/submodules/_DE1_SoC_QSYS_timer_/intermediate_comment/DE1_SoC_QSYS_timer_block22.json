    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the concatenation of the values of the 'period_h_register' and 'period_l_register' to the 'counter_load_value.' This is a commonly used Verilog coding technique for combining two or more registers into a single bit-vector, allowing for more efficient processing or manipulation of data. The operation happens continuously, every time when either of the period_h_register or period_l_register values changes."
