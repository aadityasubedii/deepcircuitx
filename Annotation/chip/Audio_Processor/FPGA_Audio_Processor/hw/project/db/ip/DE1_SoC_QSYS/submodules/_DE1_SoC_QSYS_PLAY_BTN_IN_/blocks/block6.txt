Comment: 
This block of code specifies the behavior of an interrupt request (irq) mask in a synchronous digital system. Based on the status of the system reset (`reset_n`) signal and the chip selection (`chipselect`), write enable (`write_n`), and address signals, it modifies the `irq_mask`. When there is a negative edge on the `reset_n`, i.e., when the system is going through a reset, the `irq_mask` is set to 0. Otherwise, when the chip is selected and write is enabled (signified by a 0 on `write_n` since it is active low) and the address equals 2, the `irq_mask` is updated with the `writedata` value on the clock's (`clk`) positive edge.
