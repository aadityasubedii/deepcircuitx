    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for initializing a variable called `dct_is_taken`. The implementation detail is straightforward; it's using the `assign` keyword, which signifies continuous assignment in Verilog, to set the value of the `dct_is_taken` variable. Specifically, it sets `dct_is_taken` to `1'b0`, which is the binary representation of the number 0. Hence, at any moment, regardless of the state of the system, the value of `dct_is_taken` is always 0."
