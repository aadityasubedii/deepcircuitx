    "block_comment": "The block assigns a value to the wire `D_ctrl_rot_right`, taking a logical OR of the four wires `D_op_rsvx10`, `D_op_ror`, `D_op_rsvx42`, `D_op_rsvx43`. This operation indicates whether a specific control operation, possibly a rotate-right operation signaled by `D_ctrl_rot_right`, is triggered by any of the four input signals."
