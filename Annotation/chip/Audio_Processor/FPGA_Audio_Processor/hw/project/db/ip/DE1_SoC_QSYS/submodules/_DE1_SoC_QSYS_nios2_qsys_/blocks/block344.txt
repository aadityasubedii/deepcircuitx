The block assigns a value to the signal "trc_on", which is essentially controlling the trace activation. The trace is activated by performing a bitwise AND operation between the second bit of the "trc_ctrl" array and the logical OR operation of the tenth bit of the same array and the "not_in_debug_mode" signal, suggesting when the trace can be turned on based on certain control configurations and when the system is not in debug mode.
