    "block_comment": "The initial block of code is responsible for reading the content of a .dat file into a memory array at the start of the simulation. It makes use of the Verilog system function `$readmemh`, which reads hex data from the specified .dat file (\"DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component.dat\") and fills the `mem_array` with the read content. This system function uses the address of the data object (in this case `mem_array`) as the starting address to fill the data."
