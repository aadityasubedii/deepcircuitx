Comment: 
This line of Verilog code defines the value of the `CODE` wire. The bitwise AND operator ('&') and the conditional (ternary) operator ('?') are used to determine the `CODE` value based on the condition `&(cmd_all|4'h7)` (bitwise AND between each bit of result of bitwise OR operation on `cmd_all` and hexadecimal '7'). If this expression calculates to true/non-zero, then `CODE` gets the value of `24'h494e48` (a constant hexadecimal value), otherwise `CODE` gets the value of `txt_code`.
