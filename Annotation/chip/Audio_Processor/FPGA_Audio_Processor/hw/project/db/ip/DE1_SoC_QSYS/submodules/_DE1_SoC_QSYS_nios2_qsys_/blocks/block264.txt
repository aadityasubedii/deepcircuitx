Comment: 
This block of code acts as a synchronous reset mechanism and data transfer module which is clocked by a double-frequency clock signal (clkx2), having a reset signal (jrst_n). When the reset signal is active low, it resets all the three registers namely, x2, tr_clk_reg and tr_data_reg to 0. In non-reset state, it transfers data from x1 to x2, inverts the phase signal to tr_clk_reg, and selectively assigns the 18 bit segment of tw based on the phase value to tr_data_reg.
