    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable Avalon streaming FIFO with options for depth, width, and packet handling. It uses a memory array for data storage, manages read/write pointers, and includes logic for fill level tracking, almost full/empty signaling, and error handling. The module supports store-and-forward or cut-through modes, and provides a CSR interface for configuration and status reporting. It handles data flow control, packet boundaries, and optional features like dropping packets on error."
