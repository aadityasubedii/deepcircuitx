    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns hexadecimal values to the D_inst variable based on the specific operation selected. The operations are selected through boolean variables (D_op_*). Each operation is represented as a 56-bit hexadecimal constant corresponding to a unique assembly instruction. If one of the operation variables (D_op_*) evaluates as true, the corresponding hexadecimal value is assigned to D_inst. If none of the operation variables are true, D_inst is assigned the hexadecimal value for 'BAD'. This block functions as a lookup table for operations within the design and can be part of a hardware implementation of an instruction set architecture."
