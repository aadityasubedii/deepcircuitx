    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `d_write` to `cpu_d_write`. Though a straightforward operation, the significance lies in redirecting or mirroring the control signal `d_write` to `cpu_d_write`. Doing so allows for the state of `d_write` to be tracked or used under the alias `cpu_d_write`, which might be more convenient or appropriate in certain contexts or areas of the code."
