    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous system with active low reset and positive edge clock trigger for controlling the variable `R_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16`. If the reset signal `reset_n` is activated (falling edge, value 0), the variable `R_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16` is reset to zero. On the other hand, if the reset signal is not activated and the enable signal `R_en` is high at the positive edge of the clock, the variable `R_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16` gets updated with the value of `R_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16_nxt`."
