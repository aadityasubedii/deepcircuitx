Module-level comment: This is the 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_PLAY_BTN_IN' module that serves as a button interface in hardware input. It operates using memory-mapped I/O for read/write with dedicated address routes, synchronized with a system clock. Module inputs include data, control signals (including write, reset, and clock), and chipselect for activation. The outputs are 'irq' for interrupt requests and 'readdata' for data reading operations. Internally, it uses signals for data handling, edge detection, interrupt masking, and edge capturing, which are conditionally manipulated in their dedicated controller blocks to manage the overall functionality.
