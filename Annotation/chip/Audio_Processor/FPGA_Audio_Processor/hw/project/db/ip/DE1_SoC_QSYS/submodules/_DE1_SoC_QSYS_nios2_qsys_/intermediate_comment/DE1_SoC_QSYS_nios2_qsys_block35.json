    "block_comment": "This block of code handles reset and load control logic for a non-IO part of a system. In Verilog, the block listens for a positive edge of clock signal or negative edge of the reset signal. If the reset signal is active (low), it resets the 'R_ctrl_ld_non_io' register to 0. Alternatively, if the reset signal is not active and 'R_en' is high, the present state of 'R_ctrl_ld_non_io' is updated to its next state, signified by 'R_ctrl_ld_non_io_nxt'."
