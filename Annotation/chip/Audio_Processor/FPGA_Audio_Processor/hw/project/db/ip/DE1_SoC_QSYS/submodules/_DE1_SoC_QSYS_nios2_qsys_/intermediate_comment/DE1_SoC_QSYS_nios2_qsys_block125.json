    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to assign a value to the `W_estatus_reg_inst_nxt` signal. It uses a logic chain of conditional (ternary) operators to decide the signal value. If the `R_ctrl_crst` is TRUE, it immediately assigns '0' to `W_estatus_reg_inst_nxt`. If not but `R_ctrl_exception` is TRUE, the value of `W_status_reg` is assigned. If both of these are FALSE, but `E_wrctl_estatus` is TRUE, then the first element of `E_src1` is assigned. If all three conditions are FALSE, it retains the current value of `W_estatus_reg_inst_nxt`."
