    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for node activitation on positive edge clock or negative edge reset. When the reset_n is zero, it doesn't execute any operation, hence the empty block. However, when i_read holds, the code checks if there's an \"unknown\" (or \"don't-care\") value in the i_address. If such a situation arises, it raises an error message, indicating the i_address being 'x', and then stops execution."
