    "block_comment": "This block is a state machine that handles the fill level of a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer. It updates the 'fifo_fill_level' based on the state of the system, which is dictated by the clock, reset, drop_on_error, read, and write signals. When a system reset is triggered, it clears the FIFO fill level. If an error occurs and the 'drop_on_error' flag is set, it reduces the FIFO fill level by the length of the current packet minus one, and an extra 1 if a read operation is performed. If there is a write operation without a read, it increments the FIFO fill level by one. Finally, if there is a read operation without a write, it decrements the FIFO fill level by one."
