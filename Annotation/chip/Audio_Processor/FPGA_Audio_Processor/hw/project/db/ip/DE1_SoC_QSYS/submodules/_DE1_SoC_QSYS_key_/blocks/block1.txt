Comment: 
This code block carries out the function of a falling edge detector in digital circuitry. By implementing a bitwise AND operation between the inverted 'd1_data_in' signal and the regular 'd2_data_in' signal, the code block only outputs a 'high' signal when a transition from high to low occurs (i.e., a falling edge is detected) in the input data signals.
