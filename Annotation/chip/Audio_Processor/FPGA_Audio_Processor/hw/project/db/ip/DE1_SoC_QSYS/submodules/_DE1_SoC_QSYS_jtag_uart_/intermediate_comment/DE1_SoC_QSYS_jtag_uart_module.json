    "module": "Module level comment: \n\nThe DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart is a module designed for JTAG UART interactions, implemented through integrated FIFO buffers. It manages read and write operations, represented by av_read_n, av_write_n, av_writedata and av_readdata, determined by av_chipselect, av_waitrequest signals. The status of FIFO buffers are maintained through internal signals like fifo_AE, fifo_AF, and woverflow. Integrated modules, DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_scfifo_w and DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_scfifo_r, manage write and read operations respectively. It furthermore handles interrupts, and controls timing and activity status with additional internal signals."
