This block is responsible for managing the read control signal during a new instruction load (`R_ctrl_ld & E_new_inst`) or while the system is awaiting a data request (`d_read & d_waitrequest`). It employs bitwise OR operation to assign the next state of the 'd_read_nxt' signal. It ultimately ensures that the read is initiated under two conditions: 1) During the loading of a new instruction with control load enabled; or 2) When there's an ongoing read operation and the system is waiting for a data request.
