    "block_comment": "This block of code is a reset and memory update routine for a first in first out (FIFO) buffer. It updates a memory utilization flag based on read and write operations and also provides for reset functionality. On either a rising clock edge or a reset, the block checks if a reset has been issued and if so, it clears the memory utilized flag. If not a reset event, it'll then check for either read or write operations. A write operation sets the memory utilized flag. On a read operation, if there's a buffer depth larger than 1, it cascades the next memory flag to the current position, else it simply clears the flag indicating memory utilization."
