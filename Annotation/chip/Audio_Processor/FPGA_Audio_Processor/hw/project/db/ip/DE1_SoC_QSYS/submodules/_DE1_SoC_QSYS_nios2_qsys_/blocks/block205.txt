Comment: 
This block of code operates as a synchronous reset circuitry. The system is reset when `reset_n` is asserted low. Whenever a positive edge of `clk` or a negative edge of `reset_n` is detected, the always block is triggered. If `reset_n` is low indicating an active reset event, `E_new_inst` is set to 0, otherwise, it is assigned the value of `R_valid`. This can serve to clear flags or ensure valid data at start of the system.
