Comment: 
This block of code assigns a wire `d_address` with `W_mem_baddr`. It essentially copies the binary address value present at `W_mem_baddr` onto `d_address`. It implies that the variable `W_mem_baddr` is being used as the base address for memory and is now being passed to `d_address` that may further be used in the memory addressing.
