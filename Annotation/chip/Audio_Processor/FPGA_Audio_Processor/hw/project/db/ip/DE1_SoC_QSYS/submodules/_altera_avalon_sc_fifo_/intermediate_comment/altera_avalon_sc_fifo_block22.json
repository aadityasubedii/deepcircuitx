    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is involved in packet length processing for certain conditions. If the `USE_FILL_LEVEL` flag is turned on, a 32-bit wire `depth32` is created and assigned the value of `DEPTH`. Within the first condition, an additional check is done for the `USE_STORE_FORWARD` flag. If this is also enabled, a register `curr_packet_len_less_one` with a bit-width of `ADDR_WIDTH + 1` is instantiated. This block is likely part of a larger system that utilizes conditional compilation to suit different packet processing scenarios. The presence of these flags indicates configurability in the design, allowing for efficient resource allocation based on the exact requirements."
