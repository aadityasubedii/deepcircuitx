Module-level comment: This DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2 module implements an on-chip memory system for the DE1 SoC platform. The module operates the memory using input control signals and address/data ports, outputting the read data. Internally, the module uses these signals to control the 'altsyncram' primitive for handling the memory operations. The 'address', 'byteenable', 'clk', 'wren' signals control and synchronize the respective memory operation. The 'readdata' signal to carry the data read from the memory. The output port provides this read data, ensuring a complete memory operation execution.
