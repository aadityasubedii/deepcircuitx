    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a debugging tool to halt simulation in case there has been an instantiation error for a generated module. If execution reaches this block, a display message indicating the fault (\"Generated module instantiated with wrong parameters\") will be executed, followed by a '$stop' which serves to interrupt the simulation altogether."
