    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns the value of the `rdaddress` signal to the `read_address` signal. It does this through the use of an `always` block that is sensitive to any change in the value of the `rdaddress` signal. Once `rdaddress` changes, the right-hand side (`rdaddress`) is evaluated and then assigned to the left-hand side (`read_address`)."
