    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_key. \n\nModule specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key module is an interface part of an interrupt-driven hardware design, operating as an external interrupt controller. The primary purpose of this module is to monitor inputs from a button or another interrupt source (denoted as \"in_port\"), perform edge detection on these inputs, emit an interrupt (\"irq\") when a change in input has been detected and not yet cleared, and to communicate with a CPU or an external device via address and data buses.\n\nThe module has seven input ports: \"address\" used for accessing different functionalities; \"chipselect\" for module selection; \"clk\" for timing synchronization; \"in_port\" for data inputs (such as from buttons or interrupts); \"reset_n\", an active low reset signal; \"write_n\", an active low write signal indicating a write operation; \"writedata\" which is the data to be written to the module. For output, the module provides \"irq\", an interrupt request output, and \"readdata\", the data read from the module.\n\nInternally, the module uses several signals to perform its operations. The signals \"clk_en\" (clock enable), \"d1_data_in\", \"d2_data_in\" work for edge detection by comparing present and past states of input data. Signal \"data_in\" is the default input data. Signal \"edge_capture\" captures if an edge has been detected. The signal \"edge_capture_wr_strobe\" clears the 'edge_capture'. The \"edge_detect\" signal represents the outcome of edge detection. Signal \"irq_mask\" functions to control which interrupts can propagate externally. \"read_mux_out\" is the output from a multiplexer, selecting various pieces of information to put out based on 'address'. The \"readdata\" signal sends out read data from the module to external CPU.\n\nWithin the defined module, different sections of the code handle distinct portions of the module functionality. They manage the timing synchronizations; write and read operations to the hardware; detection of edge and mask of the interrupt; resetting the internal state of the module for different signals such as clock, reset, chipselect, and write active-low signal during a button press/release or an interrupt.",

It monitors input from a button or interrupt source (input \"in_port\"), performs edge detection on the input, and sets an interrupt (\"irq\") when an edge (button press/release or interrupt) is detected and not yet cleared (via \"edge_capture\"). It communicates with an external device or CPU via address and data buses (\"address\" and \"readdata/writedata\"). Control signals for the communication include \"clk\" (clock), \"reset_n\" (active-low reset), \"chipselect\" (to select this module among possibly others), and \"write_n\" (active-low write signal). The \"irq_mask\" determines whether an interrupt request will be issued when the specific edge (button press/release) is detected. This module is likely a part of a larger design, implemented on an FPGA. Its main purpose is to handle interrupt inputs/outputs and perform necessary operations according to the input, including edge detection and interrupt mask."

If set to 0, it resets the relevant internal state of the module.\n6. write_n: This is an active low write signal. If set to 0, it indicates a write operation to this hardware.\n7. writedata: This is the data which is to be written to this hardware.\n\nOutput ports:\n\n1. irq: This is the interrupt request output. It is set if the interrupt request needs to be made to the external device or the CPU.\n2. readdata: This is the output data port. This is the data that is read from the hardware/module and sent to the external device or the CPU.\n\nExplanation: These input and output ports together allow this module to be used as an external interrupt controller for detecting certain edge cases as defined by `in_port` and setting an interrupt (as denoted by `irq`).

In this module, it has been permanently set to 1.\n\n2. d1_data_in, d2_data_in: These signals are registered versions of 'data_in' delayed by one and two clock cycles, respectively. They support edge detection by letting the design compare present and past states of 'data_in'.\n\n3. data_in: Default input data (possibly from buttons or interrupts) is received here.\n\n4. edge_capture: This register captures if an edge has been detected. It is cleared when the edge_capture_wr_strobe signal is high.\n\n5. edge_capture_wr_strobe: A combination of control signals that signifies when 'edge_capture' should be cleared (when a write operation is performed at address 3).\n\n6. edge_detect: It represents the result of edge detection. An edge is detected when there is a transition (0->1) in 'data_in' ('~d1_data_in & d2_data_in').\n\n7. irq_mask: This register stores the interrupt mask value, which is written by the external device (CPU). The mask determines which interrupts are allowed to propagate externally.\n\n8. read_mux_out: This is the output from a multiplexer. Depending on the value of the 'address', various information (data_in, irq_mask, edge_capture) is selected to be put on 'read_mux_out'.\n\n9. readdata: The read data from the module. It would be assigned the value of 'read_mux_out' during a clock cycle. If a reset signal is received, this is set to 0. Its value would be used as output when the PC reads from this hardware.\n   \nAll internal signals complement each other to perform necessary operations according to the input state such as edge detection and interrupt masking.

The primary purpose of this module is to monitor inputs from a button or another interrupt source (denoted as \"in_port\"), perform edge detection on these inputs, emit an interrupt (\"irq\") when a change in input has been detected and not yet cleared, and to communicate with a CPU or an external device via address and data buses.\n\nThe module has seven input ports: \"address\" used for accessing different functionalities; \"chipselect\" for module selection; \"clk\" for timing synchronization; \"in_port\" for data inputs (such as from buttons or interrupts); \"reset_n\", an active low reset signal; \"write_n\", an active low write signal indicating a write operation; \"writedata\" which is the data to be written to the module. For output, the module provides \"irq\", an interrupt request output, and \"readdata\", the data read from the module.\n\nInternally, the module uses several signals to perform its operations. The signals \"clk_en\" (clock enable), \"d1_data_in\", \"d2_data_in\" work for edge detection by comparing present and past states of input data. Signal \"data_in\" is the default input data. Signal \"edge_capture\" captures if an edge has been detected. The signal \"edge_capture_wr_strobe\" clears the 'edge_capture'. The \"edge_detect\" signal represents the outcome of edge detection. Signal \"irq_mask\" functions to control which interrupts can propagate externally. \"read_mux_out\" is the output from a multiplexer, selecting various pieces of information to put out based on 'address'. The \"readdata\" signal sends out read data from the module to external CPU.\n\nWithin the defined module, different sections of the code handle distinct portions of the module functionality. They manage the timing synchronizations; write and read operations to the hardware; detection of edge and mask of the interrupt; resetting the internal state of the module for different signals such as clock, reset, chipselect, and write active-low signal during a button press/release or an interrupt."
