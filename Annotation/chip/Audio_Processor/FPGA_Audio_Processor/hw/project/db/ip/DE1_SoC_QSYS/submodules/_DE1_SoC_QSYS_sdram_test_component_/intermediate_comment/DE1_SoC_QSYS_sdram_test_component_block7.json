    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily serves a reporting role in the testbench setup. This specific Verilog code block writes a series of statements to the console as part of a testbench for the 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component'. These statements convey that the testbench includes an SOPC Builder Generated Altera model, used to simulate accesses to SDRAM. Furthermore, it details that the initial contents for this simulation are sourced from the file 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component.dat'. The messages are enclosed within a set of asterisks for clear visibility. It achieves this function using the '$write' system function to print statements during the initial evaluation phase of the testbench."
