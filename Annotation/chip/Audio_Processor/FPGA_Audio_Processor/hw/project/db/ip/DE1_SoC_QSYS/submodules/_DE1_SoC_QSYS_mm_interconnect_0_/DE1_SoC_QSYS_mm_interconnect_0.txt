Module-level comment: This module implements an interconnect for a SoC design, managing communication between NIOS II processor, memory interfaces, and peripherals. It uses Avalon interfaces, routers, and multiplexers to handle address decoding, data width adaptation, and arbitration between multiple masters and slaves. The module includes burst adapters, command/response demultiplexers, and width adapters to ensure proper data transfer between components with different interface specifications.
