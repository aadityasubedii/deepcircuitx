    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the assignment of a new value to the `writedata` register. It operates under the control of rising clock edge or a falling edge signal 'jrst_n'. If the 'jrst_n' signal is at low level, it resets the 'writedata' to 0, providing an asynchronous reset functionality. Otherwise, on every rising edge of clock the 'writedata' takes on the next value 'writedata_nxt', thus, allowing for data update under normal operation."
