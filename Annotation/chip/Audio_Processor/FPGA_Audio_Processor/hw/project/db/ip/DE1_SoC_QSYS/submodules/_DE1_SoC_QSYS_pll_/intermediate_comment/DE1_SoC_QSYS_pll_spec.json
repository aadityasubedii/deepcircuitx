    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll module is a programmable logical module on an Altera SoC system that represents a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL). The PLL takes a reference clock signal (refclk) and a reset signal (rst) and produces two output clock signals (outclk_0 and outclk_1), while also emitting a 'locked' signal indicating the lock status of the PLL. The functionality of the DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll is carried out by instantiating an Altera-provided PLL module called altera_pll with specific configuration parameters. These parameters set features such as the number of clocks, output clock frequencies, phase shift, duty cycle, and more. \n\nThere are two inputs to this module - 'refclk', the reference clock for the PLL, and 'rst', the reset signal for the PLL. The output signals are 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1', which represent the two clock signals generated by the PLL, and 'locked', indicating the lock status of the PLL. \n\nInternally, the module does not explicitly declare any internal signals. However, implicitly, signals such as 'rst', '{outclk_1, outclk_0}', 'locked', and 'refclk' within the altera_pll sub-module instantiation link the sub-module to the main module. \n\nThe code essentially consists of one major block - the instantiation of the altera_pll sub-module. The block uses the input reference clock to generate two output clocks with specified frequencies and phase shifts, and it adjusts its internal VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) to maintain these output frequencies in lock with the input reference clock frequency.",
