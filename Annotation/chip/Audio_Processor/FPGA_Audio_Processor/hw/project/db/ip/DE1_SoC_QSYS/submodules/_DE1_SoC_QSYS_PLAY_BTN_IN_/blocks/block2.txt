This block of code implements a dual-stage pipeline with reset functionality. At each positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the asynchronous reset signal, the block checks if the reset is active. If it is, the pipeline registers `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` are set to zero, and the reset operation is prioritized. If the reset isn't active and clock enable (`clk_en`) is high, `d1_data_in` captures the input data, and `d2_data_in` captures the output of the first stage on each clock cycle, allowing data to move through the two-stage pipeline.
