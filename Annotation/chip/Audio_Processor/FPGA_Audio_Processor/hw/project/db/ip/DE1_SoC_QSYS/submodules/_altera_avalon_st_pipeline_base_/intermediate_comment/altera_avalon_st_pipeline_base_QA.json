The two stages \"REGISTERED_READY_PLINE\" and \"UNREGISTERED_READY_PLINE\" seem to refer to stages in the pipeline and the flow of data appears to be controlled by ready-valid handshaking signals. Conditions like whether the pipeline is 'full' or 'not full' and the valid input and output signals are used to control the flow of data. The DATA_WIDTH is defined as the product of the parameters SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT and BITS_PER_SYMBOL which might be used to accommodate different data types/sizes. Depending on PIPELINE_READY parameter, the pipeline operates in either a registered or unregistered mode. In the unregistered mode, input readiness is simply determined by the output readiness or if the pipeline is not full."
