    "module": "Module-level comment: The module DE1_SoC_QSYS_sysid_qsys serves a system identification role within a SoC. It uses 'address' as an input to conditionally assign an output 'readdata'. When 'address' is high, 'readdata' is assigned the value 1494430760, while a low 'address' values yield zero. 'clock' and 'reset_n' inputs are present but currently unused. The single block of code implements the conditional assignment operation for 'readdata'.\n"
