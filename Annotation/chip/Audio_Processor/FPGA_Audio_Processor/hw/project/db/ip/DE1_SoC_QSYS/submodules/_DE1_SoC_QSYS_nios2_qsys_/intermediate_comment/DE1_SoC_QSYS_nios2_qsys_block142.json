    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a synchronous reset logic for a status register. Upon a rising edge of the clock signal or a falling edge of the reset_n signal, it triggers an update to the W_status_reg_pie register. If the reset_n signal is low, it indicates a reset and the code sets the status register W_status_reg_pie to zero. If the reset_n signal is not low, the status register gets the value of the next state (W_status_reg_pie_nxt), effectively making it a flip-flop that's updated every clock cycle when not in reset."
