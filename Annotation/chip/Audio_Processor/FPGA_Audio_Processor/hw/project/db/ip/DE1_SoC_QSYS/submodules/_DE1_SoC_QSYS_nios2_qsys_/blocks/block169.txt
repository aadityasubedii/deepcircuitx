This block of code serves as a synchronous reset logic for the variable 'd_byteenable'. The operation depends on the positive edge of the 'clk' clock signal or the negative edge of the 'reset_n' reset signal. When 'reset_n' equals to 0 (indicating a reset state), 'd_byteenable' is reset to 0. Conversely, if there is a positive edge in 'clk' while 'reset_n' stays high, 'd_byteenable' is assigned with the value of 'E_mem_byte_en'.
