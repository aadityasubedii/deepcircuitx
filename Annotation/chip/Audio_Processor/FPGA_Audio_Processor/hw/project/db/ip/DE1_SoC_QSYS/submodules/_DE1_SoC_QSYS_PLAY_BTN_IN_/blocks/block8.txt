Comment: 
This block of code is primarily serving as a synchronous reset for the 'readdata' variable. It triggers at the rising edge of the clock signal or at the falling edge of the reset signal. When the 'reset_n' signal becomes inactive (low), 'readdata' gets reset to zero immediately. Otherwise, if the clock enable signal 'clk_en' is active (high), 'readdata' captures and holds the value from the 'read_mux_out' signal at the rising edge of clock signal.
