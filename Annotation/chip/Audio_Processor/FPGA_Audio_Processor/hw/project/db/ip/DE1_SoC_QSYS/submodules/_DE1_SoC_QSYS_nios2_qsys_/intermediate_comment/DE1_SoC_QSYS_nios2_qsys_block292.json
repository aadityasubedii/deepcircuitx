    "block_comment": "The block enables the 9th FIFO memory unit based on specific input conditions. It enables the FIFO if the write pointer is pointing to the 9th location and there exist an input greater or equal to 1 (`input_ge1`), or if ge2_free is true (indicating second generator is free for data), write pointer is pointing to the 8th location and an input greater or equal to 2 (`input_ge2`) exists. Similarly, this also pertains to the ge3 signal if input greater or equal to 3 (`input_ge3`) exists and the write pointer points to the 7th location."
