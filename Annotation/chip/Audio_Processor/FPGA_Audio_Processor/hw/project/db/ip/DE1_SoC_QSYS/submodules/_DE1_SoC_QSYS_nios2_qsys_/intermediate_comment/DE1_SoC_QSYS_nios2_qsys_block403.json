    "block_comment": "This block is a flip-flop designed to control a debug break signal. When a negative reset signal (`reset_n == 0`) is encountered at either a positive clock edge (`posedge clk`) or a negative reset edge (`negedge reset_n`), the debug break signal (`dbrk_break`) is reset to 0. Otherwise, `dbrk_break` is either inverted, when `dbrk_break` is true, by a ~debugack signal or maintains its state through `dbrk_break_pulse`."
