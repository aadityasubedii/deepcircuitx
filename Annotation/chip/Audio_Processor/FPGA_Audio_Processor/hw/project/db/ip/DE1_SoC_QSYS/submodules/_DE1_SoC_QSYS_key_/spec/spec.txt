Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_key. 

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key module is an interface part of an interrupt-driven hardware design, operating as an external interrupt controller. The primary purpose of this module is to monitor inputs from a button or another interrupt source (denoted as "in_port"), perform edge detection on these inputs, emit an interrupt ("irq") when a change in input has been detected and not yet cleared, and to communicate with a CPU or an external device via address and data buses.

The module has seven input ports: "address" used for accessing different functionalities; "chipselect" for module selection; "clk" for timing synchronization; "in_port" for data inputs (such as from buttons or interrupts); "reset_n", an active low reset signal; "write_n", an active low write signal indicating a write operation; "writedata" which is the data to be written to the module. For output, the module provides "irq", an interrupt request output, and "readdata", the data read from the module.

Internally, the module uses several signals to perform its operations. The signals "clk_en" (clock enable), "d1_data_in", "d2_data_in" work for edge detection by comparing present and past states of input data. Signal "data_in" is the default input data. Signal "edge_capture" captures if an edge has been detected. The signal "edge_capture_wr_strobe" clears the 'edge_capture'. The "edge_detect" signal represents the outcome of edge detection. Signal "irq_mask" functions to control which interrupts can propagate externally. "read_mux_out" is the output from a multiplexer, selecting various pieces of information to put out based on 'address'. The "readdata" signal sends out read data from the module to external CPU.

Within the defined module, different sections of the code handle distinct portions of the module functionality. They manage the timing synchronizations; write and read operations to the hardware; detection of edge and mask of the interrupt; resetting the internal state of the module for different signals such as clock, reset, chipselect, and write active-low signal during a button press/release or an interrupt.
