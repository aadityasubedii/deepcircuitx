    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the readiness state of the buffer or queue. It employs a high-level logic symbol, '!', to determine whether the storage element is full or not. If the buffer is not full (full=0), then the readiness signal (in_ready) is activated (in_ready=1) indicating that the storage element can accept more data; else if the buffer is full (full=1), the readiness signal is not activated (in_ready=0) portraying that the storage element cannot accept any more data given its capacity has been reached."
