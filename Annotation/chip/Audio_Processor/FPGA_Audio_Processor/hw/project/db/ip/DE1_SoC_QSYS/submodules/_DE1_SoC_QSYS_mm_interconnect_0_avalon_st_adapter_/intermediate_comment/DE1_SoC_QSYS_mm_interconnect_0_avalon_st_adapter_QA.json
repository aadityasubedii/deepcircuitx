One of its tasks is to check the parameters used when instantiating it; it verifies that the parameters adhere to the expected values and sends an error message (\"Generated module instantiated with wrong parameters\") if there is a discrepancy. The parameters checked include data width, channel width, error width, use of valid and ready signals, use of empty port, and latency.
