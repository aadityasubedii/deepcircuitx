    "block_comment": "This conditional 'generate if' block in Verilog checks for the ASYNC_RESET flag. If ASYNC_RESET is true, it initiates the logic inside the 'begin' and 'end' block. The 'generate' keyword is used to conditionally instantiate hardware within Verilog designs, and it's often used when different configurations or architectures need to be easily swapped in/out based on certain parameters. Here, the block is being used for asynchronous reset behavior in the design. Implementation and logic inside the 'begin' and 'end' is not shown in provided code snippet."
