    "block_comment": "This block of code deals with the assignment of the next state variable for the write control instance in a register. The value of the register `R_ctrl_wrctl_inst_nxt` is being assigned the value of the wire `D_ctrl_wrctl_inst`, meaning that the next state of the write control register is determined by the current state of `D_ctrl_wrctl_inst`. This is an example of typical register transfer level (RTL) design where registers are being updated based on the values of different wires, implementing sequential logic."
