This block is tasked with assigning a hexadecimal code to `txt_code` based on the value of `cmd_code`. It uses a conditional (ternary) operator to carry out comparisons with `cmd_code` for a range of constant values from `3'h0` to `3'h7`, each time assigning a different hexadecimal constant to `txt_code` if the comparison is true. If none of the comparisons are met, it defaults to assigning `24'h424144` to `txt_code`.
