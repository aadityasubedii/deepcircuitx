The block of code is responsible for the asynchronous reset and synchronous set of the 'readdata' register. In the event of a negative edge reset, the 'readdata' register is reset to 0. Otherwise, under a positive edge clock and when the clock enable signal (clk_en) is high, 'readdata' is assigned the output of 'read_mux_out' with zero extended to 32 bits.
