    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a synchronous hardware construct which is either reset or sets the variable `E_xbrk_traceoff` based on certain conditions. The synchronicity is determined by the positive edge of the clock signal `clk` or the negative edge of the reset signal `reset_n`. Specifically, the block sets `E_xbrk_traceoff` to 0 if `reset_n` is 0, implementing an active-low synchronous reset. Alternatively, if the enable signal `E_cpu_addr_en` is high, the block sets `E_xbrk_traceoff` to the value of `xbrk_toff_hit`, allowing for the conditionally controlled data transfer."
