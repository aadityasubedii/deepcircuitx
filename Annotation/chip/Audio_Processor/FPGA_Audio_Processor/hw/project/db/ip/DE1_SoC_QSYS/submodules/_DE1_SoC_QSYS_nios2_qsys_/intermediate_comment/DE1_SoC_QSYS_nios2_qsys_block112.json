    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to define a constant signal of value '0' in Verilog hardware design. Specifically, it assigns a binary value of zero (\"1'b0\") to the signal 'D_ctrl_custom_multi'. As an 'assign' statement, this operation continuously drives the designated signal with the specified value, functioning as a wire that always carries a 'low' (zero) digital state."
