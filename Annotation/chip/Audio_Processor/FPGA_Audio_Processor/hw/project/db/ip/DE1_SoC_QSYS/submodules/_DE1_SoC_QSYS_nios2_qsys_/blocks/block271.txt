Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for checking if any bit in the 'input_tm_cnt' is set, essentially checking if 'input_tm_cnt' is greater than or equal to 1. The operation is performed using the reduction-OR operation (|), a bitwise operation that ORs all the bits of 'input_tm_cnt' together. If the result is '1', 'input_ge1' is set, indicating that 'input_tm_cnt' is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise, 'input_ge1' is cleared (set to 0).
