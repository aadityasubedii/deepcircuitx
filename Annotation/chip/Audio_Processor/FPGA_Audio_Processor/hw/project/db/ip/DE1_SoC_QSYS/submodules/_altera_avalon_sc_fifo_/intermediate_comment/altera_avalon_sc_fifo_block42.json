    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a conditional statement that becomes active when the value of the variable \"DEPTH\" exceeds 1. It includes a generate construct (encoded by \": gen_blk12\") to dynamically create one or more hardware blocks with a similar structure, based on run-time conditions. The use of the \"begin\" keyword suggests the creation of an unnamed scope which will contain statements applicable to this condition. However, without the rest of the RTL script, the specifics of what this block generates is undeterminable based on just this line. The label \"gen_blk12\" indicates that multiple instances of the following code blocks may be generated each with a unique identifier."
