The block of code is primarily setting up a condition for the next state of hbreak_pending, which is defined by hbreak_pending_nxt. The hbreak_pending_nxt takes its value based on the status of two others: hbreak_pending and hbreak_req. If hbreak_pending is true, then hbreak_pending_nxt takes the value of hbreak_enabled. But if hbreak_pending is not true or false, then hbreak_pending_nxt will take the value of hbreak_req. This ternary operator snoops on the current state and makes a decision on its future state.
