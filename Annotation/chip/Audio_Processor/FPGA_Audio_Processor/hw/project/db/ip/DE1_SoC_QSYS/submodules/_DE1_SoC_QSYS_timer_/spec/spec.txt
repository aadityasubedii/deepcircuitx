Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer. 

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer module is a device-level timer specifically designed for SoC systems. Its purpose is to precisely control the execution of operations based on the system clock. Through its various control parameters, this timer supports continuous operation or operation based on a triggered interruption. The inputs to this module include "address", "chipselect", "clk", "reset_n", "write_n", and "writedata". These inputs assist in dictating when data are fetched or stored, starting or stopping the timer, reloading the timer, notifying an interrupt, and determining what information to write into the timer module. The outputs from this timer module are "irq" and "readdata". The former signals when an interrupt event has occurred, while the latter outputs the values from selected registers. The internal signals used within this module perform a variety of tasks, including managing the running state of the timer, marking if a timer has hit zero, initiating a force reload of the timer, flagging timeout events, and providing snapshots of timer states. The code consists of various blocks, such as control registers, interrupts, timer operations, and read/write operations. Each of these sections is critical for the functioning of the timer, from setting its running parameters to managing feedback and response to external controls.
