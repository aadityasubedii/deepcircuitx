    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for synchronous reset and conditional data update. The logic block is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of the reset_n signal. If the reset_n signal is low, it sets the E_xbrk_traceon signal to 0, achieving a synchronous reset. If the reset_n signal is not low and the E_cpu_addr_en signal is high then it updates the value of E_xbrk_traceon with the value of xbrk_ton_hit."
