The block implements a typical synchronous reset pattern for the 'za_cannotrefresh' signal in a refresh control logic. At each rising edge of the 'clk' signal or the falling edge of the 'reset_n' signal, it checks the status of 'reset_n'. If 'reset_n' is 0, it resets 'za_cannotrefresh' to 0. If 'reset_n' is not 0, it assigns the logic AND of 'refresh_counter' being 0 and 'refresh_request' to 'za_cannotrefresh'.
