    "block_comment": "This line of code in Verilog represents an assignment operation inside a digital design. The function of the block is to pass the value of `D_ctrl_ignore_dst` to `R_ctrl_ignore_dst_nxt` in the next clock cycle. Being an assign statement, this is achieved by continuously assigning the value from the right side of the equation (`D_ctrl_ignore_dst`) to the left side (`R_ctrl_ignore_dst_nxt`)."
