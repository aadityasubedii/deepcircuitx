    "block_comment": "This block manages the output data under different conditions. It employs a combination of synchronous and asynchronous signals to control functionality. When an active low reset (reset_n) is asserted, the data_out becomes zero asynchronously. Conversely, when the chip is selected (chipselect) and it's not in a write state (denoted by active low write_n), and the address is zero, the lower 16 bits of data written (writedata[15 : 0]) are assigned to data_out synchronously with the clock's rising edge."
