    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for the control of a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) memory buffer. In the event of a reset (jrst_n == 0), it resets the read pointer (fifo_rdptr), the write pointer (fifo_wrptr), the FIFO counter (fifo_cnt), and sets the overflow indicator (overflow_pending) to pending. If not in reset state, it updates the write pointer and counter based on their increment values, modifies the read pointer if the FIFO is not empty, and manages the overflow indicator based on various conditions involving tracking and input flags. The overflow indicator is typically reset if there's valid data detected from either ATM or DTM."
