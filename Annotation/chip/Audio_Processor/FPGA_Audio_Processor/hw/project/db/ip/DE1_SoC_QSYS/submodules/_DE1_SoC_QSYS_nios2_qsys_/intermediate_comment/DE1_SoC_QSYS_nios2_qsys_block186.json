    "block_comment": "This block performs conditional data assignment for a shift or rotate operation in a processor design. If E_new_inst is true, the block assigns E_src1 value to E_shift_rot_result_nxt. If R_ctrl_shift_rot_right is true, right one bit rotation/shift is performed by appending E_shift_rot_fill_bit on the most significant bit after discarding the least significant bit. If both conditions are false, left one bit rotation/shift is operated by appending E_shift_rot_fill_bit at the least significant bit after discarding the most significant bit."
