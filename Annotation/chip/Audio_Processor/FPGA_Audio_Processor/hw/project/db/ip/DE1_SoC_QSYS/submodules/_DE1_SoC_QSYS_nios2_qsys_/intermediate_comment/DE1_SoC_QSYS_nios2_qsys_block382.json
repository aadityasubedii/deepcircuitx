    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code assigns a constant logical low (\"0\") to the signal 'dbrk2_traceon'. This sort of implementation is typically done to guarantee that the signal maintains a stable low value during the operational lifetime of the hardware, disregarding the influence of other parts of the circuitry. This is often applied in reset situations or when a certain feature (in this case, potentially a debug or trace functionality) is intended to be persistently turned off."
