    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for determining the next state of the `W_status_reg_pie_inst` signal. It does this via a cascading series of conditional statements (`?:`, the ternary operator) arranged in priority order. If `R_ctrl_exception`, `R_ctrl_break`, or `R_ctrl_crst` is true, `W_status_reg_pie_inst_nxt` will be set to `0`. Otherwise if `D_op_eret` is true, the value of `W_estatus_reg` is assigned, if `D_op_bret` is true, the value of `W_bstatus_reg` is assigned and if `E_wrctl_status` is true, the least significant bit of `E_src1` is assigned to `W_status_reg_pie_inst_nxt`. If none of the conditions are true, the current value of `W_status_reg_pie` is maintained."
