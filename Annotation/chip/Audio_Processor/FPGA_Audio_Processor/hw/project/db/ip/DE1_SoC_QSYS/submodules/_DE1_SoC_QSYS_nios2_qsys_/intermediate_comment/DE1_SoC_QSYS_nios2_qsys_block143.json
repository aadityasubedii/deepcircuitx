    "block_comment": "This block of code is a D-flip flop with synchronous reset in Verilog RTL. The flip flop captures the data at the positive edge of the clock or when there is a negative edge on the reset signal. If the reset signal is active low (reset_n = 0), it clears the output 'W_alu_result' to zero, otherwise, it captures the 'E_alu_result' and assigns it to 'W_alu_result'."
