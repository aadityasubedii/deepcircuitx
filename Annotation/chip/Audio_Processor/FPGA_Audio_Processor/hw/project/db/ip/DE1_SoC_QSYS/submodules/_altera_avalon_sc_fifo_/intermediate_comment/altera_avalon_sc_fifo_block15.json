    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the assignment of a flag indicating whether data might be approaching an empty state. This assignment is dependent on the conditional constant `USE_ALMOST_EMPTY_IF`. If this constant is true, the flag `almost_empty_data` gets assigned a value based on a comparison between `fill_level` and `almost_empty_threshold`, yielding true if `fill_level` is below the threshold and false otherwise. If the constant `USE_ALMOST_EMPTY_IF` is false, the `almost_empty_data` flag is always set to zero, indicating that the data does not approach an an empty state."
