This Verilog block is used for the data reading process where the reset operation is synchronous with the negative edge of the reset signal, while reading the data is synchronous with the positive edge of the clock signal. The block mainly implements a reset operation and a data read operation. In case of a reset (when reset_n is low), 'readdata' is set to zero. When the reset operation is not activated and the clock enable signal (clk_en) is high, the multiplexer output (read_mux_out) is read into 'readdata'.
