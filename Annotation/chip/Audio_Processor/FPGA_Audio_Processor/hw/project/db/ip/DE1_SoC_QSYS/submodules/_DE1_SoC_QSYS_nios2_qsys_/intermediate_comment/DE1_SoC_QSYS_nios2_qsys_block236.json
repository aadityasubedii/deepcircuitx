    "block_comment": "This block of code is assigning a value to the variable `i_address`. The value of `i_address` is determined by concatenating the value of `F_pc` with a 2-bit binary value '00', using the `{}` operator in Verilog. This is typically used in addressing applications where `F_pc` likely represents a significant part of an address and the '00' is used to append to the lesser significant bits of this address, typically done for alignment purposes."
