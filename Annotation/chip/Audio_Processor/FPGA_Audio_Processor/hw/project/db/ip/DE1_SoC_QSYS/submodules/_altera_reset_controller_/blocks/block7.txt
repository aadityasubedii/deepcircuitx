Comment: 
This block forwards the values of 'reset_out_pre2' and 'reset_req_pre' to 'reset_out' and 'reset_req' respectively. The assignment is done in a combinational always block, which means the outputs will update shortly after their corresponding input changes, hence creating a nearly instantaneous forwarder.
