    "block_comment": "This block of code is a single-line Verilog module that generates an action for Open Cores Interconnect (OCI) interrupt mask register. It implements this function by using the bitwise AND operation to combine `write_strobe`, a write control signal, and `oci_reg_01_addressed`, an indicator whether the right OCI register is addressed. Consequently, the resultant `take_action_oci_intr_mask_reg` signal becomes high when both a write operation is signaled and the correct OCI register is addressed; otherwise, it remains low."
