Comment: 
The given line of code is for assigning the logical shift control signal for the next verilog state. This code block uses the 'assign' keyword in Verilog to declare a continuously assigning relationship between the Logical_shift_control_signal for the next state (R_ctrl_shift_logical_nxt) and the current state (D_ctrl_shift_logical). Essentially, the line ensures that the R_ctrl_shift_logical_nxt always mirrors the state of D_ctrl_shift_logical.
