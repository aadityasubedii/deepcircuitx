Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls the status of a data storage element, such as a FIFO (First In First Out) queue, based on 'reset' and 'clk' signals. When the active-high 'reset' signal goes high, the storage element is flagged as empty and not full. But during normal operation, when the positive edge 'clk' signal arrives and the 'reset' signal is not active, the status bits 'empty' and 'full' are updated with 'next_empty' and 'next_full' values, respectively, which would be determined by other parts of the code. This effectively implements a synchronous reset mechanism for the storage element, allowing it to dynamically show its status based on recent data operation, either emptied or filled.
