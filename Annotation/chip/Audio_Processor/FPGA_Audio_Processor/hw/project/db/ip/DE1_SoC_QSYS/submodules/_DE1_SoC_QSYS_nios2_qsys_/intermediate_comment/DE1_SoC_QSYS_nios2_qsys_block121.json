    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code acts as a Register Assignment block, specifically for the Register \"W_ienable_reg\". The Register content for the next clock cycle (W_ienable_reg_nxt) is determined by a conditional operation. If both \"E_wrctl_ienable\" and \"E_valid\" are true, then the lower 32-bits (31:0) of \"E_src1\" are used. If either of them is false, the current contents of the \"W_ienable_reg\" Register are kept for the next cycle. Additionally, an AND operation with a 32-bit mask \"32'b00000000000000000000000000111111\" ensures that only the least significant six bits of the result can be non-zero."
