Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is essentially managing data storage in a two-stage pipeline under various conditions. On a high level, it clears the data storage (data0 and data1) on a reset signal, and it receives and stores input data in sequential order when not in reset mode. Specifically, the 'always' block is triggered on the positive edge of either the system clock or a reset signal. If a reset signal is detected, it zero-fills two arrays named 'data0' and 'data1'. If no reset signal is detected, but a system clock edge is, it first checks if 'data0' array is not full, if true, it stores the incoming data 'in_data' into 'data0'. Then, if 'data1' is either not full or both 'out_ready' and 'out_valid' flags are high, it stores the data from 'data0' into 'data1' if 'data0' is full, otherwise it directly stores the incoming data 'in_data' into 'data1'.
