Comment: 
This block of Verilog code performs a simple assignment operation where the system state (specifically the variables 'reset_out' and 'reset_req') are updated according to their pre-defined states - 'reset_out_pre' and 'reset_req_pre'. The action is executed for every change in the inputs due to the use of 'always @*' control structure, providing dynamic system response in a dense, implicit style.
