    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code checks if the `EMPTY_LATENCY` constant is equal to 3. If the condition is true, it initiates a block labeled as `gen_blk15`. This is a conditional compilation check which helps in customizing the hardware design based on the `EMPTY_LATENCY` constant. The code block or module that follows `begin : gen_blk15` will only be included and synthesized when `EMPTY_LATENCY == 3`. As this block does not provide the following implementation details of `gen_blk15`, additional code context is needed for a more exact summary."
