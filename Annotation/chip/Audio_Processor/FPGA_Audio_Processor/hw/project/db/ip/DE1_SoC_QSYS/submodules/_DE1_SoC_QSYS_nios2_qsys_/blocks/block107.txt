Comment: 
This block of code represents a flip flop with asynchronous reset. The code is triggered at the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset_n signal. If reset_n is '0', R_ctrl_jmp_indirect is reset to '0', irrespective of the clock signal condition. This acts as the asynchronous reset. Otherwise, if R_en signal is high, the value of R_ctrl_jmp_indirect_nxt is loaded into R_ctrl_jmp_indirect at the next positive clock edge, operating as a normal flip flop.
