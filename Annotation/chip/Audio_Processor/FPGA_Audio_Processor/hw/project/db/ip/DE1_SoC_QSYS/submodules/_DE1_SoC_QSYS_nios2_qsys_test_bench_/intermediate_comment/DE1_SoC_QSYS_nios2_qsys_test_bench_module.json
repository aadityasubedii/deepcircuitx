    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a test bench for the Nios II processor in the DE1-SoC QSYS system. It monitors processor signals, performs error checking, and verifies correct functionality by:\n1. Decoding and checking instruction operations\n2. Validating signal integrity and timing\n3. Filtering load data to handle undefined values\n4. Checking memory access operations and data alignment\n5. Monitoring register operations and write-back\nThe test bench uses numerous input signals from the processor and provides filtered load data as output, stopping simulation on detected errors."
