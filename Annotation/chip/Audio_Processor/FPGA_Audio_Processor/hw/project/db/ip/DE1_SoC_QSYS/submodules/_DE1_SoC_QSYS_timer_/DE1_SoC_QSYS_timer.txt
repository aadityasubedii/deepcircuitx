Module-level comment: This DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer module serves as a device-level timer with precise control, driven by the system clock. It supports continuous operation and interrupt-based operation, controlled by a set of input signals like "address", "chipselect", "clk", "reset_n", "write_n", and "writedata". Outcomes are discerned via two outputs: "irq" for interrupt notification and "readdata" for reading register values. Internally, this timer utilizes various signals for management such as running state, counter value, and timeout events. The code is divided into multiple sections responsible for control registration, timer operations, and read/write actions ensuring an efficient user or module interaction.
