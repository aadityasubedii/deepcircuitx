Comment: 
This Verilog code block is responsible for updating two registers, 'ir' and 'jdo', driven by positive edge of clock 'clk'. If the 'jxuir' signal is high, the 'ir' register is loaded with the value of 'ir_in'. Similarly, with 'update_jdo_strobe' signal high, the 'jdo' is loaded with 'sr' (the value currently in the shift register). Thus, this block essentially serves as a control mechanism for populating the 'ir' and 'jdo' registers based on specific conditions.
