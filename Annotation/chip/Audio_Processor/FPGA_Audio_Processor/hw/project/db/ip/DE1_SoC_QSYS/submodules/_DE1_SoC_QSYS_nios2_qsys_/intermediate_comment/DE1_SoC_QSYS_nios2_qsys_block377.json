    "block_comment": "This block is assigning a fixed logic level to a signal. The identified output signal 'dbrk3_trigout' is set to logic '0' consistently. This is achieved by using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog, which continuously drives the identified signal with the assigned value. Hence, the 'dbrk3_trigout' signal will always maintain a '0' logic level throughout the operation of the digital system."
