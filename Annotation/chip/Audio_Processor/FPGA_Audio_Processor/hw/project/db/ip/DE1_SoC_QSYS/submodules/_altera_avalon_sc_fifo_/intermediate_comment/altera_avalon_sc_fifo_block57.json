    "block_comment": "This block dynamically routes packet signals based on the `EMPTY_WIDTH` value. If `EMPTY_WIDTH` is greater than 0, it groups `in_startofpacket`, `in_endofpacket`, and `in_empty` signals into `in_packet_signals` and distributes `out_packet_signals` into `out_startofpacket`, `out_endofpacket`, and `out_empty`. Conversely, if `EMPTY_WIDTH` is 0 or less, `in_error` is fed to `out_empty`, while the `in_startofpacket` and `in_endofpacket` signals are grouped into `in_packet_signals` and the `out_packet_signals` are distributed to `out_startofpacket` and `out_endofpacket`."
