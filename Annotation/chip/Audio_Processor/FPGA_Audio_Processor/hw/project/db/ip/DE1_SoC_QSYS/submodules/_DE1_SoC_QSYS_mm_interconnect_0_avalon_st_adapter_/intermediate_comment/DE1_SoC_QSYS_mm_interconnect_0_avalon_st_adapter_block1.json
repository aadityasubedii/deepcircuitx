    "block_comment": "This block of code creates a parallel shift register in Verilog RTL. It uses a generate loop to create a linear array of D Flip-Flops according to the loop variable 'i', which determines the width of the shift register. For each loop iteration, the D input of each flip-flop is linked to the Q output of the previous one, thus creating a chain that shifts the input bit stream towards higher indexes in every clock cycle. A multiplexer is included at the input of the first flip-flop to choose between shifting the existing data and loading new data."
