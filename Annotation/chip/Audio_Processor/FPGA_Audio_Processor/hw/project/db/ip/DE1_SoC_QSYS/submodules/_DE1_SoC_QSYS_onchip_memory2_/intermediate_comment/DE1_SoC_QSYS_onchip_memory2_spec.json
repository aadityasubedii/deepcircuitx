    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2. \n\nModule specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2 module handles the functionality of an on-chip memory system for Altera's DE1 System-On-Chip platform. It is designed to control memory read/write operations and configures the on-chip memory (RAM) through parameters used for the Altera synchronous RAM (altsyncram) primitive. The module features various input ports including address lines (15-bit), byteenable signals (4-bit), control signals like chipselect, write, clk, clken, freeze, reset_req, reset and 32-bit wide writedata. These input ports provide control to memory read/write operations, address to access, data to write into memory, and synchronization signals. The module has a single 32-bit output port, readdata, which outputs the data read from the memory.\n\nInternally, this module defines three signals: clocken0, readdata, and wren. The clocken0 signal enables/disables the clock in absence/presence of a reset request respectively. The readdata signal holds the data read from RAM, and the wren signal indicates a write operation, active when both chipselect and write signals are active. \n\nThe module is structured around the 'altsyncram' primitive block. This block takes the input and control signals, and interfaces with the memory system for read/write operations. The parameters of the altsyncram block are set to define the memory system characteristics like size, depth, operation mode, etc. The data read from the memory is output via the readdata signal and is available at the output port accordingly. The operations are synchronized with the clock signal, and controlled by other control signals granting module comprehensive handling of the on-chip memory.",

The parameters used initialize the Altera synchronous RAM (altsyncram) primitive, configuring the on-chip memory (RAM). It operates in single port mode using input signals as control to perform write/read operations. It uses a parameterized 'INIT_FILE' to preload data into the memory during initialization. The 'byteenable' input signal is used for selecting specific bytes within the declared bus width to read from or write to, and 'chipselect' and 'write' signals fr unionized control for write operations. The data read from the RAM is output through 'readdata'. Other control signals serve the purpose of synchronizing and resetting the system."
