    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is assigned to handle the control state for write operations. It implements this by performing a bitwise AND operation between the write control instance (`R_ctrl_wrctl_inst`) and a condition that checks if the control register number (`D_iw_control_regnum`) is equal to the binary form of decimal 2. Such a design effectively ensures that write operations are executed under correct control states and specific register conditions."
