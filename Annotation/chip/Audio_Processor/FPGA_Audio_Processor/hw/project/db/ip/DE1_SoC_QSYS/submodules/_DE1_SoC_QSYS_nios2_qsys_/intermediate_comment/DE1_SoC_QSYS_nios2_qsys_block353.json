    "block_comment": "This line of code defines a logic condition that checks whether a synchronization timer has reached zero. This is done by using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog to create a continuous assignment statement that assigns the result of the equality comparison (sync_timer == 0) to the 'sync_timer_reached_zero' variable. When the value of 'sync_timer' equals zero, 'sync_timer_reached_zero' will be true (or high); otherwise, it will be false (or low)."
