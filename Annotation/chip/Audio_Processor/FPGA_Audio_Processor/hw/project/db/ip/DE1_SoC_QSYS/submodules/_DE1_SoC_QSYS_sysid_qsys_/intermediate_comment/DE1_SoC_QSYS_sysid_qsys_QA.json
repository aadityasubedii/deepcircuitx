It appears to be a simple synchronous system with a single output 'readdata' that outputs 1494430760 (an arbitrary number) when the input 'address' is high (non-zero), and 0 when 'address' is low. The functionality and purpose could be related to a system identification sequence in a simple system-on-chip (SoC).
