    "block_comment": "This block manages the enabling of a six stage FIFO buffer. It uses a combination of write pointers and buffer availability signals to set the 'fifo_6_enable'. The write pointer (fifo_wrptr) and other incremented pointers (fifo_wrptr_plus1, fifo_wrptr_plus2) are checked against the FIFO stage they are responsible to enable, and this is combined with signals indicating the availability of data to be written into the FIFO (input_ge1, input_ge2, input_ge3) along with signals to indicate free spots in the next stages (ge2_free, ge3_free). These conditions ensure optimal data flow through the FIFO buffer stages and prevent data loss."
