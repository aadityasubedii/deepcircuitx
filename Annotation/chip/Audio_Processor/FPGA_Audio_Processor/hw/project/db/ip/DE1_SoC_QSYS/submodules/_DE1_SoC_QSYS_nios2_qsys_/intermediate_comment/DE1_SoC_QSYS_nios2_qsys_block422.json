    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code serves the purpose of an asynchronous reset and synchronous set for the `E_xbrk_trigout` signal. On a negative edge of the `reset_n` signal, it performs an asynchronous reset, setting the `E_xbrk_trigout` signal to zero. On the positive edge of the `clk` signal, if `E_cpu_addr_en` is high, the block synchronously sets `E_xbrk_trigout` to the value of `xbrk_tout_hit`. The block uses edge-triggered design methodology for reliable clock operation and conditional control."
