    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the synchronization of reset signals depending on predefined macros and reset requests. If neither output reset synchronous edges is required ('none'), and there are no reset requests (RESET_REQUEST_PRESENT==0), it directly assigns the 'merged_reset' and 'merged_reset_req_in' to 'reset_out_pre' and 'reset_req_pre' respectively. If there are output synchronous edges or reset requests, the reset signals 'merged_reset' and 'merged_reset_req_in' are synchronized using Altera reset synchronizer modules with the input clock 'clk'. The synchronized reset signals are then mapped to 'reset_out_pre' and 'reset_req_pre'. The depth of synchronization is set by 'SYNC_DEPTH'. Moreover, 'ASYNC_RESET' is set true if a reset request is present in the first case."
