    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the behavior of write and read pointers in a synchronous system, typically for memory operation. It is designed to respond to either the positive edge of the system clock signal (`clk`) or a positive edge reset signal. In the event of a positive edge reset, both the write (`wr_ptr`) and read pointer (`rd_ptr`) are reset to zero. During the normal operation under a positive edge clock signal, the write and read pointers get the values from `next_wr_ptr` and `next_rd_ptr` respectively."
