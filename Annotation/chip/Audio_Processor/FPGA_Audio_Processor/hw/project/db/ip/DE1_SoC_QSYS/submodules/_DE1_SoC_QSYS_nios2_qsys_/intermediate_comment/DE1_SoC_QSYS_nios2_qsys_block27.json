    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for forwarding the current value of the `D_ctrl_b_is_dst` signal to the `R_ctrl_b_is_dst_nxt` output signal in the next clock cycle. This is achieved with a simple Verilog `assign` statement, which sets `R_ctrl_b_is_dst_nxt` equal to `D_ctrl_b_is_dst`. It's a simple wire assignment without any specific condition."
