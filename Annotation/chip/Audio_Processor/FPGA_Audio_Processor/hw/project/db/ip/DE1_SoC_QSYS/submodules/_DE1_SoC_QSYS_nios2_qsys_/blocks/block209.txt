Comment: 
This code block is assigned a value for the R_src2_lo variable. It functions as a multiplexer, choosing one of three possible options depending upon the condition. If either R_ctrl_force_src2_zero or R_ctrl_hi_imm16 is high, it forces R_src2_lo to be zero. If not, and if R_src2_use_imm is high, R_src2_lo will take the value of D_iw_imm16. If both conditions are not met, R_src2_lo will be assigned a 16-bit value currently in the register file, which is pointed to by R_rf_b[15 : 0].
