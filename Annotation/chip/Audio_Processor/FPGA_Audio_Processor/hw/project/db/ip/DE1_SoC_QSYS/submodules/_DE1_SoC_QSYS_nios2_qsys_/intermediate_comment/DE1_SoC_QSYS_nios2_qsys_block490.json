    "block_comment": "This block of code declares an assignment operation for a Verilog register. The register, referred to as \"oci_reg_00_addressed\", is assigned a boolean value based on whether the input 'address' equals to '9h100'. If 'address' does equal to '9h100', the register is assigned 'true'; otherwise, 'false'. Using the 'assign' keyword allows for continuous assignment, meaning that changes in the 'address' value result in instant updates to the value of 'oci_reg_00_addressed'."
