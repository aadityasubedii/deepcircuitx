    "block_comment": "This block assigns the `ge2_free` signal based on the inverse (`~`) or not of the 5th bit (`[4]`) of the `fifo_cnt`. Essentially, `ge2_free` becomes `true` if the fifth bit of `fifo_cnt` is `false` and vice versa. This assignment may perform a control function; if the fifth bit of the `fifo_cnt` is set, which might infer that the FIFO is full (or under a certain condition), `ge2_free` becomes `false` implying the 'not free' status."
