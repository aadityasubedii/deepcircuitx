    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements an SDRAM controller for memory operations. It manages read, write, and refresh cycles, handles initialization, and interacts with an input elastic FIFO. The controller uses a state machine to sequence operations, manages timing requirements, and generates appropriate control signals. It includes logic for address multiplexing, data masking, and refresh request handling, ensuring proper SDRAM functionality while interfacing with the system bus."
