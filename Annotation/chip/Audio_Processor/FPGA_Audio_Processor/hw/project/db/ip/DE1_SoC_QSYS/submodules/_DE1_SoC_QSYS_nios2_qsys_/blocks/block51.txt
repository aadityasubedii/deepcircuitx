Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is performing signal assignment for a control signal in a subsequent clock cycle. The non-blocking assignment operator (`=`) is used, meaning the right-hand side expression `D_ctrl_alu_subtract` is evaluated at the time of the assignment, and the result is placed in `R_ctrl_alu_subtract_nxt` at the end of the current clock cycle, preparing it for the next cycle. In essence, this block forwards the value of `D_ctrl_alu_subtract` signal to `R_ctrl_alu_subtract_nxt` to indicate whether a subtraction operation should occur in the following ALU cycle.
