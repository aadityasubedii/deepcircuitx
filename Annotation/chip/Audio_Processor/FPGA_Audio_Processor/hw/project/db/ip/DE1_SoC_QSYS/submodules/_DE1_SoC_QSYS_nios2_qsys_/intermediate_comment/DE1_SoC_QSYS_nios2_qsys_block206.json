    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a reset mechanism and conditional updating for the 'E_valid' signal in Verilog. When a falling edge appears on the 'reset_n' signal or a rising edge on 'clk' signal, it triggers an event. If 'reset_n' is low, it resets the 'E_valid' signal to 0. On the contrary, if 'reset_n' is not low, it means it's not in the reset condition, and 'E_valid' gets updated as the logical OR of 'R_valid' and 'E_stall'."
