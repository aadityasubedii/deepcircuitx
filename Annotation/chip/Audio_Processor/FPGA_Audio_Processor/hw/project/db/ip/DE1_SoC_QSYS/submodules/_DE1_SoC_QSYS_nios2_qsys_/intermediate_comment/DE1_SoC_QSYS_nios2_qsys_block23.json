    "block_comment": "This block of code models a flip-flop with an asynchronous reset control logic. When the 'reset_n' signal is on a falling edge (0), the registered ctrl_ignore_dst signal is reset to 0 instantly. However, under a positive edge of the clock signal and if the 'R_en' signal is true, the registered ctrl_ignore_dst signal will be updated with the next state (R_ctrl_ignore_dst_nxt) at each clock cycle."
