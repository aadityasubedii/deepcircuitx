Comment: 
The block of code assigns the state of a signal (`xbrk1_armed`) based on the conditions of specific bit positions in `xbrk_ctrl1` and the states of `trigger_state_0` and `trigger_state_1`. The logic is implemented using bitwise AND and logical OR operations. If the 5th bit of `xbrk_ctrl1` is set and `trigger_state_0` is true or the 6th bit of `xbrk_ctrl1` is set and `trigger_state_1` is true, `xbrk1_armed` will be set.
