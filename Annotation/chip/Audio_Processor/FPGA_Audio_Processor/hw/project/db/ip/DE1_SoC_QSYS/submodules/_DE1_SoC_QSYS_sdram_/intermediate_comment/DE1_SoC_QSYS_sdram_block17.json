    "block_comment": "This block is a Verilog implementation of a 2-entry memory writing system. This system activates on every rising edge of the clock signal when a write operation ('wr' signal) is asserted and the memory is not full ('full' negated). When the write operation is done, the 'wr_address' signal determines the target memory entry. If 'wr_address' is binary '1'd0', the incoming write data ('wr_data') is stored into 'entry_0'. Conversely, if 'wr_address' is binary '1'd1', 'wr_data' is written into 'entry_1'. The default case handles all other 'wr_address' values, but it is left empty in this context."
