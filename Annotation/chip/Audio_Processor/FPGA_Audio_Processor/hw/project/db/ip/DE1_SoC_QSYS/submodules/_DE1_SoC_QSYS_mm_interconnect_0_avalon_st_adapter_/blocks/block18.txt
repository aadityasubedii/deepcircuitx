Comment: 
The block of code here appears to be incomplete. Generally, in Verilog, 'generate' keyword is used for conditional or procedural generation of hardware structures. `inBitsPerSymbol != 34` points out to a conditional instruction, i.e., if the variable 'inBitsPerSymbol' is not equal to 34, then a certain code block should be executed. However, from the provided code fragment, it is unclear what this 'certain code block' is, so a complete contextual and functional interpretation isn't possible. Please provide a more complete block of code.
