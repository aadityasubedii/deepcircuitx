    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns a boolean value to the signal `xbrk3_armed` based on the bitwise AND operation of control signal `xbrk_ctrl3` contiguous elements with respective trigger states. If either of the operations is true, `xbrk3_armed` is set to true; otherwise, it's false. The trigger states and `xbrk_ctrl3` signals control whether the `xbrk3_armed` is activated or not."
