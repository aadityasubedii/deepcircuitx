Comment: 
The given block of code is a synchronous register update logic with an active-low reset. Operating on a positive edge of the clock or a negative edge of the reset signal, it resets the value of the register R_wr_dst_reg to 0 when the reset signal is active (reset_n == 0) in order to initialize the system. Otherwise, during normal operation (when reset signal is inactive), the content of D_wr_dst_reg is transferred to R_wr_dst_reg on each rising edge of the clock.
