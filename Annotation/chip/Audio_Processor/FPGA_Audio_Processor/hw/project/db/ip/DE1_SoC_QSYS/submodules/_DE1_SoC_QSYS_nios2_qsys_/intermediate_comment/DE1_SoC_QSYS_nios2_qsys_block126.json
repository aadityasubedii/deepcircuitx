    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating the value of the W_status_reg_pie_nxt register. It does this using conditional assignment based on the value of E_valid: if E_valid is true (1), then the next state of W_status_reg_pie_nxt is determined by the value of W_status_reg_pie_inst_nxt; otherwise, it retains its current value (W_status_reg_pie). This code block effectively manages the state transitions of W_status_reg_pie_nxt, using E_valid as the control signal."
