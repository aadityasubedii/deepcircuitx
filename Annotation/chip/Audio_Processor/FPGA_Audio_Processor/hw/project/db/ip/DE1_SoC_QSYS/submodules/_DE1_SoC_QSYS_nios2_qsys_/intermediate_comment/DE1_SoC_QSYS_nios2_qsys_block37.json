    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for setting the control signal `D_ctrl_ld_non_io`. The control signal is set to high whenever any one of the load operations (`D_op_ldbu`, `D_op_ldhu`, `D_op_ldb`, `D_op_ldh`, `D_op_ldw`, `D_op_ldl`) is activated. This Verilog code handles the logical control using bitwise OR operation between different load operations to activate the corresponding signal."
