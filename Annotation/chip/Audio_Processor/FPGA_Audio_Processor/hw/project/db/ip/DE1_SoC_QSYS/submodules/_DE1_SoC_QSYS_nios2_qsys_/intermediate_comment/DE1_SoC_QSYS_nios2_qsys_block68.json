    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a synchronous reset and shift operation in hardware. Triggered by either a positive edge of the clock signal (clk) or a negative edge of reset signal (reset_n), if the reset is active (`reset_n == 0`), the logic resets the register `R_ctrl_shift_rot` to 0. If not under the reset condition and the `R_en` (enable signal) is high, the `R_ctrl_shift_rot` register gets updated with `R_ctrl_shift_rot_nxt` value in the next clock cycle."
