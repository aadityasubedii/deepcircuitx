    "block_comment": "The block handles high 16-bit immediate control within data path logic operations. It functions by conducting a logical OR operation with `D_op_andhi`, `D_op_orhi`, and `D_op_xorhi` to control whether the higher 16-bit immediate value should be used in AND, OR, or XOR operations, facilitating flexibility in data path manipulation."
