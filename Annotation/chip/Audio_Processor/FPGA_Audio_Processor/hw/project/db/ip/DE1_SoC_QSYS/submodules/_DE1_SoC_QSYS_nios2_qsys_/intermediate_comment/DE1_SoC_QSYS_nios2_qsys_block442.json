    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to declare and initialize a wire named `xbrk2_ton_hit`. The purpose of this block of code is to create this wire signal and set its default value. The block achieves this by using the `assign` keyword in Verilog which is used to give a continuous assignment statement. In this specific case, `xbrk2_ton_hit` is given a constant value of `0`."
