    "spec": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base. \n\nModule specification: The altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base is a module that implements a pipeline concept which serves as a two-stage data buffer in Verilog hardware description language. This module captures input data in a synchronously clocked block and then transfers it to the next stage in the pipeline, with the flow of data controlled by ready-valid handshaking signals. It has two operating modes, namely, registered ready pipeline and unregistered ready pipeline, controlled by the parameter PIPELINE_READY.\n\nThe module uses several input ports which include clk (clock signal) to time changes in the pipeline, reset to clear pipeline data, in_valid as an indicator of valid incoming data, in_data as the incoming data itself, and out_ready which shows that the next system part is ready for data. The output ports include in_ready for controlling the inflow of data to the previous stage, out_valid as an indication of valid outgoing data, and out_data as the outgoing data itself. \n\nThe internal signals include full0 and full1 (flags indicating the fullness of the first and the second pipeline stages), data0 and data1 (registers holding data for the first and second pipeline stages), and DATA_WIDTH (a constant setting the width of the data registers and data ports in/out). The code is primarily divided into two parts: REGISTERED_READY_PLINE and UNREGISTERED_READY_PLINE. The REGISTERED_READY_PLINE section handles the operations of the pipeline when PIPELINE_READY is set to 1, ensuring proper data flow and control. The UNREGISTERED_READY_PLINE section handles operations when PIPELINE_READY is other than 1, essentially controlling the input readiness based on output readiness or the indication that the pipeline is not full. This module is designed to accommodate different data sizes/types and manages proper flow control by using these signals, parameters, and blocks.\n",

This module captures input data in a synchronously clocked block and then transfers it to the next stage in the pipeline, with the flow of data controlled by ready-valid handshaking signals. It has two operating modes, namely, registered ready pipeline and unregistered ready pipeline, controlled by the parameter PIPELINE_READY.\n\nThe module uses several input ports which include clk (clock signal) to time changes in the pipeline, reset to clear pipeline data, in_valid as an indicator of valid incoming data, in_data as the incoming data itself, and out_ready which shows that the next system part is ready for data. The output ports include in_ready for controlling the inflow of data to the previous stage, out_valid as an indication of valid outgoing data, and out_data as the outgoing data itself. \n\nThe internal signals include full0 and full1 (flags indicating the fullness of the first and the second pipeline stages), data0 and data1 (registers holding data for the first and second pipeline stages), and DATA_WIDTH (a constant setting the width of the data registers and data ports in/out). The code is primarily divided into two parts: REGISTERED_READY_PLINE and UNREGISTERED_READY_PLINE. The REGISTERED_READY_PLINE section handles the operations of the pipeline when PIPELINE_READY is set to 1, ensuring proper data flow and control. The UNREGISTERED_READY_PLINE section handles operations when PIPELINE_READY is other than 1, essentially controlling the input readiness based on output readiness or the indication that the pipeline is not full. This module is designed to accommodate different data sizes/types and manages proper flow control by using these signals, parameters, and blocks.\n"
