    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines the condition for dropping packets under certain error circumstances. The rule is expressed as a boolean expression under an `assign` statement for the `drop_on_error` variable. This rule is triggered when `drop_on_error_en` is set, indicating that the drop-on-error feature is enabled, and either `error_in_pkt` (error within the packet) or `in_pkt_error` (error with the incoming packet) is true, and the end of the packet (`in_pkt_eop_arrive`) has arrived. In addition, it checks that the start of the packet (`sop_has_left_fifo`) hasn't left the FIFO and that either the start of the packet hasn't left and the packet count isn't zero (`out_pkt_sop_leave & pkt_cnt_eq_zero`) both aren't true."
