    "block_comment": "This line of code is responsible for controlling the next state of the ALU Force XOR operation. This is done by assigning the current state of the `D_ctrl_alu_force_xor` to the `R_ctrl_alu_force_xor_nxt` for the next clock cycle. This enables the toggling of the XOR operation in the ALU on each clock cycle, increasing the versatility of the logic unit."
