    "block_comment": "This code block manages the control signal for some IO operations based on system clock and reset signal. During a negative edge of reset (when 'reset_n' is 0), this block sets 'R_ctrl_ld_io' to zero, initializing or resetting the control. On the other hand, when a positive edge of the clock signal ('clk') is detected while 'R_en' is enabled, this block updates 'R_ctrl_ld_io' with the value of 'R_ctrl_ld_io_nxt', facilitating the sequencer operation. Thus, this code can be considered as a part of a sequencer or a state machine controlling IO operations."
