The block assigns a 36-bit vector 'overflow_pending_dtm' with combined values from 'overflow_pending' and 'dtm'. In terms of implementation, the concatenate operation is achieved using curly brackets {}. Here, the most significant bit is represented by a 1-bit 'overflow_pending' signal and 35 bits from 'dtm' ranging from 34th bit to 0th bit form the remaining part of the vector.
