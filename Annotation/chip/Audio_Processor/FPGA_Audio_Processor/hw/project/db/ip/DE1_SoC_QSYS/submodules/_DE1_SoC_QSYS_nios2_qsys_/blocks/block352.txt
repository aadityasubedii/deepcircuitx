Comment: 
This block of code assigns the logical AND value of 'dct_is_taken' and 'sync_timer_reached_zero' to 'record_dct_outcome_in_sync'. If both 'dct_is_taken' and 'sync_timer_reached_zero' are TRUE, 'record_dct_outcome_in_sync' is set to TRUE, allowing events to be processed when a decision tree classification is used and a synchronous timer is complete.
