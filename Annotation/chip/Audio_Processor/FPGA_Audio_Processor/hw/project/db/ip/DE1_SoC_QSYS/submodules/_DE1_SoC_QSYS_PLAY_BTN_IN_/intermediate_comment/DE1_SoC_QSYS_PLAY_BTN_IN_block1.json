    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for edge detection. It achieves this function via a bitwise operation on two signals, 'd1_data_in' and 'd2_data_in'. Using the bitwise AND operator '&' in conjunction with the NOT operator '~', the block identifies the transition from '1' to '0' (a falling edge) on the 'd1_data_in' signal relative to the 'd2_data_in' signal."
