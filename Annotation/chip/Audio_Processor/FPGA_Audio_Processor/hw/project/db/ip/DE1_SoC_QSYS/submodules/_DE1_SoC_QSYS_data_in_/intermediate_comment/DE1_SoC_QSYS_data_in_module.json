    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_data_in module, designed for Altera DE1-SoC FPGA board, acts as a multiplexer and memory element. It selects 16 bits of data from 'in_port' based on a 2-bit 'address' and latches the selected data onto a 32-bit register 'readdata'. The module uses a clock enable wire 'clk_en' for timing control and an intermediary 'read_mux_out' for data selection. A check for clock edges or reset conditions is performed before any data transfer, thereby ensuring synchronized operations."
