    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as an edge-triggered, asynchronous-reset FIFO cell. It is designed to handle FIFO operations, being sensitive to both rising edge of the clock signal and the falling edge of the reset signal. Upon a negative reset, the FIFO cell is reset to 0; otherwise, if 'fifo_11_enable' is high (true), the FIFO cell takes the value from the 'fifo_11_mux' line."
