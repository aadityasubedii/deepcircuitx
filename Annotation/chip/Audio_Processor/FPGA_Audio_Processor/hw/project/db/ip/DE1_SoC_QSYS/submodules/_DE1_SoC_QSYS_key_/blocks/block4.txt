The block of code captures and resets an edge signal. When there is a rising edge on the clock signal or a falling edge on reset_n signal, the code is executed. If reset_n equals zero, the code directs edge_capture[2] to reset to zero. Otherwise, if the clock enable, clk_en is set, the code will check the status of edge_capture_wr_strobe and edge_detect[2]. If the edge_capture_wr_strobe value is true, it will reset edge_capture[2] to zero. If not, and the edge_detect[2] returns true, it will set edge_capture[2] to -1, indicating the detection of an edge. This mechanism is used to capture and reset the signal at the desired edge, whether at positive or negative transitions.
