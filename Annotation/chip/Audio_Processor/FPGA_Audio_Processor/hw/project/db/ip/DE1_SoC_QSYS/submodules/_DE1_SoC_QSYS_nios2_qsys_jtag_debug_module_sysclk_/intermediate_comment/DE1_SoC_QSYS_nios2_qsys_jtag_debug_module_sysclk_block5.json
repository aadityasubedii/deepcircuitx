    "block_comment": "The block of code generates a control signal, named 'take_no_action_break_b', that is responsible for taking no action and breaking if certain conditions are met. The 'take_no_action_break_b' signal assignment is enabled when 'enable_action_strobe is high (TRUE), the instruction register 'ir' holds the binary value '10', and the 36th bit of the 'jdo' register is high while both the 35th and 37th bits are low."
