    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a signal indicating an occurrence of a 'ton hit' event in any of the four considered cases (xbrk0, xbrk1, xbrk2, xbrk3). It implements this through the use of a bitwise OR operator, which checks each individual 'ton hit' signal. If any of the signals are true ('ton hit' event occurred), the resultant 'xbrk_ton_hit' will also be true."
