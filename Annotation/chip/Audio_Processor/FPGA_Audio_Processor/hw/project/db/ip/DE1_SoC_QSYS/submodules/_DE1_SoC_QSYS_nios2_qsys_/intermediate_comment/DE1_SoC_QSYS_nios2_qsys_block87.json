    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the next state for a control signal. Specifically, the present state of the unconditional control transfer instruction (CTI), which is not a branch operation, from the Decode stage (D_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br) is assigned to be the next state in the Register (R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br_nxt). This assignment is made on every active edge of the clock ensuring that the next state for this control signal is updated and ready to go, facilitating its use in the following clock cycle."
