Comment: 
This block of code is used for generating an interrupt signal `irq`. It uses a bitwise OR operation (`|`) and a bitwise AND operation (`&`) on the `edge_capture` and `irq_mask` signals to accomplish this task. If there is any bit that is high (1) in both `edge_capture` and `irq_mask`, then the `irq` signal will be asserted, triggering the interrupt. This logic allows the system to selectively respond to specific conditions marked by the `edge_capture` signal, driven by the enabling mechanism provided by the `irq_mask`.
