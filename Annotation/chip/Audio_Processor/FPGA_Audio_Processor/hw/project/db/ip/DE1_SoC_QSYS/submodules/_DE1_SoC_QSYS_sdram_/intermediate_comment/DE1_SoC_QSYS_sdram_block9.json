    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is used to perform memory bank selection and matching operations in a digital system where there are specific rules to access or write data from/to different memory banks. The functions are implemented by assigning values to variables using bitwise operations, comparison, logical and conditional operations between the active (currently being read/written) and future (set for upcoming operations) values of certain signals including the chip select, read/write control, bank address and row address. The logic also takes into consideration whether the future queue is empty or not. The least significant 10 bits of Column Address Strobe (CAS) are chosen based on the 'f_select' flag."
