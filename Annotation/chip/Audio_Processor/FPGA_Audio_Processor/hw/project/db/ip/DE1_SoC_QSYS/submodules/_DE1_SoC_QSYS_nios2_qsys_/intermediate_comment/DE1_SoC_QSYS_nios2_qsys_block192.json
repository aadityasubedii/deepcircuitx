    "block_comment": "The block of code is used for extracting the sign bit of the arithmetic result. This is achieved by implementing an assign statement on signal 'E_lt' which takes the 32nd bit from 'E_arith_result' - as Verilog uses 0-based indexing, it refers to the 33rd bit, often used as the sign bit in a 32-bit word."
