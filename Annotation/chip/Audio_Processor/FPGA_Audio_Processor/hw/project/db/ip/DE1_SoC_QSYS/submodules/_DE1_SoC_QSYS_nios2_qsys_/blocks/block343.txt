This block of code defines a module DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_nios2_oci_td_mode which extracts specific control bits to determine the test mode for a system. It achieves this by taking in a variable called "ctrl" and using the part of it specified by the range 7 to 5, consequently assigning it to the variable "ctrl_bits_for_mux". The output, "td_mode", is driven by this result. The decoding scheme to determine the "td_mode" from the control bits, "ctrl_bits_for_mux", is not shown in this block of code.
