    "block_comment": "This block of code is a Flip-Flop structure in the Verilog RTL typically used for data storage. It behaves according to the clock (clk) and an asynchronous reset signal (reset_n). On the negative edge of reset_n, it forces a reset by setting the R_logic_op output to 0. On the rising edge of the clock pulse (clk), if reset_n is not 0 (indicating no reset), it assigns the current value of D_logic_op to R_logic_op, effectively updating its value."
