The block of code implements a flip-flop that captures signal edges. The flip-flop is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal. The code first checks if the reset signal is active; if so, it resets the flip-flop and sets `edge_capture[1]` to zero. If the reset is not active but the clock enable (`clk_en`) is, it checks if `edge_capture_wr_strobe` is true, in which case it will set `edge_capture[1]` to zero, or if `edge_detect[1]` is true, will set `edge_capture[1]` to -1. This ensures edge detection and capture based on certain conditions.
