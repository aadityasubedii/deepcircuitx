    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code block serves as a register that holds the value of `D_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison` for the next clock cycle. This is achieved by using the `assign` keyword, which establishes a continuous assignment statement. This continually assigns the value of `D_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison` to `R_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison_nxt` as soon as it changes, effectively maintaining the value of `D_ctrl_alu_signed_comparison` for the following clock cycle."
