    "block_comment": "The block of code serves as a non-blocking assignment in a Verilog model. It assigns the value of the current control branch `D_ctrl_br` to the next control branch `R_ctrl_br_nxt`. This is achieved using the assignment operator `assign` that computes the right-hand side `D_ctrl_br` before making the assignment to the left-hand side `R_ctrl_br_nxt`. In Verilog, the non-blocking assignment allows scheduled assignments to occur in a way that reduces simulation variance. This assignment is typically used in generating sequential logic."
