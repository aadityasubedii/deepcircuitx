    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code represents a refresh counter for a hardware module. When a negative reset signal is detected (not-active high), the counter is reset to a value of 14300. If the counter already equals zero, it is set to 1117. In the absence of reset or if the counter doesn't equal zero, the counter gets decremented by one at every positive edge of the clock signal. This design is predominantly used in memory controller refresh cycles to avoid data loss, utilizing a synchronous reset to initialize the counter."
