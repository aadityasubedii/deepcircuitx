    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the write enable signal of an On-Chip RAM (ociram_wr_en) in a Verilog-based digital system. It employs a conditional (ternary) operator, assigning the write enable signal based on whether JTAG RAM access has been triggered (jtag_ram_access). If JTAG RAM access is active, jtag_ram_wr is assigned to ociram_wr_en; otherwise, avalon_ram_wr serves as the signal source."
