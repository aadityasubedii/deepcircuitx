This block represents a synchronous circuit that is initially set to a reset state when the 'reset_n' signal is active. When the 'clk' signal experiences a positive edge or the 'reset_n' experiences a negative edge, the circuit enters a state that depends on conditions based on 'hbreak_enabled' and 'oci_single_step_mode' signals. If 'reset_n' is not active, 'wait_for_one_post_bret_inst' takes on the boolean value of a logical operation between 'hbreak_enabled', 'oci_single_step_mode', and 'F_valid'. Specifically, if 'hbreak_enabled' is inactive and 'oci_single_step_mode' is active, it is set to be TRUE, else it is dependent on 'F_valid' or the negation of 'oci_single_step_mode'. If none of these conditions are true, it retains its last state.
