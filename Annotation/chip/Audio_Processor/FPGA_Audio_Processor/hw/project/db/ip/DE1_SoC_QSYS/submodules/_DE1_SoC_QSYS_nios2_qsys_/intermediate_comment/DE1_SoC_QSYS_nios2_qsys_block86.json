    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the control signal `R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br` for an unspecified digital system. Upon receiving a negative edge signal on `reset_n`, the system resets `R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br` to 0, ensuring it's in a known initial state. During a positive edge on `clk`, if enable signal `R_en` is high, then `R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br` is updated with the next state kept in `R_ctrl_uncond_cti_non_br_nxt`. This logic governs their transition, aiding in synchronization with the system clock."
