    "block_comment": "This line of code is for the assignment of the next state of a control signal in a finite state machine. The control signal for the next cycle (R_ctrl_st_nxt) is assigned the present state signal D_ctrl_st using a non-blocking assignment operation. This helps to avoid race conditions or issues with order of execution in simulations where states could otherwise be updated simultaneously."
