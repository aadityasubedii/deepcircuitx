Comment: 
This block signifies a synchronous flip flop with an active-low reset and clock as control signals. The flip flop captures or updates the value of `R_ctrl_rot_right_nxt` into `R_ctrl_rot_right` at the rising edge of the clock `clk` if the enable signal `R_en` is high. If the reset signal `reset_n` is low, it resets the `R_ctrl_rot_right` to zero, overriding any other input conditions.
