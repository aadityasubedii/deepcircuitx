    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a flip-flop with asynchronous reset functionality. Whenever the 'clk' signal experiences a rising edge or the 'reset_n' signal experiences a falling edge, the block is activated. If 'reset_n' drops to 0, meaning reset is active, the output 'R_ctrl_break' is forced to 0 for initialization. However, if the reset is not active, and enable signal 'R_en' is high, then 'R_ctrl_break' is updated with the value of 'R_ctrl_break_nxt' at the next clock cycle."
