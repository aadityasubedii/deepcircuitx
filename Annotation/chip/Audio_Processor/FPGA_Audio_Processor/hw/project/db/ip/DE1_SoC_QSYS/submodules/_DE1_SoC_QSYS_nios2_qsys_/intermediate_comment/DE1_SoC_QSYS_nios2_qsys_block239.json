    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a bit-wise operation in Verilog RTL design. Specifically, it concatenates two bits of zero ('00') to the least significant bit side of `F_pc_plus_one`. The result of this operation is then assigned to `F_pcb_plus_four`. The purpose of this operation is typically to increase the effective value of `F_pc_plus_one` by a factor of four, assuming it is being used as an address or pointer."
