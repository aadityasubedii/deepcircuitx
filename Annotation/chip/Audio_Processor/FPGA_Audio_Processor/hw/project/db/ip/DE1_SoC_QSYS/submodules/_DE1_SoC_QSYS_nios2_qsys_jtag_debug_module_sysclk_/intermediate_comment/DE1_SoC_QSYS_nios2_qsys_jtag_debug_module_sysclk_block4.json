    "block_comment": "This block of code enables a specific action if certain conditions are met. It assigns the \"take_action_break_c\" signal a value based on the logical AND of several inputs: \"enable_action_strobe\", two specific bits of the \"ir\" register, and three specific bits of the \"jdo\" bit vector. This action is taken when enable action strobe is true, the \"ir\" register value is '2'b10' (binary for 2), and the 36th, 35th, and 37th bits of \"jdo\" are all '1'."
