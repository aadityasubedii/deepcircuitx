Comment: 
The code block acts as a conditional switch for the next state of the shift or rotate operation count (E_shift_rot_cnt_nxt) in a hardware design. When a new instruction (E_new_inst) is fetched, the block assigns the lower five bits of the second source operand (E_src2[4 : 0]) to the shift/rotate counter. If a new instruction is not fetched, the block decrements the current counter (E_shift_rot_cnt-1).
