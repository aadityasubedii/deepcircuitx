    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the assignment of the value to the variable 'tw'. If the condition '0' is true (which is never), the tristate variable 'tw' is assigned the value composed of the concatenation of two fields of the fifo_head: the first (high-order) field is either '0' or the 32nd to 35th bits of fifo_head (this depends on the value of the boolean variable 'empty'), and the second field is the 0th to the 31st bits of fifo_head. Otherwise, 'tw' is assigned the value of 'itm'."
