Comment: 
This block assigns a default high value of 0 to the signal 'dbrk1_high_value'. This is achieved through the use of the 'assign' keyword, which in Verilog is used to establish continuous assignments, meaning that the right-hand side expression is always evaluated when there is any change in its operand. In this case, 'dbrk1_high_value' will always be 0, regardless of any other operations or changes.
