    "block_comment": "This block of code ensures the synchronization of the CPU wait signal with the Data wait request signal. The implemented functionality is straightforward, assigning the CPU wait signal (`cpu_d_wait`) the value of Data wait request signal (`d_waitrequest`). This means whenever the `d_waitrequest` signal is high, the `cpu_d_wait` signal also goes high, thus making the CPU wait till the data request is processed."
