This block of code performs the functionality of a write operation to a memory array when write enable signal is active in a synchronous manner by using `wrclock`. The write operation is carried out on the transition of `wrclock` (Writing edge - rising edge). It checks if the `wren` (write enable) has been activated, and if so, it writes the `data` to the address given by `wraddress` in the `mem_array` with the help of non-blocking assignment operator `<=`.
