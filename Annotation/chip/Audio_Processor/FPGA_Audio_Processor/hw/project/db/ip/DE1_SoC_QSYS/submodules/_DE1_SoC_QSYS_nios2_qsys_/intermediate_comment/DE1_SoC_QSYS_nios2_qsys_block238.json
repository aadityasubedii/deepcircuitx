    "block_comment": "This block of code generates the signal 'F_valid'. 'F_valid' is true only when 'i_read' is asserted and 'i_waitrequest' is not asserted. The function is implemented using an assignment ('assign') statement and a bitwise AND operator (&) combined with a bitwise NOT operator (~). This means 'F_valid' will become true whenever a read request is made and there is no wait request pending."
