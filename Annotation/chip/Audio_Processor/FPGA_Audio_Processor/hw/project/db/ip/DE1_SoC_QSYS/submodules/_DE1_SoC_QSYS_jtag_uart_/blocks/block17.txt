Comment: 
This Verilog module serves as the implementation of a write-side FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer for a JTAG UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) system on the DE1-SoC QSYS platform. The FIFO buffer is critical for managing the flow of write data at the rate that can be accommodated by the UART. It handles signals for data writing (fifo_wdata), fifo write enable (fifo_wr), and fifo clear (fifo_clear) on the input and communicates state of the FIFO buffer via fifo full (fifo_FF), write fifo empty (wfifo_empty), and write fifo used (wfifo_used) on the output. Instantiation of the DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_sim_scfifo_w module manages these signals and data flows in the FIFO buffer.
