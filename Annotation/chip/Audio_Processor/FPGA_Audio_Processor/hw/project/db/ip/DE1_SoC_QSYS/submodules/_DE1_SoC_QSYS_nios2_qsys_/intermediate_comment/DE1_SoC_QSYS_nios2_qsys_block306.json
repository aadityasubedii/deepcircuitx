    "block_comment": "This block of code controls a flip-flop for a FIFO (First In, First Out) queue, acting as a FIFO controller. It waits for a positive edge of a clock or a negative edge of the reset signal (a synchronised reset). When a reset is triggered, the FIFO queue is emptied by setting the value of `fifo_4` to 0. However, if the reset isn't triggered and the `fifo_4_enable` condition is met, `fifo_4` is updated with the value from `fifo_4_mux`. This implementation ensures that the block resets the FIFO queue or updates the value of `fifo_4` with each clock cycle, achieving synchronous control for the FIFO queue."
