    "block_comment": "This block of code is defining a condition for loading data from a memory interface. It uses an AND operation between 'd_read' and the negation of 'd_waitrequest' to manage data retrieval. If 'd_read' is true suggests that a read operation is requested, and if 'd_waitrequest' is false indicates that the system is not waiting for any other memory operations to complete before proceeding. When both conditions are met (i.e., 'd_read' = 1 and 'd_waitrequest' = 0), 'av_ld_getting_data' is set to true."
