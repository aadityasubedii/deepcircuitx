Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll module serves as a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) in an Altera SoC system. It utilizes a reference clock (refclk) and reset signal (rst) to output two clock signals (outclk_0, outclk_1) and a signal indicating the lock status (locked). The functionality is achieved by instantiating an Altera-provided altera_pll module, configured via specific parameters to generate the desired clock frequencies and phase shifts. Inputs refclk and rst, and outputs outclk_0, outclk_1, and locked enable interaction with the system.
