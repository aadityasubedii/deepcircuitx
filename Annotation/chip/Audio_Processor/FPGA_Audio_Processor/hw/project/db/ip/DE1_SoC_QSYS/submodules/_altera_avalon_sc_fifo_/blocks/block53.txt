This block of code handles the writing and reading operations of an internal memory (mem) in a synchronous manner. It writes an input payload (in_payload) to the memory (mem) array at the write pointer (wr_ptr) location whenever a valid input signal (in_valid) and an input-ready signal (in_ready) are simultaneously asserted. Meanwhile, the block always fetches data from the memory array, using an internal read pointer (mem_rd_ptr), and assigns it to the internal_out_payload variable on each rising edge of the clock (clk).
