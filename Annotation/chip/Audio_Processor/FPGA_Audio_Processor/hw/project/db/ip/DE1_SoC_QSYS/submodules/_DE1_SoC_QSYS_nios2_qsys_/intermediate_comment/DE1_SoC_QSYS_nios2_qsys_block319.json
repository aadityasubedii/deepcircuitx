    "block_comment": "The block controls and enables a FIFO buffer in a system. The enable signal `fifo_0_enable` is computed using logical operations on other signals in the system. It enables the FIFO buffer when write pointer is at address 0 and input `input_ge1` is high, or when `ge2_free` is high, write pointer plus 1 is at address 0, and input `input_ge2` is high, or when `ge3_free` is high, write pointer plus 2 is at address 0, and input `input_ge3` is high. The purpose is to ensure proper and safe operations of FIFO buffer without overlap or data overflow."
