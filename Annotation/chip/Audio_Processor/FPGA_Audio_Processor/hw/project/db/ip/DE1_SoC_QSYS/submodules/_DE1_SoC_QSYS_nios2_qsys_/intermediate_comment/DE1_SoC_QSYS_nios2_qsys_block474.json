    "block_comment": "The block designates a low-level or zero value to a signal or variable in Verilog code, specifically to 'dbrk1_low_value'. This is achieved simply through the use of 'assign' statement. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog is utilized to continuously drive a register or a wire with a certain value, in our case the zero value. This is a simple assignment operation with no internal logic or manipulation involved."
