    "block_comment": "This block of code manages data assigned to the `fifo_14_mux` signal based on various conditions related to FIFO write pointers and validity flags. If the FIFO write pointer (`fifo_wrptr`) is equal to 14, the signal takes the value of `itm` if `itm_valid` is true, `overflow_pending_atm` if `atm_valid` is true and `overflow_pending_dtm` if `dtm_valid` is true. If the incremented FIFO write pointer (`fifo_wrptr_plus1`) equals 14 and `ge2_free` is true along with any two out of `itm_valid`, `atm_valid`, `dtm_valid`, appropriate overflow signal is assigned, prioritizing `atm` and `dtm` over `itm`. In all other cases, it defaults to `overflow_pending_dtm`."
