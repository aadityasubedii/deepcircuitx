    "block_comment": "The block of code handles the read operation of a FIFO queue. When 'av_chipselect' is selected and read operation 'av_read_n' is not active, 'av_waitrequest' is asserted and 'av_address' is not present, the output 'fifo_rd' is the inverted state of 'fifo_EF' (an Empty Flag for the FIFO). Else, 'fifo_rd' is set to zero. This selective assignment ensures the read operation is properly synchronized with the availability of data in the FIFO queue."
