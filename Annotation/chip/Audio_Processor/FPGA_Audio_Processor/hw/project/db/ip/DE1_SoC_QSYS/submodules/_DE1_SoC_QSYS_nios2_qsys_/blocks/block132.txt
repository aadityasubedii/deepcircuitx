This block assigns the value of 'W_status_reg_pie' to the 'W_status_reg' register. It's essentially a wire assignment in Verilog which could occur continuously and instantly whenever the value of 'W_status_reg_pie' changes, based on combinational logic, the value of 'W_status_reg' will immediately reflect the change. This is a single line code section primarily doing data forwarding.
