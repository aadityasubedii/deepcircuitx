Comment: 
This block of code represents a synchronous data input pipeline module in Verilog. It works based on the positive edge of the system clock (clk) or the negative edge of the reset signal (reset_n). When a reset is applied with a low level (reset_n==0), it forces the input data D_iw to a known state, zero. But on each positive clock edge, if the F_valid signal is high, the contents of F_iw will be transferred to D_iw.
