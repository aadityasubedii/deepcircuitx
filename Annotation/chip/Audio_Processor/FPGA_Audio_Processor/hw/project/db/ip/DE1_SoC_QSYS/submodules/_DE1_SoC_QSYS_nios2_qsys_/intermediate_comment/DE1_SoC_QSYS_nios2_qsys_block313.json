    "block_comment": "The block of code is a conditional logic that determines the enabling of the second FIFO memory-block (fifo_2_enable). The FIFO enable signal is asserted if one of the three cases occur: (1) the FIFO write pointer is at position '2' and input_ge1 is valid; (2) ge2_free is available and the incremented write pointer is at position '2' with a valid input_ge2; (3) ge3_free is obtainable, the write pointer incremented twice lands at position '2', and a valid input_ge3 is present."
