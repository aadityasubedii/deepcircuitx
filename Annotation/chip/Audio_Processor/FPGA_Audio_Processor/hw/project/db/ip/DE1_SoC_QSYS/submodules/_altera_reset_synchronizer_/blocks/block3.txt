Comment: 
This block of Verilog code performs synchronization of the reset signal. On each positive edge of the clock, the previous bits of `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` are shifted down by one bit, and the new reset_in signal is taken as the most significant bit of the array. The least significant bit of this chain array is then output as `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`. This creates a synchronizer chain that can mitigate metastability issues often associated with asynchronous reset signals.
