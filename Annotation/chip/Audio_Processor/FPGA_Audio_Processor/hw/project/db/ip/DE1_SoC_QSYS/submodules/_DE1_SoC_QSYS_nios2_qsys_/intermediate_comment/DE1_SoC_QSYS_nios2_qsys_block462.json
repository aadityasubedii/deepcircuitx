    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is responsible for controlling the break_readreg register based on various conditions. Depending on the clock edge, the break read register is updated. If reset is active, all break read registers are cleared. If any break action is activated, the break read register is loaded with 'jdo' value. In case of actions break_a, with specific high and low bits, selected break registers take the appropriate 'xbrk' or 'dbrk' values. In all other scenarios, 'jdo' value is loaded back to the break read register."
