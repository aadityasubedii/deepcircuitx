    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning a value to the R_src2 signal, effectively defining its state. This is achieved by concatenating the values of R_src2_hi and R_src2_lo, with R_src2_hi as the most significant part and R_src2_lo as the least significant part, thus forming a wider bus signal. The 'assign' keyword is used to create a continuous assignment statement, which means R_src2's value will be updated whenever R_src2_hi or R_src2_lo change."
