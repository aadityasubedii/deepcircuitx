    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the 'trigger_state' value to the 'trigger_state_1'. The 'assign' statement in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements, which entails that the block of code functions to keep 'trigger_state_1' and 'trigger_state' at the same value at all times. As such, whenever 'trigger_state' gets updated, 'trigger_state_1' will immediately get updated with the same value."
