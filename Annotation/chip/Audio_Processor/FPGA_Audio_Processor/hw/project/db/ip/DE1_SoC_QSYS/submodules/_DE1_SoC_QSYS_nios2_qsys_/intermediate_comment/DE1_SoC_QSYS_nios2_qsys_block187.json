    "block_comment": "The block assigns a value to `E_shift_rot_fill_bit` based on certain conditions. It checks if logical shifting is selected via `R_ctrl_shift_logical`. If true, the block assigns `0` to `E_shift_rot_fill_bit`. If not, and if right rotation is selected via `R_ctrl_rot_right`, it takes the least significant bit from `E_shift_rot_result`. If neither condition is true, it takes the most significant bit from `E_shift_rot_result`."
