Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is dedicated to the task of enabling the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer queue addressed at location 7 (fifo_7_enable). The block manages this task through complex conditional logic, checking multiple conditions that must be matched to switch on the FIFO buffer. The checks include matching the write pointer of the FIFO buffer (fifo_wrptr) with the constant 4'd7 and checking if input_ge1 is high. Alternatively, it assesses whether the queue location ahead of current write pointer (fifo_wrptr_plus1 or fifo_wrptr_plus2) equals 4'd7 in conjunction with ge2_free or ge3_free flags being high, and input_ge2 or input_ge3 being high. If these conditions pass, fifo_7_enable is assigned a high value, indicating that data can be written into the FIFO buffer at the 7th address.
