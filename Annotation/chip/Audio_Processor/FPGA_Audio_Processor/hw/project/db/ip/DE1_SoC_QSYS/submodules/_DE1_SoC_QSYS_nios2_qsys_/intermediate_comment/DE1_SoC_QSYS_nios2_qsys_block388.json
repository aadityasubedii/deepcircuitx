    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a net 'dbrk1_goto0' in Verilog HDL. The single bit value '1'b0' is immediately assigned to 'dbrk1_goto0', which implies this net will always carry the value '0' throughout the design. This type of assignment is usually performed for default signal assignment, flag status or to keep a pin/logic to a constant digital level. Therefore, this net can be fundamentally used as a constant LOW signal in the circuit."
