Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for controlling whether the second source of the block R should be forced to zero. The logic for this control is implemented as a flip-flop with asynchronous active low reset. The reset condition, where reset_n == 0, sets the `R_ctrl_force_src2_zero` signal to 0 regardless of clock state. However, when reset_n is not active and the enable signal `R_en` is high at a positive edge of the clock pulse, the value of `R_ctrl_force_src2_zero` gets updated to `R_ctrl_force_src2_zero_nxt` value.
