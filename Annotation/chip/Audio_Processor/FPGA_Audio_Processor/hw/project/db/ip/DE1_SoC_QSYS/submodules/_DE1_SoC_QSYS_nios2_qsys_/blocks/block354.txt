This block assigns a value to `sync_interval` based on some operations involving `sync_code` bits. Specifically, it forms `sync_interval` by concatenating multiple bits and bit-wise operations involving `sync_code`: the AND of bit 1 and 0 of `sync_code` followed by a zero, the AND of bit 1 of `sync_code` and the negation of bit 0, another zero, the AND of the negated bit 1 and bit 0 of `sync_code`, and finally two zeroes.
