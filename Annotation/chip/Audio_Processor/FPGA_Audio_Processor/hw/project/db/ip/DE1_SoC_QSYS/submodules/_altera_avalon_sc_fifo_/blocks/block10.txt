Comment: 
This block manages a FIFO queue's control and status register (CSR) operations and FIFO thresholds. Upon reset, it sets the 'almost_full_threshold' to the maximum FIFO size, 'almost_empty_threshold' and 'csr_readdata' to 0. If not in reset, the block handles read and write operations from the CSR. For reading, it checks the 'csr_address' and assigns appropriate data to 'csr_readdata'. For writing, it checks the address and updates either 'almost_empty_threshold' or 'almost_full_threshold' with 'csr_writedata'. Thus, the block facilitates dynamic FIFO control based on the CSR's instructions.
