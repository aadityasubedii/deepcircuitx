Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is used for generating a write strobe signal for a snapshot latch (snap_l). The signal, snap_l_wr_strobe, is generated when all of the following conditions are met: the chip is selected (chipselect is high), a write operation is not in progress (~write_n is high), and the address provided is '4'.
