    "block_comment": "This block is primarily concerned with maintaining the fill level state of the FIFO buffer. It does so by being sensitive to the rising edge of the system's clock signal or the reset state of the system. When a reset signal is given, the fill level of FIFO buffer is set to zero. If the FIFO buffer reaches its full state and there's no error occurred (i.e., not in a drop on error condition), the fill level is updated to reach the depth of the FIFO, which is calculated from the address width. However, if neither of these conditions are met, we understand that the buffer is under regular operations and the fill level is set based on the difference between the write and read pointers, while its highest bit is set to zero."
