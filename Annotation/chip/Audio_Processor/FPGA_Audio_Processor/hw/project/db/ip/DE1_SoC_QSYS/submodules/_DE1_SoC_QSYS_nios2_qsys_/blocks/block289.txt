The block determines the enabling condition for the "fifo_10_enable". It implements a combination of conditions involving fifo write pointer (fifo_wrptr), input_ge signals as well as ge free signals. `fifo_10_enable` is assigned true when the fifo_wrptr equals 10 and input_ge1 is valid, or when ge2 is free, the next position of the fifo_wrptr is 10 and input_ge2 is valid, or when ge3 is free, two positions next to the fifo_wrptr equals 10 and input_ge3 is valid; otherwise, it is false.
