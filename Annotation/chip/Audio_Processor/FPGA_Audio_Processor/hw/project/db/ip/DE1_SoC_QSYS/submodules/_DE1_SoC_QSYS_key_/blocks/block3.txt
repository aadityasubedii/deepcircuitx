Comment: 
This block is a resettable, clock-enabled, write-strobe controlled flip-flop for capturing edges. The flip-flop is reset asynchronously at the falling edge of 'reset_n'. If not in reset and the clock is enabled ('clk_en'), then at the rising edge of the clock, the value of 'edge_capture[3]' is updated based on 'edge_capture_wr_strobe' and 'edge_detect[3]'. If 'edge_capture_wr_strobe' is high, 'edge_capture[3]' is set to 0, otherwise if 'edge_detect[3]' is high, 'edge_capture[3]' gets a value of -1.
