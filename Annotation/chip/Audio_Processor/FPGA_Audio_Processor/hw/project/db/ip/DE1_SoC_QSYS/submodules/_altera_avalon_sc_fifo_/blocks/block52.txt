The block of code is responsible for updating the current read pointer in a memory structure to the next read pointer. This is accomplished using the 'assign' keyword, which provides a continuous assignment of `next_rd_ptr` to `mem_rd_ptr`, ensuring that `mem_rd_ptr` always reflects the most recent value of `next_rd_ptr`. This operation generally enables efficient reading from the memory by dynamically updating the read pointer.
