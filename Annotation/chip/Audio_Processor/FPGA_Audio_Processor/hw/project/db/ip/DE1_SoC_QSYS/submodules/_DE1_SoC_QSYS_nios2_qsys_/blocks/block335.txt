This block handles the task of controlling a multiplexer's input selection through a switch mechanism. It uses a switch-case statement, where the `compute_input_tm_cnt` variable's value gets updated according to the binary input (`switch_for_mux`). The binary input can take eight different 3-bit variations; for example, '3b000' sets the `compute_input_tm_cnt` to 0, while '3b111' sets it to 3, and so forth for the remaining variations.
