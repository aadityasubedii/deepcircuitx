    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is mainly for assigning a logic operation result to a signal `E_eq`. Specifically, it is essentially assigning the boolean value captured by `E_logic_result_is_0` to the `E_eq` signal. This operation takes place continuously, as indicated by the 'assign' keyword, meaning that whenever there's a change in the `E_logic_result_is_0` value, it will be reflected in `E_eq` instantly."
