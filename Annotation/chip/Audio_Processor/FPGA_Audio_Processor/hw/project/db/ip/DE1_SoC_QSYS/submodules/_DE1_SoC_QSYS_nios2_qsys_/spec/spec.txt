Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys. Module specification: This module implements a Nios II processor core for a System-on-Chip design. It handles instruction fetching, decoding, execution, memory access, and writeback stages of the processor pipeline. Key input ports include clk (system clock), reset_n (active-low reset), d_irq (data interrupt request), d_readdata (data read input), i_readdata (instruction read input), and various JTAG debug module control signals. Output ports include d_address (data memory address), i_address (instruction memory address), d_writedata (data to be written), and debug-related outputs. Internal signals manage pipeline stages (F_, D_, E_, R_, W_ prefixes for Fetch, Decode, Execute, Register, and Writeback), control logic, arithmetic operations
