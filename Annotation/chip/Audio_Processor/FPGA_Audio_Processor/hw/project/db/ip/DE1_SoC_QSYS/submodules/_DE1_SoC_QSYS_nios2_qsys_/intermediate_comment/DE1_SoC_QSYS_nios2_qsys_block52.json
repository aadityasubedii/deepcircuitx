    "block_comment": "The block of code is an assignment operation in Verilog that sets the control signal, `D_ctrl_alu_subtract`, for a subtraction operation in an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). It sets the control signal based on the state of numerous operation codes (opcodes) which specify different machine instructions. When any of the opecodes for subtraction-like operations such as `D_op_sub`, `D_op_cmplti`, or `D_op_cmpge` etc., are invoked, `D_ctrl_alu_subtract` is set high, indicating a subtraction operation should be performed by the ALU."
