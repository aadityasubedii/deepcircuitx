Comment: 
This block is a synchronous counter that resets under certain conditions, forming the key component of a Digital Clock Manager (DCM). On every positive edge of the clock or negative edge of 'reset_n', the block checks if 'reset_n' is 0, if true, the 'counter_snapshot' is set to 0, providing the reset functionality. If 'reset_n' is not 0 and the 'snap_strobe' is active, the 'counter_snapshot' gets the value from 'internal_counter', enabling the counter snapshot feature while the block is functioning.
