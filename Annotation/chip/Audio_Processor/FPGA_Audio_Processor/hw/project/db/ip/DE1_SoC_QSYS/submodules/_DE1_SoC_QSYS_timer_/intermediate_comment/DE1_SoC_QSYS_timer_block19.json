    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling a counter mechanism. The control is performed based on a clock signal, a reset signal, and two control signals (do_start_counter and do_stop_counter). The counter is set to a non-running state immediately when a negative edge is detected on the reset signal. During a positive edge of clock, and if the clock is enabled (clk_en), the counter's state can change: if do_start_counter signal is high, the counter switches over to running state by setting counter_is_running to a high state; if do_stop_counter signal is high, it stops the counter by setting counter_is_running to a low state."
