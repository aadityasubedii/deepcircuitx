    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous digital logic block for controlling reset signals and controlling break events based on several conditions. The block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of `'jrst_n'`. If `'jrst_n'` becomes 0, it resets signals `'break_on_reset'`, `'resetrequest'`, and `'jtag_break'`. However, if signal `'take_action_ocimem_a'` is active, it reconfigures `'resetrequest'`, `'jtag_break'` and `'break_on_reset'` using bits from the `'jdo'` signal, and possibly resets `'resetlatch'`. If the `'reset_sync'` signal is set, it updates `'jtag_break'` and sets `'resetlatch'` to 1. Lastly, if `'debugreq'` is active and `'debugack'` is inactive and `'break_on_reset'` is high, it sets `'jtag_break'` signal to 1."
