    "block_comment": "This Verilog block has a conditional module generator which creates logic if the `USE_STORE_FORWARD` macro is defined. This is accomplished by using the `generate if` construct, which acts as a compile-time `if` branch, creating specific logic only if the condition in the parentheses is true. The assigned logic in this block limits the size of a FIFO queue to `FIFO_DEPTH - 1`, enforcing a maximum size by adjusting a configurable parameter."
