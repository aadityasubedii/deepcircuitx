Its core functionality stems from the large memory array `mem_array` that simulates the functionality of an SDRAM. Read (`q = mem_array[read_address];`) and write operations (`mem_array[wraddress] <= data;`) can be carried out with the help of various input ports such as data, rdaddress, rdclken, wraddress, wrclock, wren, and output port q.

The module uses input signals like clk, zs_addr, zs_ba, zs_cas_n, zs_cke, zs_cs_n, zs_dqm, zs_ras_n, zs_we_n and output signal zs_dq to control the operations. Moreover, it features a series of internal signals such as CODE, a, addr_col, addr_crb, ba, cas_n, cke, cmd_code, cs_n, dqm, index, latency, mask, mem_bytes, ras_n, rd_addr_pipe_0, rd_addr_pipe_1, rd_addr_pipe_2, rd_mask_pipe_0, rd_mask_pipe_1, rd_mask_pipe_2, rd_valid_pipe, read_addr, read_data, read_mask, read_temp, read_valid, rmw_temp, test_addr, txt_code, we_n which help implementing diverse functionalities like data masking, command code translation, latency management, and addressing. It includes an instance of 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module' to simulate actual memory operations synchronized with the system clock (`clk`)."
