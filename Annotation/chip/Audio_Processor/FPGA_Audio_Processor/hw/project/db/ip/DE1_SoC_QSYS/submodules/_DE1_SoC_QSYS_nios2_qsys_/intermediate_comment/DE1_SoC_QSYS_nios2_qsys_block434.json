    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code assigns a default value of 0 to the signal `xbrk3_tout_hit`. This essentially initializes the signal `xbrk3_tout_hit` to a low logic level, or 'off' state. The `assign` statement at the declarative level indicates that this value is assigned to the signal when the Verilog module is loaded or reset. This is a combinatorial assignment and the right-hand side could be more complex, involving other signals and logic operations, but in this case, it simply initializes the signal to 0."
