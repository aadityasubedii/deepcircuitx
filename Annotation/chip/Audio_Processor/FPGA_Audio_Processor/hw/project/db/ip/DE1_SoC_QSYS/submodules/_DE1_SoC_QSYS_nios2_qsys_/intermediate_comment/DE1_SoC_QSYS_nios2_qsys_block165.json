    "block_comment": "This block of code is utilized for generating the next state of the `av_ld_waiting_for_data` signal. Within this conditional assignment implementation, if the `av_ld_waiting_for_data` signal is high (true), the next state will be the inverse of `av_ld_getting_data`. If `av_ld_waiting_for_data` is low (false), the next state will be determined by the bitwise AND operation between `R_ctrl_ld` and `E_new_inst` signals."
