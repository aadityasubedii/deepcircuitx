    "block_comment": "The block implements a conditional statement that verifies if the system requires a reset or if the reset request from the adaptive unit is pending. The reset request can be made either internally or by an adaptive unit. The conditions to verify are whether no internal or adaptive reset request is made, or an adaptive reset request is made and the output reset synchronisation edges aren't in a deasserted state. If these conditions are fulfilled, the model proceeds to the following implementation within this block."
