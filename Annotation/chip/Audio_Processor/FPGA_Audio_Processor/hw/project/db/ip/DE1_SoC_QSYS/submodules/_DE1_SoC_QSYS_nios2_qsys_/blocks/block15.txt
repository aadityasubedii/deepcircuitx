Comment: 
This line of Verilog code assigns the next state of the Read Control Instruction (R_ctrl_rdctl_inst_nxt) to the current value or state (D_ctrl_rdctl_inst). The assignment statement is used, denoted by the keyword 'assign', to achieve non-blocking assignment, ensuring that the value of D_ctrl_rdctl_inst is continuously driven to R_ctrl_rdctl_inst_nxt, maintaining flow and stability in the design. The state transition operation is effectuated without any need for an explicit triggering event such as a clock edge, providing continuous evaluation in hardware.
