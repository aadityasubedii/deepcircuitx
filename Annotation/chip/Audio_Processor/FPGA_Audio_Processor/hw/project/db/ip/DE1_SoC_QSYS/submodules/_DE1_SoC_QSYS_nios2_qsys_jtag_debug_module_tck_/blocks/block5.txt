Comment: 
The block sets a parameter for an instance called 'the_altera_std_synchronizer1'. The implementation uses a 'defparam' directive, which allows to configure parameters of previously defined instances or modules. In this case, the block sets the 'depth' parameter of 'the_altera_std_synchronizer1' to 2, possibly configuring it to be a 2-stage synchronizer, which typically helps to reduce metastability issues when signals cross clock domains.
