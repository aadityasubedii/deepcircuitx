    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a synchronous circuit which is primarily responsible for managing and updating the state of a FIFO register (fifo_15). This functionality is achieved through the use of clock edge sensitivity and conditional checks tied to the system's reset and an enable signal specifically for fifo_15. On a negative-edge of the system reset (i.e., when 'reset_n' is equal to zero), the fifo_15 register is reset to zero. On a positive edge of the system clock, if the 'fifo_15_enable' signal is high, the contents of the fifo_15 register are updated based on the output of a multiplexer (fifo_15_mux)."
