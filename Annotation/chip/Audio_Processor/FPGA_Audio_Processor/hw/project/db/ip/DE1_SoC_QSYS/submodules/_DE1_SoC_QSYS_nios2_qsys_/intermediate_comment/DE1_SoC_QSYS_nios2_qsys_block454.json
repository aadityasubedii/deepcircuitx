    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a constant value of 0 to the wire 'xbrk0_ton_hit'. The function of the code is to reset or initialise 'xbrk0_ton_hit' to 0 at every time step in the program's execution, essentially making 'xbrk0_ton_hit' a constant wire throughout the Verilog design. There are no logic operations or connections to other blocks or wires involved in this assignment, which simplifies the execution process.\n"
