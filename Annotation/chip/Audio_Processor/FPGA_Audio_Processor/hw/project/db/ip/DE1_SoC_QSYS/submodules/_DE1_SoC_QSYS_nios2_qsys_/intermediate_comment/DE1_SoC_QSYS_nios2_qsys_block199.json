    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is assigning a value to the variable 'E_arith_src1' in a concurrent manner. The arithmetic operation being performed here combines bit-wise XOR operation and bit selection. Specifically, the most significant bit (bit 31) of 'E_src1' is XOR'ed with the 'E_invert_arith_src_msb' value. The result of this operation is then concatenated with the lower 31 bits (bits 30 to 0) of 'E_src1'. The combination of these operations may be used for sign extension or bit inversion purposes depending on the context of 'E_invert_arith_src_msb'."
