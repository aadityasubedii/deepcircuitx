    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the enable signal of an 8-bit FIFO structure. It employs a few conditional formulae to dictate when the `fifo_8_enable` signal will be high. The conditions involve checking if the write pointer is at position 8 and there is at least one input (`input_ge1`), or if there are two free positions (`ge2_free`) and the write pointer incremented by one equals 8 with at least two inputs (`input_ge2`), or if there are three free positions (`ge3_free`) and the write pointer incremented by two equals 8 with at least three inputs (`input_ge3`). This design aims to only allow the FIFO to be enabled when there is a suitable amount of data to be written and sufficient space to hold it."
