    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing the enable status of the debug halt on break (hbreak_enabled) in sync with the clock. The block is essentially a flip-flop that gets updated on the positive edge of the clock or on the negative edge of the asynchronous reset signal (reset_n). If the system is being reset, hbreak_enabled will be set to high (logic '1') immediately. In between clock cycles, if the E_valid signal is asserted, hbreak_enabled will either be disabled if a debug break condition in the control register (R_ctrl_break) is detected, or will be enabled if a break return operation (D_op_bret) has to be followed, otherwise it retains its previous state."
