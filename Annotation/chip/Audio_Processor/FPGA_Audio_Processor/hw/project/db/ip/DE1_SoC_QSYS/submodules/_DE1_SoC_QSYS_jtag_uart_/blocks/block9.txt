Comment: 
The block controls the status of receiver and transmitter in a digital communication system. Upon negative edge of reset (indicating a reset occurs), it clears the receiver valid flag (`r_val`) and sets data available for transmitter flag (`t_dav`). When there's a positive clock edge without a reset, it sets `r_val` based on if receiver is enabled and write FIFO is not empty, indicating data is valid on the receiver side. Simultaneously, it sets `t_dav` to show data can be inputted to the FIFO if it's not full.
