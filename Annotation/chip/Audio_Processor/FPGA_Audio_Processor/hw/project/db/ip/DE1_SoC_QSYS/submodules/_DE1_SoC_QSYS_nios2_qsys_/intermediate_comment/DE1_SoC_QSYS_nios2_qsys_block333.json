    "block_comment": "This block of code performs control of FIFO (First In, First Out) count increment based on various conditional inputs. It operates by initially waiting for changes to any one of 'empty', 'ge2_free', 'ge3_free', or 'input_tm_cnt' signals. If FIFO is 'empty', then the increment is set by the least significant two bits of 'input_tm_cnt'. Otherwise, the increment depends on whether 'ge2_free' or 'ge3_free' is true and if 'input_tm_cnt' meets specific conditions. As a final resort, the increment is set to a 5-bit wide binary value of all ones if none of the other conditions are met."
