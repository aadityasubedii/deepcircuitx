Comment: 
This block of code handles a synchronous reset and an internal initialization state for a digital system. It uses a positive edge clock signal or a negative edge reset signal to initiate internal state modification. When the reset signal goes low, it sets the 'init_done' signal to 0, effectively resetting and halting system initialization. Additionally, when a high signal is constantly present, it sets 'init_done' to a logical OR function of its current state and the equality check between 'i_state' and binary '101', thus only updating 'init_done' if 'i_state' equals binary '101' and leaving it unperturbed otherwise.
