    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is responsible for handling the control flag for direct jumps in a digital logic circuit. When the reset flag is triggered (active low), the code sets the direct jump control ('R_ctrl_jmp_direct') to zero, effectively resetting it. In the event of a clock pulse (edge), provided the enable signal ('R_en') is high, 'R_ctrl_jmp_direct' captures the next state ('R_ctrl_jmp_direct_nxt'), hence providing a method to update the control flag. This code is implemented using a standard sequential logic block that responds to the positive edges of the system clock and negative edges of the reset signal."
