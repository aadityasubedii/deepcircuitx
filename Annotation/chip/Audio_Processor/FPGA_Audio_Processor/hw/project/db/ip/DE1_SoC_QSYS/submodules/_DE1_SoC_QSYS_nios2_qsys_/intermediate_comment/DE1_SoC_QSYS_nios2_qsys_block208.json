    "block_comment": "The block assigns a specific 16-bit value to the `R_src2_hi` variable based on several condition checks. It utilizes Verilog's conditional (ternary) operator to decide the value of `R_src2_hi`. If control signals `R_ctrl_force_src2_zero` or `R_ctrl_unsigned_lo_imm16` are high, it assigns the value zero. Whereas, if `R_ctrl_hi_imm16` is high, it takes the 16-bit immediate value from instruction word. If the control signal `R_src2_use_imm` is active, then it extends the sign of the 16-bit immediate value from the instruction word. Otherwise, the block assigns the high half of the 32-bit value from the `R_rf_b` register."
