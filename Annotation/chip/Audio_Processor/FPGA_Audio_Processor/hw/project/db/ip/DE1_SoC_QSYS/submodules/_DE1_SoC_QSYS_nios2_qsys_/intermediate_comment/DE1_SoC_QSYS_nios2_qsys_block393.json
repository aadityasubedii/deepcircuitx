    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a fixed low signal (0) to the variable 'dbrk1_trigout'. This is achieved through the use of the 'assign' keyword in Verilog which is used here to link the constant value 1'b0 (binary value for 0 in Verilog) to the variable 'dbrk1_trigout', effectively ensuring that 'dbrk1_trigout' remains low at all times in the contextual simulation/system."
