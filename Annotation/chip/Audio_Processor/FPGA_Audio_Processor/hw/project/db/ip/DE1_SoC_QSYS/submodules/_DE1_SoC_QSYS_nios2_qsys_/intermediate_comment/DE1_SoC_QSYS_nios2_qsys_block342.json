    "block_comment": "This block of code is a multiplexer (mux) that assigns different binary values to the variable `td_mode` based on the value of the variable `ctrl_bits_for_mux`. The mux is designed using the Verilog `case` statement, where `ctrl_bits_for_mux` are the selector bits. A different binary value (ranging from 4'b0000 to 4'b1111) is assigned to `td_mode` for each possible 3-bit combination of `ctrl_bits_for_mux` (from 3'b000 to 3'b111). The code is always sensitive to changes in `ctrl_bits_for_mux`."
