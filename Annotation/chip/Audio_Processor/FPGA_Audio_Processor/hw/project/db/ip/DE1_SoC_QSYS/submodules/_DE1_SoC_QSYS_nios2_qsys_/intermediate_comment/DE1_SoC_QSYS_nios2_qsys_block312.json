    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a synchronous reset and conditional update functionality for a signal called \"fifo_2\". The logic block is sensitive to both the positive edge of the clock signal and the negative edge of the \"reset_n\" signal. Upon a negative edge trigger on \"reset_n\", \"fifo_2\" is reset to 0. During the positive edge of the clock, if the \"fifo_2_enable\" signal is set (high), \"fifo_2\" is updated with the value of \"fifo_2_mux\"."
