    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a flip-flop with asynchronous reset. It updates the state of 'd_write' every positive edge of clock signal 'clk' or during the negative edge of 'reset_n'. If 'reset_n' is 0, 'd_write' is compulsorily set to 0 (indicating a reset), otherwise on every positive clock edge, 'd_write' will be updated to the value of 'd_write_nxt', effectively allowing 'd_write' to hold its state."
