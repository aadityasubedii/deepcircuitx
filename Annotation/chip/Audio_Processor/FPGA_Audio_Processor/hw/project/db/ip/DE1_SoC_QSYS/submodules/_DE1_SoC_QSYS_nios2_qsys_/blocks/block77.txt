Comment: 
This block of code controls the operation of an arithmetic right shift register. On the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of a negative reset signal, it checks if the reset signal is active (0), and if so, it clears the arithmetic right shift register. Otherwise, if the enable signal is high, the next value for the shift register is loaded from the `R_ctrl_shift_right_arith_nxt` signal.
