The block performs control state movement for a digital circuit. It reacts to the positive edge of the clock or negative edge of reset signal. If a reset signal is triggered (i.e., reset_n equals 0), the block resets the control state (R_ctrl_st) to 0. Otherwise, during a positive clock edge, if the enable signal (R_en) is high, the control state will advance to its next state (R_ctrl_st_nxt).
