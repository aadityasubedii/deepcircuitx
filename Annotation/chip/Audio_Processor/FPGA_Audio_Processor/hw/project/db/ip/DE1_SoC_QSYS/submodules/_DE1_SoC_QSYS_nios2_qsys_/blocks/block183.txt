Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used to assign control read data (`E_control_rd_data`) based on the control register number (`D_iw_control_regnum`). The assignment uses a conditionally ternary operator to match the control register number to a corresponding status or configuration register, which can be one of `W_status_reg`, `W_estatus_reg`, `W_bstatus_reg`, `W_ienable_reg`, `W_ipending_reg` and `W_cpuid_reg`. The use of a conditional operator here simplifies maintaining and understanding the code since otherwise multiple if-else statements would be required to achieve the same functionality.
