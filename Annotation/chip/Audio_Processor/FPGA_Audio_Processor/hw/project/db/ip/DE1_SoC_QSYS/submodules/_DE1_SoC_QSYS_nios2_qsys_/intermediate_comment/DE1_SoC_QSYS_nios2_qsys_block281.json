    "block_comment": "This block controls the multiplexer for a 12th entry in a FIFO buffer. The mux selection depends on various conditions such as the write pointer location, validity of certain input signals, and availability of free entries in the FIFO. If the write pointer points to the 12th location and `itm_valid`, `atm_valid`, or `dtm_valid` signals are true, the mux selects `itm`, `overflow_pending_atm`, or `overflow_pending_dtm`, respectively. In case the next location points to the 12th entry and `ge2_free` and validity signals are true, the mux selects between `overflow_pending_atm` or `overflow_pending_dtm`. If none of these conditions are met, `overflow_pending_dtm` is selected by default."
