Comment: 
This block of Verilog code implements a synchronous register for the status of 'W' estimation with a negative level triggered reset. During the rising edge of the clock signal, the status register 'W_estatus_reg' gets updated. Data synchronization happens based on 'clk' (a clock signal) and 'reset_n' (an active low reset signal). Upon the arrival of a negative edge of the signal 'reset_n', 'W_estatus_reg' will be reset to ‘0’. Otherwise, if the reset signal is not asserted, the register will be loaded with the value of 'W_estatus_reg_nxt' at the next rising edge of the clock signal.
