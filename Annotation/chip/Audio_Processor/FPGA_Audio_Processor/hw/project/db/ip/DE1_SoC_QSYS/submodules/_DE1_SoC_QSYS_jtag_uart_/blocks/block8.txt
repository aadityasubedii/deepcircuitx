This block of code is responsible for the operation of a FIFO (First In, First Out) memory buffer. The system responds to either a positive clock edge, signifying data is ready to process, or a negative reset signal. If a reset is initiated, all registers are reset to default values, mainly zero, indicating an empty FIFO. In the absence of reset, the block examines multiple conditions relating to buffer states and control flags. Where the control signals allow, data is written and read to and from the FIFO. This is controlled via a nested sequence of if-statements, governing not just FIFO usage, but also handling possible buffer underflow or overflow conditions, and managing wait-request signals to synchronize data flow with external components.
