Comment: 
This block of code designs a synchronous D-type flip-flop with asynchronous reset. Upon the negative edge of reset_n signal, the flip-flop is immediately reset, driving its output d_read to 0. On the positive edge of the clock signal clk, the flip-flop captures and holds the value of d_read_nxt at its output d_read.
