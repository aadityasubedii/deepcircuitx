    "block_comment": "The block of code handles exceptions when a wrong parameter is passed to a generated module instantiation in Verilog. The block is an initial block, meant to execute once during a simulation. When wrong parameters are passed, it uses the `$display` system task to output a message declaring the issue, and then triggers the `$stop` system task to terminate the simulation, preventing further operation or potential damage."
