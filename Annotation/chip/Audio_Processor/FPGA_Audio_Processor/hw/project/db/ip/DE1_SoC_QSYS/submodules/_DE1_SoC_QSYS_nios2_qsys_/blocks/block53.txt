Comment: 
This block manages the control branch register (`R_ctrl_br`) based on the system's clock signal (`clk`) and the active-low reset signal (`reset_n`). It either resets the register or updates its value on the positive clock edge. For a negative edge of `reset_n`, the register `R_ctrl_br` is reset to zero regardless of any other conditions. Conversely, on the positive edge of the `clk` signal, when `R_en` is enabled, the register `R_ctrl_br` is updated with the next control branch value, `R_ctrl_br_nxt`.
