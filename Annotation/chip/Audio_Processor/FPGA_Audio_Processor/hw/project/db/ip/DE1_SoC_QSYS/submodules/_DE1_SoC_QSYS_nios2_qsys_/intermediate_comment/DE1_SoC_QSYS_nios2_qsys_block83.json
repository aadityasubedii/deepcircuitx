    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a synchronous hardware circuit for a control register named `R_ctrl_retaddr`. On the negative edge of the reset signal `reset_n`, it resets the `R_ctrl_retaddr` register to 0. On the positive edge of the clock `clk` signal and if the enable `R_en` is true, it updates the `R_ctrl_retaddr` to the value of `R_ctrl_retaddr_nxt`. This ensures the state of `R_ctrl_retaddr` is maintained or updated every clock cycle based on `reset_n` and `R_en` conditions."
