Comment: 
The block manages the activation of the FIFO 5. Functionality is achieved by evaluating certain conditions -- specifically, the block checks whether the write pointer of the FIFO (fifo_wrptr) is at position 5 and if there's at least one input (input_ge1), or whether there's availability in GE2 (ge2_free) with the write pointer at the next position and at least two inputs (input_ge2), or finally if there's availability in GE3 (ge3_free) with the write pointer two positions ahead and at least three inputs (input_ge3). If any conditions are met, fifo_5_enable is activated.
