    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns data to 'dbrk_data', a design trace variable. It uses a ternary operator to make the selection between two types of data: the 'cpu_d_writedata', which is the data written by the CPU, and 'cpu_d_readdata', which is the data read by the CPU. The choice between the two is decided based on the 'cpu_d_write' control signal. If 'cpu_d_write' is True, then 'dbrk_data' is assigned 'cpu_d_writedata', otherwise, it takes the value of 'cpu_d_readdata'. This code segment is likely part of a larger data processing block which uses 'dbrk_data' for complex logic operations."
