Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is responsible for the assignment of a constant value to a variable. In this specific case, it assigns the value '0' to the variable 'curr_pid'. The 'assign' statement is used here for continuous assignment, which means that the RHS expression's value is continuously evaluated and assigned to the LHS variable. The '1'b0' is a Verilog syntax representing a single-bit binary value of '0'.
