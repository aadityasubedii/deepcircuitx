    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns a constant low value (0 logic) to the variable 'dbrk3_low_value'. This means that 'dbrk3_low_value' is always driving '0' irrespective of any other logical condition or input in the entire Verilog design. This is done using the 'assign' keyword which is used for continuous assignment statements in Verilog, creating a wire-type object and assigning a value to it."
