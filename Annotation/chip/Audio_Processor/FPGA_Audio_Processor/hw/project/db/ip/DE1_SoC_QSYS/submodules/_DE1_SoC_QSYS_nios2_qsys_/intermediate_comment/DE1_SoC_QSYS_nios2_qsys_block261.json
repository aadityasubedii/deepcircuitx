    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the wire `tw` to `trc_im_data`. Specifically, whenever the value of `tw` changes, the new value is immediately assigned to `trc_im_data` as well. This is an instance of continuous assignment in Verilog, often used to connect module blocks, to perform Boolean logic, or simply to assign a net within another wire's value."
