Comment: 
The block of code increases a FIFO write pointer based on the availability status of elements and the current count of a time-multiplexing input. The code block does this by systematically checking specific conditions of ge3_free (element 3 availability), ge2_free (element 2 availability), and input_tm_cnt (input time multiplexing count). An increment is then assigned according to the result of the condition checks, prioritizing a greater increment if higher element availability is confirmed and the input count is adequate.
