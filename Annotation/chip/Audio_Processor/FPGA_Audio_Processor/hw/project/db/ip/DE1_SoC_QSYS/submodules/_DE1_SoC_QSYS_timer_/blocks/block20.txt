Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for the control signals to start and stop a counter. The counter starts when 'start_strobe' is asserted. Stopping the counter occurs under any one of three conditions: an explicit 'stop_strobe' signal, if 'force_reload' is activated, or if the counter hits zero in non-continuous mode (`counter_is_zero` is true and `control_continuous` is false).
