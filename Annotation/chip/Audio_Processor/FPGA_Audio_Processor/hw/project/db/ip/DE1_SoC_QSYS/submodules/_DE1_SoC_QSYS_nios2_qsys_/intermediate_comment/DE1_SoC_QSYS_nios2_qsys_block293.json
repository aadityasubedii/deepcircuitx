    "block_comment": "This block handles multiplexing within a FIFO buffer based on various data valid signals. It assigns fifo_8_mux according to the availability of itm, atm and dtm data, when the write pointer (fifo_wrptr or fifo_wrptr_plus1) is '8. Implementing priority with itm having highest priority, and dtm, the least. The mux allocation favors data validation that happens earlier and ensures overflow management with ge2_free signal. Overflow_pending data is considered according to the valid input and fifo write pointer status."
