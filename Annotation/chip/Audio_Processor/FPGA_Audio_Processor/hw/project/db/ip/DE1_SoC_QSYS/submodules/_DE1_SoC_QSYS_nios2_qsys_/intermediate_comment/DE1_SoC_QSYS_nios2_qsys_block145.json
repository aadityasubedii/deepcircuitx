    "block_comment": "This block implements a synchronous reset functionality for the control read data variable (W_control_rd_data). The system is triggered by a positive edge of the clock signal or a negative edge of the reset_n signal. If the reset_n signal is LOW (0), it immediately resets W_control_rd_data to 0. Otherwise, during the positive clock edge, W_control_rd_data takes on the value of E_control_rd_data."
