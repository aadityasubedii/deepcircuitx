This block of code is used for managing a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer, specifically fifo_13. When a negative edge of a reset signal (reset_n) occurs, the fifo_13 gets reset to zero. In a positive edge of the clock signal (clk), if the enable signal for fifo_13 (fifo_13_enable) is true, the value of fifo_13 gets updated with the value on the fifo_13_mux. This implementation allows this logic block to behave like a FIFO buffer where data can be written (on fifo_13_mux line) when enabled, and read from fifo_13, in sync with the clock signal.
