Comment: 
The block of code is designed to manage a circular buffer memory, indicating which memory location is used. The design is synchronous, reacting to the rising edge of 'clk' or 'reset'. When reset is true, the memory location 'i' is set to unused. Otherwise, it checks if 'write' and 'read' are not happening simultaneously. If 'write' is true, it sets the current memory state to the previous state. Conversely, if 'read' is true, it sets the current state to the next state.
