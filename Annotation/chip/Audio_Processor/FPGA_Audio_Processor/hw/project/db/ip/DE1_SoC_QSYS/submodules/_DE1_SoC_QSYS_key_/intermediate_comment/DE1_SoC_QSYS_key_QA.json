It monitors input from a button or interrupt source (input \"in_port\"), performs edge detection on the input, and sets an interrupt (\"irq\") when an edge (button press/release or interrupt) is detected and not yet cleared (via \"edge_capture\"). It communicates with an external device or CPU via address and data buses (\"address\" and \"readdata/writedata\"). Control signals for the communication include \"clk\" (clock), \"reset_n\" (active-low reset), \"chipselect\" (to select this module among possibly others), and \"write_n\" (active-low write signal). The \"irq_mask\" determines whether an interrupt request will be issued when the specific edge (button press/release) is detected. This module is likely a part of a larger design, implemented on an FPGA. Its main purpose is to handle interrupt inputs/outputs and perform necessary operations according to the input, including edge detection and interrupt mask."

If set to 0, it resets the relevant internal state of the module.\n6. write_n: This is an active low write signal. If set to 0, it indicates a write operation to this hardware.\n7. writedata: This is the data which is to be written to this hardware.\n\nOutput ports:\n\n1. irq: This is the interrupt request output. It is set if the interrupt request needs to be made to the external device or the CPU.\n2. readdata: This is the output data port. This is the data that is read from the hardware/module and sent to the external device or the CPU.\n\nExplanation: These input and output ports together allow this module to be used as an external interrupt controller for detecting certain edge cases as defined by `in_port` and setting an interrupt (as denoted by `irq`). The read/write operations take place based on the clock and the inputs `address`, `chipselect`, `write_n`, and `writedata`. The state of the module is reset based on the active low `reset_n` signal."

In this module, it has been permanently set to 1.\n\n2. d1_data_in, d2_data_in: These signals are registered versions of 'data_in' delayed by one and two clock cycles, respectively.
