    "block_comment": "The block is a synchronous reset control structure for a device in the design. Upon receiving a positive edge of the clock signal, the block checks if the last bit of synchronization chain (altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain[MIN_METASTABLE-1]) is high. If it is, it asserts the reset signal for the chain by setting all bits of register r_sync_rst_chain as logic one. If the chain bit is not high, the block propagates the reset signal through the register chain by shifting the bits of r_sync_rst_chain to the right and introducing a logic zero at the leftwards-most position."
