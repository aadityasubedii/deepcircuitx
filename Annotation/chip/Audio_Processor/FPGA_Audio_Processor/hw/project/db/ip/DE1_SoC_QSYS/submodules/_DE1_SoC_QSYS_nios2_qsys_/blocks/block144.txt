The block of code is a synchronous sequential logic block that updates the value of "W_cmp_result" register. This is triggered on either a positive edge of the clock signal or a negative edge of the "reset_n" signal. During a reset condition (when "reset_n" value is 0), "W_cmp_result" is set to 0 and when not in a reset condition, it is updated with the value from the "E_cmp_result".
