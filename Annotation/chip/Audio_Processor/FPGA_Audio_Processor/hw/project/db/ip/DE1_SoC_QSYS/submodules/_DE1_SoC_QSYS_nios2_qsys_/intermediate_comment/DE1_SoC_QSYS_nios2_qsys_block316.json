    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the enable signal of fifo_1 element in a hardware design. The enable signal is activated if either of three conditions is satisfied: 1) the write pointer fifo_wrptr equals 1 and there is at least one input in the fifo, 2) at least two input signals are available and the next write pointer position equals 1 with sufficient free space for two inputs, or 3) at least three input signals are available and the second next write pointer position equals 1 with enough free space for three inputs. This ensures the fifo_1 is efficiently utilized and avoid overflow."
