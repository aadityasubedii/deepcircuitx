Comment: 
This block primarily handles the conditions when it's okay to forward data or drop it based on errors. On entering this else path (`gen_blk20_else`), the block assigns `ok_to_forward` and `drop_on_error` indicating that it's safe to move data forward and not necessary to drop it due to errors. If the Address Width (`ADDR_WIDTH`) is less than or equals to 1, it assigns `curr_sop_ptr` as 0, else it assigns a value of `ADDR_WIDTH - 1` bits of 0 to `curr_sop_ptr`. This manages the pointer to the Start of Packet (SOP) based on the address width.
