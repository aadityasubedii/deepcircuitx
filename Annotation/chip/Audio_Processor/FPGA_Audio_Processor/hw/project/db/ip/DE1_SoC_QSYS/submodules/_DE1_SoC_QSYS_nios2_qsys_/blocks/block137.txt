Comment: 
This line of code assigns the `W_cpuid_reg` register to a constant value of zero. The use of the `assign` keyword in Verilog indicates that this is a continuous assignment statement, which establishes a drive value for the `W_cpuid_reg` register based on some expression on the right-hand-side of the equation. In this case, the expression is simply a constant zero, so the register will always have a value of zero. This might be used to reset or initialize the register to a known state.
