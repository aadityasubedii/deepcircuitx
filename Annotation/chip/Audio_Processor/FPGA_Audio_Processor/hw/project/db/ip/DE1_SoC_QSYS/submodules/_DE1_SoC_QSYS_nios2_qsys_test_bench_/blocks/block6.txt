This block of code is a standard clocked digital circuit behavior using always constructs. It operates on rising edges of 'clk' signal. On each positive 'clk' transition, it checks if 'reset_n' is active and 'd_read' signal has an unknown value '1'bx' (where 'x' is unknown or don't care). If these conditions meet, it throws an error message with a timestamp and stops the execution.
