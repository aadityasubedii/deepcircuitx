    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous reset edge detection and capture module for a digital electronic system. The block listens to the rising edge of the clock signal and the falling edge of the reset signal. On reset (when reset_n is 0), it sets the first bit of the edge_capture array to 0. If reset is not engaged and when clock enable (clk_en) is high, it further checks if the write strobe for edge capture (edge_capture_wr_strobe) is high, if so, it resets edge_capture[0] to 0, otherwise, if the first element in the edge_detect array is high, it sets edge_capture[0] to -1."
