    "block_comment": "This block assigns the `not_in_debug_mode` wire a value of 0 in the digital design. This is achieved through the use of the Verilog `assign` keyword, which perpetually assigns a value of zero(b0) to the `not_in_debug_mode` wire until any modifications are made. Therefore, in this implementation, the digital system is always in debug mode as inferred from the given RTL statement `assign not_in_debug_mode = 1'b0;`."
