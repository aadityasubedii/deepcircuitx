Comment: 
This block of code describes a synchronous digital system that updates its internal state on the rising edge of a clock signal or a reset signal. The system consists of two variables, data1 and full1, which are reset to zero when a reset signal is present. If a reset signal is not present and the system is ready to receive data (as indicated by the in_ready signal), the internal state variables data1 and full1 will be updated to the values of in_data and in_valid, respectively.
