    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a logical OR operation on four signals: xbrk0_toff_hit, xbrk1_toff_hit, xbrk2_toff_hit, and xbrk3_toff_hit. It then assigns the result of this operation to the signal xbrk_toff_hit. This design allows the signal xbrk_toff_hit to activate if any of the xbrkN_toff_hit signals becomes true, providing a cumulative indicator for different break conditions."
