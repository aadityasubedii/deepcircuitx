    "block_comment": "This block of code selects the address for the on-chip RAM (ociram_addr) based on a condition. If jtag_ram_access signal is high, it uses the 2nd to 9th bits from MonAReg as the ociram_addr. Otherwise, if jtag_ram_access signal is low, it uses the lower 8 bits from the 'address' as the ociram_addr. This conditional assignment allows the mechanism for either normal operation (addressing using 'address') or debug mode (addressing using 'MonAReg') in the system."
