Comment: 
This block of code defines a flip-flop that is used to update the `hbreak_pending` signal. On the negative edge of the `reset_n` signal, or each positive edge of the clock `clk`, the `hbreak_pending` is updated. Specifically, if `reset_n` equals to 0, `hbreak_pending` is forced to be '0'. Otherwise, on the active clock edge, the `hbreak_pending` will take the value of `hbreak_pending_nxt`.
