Comment: 
This block assigns signals to output variables. The 'always @*' construct responds to any changes on its sensitivity list - in this case, all variables within the block. It propagates the internal signals 'internal_out_valid' and 'internal_out_payload' respectively to the output signals 'out_valid' and 'out_payload'.
