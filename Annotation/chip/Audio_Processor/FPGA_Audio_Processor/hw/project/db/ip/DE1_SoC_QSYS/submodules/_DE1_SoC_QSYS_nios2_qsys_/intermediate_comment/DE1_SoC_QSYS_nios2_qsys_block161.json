    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is responsible for defining the next state of av_ld_byte0_data_nxt by performing conditional operations based on av_ld_rshift8 and av_ld_extend. If av_ld_rshift8 is true, the current value in av_ld_byte1_data is assigned, whereas if av_ld_extend is true, the current value in av_ld_byte0_data is assigned. If both are false, only the least significant byte of d_readdata is assigned to av_ld_byte0_data_nxt."
