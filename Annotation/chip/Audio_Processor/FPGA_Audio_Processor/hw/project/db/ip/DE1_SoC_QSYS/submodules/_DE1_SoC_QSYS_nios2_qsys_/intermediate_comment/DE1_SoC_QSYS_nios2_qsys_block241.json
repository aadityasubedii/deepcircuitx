    "block_comment": "This block of code is defining the behavior of a Program Counter (PC) using always block in Verilog. The Program Counter updates at every positive edge of the clock or at negative edge when reset_n is low. If reset_n is 0, then the Program Counter is initialized to the value \"16809984\". Otherwise, if the enable signal F_pc_en is high, the Program Counter is updated with the value of F_pc_nxt at the next positive edge clock cycle."
