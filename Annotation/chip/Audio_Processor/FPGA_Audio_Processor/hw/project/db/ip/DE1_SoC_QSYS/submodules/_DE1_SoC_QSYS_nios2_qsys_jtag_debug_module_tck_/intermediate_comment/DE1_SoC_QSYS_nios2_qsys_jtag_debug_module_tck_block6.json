    "block_comment": "The block serves as a standard synchronizer, specifically the 'altera_std_synchronizer'. It implements synchronization across different clock domains. The input 'debugack' signal is synchronized to the 'tck' clock signal. The synchronized output is then received at 'debugack_sync'. It also provides functionality for asynchronous reset, which is activated by the 'unxcomplemented_resetxx1' signal."
