    "block_comment": "This code block performs an assignment operation in Verilog. It addresses the task of continuously assigning the value of the `trc_wrap` wire to the `tracemem_tw` wire. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used to model both combinational and sequential logic, by default it models combinational logic, which means that the output is driven by the current inputs."
