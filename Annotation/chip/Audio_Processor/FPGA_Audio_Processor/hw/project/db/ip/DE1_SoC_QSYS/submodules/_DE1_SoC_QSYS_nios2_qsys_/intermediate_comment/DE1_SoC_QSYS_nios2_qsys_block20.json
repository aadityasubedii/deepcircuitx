    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential logic circuit, more precisely a flip-flop, with a synchronous reset functionality. The flip-flop captures and holds `R_ctrl_src2_choose_imm_nxt` signal whenever there is a positive edge in the `clk` signal, and `R_en` is enabled. In circumstances where the `reset_n` signal drops low, it forces the output `R_ctrl_src2_choose_imm` to reset to 0, independent of the clock cycle. The assignment operation of capturing and assigning the next state `R_ctrl_src2_choose_imm_nxt` takes place in the non-reset branch of the if-else, indicating it is a clocked synchronous operation, which only happens on the positive edge of `clk`.\n"
