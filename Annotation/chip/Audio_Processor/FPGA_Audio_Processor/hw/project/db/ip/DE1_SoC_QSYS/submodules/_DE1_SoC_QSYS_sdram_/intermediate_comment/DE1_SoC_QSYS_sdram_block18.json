    "block_comment": "This block manages the read and write operations for a two-input system. It utilizes a clock signal and a reset signal, which when active, resets the write and read address to zero. On the active edge of the clock, if the system isn't reset, it evaluates the 'rdwr' case statement to determine operation. If 'rdwr' equals 1, it checks if the system isn't full before incrementing the 'entries' and the write address (wrapping around to 0 if it's already 1). Should 'rdwr' equals 2, it checks if the system isn't empty, then decrements 'entries' and increments the read address (wrapping around if it's already 1). If 'rdwr' equals 3, both write and read address increment, regardless of 'full' or 'empty' status."
