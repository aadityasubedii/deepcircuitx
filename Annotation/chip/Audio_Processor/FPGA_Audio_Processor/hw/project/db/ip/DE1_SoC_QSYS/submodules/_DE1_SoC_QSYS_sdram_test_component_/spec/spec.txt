Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module and DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component.

Module specification: 

The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module, as the name suggests, acts as a component in a larger system design meant to mimic the actions of an SDRAM module for the DE1-SoC FPGA board QSYS system. Its core functionality stems from the large memory array `mem_array` that simulates the functionality of an SDRAM. Read (`q = mem_array[read_address];`) and write operations (`mem_array[wraddress] <= data;`) can be carried out with the help of various input ports such as data, rdaddress, rdclken, wraddress, wrclock, wren, and output port q. The module is initialized with contents from the "DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component.dat" file.

The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component module is a higher-layer testbench controller that manages manipulation of signals to perform various operations on the SDRAM module. The module uses input signals like clk, zs_addr, zs_ba, zs_cas_n, zs_cke, zs_cs_n, zs_dqm, zs_ras_n, zs_we_n and output signal zs_dq to control the operations. Moreover, it features a series of internal signals such as CODE, a, addr_col, addr_crb, ba, cas_n, cke, cmd_code, cs_n, dqm, index, latency, mask, mem_bytes, ras_n, rd_addr_pipe_0, rd_addr_pipe_1, rd_addr_pipe_2, rd_mask_pipe_0, rd_mask_pipe_1, rd_mask_pipe_2, rd_valid_pipe, read_addr, read_data, read_mask, read_temp, read_valid, rmw_temp, test_addr, txt_code, we_n which help implementing diverse functionalities like data masking, command code translation, latency management, and addressing. It includes an instance of 'DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module' to simulate actual memory operations synchronized with the system clock (`clk`).
