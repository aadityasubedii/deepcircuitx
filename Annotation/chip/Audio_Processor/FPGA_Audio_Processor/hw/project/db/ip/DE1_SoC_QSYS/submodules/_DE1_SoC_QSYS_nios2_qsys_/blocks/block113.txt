This block of code is responsible for handling reset and clock edge control logic of a certain register `R_ctrl_custom`. It uses a synchronous reset scheme, which is triggered by the negative edge of `reset_n` signal. When `reset_n` is low, the register `R_ctrl_custom` resets to zero. Otherwise, on a positive clock edge, if the register enable signal `R_en` is high, the `R_ctrl_custom` will be updated with the value of `R_ctrl_custom_nxt`.
