    "block_comment": "The function of the block is to handle the \"byteenable\" register updates based on the \"jrst_n\" input and \"clk\" clock signal. The register gets updated at every rising edge of the clock or falling edge of the \"jrst_n\" input. If the \"jrst_n\" signal is '0', the \"byteenable\" register is immediately reset to '0'. Otherwise, the \"byteenable\" register gets updated with the value of \"byteenable_nxt\"."
