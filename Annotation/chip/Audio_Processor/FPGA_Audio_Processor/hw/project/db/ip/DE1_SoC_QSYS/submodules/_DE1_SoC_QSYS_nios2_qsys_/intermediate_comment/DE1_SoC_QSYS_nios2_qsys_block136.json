    "block_comment": "This block conditionally assigns values to the 'W_wr_data_non_zero' register. If 'R_ctrl_br_cmp' is true, 'W_wr_data_non_zero' is assigned using 'W_cmp_result'; if 'R_ctrl_br_cmp' is false and 'R_ctrl_rdctl_inst' is true, it is assigned using 'W_control_rd_data'; otherwise, the least significant 32 bits of 'W_alu_result' are assigned. This logic prioritizes the outputs of branch comparison, control read data, and ALU results, based on varying control signals.\n"
