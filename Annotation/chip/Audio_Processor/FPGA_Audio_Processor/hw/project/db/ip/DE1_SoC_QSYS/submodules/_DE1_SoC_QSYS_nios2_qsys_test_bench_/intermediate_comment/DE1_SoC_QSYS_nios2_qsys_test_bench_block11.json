    "block_comment": "This block of code manages data validation and error reporting under specific conditions in a synchronous process. On the rising edge of clock signal or falling edge of reset signal, the block initiates execution. If the reset signal ('reset_n') is low, it performs no action. If the 'W_valid' and 'R_wr_dst_reg' signals are true, it checks if the 'W_wr_data' is undefined ('x'). Upon encountering undefined 'W_wr_data', it writes an error message with the current simulation time and halts execution."
