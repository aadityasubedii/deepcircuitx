    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a Nios II processor core for a System-on-Chip design. It features a 5-stage pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback) and supports various instructions including arithmetic, logic, memory, and control flow operations. The module handles instruction fetching, decoding, execution, memory access, and result writeback. It includes logic for pipeline control, arithmetic and logic operations, memory interfacing, and JTAG debugging support. The design uses multiple always blocks and combinational logic to manage different pipeline stages and processor functions."
