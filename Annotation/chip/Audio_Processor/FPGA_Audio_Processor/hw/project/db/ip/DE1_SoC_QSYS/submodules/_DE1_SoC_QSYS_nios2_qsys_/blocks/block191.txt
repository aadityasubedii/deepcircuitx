Comment: 
The block assigns the output `E_cmp_result` based on the value of `R_compare_op`. The implementation uses a conditional operator to check the binary value of `R_compare_op` and sets the value of `E_cmp_result` according to the comparison result of two entities represented by `E_eq` and `E_lt`. If `R_compare_op` is '00', '01', '10', or anything else ('11' or don't care), `E_cmp_result` will be assigned `E_eq`, complement of `E_lt`, `E_lt`, or complement of `E_eq`, respectively.
