Comment: 
The block of code determines the byte enable signals for memory access. The 'E_mem_byte_en' signal is generated based on the memory size 'D_iw_memsz' and the two least significant bits of memory base address 'E_mem_baddr'. The combination of the memory size and bits of the base address leads to different values of the byte enable signal, enabling different bytes of the memory to be accessed. This achieves the intention of variable byte-level control of memory access, dictated by the size and base location of the memory.
