    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronous design pattern configuring a control register 'R_ctrl_crst'. It specifically responds to a positive edge clock pulse or negative edge reset signal. When a negative edge reset signal is detected (indicating a reset condition), the control register 'R_ctrl_crst' is set to zero. In the absence of reset and if 'R_en' is high (indicating an enable condition), 'R_ctrl_crst' is set to the value of 'R_ctrl_crst_nxt' on the next clock cycle. This lets it store new data coming in, or maintain its state, depending on the reset and enable signals."
