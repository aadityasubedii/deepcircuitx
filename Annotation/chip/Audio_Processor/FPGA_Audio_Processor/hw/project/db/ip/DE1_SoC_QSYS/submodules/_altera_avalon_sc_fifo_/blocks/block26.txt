Comment: 
This block is primarily responsible for assigning a valid output signal within the internal logic of your design. The signal 'internal_out_valid' indicates if the data can be forwarded from the module. The block employs a simple boolean operation, where 'internal_out_valid' is assigned the AND operation result between the negation of 'empty' and 'ok_to_forward'. If the buffer isn't empty and there's permission to forward, 'internal_out_valid' becomes true.
