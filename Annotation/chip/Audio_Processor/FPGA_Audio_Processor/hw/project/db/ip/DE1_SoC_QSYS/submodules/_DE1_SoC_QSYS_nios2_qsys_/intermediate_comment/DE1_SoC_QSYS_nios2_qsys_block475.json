    "block_comment": "This block is used to assign a default value to the signal `dbrk_hit1_latch`. The implementation details are straightforward: the `assign` keyword is used to assign the value `1'b0`, which is a 1-bit binary number with a value of 0, to the signal `dbrk_hit1_latch`. This means that `dbrk_hit1_latch` will continuously hold a low logic level (0) as its value."
