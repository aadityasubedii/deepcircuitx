This block of code performs a comparison operation for an address-matching event. Specifically, it uses an 'assign' statement to set the output 'oci_reg_01_addressed' to high (1) if the assigned address matches the hard-coded value of '9'h101'. If the address does not match, 'oci_reg_01_addressed' is set to low (0). As a result, this block allows for dynamic address checking in the system.
