    "block_comment": "The block of code is used for assigning the next value to the 'av_ld_byte2_data_nxt' signal based on specific conditions. If the 'av_ld_rshift8' signal is high, the present 'av_ld_byte3_data' value is passed onto 'av_ld_byte2_data_nxt'. If the 'av_ld_rshift8' signal is low and the 'av_ld_extend' is high, 8 bits based on 'av_fill_bit' are passed onto 'av_ld_byte2_data_nxt'. Otherwise, the 23rd to 16th bits of 'd_readdata' serve as the data for 'av_ld_byte2_data_nxt'."
