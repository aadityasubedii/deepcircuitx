This device-level timer precisely controls the execution of operations based on the system clock. The counter increments until it hits a specified value, at which point it triggers an interruption if one has been enabled. It supports both continuous and interrupt-based operation. Chip select, write enable signals, and address inputs allow specific registers to be written to, giving a mechanism to control the counter's behavior in different modes. The counter can also be manually started or stopped and its value can be read or force reloaded. The timer interrupt is notified via the irq output."

A high signal denotes that the module should expect a write or read operation.\n3. clk: The system clock signal. All the operations inside the module are synchronized to this signal.\n4. reset_n: An active low reset signal. Triggers reset operation when low.\n5. write_n: An active low write enable signal. A low signal enables a write operation while a high signal disables it.\n6. writedata: The data input that will be written to the selected register if write is enabled.\n\nExplanation: Control signals like address, chipselect, clk, reset_n and write_n determine when data are fetched or stored, whether the timer is running or idle, when to reload the timer, or when to interrupt. Writedata acts as the source for data written into the timer module.\n\nOutput ports:\n1. irq: The active high interrupt request output. When the counter runs out and if interrupts are enabled, this line becomes high to signal an interrupt request.\n2. readdata: The output data bus. The contents of the selected register appear on this line post a read operation.\n\nExplanation: Readdata outputs the value from the selected register allowing a user or another module to read the current timer value or status register. The irq output is used to signal when an interrupt event has occurred in the timer module."
