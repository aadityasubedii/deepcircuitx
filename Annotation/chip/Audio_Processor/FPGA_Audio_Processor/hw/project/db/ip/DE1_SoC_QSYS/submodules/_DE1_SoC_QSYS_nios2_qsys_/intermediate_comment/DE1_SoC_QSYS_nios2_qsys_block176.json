    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to assert a load stall signal (`E_ld_stall`). It assigns a condition to this signal that depends on the load control flag from the register (`R_ctrl_ld`) and checks whether there is a valid but not yet done advanced load (`E_valid & ~av_ld_done`), or a new instruction (`E_new_inst`). When either condition is met, the load stall signal is asserted."
