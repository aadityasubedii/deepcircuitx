    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for an asynchronous reset and synchronous load function of a control shift rotate right register. On every rising edge of the clock or whenever the reset signal is negated, it checks if the reset signal is active low and if it is, it clears the register 'R_ctrl_shift_rot_right' to 0. If the reset signal is not active, and the register-enable signal 'R_en' is high, it updates the register 'R_ctrl_shift_rot_right' with the next value 'R_ctrl_shift_rot_right_nxt' at the next positive edge of the clock."
