    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for a logical OR operation which outputs a true when either of the input variables - 'xbrk0_goto1_hit', 'xbrk1_goto1_hit', 'xbrk2_goto1_hit', or 'xbrk3_goto1_hit' - is true (high). Using the 'assign' keyword, this combinational logic is implemented and the output is stored in the 'xbrk_goto1_hit' variable."
