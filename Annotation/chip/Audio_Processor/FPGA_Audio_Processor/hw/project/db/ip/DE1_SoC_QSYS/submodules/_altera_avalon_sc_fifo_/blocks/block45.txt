This block handles the pointer updates for the operating memory block. Depending on particular conditions, it manipulates both the read and write pointers. If 'USE_MEMORY_BLOCKS' equals 1, it generates new read and write pointers (incremented_wr_ptr & incremented_rd_ptr) by adding 1 to the current wr_ptr and rd_ptr respectively. Depending on whether 'drop_on_error' is true or there's a write operation, next_wr_ptr is accordingly set. If 'drop_on_error' is true, next_wr_ptr equals to curr_sop_ptr, otherwise, if it's a write operation next_wr_ptr is updated to the incremented_wr_ptr else remains as wr_ptr. Similarly, the next_rd_ptr is a conditional assignment that gets updated to incremented_rd_ptr when a read operation is performed, or stays the same as the rd_ptr.
