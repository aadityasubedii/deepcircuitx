    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the lowest 27 bits of the W_alu_result to W_mem_baddr. The implementation makes use of the slice operator to extract a portion of W_alu_result from bit 26 down to bit 0, and assigns this subset to W_mem_baddr. The purpose of this block could be for either directly addressing a memory location or forming part of a larger address computation, assuming that W_alu_result is an output from an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) within the design."
