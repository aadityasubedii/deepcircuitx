Comment: 
This block is a synchronous memory write operation in a Verilog code. Upon the positive edge of `clk` or `reset`, the last array element `mem[DEPTH-1]` is reset to 0 if `reset` is true, else depending on the condition of `DEPTH` and `mem_used[DEPTH-1]`, the memory location gets the input specified by `in_payload` when `write` is asserted or if the memory is unused (`mem_used[DEPTH-1]` is false).
