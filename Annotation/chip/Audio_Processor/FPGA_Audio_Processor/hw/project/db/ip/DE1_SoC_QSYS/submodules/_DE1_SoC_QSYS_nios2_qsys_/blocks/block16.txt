Comment: 
The block of code assigns the value of 'D_op_rdctl' to 'D_ctrl_rdctl_inst'. The keyword 'assign' in Verilog RTL code indicates a continuous assignment statement. This means that whenever there is a change in the value of 'D_op_rdctl', the new value is immediately assigned to 'D_ctrl_rdctl_inst'. This block essentially creates a wire named 'D_ctrl_rdctl_inst' that tracks the value of 'D_op_rdctl'.
