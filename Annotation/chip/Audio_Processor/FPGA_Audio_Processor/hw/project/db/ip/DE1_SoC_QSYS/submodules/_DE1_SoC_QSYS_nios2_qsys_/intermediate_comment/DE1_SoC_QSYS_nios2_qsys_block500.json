    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a Finite State Machine (FSM) that manages the memory operations (read/write/access) over the JTAG interface, with the ability of using either oci ram or a config ROM for data storage. On a negative edge of jrst_n signal, it resets all the variables to their initial states. On a positive edge clock event, it assesses multiple conditions associated with actions such as take_no_action_ocimem_a, take_action_ocimem_a, and take_action_ocimem_b, and accordingly sets the various JTAG and memory-related signals as well as Monitor Address and Data Registers. It uses MonARegAddrInc and jdo for storing intermediate values. The logic controlling 'waitrequest' signal and 'avalon_ociram_readdata_ready' ensures appropriate manipulations during read and write operations."
