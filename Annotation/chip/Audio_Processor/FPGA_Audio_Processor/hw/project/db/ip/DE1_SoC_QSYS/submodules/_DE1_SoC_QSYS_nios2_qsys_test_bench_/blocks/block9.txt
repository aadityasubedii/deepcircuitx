Comment: 
This block of code acts as a hardware debugging watchdog tied to the system clock 'clk'. It stops the simulation if the bit-wise XOR reduction of d_write is unknown or high-impedance (or '-x'). When the clock rises ('posedge clk'), the block checks if a reset signal (reset_n) is not asserted. In that scenario, it checks if any bit within d_write is 'x'. If so, it writes an error message including the current simulation time to the standard output and terminates the simulation.
