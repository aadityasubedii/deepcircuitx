    "block_comment": "This is an FSM (Finite State Machine) primarily used for memory access control. Signals like read, write, and refresh are handled in different states. It uses edge-triggered synchronous reset logic; if reset happens, it initializes all registers to default values. In normal operation, it moves between states based on different conditions like initialization done, refresh requests, and FIFO status. It holds commands, address, data and other control signals for memory operations. For memory writes or reads, it decodes chip select signals, sets address, data, write mask, and sends command. Refresh operations are also scheduled in between operations. Finally, in each state, it prepares the values for the next state or repeats the current state for default cases."
