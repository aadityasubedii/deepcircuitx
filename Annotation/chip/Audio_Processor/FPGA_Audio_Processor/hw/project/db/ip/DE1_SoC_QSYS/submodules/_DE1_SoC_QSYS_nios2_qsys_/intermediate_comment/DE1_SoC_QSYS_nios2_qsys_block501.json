    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for generating the 'debugack' signal, which indicates the status of the debug acknowledgement. The 'debugack' signal is obtained by inverting the 'hbreak_enabled' signal. Hence, if the hardware breakpoint is enabled ('hbreak_enabled' is high), the 'debugack' is low and vice versa. The action is achieved using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog which continuously drives the 'debugack' signal with the inverse value of 'hbreak_enabled'. This allows for a real-time update of the debug acknowledgement status based on the hardware breakpoint's state."
