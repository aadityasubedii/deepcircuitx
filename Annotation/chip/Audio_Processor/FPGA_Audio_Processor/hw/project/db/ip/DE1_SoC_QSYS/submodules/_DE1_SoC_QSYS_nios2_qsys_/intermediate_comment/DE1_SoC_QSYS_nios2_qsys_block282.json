    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for resetting and updating the `fifo_12` register. It operates on either the positive edge of the `clk` signal or the negative edge of the `reset_n` signal. If `reset_n` is 0, the register `fifo_12` is reset to 0. Alternatively, if the `fifo_12_enable` signal is activated, the `fifo_12` register gets updated with the value of `fifo_12_mux`."
