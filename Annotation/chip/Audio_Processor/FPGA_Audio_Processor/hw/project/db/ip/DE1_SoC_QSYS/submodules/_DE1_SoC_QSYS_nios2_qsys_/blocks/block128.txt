This block asserts the enable signal for a specific write control operation. The `E_wrctl_ienable` signal is assigned a value based on a bitwise AND operation between `R_ctrl_wrctl_inst` and a condition check statement that verifies if `D_iw_control_regnum` matches the decimal value 3 (represented in 3-digit binary as '3'd3).
