Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for updating the value of the `E_xbrk_goto1` register. The update operation is sensitive to the rising edge of the system clock (`clk`) or the falling edge of the reset signal (`reset_n`). When a reset operation occurs (i.e., when `reset_n` is 0), the `E_xbrk_goto1` register is explicitly set to 0. Otherwise, if the `E_cpu_addr_en` signal is enabled, the register `E_xbrk_goto1` inherits the value from `xbrk_goto1_hit`.
