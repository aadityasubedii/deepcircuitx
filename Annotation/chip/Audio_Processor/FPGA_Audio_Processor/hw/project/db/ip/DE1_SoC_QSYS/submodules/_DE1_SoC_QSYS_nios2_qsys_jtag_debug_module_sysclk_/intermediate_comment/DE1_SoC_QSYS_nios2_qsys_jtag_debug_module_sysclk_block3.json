    "block_comment": "This block assigns the logic value to the 'take_no_action_break_c' signal based on specific conditions. It checks several signals and implements a logical AND operation. If the 'enable_action_strobe' signal is high, 'ir' signal is binary '10', and 36th and 35th bits of 'jdo' are high while the 37th bit of 'jdo' is low, then the 'take_no_action_break_c' signal is set high. Otherwise, the signal is set low."
