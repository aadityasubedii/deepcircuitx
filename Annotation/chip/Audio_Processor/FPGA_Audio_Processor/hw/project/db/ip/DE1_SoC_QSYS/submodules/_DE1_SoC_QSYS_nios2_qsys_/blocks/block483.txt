Comment: 
The block assigns the value of the 4th bit of `writedata` to `ocireg_sstep`. Here, the `assign` keyword is used for continuous assignment, meaning whenever there is a change in `writedata` the value of `ocireg_sstep` will be updated in the hardware. Specifically, it extracts the 4th bit from `writedata` using the bit-select index `[3]`, and assigns this bit value to `ocireg_sstep`.
