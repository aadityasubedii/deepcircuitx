    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for assigning the value of the 'compute_input_tm_cnt' signal to the 'input_tm_cnt' signal. The functionality of the block is achieved through the use of the 'assign' keyword in Verilog which continually assigns the value computed by the right-hand side of the expression to the left-hand side. Thus the wire 'input_tm_cnt' always reflects the current value of 'compute_input_tm_cnt'."
