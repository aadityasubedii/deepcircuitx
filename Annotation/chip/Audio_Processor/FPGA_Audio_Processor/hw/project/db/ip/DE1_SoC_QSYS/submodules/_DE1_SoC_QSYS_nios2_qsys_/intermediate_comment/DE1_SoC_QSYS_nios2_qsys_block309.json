    "block_comment": "This block of code describes the behavior of a resettable FIFO register in a synchronous logic design. It gets driven either during a positive edge of the clock or a negative edge of the reset signal. If the reset_n signal is 0 (active low), the value in the fifo_3 register resets to zero. If reset_n is not active and fifo_3_enable signal is high, the fifo_3 register captures the data presented to it on fifo_3_mux. The behavior aligns with common practices in hardware design where state must be preserved across clock cycles and can be reset in response to a specified signal."
