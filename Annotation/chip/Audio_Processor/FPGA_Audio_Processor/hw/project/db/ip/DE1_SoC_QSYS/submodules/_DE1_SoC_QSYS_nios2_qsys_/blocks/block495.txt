This block of code is for conditional assignment of data to be written into an On-Chip RAM (ociram). It chooses between two sources of data based on the status of the 'jtag_ram_access' signal. If 'jtag_ram_access' is HIGH, it assigns the lower 32 bits of the 'MonDReg' register to 'ociram_wr_data'. Otherwise, it assigns the value of 'writedata' to 'ociram_wr_data'.
