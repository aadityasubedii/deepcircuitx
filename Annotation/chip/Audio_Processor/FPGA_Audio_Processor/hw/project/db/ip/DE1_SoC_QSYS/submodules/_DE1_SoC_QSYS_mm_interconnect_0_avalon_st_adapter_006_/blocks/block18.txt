Comment: 
The given block of code is an unfinished conditional block in Verilog. Starting from `generate`, the code checks whether `inBitsPerSymbol` is not equal to 18. If `inBitsPerSymbol` is not equal to 18, it initiates a `begin` block to encapsulate the functionality of the given condition. However, in this snippet the conditional block is not fully defined, indicating the code yet to come. The `generate` defined at the start is a systematic keyword in Verilog which can create generate blocks of parameterizable hardware during compile time. The code allows the hardware to behave differently based on the value of `inBitsPerSymbol`.
