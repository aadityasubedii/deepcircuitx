    "block_comment": "This block is a counter that increases or resets when certain conditions are met. Upon reaching the required hex value (`0xh`), the counter resets itself and during this process, the `count_en` signal is checked at each clock cycle to determine whether to increment or not. The specific set and reset behavior of the counter are defined within the if-else control structures, which drive the increment or reset of the `count` signal, and the module uses rising edge-triggered flip-flops (`always @(posedge clk)`), ensuring the operations occur at specific points in the clock cycle."
