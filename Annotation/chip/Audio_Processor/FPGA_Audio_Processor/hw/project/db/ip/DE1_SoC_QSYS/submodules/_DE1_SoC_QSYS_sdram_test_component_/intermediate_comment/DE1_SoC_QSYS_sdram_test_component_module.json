    "module": "Module-level comment: This design includes two modules, DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module, an SDRAM mimic with a large memory array, accepts read/write operations contingent on the address and clock signals. DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component, a testbench controller, simulates SDRAM operations using various input controls and internal signals for data masking, command translation, latency management. An instance of the SDRAM mimic is summoned within this module, providing real-time memory operation simulation."
