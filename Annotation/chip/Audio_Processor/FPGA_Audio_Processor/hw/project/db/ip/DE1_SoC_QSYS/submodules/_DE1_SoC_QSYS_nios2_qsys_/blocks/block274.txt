The code block enables the 15th FIFO (First In, First Out) memory slot. The aim is to store incoming data at the correct position. Specifically, the FIFO enable signal is assigned to 1 under three conditions: the current write pointer is at '15' and there is at least one input data available (input_ge1); there are at least two free memory slots and the write pointer incremented by 1 equals '15', plus there are at least two input data available (input_ge2); or there are at least three free memory slots and the write pointer incremented by 2 equals '15', with at least three input data available (input_ge3).
