    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for the assignment of reset signal to the 'jrst_n' element. It achieves this function by directly associating 'reset_n' (an active low reset signal) with 'jrst_n' in a non-blocking assignment, meaning that when the reset signal changes, 'jrst_n' instantly gets the same value."
