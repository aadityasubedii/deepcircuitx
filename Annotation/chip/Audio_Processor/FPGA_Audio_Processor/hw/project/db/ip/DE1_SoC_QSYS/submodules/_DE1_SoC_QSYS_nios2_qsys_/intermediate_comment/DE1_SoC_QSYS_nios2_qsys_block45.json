    "block_comment": "This block of code is a simple signal assignment in a digital design. It passes the current value of the data control signal `D_ctrl_br_cmp` to the next stage signal `R_ctrl_br_cmp_nxt`. This is typically done in pipelined systems where computations or operations are divided into different stages. The operation happens continuously every clock cycle due to `assign` statement that drives continuous assignment in Verilog."
