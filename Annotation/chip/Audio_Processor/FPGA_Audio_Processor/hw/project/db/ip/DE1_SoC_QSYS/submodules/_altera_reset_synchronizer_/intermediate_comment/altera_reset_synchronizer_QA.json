The module takes an input clock signal and an input reset signal, and synchronizes the reset signal with the clock, outputting a single consequent reset signal. This is done through a chain of flip-flops equal to the defined depth, which sequentially passes the reset signal through, ensuring it aligns with the clock edge. Depending on the value of the ASYNC_RESET parameter, the reset logic can be asynchronous (trigger reset immediately) or synchronous (trigger reset at the next clock edge). The synchronous reset mode allows for control over potential metastability issues."
