    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous reset, clock-enabled register that stores the counter's zero-state. It resets to zero when reset_n signal is active low and updates the stored value at the positive edge of the clock signal if the clock-enable signal (clk_en) is high. The storage is the state of the 'counter_is_zero' signal."
