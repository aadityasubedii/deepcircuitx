    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is assigning a single bit from a vector to another wire. The specific function of the `assign` keyword is to continuously assign the value on the right-hand side of the equation to the variable on the left-hand side. In this instance, the second bit from the `input_tm_cnt` vector is assigned to the `input_ge2` wire. This action is continuously performed, making sure that the value of `input_ge2` always represents the status of the second bit of `input_tm_cnt`."
