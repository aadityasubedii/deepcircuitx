    "block_comment": "This block of code is a simple assignment operation for the variable `is_cond_dct`. The block is setting the variable `is_cond_dct` to a default or initial value of `1'b0` i.e., zero in binary representation. This could be preparations for later operations where the `is_cond_dct` binary switch might be turned on based on certain conditions."
