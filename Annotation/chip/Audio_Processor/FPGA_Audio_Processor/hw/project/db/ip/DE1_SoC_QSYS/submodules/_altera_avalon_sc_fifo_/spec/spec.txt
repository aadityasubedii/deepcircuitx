Module name: altera_avalon_sc_fifo. Module specification: This module implements a parameterizable Avalon streaming FIFO (First-In-First-Out) component designed by Altera. It supports various configurable options such as FIFO depth, data width, packet mode, and memory block usage. The module has input ports for clock (clk), reset, data input (in_data), and control signals (in_valid, in_startofpacket, in_endofpacket, in_empty, in_error, in_channel), as well as output ports for data output (out_data) and corresponding control signals. It also includes CSR (Control Status Register) interface ports for configuration and status reporting. Internally, the module uses signals like wr_ptr, rd_ptr, mem_used, and various flags to manage the FIFO operations. The code is organized into several blocks
