    "block_comment": "The line of code assigns a constant low signal, or logical '0', to the `is_dct` signal. It simply hard codes the `is_dct` signal as '0', meaning regardless of other conditions in the system, `is_dct` will always remain false or in a low state. This could be performed to disable a specific functionality or state which `is_dct` signal might control in a broader circuit design.\n"
