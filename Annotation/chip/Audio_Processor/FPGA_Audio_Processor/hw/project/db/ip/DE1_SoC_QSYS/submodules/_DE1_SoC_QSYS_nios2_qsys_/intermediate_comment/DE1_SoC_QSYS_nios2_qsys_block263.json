    "block_comment": "This line of code in Verilog works to control the value of the signal `tr_clk`. The ternary operation is used to switch and determine the value of `tr_clk`. When the condition '0' (which is always FALSE) is met, `tr_clk` takes the value of the register `tr_clk_reg`, otherwise its value is '0'. Given the static condition, in this case `tr_clk` is always assigned to '0'."
