It serves as the interface layer between debug signals/conditions and the system's debug actions. The module takes several inputs related to debug triggering conditions and generates outputs that dictate the appropriate debug actions. This module is likely used for real-time hardware debugging tasks during system runtime, allowing for easy interaction with and monitoring of the system state through a JTAG interface."
