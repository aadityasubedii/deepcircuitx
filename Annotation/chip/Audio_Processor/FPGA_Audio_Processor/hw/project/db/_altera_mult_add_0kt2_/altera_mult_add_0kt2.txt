Module-level comment: The altera_mult_add_0kt2 module carries out multiplication and addition on 16-bit 'dataa' and 'datab' inputs, synchronized by 'clock0' and can reset with 'aclr0'. Internally, the module employs an instance of 'altera_mult_add_rtl' which performs these computations based on set parameters and ports configurations. The result wire 'wire_altera_mult_add_rtl1_result' conveys the computed output to the 'result' port.
