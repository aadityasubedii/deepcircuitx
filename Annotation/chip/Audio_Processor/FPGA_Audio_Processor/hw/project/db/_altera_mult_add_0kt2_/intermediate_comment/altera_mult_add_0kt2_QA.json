It accepts two inputs, 'dataa' and 'datab', each of 16 bits, along with a clock and an auto-clear signal. It produces a result which is also of 16 bits. It does this by calling an internal instance of a multiply-add function block: 'altera_mult_add_rtl'. This building block includes multiple settable parameters and ports to control and monitor its operation, such as overflows, rounding, multiplier saturation etc. The results are then assigned to the main 'result' output. The actual operation (multiplication, addition or other) depends on specific configurations of the 'altera_mult_add_rtl' block instance in the code, most of which are set by defparam statements in the module code."
