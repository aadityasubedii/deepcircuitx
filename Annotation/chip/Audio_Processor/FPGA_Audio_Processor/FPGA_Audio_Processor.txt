The FPGA_Audio_Processor repository is a sophisticated collection of modules designed for the DE1-SoC FPGA platform, orchestrated to handle audio processing alongside various other functionalities. It integrates a NIOS II processor, manages memory operations through a dynamic RAM tester and a system identifier, enables data flow via an interconnect fabric, and interfaces peripherals including SDRAM and a JTAG UART. The repository features extensive use of test benches like those for the NIOS II processor and OCI, as well as specialized implementations such as a phase-locked loop (PLL) for clock management, various serializers and deserializers for audio data, and FIFO buffers for data storage and flow control. Each submodule in the repository has been tailored to serve specific functions, establishing a robust infrastructure supporting both developmental and operational phases of FPGA-based system design. Through a combination of parameterized, memory-mapped operations and interfacing through industry-standard protocols like I2C and Avalon-ST, the repository stands as a comprehensive suite for developing and testing SoC implementations on the DE1-SoC platform.
