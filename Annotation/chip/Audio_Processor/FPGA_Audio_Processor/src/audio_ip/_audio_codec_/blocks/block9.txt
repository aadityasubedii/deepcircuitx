Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for synchronizing the ADC channel. The synchronization happens on the positive edge of a 50MHz clock signal. If the reset signal is active, it indicates that the ADC channel is not synchronized, so the done_adc_channel_sync signal is set to 0. If there is a rising edge on the ADC left/right clock (adc_lrclk_rising_edge), it signals that synchronization is complete, so the done_adc_channel_sync signal is set to 1.
