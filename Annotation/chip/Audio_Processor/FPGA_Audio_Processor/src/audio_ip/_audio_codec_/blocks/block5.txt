Comment: 
This Verilog block utilizes the Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module to detect both rising and falling edges of the AUD_ADCLRCK clock signal. The system's main clock CLOCK_50 and a reset signal function as control signals for the edge detection. The edges detected are passed on to adc_lrclk_rising_edge and adc_lrclk_falling_edge respectively.
