Comment: 
This block of code is a sequential logic handling the reset and sync signals of a DAC channel. It triggers at the positive edge of a 50MHz clock. When the 'reset' signal is active high, 'done_dac_channel_sync' is set to inactive low, essentially resetting the sync status. But when a falling edge is detected on 'dac_lrclk_falling_edge', the 'done_dac_channel_sync' is set to active high, indicating that the DAC channel synchronization has been finished.
