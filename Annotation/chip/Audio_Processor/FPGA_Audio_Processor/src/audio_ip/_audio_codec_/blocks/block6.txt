The block of code connects a clock signal generator to output ports that indicate rising and falling edge events. Specifically, it uses an Altera_UP_Clock_Edge instance â€“ a component module provided in Altera's University Program for detecting edge transitions of clock signals. The `CLOCK_50` input signal acts as the primary clock source, while `reset` is used for initiating a reset event. The `AUD_BCLK` is forwarded to `test_clk` for edge testing purpose. The resulting detections for rising and falling edges are then forwarded to `bclk_rising_edge` and `bclk_falling_edge` respectively.
