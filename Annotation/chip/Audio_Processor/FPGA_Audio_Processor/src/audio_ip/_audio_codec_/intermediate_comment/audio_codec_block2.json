    "block_comment": "This Verilog block describes the interface for a provided Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer module named Audio_Out_Serializer. The main function of this module is to serialize audio data for output. It takes multiple clock signals, including a bit-level clock and a channel-level clock, as well as enable and write signals for the left and right audio channels. Audio data for the left and right channels are serialized according to a signal and output through 'serial_audio_out_data'. Conditionals are present to ensure that data is only written when there is space available in the FIFO write space."
