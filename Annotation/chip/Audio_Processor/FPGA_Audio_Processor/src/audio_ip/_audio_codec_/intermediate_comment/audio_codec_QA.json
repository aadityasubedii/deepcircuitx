The module handles both input and output signals for audio processing. It employs Altera's utility blocks like clock edge detector and audio serializers/deserializers. On the input side, it converts audio data from a serial format to a parallel format. On the output side, it converts data from parallel format to a serial format that can be output to an audio device. Read and write capabilities are also provided and these are indicated by read and write ready signals. It also manages synchronization of audio data to the left and right channels."

The audio data is read from the AUD_ADCDAT input, deserialized for internal processing and the resultant parallel data can be read via readdata_left and readdata_right outputs. On the other hand, parallel audio data to be outputted is fed via writedata_left and writedata_right inputs, serialized, and then outputted through AUD_DACDAT."
