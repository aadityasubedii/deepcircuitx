    "block_comment": "This block of code depicts an instantiation of an audio input deserializer in Verilog. The component is developed using Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer and it is responsible for deserializing incoming audio data. As external signals, it accepts various clocks (both rising and falling edges) and serial Audio Input Data. Based on the read condition, the deserializer accesses the left and right audio data separately. The read condition is on when the system is in read state and each channel has a non-zero amount of available data. This data is registered and read out as 'new_left_channel_audio' and 'new_right_channel_audio', respectively. The audio deserializer is also capable of synchronizing channels as denoted by the 'done_channel_sync' signal."
