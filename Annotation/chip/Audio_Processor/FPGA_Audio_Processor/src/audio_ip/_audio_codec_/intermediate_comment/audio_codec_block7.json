    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to manage read and write operations of audio data. The first two lines check the availability of read and write operations for the left and right audio channels. The variables `read_ready` and `write_ready` are set high if there is data available in the respective channels. In the next two lines, audio data is read from the channels. The audio data from the left channel is assigned to `readdata_left`, while the data from the right channel is assigned to `readdata_right`."
