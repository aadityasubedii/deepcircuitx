    "module": "Module-level comment: The audio_codec module undertakes the handling of an FPGA-based system's audio codec interface, servicing both audio input and output pathways. It employs Altera's utility blocks to detect clock edges, and to serialize/deserialize audio data. It uses multiple input and output ports for receiving audio data, controlling operations, and for providing status signals. It implements read and write capabilities for both left and right audio channels, facilitated through a number of internal control and indicator signals."
