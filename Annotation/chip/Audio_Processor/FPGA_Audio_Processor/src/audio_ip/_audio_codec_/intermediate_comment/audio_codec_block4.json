    "block_comment": "The block of code generates the rising and falling edges for a DAC Left-Right Clock, which aids in the digital to analog conversion process in audio systems. The block achieves this by utilizing the Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module which is designed to generate both the rising and falling edges. The module takes in the system clock (CLOCK_50), reset signal, and output test clock (AUD_DACLRCK), and generates corresponding rising edge (dac_lrclk_rising_edge) and falling edge (dac_lrclk_falling_edge) signals."
