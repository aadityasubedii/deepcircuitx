Module name: Altera_UP_Clock_Edge.

Module specification: The Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module is a synchronous circuit designed to detect and signalize the rising and falling edges of a test clock signal. The module uses three input ports, 'clk', 'reset', and 'test_clk'. Port 'clk' serves as the main clock signal to which the module is synchronous and is used to update the internal 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk' registers. 'reset' is an unused port which, in other options, can be used to initialize the module to a known good state. 'test_clk' is the clock signal whose edge transitions are being monitored. The module has two output ports 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge'. 'rising_edge' signals when a rising edge transition (0 to 1) on 'test_clk' is detected, 'falling_edge' signals when a falling edge transition (1 to 0) is detected. Internally, the module updates 'cur_test_clk' with the current state of 'test_clk' on every positive edge of 'clk'. Simultaneously, 'last_test_clk' is updated with the state of 'cur_test_clk', effectively holding the previous state of 'test_clk'. An internal wire signal 'found_edge' is used to indicate a state change in 'test_clk'. This is done by XOR operation between 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk'. Finally, the 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge' assignments use 'found_edge' and 'cur_test_clk' OR 'last_test_clk' respectively to indicate a successful edge transition, providing a comprehensive tool for monitoring edge transitions on a test clock signal in synchronous digital circuits.
