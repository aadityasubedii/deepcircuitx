    "block_comment": "This block is an edge detection logic in a circuit design. It uses the exclusive or (XOR) operation to compare the previous and current values of the test clock (`last_test_clk` and `cur_test_clk`) to determine if there has been a change or an edge. The newly detected edge is assigned to the `found_edge` signal."
