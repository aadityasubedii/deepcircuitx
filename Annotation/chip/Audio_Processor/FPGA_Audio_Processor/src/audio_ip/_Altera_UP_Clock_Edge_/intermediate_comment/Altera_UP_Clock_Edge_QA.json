It compares the current and previous states of the test_clk signal, using two registers to maintain these states, and employs XOR operation to detect a change (rising or falling edge). A rising edge is identified when the current test clock is high (1), and a falling edge is identified when the last test clock is high (1). The found edges are synchronous with the main clock clk, making them suitable for use in synchronous digital circuits."
