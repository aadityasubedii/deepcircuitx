    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to detect a falling edge in a clock signal. It uses a bitwise AND operation to compare the current state of 'found_edge' and 'last_test_clk'. If both signals are high or '1', this block assigns '1' to 'falling_edge', denoting that a falling edge has been identified."
