This block of code is responsible for synchronizing `test_clk` to the main clock `clk`. On every positive edge of the main clock `clk`, the current value of `test_clk` is captured and stored into the intermediary signal `cur_test_clk`. This is an implementation of a basic D-flip flop and helps to alleviate metastability issues, ensuring that the `test_clk` follows the same clock domain as `clk` for consistent data processing.
