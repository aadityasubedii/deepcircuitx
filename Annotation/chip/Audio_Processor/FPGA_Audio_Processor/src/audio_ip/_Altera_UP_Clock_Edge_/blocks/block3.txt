Comment: 
The block of code detects a rising edge in a given clock signal. It does this by using the bitwise AND operation (&) on `found_edge` and `current_test_clk`, whereby `rising_edge` is assigned the resulting value. The `current_test_clk` holds the current status of the clock, while `found_edge` keeps track of whether an edge is detected. An edge is considered rising if previously the clock was detected as low (`found_edge` = 0) and currently, it is high (`cur_test_clk` = 1).
