Module-level comment: This Altera_UP_I2C module implements I2C protocol for inter-chip communication. It manages operation through multiple states: idle, start, byte transfer, acknowledge transfer, stop, and complete. The transitions between states are controlled by a Finite State Machine (FSM). The module utilizes multiple inputs including data, control signals, and clock signals and provides output signals including data from the I2C bus, acknowledgement indicators, and bus condition signals. It also includes internal signals to track current byte, current bit, and FSM states, contributing to the precise operation of the I2C protocol sequences.
