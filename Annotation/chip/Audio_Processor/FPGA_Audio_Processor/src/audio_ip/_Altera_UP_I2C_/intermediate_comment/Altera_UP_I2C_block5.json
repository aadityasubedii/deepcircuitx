    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a reset and data load function. If the reset signal is high, the current_byte variable is set to zero, effectively resetting it. The block also loads the data_in into current_byte when the state of s_i2c_transceiver is either I2C_STATE_0_IDLE or I2C_STATE_2_START_BIT, thus handling the initial conditions of the I2C transceiver."
