    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for enabling a clock signal in an I2C transceiver when it is neither in the idle nor in the complete state. The clock is enabled by negating the states `I2C_STATE_0_IDLE` and `I2C_STATE_6_COMPLETE` associated with the `s_i2c_transceiver` state machine. If either of these states is true, the clock signal is disabled, ensuring that the clock only operates when the I2C transceiver is actively transmitting or receiving data."
