Incoming signals include flags to begin data transfer or read a byte, the number of bits to transfer, and the data itself, along with various clock and control signals. Outputs include acknowledgement flags, the data read from the I2C bus, and indications of when data transfer is complete. Aiming to follow the I2C protocol, the module can accordingly generate start and stop conditions, read/write bytes, and generate/acknowledge conditions on the bus. This module also presents an implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) for transitioning between the several states during protocol operation, such as idle, start, transfer, transfer of acknowledgement, stop, and complete states."
