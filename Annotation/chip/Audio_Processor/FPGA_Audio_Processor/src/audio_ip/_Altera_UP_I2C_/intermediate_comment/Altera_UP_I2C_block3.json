    "block_comment": "This block controls the I2C data (i2c_sdata) according to the I2C transceiver state (s_i2c_transceiver). It implements conditions based on the transceiver's state, setting the data line to low (1'b0) when the state corresponds to 'Start bit', 'Stop bit', 'Transfer Acknowledgement' during a read operation, and 'Transfer byte' during a write operation. The data line is set to high impedance (1'bz) when none of the conditions is met, and it output the bit from current_byte[current_bit] when the transceiver is in the 'Transfer byte' state during the write operation."
