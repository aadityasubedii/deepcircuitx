    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the bit counter in a I2C transceiver interface. It resets the 'current_bit' to 0 when a reset signal is received. In the phase of transferring data byte (s_i2c_transceiver == I2C_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE) and the 'change_output_bit_en' is enabled, it decrements the 'current_bit'. If the transceiver is not in the data transfer state, 'current_bit' is refilled with the total number of bits to be transferred (\"num_bits_to_transfer\")."
