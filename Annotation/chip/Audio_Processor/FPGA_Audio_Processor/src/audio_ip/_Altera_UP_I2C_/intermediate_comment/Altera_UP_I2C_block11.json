    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a state machine for an I2C transceiver. Upon each clock cycle, it checks if a reset has been enforced; if so, it sets the state of the I2C transceiver to idle (`I2C_STATE_0_IDLE`). If no reset is performed, it moves the transceiver to the next state (`ns_i2c_transceiver`). This implementation ensures that the state machine can return to a neutral state in response to a reset call in any subsequent clock cycle."
