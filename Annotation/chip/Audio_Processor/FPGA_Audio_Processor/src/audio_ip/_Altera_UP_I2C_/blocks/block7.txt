This block performs data reading from an I2C interface. On each clock cycle, it checks the reset signal: if high, the incoming data from the I2C interface is cleared. If reset is not asserted, and when the start and stop conditions are enabled, and the I2C state machine is in transfer byte state, the block stores the incoming serial I2C data by shifting the previous data and placing the incoming bit at the least significant bit location.
