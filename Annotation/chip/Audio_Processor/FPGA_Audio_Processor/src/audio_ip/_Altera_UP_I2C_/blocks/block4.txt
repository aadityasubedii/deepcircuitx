Comment: 
This block of code controls the I2C Serial Clock Line (SCLK). Depending on the state of the I2C bus mode and the transceiver state, it assigns the corresponding signal to the I2C SCLK. If the I2C bus mode is binary 0, the SCLK is driven by a 400KHz clock. If the bus mode is not binary 0, and the I2C transceiver state is either in byte transfer or acknowledgment transfer state, the SCLK will still be driven by the 400KHz clock. In other situations, SCLK is assigned a binary 0, effectively disabling the operation.
