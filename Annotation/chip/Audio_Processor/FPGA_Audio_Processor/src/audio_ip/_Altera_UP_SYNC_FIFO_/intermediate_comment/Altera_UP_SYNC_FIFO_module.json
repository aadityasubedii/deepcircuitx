    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO module is a synchronous FIFO memory buffer following Altera's Universal Peripheral standard. It handles data storage with the ability to read and write. This functionality is achieved using direct signal mapping between input/output ports and the internal Altera 'scfifo' instance, with no intermediate signal manipulation. Its operation is directed by configurable parameters pertaining to data width, depth, and address width."
