The FIFO is used to store data and can be written to and read from. It employs a clock signal for synchronous operation and includes flags to indicate when it's empty or full. The 'words_used' signal shows how much data is currently stored. The 'DATA_WIDTH', 'DATA_DEPTH', and 'ADDR_WIDTH' parameters can be configured to set the width of the stored data, depth of the FIFO, and address width respectively. The module utilizes an instance of 'scfifo' which is a predefined synchronous FIFO module from Altera. Configuration parameters are set for 'scfifo' to match the required FIFO functionality."
