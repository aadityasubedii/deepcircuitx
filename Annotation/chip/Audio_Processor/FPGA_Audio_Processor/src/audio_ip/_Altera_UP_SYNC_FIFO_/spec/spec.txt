Module name: Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO. 

Module specification: The Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO, a Verilog RTL module, serves as a Synchronous First In, First Out (FIFO) memory buffer that leverages Altera's Universal Peripheral standard. Its main function is data storage, providing read and write operations with aid of a clock signal. It features five input ports: 'clk' (the clock signal), 'reset' (synchronous reset signal), 'write_en' (enables writing), 'write_data' (data being written), and 'read_en' (enables reading). With respect to output ports, it consists of 'fifo_is_empty' (indicates an empty FIFO), 'fifo_is_full' (indicates a full FIFO), 'words_used' (represents the number of data words stored currently), and 'read_data' (outputs data read from the FIFO). On a side note, there are no internal signals, as all signals are directly mapped to the pins of the internal instance, 'scfifo'. The 'scfifo' is a synchronous FIFO module predefined by Altera, and its parameters are set to align with the intended FIFO functionality. In sum, the module runs as a direct mapping platform with no internal signal manipulation, embodying a streamlined structure that efficiently links the input/output ports to the internal 'scfifo' instance.
