    "block_comment": "The block of code is a state machine sequencer in I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) interface initialisation with 'reset' and 'clk' as stimuli. When a rising edge of 'clk' is detected, if 'reset' signal is high, the state machine is reset to AUTO_STATE_0_CHECK_STATUS. If 'reset' is low, the current state is maintained as defined by the next state 'ns_i2c_auto_init'."
