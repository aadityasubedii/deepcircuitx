    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog RTL is implementing an automated initialisation completion signal. It does this by leveraging a conditional assignment operation to automatically set the `auto_init_complete` signal to true whenever the `s_i2c_auto_init` state machine reaches the `AUTO_STATE_7_DONE` state, signifying that initialisation is complete."
