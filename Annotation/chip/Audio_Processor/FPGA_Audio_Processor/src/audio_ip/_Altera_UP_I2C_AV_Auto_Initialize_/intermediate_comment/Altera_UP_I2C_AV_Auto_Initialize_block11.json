    "block_comment": "This verilog block is used as a state machine automating Initialisation of I2C communication protocol. It works by evaluating various states (AUTO_STATE_0_CHECK_STATUS, AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT, etc.) to perform specific tasks such as checking the status, sending a start bit, transferring bytes, waiting and stopping bit transmission. States transition from one to another based on different conditions such as completion of transfer, status of 'change_state' signal, and bits in 'rom_data'. A default case is included, directing to AUTO_STATE_0_CHECK_STATUS if none of the states are met."
