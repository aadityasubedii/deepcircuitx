    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is functioning as a state change detector by combining two conditions. Specifically, the state change happens when both a data transfer completes and some transfer data is present. For implementation, it employs the bitwise AND operator, '&', to assess both conditions ('transfer_complete' and 'transfer_data') simultaneously. If both are true (binary '1'), the assign statement sets 'change_state' to true, indicating a required state change."
