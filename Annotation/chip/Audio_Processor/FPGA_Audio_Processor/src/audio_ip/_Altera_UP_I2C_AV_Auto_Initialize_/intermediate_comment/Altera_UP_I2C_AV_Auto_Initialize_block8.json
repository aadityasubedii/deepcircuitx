    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the status of the `send_start_bit` signal in an I2C protocol implementation. The block is sensitive to the positive edge of the `clk` signal, meaning it will evaluate the conditions and set the signal accordingly on every clock cycle. If the `reset` signal is asserted or the I2C transfer is complete (`transfer_complete == 1'b1`), the `send_start_bit` is cleared. However, if the state machine is in the `AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT` state, the `send_start_bit` is set, initiating the start of I2C data transfer."
