This block of code determines when the initialization of ROM is complete. It does this by comparing the current value of the `rom_address_counter` to `MAX_ROM_ADDRESS`. When the two are equal, the initialization process has reached the maximum addressable space of the ROM, meaning that the initialization is finished. Therefore, `finished_auto_init` gets assigned a 'true' value.
