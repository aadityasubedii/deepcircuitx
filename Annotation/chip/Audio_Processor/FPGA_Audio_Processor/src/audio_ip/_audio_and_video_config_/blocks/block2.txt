This block is for configuring the audio parameters in the Auto_Initialize module. These configurations are achieved through the use of `defparam` which sets a constant system-wide parameter. The settings include ranges for ROM addresses, line input and output connections for both left and right channels, ADC and DAC signal paths, power, data format configurations, sample control settings, and audio setup activation.
