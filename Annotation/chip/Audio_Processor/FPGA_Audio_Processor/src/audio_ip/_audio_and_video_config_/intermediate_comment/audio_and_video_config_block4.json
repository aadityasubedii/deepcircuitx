    "block_comment": "The statement assigns the value of the signal `auto_init_stop_bit` to the signal `send_stop_bit`. Its function is to control when the stop bit should be automatically initiated in the rest of the design. It is implemented in a direct way; the value of `send_stop_bit` will directly follow any changes to `auto_init_stop_bit`, which can be manipulated elsewhere in the code. It behaves like a wire, connecting `auto_init_stop_bit` to wherever `send_stop_bit` is needed."
