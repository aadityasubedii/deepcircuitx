It uses I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol to communicate with other hardware components. It includes several parameters for configuring audio input and output line controls, ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) path, power and data format, etc. It has three contained submodules for this purpose: Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator, Altera_UP_I2C_AV_Auto_Initialize, and Altera_UP_I2C. This configuration is performed via a slower clock (400KHz), which is generated within the module. Primarily, it seems to be used for initializing audio and video settings on an Altera hardware setup."
