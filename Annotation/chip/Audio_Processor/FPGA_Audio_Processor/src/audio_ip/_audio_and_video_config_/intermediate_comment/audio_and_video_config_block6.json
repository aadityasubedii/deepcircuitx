    "block_comment": "This code block is assigning the value of the auto_init_transfer_data variable to the transfer_data variable. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used to model combinational logic circuits. This means the value of transfer_data will always follow the value of auto_init_transfer_data in real-time, hence always keeping them in sync."
