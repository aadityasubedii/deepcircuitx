    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to set the parameters for a 400KHz clock generator in Verilog. Specifically, it sets the number of counter bits (`COUNTER_BITS`) to 10 and the increment value (`COUNTER_INC`) of the counter to 1 (represented in hexadecimal as 'h001) in the module named `Clock_Generator_400KHz`. These parameters help control the clock generation frequency by defining the clock divider values."
