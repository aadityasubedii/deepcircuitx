    "module": "Module-level comment: This is the 'audio_and_video_config' module, managing audio and video settings in hardware designs via the I2C protocol. Two inputs, CLOCK_50 and reset, govern its timing and state. Data flow occurs through the I2C_SDAT InOut port, synchronized with I2C_SCLK output. Internally, the module uses signals to handle data and operational conditions, aided by three submodules: Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator, Altera_UP_I2C_AV_Auto_Initialize, and Altera_UP_I2C. Detailed operation is defined within the assigned blocks and parameters of these submodules."
