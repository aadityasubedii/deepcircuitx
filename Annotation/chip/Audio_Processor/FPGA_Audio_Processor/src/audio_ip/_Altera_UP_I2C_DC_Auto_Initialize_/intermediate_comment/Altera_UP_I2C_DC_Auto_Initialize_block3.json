    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for managing state transitions in a hardware design. This state transition only occurs when both 'transfer_complete' and 'transfer_data' are high (logic 1). It uses an 'assign' statement in Verilog, implementing a combinational logic where the output 'change_state' depends on the current values of 'transfer_complete' and 'transfer_data'."
