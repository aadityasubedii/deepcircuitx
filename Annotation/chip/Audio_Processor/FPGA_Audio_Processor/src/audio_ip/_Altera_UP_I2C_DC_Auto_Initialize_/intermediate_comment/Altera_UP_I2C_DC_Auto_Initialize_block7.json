    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the `send_stop_bit` signal in an I\u00b2C interface. On every rising edge of the clock, the code checks if the condition for reset or transfer completion is met; if either is true, it sets `send_stop_bit` to 0, effectively negating the stop bit transmission in the I\u00b2C interface. Additionally, if the `s_i2c_auto_init` state machine is in the `AUTO_STATE_6_SEND_STOP_BIT` state, the `send_stop_bit` is set to 1, triggering the transmission of a stop bit in the I\u00b2C interface."
