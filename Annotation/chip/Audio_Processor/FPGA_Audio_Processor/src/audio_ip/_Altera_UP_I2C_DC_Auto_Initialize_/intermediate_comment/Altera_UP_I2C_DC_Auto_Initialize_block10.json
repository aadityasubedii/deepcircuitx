    "block_comment": "This block operates as a state machine for an I2C data transfer on a positive edge of the clock. The output data (data_out) is chosen based on the current state of the 's_i2c_auto_init' signal. When reset is high, 'data_out' is reset to zero. If 's_i2c_auto_init' is in different AUTO_STATE, 'data_out' is set to various predefined bits from 'rom_data'."
