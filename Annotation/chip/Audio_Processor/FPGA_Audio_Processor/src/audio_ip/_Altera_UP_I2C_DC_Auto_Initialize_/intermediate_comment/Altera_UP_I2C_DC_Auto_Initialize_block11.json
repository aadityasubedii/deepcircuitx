    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is an implementation of a finite state machine (FSM) for handling I2C initialization in an automatic manner. Starting from a status check state, it implements various operations like sending start bit, transferring bytes, waiting for transfer completion, sending stop bits and increasing the counter, based on conditions relating to finished initialization, ROM data bits, state changes, and transfer completeness. It cycles back to the status check state unless the initialization is done. If the current state doesn't match any predefined states, it defaults back to the status check state."
