The block of code is used to automatically signal the completion of initialization, once all addresses of the ROM have been assessed. It achieves this through an assignment operation, where a condition is checked if the rom_address_counter has reached MAX_ROM_ADDRESS. Where `MAX_ROM_ADDRESS` is the last addressable location in the ROM. Once this condition is met, the `finished_auto_init` signal is set to true indicating that the initialization of ROM is finished.
