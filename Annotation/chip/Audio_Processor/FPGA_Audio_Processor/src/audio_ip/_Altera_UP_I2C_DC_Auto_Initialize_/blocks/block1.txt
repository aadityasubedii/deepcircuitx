Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is designed to assign specific values to the `rom_data` variable based on the current value of the `rom_address_counter`. This is achieved via a case statement, where each integer value of the `rom_address_counter` maps to a different assignment operation for `rom_data`. For instance, when `rom_address_counter` equals 0, `rom_data` is given the value of the hexadecimal values 201 and `DC_ROW_START` concatenated together. For values of `rom_address_counter` not explicitly stated, `rom_data` is assigned with hexadecimal value '1000000.
