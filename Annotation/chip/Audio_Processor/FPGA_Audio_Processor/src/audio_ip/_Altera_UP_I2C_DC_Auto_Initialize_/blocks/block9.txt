This block of code is used to control the data transfer over an automated I2C bus. Upon each rising edge of the clock signal, the `transfer_data` variable is updated. If `reset` is high, or a transfer has just been completed, `transfer_data` is cleared. Otherwise, if the I2C bus is in any of the four states that signify data transfer (`AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT`, `AUTO_STATE_2_TRANSFER_BYTE_0`, `AUTO_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE_1`, `AUTO_STATE_4_TRANSFER_BYTE_2`), `transfer_data` is set to high, indicating that data is being transferred.
