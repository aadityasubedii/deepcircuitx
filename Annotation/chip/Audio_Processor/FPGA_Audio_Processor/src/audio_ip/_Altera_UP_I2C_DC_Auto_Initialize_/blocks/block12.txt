Comment: 
The block manages the transition states of an I2C protocol while taking into consideration a reset signal. Upon the arrival of a positive clock edge, it checks if a reset signal has been sent. If the reset signal is high, the I2C protocol is moved back to the initial status checking state (`AUTO_STATE_0_CHECK_STATUS`). However, if there isn't reset signal, the existing state of the I2C protocol (`ns_i2c_auto_init`) is maintained.
