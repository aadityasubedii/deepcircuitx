Module-level comment: The module Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter is designed to count audio bits. It operates based on a primary clk signal and can be reset by a high reset signal. The bit and left_right clock edges manage the counter. The module has one output, "counting", signaling bit counting activity. Internally, a 5-bit register bit_counter tracks the count, reset by the wire reset_bit_counter when the left_right clock edges are high. The code uses two "always" blocks for managing operations tied to the clk signal and an assignment for managing the reset_bit_counter value.
