    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for generating a signal, `reset_bit_counter`, whenever there is a rising or falling edge in the `left_right_clk`. Specifically, the block uses the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to assert `reset_bit_counter` whenever either `left_right_clk_rising_edge` or `left_right_clk_falling_edge` is true.\n"
