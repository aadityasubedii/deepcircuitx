It is operated with a clock signal (clk), and possibly reset signal (reset). It counts the audio bits on a falling bit clock edge (bit_clk_falling_edge) until the count reaches 0. The counter resets either when a reset signal is active high or when either of the left_right_clk (left_right_clk_rising_edge or left_right_clk_falling_edge) edges occur. The 'counting' output indicates whether the counter is in progress. It turns off if the counter reaches 0 or reset signal is given, and it turns on when the counter reset signal (reset_bit_counter) is given.\n"
