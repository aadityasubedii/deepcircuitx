    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling a counter known as `bit_counter`. The counter's value is determined by several conditional circumstances. To start, in the event of a system reset `(reset == 1'b1)`, it is set to zero. Moreover, if a separate reset signal for the `bit_counter` itself is received `(reset_bit_counter == 1'b1)`, the counter is initialized to a predefined value `BIT_COUNTER_INIT`. Lastly, should a falling edge of another clock `bit_clk_falling_edge` be detected and the `bit_counter` is not already zero, the counter will decrement by 1. The `bit_counter` changes its value only upon the rising edge of `clk`, ensuring that the updates align with the system clock timing."
