Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter. 

Module specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter is a hardware module designed to count audio bits in a digital audio system. Its functionality is synchronized with a main system clock (clk) and can be reset by an active high reset signal (reset). The module primarily operates with two clocks – the bit clock and the left_right clock. 

Input Ports: The module has six different input ports. The clk and reset control the counter's operation at a system level. The bit (bit_clk_rising_edge and bit_clk_falling_edge) and left_right (left_right_clk_rising_edge and left_right_clk_falling_edge) clock edges control the process of audio bit counting and resetting of the counter. 

Output Ports: The module has a single output port, counting, that indicates if the system is currently counting the audio bits. 

Internal Signals: The module uses two internal signals – the bit_counter, that is a 5-bit register keeping track of the audio bit counts, and reset_bit_counter, a wire that resets the bit_counter. 

The code can be divided into three main blocks. In the first block, the module's input and output ports and the internal signals are defined and declared. The second block consists of two always blocks that contain the logic functionality of the module. The last block contains the assignment statement for reset_bit_counter signal. The first always block controls the functionality of bit_counter based on the bit clock and reset signals, while the second controls the counting output based on the system's counting state. Overall, this module represents a crucial component for controlling and monitoring an audio bit stream in a digital audio system.
