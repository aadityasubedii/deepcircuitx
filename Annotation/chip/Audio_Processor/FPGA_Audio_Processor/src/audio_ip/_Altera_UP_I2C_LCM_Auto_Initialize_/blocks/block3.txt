Comment: 
This line of code assigns the 'change_state' variable with the result of a bitwise AND operation between 'transfer_complete' and 'transfer_data'. The 'change_state' flag will be set (high) when both 'transfer_complete' and 'transfer_data' are high (true), indicating that a data transfer process has been completed. If either 'transfer_complete' or 'transfer_data' is low (false), 'change_state' will be cleared (low). This bitwise AND operation allows 'change_state' to accurately reflect the state of the data transfer process.
