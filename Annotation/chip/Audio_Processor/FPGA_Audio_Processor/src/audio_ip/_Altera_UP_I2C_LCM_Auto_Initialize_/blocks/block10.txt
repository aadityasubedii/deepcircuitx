Comment: 
This block of code represents the part of a synchronous sequential circuit that manipulates the 'data_size' signal, based on clock edge triggers. Upon receiving a positive clock pulse, if the 'reset' signal is asserted, 'data_size' is set to zero, effectively initializing it. Alternatively, when 's_i2c_auto_init' is in states 'AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT' or 'AUTO_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE_1', the 'data_size' is set to 6 and 7 respectively, preparing the system for corresponding data transfer states.
