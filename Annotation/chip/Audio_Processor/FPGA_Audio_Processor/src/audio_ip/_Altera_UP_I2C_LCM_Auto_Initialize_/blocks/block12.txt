Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code controls a state machine for automating initializations on an I2C bus. Transition between states is determined by various signals such as 'finished_auto_init', 'transfer_complete', and 'change_state'. Initially, it checks a "status" state and if initialization is complete, it moves to the "done" state. If not, it proceeds through a sequence of states of sending a start bit, transferring bytes, waiting, sending a stop bit, and incrementing a counter; each guided by conditions in the respective states. After completion, control reverts back to the original "status" state or remains in the "done" state, based on conditions.
