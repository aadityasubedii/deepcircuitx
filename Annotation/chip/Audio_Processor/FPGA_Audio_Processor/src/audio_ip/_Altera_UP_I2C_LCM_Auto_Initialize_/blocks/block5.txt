This block of code is for implementing a counter operation that depends on the state of the system. The counter determines the current ROM address used in the system. A clock-driven event triggers this counter: on each clock cycle, if the system signal for 'reset' is high, the counter reset and the ROM address is set to its minimum value. However, if the system is in the 'AUTO_STATE_6_INCREASE_COUNTER' state, it increments the ROM address counter. Thus, this block aids in navigating through the ROM, either resetting to the initial address or advancing serially.
