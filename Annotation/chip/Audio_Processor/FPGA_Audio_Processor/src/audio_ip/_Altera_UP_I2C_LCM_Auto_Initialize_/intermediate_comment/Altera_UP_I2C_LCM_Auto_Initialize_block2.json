    "block_comment": "The block of code is checking if the `rom_address_counter` has reached its maximum limit, `MAX_ROM_ADDRESS`, indicating that the automatic initialization of ROM has been completed. This is achieved using the `assign` statement in Verilog to continuously compare the `rom_address_counter` with the `MAX_ROM_ADDRESS`. Once they become equal `finished_auto_init` signal is set to TRUE, thus flagging the completion of ROM initialization."
