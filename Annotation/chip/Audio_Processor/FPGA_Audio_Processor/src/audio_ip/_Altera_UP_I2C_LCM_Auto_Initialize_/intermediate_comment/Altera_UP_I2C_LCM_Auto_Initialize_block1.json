    "block_comment": "This block of code is a read-only-memory (ROM) decoder for an LCD. A ROM address counter is decoded to output various data related to the configuration and operation of the LCD, such as input format, power, phase, start positions, contrast and brightness adjustments, voltage levels, and gamma corrections. Data is packed with a 6-bit identifier and predefined constants related to the LCD. It defaults to output zero if the address is not explicitly defined.\n"
