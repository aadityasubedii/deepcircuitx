    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the process of sending a start bit in an I2C data transfer operation. It operates synchronously with the rising edge of the clock. When the system reset signal or the `transfer_complete` signal is high, the `send_start_bit` is reset to zero, effectively stopping the start bit transmission. However, if the system is in the `AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT` state, it sets the `send_start_bit` to high, indicating that a start bit should be sent for data transfer."
