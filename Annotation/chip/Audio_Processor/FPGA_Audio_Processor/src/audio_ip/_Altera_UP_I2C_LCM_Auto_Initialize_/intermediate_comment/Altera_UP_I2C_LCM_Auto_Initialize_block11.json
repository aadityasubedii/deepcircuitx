    "block_comment": "This block of RTL Verilog code is responsible for resetting and assigning digital data outputs based on the state of the I2C bus protocol. If the 'reset' signal is high, the 8-bit 'data_out' is cleared to zero. When the 's_i2c_auto_init' state is at AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT, 'data_out' is assigned 6 bits of data from a ROM chip, enclosed by zero bits on both sides. When the state is AUTO_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE_1, 'data_out' gets the least significant 8 bits of the ROM data. This happens during the positive edge of a clock cycle."
