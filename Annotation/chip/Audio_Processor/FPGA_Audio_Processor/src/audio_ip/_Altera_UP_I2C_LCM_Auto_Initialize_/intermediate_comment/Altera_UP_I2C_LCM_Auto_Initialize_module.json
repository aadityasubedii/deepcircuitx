    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, Altera_UP_I2C_LCM_Auto_Initialize, is responsible for the automatic initialization of an I2C Liquid Crystal Monolithic (LCM) module. It uses specific input and output ports to control and monitor data transmissions as per I2C protocols. The functionality is implemented using a finite state machine depicting different operational states, which starts with 'check status' and ends at 'done'. Internal signals are used to track memory addresses, illustrate current and next states, and indicate the completion of the initialization process. The code includes data handling, error control, and state transitions."
