    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for controlling the send_stop_bit signal in the i2c communication protocol. It is triggered on the rising edge of the clock, and subsequently checks the reset and transfer_complete conditions. If either of these conditions are true, it sets the send_stop_bit to 0 indicating non-transmission of a stop bit. However, if neither condition is met and the state of s_i2c_auto_init is AUTO_STATE_5_SEND_STOP_BIT, it sets send_stop_bit to 1, initiating the transmission of a stop bit in the i2c communication."
