This block of code manages the falling edge detection of a clock signal. It first checks if the reset signal is high, and if so, it sets the 'falling_edge' signal to false. If the reset signal is low, the block calculates the falling edge by checking the change of the clock signal and the phase of the new clock signal using bitwise AND and XOR operations. This is done by comparing the most significant bit of the 'clk_counter' register versus the 'new_clk' signal when 'new_clk' is high.
