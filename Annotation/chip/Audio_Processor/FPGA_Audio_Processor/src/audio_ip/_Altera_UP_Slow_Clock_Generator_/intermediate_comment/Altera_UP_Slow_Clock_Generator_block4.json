    "block_comment": "This always block in Verilog handles the detection of a rising edge clock event. It functions by resetting the 'rising_edge' signal if the reset signal is high and, in other circumstances, uses a bitwise XOR between the most significant bit of 'clk_counter' and the 'new_clk' signal. This is then bitwise ANDed with an inverted 'new_clk' signal to accurately flag a rising edge scenario."
