    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code generates a new clock signal, `new_clk`, based on a counter, `clk_counter`. It is a synchronous design, activated on the rising edge of the system clock `clk`. When a global reset signal, `reset`, is active (logically high), it sets this newly generated clock `new_clk` to LOW. Otherwise, `new_clk` takes the status of the most significant bit of the counter `clk_counter`. Therefore, the frequency of `new_clk` is approximately half of the system clock if `COUNTER_BITS` is set to 1."
