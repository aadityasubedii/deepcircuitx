    "block_comment": "This block of verilog code is used for generating a mid-level active high pulse. The block achieves this by implementing a synchronous reset logic that sets the 'middle_of_high_level' signal to low upon encountering a reset signal. In the absence of a reset signal, the 'middle_of_high_level' signal is determined by a logical AND operation between specific bits of the 'clk_counter' signal."
