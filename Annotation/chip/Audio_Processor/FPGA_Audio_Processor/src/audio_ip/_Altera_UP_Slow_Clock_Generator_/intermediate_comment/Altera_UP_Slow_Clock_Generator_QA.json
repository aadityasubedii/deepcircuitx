It takes in an input clock signal, an enable signal, and an active high reset signal. It uses a counter, which increments on each rising edge of the input clock when enabled, to produce a new slower clock signal (new_clk). Additionally, it generates signals indicating the rising and falling edges of the new clock, along with additional signals indicating the middle of high level and middle of low level. These functionalities provide valuable signals for clock synchronization and events identification in the digital system where this clock generator module is used."

This acts as a counter in the module. On each positive edge of clk, if the enable_clk signal is set to high, then \"clk_counter\" increments by the value of COUNTER_INC.

The most significant bit of this counter is used to generate the \"new_clk\" signal. Other bits are used for generating the \"middle_of_high_level\" and \"middle_of_low_level\" signals. The old and new values of the most significant bit are also used in generating the \"rising_edge\" and \"falling_edge\" signals.
