    "block_comment": "This block is aimed at maintaining a sensitive change in the middle point of a low clock cycle. It works by constantly checking for a positive edge in the input clock. If a reset condition is active, the state of 'middle_of_low_level' is set to zero, indicating the onset of a clock cycle. Otherwise, it sets the 'middle_of_low_level' signal based on a combination of the negation of the highest two bits and an AND operation of all but the last bit in the 'clk_counter'. This clause helps determine the midpoint of a low-level phase in the clock cycle, effectively keeping an account of the flip-flop stage."
