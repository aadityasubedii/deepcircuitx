    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator is a slow clock generator, taking a high-frequency 'clk', 'reset', and 'enable_clk' inputs to generate a slower 'new_clk' output. The operation is controlled by 'clk_counter', a register array which increments per 'clk' pulse if 'enable_clk' is high. Outputs also include 'rising_edge', 'falling_edge', 'middle_of_high_level', and 'middle_of_low_level' signals for clock synchronization and event identification, generated based on the 'clk_counter' status. Separate always blocks are used for each output signal to manage signal transitions. The 'reset' input resets all the output signals and 'clk_counter'."
