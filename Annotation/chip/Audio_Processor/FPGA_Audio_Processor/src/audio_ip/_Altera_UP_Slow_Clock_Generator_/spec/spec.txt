Module name: Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator. 

Module specification: The Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator module serves as a slow clock generator in a digital system. It functions by taking three inputs: 'clk' which is the main clock signal acting as a timing reference, 'reset' which when set to high resets the system to a known initial state, and 'enable_clk' which controls the operation of the clock generator. In response to these inputs, the module generates a slower clock output known as 'new_clk'. Additionally, it produces other output signals such as 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge' which provide necessary information about the transitions of the 'new_clk' signal. 'middle_of_high_level' and 'middle_of_low_level' are two more outputs indicating the middle of high and low levels of the 'new_clk' signal. These signals can prove to be crucial in the mitigation of clock skew issues. 

Internally, the module utilizes a register array named 'clk_counter', which acts as a counter. This counter increments by the value of 'COUNTER_INC' on each rising edge of 'clk' when the 'enable_clk' signal is set to high. 'clk_counter' plays a fundamental role in this module as it controls the generation of 'new_clk', 'rising_edge', 'falling_edge', 'middle_of_high_level', and 'middle_of_low_level' signals thus dictating the clock rate of the output slower clock and the timing of the other output signals. 

The Verilog code is organized into different blocks, each serving a specific function. There are separate sections dedicated to defining the parameters, inputs, and outputs of the module. There are also 'always' blocks for each signal that are executed each time there's a rising edge at 'clk'. Each 'always' block contains the logic for computing the values of the associated signal based on the current state of the system and the incoming inputs. Finally, the module ends with the 'endmodule' keyword indicating the end of the Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator module.
