Module-level comment: The 'clock_generator' module is a phase-locked loop-based clock generator specifically designed for an audio system. It accepts a reference clock (`CLOCK_27`) and a reset signal, and it provides an output clock (`AUD_XCK`) with frequency controlled by parameters AUD_CLK_DIV and AUD_CLK_MULT. The lock status of the PLL is indicated by `audio_clk_locked`. The module employs an altpll function and extensively uses `defparam` for defining allocation and operational parameters. The codes are organized to have clear delineation of inputs, outputs, internal signals, and PLL configuration.
