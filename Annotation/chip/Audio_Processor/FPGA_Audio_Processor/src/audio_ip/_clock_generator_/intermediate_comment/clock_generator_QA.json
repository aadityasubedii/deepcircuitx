It uses an altpll (Phase Locked Loop) function to stabilize and adjust the frequency of the clock signal. This module takes in an input CLOCK_27 and a reset signal and generates an audio clock output (AUD_XCK). It contains parameters for clock divider (AUD_CLK_DIV) and clock multiplier (AUD_CLK_MULT) to achieve the desired output clock frequency. The 'locked' output is used to indicate whether the PLL has locked onto the input signal. A majority of the ports in module are unused as indicated by parameters defined at the end."

It's likely used to reset the functionality of the system or the PLL.\n\nExplanation: The input signals are used to control the PLL behaviour inside the module. For instance, `CLOCK_27` acts as a reference clock source, and `reset` helps to bring the system to a known, fresh state.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. `AUD_XCK`: This is the output of the module which provides the clock signal output, specifically for the audio system.\n\n2. `audio_clk_locked`: This is another output that indicates whether the PLL has achieved lock status. It gets its value from the `locked` output of the altpll function.\n\nExplanation: The primary output `AUD_XCK` serves as a generated clock needed for related systems (like an audio system). The `audio_clk_locked` indicates the lock status of the PLL which can provide important feedback about the operation status of the clock generation process."
