This block of code manages the read space of the Right Audio FIFO(First-In-First-Out) buffer. At the rising edge of the clock, the code checks for a reset signal and if the reset signal is high, the right audio FIFO read space is set to 0. Otherwise, the code sets the most significant bit (MSB) of the right audio FIFO read space to the status of the right channel FIFO being full and the other bits to the amount of space used in the right channel FIFO.
