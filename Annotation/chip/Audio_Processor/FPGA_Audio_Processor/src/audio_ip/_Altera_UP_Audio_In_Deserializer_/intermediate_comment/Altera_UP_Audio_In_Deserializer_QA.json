It takes serial audio input, maintains a bit-count, and manages two sync FIFOs (First-In-First-Out) buffers for the left and right audio channels. \n\nThe module uses edge triggering of various clocks and a reset signal to synchronize and control the operations smoothly. It takes in the serial audio data, shifts it into a register, and based on the left-right clock signals, pushes this data into either the left or right audio FIFOs that act as buffers. \n\nThe module also monitors and outputs the available read space in both left and right audio FIFOs and provides output data from the left and right audio channels. In essence, this module facilitates the necessary conversion and buffering required for handling serialized stereo audio data in a computational system."
