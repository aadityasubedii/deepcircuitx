    "block_comment": "The purpose of the block is to manage digital audio data input. It integrates a shift register arrangement for the data in response to a positive edge clock signal. If a reset signal is triggered, the data input shift register is filled with zeros. Alternatively, if a bit clock rising edge appears and valid audio input is present, the shift register is updated. The newest serial audio input data is stacked onto the far right of the shift register, while the existing data shifts one bit to the left with the most significant bit discarded."
