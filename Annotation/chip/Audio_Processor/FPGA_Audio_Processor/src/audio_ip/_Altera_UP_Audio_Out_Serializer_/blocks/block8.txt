Comment: 
This block of code manages the read status of the left audio channel. At every positive edge of the clock, if a reset signal is detected, the flag "left_channel_was_read" is reset indicating the left audio channel was not read. If a "read_left_channel" signal is asserted, it sets the flag "left_channel_was_read" indicating that the left audio channel was read. However, if the "read_right_channel" signal is asserted, it resets the "left_channel_was_read" flag back to 0, indicating the left audio channel was not read again.
