Comment: 
This block represents a Synchronous FIFO buffer implemented using Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO for the left audio channel. The FIFO is clocked by 'clk' and can be reset with the 'reset' signal. Writing to the FIFO is enabled with 'left_channel_data_en' signal, only when the FIFO is not full. The 'left_channel_data' signal is used for writing data into the FIFO. The 'read_left_channel' signal enables reading from the FIFO. The block outputs 'left_channel_fifo_is_empty' and 'left_channel_fifo_is_full' signals showing the status of the FIFO, 'left_channel_fifo_used' representing the word count in the FIFO, and 'left_channel_from_fifo' signal which outputs the data read from the FIFO.
