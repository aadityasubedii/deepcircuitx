    "block_comment": "This block is a space counter for the right channel FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure in a digital system that gets updated on the rising edge of the clock signal. If a reset signal is detected, the space counter (`right_channel_fifo_write_space`) is reset to 0. If not, it is updated based on the state of the FIFO; the binary value 0x80 is subtracted from the concatenation of FIFO full flag (`right_channel_fifo_is_full`) and the number of used spaces in the FIFO (`right_channel_fifo_used`). This effectively calculates the remaining space in the FIFO."
