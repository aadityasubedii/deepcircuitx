    "block_comment": "This block defines the parameters for the Audio_Out_Left_Channel_FIFO module in Verilog. Specifically, it sets the width and depth of the data it will handle, and the width of the address needed for these data to be processed and stored. The data width is set to AUDIO_DATA_WIDTH, the data depth is defined as 128 indicating the maximum amount of data it can hold at a time, and the address width is set to 7 bits which determines the number of unique memory locations it can access."
