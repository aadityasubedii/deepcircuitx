    "block_comment": "This block of code sets parameters for the Audio_Out_Right_Channel_FIFO module in Verilog. The parameters specify the data width, data depth, and address width of the FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer associated with the audio output for the right channel. The specified data width represents the bit-width of the data that the FIFO can store. The data depth defines the total number of data elements that the FIFO can hold, set here as 128. The address width, set to 7, defines the total number of distinct addresses available in the memory, allowing for a total of 2^7 different addressable locations."
