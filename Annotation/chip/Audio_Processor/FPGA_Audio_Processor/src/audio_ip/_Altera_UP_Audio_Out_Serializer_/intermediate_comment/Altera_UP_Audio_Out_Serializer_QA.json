It receives audio data - left channel and right channel input. The data is written into two separate FIFOs (First In First Out memory) provided by the Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO instances - one for the left audio channel and one for the right audio channel. The write process into each FIFO occurs when it is not full, and the relevant _channel_data_en signal is active. The read from the FIFOs happens in sync with left_right_clk_ rising and falling edges, provided neither of the FIFOs is empty. The read data is loaded into a shift register data_out_shift_reg, which then gets serially shifted out with every falling edge of bit_clk. The serialized output data is taken from the MSB of the shift register. The module also gives the status of how much write space is available in both the left channel FIFO and the right channel FIFO."
