    "block_comment": "This block assigns the output `read_right_channel` based on the conditions of two input signals, `left_right_clk_falling_edge` and `left_channel_was_read`. The implementation uses a bitwise AND operator, resulting in `read_right_channel` being true only if both the `left_right_clk_falling_edge` and `left_channel_was_read` signals are true, meaning a falling (i.e., high to low) transition in left-right clock is detected and the left audio channel was read."
