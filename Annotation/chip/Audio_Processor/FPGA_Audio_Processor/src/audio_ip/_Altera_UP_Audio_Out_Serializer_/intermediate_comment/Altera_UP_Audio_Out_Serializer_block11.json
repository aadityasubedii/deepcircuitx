    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the write space of a left channel FIFO buffer. At the rising edge of the clock signal, if the reset signal is high, the write space for the FIFO is reset to '0'. Otherwise, the write space is updated based on the buffer's full status and the amount of space already used."
