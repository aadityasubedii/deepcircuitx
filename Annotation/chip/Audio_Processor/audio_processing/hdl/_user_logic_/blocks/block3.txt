This block of code processes a two-dimensional data_out array and repopulates mem_data_out array accordingly. Leveraging the nested loop construct, it iterates over each 'memory' and each 'byte lane' within this 'memory'. Within these loops, the desired segment (8 bits, representing a byte) of the mem_data_out array is extracted using a bit slice operation, and is updated with corresponding value from the data_out array. The bit slice operation on mem_data_out is index-controlled, which allows dynamic selection of the byte position based on the iterator 'byte_index'.
