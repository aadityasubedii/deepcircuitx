The block of code function is to read data from a multiple memory lanes and assign it to output datasets, according to an input address. This is accomplished using a nested for loop: the outer loop iterates over each memory lane (determined by the constant C_NUM_MEM); the inner loop cycles through each byte within these lanes (based on the constant NUM_BYTE_LANES). The data read from each lane (defined by the read_address and byte_index) is assigned to corresponding indices within the data_out 2D array.
