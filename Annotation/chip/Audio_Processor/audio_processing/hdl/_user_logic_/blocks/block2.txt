This block of code in Verilog is functioning as a multiplexer for selecting memory data based on the `mem_select` signal. The `always` block is event-triggered whenever the `mem_select` signal changes. It uses a case statement to determine which output to assign to `mem_ip2bus_data`. If `mem_select` equals 1, it accesses the first index of the `mem_data_out` and assigns it to `mem_ip2bus_data`. For any other value of `mem_select`, it assigns 0 to `mem_ip2bus_data` as default.
