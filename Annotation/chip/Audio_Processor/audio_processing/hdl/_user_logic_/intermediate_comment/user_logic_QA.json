The user_logic module communicates with other modules or peripherals via standard bus interfaces such as Bus2IP and IP2Bus. It captures address, data, and control signals from the bus interface, processes the data in certain ways (here FFT), and then sets up data and status information for return to the bus interface. Inputs are written into a memory model and an FFT operation is performed using the 'fft_wrapper' instance. The output is stored back into memory. The module handles read and write requests and acknowledges, and provides the transformed data when read operations are requested."
