    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a delay element for memory read acknowledgment with reset functionality. Upon each rising edge of Bus2IP_Clk, the system checks if Bus2IP_Resetn is at low (0) level, in which case it sets both mem_read_ack_dly1 and mem_read_ack_dly2 to 0, effectively acting as a reset. If not, it sets mem_read_ack_dly1 to the value of mem_read_enable (signifies that a memory read operation is enabled), and mem_read_ack_dly2 takes up the value of mem_read_ack_dly1 in the next clock cycle, hence introducing a delay."
