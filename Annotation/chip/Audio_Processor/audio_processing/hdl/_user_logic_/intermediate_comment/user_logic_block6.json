    "block_comment": "This block controls writing data to memory. It iterates over all memory slots and byte lanes, establishing write permissions by pairing the memory slot with the corresponding byte enable signal, and storing incoming bus data corresponding to the appropriate byte lane. The byte index is used to specify the range of incoming bus data to be stored."
