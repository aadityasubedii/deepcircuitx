    "block_comment": "This block handles writing to and reading from a memory system in a Verilog RTL code. It is activated at the positive edge of a clock signal. For every clock cycle, it loops over each memory unit (C_NUM_MEM) and for each byte lane within those memory units (NUM_BYTE_LANES). If the write enable for a specific memory unit and byte lane is set to 1, data is written from 'data_in' to the 'INPUT' memory at the given 'mem_address'. Regardless of whether data is written, the 'mem_address' is set as the 'read_address' for subsequent operations."
