Module-level comment: This 'user_logic' module performs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations and communicates with other modules via bus interfaces. It uses bus inputs to receive data, handles this data based on its address and control signals, processes it through an FFT wrapper, and sends the resultant output back to the bus interface. Internally, it maintains synchronization, manages memory read/write operations, transfers prepared data to the FFT unit, retrieves FFT output, and manages data addressing. Its main blocks handle memory interfacing, FFT computation, and communication control.
