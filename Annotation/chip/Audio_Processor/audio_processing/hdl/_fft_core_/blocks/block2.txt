The block of code serves as an initialization process for the digital logic system. It achieves its purpose by firstly setting both the GSR_int and PRLD_int signals to a high value (1'b1) which typically represents an active state in a system. It then waits for a specified period of time represented by ROC_WIDTH before deactivating these signals by setting them to a low value (1'b0). This block is often incorporated at the beginning of systems to configure initial conditions and ensure system stability during startup.
