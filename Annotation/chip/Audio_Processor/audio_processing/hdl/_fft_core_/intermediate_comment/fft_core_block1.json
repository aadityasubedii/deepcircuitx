    "block_comment": "The initial block in this code initially sets the GTS_int signal to logic high. After a delay defined by TOC_WIDTH in time units, it resets GTS_int to logic low. This emulates a timed on-off behavior used often in simulation before the start of a protocol to maintain design integrity and setup."
