    "spec": "Module name: fft_wrapper. \n\nModule specification: The module fft_wrapper is designed to act as a wrapper for a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) core. The functionality of this module is to receive a complex signal input, control the FFT core to transform the signal, and output the magnitude of the transformed signal. \n\nThe input ports for the fft_wrapper are 'clk', 'start', 'unload', 'xn_re', 'xn_im', 'fwd_inv', and 'fwd_inv_we'. The 'clk' signal synchronizes the system. The 'start' signal triggers the FFT computation and 'unload' controls the data unloading from the FFT core. The 'xn_re' and 'xn_im' represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex signal input to the FFT core, respectively. 'fwd_inv' is a control signal for selecting forward or inverse FFT and 'fwd_inv_we' is the write enable input for 'fwd_inv'. \n\nThe output ports are 'xn_index', 'Magnitude', and 'xk_index'. The 'xn_index' and 'xk_index' signals provide the ordering/indexing of input and output complex numbers in the FFT core. The 'Magnitude' port outputs the magnitude of the FFT result.\n\nInternally, the module leverages several signals including 'dv', 'rfd', 'busy', 'done', 'edone', 'xk_re', 'xk_im', 'blk_exp', 'temp_re', 'temp_im', and 'mag_out'. Signals like 'dv', 'rfd', 'busy', 'done', and 'edone' are used to validate, synchronize and control the data flow and the FFT computation operation. On the other hand, 'xk_re', 'xk_im', 'temp_re', 'temp_im', and 'mag_out' are used in the computation of the magnitude of the FFT output.\n\nWithin the code, two major blocks can be distinguished. The 'fft_core' is an instantiated module for performing the FFT computation, and an 'always' block is being used to perform the magnitude calculation whenever a new valid output is available from the FFT core.",
