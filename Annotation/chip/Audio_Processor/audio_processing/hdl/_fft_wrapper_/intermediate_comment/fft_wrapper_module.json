    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, fft_wrapper, is a wrapper for an FFT core and handles FFT computation on input complex signals. It uses control signals ('start', 'unload', 'fwd_inv') to manipulate the FFT core operations. The input complex signals 'xn_re', 'xn_im' are passed to the FFT core and the transformed result is received as 'xk_re', 'xk_im'. An 'always' block computes the squared magnitude of the transformed result whenever new data is available, indicated by 'dv'. Finally, the magnitude value is output through the 'Magnitude' port."
