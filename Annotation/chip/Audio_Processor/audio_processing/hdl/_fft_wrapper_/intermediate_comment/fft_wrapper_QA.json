FFT is an algorithm for the computation of discrete Fourier transforms in a very efficient manner, it is generally used for signal processing and data analysis. In this code, this module takes a real and imaginary part of a complex signal as input, which is processed in the FFT core, and outputs the magnitude of the resulting transformed signal. The FFT core computation can be controlled using \"start\", \"unload\", and \"fwd_inv\" signals."
