    "spec": "Module name: picoblaze. \n\nModule specification: The module \"picoblaze\" represents an embedded microcontroller architecture based on the PicoBlaze design. The Verilog code signifies the signal relations between the microcontroller core 'kcpsm6' and the ROM memory 'myprogram2' where the application code resides. The module works on managing I/O interactions, processing interrupts, and addressing of the program memory. The module has several input ports: \"in_port\" (8-bit data transfer mechanism), \"interrupt\" (interrupt signal), \"reset\" (system reset signal), and \"clk\" (clock signal for synchronization). The output ports include: \"port_id\" (8-bit I/O port ID), \"read_strobe\" and \"write_strobe\" (control signals for I/O operations), \"out_port\" (8-bit output data transfer line), and \"interrupt_ack\" (interrupt acknowledge signal). Internal signals include \"cpu_reset\" (signal to reset the microcontroller's state), \"pb_sleep\" (signal keeping the microcontroller continuously awake), \"address\" (a 12-bit address signal for interfacing with memory), \"instruction\" (a 18-bit data signal presumably holding the fetched instruction), and \"bram_enable\" (enabling signal for Block RAM operations). The design is mainly divided into sections defining the core PicoBlaze microcontroller and ROM memory with functionalities of data processing and instruction storing respectively.",
