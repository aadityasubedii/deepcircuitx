Module-level comment: The 'audio_effects' handles audio processing based on given control signals. It uses 'audio_input' as data, 'volume_control' to adjust volume, and commands via a 'control' signal. Value is stored in 'last_sample' at 'sample_end'. During 'sample_req', the module processes 'last_sample' with volume control or a sine lookup table 'romdata', or outputs a zero, based on the 'control' signal status. Processed data is output via 'audio_output'. This all syncs with the 'clk' edge.
