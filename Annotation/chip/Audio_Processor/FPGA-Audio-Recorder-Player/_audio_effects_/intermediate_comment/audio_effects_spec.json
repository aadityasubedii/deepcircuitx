    "spec": "Module name: audio_effects. \n\nModule specification: The audio_effects module operates on the positive edge of an input clock signal, processing audio data based on control signals and volume control parameters. The module accepts an audio data sample on its 16-bit 'audio_input' port. The processing happens when the 'sample_req' signal is active, nominating the sample for processing. Another input 'sample_end' indicates the end of an audio sample. The volume is controlled by a 2-bit 'volume_control' input. The module functions are dictated by a 4-bit 'control' signal. The audio_effects module outputs the processed audio data on a 16-bit 'audio_output' port.\n\nInternally, the module uses a register 'romdata' as a look-up table to simulate sine waveform and the 'index' register for indexing this table. Another internal register 'last_sample' holds the last audio sample received when 'sample_end' is active, while register 'dat' stores the processed data value which is directly linked to the 'audio_output'. \n\nThe module has an initial block to initialize the romdata look-up table with pre-defined sine waveform values. The 'always' block of the module processes the audio data and digital effects based on the 'control' signal. If 'FEEDBACK' control is active, the last received audio sample multiplied by volume control is used. If the 'SINE' control is active, the output is fetched from the 'romdata' look-up table. When neither 'SINE' nor 'FEEDBACK' are active, it outputs a zero.",

When this is active, the current 'audio_input' is stored in 'last_sample'.\n3. sample_req: This signal requests the processing of the next audio sample. When this is active, the 'dat' output value is calculated based on the control signals status.\n4. volume_control: This is a 2-bit input that controls the volume level during feedback operation. It's used to multiply the 'last_sample'.\n5. audio_input: This is a 16-bit input port that provides the audio sample data to the module.\n6. control: This 4-bit port provides the control signal. If 'FEEDBACK' is active, it uses 'last_sample' and 'volume_control' for 'dat', otherwise, if 'SINE' is active, it provides data from the 'romdata' look-up table.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. audio_output: This is a 16-bit output port that delivers the processed audio data from the module.

It is initialized with pre-defined values in the initial block which replicates a sine waveform. It is used to multiply with the 'last_sample' value when the SINE control is active.\n\n2. index: It is a 7-bit signal, initially set to '0'. The 'index' is used to select an element from the romdata look-up table. If the SINE control is active, the index increments by one in each clock cycle until it reaches the maximum value of 99, then it goes back to zero, making it go through the 'romdata' sine look-up values cyclically.\n\n3. last_sample: This is a 16-bit signal that holds the last received audio sample whenever the 'sample_end' signal is active. If the FEEDBACK control is active, 'dat' is assigned to 'last_sample' times 'volume_control'.\n\n4. dat: This 16-bit signal is assigned to the 'audio_output'.

The module accepts an audio data sample on its 16-bit 'audio_input' port. The processing happens when the 'sample_req' signal is active, nominating the sample for processing. Another input 'sample_end' indicates the end of an audio sample. The volume is controlled by a 2-bit 'volume_control' input. The module functions are dictated by a 4-bit 'control' signal. The audio_effects module outputs the processed audio data on a 16-bit 'audio_output' port.\n\nInternally, the module uses a register 'romdata' as a look-up table to simulate sine waveform and the 'index' register for indexing this table. Another internal register 'last_sample' holds the last audio sample received when 'sample_end' is active, while register 'dat' stores the processed data value which is directly linked to the 'audio_output'. \n\nThe module has an initial block to initialize the romdata look-up table with pre-defined sine waveform values. The 'always' block of the module processes the audio data and digital effects based on the 'control' signal. If 'FEEDBACK' control is active, the last received audio sample multiplied by volume control is used. If the 'SINE' control is active, the output is fetched from the 'romdata' look-up table. When neither 'SINE' nor 'FEEDBACK' are active, it outputs a zero."
