Comment: 
This Verilog block defines a flip flop ("uart_rx6_1") that acts as a digital memory cell. It uses an FDR (Flip Flop with D input and asynchronous reset) module, and captures the value of `pointer_value[2]` at the rising edge of the clock (`clk`). If `buffer_reset` is high, the flip flop resets, clearing its content.
