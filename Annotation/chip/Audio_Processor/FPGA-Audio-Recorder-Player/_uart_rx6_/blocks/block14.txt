This block is a Look-Up Table (LUT) for a UART receiver module. The LUT transforms incoming data and control signals into a specific output data value. The block implementation uses a 6-input 2-output LUT that is initialized with pre-defined bit patterns. For its inputs, it takes the 6th and 7th bits of the data, a stop bit signal, a sample input signal, a run signal, and a static high signal. The transformed output is stored in the 6th bit of the data value.
