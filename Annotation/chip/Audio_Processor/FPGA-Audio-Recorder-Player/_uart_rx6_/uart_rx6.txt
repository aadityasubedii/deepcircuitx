Module-level comment: The uart_rx6 module is a UART receiver, designed to receive and process serial data. It utilizes an enable signal 'en_16_x_baud' to sample incoming data precisely. It has a buffer, managed by 'buffer_read', 'buffer_write' and 'buffer_reset' signals, where data is temporarily stored, and indicators for data presence and buffer state. Internally, it handles data sampling, start and stop bit detection, data shifting, and clock divisor generation for baud rate. With extensive use of lookup tables (LUTs) and flip-flops, it controls state transitions and data flow.
