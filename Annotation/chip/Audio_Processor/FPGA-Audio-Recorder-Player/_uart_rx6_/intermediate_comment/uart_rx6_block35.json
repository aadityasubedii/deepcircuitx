    "block_comment": "This block accomplishes the function of a Look-Up Table (LUT) in a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter), specifically tailored for a 6-input to 2-output scenario (labelled as \"uart_rx6_1\"). It uses a predefined hexadecimal value count (INIT parameter listed as the constant value 64'hCC9060CCAA5050AA) to determine the table's output based on the 6 input parameters (I0 to I5). It attaches various indexes from a pointer and buffer actions as inputs, with '1' connected to I5 as a constant input. The two outputs O5 and O6 are assembled in the array pointer_value[0] and pointer_value[1] respectively."
