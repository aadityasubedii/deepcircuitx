    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a part of a UART receiver module. The block itself is a 6-input, 2-output lookup table (LUT6_2) used as part of the data processing within the UART receiver. Input signals include data bits (data[2]-data[4]) from the received data stream, a sample input which could be a system clock or control signal, and a 'run' signal to control the operation of the LUT. The LUT6_2 functionally generates two output bits (data_value[2]-data_value[3]), by making use of a pre-defined INIT pattern ('F0CCFFFFCCAAFFFF') representing the transformation of input to output."
