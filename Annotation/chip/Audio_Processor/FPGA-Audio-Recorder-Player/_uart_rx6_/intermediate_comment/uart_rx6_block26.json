    "block_comment": "This block acts as a UART receiver that responds to incoming bit changes by generating corresponding output signals. The module uses a lookup table (specifically, a LUT6_2 lookup table), to determine the correct output states based on a set of six inputs including the stop bit, sample rate, sample input status and the initial value of the incoming data. The INIT attribute suggests that the lookup table is pre-configured with 64 hexadecimal entries. When the status of the 'run' bit changes and the most significant byte of 'data' (i.e., data[0]) is 1, the lookup table is triggered to provide one output value each for the stop bit and the input buffer."
