    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a flip-flop component related to a UART receiver (`uart_rx6_2`). It primarily handles the reception (input) of the 4th bit (`data_value[3]`) of the input data stream. Its implementation is straightforward: the received bit, `data_value[3]`, is latched onto the flip-flop 'D' input, and the output 'Q' reflects this latched value as `data[3]`. Simultaneously, the flip-flop synchronises the operation with the main system clock signal (`clk`)."
