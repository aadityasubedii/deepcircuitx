    "block_comment": "This block describes a Look-Up Table (LUT) functionality in a UART receiver design. The 6-input LUT (LUT6_2) is mapped to various inputs including data bits and control signals. It uses a 64-bit initialization value to determine the output mapping of input combinations. Input bits data[4], data[5], and data[6] represent the incoming serial data, 'sample_input' is the sampled input value, 'run' likely signifies if the UART is active, and the last input is hardwired to 1. The output values data_value[4] and data_value[5] provide the resulting transformation of the combined inputs."
