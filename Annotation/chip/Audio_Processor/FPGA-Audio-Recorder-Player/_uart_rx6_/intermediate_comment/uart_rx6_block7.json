    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a Lookup Table (LUT) in a Verilog RTL code for a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART). The purpose of this specific LUT, called 'div01_lut', is to determine the divisor values needed for the baud rate setting of the UART, based on the input signals. The LUT uses six inputs: 'div[0]', 'div[1]', 'en_16_x_baud', 'run', and two constant high signals. The outputs, 'div_value[0]' and 'div_value[1]', are determined by the logic encoded in the initialization architecture (with a hexadecimal value of '64'h6C0000005A000000')."
