    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is part of a UART receiver that handles data storage. The block generates an array of SRL16E shift registers, with each register corresponding to a bit in an 8-bit data word. This array of shift registers functions as a circular buffer, with `data[i]` as the data input, and `buffer_write` as the control signal determining when to shift input data into the buffer. The `pointer[3:0]` bits are used to select which bit of the shift-register array to read out to `data_out[i]`. The block utilizes a Verilog generate loop to instantiate eight shift registers for the 8-bit data word."
