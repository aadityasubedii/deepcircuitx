    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a Flip-Flop instantiation which plays a crucial role in a UART receiver logic. This block is specifically responsible for delaying the sample value and synchronizing it with the given clock signal. The 'FD' module depicts a D-Flip Flop in which 'D' (Data input) is mapped to 'sample_dly_value' (input), 'Q' (Output) to 'sample_dly' (output), and 'C' (Clock input) to 'clk' (input). This synchronization ensures the accurate reading of bits in reception logic, protecting against timing inconsistencies or signal noise."
