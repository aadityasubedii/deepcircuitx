    "block_comment": "This block of code is part of a UART receiver implementation, specifically a positive-edge triggered D-type flip-flop (FD). The flip-flop is used for data sampling and synchronization, which is fundamental to UART communication. It receives an input signal (D) as 'div_value[1]' and generates an output signal (Q) as 'div[1]'. The function HBLKNM indicates the block name, in this case \"uart_rx6_3\", which helps in debugging and identification. This block is straightforward but critical in digital communication designs for handling data within the serial communication process.\n"
