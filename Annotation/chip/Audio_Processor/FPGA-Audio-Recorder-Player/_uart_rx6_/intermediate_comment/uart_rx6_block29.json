    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a six-input Look-up table (LUT) for a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) receiver. The functionality is customizable by setting the 64-bit .INIT parameter. It takes 'serial_in', 'sample', 'sample_dly' and 'en_16_x_baud' as inputs and gives 'sample_value' and 'sample_dly_value' as outputs. This is achieved by using a LUT6_2 model from Xilinx designs, which supports complex functionalities by specifying a 64-bit mask that acts as a truth table."
