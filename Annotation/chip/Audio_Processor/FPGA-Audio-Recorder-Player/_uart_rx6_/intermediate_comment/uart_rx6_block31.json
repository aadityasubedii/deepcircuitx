    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a flip-flop for buffering received UART data. The 'data_present_value' and 'buffer_reset' signals are used as the data input and reset respectively, while 'clk' is the clock input. The output of the flip flop is 'data_present_int' which is used to indicate internally if data is present or not. The flip flop acts on the rising edge of the clock and is reset when 'buffer_reset' goes high, ensuring that the 'data_present_int' signal is accurate even across clock cycles."
