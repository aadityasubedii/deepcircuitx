    "block_comment": "This block performs the function of a flip-flop under the alias \"uart_rx6_3\". It is used here to sample an input value. Specifically, the input value named \"sample_input_value\" gets latched on the rising edge of the clock (\"clk\"), and the latched value is carried on the output (\"sample_input\"). This D flip-flop instantiation ensures that the input value is synchronously sampled and propagated, contributing to the overall operational stability of the system. Please refer to the full code for the broader application of this block."
