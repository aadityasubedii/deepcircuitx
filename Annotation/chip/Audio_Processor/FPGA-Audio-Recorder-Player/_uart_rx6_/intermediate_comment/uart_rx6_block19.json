    "block_comment": "This block is a part of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) receiver functioning as a data flipping section for the 3rd bit of the received data. It employs a D type flip-flop (FD component named as data2_flop) to handle this task. The input (named 'D') to the flip-flop is the 3rd bit of the incoming data (data_value[2]). The output (named 'Q') is the processed 3rd bit which is read as data[2]. The flip-flop operation is clock controlled as indicated by the clock ('C') input connected to the 'clk' signal.\n"
