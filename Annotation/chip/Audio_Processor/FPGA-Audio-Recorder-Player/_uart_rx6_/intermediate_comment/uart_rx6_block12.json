    "block_comment": "The block of code functions as a flip-flop for the 7th bit of incoming UART data. The block uses a D-type flip-flop (FD), a basic type of flip-flop that takes an input ('D') and a clock signal ('C'). Upon each rising edge of the clock signal, the value provided to the 'D' input is transferred to the output ('Q'). The value to be latched is given by 'data_value[7]', which represents the 7th bit of the data value. The flip-flop is clocked by 'clk', so the 7th bit of the data value is captured and made available on 'data[7]' at each rising edge of the clock."
