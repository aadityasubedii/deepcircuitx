    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a flip-flop for a UART receiver using FDR primitive. The function of the block is to store the bit from the pointer_value[0] upon receiving a clock pulse, then forward this bit to the pointer[0] if buffer_reset is not activated. It's implemented using the FDR (Flip-Flop with Data and Reset) primitive, taking pointer_value[0], the clock signal (clk) and a reset signal (buffer_reset) as inputs. The stored bit is available at the output node (pointer[0])."
