    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a Look-Up Table (LUT) in a UART receiver block that determines the value of the start bit. The implemented LUT uses a 6-input function detailed by the `.INIT` attribute set to a constant value. It takes in inputs `start_bit`, `sample_input`, `sample_dly`, `sample`, `run`, and a constant `1'b1` (indicating an active high bit). The output, `start_bit_value`, is updated based on these inputs according to the mapping specified by the initial attribute of the LUT."
