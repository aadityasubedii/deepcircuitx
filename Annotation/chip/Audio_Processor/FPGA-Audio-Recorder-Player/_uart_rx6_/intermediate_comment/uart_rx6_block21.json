    "block_comment": "The block, designated as \"uart_rx6_2\", serves as a flip-flop for data input. It captures and holds the input 'data_value' at the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'. The implementation uses a 'FD' type flip-flop where the data input 'D' is 'data_value[1]' and the data output 'Q' is 'data[1]'. The clock input 'C' controls when the data is sampled and held determined by 'clk'."
