The purpose of such a module is to receive serial data, interpret and process it for further use. It handles various tasks such as detecting start and stop bits, reading data samples, storing data in buffer, etc. The buffer here is implemented as a shift register and using some conditions and flip-flops, this module manages when to write data to the buffer or when to read data from it. It also provides indications when the buffer is half full, full and when data is present in it. The data rate is determined by the 'en_16_x_baud' input which is used to generate clock divisors."
