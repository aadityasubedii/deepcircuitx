    "block_comment": "This block defines a flip-flop named \"start_bit_flop\" used within a UART receiver module (\"uart_rx6_4\"). It is a crucial part of the UART receiver's asynchronous design that is used to capture the start bit of the incoming data. The D input to the flip-flop represents the current start bit value (start_bit_value), while the Q output (start_bit) represents the captured and latched start bit. The clock (clk) signal controls the timing of the data capture, updating the start bit when it transitions. The function \"FD\" itself represents a D Flip-Flop block, a standard element of digital circuit design.\n"
