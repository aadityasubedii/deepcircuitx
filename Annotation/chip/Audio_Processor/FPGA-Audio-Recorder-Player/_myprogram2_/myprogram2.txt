Module-level comment: 
/**
 * Instruction memory module for a PicoBlaze-style processor.
 * Implements a 4K x 18-bit ROM using four RAMB16BWER primitives.
 * Takes 12-bit address input, outputs 18-bit instruction.
 * Uses LUT6_2 components for data multiplexing from memory blocks.
 * Includes address routing, pipelining, and memory initialization.
