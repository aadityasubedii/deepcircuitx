Module name: myprogram2. Module specification: This module implements an instruction memory for a PicoBlaze-style processor, capable of storing 4096 18-bit instructions. It takes a 12-bit address input, an enable signal, and a clock input, and outputs an 18-bit instruction. The module uses four Xilinx RAMB16BWER primitives to implement the memory, with LUT6_2 components used for multiplexing the data from different memory blocks. Internal signals include address lines, data lines, and control signals for both ports of the memory blocks, though only port A is actively used. The module is divided into several sections: input/output port declarations, internal signal declarations, address and data routing logic, a flip-flop for pipelining the most significant address bit, LUT-based multiplexers for instruction output, and four instantiations of RAMB16
