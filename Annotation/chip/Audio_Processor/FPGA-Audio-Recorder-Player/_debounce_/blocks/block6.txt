Comment: 
This block performs the task of synchronous operation between two variables, sync_1 and sync_0, based on the rising edge of the clock signal. The variable 'sync_1' is made to follow the value of 'sync_0' every time there is a positive edge in the clock signal, ensuring synchronization between the two variables in the digital system.
