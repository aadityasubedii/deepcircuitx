Electrical bounce can cause a single press to look like multiple presses, leading to a wide range of unintended behaviors. This code essentially debounces the input signal 'i_btn'.\n\nThis is achieved by synchronizing the input signal ('i_btn') with two flip-flops in series (sync_0, sync_1), which are driven by a common clock ('clk'). A counter is incremented if there is a non-matching value between the last registered input and current state (idle). When the counter reaches the maximum value (max), the output state ('o_state') is toggled. At the same time, either 'o_ondn' or 'o_onup' output signals are updated depending on the current state, only if the counter has also reached its maximum and idle is false. These could indicate the moments of state change. In between button press or release, the counter is reset to zero."
