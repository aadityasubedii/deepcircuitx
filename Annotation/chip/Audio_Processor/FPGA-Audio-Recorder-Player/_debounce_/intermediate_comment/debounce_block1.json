    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to control the output signal `o_onup` based on specific conditions. The `o_onup` output is set high when the system is not idle (indicated by the `~idle` bit), reaches its maximum limit (`max`), and is in a certain operational state (`o_state`). This is accomplished using the bitwise AND operator `&`, which returns high if every bit of the operands is high and low otherwise. The tilde operator `~` is used to invert the `idle` signal, thereby ensuring `o_onup` is high when the system is active."
