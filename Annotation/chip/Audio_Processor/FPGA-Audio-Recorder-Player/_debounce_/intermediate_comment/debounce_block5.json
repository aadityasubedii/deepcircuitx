    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code defines a wire called 'idle' that indicates whether a system is in the 'sync_1' state or not. It does this by comparing the current state of the system (represented by 'o_state') to 'sync_1'. If the 'o_state' is equal to 'sync_1', the 'idle' wire is set to 1 (true), indicating that the system is idle; otherwise, it is set to 0 (false), indicating that the system is not idle. This 'idle' wire can then be used in other parts of the code to conditionalize behavior based on whether the system is idle or not."
