    "module": "Module-level comment: The debounce module effectively filters noisy signals from hardware switches through synchronization and counter mechanics. 'i_btn' synchronization is facilitated using 'sync_0' and 'sync_1' alongside the 'clk' signal. An internal 'counter' increments with each 'clk' cycle when 'i_btn' and 'o_state' mismatch, and resets when they match, denoted by signal 'idle'. When the 'counter' reaches its peak (signified by 'max'), 'o_state' toggles, providing a debounced signal. 'o_ondn' and 'o_onup' are additional outputs indicating state change moments."
