Comment: 
This line of code assigns the value of 'lut_index' to the 'status' net/variable. The Verilog keyword 'assign' is used for continuously driving 'status' with the value of 'lut_index', making 'status' reflect any changes in 'lut_index'. This could be useful in displaying the current index of a lookup table or signaling the status based on 'lut_index'. This behavior is implemented using the continuous assignment feature of Verilog's hardware description language.
