    "module": "Module-level comment: i2c_av_config is an I2C configuration module that generates and transmits data sequences over an I2C bus. The module uses a lookup table for data generation, a state machine for control flow, and an external I2C controller for data transmission. It works in sync with a clock and can be reset to its initial state. It contains two input ports ('clk' and 'reset'), two output ports ('i2c_sclk', 'i2c_sdat'), one inout port ('i2c_sdat'), and seven internal signals for operation. The module's operation can be externally monitored via a 'status' port."
