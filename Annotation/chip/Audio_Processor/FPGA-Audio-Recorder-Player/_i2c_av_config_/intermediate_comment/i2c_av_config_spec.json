    "spec": "Module name: i2c_av_config.\nModule specification: \n\nThe \"i2c_av_config\" module implements an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) configuration to generate and transmit configuration data sequences using a look-up table over an I2C bus, with reset functionality. It includes two input ports: 'clk' as the clock signal directing the timing of all operations, and 'reset' to restore the module to its initial state. The output ports include 'i2c_sclk' for I2C bus timing, 'i2c_sdat' for data transmission, and a 4-bit 'status' port indicating the current index of the look-up table. The bi-directional 'i2c_sdat' facilitates exchange of data between devices. Internally, the module encompasses seven signals for carrying out its operations: 'i2c_data' holds the information to be sent; 'lut_data' keeps the current data from the look-up table; 'lut_index' points to the current entry of the look-up table; 'i2c_start' initiates the I2C cycle; 'i2c_done' and 'i2c_ack' denote completion and successful transmission respectively; and 'control_state' reflects the state of the finite state machine controlling the module. The module is divided into different sections: the I2C controller instantiation, generation of look-up table data, state machine for lookup table index and I2C operation, all synchronized by the positive clock edge. The module provides an accurate, organized, and effective interface for I2C configuration and control.",

It generates configuration data sequences using a look-up table and then sends them over an I2C bus. The module uses an external I2C controller. In every clock cycle, controlled by the state machine, it formats the look-up table data with an 8-bit prefix and feeds this to the I2C controller. It continues with the next item in the table if an acknowledgement (ACK) is received back from the I2C controller, indicating successful transmission. It continues this until all the entries in the look-up table have been processed. The index in the look-up table is output via the 'status' port to enable external monitoring of the module's operation. The module includes reset functionality that sets the look-up table index back to 0, stops the I2C controller, and resets the state machine."
