    "block_comment": "This block of code declares a two-bit register named 'control_state' and initializes it with the binary value '00'. The 'reg' keyword in Verilog signifies a register-type variable which is capable of retaining its value until another one is assigned. In this case, 'control_state' can encapsulate one of four states (00, 01, 10, 11) as it's a 2-bit (from 1 to 0) register. The 'control_state' is likely used to maintain some form of state-based control or contribute to a Finite State Machine (FSM) operation in the wider system."
