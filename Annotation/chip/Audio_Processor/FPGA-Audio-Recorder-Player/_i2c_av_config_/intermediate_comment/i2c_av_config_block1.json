    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a finite state machine controller for an I2C transmission sequence. On each clock cycle, the control state dictates further actions. If a reset signal is received, it initializes all variables. When in idle state ('00'), it starts an I2C transmission and moves to next state. In state '01', it stops the I2C transmission and moves to state '10'. In '10' state, if an I2C transmission has completed and the acknowledgment was received, it checks if it reached the last index of the Lookup table (LUT), and depending on that, it either moves to the '11' state or reverts to state '00' by incrementing the LUT index. If the acknowledgement was not received, it reverts back to its idle state '00' ready for a new transmission."
