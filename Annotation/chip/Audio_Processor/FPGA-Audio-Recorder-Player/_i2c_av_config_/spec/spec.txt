Module name: i2c_av_config.
Module specification: 

The "i2c_av_config" module implements an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) configuration to generate and transmit configuration data sequences using a look-up table over an I2C bus, with reset functionality. It includes two input ports: 'clk' as the clock signal directing the timing of all operations, and 'reset' to restore the module to its initial state. The output ports include 'i2c_sclk' for I2C bus timing, 'i2c_sdat' for data transmission, and a 4-bit 'status' port indicating the current index of the look-up table. The bi-directional 'i2c_sdat' facilitates exchange of data between devices. Internally, the module encompasses seven signals for carrying out its operations: 'i2c_data' holds the information to be sent; 'lut_data' keeps the current data from the look-up table; 'lut_index' points to the current entry of the look-up table; 'i2c_start' initiates the I2C cycle; 'i2c_done' and 'i2c_ack' denote completion and successful transmission respectively; and 'control_state' reflects the state of the finite state machine controlling the module. The module is divided into different sections: the I2C controller instantiation, generation of look-up table data, state machine for lookup table index and I2C operation, all synchronized by the positive clock edge. The module provides an accurate, organized, and effective interface for I2C configuration and control.
