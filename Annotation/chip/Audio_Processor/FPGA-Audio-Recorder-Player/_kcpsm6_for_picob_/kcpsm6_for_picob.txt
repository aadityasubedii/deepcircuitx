Module-level comment: This module implements a PicoBlaze-6 soft microcontroller core. It features an ALU, register banks, program counter, stack, and scratch pad memory. The module decodes and executes instructions, handles interrupts, and manages I/O operations. It uses a multi-stage pipeline with control logic for instruction fetching, decoding, and execution. The design includes separate blocks for arithmetic/logical operations, shift/rotate functions, and memory access, all coordinated by internal control signals and state management.
