This block serves as a conditional small scratchpad memory (small_spm_ram) based on indexing `i` as 0 or 4. The implementation contains a 64-bit RAM with 4 input/output ports (DOA, DOB, DOC, DOD) which link to sequential indices of the scratchpad memory data `spm_ram_data[]`. Memory locations for writing/reading are provided by `sy_or_kk[5:0]`. The data to be stored comes from `sx[]` at corresponding indices. The write to the memory is controlled by the write enable signal `spm_enable` and the write operation is synched to the system clock `clk`.
