Comment: 
This block of verilog code describes a flip-flop named `shadow_bank_flop`, a key component in a memory management subsystem. The flip-flop effectively serves as a temporary data storage mechanism, buffering data from `stack_bank` into `shadow_bank` synchronously with the provided clock signal (`clk`). Its operation is crucial for sequential data processing stages within the design.
