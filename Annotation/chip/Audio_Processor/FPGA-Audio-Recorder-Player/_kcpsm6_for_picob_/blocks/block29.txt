This block is a macro instantiation of a 32-bit wide memory module (RAM32M) named "kcpsm6_stack_ram1". This module is being equipped with default initialization for memory spaces A, B, C, and D with 64 bits of zeros. The stack_memory is divided into 4-segment data bit pairs, which are mapped to the DOA, DOB, DOC, and DOD ports, respectively. The same bit distribution method is applied to the program counter (pc) data, assigned to the DIA, DIB, DIC, and DID inputs. The Address for these four segments is taken from the same stack pointer bits from 4 to 0. Write operation is determined by the second bit of the t_state variable with the help of clock signal WCLK.
