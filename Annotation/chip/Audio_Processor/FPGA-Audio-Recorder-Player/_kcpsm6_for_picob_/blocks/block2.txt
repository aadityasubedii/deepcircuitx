This statement is responsible for generating a delayed version of the 'clk' signal. In Verilog, it does so using the 'assign' keyword and the delay control operator. The '#200' following 'assign' expresses that the desired delay is 200 units of simulation time. Consequently, 'clk_del' updates its value to that of 'clk' every 200 time units.
