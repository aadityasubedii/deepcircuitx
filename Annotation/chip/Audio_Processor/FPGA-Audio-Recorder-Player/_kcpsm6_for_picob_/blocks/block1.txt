Comment: 
The block implements an instruction decoder and simulation logic for a KCPSM6 processor. It decodes instructions, updates processor status flags, and simulates register and memory operations. The decoder interprets the instruction opcode and sets the corresponding instruction mnemonic in 'kcpsm6_opcode'. It also updates status flags for zero, carry, and interrupt enable conditions. The block simulates register banks, scratchpad memory operations, and maintains processor state for simulation purposes. Additionally, it handles special instructions like RETURN, ENABLE/DISABLE INTERRUPT, and REGBANK selection.
