The block of code decodes an 8-bit instruction into hexadecimal representation. This is achieved by splitting the instruction into two 4-bit sections and passing them individually through the `hexcharacter` function. The output from this operation is a 16-bit hexadecimal representation where the first 8 bits are obtained by decoding the upper four bits of instruction and the next 8 bits are derived from decoding the lower four bits of instruction.
