This block implements a stack with its corresponding push and pop control operations using a loop and LUT-based control logic. The first section within the loop (lsb_stack) sets up the base case, denoting the least significant bit of the stack. It involves a flop (FDR), a lookup table (LUT6_2), an XOR gate (XORCY), and a multiplexer (MUXCY) for stack control mechanism. The stack data is carried through multiple blocks with the help of stack_pointer. The second part of the loop handles the rest of the stack (other bits), with each element using the carry from the previous element. Each element uses a similar combination of a flop (FDR), a lookup table (LUT6_2), an XOR gate (XORCY), and a multiplexer (MUXCY), with the carry input to the XOR and MUX blocks taken from the output carry of the previous element's Mux block. This effect creates a ripple-like mechanism for handling carry propagation.
