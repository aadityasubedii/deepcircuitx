Comment: 
The function of this block is to initialize and instantiate a 128-word scratch pad memory (SPM) and a flip-flop. The SPM receives data from a multiplexing source, 'sx', when the 'spm_enable' signal is active. The address for the memory is each bit from 'sy_or_kk' array, and the output of the memory block is 'spm_ram_data'. In the implementation details, it uses a 'RAM128X1S' component for memory and a 'FD' component for a flop. The purpose of the flop is to hold the output of the memory block, and its clocked by the same clock as the memory block.
