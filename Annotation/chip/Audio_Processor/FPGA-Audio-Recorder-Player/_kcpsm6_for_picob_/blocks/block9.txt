Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is primarily responsible for defining registers to temporarily store data for two different memory banks, referred to as 'bank_a' and 'bank_b'. Each bank consists of sixteen 8-bit wide registers labelled from 's0' to 'sf' in hexadecimal. These registers can hold, transfer, and manipulate 8-bit data within each respective memory bank.
