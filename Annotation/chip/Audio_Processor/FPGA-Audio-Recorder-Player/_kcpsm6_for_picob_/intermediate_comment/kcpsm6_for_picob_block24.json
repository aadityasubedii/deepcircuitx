    "block_comment": "The block performs bit-wise arithmetic operation for both logical and arithmetic calculations, specifically for the least significant bit (i=0). The block uses two key components: an XOR gate (XORCY) and a multiplexer (MUXCY) to perform the operations. The multiplexer considers the logical carry mask and arithmetic carry-in to set an initial carry value. The XOR gate subsequently uses this carry-in value along with the output from multiplexer to calculate the final arithmetic and logical value."
