    "block_comment": "The block of code is an instantiation of a flip-flop component which is used for storing the stack zero flag value and serving it when needed. The function of the FD (flip-flop) component is to capture the value of stack_zero_flag on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk), and then hold that value (which represents whether the stack is empty or not) until the next rising clock edge. If the stack_zero_flag changes between clock edges, the updated value will be captured and held by the component at the next rising edge, allowing for synchronized data transfer."
