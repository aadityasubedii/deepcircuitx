    "block_comment": "This block of code sets up memory addressing and access control for a block RAM (BRAM) in a Verilog design. The 'address' is directly assigned from the program counter 'pc'. It implies that the BRAM address to be accessed is dependent on the program counter, which may relate to a fetch-execute cycle in a processor design. In addition, the 'bram_enable' is assigned the third bit of the 't_state' register. This indicates that the enabling of BRAM operation (read or write) is controlled by some state machine, specifically, the third state (considering bit indexing starts from 0). The state machine driving 't_state' likely commands the operational timing of the BRAM."
