    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a flip flop named `shadow_zero_flag_flop` which serves as a logic gate in the \"kcpsm6_decode1\" module in a Verilog design. Its purpose is to hold the state of the `shadow_zero_value` and propagate it to the output `shadow_zero_flag` signal on every rising edge of the system clock signal `clk`. The flip flop implementation is indicated via the `FD` declaration, indicating a D flip-flop, with input `D` (data), output `Q`, and clock `C`."
