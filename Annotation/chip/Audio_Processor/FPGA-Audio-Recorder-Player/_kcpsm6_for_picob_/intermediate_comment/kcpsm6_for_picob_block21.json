    "block_comment": "The block of code describes a functional module that performs a bit-shift or bit-rotation operation. This operation is conditionally performed only when the hardware build flag for a certain bit position 'i' is set (hwbuild[i] == 1'b1). The shift or rotate operation itself is implemented by an instance of a D flip-flop module called `shift_rotate_flop`. The D input of the flip-flop is given by `shift_rotate_value[i]`, and the output is returned in `shift_rotate_result[i]`. The synchronous set control input (S) for the flip-flop is sourced from the 8th bit of the instruction code, and the flip-flop is gated by a clock signal `clk`."
