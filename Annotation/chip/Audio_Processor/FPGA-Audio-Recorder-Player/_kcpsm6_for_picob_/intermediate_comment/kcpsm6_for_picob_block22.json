    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code represents a synchronous flip-flop that is used in a shift or rotate function. If the corresponding bit in the 'hwbuild' array is zero, the flip-flop 'shift_rotate_flop' is instantiated. The D input of the flip-flop is connected to the 'shift_rotate_value[i]' signal, while the Q output is tied to 'shift_rotate_result[i]'. The flip-flop is reset when the 8th bit of the 'instruction' signal is '1'. The clock signal 'clk' drives the flip-flop. Thus, this block conditionally stores and passes on a particular bit based on the clock and the reset instruction, contributing to the shift or rotate functionality."
