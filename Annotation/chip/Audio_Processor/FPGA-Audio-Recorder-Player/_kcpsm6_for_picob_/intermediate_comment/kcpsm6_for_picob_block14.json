    "block_comment": "This block of code is for implementing a specific aspect of a scratch-pad memory (SPM) with a size of 256. It establishes a RAM unit and a flip-flop. The RAM unit, \"spm_ram\", uses a single-port RAM of size 256 with an all-zero initial value. The RAM's data input, 'D', is tagged to 'sx' array's ith element and its address input, 'A', is mapped to 'sy_or_kk'. The RAM is write-enabled when 'spm_enable' is true and this process is synchronized with a clock signal, 'clk'. The output of the RAM, 'O', is presented as 'spm_ram_data' array's ith element. Then, for maintaining and providing previous state's data, a flip-flop, 'spm_flop', is initiated which stores the ith element of 'spm_ram_data' from RAM as current data and gives the output as ith element of 'spm_data' array, clocked at 'clk'."
