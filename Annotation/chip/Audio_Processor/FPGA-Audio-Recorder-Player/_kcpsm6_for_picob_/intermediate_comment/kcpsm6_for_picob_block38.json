    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs the operation of assigning values to system registers 'sx_addr' and 'sy_addr'. It does this by selecting specific bit ranges from the 'instruction' register. Specifically, the 'sx_addr' is assigned with the 8th to the 11th bit of the 'instruction' register. Similarly, 'sy_addr' is formed by concatenating 'bank' with the 4th to the 7th bit of the 'instruction' register."
