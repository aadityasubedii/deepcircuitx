    "block_comment": "This block of code performs variable shifting and rotation operations, as part of a larger microprocessor module. Based on conditional control-i.e., when index (i) equals 2 or 4-the module carries out a specific look-up table (LUT) operation defined by a 6-input, 2-output LUT with predetermined hex initialization values. Input to this LUT is from selective indices of 'sx' array and 'instruction[3]' bit, while output is directed to respective indices of 'shift_rotate_value'. The shift or rotate operation depends upon data at the selective indices of 'sx' array and 'instruction[3]'."
