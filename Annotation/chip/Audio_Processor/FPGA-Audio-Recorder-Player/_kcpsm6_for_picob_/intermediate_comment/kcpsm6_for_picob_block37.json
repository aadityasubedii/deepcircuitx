    "block_comment": "The block assigns the value of two variables, sx[3:0] and sy, to a vector called register_vector. The implementation first selects the 4-bit slice [3:0] from the sx variable, then concatenates it with the value of sy, forming a new vector content which is then assigned to register_vector in a concurrent assignment operation."
