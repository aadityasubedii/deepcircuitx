    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a memory stack for a PicoBlaze microcontroller program. It uses a Xilinx RAM32M block with a bit width of 32 and an address space of 16, initialized to zero states. The memory stack is controlled through the \"stack_pointer\" address lines, which reference specific memory locations. The Write Enable ('WE') signal is controlled by the 't_state' signal, activating on the clock's rising edge. Data is written to or read from the stack, dependent on flags, bit, bank, and the program counter ('pc') signals."
