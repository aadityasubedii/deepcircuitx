    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is an assignment operation that sets the value of `port_id` equal to `sy_or_kk`. The function of this block is to ensure that both identifiers `port_id` and `sy_or_kk` share the same value at all times. Whenever the value of `sy_or_kk` changes, the `port_id` will automatically update to reflect this change. It's a simple, direct operation achieved through the keyword `assign` which effectively creates a continuous assignment statement in the hardware design."
