    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block implements the functionality of a shift/rotate operation in a loop body when the index `i` is 0. It uses two lookup tables (LUTs): `shift_bit_lut` and `shift_rotate_lut`. The `shift_bit_lut` uses six input signals, including the first three bits of `instruction`, `carry_flag`, and two bits from `sx` to generate the `shift_in_bit` using a hardcoded truth table defined by `.INIT`. The `shift_rotate_lut` leverages the `shift_in_bit`, a sequence of `sx` bits, the fourth bit of `instruction`, and a boolean 1 to develop `shift_rotate_value[i]` and `shift_rotate_value[i+1]` using another hardcoded truth table."
