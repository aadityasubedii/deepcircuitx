    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs high-level arithmetic and logic operation, specifically addition in this context. It utilizes a carry-save MUXCY (multiplexer carry gate) and a XORCY (exclusive OR carry gate) to achieve this process. The MUXCY, whose inputs are the logical_carry_mask at bit position 'i', carry_arith_logical at position 'i-1', and 'half_arith_logical'[i], generates an output 'carry_arith_logical'[i]. This output is the carry result for the arithmetic logic operation at the 'i'th bit. The XORCY uses the 'half_arith_logical'[i] and 'carry_arith_logical'[i-1] as inputs to generate the 'arith_logical_value[i]', which is the sum for the 'i'th bit. This sequence ensures arithmetic and logic operations are correctly performed in sequential order."
