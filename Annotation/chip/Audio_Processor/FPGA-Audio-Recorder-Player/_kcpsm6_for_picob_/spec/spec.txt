Module name: kcpsm6. Module specification: The kcpsm6 module implements a PicoBlaze-6 soft microcontroller core, featuring an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), register banks, program counter, stack, and scratch pad memory. It decodes and executes instructions, handles interrupts, and provides input/output interfaces. The module has input ports for instruction (18-bit), in_port (8-bit), interrupt, sleep, reset, and clock signals, while its output ports include address (12-bit), bram_enable, out_port (8-bit), port_id (8-bit), write_strobe, k_write_strobe, read_strobe, and interrupt_ack. Internally, it uses numerous signals for control (e.g., t_state, run, internal_reset), ALU operations (e.g., arith_logical_sel
