This protocol allows communication between different ICs using a two-wire interface (Serial Clock Line - SCLK and Serial Data Line - SDAT). In this module, based on the 'start' signal, I2C data is initialized, and the communication process is triggered. During this process, data bits from 'i2c_data' input are sent in stages and the reception of acknowledgment bits are also managed. The 'done' output signal indicates when all stages of the data transfer are completed. 'sclk_divider' is used to generate the timing for the I2C protocol, and 'clock_en' enables the I2C clock. Similarly, 'stage' indicates the current stage of the I2C data transmission, while 'acks' stores incoming acknowledgment signals. The module displays functionalities like clock generation, acknowledgment reception, and data transmission according to the I2C protocol standard."

In each stage, the respective bit from 'data' is accessed and assigned to 'sdat' for transmission.\n\n2. stage: This is a 5-bit signal used to keep track of the current stage of the I2C transmission process.
