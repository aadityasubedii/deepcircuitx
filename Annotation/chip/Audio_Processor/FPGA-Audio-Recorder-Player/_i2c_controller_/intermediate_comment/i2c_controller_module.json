    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'i2c_controller' module implements an I2C protocol controller for chip-to-chip communication over a two-wire interface. It initializes I2C data transmission upon a 'start' signal, controlled by an internal 'clk' clock signal. Data bits for transmission are sequentially prepared and acknowledgment bits are processed. The module has input ports for clock, start signal, and data, and output ports for I2C clock, data line (bidirectional), done and acknowledgment signals. The process is coordinated via internal signals that handle data storage, emission/reception stages, clock division, clock enabling, mid-low point detection, and acknowledgment storage. The actual data and ack movements are managed through condition checks within different stages. The 'done' signal signifies completion of all operations."
