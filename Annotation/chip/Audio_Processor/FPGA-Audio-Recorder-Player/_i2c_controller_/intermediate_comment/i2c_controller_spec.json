    "spec": "Module name: i2c_controller.   \n\nModule specification: The 'i2c_controller' module is designed to function as an I2C protocol controller that facilitates communication between ICs through a two-wire interface. It contains input ports such as 'clk', 'i2c_data', and 'start'. 'clk' is the timing signal that drives the sequence of operations within the module. 'i2c_data', a 24-bit signal, carries the data to be transmitted through the I2C protocol, and 'start' commands the initiation of the transmission process. The output ports include 'i2c_sclk', 'i2c_sdat', 'done', and 'ack'. Here, 'i2c_sclk' is the clock signal for I2C communication, 'i2c_sdat' is the data line that works in both transmission and reception modes, 'done' indicates the completion of the data transmission process, and 'ack' provides acknowledgment signals for received data.  \n\nThe internal operations primarily involve signals like 'data', 'stage', 'sclk_divider', 'clock_en', 'midlow', 'sdat', 'acks'. The module uses 'data' to load and access transmission data bit by bit, 'stage' to track I2C transmission stages, 'sclk_divider' to generate the I2C protocol timing, 'clock_en' to control the I2C clock, 'midlow' to manage data and acknowledgment bit writing, 'sdat' for data transmission, and 'acks' to handle incoming acknowledgment signals.  \n\nThe code involves various blocks managing different operations. At start signal, internal registers are reset and initialized, and then the I2C protocol stages are handled based on the clock signal. Various cases in stages manage the setup and hold periods, data writing, and acknowledgment handling. Finally, the 'done' signal indicates the completion of all stages, making the i2c_controller module a reliable element in data communication using the I2C protocol.",

This protocol allows communication between different ICs using a two-wire interface (Serial Clock Line - SCLK and Serial Data Line - SDAT). In this module, based on the 'start' signal, I2C data is initialized, and the communication process is triggered.

The 'done' output signal indicates when all stages of the data transfer are completed. 'sclk_divider' is used to generate the timing for the I2C protocol, and 'clock_en' enables the I2C clock. Similarly, 'stage' indicates the current stage of the I2C data transmission, while 'acks' stores incoming acknowledgment signals.

                    "text": "Module name: i2c_controller.   \n\nModule specification: The 'i2c_controller' module is designed to function as an I2C protocol controller that facilitates communication between ICs through a two-wire interface. It contains input ports such as 'clk', 'i2c_data', and 'start'. 'clk' is the timing signal that drives the sequence of operations within the module. 'i2c_data', a 24-bit signal, carries the data to be transmitted through the I2C protocol, and 'start' commands the initiation of the transmission process. The output ports include 'i2c_sclk', 'i2c_sdat', 'done', and 'ack'. Here, 'i2c_sclk' is the clock signal for I2C communication, 'i2c_sdat' is the data line that works in both transmission and reception modes, 'done' indicates the completion of the data transmission process, and 'ack' provides acknowledgment signals for received data.  \n\nThe internal operations primarily involve signals like 'data', 'stage', 'sclk_divider', 'clock_en', 'midlow', 'sdat', 'acks'. The module uses 'data' to load and access transmission data bit by bit, 'stage' to track I2C transmission stages, 'sclk_divider' to generate the I2C protocol timing, 'clock_en' to control the I2C clock, 'midlow' to manage data and acknowledgment bit writing, 'sdat' for data transmission, and 'acks' to handle incoming acknowledgment signals.  \n\nThe code involves various blocks managing different operations. At start signal, internal registers are reset and initialized, and then the I2C protocol stages are handled based on the clock signal. Various cases in stages manage the setup and hold periods, data writing, and acknowledgment handling. Finally, the 'done' signal indicates the completion of all stages, making the i2c_controller module a reliable element in data communication using the I2C protocol."
