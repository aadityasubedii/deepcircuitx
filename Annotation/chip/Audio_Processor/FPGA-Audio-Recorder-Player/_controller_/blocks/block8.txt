Comment: 
The block of code provides assignments for control signals for the pushbutton (pb), uart, and state register activities, as well as for status LEDs. It inverts the reset input signal to generate the pb_reset and uart_reset signals. A default pb_interrupt is maintained at logic 0. The write to uart and state register depends on pushbutton write strobe coincidence with select port id's 8'h03 and 8'h06 respectively. The status LEDs are driven by values of variables record and play.
