The block serves as the top hierarchical module for a SoCkit audio processing system. It interfaces with an audio device providing functionalities such as playback and volume control. The module operates off a 100MHz clock and integrates plains such as I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), PLL, and audio data/clock lines, as marked by associated signals like `AUD_ADCLRCK`, `AUD_ADCDAT`, `AUD_DACLRCK`, etc. It also interfaces with physical hardware button (KEY) and switches (SW). It receives audio data from memory and sends processed audio output. Accompanying clocks (`audio_clk`) are also part of inputs/outputs.
