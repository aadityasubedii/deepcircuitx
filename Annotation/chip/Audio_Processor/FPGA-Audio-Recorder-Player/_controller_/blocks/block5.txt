This block of code is the instantiation of a PicoBlaze soft processor from Xilinx. It includes a configuration for different aspects of the processor operation. 'pb_port_id', 'pb_in_port', and 'pb_out_port' are used for communication with the outside world through predefined I/O ports. 'pb_read_strobe' and 'pb_write_strobe' signals are used to read from and write to these ports. The processor is controlled through a 'pb_reset' signal and can generate an interrupt given by 'pb_interrupt'. The signal 'interrupt_ack' is used as acknowledge for the interrupt. The clock signal 'clk100mhz' provides the timing source for the processor.
