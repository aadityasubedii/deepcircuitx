    "block_comment": "The block in the Verilog code is a instantiation of the `ram_interface_wrapper` module. This module works as a Random Access Memory (RAM) controller. The module controls the flow of data into and out of the RAM by organizing read and write requests. It takes in inputs such as `address`, `RAMin` (input data), `enableWrite` (write enable signal), and `reqRead` (read request signal) and outputs the data from RAM (`RAMout`). It also generates necessary control signals such as `hw_ram_rasn`, `hw_ram_casn`, `hw_ram_wen`, etc. to interact with the physical RAM module. This controller is used to generate the clock signal (`clk`) and handles reset functionality. Furthermore, it handles status indictors (`STATLED3`, `STATLED4`). It interacts with the RAM using these inputs and outputs, facilitating read and write operations smoothly."
