    "block_comment": "This Verilog block handles the reset and operation logic of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) with peripheral interfaces. Upon reset, it zeroes the values of `pb_in_port` and `read_from_uart`. For each 100MHz-clock cycle, it updates `pb_in_port` and `read_from_uart` based on `pb_port_id` and `pb_read_strobe`. It also allows writing to various state registers (`record`, `play`, `delete`, `pause`, `delete_all`) based on the value of `pb_out_port` when `write_to_state_reg` is asserted."
