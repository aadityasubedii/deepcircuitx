The FPGA-Audio-Recorder-Player repository is designed to facilitate comprehensive functionalities around audio recording, playback, and processing on an FPGA platform. It hosts a variety of modules including controllers for audio interfacing, data transport over I2C, UART communication handling, button signal debouncing, and interfaces for RAM and audio codecs. The system integrates core functionalities via the ‘controller’ module that manages high-level operations like recording and playback, utilizing sub-modules for clock generation and memory management. I2C modules developed in the repository handle data communication between chips with the 'i2c_controller' ensuring sequential data transmission and 'i2c_av_config' for automated data transmission using a lookup table. The UART modules, both receiver 'uart_rx6' and transmitter 'uart_tx6,' process serial communication efficiently, governed by clock signals and internal buffers. Audio processing is divided amongst dedicated modules such as the 'audio_codec' which handles codec interfacing, and 'audio_effects' for real-time audio effect application. Moreover, the repository supports programming and instruction handling for PicoBlaze microcontrollers, demonstrated in the 'kcpsm6_for_picob' and 'picob' modules, efficient for managing I/O and executing stored programs. Lastly, the system's integration and high-level control are encompassed in the 'sockit_top' module, which cleverly ties together various functionalities like playback control, volume adjustment, and audio source selection through sub-module collaboration. This orchestrated module interaction facilitates a robust FPGA-based audio processing system ideal for real-time audio manipulation and control tasks.
