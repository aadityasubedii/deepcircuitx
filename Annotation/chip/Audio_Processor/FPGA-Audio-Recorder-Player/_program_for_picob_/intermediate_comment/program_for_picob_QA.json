It takes a 12-bit address input and provides an 18-bit instruction output. The module uses four RAMB16BWER (Block RAM) components to store the program instructions. It also includes logic to select the appropriate data from these RAM blocks based on the input address. The module is designed to work with a clock and an enable signal, suggesting it's part of a synchronous system."
