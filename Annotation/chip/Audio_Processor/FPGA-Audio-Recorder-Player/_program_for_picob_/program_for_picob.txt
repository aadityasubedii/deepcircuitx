Module-level comment: 
/**
 * This module implements a ROM for a KCPSM6 processor, storing program instructions.
 * It uses four RAMB16BWER blocks to provide 18-bit instructions based on 12-bit addresses.
 * The module includes address decoding, data routing, and synchronization logic to interface
 * with the RAM blocks and output the appropriate instruction on each clock cycle when enabled.
