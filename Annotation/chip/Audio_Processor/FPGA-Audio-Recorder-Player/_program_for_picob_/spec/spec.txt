Module name: program. Module specification: The "program" module implements a Read-Only Memory (ROM) for a KCPSM6 (PicoBlaze) processor. It takes a 12-bit address input and provides an 18-bit instruction output, using four RAMB16BWER (Block RAM) components to store program instructions. The module has input ports for address[11:0], enable, and clk, and an output port for instruction[17:0]. Internal signals include address_a, pipe_a11, data_in_a, data_out_a_*, address_b, data_in_b_*, data_out_b_*, enable_b, clk_b, and we_b, which are used to interface with the RAM blocks and manage data flow. The module consists of several sections: signal declarations, address and data routing logic, a flip-flop
