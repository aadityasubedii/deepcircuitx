    "block_comment": "This block of logic controls an audio data handling unit in response to various flags/commands (reset, set_lrck, clr_lrck, set_bclk, clr_bclk) and channel selection (channel_sel). When reset is true, all shift registers are cleared. If either set_lrck or clr_lrck are active, based on channel selection, audio output data is shifted. When set_bclk is high, the audio data input (AUD_ADCDAT) is stored in a shift register (shift_in) with respect to channel selection. When clr_bclk is high, the shift_out register is cleared by handling the least significant bit."
