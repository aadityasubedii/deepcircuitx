    "block_comment": "The block governs clock frequency division with reset functionality. Triggered by a positive edge clock signal, the divider counters for LRCK and BCLK are reset upon an active 'reset' signal. If the 'reset' is inactive, the dividers increment, adjusting the frequency of the respective signals."
