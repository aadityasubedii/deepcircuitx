    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog defines a wire called 'clr_lrck'. The function of the code block is to generate a clear signal for the 'lrck_divider'. When the 'lrck_divider' equals 8'h7F (in hexadecimal, equivalent to 127 in decimal), the 'clr_lrck' sends a high (1) signal synchronously, otherwise it sends a low (0) signal. This high/low signal can be used to reset or clear other modules or components in the bigger design."
