    "block_comment": "This block of code specifies a signal `sample_end[0]` that indicates when the Left-right clock divider (`lrck_divider`) counter matches the constant `8'hc0`. It uses an 'assign' statement, an intrinsic continuous assignment feature of Verilog, to continuously check if `lrck_divider` equals `8'hc0` (hexadecimal representation for 192). If the condition is true, `sample_end[0]` is activated, hence serving as an end of sample marker."
