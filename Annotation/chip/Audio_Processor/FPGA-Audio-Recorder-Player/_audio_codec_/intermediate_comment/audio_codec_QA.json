It manages the timing (through `lrck_divider` and `bclk_divider`) and receipt or dispatch of audio data (through `shift_in`, `shift_out`, and `shift_temp`) from and to the actual hardware via a bi-directional clock link (`AUD_BCLK`), a left-right clock link (`AUD_DACLRCK` for output and `AUD_ADCLRCK` for input), and data link (`AUD_DACDAT` for output data, and `AUD_ADCDAT` for input data). The module also controls the specific audio channel (via `channel_sel`) and applies volume control (via `volume_control`). The signals `sample_end` and `sample_req` signify the end of a current audio sample and the request for a new sample, which would be useful in a continuous audio data stream scenario."
