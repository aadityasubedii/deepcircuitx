This block of code assigns a boolean value to the first element of the `sample_req` array. The value is determined based on whether the `lrck_divider` variable equals hexadecimal value '7e'. If `lrck_divider` equals '7e', it will assign one, otherwise, it will assign zero due to the nature of the equality check operation in Verilog.
