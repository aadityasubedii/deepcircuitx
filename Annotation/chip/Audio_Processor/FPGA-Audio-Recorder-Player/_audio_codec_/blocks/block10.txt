Comment: 
This block is performing a task of generating an end signal for a sampling process. It does this by comparing `lrck_divider` with a fixed point `8'h40`. If the value of `lrck_divider` equals `8'h40`, the `sample_end[1]` is assigned as true, signaling the end of the sample process. Leveraging bitwise comparison, this block efficiently determines when a defined criterion is met to terminate a process.
