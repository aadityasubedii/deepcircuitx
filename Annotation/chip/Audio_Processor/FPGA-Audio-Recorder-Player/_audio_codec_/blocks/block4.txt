Comment: 
This code block creates a wire `set_lrck` which reflects the state of a Left-Right Clock (LRCK) divider. The wire state is determined by comparing `lrck_divider` with hexadecimal 'FF'. The purpose of this comparison is to monitor when the `lrck_divider` reaches its maximum 8-bit value, hence causing an overflow. If the `lrck_divider` equals 'FF', the wire `set_lrck` is set high; if not, it is set low.
