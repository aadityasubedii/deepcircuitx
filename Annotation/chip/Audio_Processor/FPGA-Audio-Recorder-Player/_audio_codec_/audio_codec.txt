Module-level comment: The `audio_codec` module is a controller for an audio codec chip, managing data transfer, sampling process, channel selection, and volume control. Inputs include clock signals, volume control, audio output and ADC data, while outputs comprise of various audio data, sample request and end signals, and DAC and BCLK signals. With clock dividers, `lrck_divider` and `bclk_divider`, managing timing, and shift registers, `shift_in`, `shift_out` and `shift_temp`, handling data, the module orchestrates data exchange and controls audio functions. This is achieved by specific conditions set on the states of the dividers guiding the data exchanges, sample states, and clock functionalities.
