    "spec": "Module name: rs232_uart. \n\nModule specification: The rs232_uart module is a design for implementing a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) for the RS232 communication protocol, consisting of two key components - a 'transmitter' and a 'receiver'. The purpose of the transmitter is to convert parallel input data into a serial format for outbound communication, and the receiver does the reverse, converting serial input data back into its parallel form. The speed of serial communication, known as the baud rate, is controlled by an internal 10-bit register 'baud_count', which resets at 'MAX_BAUD_COUNT' and generates a slower clock signal used for the baud rate in the transmitter and receiver modules. \n\nThe module has several input and output ports. Input Ports include: 'tx_data_in' which is a 8-bit parallel data for transmission, 'write_tx_data' a signal for writing data into the transmitter buffer, 'rs232_rx' which is the serial data input line, 'read_rx_data_ack' signal confirming receiver data has been read, and 'reset', 'clk' signals for controlling timing and sequencing. Output Ports include: 'rx_data_out' which is a received serial data converted back to 8-bit parallel data, 'tx_buffer_full' signal indicating the transmitter buffer is full, 'rx_data_present' signal indication presence of data in the receiver buffer, and 'rs232_tx' which is the serial data output line. \n\nThe module can be divided into three main code blocks. The first block declares and initializes all necessary I/O ports, parameters and internal signals. The following block, consisting of an always-loop updating 'baud_count' and 'en_16_x_baud' (a signal that is enabled once the baud rate has cycled) based on 'reset' and 'clk' signals. The last two blocks consist of the 'transmitter' and 'receiver' sub-modules, which carry out the UART functionality under the control of 'en_16_x_baud' signal. Overall, this module efficiently handles RS232 serial communication with thoughtful features to prevent data overflow and control communication speed.",
