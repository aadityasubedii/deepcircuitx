It consists of two main parts: 'transmitter' and 'receiver'. The transmitter gets parallel input data, and converts it to serial data for outbound communication. The receiver gets serial input data, and converts it to parallel form. The baud rate for serial communication is controlled through a counter ('baud_count') that is reset at 'MAX_BAUD_COUNT'. Module also handles reading from and writing to internal buffers using read/write signals in a way that overflows of buffers are prevented."
