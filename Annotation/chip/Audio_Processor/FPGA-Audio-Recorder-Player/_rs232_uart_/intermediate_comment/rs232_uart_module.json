    "module": "Module-level comment: This 'rs232_uart' module implements a RS232 protocol UART via a 'transmitter' and 'receiver'. The transmitter takes 8-bit parallel input ('tx_data_in') and sends it serially ('rs232_tx'), while the receiver translates incoming serial data ('rs232_rx') back to parallel ('rx_data_out'). Serial communication speed is controlled by 'baud_count', a 10-bit register that drives 'en_16_x_baud', a slower clock signal utilized by both sub-modules. Additional control signals manage data overflow and read/write operations."
