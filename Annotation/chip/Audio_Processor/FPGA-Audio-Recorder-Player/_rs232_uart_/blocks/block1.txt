Comment: 
This block of code manages a counter that captures the baud rate for a communication interface. Using a clock edge-sensitive approach, when a reset is initiated, the baud count is zeroed, and the baud rate enable signal is turned off. If not in reset, the counter increments until reaching the maximum baud rate count where it is then reset, with the baud rate enable signal toggled on. Otherwise, the counter simply increments while the baud rate enable signal remains off.
