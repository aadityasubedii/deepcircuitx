It includes a set of parameters defining key characteristics of the interface such as data byte width. It receives inputs like address, data input, read or write enable signals, acknowledgment signals, and also clocks. The module handles reading and writing operations to the RAM according to input address and data. Depending on the data byte width specified, it is capable of processing a different byte at a time with defined masks. It consists of a sub-module \"ram_interface\" that connects the rendering application level I/Os to the actual memory-related hardware I/Os. The module signals when data is ready for reading and also maintains status LEDs for visual indications."
