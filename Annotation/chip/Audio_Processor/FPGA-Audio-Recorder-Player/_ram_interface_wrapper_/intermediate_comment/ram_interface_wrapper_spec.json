    "spec": "Module name: ram_interface_wrapper#. \n\nModule specification: The \"ram_interface_wrapper#\" serves primarily as an interface module for a RAM hardware component. The module contains a parameter 'DATA_BYTE_WIDTH' that defines the data width for read and write operations. Input ports of the module include 'address', 'data_in', 'write_enable', 'read_request', 'read_ack', 'reset', 'clk', 'sys_clk', and a set of 'hw_ram_*' concepts that control hardware-specific aspects of the connected RAM. Output ports include 'max_ram_address', 'rdy', 'clkout', 'data_out', status signals 'STATLED3', 'STATLED4', and a set of 'hw_ram_*' signals similar to the ones described in the input ports. There are various internal signals defined and used in the module, for instance, signals like 'wr_data_in' and 'ram_rd_bus' holding data to be written to and read from the RAM respectively. \n\nThe given Verilog code is organized into three sections: parameter declarations, input/output declarations and logic. The parameter declarations set the hardware parameters for the memory interface. After setting the parameters, module inputs and outputs are declared and internal signals are defined. The main logic section describes the actual interactions with the RAM hardware based on the inputs and the specified parameters, also decides the corresponding output and/or status signals. This includes calculation of write masks, computing maximum addresses for different data byte widths, and data in/out assignments based on addresses. Furthermore, the code handles special cases depending on the data byte width, as seen in the generate-if construct. The sub-module 'ram_interface' connects these application level concepts with actual memory-related hardware constructs. \n\nFinally, the module handles status LED indications, and indicates when it is ready for another operation or when there is data ready to be read. It appropriately computes the readiness and data presence signals based on the calibration completion and the completion or pending status of read/write operations respectively. Overall, the 'ram_interface_wrapper#' module is a critical RAM-interfacing hub that mediates between application level commands, data flow and the actual RAM hardware, hence enabling smooth and controlled memory operations.",

                    "text": "Module name: ram_interface_wrapper#. \n\nModule specification: The \"ram_interface_wrapper#\" serves primarily as an interface module for a RAM hardware component. The module contains a parameter 'DATA_BYTE_WIDTH' that defines the data width for read and write operations. Input ports of the module include 'address', 'data_in', 'write_enable', 'read_request', 'read_ack', 'reset', 'clk', 'sys_clk', and a set of 'hw_ram_*' concepts that control hardware-specific aspects of the connected RAM. Output ports include 'max_ram_address', 'rdy', 'clkout', 'data_out', status signals 'STATLED3', 'STATLED4', and a set of 'hw_ram_*' signals similar to the ones described in the input ports. There are various internal signals defined and used in the module, for instance, signals like 'wr_data_in' and 'ram_rd_bus' holding data to be written to and read from the RAM respectively. \n\nThe given Verilog code is organized into three sections: parameter declarations, input/output declarations and logic. The parameter declarations set the hardware parameters for the memory interface. After setting the parameters, module inputs and outputs are declared and internal signals are defined. The main logic section describes the actual interactions with the RAM hardware based on the inputs and the specified parameters, also decides the corresponding output and/or status signals. This includes calculation of write masks, computing maximum addresses for different data byte widths, and data in/out assignments based on addresses. Furthermore, the code handles special cases depending on the data byte width, as seen in the generate-if construct. The sub-module 'ram_interface' connects these application level concepts with actual memory-related hardware constructs. \n\nFinally, the module handles status LED indications, and indicates when it is ready for another operation or when there is data ready to be read. It appropriately computes the readiness and data presence signals based on the calibration completion and the completion or pending status of read/write operations respectively. Overall, the 'ram_interface_wrapper#' module is a critical RAM-interfacing hub that mediates between application level commands, data flow and the actual RAM hardware, hence enabling smooth and controlled memory operations."
