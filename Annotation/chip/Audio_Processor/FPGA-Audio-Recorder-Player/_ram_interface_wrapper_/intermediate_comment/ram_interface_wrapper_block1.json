    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is responsible for assignments of three signals 'rd_data_pres', 'rdy', and 'STATLED4'. The 'rd_data_pres' is simply assigned a true or false value depending on whether 'c3_p0_rd_count' is greater than zero. The ready ('rdy') signal is directly assigned the value of 'c3_calib_done', indicating that this block is ready when the calibration is completed. The LED status signal 'STATLED4' is assigned the value of 'c3_p0_rd_empty', which can be used to indicate whether the read buffer is empty or not."
