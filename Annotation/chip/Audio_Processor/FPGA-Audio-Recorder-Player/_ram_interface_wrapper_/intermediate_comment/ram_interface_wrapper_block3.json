    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is focused on setting up the write data, address translation and data output based on the data byte width. Depending on the size of the data byte width, the write data (`wr_data_in`) is repeated accordingly. Based on the least significant bits of the `address`, conditionally determined `write_mask` and `data_out` are assigned using a ternary operator. The statement `max_ram_address` assigns the maximum address range of the RAM, which decreases as 'DATA_BYTE_WIDTH' increases. The RAM command byte address `ram_cmd_byte_addr` is formed from the input `address` by considering necessary implementing byte alignment."
