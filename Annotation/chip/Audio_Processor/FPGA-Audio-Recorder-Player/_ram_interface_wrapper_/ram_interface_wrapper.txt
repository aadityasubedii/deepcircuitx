Module-level comment: This is the 'ram_interface_wrapper#' module, serving as an interface to a RAM device, handling read/write operations. It adjusts the byte width of data to be processed, maintains the status of the module, and interfaces with the RAM hardware. The module uses a parameter to adjust data byte width, uses input signals to perform actions like read/write, and controls the physical RAM operations through 'hw_ram_*' signals. Internal variables store inputs and monitor the status of ongoing operations. Depending on the data byte width, different portions of data are processed, byte addresses adjusted and actions signalled. The module also includes sub-modules, one of which is 'ram_interface' which connects the I/Os to the memory device. The module monitors and signals data readiness and operational status.
