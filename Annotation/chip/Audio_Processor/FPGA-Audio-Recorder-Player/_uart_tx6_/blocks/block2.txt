This block of code is responsible for assigning certain conditions to buffer operation flags. More specifically, it assigns the status of 'full_int' to 'buffer_full' indicating whether the buffer is full or not, the fourth bit of the 'pointer' to 'buffer_half_full' signalling if the buffer is half full, and the status of 'data_present_int' to 'buffer_data_present' to represent if there's data present in the buffer.
