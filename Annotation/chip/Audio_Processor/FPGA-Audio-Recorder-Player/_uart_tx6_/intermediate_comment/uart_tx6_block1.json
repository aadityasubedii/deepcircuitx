    "block_comment": "As the provided block of code is incomplete, it is technically an `endmodule` statement in Verilog, several details can be drawn. This specific keyword denotes the end of a module definition. Modules in Verilog are utilized to encapsulate specific blocks of code, typically representing a specific component of a digital design such as a Full-Adder, a Flip-Flop, or even more complex structures like an entire Central Processing Unit (CPU) design. The `endmodule` keyword essentially signifies that the definition of the module is complete, allowing the module to be instantiated elsewhere in the design as necessary. \n\nDue to the incomplete nature of the provided code, it's hard to provide more specific details on its function and how it achieves it. An ideal request would give the whole defined module for each unit, so we can understand its functionality in a broader context."
