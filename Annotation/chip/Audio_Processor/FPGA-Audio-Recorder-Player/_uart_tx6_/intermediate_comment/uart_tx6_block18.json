    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a flip-flop named \"data_present_flop\" in a UART transmitter module. The flip-flop uses data_present_value as data input, buffer_reset as reset signal, and clk as clock signal, and updates its output accordingly. The implementation uses a special attribute (HBLKNM) to help tools identify the block name and ensures synchronous behavior in correspondence with the clock signal."
