    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a D flip-flop named \"pointer3_flop\" in a UART transmitter module. The D input is the 3rd bit of \"pointer_value\", and it's output (Q) is the 3rd bit of \"pointer\". The flip-flop is reset (cleared) by the \"buffer_reset\" signal and it's clocked by the \"clk\" signal. Overall, it's used to update and store the current state of the 3rd bit of a pointer, determined by a certain condition as represented by \"pointer_value[3]\", and it is reset when the buffer_reset signal is active."
