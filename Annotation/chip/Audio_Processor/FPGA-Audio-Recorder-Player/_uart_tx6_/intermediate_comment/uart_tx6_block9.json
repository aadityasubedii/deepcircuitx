    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a part of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) transmission. Specifically, it includes a 6-input Look-Up Table (LUT6) and a Flip-Flop (FD). The LUT6 is initialized with a pre-determined bit pattern and its output is determined by the input signals (sm[0] to sm[3], data_present_int, and next_bit). The flip-flop is then used to store the current state of the LUT6 output, sm_value[3], on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk). This aids in asynchronously transmitting data over serial communication."
