    "block_comment": "This block of code highlights a specific implementation module of a UART transmitter, specifically a flip flop module labelled \"pointer2_flop\". The particular function of this block is data storage and propagation synchronized to the system clock. The flip flop (FDR) takes as input the third bit of 'pointer_value' array and transfers it to the 'pointer' array under the control of the system clock (clk). The reset input is controlled by 'buffer_reset', which allows the flip flop to be reset asynchronously."
