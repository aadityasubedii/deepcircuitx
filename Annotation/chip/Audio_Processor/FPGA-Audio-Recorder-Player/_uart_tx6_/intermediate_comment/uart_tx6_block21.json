    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a flip-flop for a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) transmitter module. In detail, it implements a D-type flip flop (`FDR`) named `pointer1_flop` with data input coming from `pointer_value[1]` and clock signal `clk`. It sets the output `pointer[1]` based on the data input at the rising edge of the clock signal. The flip flop will reset, and the output `pointer[1]` will go low, whenever `buffer_reset` is high. This is all accomplished within the constraints of the hardware block named `uart_tx6_1`."
