    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements two D flip-flops, both working in synchronous mode on the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`). The first flip-flop `next_flop` serves to store and output the value referred by `next_value` at each positive edge of `clk`, represented by `next_bit`. Similarly, the second flip-flop `read_flop` buffers the reading value (`buffer_read_value`) and its output is `buffer_read`. Both flip-flops are named as \"uart_tx6_3\", which can be flexibly organized as part of larger structures or modules in a design."
