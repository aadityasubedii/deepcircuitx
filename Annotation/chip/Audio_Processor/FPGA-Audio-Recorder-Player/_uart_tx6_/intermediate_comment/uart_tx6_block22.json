    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code delineates a look-up table (LUT) for a Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) transmitter module named \"uart_tx6_1\". It utilizes a 6-input LUT for Xilinx FPGAs, with a pre-defined initial configuration (64'hCC9060CCAA5050AA). The LUT receives inputs from variables like pointer[0], pointer[1], en_pointer, buffer_write, buffer_read, and a constant '1', and uses these inputs to generate outputs based on the LUT's initial configuration, outputting pointer_value[0] and pointer_value[1]."
