    "spec": "Module name: uart_tx6.\n\nModule specification: The uart_tx6 is a hardware module implemented in Verilog that models a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) transmitter with a 6-bit transfer mechanism. The functionality of this transmitter includes reading parallel data inputs, conversion to serial format, and transmission out. This module features an inbuilt buffer that can store and read data as necessitated by the 'buffer_write' and 'buffer_read' signals. The capacity of this buffer is indicated by 'buffer_full', 'buffer_half_full', and 'buffer_data_present'. This module supports varying baud rates controlled by the 'en_16_x_baud' signal.\n\nThe inputs of uart_tx6 are 'data_in' (8-bit parallel data input), 'buffer_write' (control for write into buffer), 'buffer_reset' (buffer reset control signal), 'en_16_x_baud' (baud rate controller), and 'clk' (module clock signal). The output ports of uart_tx6 are 'serial_out' (serialized version of input data), 'buffer_data_present' (data presence indicator in buffer), 'buffer_half_full' (status for half filled buffer), and 'buffer_full' (full buffer indicator).\n\nThe internal structure of uart_tx6 is made up of different blocks handling serialization, buffer management, and data transmission. Signal arrays like 'store_data' and 'data' temporarily hold the input data and distribute it. Control signals like 'pointer', 'en_pointer', 'zero', 'full_int', 'data_present_value', 'data_present_int' control the reading/writing from/to the buffer and indicating the data status. State machine signals 'sm' and baud rate controlling signals 'div' control the serialization of data and the speed of output, respectively. \n\nThe code is distinctly divided into several blocks like the state machine, buffer management, serialization, and baud rate controller. The state machine controls the data serialization process, buffer management handles storing, reading, and status signalling of the buffer, serialization block takes care of converting parallel data to serial form, and the baud rate controller manages the speed of transmission. The complexity of managing this operational mechanism is handled internally providing a simplistic interface to the user.",

It features a buffer system that can be written and read into, controlled by the respective buffer_write and buffer_read inputs.

Explanation: This is the parallel data input that needs to be serialized and transmitted.\n\n2. buffer_write: This is a single bit write control line for the buffer. Explanation: This control bit determines when the buffer should receive and store the input data.\n\n3. buffer_reset: This is a single bit reset control line for the buffer. Explanation: This control bit is used to reset the buffer.\n\n4. en_16_x_baud: This is a single bit line controlling the baud rate. Explanation: This control bit multiplies the bitrate by 16, hence determining the speed of the data transfer.\n\n5. clk: This is the clock signal.

This module reads parallel data inputs, converts them into serial data, and transmits them out. It features a buffer system that can be written and read into, controlled by the respective buffer_write and buffer_read inputs. Signals like buffer_full, buffer_half_full, and buffer_data_present provide the status of the buffer. This module also supports different baud rates controlled by the 'en_16_x_baud' signal. Serialization of the input data is controlled by the state machine 'sm' and the 'div' register. The output is given by the serial_out wire."

Explanation: This is the parallel data input that needs to be serialized and transmitted.\n\n2. buffer_write: This is a single bit write control line for the buffer. Explanation: This control bit determines when the buffer should receive and store the input data.\n\n3. buffer_reset: This is a single bit reset control line for the buffer. Explanation: This control bit is used to reset the buffer.\n\n4. en_16_x_baud: This is a single bit line controlling the baud rate. Explanation: This control bit multiplies the bitrate by 16, hence determining the speed of the data transfer.\n\n5. clk: This is the clock signal. Explanation: This clock signal is the main timing reference for all operations within the module.\n\nOutput ports:\n\n1. serial_out: This is the serialized output data line. Explanation: This line carries the serialized version of the input data out of the module.\n\n2. buffer_data_present: This is a signal that indicates if there is data in the buffer. Explanation: This signal goes high if the buffer has any data stored in it.\n\n3. buffer_half_full: This is a signal that indicates if the buffer is half full. Explanation: This signal goes high when the buffer is halfway filled.\n\n4. buffer_full: This is a signal that indicates if the buffer is full. Explanation: This signal goes high when the buffer is full and cannot store any more data."

The 'sm' signals are the state machine registers, which control the serialization of data.\n\n9.

The functionality of this transmitter includes reading parallel data inputs, conversion to serial format, and transmission out. This module features an inbuilt buffer that can store and read data as necessitated by the 'buffer_write' and 'buffer_read' signals. The capacity of this buffer is indicated by 'buffer_full', 'buffer_half_full', and 'buffer_data_present'. This module supports varying baud rates controlled by the 'en_16_x_baud' signal.\n\nThe inputs of uart_tx6 are 'data_in' (8-bit parallel data input), 'buffer_write' (control for write into buffer), 'buffer_reset' (buffer reset control signal), 'en_16_x_baud' (baud rate controller), and 'clk' (module clock signal). The output ports of uart_tx6 are 'serial_out' (serialized version of input data), 'buffer_data_present' (data presence indicator in buffer), 'buffer_half_full' (status for half filled buffer), and 'buffer_full' (full buffer indicator).\n\nThe internal structure of uart_tx6 is made up of different blocks handling serialization, buffer management, and data transmission. Signal arrays like 'store_data' and 'data' temporarily hold the input data and distribute it. Control signals like 'pointer', 'en_pointer', 'zero', 'full_int', 'data_present_value', 'data_present_int' control the reading/writing from/to the buffer and indicating the data status. State machine signals 'sm' and baud rate controlling signals 'div' control the serialization of data and the speed of output, respectively. \n\nThe code is distinctly divided into several blocks like the state machine, buffer management, serialization, and baud rate controller. The state machine controls the data serialization process, buffer management handles storing, reading, and status signalling of the buffer, serialization block takes care of converting parallel data to serial form, and the baud rate controller manages the speed of transmission. The complexity of managing this operational mechanism is handled internally providing a simplistic interface to the user."
