This module reads parallel data inputs, converts them into serial data, and transmits them out. It features a buffer system that can be written and read into, controlled by the respective buffer_write and buffer_read inputs. Signals like buffer_full, buffer_half_full, and buffer_data_present provide the status of the buffer. This module also supports different baud rates controlled by the 'en_16_x_baud' signal. Serialization of the input data is controlled by the state machine 'sm' and the 'div' register. The output is given by the serial_out wire."

Explanation: This is the parallel data input that needs to be serialized and transmitted.\n\n2. buffer_write: This is a single bit write control line for the buffer.

Explanation: This control bit is used to reset the buffer.\n\n4. en_16_x_baud: This is a single bit line controlling the baud rate.
