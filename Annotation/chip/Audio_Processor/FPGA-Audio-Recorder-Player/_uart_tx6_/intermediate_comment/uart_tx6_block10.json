    "block_comment": "The block of code is a part of a UART transmitter specifically handling the serial transmission of bits. This block primarily does the encoding of the six state machine values by using a Look-Up Table (LUT6) and the storing its outcome in a Flip-Flop (FD). The LUT6 block uses the state machine (sm), data_present_int, and next_bit as influencing inputs to create an output for sm_value[2]. The sm_value[2] is then stored in a Flip-Flop (FD), clocked by clk, to maintain and output the state (sm[2])."
