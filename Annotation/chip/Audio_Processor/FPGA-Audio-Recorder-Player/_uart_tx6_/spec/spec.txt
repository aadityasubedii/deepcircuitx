Module name: uart_tx6.

Module specification: The uart_tx6 is a hardware module implemented in Verilog that models a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) transmitter with a 6-bit transfer mechanism. The functionality of this transmitter includes reading parallel data inputs, conversion to serial format, and transmission out. This module features an inbuilt buffer that can store and read data as necessitated by the 'buffer_write' and 'buffer_read' signals. The capacity of this buffer is indicated by 'buffer_full', 'buffer_half_full', and 'buffer_data_present'. This module supports varying baud rates controlled by the 'en_16_x_baud' signal.

The inputs of uart_tx6 are 'data_in' (8-bit parallel data input), 'buffer_write' (control for write into buffer), 'buffer_reset' (buffer reset control signal), 'en_16_x_baud' (baud rate controller), and 'clk' (module clock signal). The output ports of uart_tx6 are 'serial_out' (serialized version of input data), 'buffer_data_present' (data presence indicator in buffer), 'buffer_half_full' (status for half filled buffer), and 'buffer_full' (full buffer indicator).

The internal structure of uart_tx6 is made up of different blocks handling serialization, buffer management, and data transmission. Signal arrays like 'store_data' and 'data' temporarily hold the input data and distribute it. Control signals like 'pointer', 'en_pointer', 'zero', 'full_int', 'data_present_value', 'data_present_int' control the reading/writing from/to the buffer and indicating the data status. State machine signals 'sm' and baud rate controlling signals 'div' control the serialization of data and the speed of output, respectively. 

The code is distinctly divided into several blocks like the state machine, buffer management, serialization, and baud rate controller. The state machine controls the data serialization process, buffer management handles storing, reading, and status signalling of the buffer, serialization block takes care of converting parallel data to serial form, and the baud rate controller manages the speed of transmission. The complexity of managing this operational mechanism is handled internally providing a simplistic interface to the user.
