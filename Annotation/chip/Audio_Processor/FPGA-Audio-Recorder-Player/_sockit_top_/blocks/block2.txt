Comment: 
This Verilog code block controls audio selection based on the value of the 'playback' signal. In the implementation, a clocked always block is used that triggers on the positive edge of the 'audio_clk'. Depending on the state of the 'playback' signal, it either amplifies the 'audio_in' or the 'audio_output' by a 'volume_control' factor. This result is then saved into the 'audio_selection' register for subsequent use or output.
