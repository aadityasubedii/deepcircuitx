Module-level comment: The 'sockit_top' module serves as an audio processing system, responsible for managing audio data and user controls. It uses external inputs like 'clk', 'playback', 'volume_control', 'audio_in', and internal signals like 'audio_selection', 'audio_output', 'audio_input', 'reset', 'main_clk', 'sample_end', 'sample_req'. Functionality is achieved via 'pll', 'i2c_av_config', 'audio_codec', and 'audio_effects' sub-modules, providing clock adjustments, I2C configuration, audio encoding, and effects application, respectively. The module handles audio input, outputs the processed audio, and offers controls like mute, volume adjustment, and audio source selection.
