The operation of this module relies on other modules (pll, i2c_av_config, audio_codec, and audio_effects). Notably, it integrates important components like clock management (pll), configuration via I2C (i2c_av_config), audio encoding (audio_codec) and audio effects application (audio_effects).

AUD_ADCDAT: This signal is taken as input which typically brings Audio Digital to Analog Converted Data to the module.\n\n5. KEY: This is the 4-bit input and can be seen as broad level control signals, likely originating from external sources such as buttons or switches.\n\n6. SW: Similarly, this is another 4-bit input broadly referred to as the Switch indicators for the system.\n\n7. audio_in: This audio input signal is a 16-bit signal and typically included from external devices such as microphones.\n\nExplanation: Input ports are those signals which are fed into the system for the system's operation, they are generally signals originated from outside of the system's boundary or some hierarchical higher system-controller.\n\nOutput Ports:\n\n1.
