    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns values to two signal wires, AUD_XCK and AUD_MUTE, in a digital audio system. It sets AUD_XCK to follow the state of audio_clk, which is a synchronizing clock signal for audio processing. The block also permanently enables the mute functionality of the audio system by assigning AUD_MUTE as binary 1, which suggests silence or no audio output."
