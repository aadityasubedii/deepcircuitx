The operation of this module relies on other modules (pll, i2c_av_config, audio_codec, and audio_effects). Notably, it integrates important components like clock management (pll), configuration via I2C (i2c_av_config), audio encoding (audio_codec) and audio effects application (audio_effects). The module also brings in options for volume controlling and audio routing."

It would typically be generated by an external oscillator or sometime from a higher controlled entity.\n\n2. playback: This determines whether the system either plays back the audio input or the audio generated by the system.\n\n3. volume_control: This 2-bit signal is used to control the volume of the audio input/output.\n\n4. AUD_ADCDAT: This signal is taken as input which typically brings Audio Digital to Analog Converted Data to the module.\n\n5. KEY: This is the 4-bit input and can be seen as broad level control signals, likely originating from external sources such as buttons or switches.\n\n6. SW: Similarly, this is another 4-bit input broadly referred to as the Switch indicators for the system.\n\n7. audio_in: This audio input signal is a 16-bit signal and typically included from external devices such as microphones.\n\nExplanation: Input ports are those signals which are fed into the system for the system's operation, they are generally signals originated from outside of the system's boundary or some hierarchical higher system-controller.\n\nOutput Ports:\n\n1. AUD_DACDAT: This is the output signal that carries the data converted from Digital to Analog Converter of Audio Data.\n\n2. AUD_XCK : This signal could be an output clock signal pertaining to the Audio clock domain.\n\n3. AUD_I2C_SCLK : This signal is the I2C clock signal for audio. It is defined as output from sockit_top module.\n\n4. AUD_MUTE : This output signal is used as an indication for audio mute control.\n\n5. PLL_LOCKED : A status flag that signifies that the phase-locked loop (PLL) has locked on to the input frequency.\n\n6. audio_out : This audio output signal is 16-bit wide and would typically be sent to external devices such as speakers.\n\n7. audio_clk: This is an output clock signal specifically used for the audio data path both inside and outside this system.\n\nExplanation: Output ports are those signals which are produced as results/outputs/status of the system, they would be either utilised by external devices, shown to the user, or sent to other systems for consumption."
