Module name: sockit_top.

Module specification: The sockit_top module implements an audio processing system in Verilog, responsible for audio input, output, volume control, and audio routing functions. The module comprises several input ports: 'clk' that receives the main clock signal, 'playback' that controls audio playback mode, 'volume_control' used to adjust the volume level, 'AUD_ADCDAT' representing Audio Digital to Analog Converted Data, 'KEY' and 'SW' indicating control signals from buttons or switches, and 'audio_in' channeling the audio signal from an external source. Output ports of the module include 'AUD_DACDAT' for output audio data, 'AUD_XCK' for the audio clock signal, 'AUD_I2C_SCLK' handling I2C clock for audio, 'AUD_MUTE' for mute control, 'PLL_LOCKED' indicating the PLL status, 'audio_out' transferring the audio signal to an outside recipient, and 'audio_clk' serving as the output clock for the audio path. 

The internal signals consist of 'audio_selection' for choosing the audio source, 'audio_output' and 'audio_input' for audio data before and after effect processing, 'reset' for system resetting functions, 'main_clk' for the main clock signal, 'sample_end' controlling the end of audio sampling, and 'sample_req' for new audio sample requests. The module consists of various components: 'pll' for clock management, 'i2c_av_config' for I2C configuration, 'audio_codec' encoding the audio, and 'audio_effects' applying certain audio effects. The module's operation relies on all these internal signals and components to effectively process audio data and provide needed controls to the user.
