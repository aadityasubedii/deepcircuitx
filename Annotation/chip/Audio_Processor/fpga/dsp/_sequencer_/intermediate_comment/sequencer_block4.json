    "block_comment": "This block assigns values to `out_audio` and `out_addr` based on the conditional wire `out_we`. If `out_we` asserts true, `out_audio` gets assigned the value of `shift_out` and `out_addr` is assigned the bits from `out_addr_2` with width defined by `CHAN_W`. When `out_we` is false, both get assigned 0. The block leverages ternary operators for value assignment under different conditions."
