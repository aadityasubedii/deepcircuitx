    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is used for initialization of certain variables at the start of the simulation. The `coef_addr` variable is set to 0, which is presumably used as an address for coefficient memory access. `error` variable is set to 1, possibly indicating a default error state (error present). Also, `out_we` and `capture_out` are set to 0, probably indicating that by default, there is no write enable to the output data register and output data isn't captured."
