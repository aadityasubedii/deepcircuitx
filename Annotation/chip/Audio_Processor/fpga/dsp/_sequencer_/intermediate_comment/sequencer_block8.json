    "block_comment": "This line of code is performing an assign operation. The function 'assign' is used in this block to continuously pass the value of 'mul_out' to the 'acc_in' variable. As it's a wire assignment, any changes in the value of 'mul_out' will instantly impact 'acc_in'. This digital wire interconnectedness is a commonly used feature in Verilog for controlling the flow of data."
