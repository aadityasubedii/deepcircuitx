    "block_comment": "The function of this block of code is to perform a synchronous update of the 'gain_0' signal value with respect to the 'gain' signal upon positive edge of a clock signal 'ck'. In more detail - whenever there's a rising edge in the 'ck' (clock) signal, this code block captures the value of 'gain' at that moment and sets the 'gain_0' with this value which makes its operation synchronous with the clock signal."
