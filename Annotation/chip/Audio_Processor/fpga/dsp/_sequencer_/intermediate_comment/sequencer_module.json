    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'sequencer' module controls a digital signal processing flow by receiving and processing various inputs including clock, reset signals, frame data, coefficient and audio data. It manages tasks efficiently through signals like 'op_code', 'offset', etc., that control different operations in the system. The module comprises blocks for initial setup, parsing and executing operation codes, address management for audio data, manipulating accumulator operations, managing a variable delay with a shifting mechanism. It checks output write enable function, manages audio output, and handles errors. The 'done' output signals the completion of all operations."
