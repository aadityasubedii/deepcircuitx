    "block_comment": "This Verilog block of code controls the resetting and incrementing of an address called 'coef_addr' using a clock cycle. Every time a positive edge of the clock is detected ('posedge ck'), it checks for a reset signal as well as checking if a 'done_req' has not been sent ('!done_req'). If both conditions are true, it increments 'coef_addr' by 1. Otherwise, if any one or both of the conditions is false, it resets 'coef_addr' to 0. The code block thus manipulates 'coef_addr' based on system clock events and control signals."
