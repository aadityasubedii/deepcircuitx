It's responsible for receiving different types of input such as clock signals, reset signals, frame data among others. It also handles the tasks of operating different types of coding operations and managing multipliers and accumulators - using these to perform multiply-accumulate operations. These are fundamental for many digital signal processing algorithms. It has control tasks that direct the operation of different functional units such as `noop()`, `mac()`, `halt()`, `save()`, `err()`, `capture()`, with each task altering different control signals. The module also includes buffers for the gain and address values, as well as managing the output of the audio data. It also contains the ability to handle errors and manages several types of data such as addresses, gain values, and audio data. The done output is used to indicate when all operations are completed."

It signals an error condition when high.\n4. `done`: This is the done signal. It indicates when all operations are completed.\n5. `out_addr`: This is the output address. The output data (out_audio) is written to this address.\n6. `out_audio`: This is the output audio data. The processed audio data is written to this port.\n7. `out_we`: This is the write enable output.
