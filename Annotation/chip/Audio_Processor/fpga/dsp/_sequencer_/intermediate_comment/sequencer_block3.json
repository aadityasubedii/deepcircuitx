    "block_comment": "This block declares a wire named done_delay. The primary function of this wire is to serve as a conduit for transmitting logic signals between hardware elements in the Verilog RTL design. As it stands, this wire will adopt its value based on the logic it's connected to and can potentially represent a control or data signal. The exact function of done_delay depends on how it's utilized within the larger context of the design. Much like a conduit, the wire doesn't itself perform any operations but carries the result of operations performed elsewhere in the design. No specific implementation detail can be provided based on the single line code."
