    "block_comment": "This block of code instantiates a pipeline delay of length 4. It takes in 'done_req' as input and provides 'done_delay' as output using the clock signal 'ck'. The pipeline delay is implemented using the parameterizable Verilog module 'pipe' where 'LENGTH' provides the number of stages in the pipeline. The operations within the pipeline are synchronized to the clock signal, thereby introducing a delay of 4 clock cycles between the input 'done_req' and output 'done_delay'."
