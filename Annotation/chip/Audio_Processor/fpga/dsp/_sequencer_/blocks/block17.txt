The function of the block is to manage the read address (`audio_raddr_0`) of an audio-related data structure in a synchronous manner. The block works by assigning the value of `audio_raddr`, presumably the next read address, to `audio_raddr_0` every time there is a rising edge in the clock signal (`ck`). This implementation ensures synchronization with the system clock, thus facilitating orderly and controlled data access, which is particularly crucial in audio processing.
