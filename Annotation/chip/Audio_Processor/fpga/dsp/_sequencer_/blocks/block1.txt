This block assigns the logical AND operation of 'done_delay' and 'done_req' to the signal 'done'. The purpose of this block is to create a control signal 'done' that becomes high only when both 'done_delay' and 'done_req' are high. If either 'done_delay' or 'done_req' is not high, 'done' will be low. This helps to synchronize the system, ensuring that 'done' is only asserted when both conditions 'done_delay' and 'done_req' are met.
