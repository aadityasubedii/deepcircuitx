Comment: 
This block of Verilog code primarily handles control signal management. The task `save` is designed to disable certain operations and enable output operation. Specifically, it deactivates the accumulator's enable, reset and addition requests by setting `acc_en_req`, `acc_rst_req` and `acc_add_req` signals to 0. Meanwhile, it ensures that the output enable request `out_en_req` is activated by setting it to 1.
