Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages a pipeline for the propagation of an address signal. In each clock cycle (on the positive edge of the clock signal 'ck'), the output address 'out_addr_0' is updated with information from the 'gain_1' array, specifically the lower-order bits specified by 'CHAN_W'. Following this initial assignment, the values of 'out_addr_0' and 'out_addr_1' are then sequentially propagated to 'out_addr_1' and 'out_addr_2' respectively.
