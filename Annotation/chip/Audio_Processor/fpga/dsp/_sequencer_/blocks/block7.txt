This block implements a 4-stage pipeline using shift registers. Based on the positive edge of the clock signal, the current 'offset' variable is moved to 'shift_0', the current 'shift_0' is moved to 'shift_1', the current 'shift_1' is moved to 'shift_2', and the current 'shift_2' is moved to 'shift_3'. This chained operation is essentially creating a delay line or pipeline where the data flows from 'offset' to 'shift_3' in four clock cycles.
