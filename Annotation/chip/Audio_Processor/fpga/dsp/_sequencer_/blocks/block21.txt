This block serves as a Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit controller. It sets various control signals that decide whether to reset, add, or just maintain the state of the accumulator block. Specifically, acc_en_req is activated to enable the accumulator, acc_rst_req is asserted when the zero input is received to reset the accumulator, and acc_add_req is used to signal the accumulator to add when the add signal is true. Furthermore, out_en_req is cleared to disengage the output stage.
