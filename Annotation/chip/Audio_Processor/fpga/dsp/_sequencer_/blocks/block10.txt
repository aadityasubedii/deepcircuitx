Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for registering the negative signal value from an audio signal (neg_audio) on the rising edge of the clock (ck). It uses an always block sensitive to the positive edge of the clock, meaning the code inside of it only gets executed when the clock signal transitions from 0 to 1. Thus, whenever there is a clock cycle, the current value of neg_audio is stored in the negative register.
