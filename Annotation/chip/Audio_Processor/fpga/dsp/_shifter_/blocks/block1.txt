Comment: 
The block is a synchronous data load mechanism. When the positive edge of the clock signal (ck) arrives, the system checks if the enable signal (en) is asserted. If it is, the 'shifted' value is placed onto the output signal 'out'. The implementation uses an edge-triggered mechanism to synchronize the data load with the clock signal.
