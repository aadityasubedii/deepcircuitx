The module shifts the input bits to the right based on a shift count provided as an input parameter. The output width and input width are parameterized and can be set during instantiation of the module. The shift operation is only enabled when the 'en' signal is high, and all operations are synchronized with the rising edge of the 'ck' signal. The shifted value is stored in the 'out' register. This module can be used for mathematical operations, such as multiplication and division by powers of two, or for performing bit manipulation operations."

All operations inside the shifter module are synchronized with the positive edge of this clock signal. \n2. `en`: This is the enable signal. The shift operation and variable update only occur when this signal is high.\n3. `shift`: This is a SHIFT_W-wide bus that specifies the number of places to shift the input. For example, if `shift` is 3, the input will be shifted right by 3 bits.\n4. `in`: This is the input wire on which IN_W-bit wide data is sent for the shifting operation.\n\nOutput Ports: \n\n1. `out`: This is the output register where the shifted value is stored after the shift operation. It's size is OUT_W-wide. The shifted data is only stored in this register on the positive-edge clock cycle when the enable signal is high.\n\nInside the module, there's one more wire for internal operation: \n\n`shifted`: This is only used internally inside the module.
