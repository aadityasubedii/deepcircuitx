    "block_comment": "This function is a register read function for a custom hardware block. It accepts a 3-bit address and returns a 32-bit data from the corresponding register. Inside, it employs a case statement to decode the 3-bit input address and then retrieves data from the corresponding register. Certain insignificant bits are padded with zeros to form 32-bit output data, while for address '6' it directly returns the status register, and for address '7' it pads the reg_match data with 8 zeros on the left."
