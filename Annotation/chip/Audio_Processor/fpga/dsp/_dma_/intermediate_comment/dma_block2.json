    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a conditional assignment on the dma_dat signal. The value of the dma_ack signal determines the value assigned to dma_dat: if dma_ack is true (or high), the value assigned to dma_dat is data_out; otherwise, if dma_ack is false (or low), the value assigned to dma_dat is 0."
