    "block_comment": "This block represents a synchronous memory-mapped I/O register block in a Verilog RTL design. It responds to a positive edge of a clock signal or a reset signal. When writing to the registers and not reset, it sets the value of different registers according to the address provided on the I/O bus. Registers can hold values related to addresses, steps, cycles, blocks, start request, repeat flag, and match. There is a special behavior handling a 'transfer done' condition with repetition when the system is running, alternating the start request flag. In contrast, upon a reset event, it clears all registers to their default state."
