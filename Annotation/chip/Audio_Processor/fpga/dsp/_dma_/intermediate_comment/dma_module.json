    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"dma\" module facilitates high-speed, processor-bypassed transfers between memory and devices. Input ports initiate and dictate transfer parameters, while output ports relay DMA and transfer status. Internal signals connect internal components and manage tasks such as data routing, read/write operations, block transfer control, and addressing. Core code constructs (writing block, status assignment, rdt function, reading block, running block) control the timing of operations, track status, determine read/write conditions, and manage addresses and cycles during operations, collaboratively ensuring efficient memory management."
