    "block_comment": "This line of code is responsible for assigning a value to the 'reading' variable, which indicates whether a reading operation is currently taking place within the code execution. This is achieved by using a bitwise AND operation between 'cs_ack' and the bitwise negation of 'wb_dbus_we'. 'reading' is set to true (1) if 'cs_ack' is true and 'wb_dbus_we' is false, suggesting that the chip is acknowledging but not writing, hence a read is inferred. Otherwise, 'reading' is set to false (0)."
