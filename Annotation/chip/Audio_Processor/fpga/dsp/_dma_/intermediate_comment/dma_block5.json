    "block_comment": "The block of code declares a 32-bit wire named `data_out`. This wire can be used to carry the output data from one hardware component to another within the system. The range [31:0] indicates that it is a 32-bit bus with indices ranging from 0 to 31. The communication via this bus follows a unidirectional flow, as indicated by the `wire` type in Verilog."
