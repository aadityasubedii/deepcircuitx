    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for defining a status signal in a hardware system. Its implementation is through a 32-bit wire, 'status', as an aggregation of various flag signals. This includes 'xfer_match', 'block_done', and 'xfer_done' flags, where 'xfer_match' indicates a transfer match has occurred, 'block_done' signals the completion of block processing, and 'xfer_done' specifies the end of a data transfer. These flags are concatenated with 29 high-zero bits to form the full status signal."
