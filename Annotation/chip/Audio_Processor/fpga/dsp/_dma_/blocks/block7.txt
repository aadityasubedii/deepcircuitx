Comment: 
This code block is a simple data bus acknowledgment signal assignment in a hardware design. The assigned signal, `dbus_ack`, reflects the status of the 'chip select' acknowledgment, `cs_ack`. This one-liner Verilog RTL code essentially propagates the acknowledgment signal state from the chip select to the data bus. Sequential or combinational logic might handle the `cs_ack` signal elsewhere in the design. In this context, acknowledgment signals are typically used to coordinate data communication, ensuring data is successfully received or ready to be received.
