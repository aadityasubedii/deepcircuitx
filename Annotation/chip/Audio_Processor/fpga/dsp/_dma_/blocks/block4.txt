Comment: 
This block selects a particular 16-bit portion of a 32-bit data word to output based on the second bit of an address. The ternary operator (?:) is used as a control measure through which a portion of data to be outputted is selected. If the second bit of the address, addr[1], is high, the upper 16 bits of the data_out will be xfer_dat and the lower 16 bits will be zero; otherwise, the lower 16 bits will be xfer_dat and the upper 16 bits will have zero value.
