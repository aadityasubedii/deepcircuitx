    "block_comment": "This block of code is a clock generator. It uses the \"always\" keyword in Verilog to continuously toggle the state of the signal 'ck' every 42 time units, effectively generating a clock signal with a period of 84 time units. The 'ck' signal is being internally inverted via '!ck' at each time interval to create this alternating high and low state required for a clock signal."
