    "block_comment": "The function 'twosc' is tasked with calculating the two's complement of a given signed 16-bit input 'a'. The implementation of this function leverages a conditional operator (?:) to check the most significant bit (bit 15) of the input. If this bit is set (indicating 'a' is negative for signed numbers), the function calculates and returns the two's complement of 'a', by inverting 'a' (~a), adding 1 to the result, otherwise, it simply returns 'a' for positive numbers."
