    "module": "Module-level comment: This 'tb' module serves as a test bench for simulation and validation of DSP modules namely shift, agc, and gain. It creates and manipulates internal signals like 'ck' (clock), 'shift_by', 'shift_in', 'shift_out' (shift-related), 'en' (agc enable), 'mic_0' to 'mic_3' (simulated microphone inputs), 'in_0' to 'in_3' and 'out_0' to 'out_3' (gain data controls), among others. By systematically stimulating these modules and asserting their outputs against expected values, it verifies module functionalities for correctness and robustness."
