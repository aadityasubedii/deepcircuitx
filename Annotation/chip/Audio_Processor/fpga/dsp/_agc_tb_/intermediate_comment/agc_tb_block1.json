    "block_comment": "This block configures and activates the 'gain_run' module twice. It starts by waiting for two clock edges, then sets the `gain_gain` to maximum and initializes the inputs `in_0`, `in_1`, `in_2`, and `in_3` to specific values. Afterwards, it runs 'gain_run' and displays a calculation based on `in_0` and `gain_gain`. The same process is repeated, with a difference in `in_3` value for the second run."
