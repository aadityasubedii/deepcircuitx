    "block_comment": "This block of code functions to simulate a shift register in a test bench environment. Initially, the 'shift_in' value is set to '24'h123456'. At each subsequent positive clock edge, the shift register is shifted a certain amount, defined by 'shift_by', and a test assertion checks if the output of the shift register, 'shift_out', is identical to the expected value (which includes a masked shift of the 'shift_in' value). The block continuously does this for different shift values from 0 to 7, providing a comprehensive test of the shift register design."
