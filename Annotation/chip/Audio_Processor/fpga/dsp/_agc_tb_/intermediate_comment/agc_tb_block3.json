    "block_comment": "The function mul16 performs 16-bit signed multiplication of two inputs. It first detects the sign of input 'a' and calculates its two's complement if 'a' is negative. The function implements multiplication using conditional statement based on the sign of 'a', before returning the final product. If the sign is negative, it performs two's complement of the product; otherwise, it returns the product as is."
