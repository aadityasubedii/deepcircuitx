    "block_comment": "The block of code is a function in Verilog that retrieves and returns the values of different 'mic' according to the input address. The function 'get_mic' accepts a 2-bit input 'addr' and returns a 24-bit output, representing the respective 'mic' value. The selection of 'mic' takes place through a case statement that handles 4 possible 'addr' inputs (from 0 to 3) and returns the respective 'mic' (mic_0, mic_1, mic_2, mic_3). Any other 'addr' input will result in an 'x' output due to the absence of a default command in the case statement."
