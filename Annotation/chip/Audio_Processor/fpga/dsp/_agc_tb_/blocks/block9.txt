The task block labeled 'go' is essentially a control mechanism for a specific process in the Verilog design. The implementation employs a signal 'en' which is initially set to '1'. This initiates the procedure on the subsequent clock edge, as per the statement '@(posedge ck)'. Once this procedure is done, 'en' is reset to '0' on the next rising edge of the clock, effectively ending the operation.
