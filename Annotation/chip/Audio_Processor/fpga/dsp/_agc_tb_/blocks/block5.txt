Comment: 
The block of code represents a hardware task that controls the operation of a gain calculation module. The task, when called, activates the 'gain_en' signal to initiate the gain calculation operation on the next clock edge. After asserting the signal, it is then de-asserted on the next clock edge, and finally, the task waits for the 'gain_done' signal, suggesting that the computation is done before it proceeds, ensuring proper sequential and synchronous operation.
