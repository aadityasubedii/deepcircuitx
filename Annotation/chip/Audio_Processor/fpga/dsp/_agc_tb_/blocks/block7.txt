The block of code acts as a multiplexer, selecting one of multiple inputs to drive to the output based on the value of the gain_addr address signal. Specifically, it uses a chain of conditional (ternary) operators to select and assign one of the input signals (in_0, in_1, in_2, in_3) to the gain_in_data output depending on the value (0 to 3) of the gain_addr signal.
