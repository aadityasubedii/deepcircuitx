Comment: 
This block of code functions as a multiplexer, routing the input 'gain_out_data' to one of the four output lines 'out_0' to 'out_3'. The multiplexer operation is controlled by the 'gain_out_addr' signal, which dictates the specific output line to activate on the clock's rising edge, only if 'gain_out_we' is high. The data is latched onto the chosen output at the positive edge of the 'ck' clock signal.
