This block of Verilog code triggers simulation activities and enables waveform generation for debugging purposes. At the onset, it starts by specifying the file ("dsp.vcd") where the waveform data will be dumped. The entire testbench (`tb`) is included in the dumping scope with `$dumpvars(0, tb);`. To control simulation runtime and prevent potentially infinite running, it introduces a delay of 5000000 time units after which the simulation finishes (`$finish`).
