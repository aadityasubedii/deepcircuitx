Module name: tb. 

Module specification: The 'tb' module is a test bench specifically designed for simulating and testing various functionalities of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) modules such as shift, gain, and Automatic Gain Control (agc). This module uses internal signals and other means but does not have external input or output ports because it is a top-level module intended for simulation and testing. The module uses signals like 'ck' (clock), 'shift_by', 'shift_in', 'shift_out' (shift data controls), 'en' (enable for agc functionality), 'mic_0' to 'mic_3' (simulated microphone signals), 'in_0' to 'in_3' (input data), 'out_0' to 'out_3' (output data), 'gain_en', 'gain_gain' among others. These signals are utilized to stimulate, control, and validate various operations of the DSP modules under test.

The test bench code can be sectioned into various parts for easier understanding. In the first part, the shifting operation is simulated by changing inputs 'shift_by' and 'shift_in' and the result of operation is checked at 'shift_out'. In the second part, the 'agc' module is stimulated by changing the values at four simulated microphones, 'mic_0' to 'mic_3', and the level and output is checked for its correctness, using tb_assertions. In the third part, the 'gain' module is simulated using input data 'in_0' to 'in_3', the gain setting is controlled by 'gain_gain', and the output data is checked for its correctness. This comprehensive test bench allows thorough and detailed validation of the DSP modules under test, ensuring their accuracy and robustness.
