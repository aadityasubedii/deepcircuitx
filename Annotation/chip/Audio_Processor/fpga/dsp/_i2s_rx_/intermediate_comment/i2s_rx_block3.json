    "block_comment": "The block of code dynamically configures a digital logic mask and a midpoint based on the number of clocks being used in the system. It checks if the number of clocks is either 64 or 32. If the number of clocks is 64, the mask is set to the binary value '111111' and the midpoint is set to 32. Similarly, if the number of clocks is 32, the mask is set to '011111' and the midpoint is set to 16. These values can be used for setting threshold values or decision points in subsequent logic."
