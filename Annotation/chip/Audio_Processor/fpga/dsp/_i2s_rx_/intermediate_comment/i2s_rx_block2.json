    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily handles the process of edge mask calculation. The left edge bit-mask is calculated by bit-wise AND operation between MASK and the sum of 1 with BITS. Similarly, the bit-mask for the right edge is computed through a bit-wise AND operation between MASK and the sum of 1, BITS, and a middle point variable. The final line of the block is responsible for calculating the current frame position with the help of a bitwise AND operation with MASK."
