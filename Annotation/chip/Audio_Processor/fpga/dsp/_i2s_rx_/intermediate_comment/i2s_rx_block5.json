    "block_comment": "This block initializes the variable 'left' to zero at the start of simulation. It's a single line of code but it's essential to set the initial state of 'left' to ensure correct operation of logic that utilizes this variable. The 'initial' keyword in Verilog is used to set up initial conditions for variables in the simulation, and it only executes once at time 0 of simulation."
