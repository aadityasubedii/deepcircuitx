I2S, short for Inter-IC Sound, is a communication protocol that is used mainly in digital audio applications. The 'i2s_rx' module reads input serial data (SD) and outputs the received data as left and right channel data. The functionality of the module is steered by a clock input (ck) and a sample validity signal (sample). A frame position signal (frame_posn) is also used to select when the left and right channels' data are latched. Parameterization of the number of bits (BITS) and clock cycles (CLOCKS) allows flexibility for different data formats."

If set, the module knows that it should process the data on the 'sd' line.\n3. frame_posn: Explanation: This is the frame position signal.

One bit is shifted in on each rising clock edge when the 'sample' signal is high. The latest received data is stored in this variable.\n\n2. EOW_LEFT and EOW_RIGHT: These are wire signals used to identify the frame position corresponding to the end of the word for the left channel (EOW_LEFT) and the right channel (EOW_RIGHT). They are assigned values by masking (using the MASK wire) the sum of the BITS parameter and 1 (for EOW_LEFT), and the sum of the BITS parameter, midpoint, and 1 (for EOW_RIGHT).\n\n3. MASK: This wire signal is used to create masks that decide the structure of the I2S frame, based on the specified number of clock cycles (CLOCKS). When CLOCKS=64, the MASK is \"all ones\", when CLOCKS=32, the MASK has one less bit. The MASK is used in deciding the EOW_LEFT, EOW_RIGHT, and frame signals.\n\n4. frame: This wire signal stores the current frame position (provided by frame_posn input) masked with the MASK signal. It is used to determine when to latch the data into left and right output variables.\n\n5. midpoint: This signal determines the midpoint of the I2S frame, based on the number of clock cycles (CLOCKS). The midpoint value is used to calculate EOW_RIGHT."
