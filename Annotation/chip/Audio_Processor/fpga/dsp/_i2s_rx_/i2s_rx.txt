Module-level comment: The 'i2s_rx' module functions as an I2S receiver, processing serial data input and outputting left and right channel data based on sample validity and clock synchronization. Internally, using shift register, data is accumulated. Input frame position is tracked to determine when to latch the data. Two essential signals, 'EOW_LEFT' and 'EOW_RIGHT', are utilized to indicate when the left and right channels data respectively end. Module uses generated 'MASK' signal and derived midpoint value to correctly structure and divide the I2S frame.
