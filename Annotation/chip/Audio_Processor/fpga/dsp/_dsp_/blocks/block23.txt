Comment: 
This block of code assigns value of the third bit in the `scale` array to the `ck` variable. This operation is carried out using an `assign` statement, which is used in Verilog for continuous assignments. Such assignments are calculated whenever the right-hand side of the statement changes, thus the value of `ck` will change whenever the third bit of `scale` is modified.
