This block of Verilog code module increases the value of the 'scale' variable at each positive edge of the 'pll_ck' clock signal. It utilizes the 'always @' construct to monitor changes in 'pll_ck', and encapsulated in a begin-end block to sequentially order the operation, giving it synchronous behaviour.
