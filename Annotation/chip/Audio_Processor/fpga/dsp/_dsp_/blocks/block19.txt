Comment: 
The given block of code in the Verilog RTL pertains to the de-assertion of the reset request signal. This segment of code is executed if the conditions for a reset requirement are not met in the prior evaluation, subsequently setting the 'reset_req' signal to logical '0', indicating that a reset request is not necessary at this point. This mechanism is realized through the use of the 'assign' keyword applied to the 'reset_req' signal, explicitly de-asserting it.
