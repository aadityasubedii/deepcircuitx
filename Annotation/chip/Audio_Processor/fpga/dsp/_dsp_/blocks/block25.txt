Comment: 
The block of code generates a conditional clock signal. It creates a wire 'ck' and then depending on a condition 'RUN_SLOW', it instantiates a register called 'scale' with an initial value of zero. If 'RUN_SLOW' is true, scale is defined, which could be potentially used to modify the clock signal, effectively forming a scaled or slowed clock. The specific implementation and use of scale isn't clear without the rest of the code.
