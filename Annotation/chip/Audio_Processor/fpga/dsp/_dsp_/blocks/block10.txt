Comment: 
This block of code describes the instantiation of a SK9822 peripheral for LED controls in a Verilog design. The SK9822 peripheral is parameterized with the address of the LED ("LED_ADDR"). It interfaces with a wishbone (wb) compatible bus where it takes in signals such as clock ("wb_clk"), reset ("wb_rst"), cycle start signal ("wb_dbus_cyc"), write-enable signal ("wb_dbus_we"), address bus signal ("wb_dbus_adr"), and data bus signal ("wb_dbus_dat"). These signals allow the peripheral to properly process and execute commands to manipulate the LED. It outputs an acknowledgment signal ("ack") and sends the clock ("led_ck") and data ("led_data") to the LED module.
