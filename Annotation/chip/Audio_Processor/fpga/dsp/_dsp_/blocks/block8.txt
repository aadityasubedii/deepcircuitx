The block functions as an instantiation of an ibus_read module with an address defined as FLASH_ADDR. It reads from a flash memory through the wishbone (wb) bus protocols like wb_clk, wb_rst and coordinates the cyclical nature, acknowledgment of data transmission, data read and write, and device bus interaction. Moreover, it handles interrupt bus cycles, data transfer acknowledgments and accomplished this via the wb_ibus_cyc, wb_ibus_ack signals respectively. The instantiated module further signals the operational status of the flash memory using the dev_busy signal.
