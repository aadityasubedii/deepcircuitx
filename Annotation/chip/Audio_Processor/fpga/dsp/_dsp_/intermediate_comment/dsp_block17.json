    "block_comment": "This block defines an instantiation of a chip select module for a RAM chip with a defined address and width. Using a bus cycle signal (wb_cyc), address signal (addr), and chip reset signal (wb_rst), the module verifies when an access operation is made to the RAM at a given address. Upon verification, it notifies by sending acknowledgement signal (ack) and assigns the acknowledgment signal to an external module to indicate the completion of the operation."
