    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for assigning default values to certain variables (Function of the block). It does this by explicitly setting timer_ack, timer_irq, and timer_rdt to zero using the assign keyword, a continuous assignment statement that creates a path between the left-hand-side (lhs) and right-hand-side (rhs) expressions. This assignment is active throughout the operation of the block representing a digital wire in hardware (Implementation details of the block)."
