    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'dsp' module is a digital signal processor controller using GPIO, UART, Timer, Flash Memory, and IRQ peripherals. It operates by accepting inputs through SPI and an external clock and outputs data via SPI, LED, and UART. The module uses conditional compiling to adjust its functionalities. It features internal hierarchies, calling several other modules such as a PLL for clock signal generation and serv_rf_top as the main RTL CPU code. It effectively handles interrupt requests, timer functionalities, and data bus arbitration, playing a critical role in the microcontroller's operations.\n"
