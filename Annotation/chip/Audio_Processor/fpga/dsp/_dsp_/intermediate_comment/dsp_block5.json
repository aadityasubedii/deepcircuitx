    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code configures components to enable an audio engine when the macro `USE_AUDIO_ENGINE` is defined. It contains various wires to setup interfacing such as engine acknowledgment, read data from the engine, as well as status flags for DMA transactions like completion and matching signals. Additionally, it assigns predefined signals to output variables. The 'audio_engine' module is instantiated with a clock rate configuration parameter and a group of input-output connections such as clock, reset, and wishbone interface signals for data communication, signal acknowledgments and DMA related signals."
