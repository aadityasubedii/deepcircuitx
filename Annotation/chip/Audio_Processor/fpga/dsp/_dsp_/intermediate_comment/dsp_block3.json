    "block_comment": "This block of code pertains to the implementation of an interrupt request register in a system-on-chip design. The register, with a 3-bit width and an address specified by IRQ_ADDR, interacts with the wishbone bus protocol via specific signal lines, including clock, reset, address, data, write enable, and cycle signals. This register handles both the received interrupt requests (irq_in) and the system-on-chip output interrupt signal (soc_irq). The read and acknowledgment related outputs for the register are handled through the rdt and ack pins, respectively.\n"
