    "block_comment": "This block of code instantiates a Wishbone-compliant bus interface for SPI communication, named 'ibus'. The interface is clocked with 'ck' and can be reset using 'rst'. Address, read data, cycle and acknowledgement signals are interfaced via 's_adr', 's_rdt', 's_cyc' and 's_ack' respectively. The SPI signals 'spi_cs', 'spi_sck', 'spi_miso' and 'spi_mosi' are used for SPI communication. The 'ibus_ready' signal indicates the readiness of the 'ibus'."
