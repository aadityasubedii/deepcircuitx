    "block_comment": "This block of code is a part of a larger conditional statement, where certain signals are assigned based on some other inputs. It carries out the function of routings, selectively altering the values of the core signals depending on certain conditions. Here, the 'x_' prefixed signals are assigned the values of 'wb_dbus_' prefixed signals, with the '_ack' and '_rdt' signals also modified accordingly. This ensures the synchronization of data and acknowledgement signals across the system. The dma_ack and dma_rdt are hardcoded as '0', meaning the DMA operation is not acknowledged during this condition."
