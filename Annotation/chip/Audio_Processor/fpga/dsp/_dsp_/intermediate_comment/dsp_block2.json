    "block_comment": "This block of code implements the functionality of forming two buses: bus_rdt and bus_ack by combining corresponding signals from multiple different hardware modules (interrupt line, timer, RAM, UART, GPIO, flash memory, computation engine, and LED controller). The respective *_rdt and *_ack signals from each module are combined using the bitwise OR operator, allowing multiple simultaneous signals to pass through, implementing a kind of 'wired OR' function, traditionally used for creating collective bus signals in hardware design practices."
