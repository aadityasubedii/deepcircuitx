    "block_comment": "This block initializes an instance of serv_rf_top, a RISC-V CPU core, with a specified RESET_PC and Control Status Register (CSR). It is interlinked with a Wishbone bus for communication. Regarding the implementation details, the block of code interacts with individual data bus (DBus) and instruction bus (IBus). Both buses handle address, cycle, and acknowledge signals for effective communication. Additionally, the DBus also handles select, write enable, and data signals, thus signifying its capability to write and correspondingly address specific data portions."
