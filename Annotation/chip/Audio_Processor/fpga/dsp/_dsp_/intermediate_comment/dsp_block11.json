    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents the instantiation of a general purpose input/output (GPIO) module with an address width of 8 bits. The GPIO module interfaces with a wishbone bus that handles the communication with the module. Signals like wb_clk and wb_rst are used for clock and reset of the wishbone bus, while wb_dbus_adr, wb_dbus_dat, wb_dbus_sel, wb_dbus_we are for addressing, data, select, and write enable signals of the data bus. The GPIO register itself is connected to the gpio_reg port. This model operates on positive edge of the clock and resets when wb_rst signal is pulled high. Finally, the gpio_ack signal acts as an acknowledgment for bus requests."
