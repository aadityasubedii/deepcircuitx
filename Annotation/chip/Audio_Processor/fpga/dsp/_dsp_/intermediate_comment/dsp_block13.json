    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for the generation of the baud rate for a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) module. It specifically uses a wire named 'baud_en' that acts as the baud rate clock for the UART operation. Baud rate here is derived by dividing the system clock frequency (CK_HZ) with the baud rate value (115200). The module 'uart_baud' is parameterized with this derived baud value and its clock input is connected to 'wb_clk', while the baud rate clock output is connected to 'baud_en'."
