    "spec": "Module name: i2s_clock. \n\nModule specification: The i2s_clock module is a fundamental part of an Inter-Integrated Sound (I2S) device, responsible for managing the generation of I2S audio interface clocks. The two input ports for the module are 'ck', which is the clock signal controlling the timing and synchronization, and 'rst', which is the reset signal for initializing the module. The outputs produced by the module include 'en', a clock enable signal; 'sck', the I2S serial clock signal; \u2018ws\u2019, a word select clock signal determining the active frame of data; and 'frame_posn', a 6-bit output indicating the exact position within 64 states of the frame. The internal register \u2018prescale\u2019 operates as a counter regulated by the value of the parameter DIVIDER, dictating the operation of 'en', 'sck', and 'frame_posn'. The initial block sets the initial conditions for the output ports. The always block operates whenever there's a positive edge at the clock signal, resetting the internal prescale register and outputs when there's a reset signal. If the prescale value is equal to (DIVIDER-1), the prescale restarts at 0, and frame_posn increments with 'en' enabled. Otherwise, prescale increments with 'en' disabled. Finally, the conditions for 'sck' and 'ws' are updated at every clock signal's positive edge. That enables the module to function as a clock generator for I2S interfaces, appropriately managing timing and data transmission.",
