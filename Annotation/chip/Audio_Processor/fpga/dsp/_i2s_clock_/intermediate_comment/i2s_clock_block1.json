    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code implements an I2S (Inter-IC Sound) protocol controller. It is triggered by a positive edge clock signal (ck). If the reset signal (rst) is high, it initializes the prescaler, frame position, enable, word select (ws), and serial clock (sck) signals to zero. Following a reset, the if-else structure divides the clock signal frequency by a factor of DIVIDER and increments frame position with each cycle, toggling the enable signal. The resultant prescaler value controls the sck signal while the frame position dictates the word select (ws) signal state. The enable signal (en) is set to 1 when prescale equals DIVIDER-1 and reset to 0 otherwise."
