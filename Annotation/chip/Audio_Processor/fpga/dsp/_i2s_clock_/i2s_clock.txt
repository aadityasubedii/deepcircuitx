Module-level comment: The i2s_clock module generates I2S audio interface clocks, with input ports for clock ('ck') and reset ('rst') signals, and output signals including a clock enable ('en'), a serial clock ('sck'), a word select clock ('ws'), and a 6-bit frame position ('frame_posn'). Internally, it uses a 'prescale' register as a counter to manage the states of the output signals. On each clock cycle, if reset is high, it initializes all signals and 'prescale', otherwise the 'prescale' increments, influencing the states of 'en', 'sck', and 'frame_posn', thus driving the timely generation and synchronization of the I2S audio interface clocks.
