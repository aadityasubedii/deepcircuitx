    "block_comment": "This code block instantiates a 16-bit registered variable termed 'p_in'. This 'p_in' variable is initialised with a value of zero. The square brackets '[]' determine the range of the register (16 bits here), with 15 as the most significant bit (MSB) and 0 as the least significant bit (LSB). The value it contains can be modified during the simulation run, and stores the value between successive simulation time periods due to its nature as a 'reg'."
