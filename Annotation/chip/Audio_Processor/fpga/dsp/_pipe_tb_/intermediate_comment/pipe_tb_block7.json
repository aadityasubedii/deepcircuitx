    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a clock signal. It is implemented using an 'always' block in Verilog, which executes continuously in a loop. The delay of '#42' indicates the time period of the clock cycle. After every 42 time units, the clock signal (ck) is inverted, generating a continuous clock signal."
