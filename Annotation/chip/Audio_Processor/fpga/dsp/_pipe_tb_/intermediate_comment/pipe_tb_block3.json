    "block_comment": "The block initializes a parallel array of 16 pipeline stages each of length 3 bits. This is achieved using a parameterized design of the `pipe` module - the parameter `LENGTH` set to 3 defines the bit-width of each pipeline stage. The input to these stages is controlled by `p_in`, the output is monitored by `p_out`, and their operation is synchronized by the clock signal `ck`."
