This testbench accomplishes this through the use of 'pipe' instances. The data being tested is loaded into 'in' variables and the results are stored in 'out' variables. Various test conditions are then applied under different states of clock changes ('posedge ck'). The assertions (tb_assert) are used to verify the correctness of the data output, according to the sequence of inputs."
