    "block_comment": "This block initiates the testbench environment for the module 'tb'. It creates a Value Change Dump (VCD) file named 'dsp.vcd' to record the simulation results, uses '$dumpvars' function to display all the variables of the top module 'tb', and finally, terminates the simulation run after a delay of 500000 time units using '$finish'. The operations are scheduled in an 'initial' block, thereby signifying their one-time execution at the beginning of the simulation."
