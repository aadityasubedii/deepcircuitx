    "spec": "Module name: tb. \n\nModule specification: The 'tb' module is a Verilog testbench module designed for the purpose of simulating and testing the operation of a 'pipe' instance of varying lengths that functions as a pipeline data structure. The testing of this pipeline happens under different states of the system clock changes ('posedge ck'), where the input test data is loaded into the 'in' variables and the testing results are stored in the 'out' variables. \n\nThe module does not have traditional input and output ports like design modules due to its purpose as a self-contained testbench, but interacts with instantiated elements (pipe instances and a reset instance) using internal signals that can be considered similar to input and output ports. These include 'ck' for the system clock; input test data 'pt_in', 'p_in', and 'p1_in' for the pipe, multipe-pipe and single-length pipe instances respectively; 'rst' serving as the reset signal, and output data 'pt_out', 'p_out', and 'p1_out' from the pipe, multiple-pipe and single-length pipe instances.\n\nInternal signals 'ck', 'rst', 'pt_in', 'pt_out', 'pt_i', 'p_in', 'p_out', 'p1_in', 'p1_out' govern the operation, transitioning state and storing output data during the testing phase. \n\nThe code comprises of different blocks with varied functions such as a dumpfile and dumpvars block for generating a waveform output, segments that define and initialise the clock signal 'ck', a reset instance providing reset signal 'rst', multiple testing blocks for pipe, multiple-pipe and single-length pipe that represent distinct tests following different sequences of operation held together by assertions to check the correctness of the output values. Thus, the module delivers a comprehensive testbench for verification and validation of functionality of pipe instances of varying lengths.",

The testing of this pipeline happens under different states of the system clock changes ('posedge ck'), where the input test data is loaded into the 'in' variables and the testing results are stored in the 'out' variables. \n\nThe module does not have traditional input and output ports like design modules due to its purpose as a self-contained testbench, but interacts with instantiated elements (pipe instances and a reset instance) using internal signals that can be considered similar to input and output ports. These include 'ck' for the system clock; input test data 'pt_in', 'p_in', and 'p1_in' for the pipe, multipe-pipe and single-length pipe instances respectively; 'rst' serving as the reset signal, and output data 'pt_out', 'p_out', and 'p1_out' from the pipe, multiple-pipe and single-length pipe instances.\n\nInternal signals 'ck', 'rst', 'pt_in', 'pt_out', 'pt_i', 'p_in', 'p_out', 'p1_in', 'p1_out' govern the operation, transitioning state and storing output data during the testing phase. \n\nThe code comprises of different blocks with varied functions such as a dumpfile and dumpvars block for generating a waveform output, segments that define and initialise the clock signal 'ck', a reset instance providing reset signal 'rst', multiple testing blocks for pipe, multiple-pipe and single-length pipe that represent distinct tests following different sequences of operation held together by assertions to check the correctness of the output values. Thus, the module delivers a comprehensive testbench for verification and validation of functionality of pipe instances of varying lengths."
