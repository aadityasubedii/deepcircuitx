    "block_comment": "This block of code declares a 16-bit wire named p_out. It serves as an interconnection point for transmitting binary information between hardware components. Specifically, it defines a wire-type signal using a 16-bit width, which allows for 65536 different combinations of values (2^16). This broad range means that p_out can function as a substantial data link, carrying multiple pieces of information between different Verilog modules or within a complex module."
