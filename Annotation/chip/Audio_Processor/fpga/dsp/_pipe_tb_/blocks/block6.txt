This block tests the functionality of a pipe component. It begins by asserting that the output of the pipe (pt_out) is initially 0 and introduces input (pt_in) to the pipe at the positive edge of the clock (ck). Then it performs two cycles of 4 clock ticks where it first asserts that the pipe output remains 0 and then expects the output to be 1. Lastly, the block toggles the pipe input between 1 and 0 with each clock tick, asserting desired values (1 or 0) as per each clock phase, which mimics the expected behavior of a pipelined computation.
