Comment: 
This block of code essentially performs input-output checks after every clock cycle in a verification testing procedure. It is initialized upon rising edge of the clock, explicitly waiting for reset signal to go low. Following this, a sequence of test vectors are fed to `p_in` input at rising clock edges and corresponding assertions are made on expected state of `p_out` after every clock cycle to ensure desired delay functionality. The test vectors are deliberately varied to cover a diverse set of inputs.
