Module name: tb.

Module specification: The 'tb' module is a testbench in Verilog used for simulating and testing the functionality of an integrated component, primarily a peripheral module for SK9822 LED control. This module generates a clock signal (`ck`), initiates a reset signal with specified length (`rst`), initializes the write bus with signals like `wb_dbus_cyc`, `wb_dbus_we`, `wb_dbus_adr`, and `wb_dbus_dat`, and communicates with the peripheral device, sending address and data via the write bus. The process is monitored via an acknowledgement signal (`ack`). All these events and data exchange are synced with a clock signal (`wb_clk`).

Though it doesn't have explicit input or output ports as it is a self-contained piece of code, the module 'tb' uses several internal signals. These include a clock signal (`ck`), a reset signal (`rst`), a write bus clock signal (`wb_clk`), and reset signal (`wb_rst`). It also uses signals to indicate a valid wishbone cycle (`wb_dbus_cyc`), to distinguish between read and write operations (`wb_dbus_we`), to provide address input (`wb_dbus_adr`), and data input (`wb_dbus_dat`) for the wishbone bus. An acknowledgement signal from the component (`ack`) is also used. Further, LED-specific signals (`led_ck`, `led_data`), a loop counter (`i`), and a base address for write operations (`ADDR`) are also employed.

The Verilog code is organized into various blocks. There is a clock generator block, a reset module instantiation, a block for signal assignments, a task for write operations, and a block for waiting for acknowledgement from the peripheral module after each write operation. These blocks together accomplish the task of testing the peripheral module for SK9822 LED control via write operations, and finally generate a VCD file for post-simulation verification.
