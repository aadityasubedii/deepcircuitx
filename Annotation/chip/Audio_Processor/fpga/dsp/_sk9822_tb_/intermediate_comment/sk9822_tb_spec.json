    "spec": "Module name: tb.\n\nModule specification: The 'tb' module is a testbench in Verilog used for simulating and testing the functionality of an integrated component, primarily a peripheral module for SK9822 LED control. This module generates a clock signal (`ck`), initiates a reset signal with specified length (`rst`), initializes the write bus with signals like `wb_dbus_cyc`, `wb_dbus_we`, `wb_dbus_adr`, and `wb_dbus_dat`, and communicates with the peripheral device, sending address and data via the write bus. The process is monitored via an acknowledgement signal (`ack`). All these events and data exchange are synced with a clock signal (`wb_clk`).\n\nThough it doesn't have explicit input or output ports as it is a self-contained piece of code, the module 'tb' uses several internal signals. These include a clock signal (`ck`), a reset signal (`rst`), a write bus clock signal (`wb_clk`), and reset signal (`wb_rst`). It also uses signals to indicate a valid wishbone cycle (`wb_dbus_cyc`), to distinguish between read and write operations (`wb_dbus_we`), to provide address input (`wb_dbus_adr`), and data input (`wb_dbus_dat`) for the wishbone bus. An acknowledgement signal from the component (`ack`) is also used. Further, LED-specific signals (`led_ck`, `led_data`), a loop counter (`i`), and a base address for write operations (`ADDR`) are also employed.\n\nThe Verilog code is organized into various blocks. There is a clock generator block, a reset module instantiation, a block for signal assignments, a task for write operations, and a block for waiting for acknowledgement from the peripheral module after each write operation. These blocks together accomplish the task of testing the peripheral module for SK9822 LED control via write operations, and finally generate a VCD file for post-simulation verification.",

Essential for synchronization of data.\n- wb_rst: The write bus reset input. Used to reset the component to a known state.\n- wb_dbus_cyc: This signal indicates a valid wishbone cycle.\n- wb_dbus_we: This signal distinguishes between read and write operations.\n- wb_dbus_adr: This is the address input to the wishbone bus for data interaction.\n- wb_dbus_dat: This is the data input to the wishbone bus for write operation.\n\nOutput ports: ack, led_ck, led_data.\nExplanation:\n- ack: This is an output signal from the component to acknowledge the completion of a write operation.\n- led_ck: This is an output clock signal for LED control.\n- led_data: This is the output data for LED control."

It is set to 1 when a write operation is happening and reset to 0 when write is done and acknowledgement signal is received.\n\n    - wb_dbus_adr: This signal holds the address value for a write operation on the wishbone bus. It is loaded with corresponding address value during a write and reset when the write is done and acknowledgement signal is received.\n\n    - wb_dbus_dat: This signal holds the data to be written during a write operation on the wishbone bus. Similar to the wb_dbus_adr, it is also loaded with corresponding data during a write and reset when the write is done and acknowledgement signal is received.\n\n    - ack: This signal is an output from the peripheral device.
