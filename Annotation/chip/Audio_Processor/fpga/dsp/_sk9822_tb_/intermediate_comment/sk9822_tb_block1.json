    "block_comment": "This block initializes and performs a sequence of write operations on a memory device. After waiting for the deassertion of a reset signal and five clock cycles, it enters a loop running 16 times, in which it writes adjusted indices to incrementing addresses, then waits for an acknowledge signal and its negation before advancing the next clock edge. By writing unique values to successive memory locations and synchronizing operations with the system clock and acknowledge signals, it verifies memory writing process and its latency."
