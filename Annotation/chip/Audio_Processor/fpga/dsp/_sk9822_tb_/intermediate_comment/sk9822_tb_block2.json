    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to halt the wishbone bus cycle when an acknowledgement signal, `ack`, is received. Leveraging the rising edge of the wishbone clock (signified by `posedge wb_clk`), the block zeroes `wb_dbus_cyc` and `wb_dbus_we` to end the cycle and write-enable operation, respectively. Furthermore, it also designates invalid (or high impedance) outputs to `wb_dbus_adr` and `wb_dbus_dat` by assigning them with `32'hZ`, effectively disabling the address and data buses."
