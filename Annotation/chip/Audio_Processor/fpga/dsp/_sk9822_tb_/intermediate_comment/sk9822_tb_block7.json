    "block_comment": "This block initiates the waveform dump for debugging purposes. It specifies \"dsp.vcd\" as the output file for the waveform dump, which contains the changes in values of all variables throughout the simulated execution of the 'tb' testbench. After a delay of 500000 time units, it ends the simulation."
