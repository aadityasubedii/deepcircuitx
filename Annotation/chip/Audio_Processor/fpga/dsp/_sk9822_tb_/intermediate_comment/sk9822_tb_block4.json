    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for the wire assignment operation. It effectively assigns the value of the 'rst' signal to the 'wb_rst' wire. The operation is achieved through the use of the 'assign' keyword which sets the 'wb_rst' wire on the left side to have the value of the 'rst' signal on the right side. This operation is typically used in hardware descriptions for setting up or resetting state conditions."
