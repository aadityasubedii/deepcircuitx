The block performs a write operation in memory. It achieves the function by activating the write bus cycle with 'wb_dbus_cyc', defining the address 'wb_dbus_adr' and data 'wb_dbus_dat' to be written, and signaling the write-enable 'wb_dbus_we'. The write process will start when 'wb_dbus_we' is set to 1.
