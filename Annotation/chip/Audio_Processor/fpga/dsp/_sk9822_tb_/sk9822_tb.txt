Module-level comment: This is the 'tb' testbench module for simulating and testing an integrated software component, primarily a peripheral module for SK9822 LED control. It achieves this by generating a clock signal, initiating a reset signal, and initializing the write bus for communication with the peripheral device. The module conducts write tasks looped for different memory addresses, synchronized with the clock signal. Functionality testing is accomplished by monitoring the completion of write operations through an acknowledgement signal. The module concludes the simulation after a specified time and generates a VCD file for post-simulation verification.
