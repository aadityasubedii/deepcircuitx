Comment: 
This block of code manages frame positioning within a data stream. It operates synchronously with the rising edge of an identified clock `ck`. The `start_sck` signal conditionally enables the block, and when asserted, `frame_posn` is incremented by one, allowing for tracking of the position within a frame. Conversely, when `start_frame` is asserted, `frame_posn` is reset to 0, denoting the beginning of a new frame.
