Comment: 
This block generates the signal for the start of frame (SOF) in a local bus protocol. This is achieved by performing a bitwise AND operation between the enable signal (`local_en`) and a condition that checks if the frame position (`local_frame_posn`) is at the start point (`0`). The result is assigned to the `local_sof` variable, indicating the start of a new frame when it is true.
