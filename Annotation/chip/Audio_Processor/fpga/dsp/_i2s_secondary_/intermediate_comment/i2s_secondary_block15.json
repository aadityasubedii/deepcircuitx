    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for setting the initial condition of the `en` signal to low or '0'. In Verilog Hardware Description Language, `initial` blocks are used to define initial conditions or values for signals or variables at the time of simulation start. Here, the `en` signal is initially set to '0', demonstrating that this signal is inactive or disabled at the beginning of the simulation or operation."
