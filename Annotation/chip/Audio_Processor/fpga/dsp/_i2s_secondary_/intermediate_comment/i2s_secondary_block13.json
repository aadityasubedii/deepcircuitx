    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating (recording) the previous states of both 'ws0' and 'sck0' signals at every rising edge of the clock signal 'ck'. Implementation wise, it uses a 'posedge' clocked always block, which indicates that at every positive edge of the 'ck' signal, the current states of 'ws0' and 'sck0' are captured and stored into 'prev_ws' and 'prev_sck' respectively, until the next clock edge comes."
