    "block_comment": "This always block serves the function of edge-triggered state caching for the sck and ws signals. The block is activated at the rising edge of the clock signal (ck), which is when it stores the current state of sck into sck0 and ws into ws0, effectively creating one clock cycle delays for these signals. This implementation enables synchronization of these signals with primary elements elsewhere in the design."
