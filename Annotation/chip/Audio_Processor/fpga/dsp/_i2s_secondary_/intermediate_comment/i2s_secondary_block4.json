    "block_comment": "This block orchestrates frame processing and error tracking in serial communication. Triggered by a positive edge clock signal, it updates the working state with an external signal and tracks the position of a 64-bit data frame. It resets frame count if transmission is error-free; else, upon encountering the start of a frame, it increments the count unless it's already at maximum. The block also maintains a tally of good frames - it increments the count at the start of a frame if this is the first frame otherwise it resets the count. Thus, managing frame sequence and error recovery."
