    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a module `i2s_detect` which is designed for handling I2S (Inter-IC Sound) protocol detection. The module takes in a set of inputs including a clock signal `ck`, an external word select `ext_ws`, an external frame position `ext_frame_posn`, a local enable signal `local_en`, and a local frame position `local_frame_posn`, and outputs a `valid` signal. The `WIDTH` parameter is tailored to represent the size of the data word. Depending on the activity and alignment of these input signals, the module helps detect and validate the I2S audio data frames."
