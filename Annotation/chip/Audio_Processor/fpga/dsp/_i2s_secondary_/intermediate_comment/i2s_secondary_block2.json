    "block_comment": "The \"i2s_dual\" module is a part of an I2S audio interface, handling audio data reception and transmission, supporting both internal and external clock sources. It encapsulates other modules: \"i2s_clock\", \"i2s_secondary\", and \"i2s_detect\". \"i2s_clock\" serves as the local clock and controls the frame position, helping the block manage both channels' data for input and output. \"i2s_secondary\" synchronizes the frame position with an external clock source when available. \"i2s_detect\" uses both local and external frame positions to track and validate incoming data. According to the \"external\" flag, the module dynamically switches between internal and external clocking, assigning appropriate clock, data enable signals, word select lines, and frame positions."
