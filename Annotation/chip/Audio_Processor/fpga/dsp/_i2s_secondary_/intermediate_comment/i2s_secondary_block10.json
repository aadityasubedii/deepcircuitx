    "block_comment": "This block of code controls a prescaler and a match register in synchronous logic design. On the positive edge of a clock (ck), if a clock input (ck_in) is high, the prescaler is reset to zero and the match register is set to the result of the current prescale value subtracting three. In case the clock input (ck_in) is low and the prescale has not reached its maximum value (S_MAX), the prescaler increments its value with every clock cycle."
