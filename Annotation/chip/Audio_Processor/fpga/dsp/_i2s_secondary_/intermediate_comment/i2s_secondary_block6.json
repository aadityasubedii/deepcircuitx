    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for defining and assigning values to \"sof\" and \"ext_okay\". Initially, \"sof\" is assigned a boolean value based on the value of \"ws_0\" and \"!ws\". It is set to true if \"ws_0\" is true and \"ws\" is false, otherwise, it's set to false. This is typically used to detect a transition in a signal. Similarly, \"ext_okay\" is assigned a value based on \"had_64_bits\" and \"sof\". If both \"had_64_bits\" and \"sof\" are true, \"ext_okay\" is also true, indicating a condition where it's okay to extend certain functionality. This block helps with controlling the flow and operation in a larger digital design system, managing signal transitions and extension permissions."
