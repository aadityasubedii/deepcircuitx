    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes the `frame_posn` with a value of 0. The `frame_posn` is essentially a variable that is assigned a base value before any operation is performed on it. In the context of Verilog hardware description language, the `initial` keyword is used to specify a value that a variable or a register assumes when a simulation starts or when the system is reset. This block with `initial` statement is prominently used in testbenches or verification related verilog codes."
