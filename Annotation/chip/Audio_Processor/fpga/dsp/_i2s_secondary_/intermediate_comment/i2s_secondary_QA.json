Module name: i2s_secondary.\nExplanation: This module is designed to manage frame positions and enable state for some I2S (Inter-IC Sound) related process. It constantly monitors and updates its working based on changes in input clocks (ck, sck) and word select (ws).\n\n2. Module name: i2s_detect.\nExplanation: As per the given verilog code, this module could be used to detect the valid frames in an I2S data stream based on certain conditions such as if 64 bits have been received, if the local frame position reaches the start (0), and if conditions under positive edge of the clock meet the required logic. It then outputs a 'valid' signal indicating the completion of this process. \n\n3. Module name: i2s_dual.\nExplanation: This module appears to implement an I2S system that can operate based on two sources of clock - external and local. Depending on the 'external' signal, it chooses whether to follow the external clock or the local clock. It also selects the word select(ws), enable(en), and frame position accordingly. \n\nNonetheless, having only this piece of code and without having information about some submodules (like i2s_clock) that appear in the code, this explanation might not fully capture all the nuances. It would enhance understanding if the associated hardware context or specifications were provided."
