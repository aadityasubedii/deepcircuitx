    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, i2s_dual, is a versatile Inter-IC Sound (I2S) implementation that works with both external and local clock and word select signals. It utilizes three embedded sub-modules: i2s_clock (generates local I2S signals), i2s_secondary (manages frame positions and enable state for external I2S signals), and i2s_detect (identifies valid I2S frames). Based on the 'valid' output of i2s_detect, it selects between local and external I2S sources. It facilitates dynamic audio routing/switching in a digital audio system."
