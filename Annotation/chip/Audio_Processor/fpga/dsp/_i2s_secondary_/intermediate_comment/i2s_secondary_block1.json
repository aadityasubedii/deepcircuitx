    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for multiplexing between local and external versions of several signals based on the condition of the \"external\" signal. If \"external\" is true, the values for signals 'sck', 'ws', 'en', and 'frame_posn' are assigned to their external counterparts ('ext_sck', 'ext_ws', 'ext_en', 'ext_frame_posn'). Otherwise, these signals take their local counterparts' values ('local_sck', 'local_ws', 'local_en', 'local_frame_posn'). It's a straightforward implementation of conditional signal assignment based on boolean multiplexing."
