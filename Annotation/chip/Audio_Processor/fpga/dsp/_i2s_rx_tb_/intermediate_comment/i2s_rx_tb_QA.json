The implemented tasks are designed to send specific data to the I2S receiver and it verifies if the expected data is being correctly received or not. The code uses several task commands, typically used in SystemVerilog for creating reusable test cases, which indicates that this could be a test bench module for a digital audio device or interface. Checking assertion through tb_assert instruction ensures that the received output matches the sent input. Along with that, I2S transmitter testing is done where specific left and right data values are sent and the output data 'tx' and 'tx_32' are asserted according to the bit calculations of the sent data."
