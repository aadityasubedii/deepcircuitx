    "block_comment": "This logic block manages a 32-bit transmission shift register. Upon a positive edge of the clock (ck), it checks for a reset condition (rst). If reset is asserted, it clears the 32-bit shift register, otherwise, it checks the frame enable flag (frame_en). If frame_en is also high, it effectively performs a right shift operation on the 32-bit register, pushing a zero into the most-significant bit."
