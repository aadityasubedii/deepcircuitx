    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a clock signal with a period of 84 units of simulation time. This is implemented by an always block that toggles (flips) the state of the `ck` signal every 42 units of simulation time. The exclamation mark '!' in Verilog stands for logical NOT, therefore `!ck` inverses the value of `ck`. By continuously inverting `ck`, this results in a clock signal."
