    "block_comment": "This Verilog task block waits for a specific signal change. It waits for a positive edge on the clock, then it waits for the input signal to become true. Once the signal is true, it again waits for a positive edge on the clock and then waits for the input signal to become false. After the signal is false, it again waits for a positive edge on the clock. Hence, this block essentially waits for the input signal to complete a full cycle of going from 0 to 1, and back to 0 with respect to rising clock edges before completing the task."
