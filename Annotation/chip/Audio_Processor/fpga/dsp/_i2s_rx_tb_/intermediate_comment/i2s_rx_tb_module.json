    "module": "Module-level comment: This 'tb' module is a Verilog test bench for testing an Inter-IC Sound (I2S) protocol with various data sizes and clock rates. The module creates instances of i2s_rx and i2s_tx for receiving and transmitting the data respectively. Key internal signals include clock (ck), reset (rst), sample, frame_posn, and data streams (left/right etc.), and shift registers (tx_shift, tx_shift_32). Module generates and sends 16-bit and 24-bit data via tasks, and the received audio data stream is verified using assertions. The goal is to test and ensure the correct functionality of the I2S communication protocol under different conditions."
