    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code involves an assignment operation for a single bit of signal done in a non-blocking manner. The function of this block is to assign the value of the 32nd bit from the tx_shift_32 array to the bit signal 'sd_32'. The block achieves its function by using the Verilog 'assign' keyword, which is used for continuous assignment statements. This syntax means that whenever a change of value occurs at the bit position 31 in 'tx_shift_32', 'sd_32' will also be updated concurrently with this new value."
