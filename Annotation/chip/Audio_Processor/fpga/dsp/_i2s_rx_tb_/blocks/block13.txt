This block of code is defining signal assignments for frame_en, tx_en, and sample, based on the value of variable prescale. If the value of prescale equals 6, frame_en is activated. If the value equals 8, tx_en is activated and if the value equals 12, sample is activated. These comparisons are made concurrently in hardware.
