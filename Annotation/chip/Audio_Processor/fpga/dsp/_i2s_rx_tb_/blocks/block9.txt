Comment: 
This block executes a series of I2S (Inter-IC Sound) receiver tests. The block initiates with an assertion for reset and a wait for a positive clock edge. For 4 scenarios, it sends specific 24-bit left and right audio sample sets, waits for a specific frame position, and then asserts to check if audio samples are correctly assigned. After completing all scenarios, it displays 'done' and ends.
