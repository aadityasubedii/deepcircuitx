Comment: 
The block of code defines a task that transmits 32-bit signals composed of two 16-bit inputs. The task, send_32, combines two 16-bit inputs, 'l' and 'r', into a single 32-bit signal to be sent. The transmission sequence is defined by two wait statements: the first transmission occurs when the 'frame_posn' is equal to 1 and 'tx_en' is triggered; the completion of the sequence is signaled when 'frame_posn' equals 2.
