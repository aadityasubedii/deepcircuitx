This block of code is for testing an I2S 32-bit receiver. The test includes sending 32-bit values, waiting for a certain frame, and then asserting that the received value is the same as the sent value. The testing process is repeated with different sets of values. This is achieved by using the send_32 function to send data, the wait and @ statements for syncing with the clock and the frame count, and tb_assert to validate the received data.
