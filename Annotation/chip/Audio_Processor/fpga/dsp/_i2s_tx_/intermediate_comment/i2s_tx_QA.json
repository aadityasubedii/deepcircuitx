The I2S is a standard in digital sound processing used for conveying audio data within devices. In this particular module, audio data for left and right channels are received, then based on system clock edge and enable flag, data is processed and transmitted. Audio data is processed based on the frame position specified. It has an option to work in two modes based on the CLOCKS parameter, either 32 or 64 clock cycles per frame. It has a left/right data choosing mechanism based on the frame position and whether the frame's midpoint has been reached. Consequently, shift register is loaded with appropriate channel data. As the clock pulses, the module shifts the leftmost bit of the shift register to the output ('sd') and shifts the remaining data left until the end of each frame, then it repeats the process."

At the start of each frame (either left or right), the corresponding 16-bit audio data is loaded into this register. The audio data is then transmitted bit by bit (from MSB to LSB) in each clock cycle when the 'en' signal is high. Each time a bit is transmitted, the remaining data in the register is shifted left to prepare for the next transmission.\n- MASK: This is a 6-bit value that is used to mask the values of 'frame_position'. Different MASK values are set depending on whether CLOCKS parameter is 32 or 64, for proper frame position tracking.\n- midpoint: This signal specifies the midpoint of the frame motion (either 32 or 16 depending on CLOCKS). This is used to switch from left to right audio channel data. \n- frame: This signal is the result of bitwise AND operation between 'frame_posn' and 'MASK'.
