Module Name: i2s_tx

Module Specification: 

The module 'i2s_tx' serves to perform Inter-IC Sound (I2S) transmission, a digital sound processing used for conveying audio data within devices. For the audio data of left and right channels received, it processes and transmits data based on the system clock edge and an enable flag. It operates in either 32 or 64 clock cycles per frame mode as determined by the CLOCKS parameter. Within this module, 'ck' is the clock signal, and 'en' is the enable signal, upon which high state data shifting operation is contingent. It also utilizes a frame_posn input to monitor the position in the frame, dictating where to process left or right channel data. The audio data for left and right channels received are input through 'left' and 'right' respectively. The output 'sd' represents the data ready to be transmitted.

Internally, the module employs the 'shift' register for storing the 16-bit audio data received from the input channel. This register data is then sent to output bit by bit sequentially on each clock tick when 'en' is high. It uses a 6-bit 'MASK' value to set the values of 'frame_position' depending on the CLOCKS parameter, effectively tracking frame position. The 'midpoint' signal indicates the middle of the frame motion and is instrumental when we need to switch from left to right audio channel, derived from CLOCKS. The 'frame' signal, an outcome of the bitwise AND operation between 'frame_posn' and 'MASK', reflects the current effective frame position for proper channel switching and shifting audio data.

In terms of its structure, the code includes parameters, inputs, and outputs definition, internal variables. Key blocks within the code correspond to the CLOCKS parameters setting, current frame calculation, and data manipulation & transmission upon a clock's rising edge. Notably, one block executes the MASK and midpoint assignment based on the CLOCKS parameter, another block calculates the current frame position by conducting an AND operation on 'frame_posn' and 'MASK', and the last block monitors the enable signal and clock's rising edge to carry out right to left shift in data, channel switching and aligns data to be transmitted.
