Module-level comment: 

The 'i2s_tx' module performs Inter-IC Sound transmission within devices using left and right audio data. It processes and transmits data per the system clock edge and enable flag, with two operating modes being 32 or 64 clock cycles/frame. Internally, it uses a 'shift' register to manipulate, store and send out the 16-bit audio data bit by bit, employing 'MASK' and 'midpoint' values derived from CLOCKS for frame position tracking and channel switching. The output is prepared based on the frame position, channel, and enable signal, giving a processed single bit output to 'sd'.
