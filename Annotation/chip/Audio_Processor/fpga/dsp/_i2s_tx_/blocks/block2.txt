Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for assigning the value of a frame signal based on frame's position and a specific mask. The operation being performed here is a bitwise AND operation between 'frame_posn' and the constant 'MASK', resulting in a value for 'frame' that only has bits set where both 'frame_posn' and 'MASK' have bits set.
