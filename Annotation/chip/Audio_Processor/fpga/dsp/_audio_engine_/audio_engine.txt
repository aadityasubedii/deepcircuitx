Module-level comment: The audio_engine module handles reading and writing of audio data in hardware designs. It operates through inputs for control, address, and data signals and outputs for acknowledgment, data read, I2S, and debugging purposes. Implementation involves the use of sequential logic, I2S handling procedures, internal signal mechanisms, direct memory accesses, and specially identified control phases for dynamic operation, especially suited for stereo sound processing and system synchronization. Major functional blocks include reset control, I2S receiver/transmitter, data saving process, and sequencer management.
