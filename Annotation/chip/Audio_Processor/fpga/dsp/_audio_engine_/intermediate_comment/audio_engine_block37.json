    "block_comment": "This Verilog block implements a data writing mechanism based on the state of two main control signals: 'writing' and 'frame_reset_req'. It homes in on a specified address 'write_addr' and writes data 'write_data' from an audio source when 'writing' is active. The 'write_addr' is derived from a combination of 'chan_addr' and 'frame_counter' while 'write_data' captures data from the 'mic_source' only when 'writing' is activated, otherwise, it writes '0'. The centred 'write_en' ensures data is written to the address only during active 'writing' stages."
