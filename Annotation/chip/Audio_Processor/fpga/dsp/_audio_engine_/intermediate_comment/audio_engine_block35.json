    "block_comment": "This block of code declares seven wire vectors, each intended to represent a microphone input signal. The wires are named mic_0 to mic_6. Each of these wire vectors have a size determined by the value of the constant `MIC_W`, defined elsewhere, allowing these wires to handle binary data with a width equal to `MIC_W`."
