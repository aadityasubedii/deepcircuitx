    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for setting up parameter addresses for a series of local parameters \u2013 `ADDR_COEF`, `ADDR_RESULT`, `ADDR_STATUS`, `ADDR_INPUT`, and `ADDR_DMA`. It does so by taking a base address (`ADDR`), which is a constant parameter, and adding specified values to it for each subsequent address. Addition here is performed in hexadecimal format."
