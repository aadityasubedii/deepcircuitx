    "block_comment": "This block of code instantiates an I2S (Inter-IC Sound) transmitter module named `tx_1` that is used to output audio data. The module takes as inputs the clock signal (`ck`), an enable signal (`i2s_out_sample`), a frame position signal (`frame_posn`), as well as the left channel audio data (`left_1`) and the right channel audio data (`right_1`). The output of the module is the serial data (`sd_out1`) that contains the audio sample data to be transmitted. The module depends on the `CLOCK` parameter (`I2S_BITS`) to determine the timing of the I2S protocol."
