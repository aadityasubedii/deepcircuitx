    "block_comment": "This section of Verilog code deals with signal assignment for controlling and testing parameters. It consolidates acknowledgments (acks) from various parts, such as result, status, DMA (Direct Memory Access) bus, coefficient, and input, into a single 'ack' signal. Similarly, 'rdt' signal is formulated based on the status of read-time delays in result, status, and DMA bus. A 'ready' signal is also assigned which indicates the completion of an operation. The block also assigns testing signals 'test' for various cases including system clock (sck), write-select (ws), input data (sd_in0, sd_in1), external system clock (ext_sck), and external write-select (ext_ws)."
