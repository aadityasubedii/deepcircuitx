    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns zero values to three signals, namely `dma_dbus_rdt`, `dma_dbus_ack`, and `dma_done`. The `assign` keyword in Verilog enables continuous assignment statements, therefore these lines continuously force their RHS values (zero in this case) to their LHS signal variables. These signals might be used in other parts of the code to indicate a response to a direct memory access (DMA) operation, such as acknowledging a DMA operation and signifying its completion status."
