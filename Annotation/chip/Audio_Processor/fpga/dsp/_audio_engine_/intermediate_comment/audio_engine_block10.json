    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code regulates the functioning and status of a configurable audio processing module according to the written status information. On every positive edge of the clock, it examines the 'status_we' and 'status_addr' signals to initialise or modify operational parameters such as allowing audio writes, control register data, input/output offsets and handling bank switching. There are also functionalities for handling reset requests that include toggling reset signals and bank address, and an incorporated mechanism to confirm completion of reset operation."
