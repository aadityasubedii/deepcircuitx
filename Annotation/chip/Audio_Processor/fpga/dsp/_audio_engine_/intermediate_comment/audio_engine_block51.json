    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for enabling a conditional action based on the comparison of two variables. This is implemented using the \"assign\" keyword in Verilog, which is used for continuous assignment statements. In this particular instance, the enable signal 'en' is assigned a boolean value that is determined through the comparison of 'offset' and 'counter'. If both 'offset' and 'counter' are equal, 'en' would be set to true, signaling that the conditions of the logic statement have been met."
