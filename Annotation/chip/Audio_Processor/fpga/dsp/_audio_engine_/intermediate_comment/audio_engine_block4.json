    "block_comment": "This block represents a direct memory access (DMA) module. The DMA performs data transfers between memory and peripheral devices. It works by accepting the read/write requests from the processor, seizing control of the bus, decoding the address and performing the required operation. This is evident from several input and output signals; `wb_dbus_cyc` and `wb_dbus_we` represent the wishbone bus cycles and write enable signal, which are crucial in write operations. Similarly, `wb_dbus_adr` and  `wb_dbus_dat` designate the address and data to be written respectively. `dbus_rdt` and `dbus_ack` signify read data and acknowledgment from the module. Besides, `xfer_adr`, `xfer_re` and `xfer_dat` are responsible for transferring the data. The operation completion is indicated by `xfer_done` signal. Furthermore, the DMA request is indicated by `dma_cyc`, `dma_we` designates write enable signal for DMA, and `dma_adr` & `dma_dat` are for DMA address and data respectively. The `dma_ack` & `dma_rdt` signals show the acknowledgment and read data from the DMA."
