    "block_comment": "This block of code implements the chip select for the status register of a wishbone bus system. It uses an instance of the module 'chip_select', where 'ADDR_STATUS' is passed as the address parameter during module instantiation. The signals 'ck', 'cs_adr', 'wb_dbus_cyc', and 'wb_rst' are used as inputs, representing the clock, address, wishbone cycle, and reset operations, respectively. The 'status_ack' and 'status_cyc' are output signals, which get activated when the block operation is successful."
