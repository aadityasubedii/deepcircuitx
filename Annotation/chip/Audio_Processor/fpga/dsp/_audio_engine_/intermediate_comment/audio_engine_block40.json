    "block_comment": "This block of code is defining a local parameter I2S_DIVIDER for a HiFi audio interface in the context of a larger Verilog RTL system. This is done when the Make HiFi flag (MAKE_HIFI) is set. The I2S_DIVIDER parameter, represented as a 6-bit binary number, is being assigned a value of 20. The purpose of this parameter is commonly to control the divider ratio of an I2S clock in a digital audio system."
