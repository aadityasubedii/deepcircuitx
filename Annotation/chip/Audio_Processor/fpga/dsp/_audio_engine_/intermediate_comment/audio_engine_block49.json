    "block_comment": "This line of code sets a constant parameter named `CK_HZ` to the value of `32000000` in the Verilog HDL. It essentially defines the frequency of the system clock in Hz for the rest of the system. This frequency is set as a parameter, suggesting that it will remain unchanged throughout the program and it allows to maintain and change the frequency uniformly across all the modules of a hardware design if necessary."
