    "block_comment": "The function of the block is to implement a Dual Port Random Access Memory (DPRAM) with a data width of 32 bits and size equal to double the value of `CODE`. The DPRAM module receives clock signal from `ck`, has write enable (`we`) and read enable (`re`) signals from `coef_we` and constant `1'h1` respectively. The write address and data are received from `coef_waddr` and `wb_dbus_dat` correspondingly, whereas the read address is from `coef_raddr`. The output of read data is `coef_rdata`."
