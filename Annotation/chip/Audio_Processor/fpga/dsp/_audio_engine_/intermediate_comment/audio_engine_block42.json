    "block_comment": "This block of code implements audio write permission and frame control in a digital system. It employs a conditional selection (ternary operator) to decide the frame's value. Specifically, if 'allow_audio_writes' is active, 'control_reg_frame' defines the frame. Else, 'frame_counter' drives the frame. It leverages 'reg' data types for storing intermediate outcomes."
