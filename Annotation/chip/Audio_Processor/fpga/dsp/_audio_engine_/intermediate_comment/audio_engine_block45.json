    "block_comment": "This block manages reset signaling synchronization with the clock domain. Upon encountering a positive edge clock signal ('ck'), it checks if a reset request ('reset_req') or frame reset request ('frame_reset_req') is active. When either condition is met, it forces the variable 'resetx' to zero. In case these conditions aren't met and 'resetx' isn't equal to 2'b10, it increments 'resetx' by 1 at every clock cycle, providing a count-up functionality."
