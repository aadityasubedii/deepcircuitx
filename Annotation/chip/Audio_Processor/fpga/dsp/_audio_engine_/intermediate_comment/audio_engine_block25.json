    "block_comment": "This block of code manages memory addressing and control signals in a digital audio processing system. The operation begins at every rising edge of the clock. If `allow_audio_writes` is asserted low, it checks if it's the start of a new audio frame by using `start_of_frame` signal. At the start of a new frame, it resets the `chan_addr` to zero which is presumably the audio channel address, and sets `writing` and decreases `frame_counter`. If it's not the start of the frame, it increments the `chan_addr`. When `writing` goes high and `chan_addr` equals `CHANNELS-1`, it means all channels have been accessed, and thus, `writing` is set low, and `frame_reset_req` is set high to request a reset for the next frame. The `frame_reset_req` is automatically reset in the next clock cycle if it's still high. This ensures that the `frame_reset_req` will be high for only one clock cycle at the end of a frame."
