This can include actions such as handling the bit width of different audio channels, the sizing of frames and channels, and reading in and out data from different bus connections. The audio is connected to an I2S audio protocol, and the module also contains functionalities for sequencer and DMA operations. The module defines audio data processing rules and operations, making it vital to any system that requires audio signal processing and transfer. The module handles the complex task of organizing and implementing audio data operations with various parameters such as offset, external inputs, and other data configurations."
