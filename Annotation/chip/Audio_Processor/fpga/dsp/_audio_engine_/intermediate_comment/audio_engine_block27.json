    "block_comment": "This function block is designed to select and return one of the eight available input channels based on the input channel selector value. It leverages a switch statement for the implementation. This statement maps the input selector value 'chan' to the relevant channel input (s0 to s7) and returns the corresponding data. As such, it behaves as a multiplexer in the context of data or signal routing. The data width for each channel and the source return is 16 bits."
