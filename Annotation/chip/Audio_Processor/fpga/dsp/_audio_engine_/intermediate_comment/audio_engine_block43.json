    "block_comment": "This block of code is defining a register called 'frame_counter' using Verilog RTL. Its size is determined by the value of FRAME_W minus one with indices starting from zero. The function of this register is to keep track of the number of frames, typically used in operations such as frame synchronization or frame counting in digital systems. It is initialized to zero, indicating that counting begins from zero in this context."
