    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the parameters for an audio processing system. It sets the number of audio channels and frames, assigns a unique code for each audio sample, performs calculation on the width of the unique code and coefficients, calculates the total number of audio samples, and determines their width in terms of bits. These parameters are defined using the \"localparam\" keyword, ensuring they remain constant through the code, with the widths calculated using base 2 logarithms for digital design considerations."
