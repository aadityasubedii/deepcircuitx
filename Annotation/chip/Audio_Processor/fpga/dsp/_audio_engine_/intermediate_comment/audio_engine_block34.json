    "block_comment": "The block manages the offset values of incoming and outgoing I2S (Inter-IC Sound) data streams. It is designed with two 4-bit registers, `i2s_in_offset` and `i2s_out_offset`, representing the offset values of the incoming and outgoing streams, respectively. The offset for an incoming I2S stream is processed by the module `i2s_offset_in`. The offset value gets updated when the I2S enable signal (`i2s_en`) is high and a new I2S sample (`i2s_in_sample`) comes in. The module `i2s_offset_in` is instantiated with a width parameter of 4, matching the register bit-width."
