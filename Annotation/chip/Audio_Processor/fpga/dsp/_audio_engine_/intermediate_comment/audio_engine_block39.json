    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes an instance of an `i2s_dual` module with a specified clock divider. The `i2s_dual` module interfaces with an I2S (Inter-IC Sound) external hardware, determining its clock, write strobe, frame position, and possible external controlling signals. The clock values and reset signal given by the wishbone bus (wb) dictates the operation. The enabling signal `i2s_en` allows the operations of the module. The signals `sck` (serial clock) and `ws` (word select) are connected to the appropriate I2S wires, and the `frame_posn` signal gives the current frame position. The `i2s_external` parameter indicates whether the module is in external mode (external clock and word select)."
