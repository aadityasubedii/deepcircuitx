    "block_comment": "This block defines a 32-bit wide wire `control_reg`. The `control_reg` is assigned a concatenation of four values, each playing a distinct part in its formation. Bits `[31:FRAME_W+2]` are filled with `0s`. The next field is `control_reg_frame`, whose width is not explicitly defined here, followed by a single-bit field `i2s_external` and another single-bit field `allow_audio_writes`. These represent different configurable control settings, with `i2s_external` and `allow_audio_writes` implying I2S external control activation and permission for audio writes, respectively."
