    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing receive operations for three distinct I2S (Inter-IC Sound) interfaces, each associated with a different microphone input. The function is achieved by instantiating three instances of the i2s_rx module, configured with the same number of bits (MIC_W) and clocks (I2S_BITS). Each microphone (mic_2 to mic_7) data is captured in left and right channels from the respective I2S data streams (sd_in1 to sd_in3), all synchronized with a common clock (ck) and sample pulse (i2s_in_sample)."
