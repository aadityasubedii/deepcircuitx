    "block_comment": "The block of code is a call to a module called `chip_select` that controls selective access to the data bus. It implements this by using the signal `wb_ck` for synchronization, the signal `addr` to hold the address of the target peripheral, the signal `wb_cyc` to indicate a valid access cycle, and `wb_rst` to reset the module. The `ack` and `cyc` signals deal with acknowledgment and cycle status of the data bus, respectively."
