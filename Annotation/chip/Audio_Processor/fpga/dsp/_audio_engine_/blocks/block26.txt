This block is a function that identifies the source of a microphone input on a given channel. It achieves this function by invoking the get_source() method. This method takes in the specific channel and the range of values from eight different microphone inputs (mic_0 to mic_7) each limited with two constants (MIC_HI and MIC_LO) to designate the high and low bit positions.
