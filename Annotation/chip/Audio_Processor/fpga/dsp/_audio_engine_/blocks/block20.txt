This block is an instantiation of the `sequencer` module which manages different functionalities of a digital system such as handling frames, audio data, coefficient data, and error capturing. The `sequencer` operates synchronously under a clock `ck` and can be reset using `rst`. Furthermore, it handles reading coefficient and audio data through `coef_data` and `audio_in` ports, and assigns addressing for read or write through ports like `coef_addr`, `audio_raddr`, and `out_addr`. The module also receives and sends sequences of audio data, indicated by `seq_audio`, and their write enable signal, `seq_we`, respectively. Completion of a sequence and occurrence of any error are indicated by `seq_done` and `error` respectively. A `capture_out` port is also maintained for versatile hardware applications.
