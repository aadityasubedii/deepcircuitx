Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for setting up parameter addresses for a series of local parameters â€“ `ADDR_COEF`, `ADDR_RESULT`, `ADDR_STATUS`, `ADDR_INPUT`, and `ADDR_DMA`. It does so by taking a base address (`ADDR`), which is a constant parameter, and adding specified values to it for each subsequent address. Addition here is performed in hexadecimal format.
