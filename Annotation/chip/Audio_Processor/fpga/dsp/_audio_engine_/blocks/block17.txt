Comment: 
This line of Verilog code assigns the signal `done` the value of `seq_done`. This is a straightforward assignment using the Verilog `assign` keyword, which continuously drives the `done` signal with the value of `seq_done`. Any subsequent changes in `seq_done` would immediately affect the value of `done`.
