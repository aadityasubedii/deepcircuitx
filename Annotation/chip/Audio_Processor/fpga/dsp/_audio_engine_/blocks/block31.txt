The block serves as a receiver portion, specified twice, for an I2S audio data interface with two channels, left and right. It is defined by a MIC_W (Microphone width) and I2S_BITS parameters. The instance 'rx_0' receives data from SD_in0 through an I2S format, with synchronization through a clock 'ck' and organizes the received data into two channels: 'mic_0' and 'mic_1'. It utilizes implemented I2S (Inter-IC Sound) interface protocol.
