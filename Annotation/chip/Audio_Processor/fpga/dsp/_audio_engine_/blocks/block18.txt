Comment: 
The block is an audio data handler for a stereo sound system. On each positive edge of the clock signal, it checks if the write enable (seq_we) signal is high. If it is, it uses the lower two bits of the write address (seq_wr_addr[1:0]) to determine which of the four channels (left_0, right_0, left_1, or right_1) to write the incoming audio data (seq_audio) to.
