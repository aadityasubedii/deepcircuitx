Comment: 
This block of code is involved in implementing a status register in a Wishbone bus system. The 'status_addr' uses bits 2 through 4 of the Wishbone data bus address ('wb_dbus_adr') to map the status register. It also generates write-enable ('status_we') and read-enable ('status_re') signals for the status register. The 'status_we' signal is high when both the Wishbone data bus write-enable signal ('wb_dbus_we') and the status register cycle signal ('status_cyc') are high, indicating a write operation. Conversely, 'status_re' will be high when a 'status_cyc' is in progress and 'wb_dbus_we' is low, indicating a read operation.
