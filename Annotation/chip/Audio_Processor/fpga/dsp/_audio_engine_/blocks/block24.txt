Comment: 
This line of code assigns the value of the most significant byte of the Wishbone bus address to the chip select address. It achieves this function by using the 'assign' keyword to create a continuous assignment, which automatically updates the value of 'cs_adr' whenever 'wb_dbus_adr' changes. The bit-select operator '[31:24]' extracts the top 8 bits out of the 32-bit 'wb_dbus_adr' bus.
