This block of code is responsible for initializing the reset signal of the system. It initializes two reset-related registers, 'resetx' and 'reset_req', to zero. 'resetx' is a 2-bit register and 'reset_req' is a single bit register. Setting these signals to zero places the system into a reset state at the beginning.
