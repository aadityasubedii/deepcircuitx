Comment: 
This block of code controls write operations for a sequential audio memory block. The write-enable signal (`result_we`) is directly tied to the sequential write enable (`seq_we`), indicating that a write operation occurs whenever `seq_we` goes high. The write address (`result_waddr`) is sourcing from the sequential write address (`seq_wr_addr`), but with an extra zero bit at the most significant position as a countermeasure against potential overflows. Finally, the data to be written into memory (`result_wdata`) comes directly from the sequential audio data (`seq_audio`).
