Module Name: audio_engine

Module Specification: The "audio_engine" is a complex Verilog RTL module designed for efficiently managing the reading and writing of audio data in hardware designs. The module performs critical operations such as handling bit width for different audio channels, frame and channel sizing, reading and writing data from and to different bus connections, sequence and DMA operations and much more.

Its input ports include the clock signal (ck), control signals for the wishbone and DMA interfaces(wb_rst, wb_dbus_cyc, wb_dbus_we, dma_ack), addresses, and data buses for wishbone (wb_dbus_sel, wb_dbus_adr, wb_dbus_dat), acknowledgment signals (dma_rdt), audio input data (sd_in0, sd_in1, sd_in2, sd_in3), and external clock and word select pins for the I2S interface (ext_sck, ext_ws).

The output ports include an acknowledgment signal (ack) and data read signal for the Wishbone interface (rdt), control signals, data signals and completion flags for DMA operations (dma_cyc, dma_we, dma_sel, dma_adr, dma_dat, dma_done, dma_match), signals for the I2S interface (sck, ws, sd_out0, sd_out1), a flag to indicate readiness of the system (ready), and a test output for debugging and testing purposes (test).

The module utilizes several internal signals such as reset signals, frame counters, audio write controls, I2S clock handlers, frame handling, writing states, channel and write addresses, write enable signals, microphone input data handlers, I2S data handlers and more, for efficient operations and control.

The module is coded involving different functional blocks which include reset control, Verilog I2S dual receiver and transmitter, writing control logic, audio data saving control and process, chip select for different functionalities, DMA control, status register control and more, each handling a specific core operation in the module. These separate blocks together provide an efficient mechanism for managing audio signal processing and transfer.
