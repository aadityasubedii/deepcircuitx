    "block_comment": "This block is a clock-triggered, conditional statement used for performing arithmetic operations. Dependent on clock edge and enable signal, it adds or subtracts an input value from its previous value. The block utilizes an always keyword to operate at every positive edge of the clock if 'en' is high. If 'add' is high, then the block adds 'to_add' value to 'prev', otherwise it subtracts 'to_add' from 'prev', storing the result in 'out'."
