    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is used to create a resettable latch, which holds a value across clock cycles. When the reset (rst) signal is asserted (high or '1'), the output 'prev' is reset to 0. Otherwise, the previous 'out' value is held or latched in 'prev'. This mechanism allows the system to either maintain its current state or be reset based on the 'rst' input, implementing a form of memory or storage in digital logic circuits."
