    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes the output signal 'out' to zero before any simulation time has passed. It uses the 'initial' keyword to set the initial condition of the 'out' signal to low level (0). This is typically done to make sure the simulation starts from a known state, preventing potential undesired behavior due to floating or random initial states of signals."
