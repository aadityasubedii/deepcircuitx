It works based on the clock (ck) signal. When the enable (en) signal is on, it will execute addition if the \"add\" signal is true, otherwise, it will execute subtraction. The performed operation will be on the input data given (in), and the previous value outputted (out). The operation result will be stored in \"out.\" Also, whenever a reset (rst) signal comes, it resets the previous value to zero."
