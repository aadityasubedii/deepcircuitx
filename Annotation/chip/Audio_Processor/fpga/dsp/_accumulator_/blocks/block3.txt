Comment: 
The function of this block is to append zeros to the input 'in', producing a new output 'to_add'. This operation is achieved by using the concatenation operator, represented by '{ }' in Verilog. It combines 'zeros' and 'in' into a single vector 'to_add'. 'in' constitutes the least significant bits of 'to_add' while 'zeros' constitute the most significant bits.
