Comment: 
This block of code is used to assign a constant zero value to a wire or variable named 'zeros'. This zero assignment block is instantiated through the Verilog 'assign' statement, immediately giving the 'zeros' wire or variable a value of zero and maintaining this value throughout the scope of its use. This is generally done for condition checking, allowing 'zeros' to be used whenever a constant zero value is needed without performing additional operations.
