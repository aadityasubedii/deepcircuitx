Module-level comment: This module, accumulator, performs addition or subtraction on a 32-bit input ('in') triggered by a clock pulse and enabled by an 'en' signal. The arithmetic operation is chosen by the 'add' signal. The result is stored in the signed 'out' of OUT_W width. Internally, the 'in' is concatenated with 'zeros' to match 'out' width, forming 'to_add'. The 'prev' retains the previous 'out' value, resetting to zero on 'rst'. The always block, engaged on a clock pulse and 'en' high, computes the new 'out' by adding or subtracting 'to_add' from 'prev'.
