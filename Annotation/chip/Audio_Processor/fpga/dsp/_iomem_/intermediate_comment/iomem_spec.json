    "spec": "Module name: iomem. \n\nModule specification: This module, known as 'iomem', manages the interactions with an I/O memory block. The module responds to a valid input, an address within a specific range, and a system readiness status to perform either a read or write operation. \n\nThe module contains several input ports. The 'ck' input is the clock signal governing all synchronous operations. The 'valid' input indicates if the incoming address and data are valid. The 'wstrb', a 4-bit input, serves as the strobe for enabling byte lanes during a write operation, while 'addr', a 32-bit address input, specifies the location for the read/write operation. \n\nThe output ports include 'ready', which shows if the module is prepared for the next operation, 'we' which enables a write operation, and 're', responsible for enabling a read operation. \n\nInternally, 'iomem' uses 'enable', which is high when a valid operation is ready to commence, 'write', which indicates if a write operation should occur based on 'wstrb', 'we', the write operation signal, and 're', the read operation signal.\n\nThe Verilog code is split into several blocks. The input and output port declarations and parameter definitions are first, followed by initialization of 'ready' signal. After, the 'enable' and 'write' signals are declared and assigned using input signals. The signals 'we' and 're' are generated from 'enable' and 'write'. Finally, there is an 'always' block, which uses a 'posedge ck' trigger to control the 'ready' signal and ensure only one operation is executed at a time. Thus, the 'iomem' module efficiently manages read/write operations with an I/O memory block.",
