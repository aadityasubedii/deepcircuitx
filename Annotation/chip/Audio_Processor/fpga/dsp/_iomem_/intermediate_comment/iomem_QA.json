It handles read and write enable logic based on a valid input, an address within a specific range, and whether the system is ready for a new operation or not. It ensures that only one operation occurs at a time by utilizing the ready signal which is set when an operation is enabled and reset once it's completed. The specific operation (read/write) is determined by the 'wstrb' signal."
