    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'iomem' module manages I/O memory block interactions by facilitating read/write operations. It uses input signals 'valid', 'wstrb', and 'addr' with internal signals 'enable', 'write', 'we' and 're' to control the operations. 'enable' validates operation readiness, 'write' triggers a write operation, and 'we' and 're' enable the write or read operation respectively. The 'ck' clock signal synchronizes it all. Operational flow is controlled by an 'always' block, ensuring one operation at a time based on system's readiness ('ready' signal)."
