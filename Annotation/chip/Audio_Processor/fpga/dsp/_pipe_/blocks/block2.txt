This block of code provided is missing its essential details and hence, it's not possible to provide a meaningful function or implementation details. It seems to be the ending part of an 'endgenerate' structure in Verilog, a construct used to instantiate multiple instances of modules or other generate constructs in a loop. Please provide a more comprehensive code block so I can give you an accurate function and implementation details.
