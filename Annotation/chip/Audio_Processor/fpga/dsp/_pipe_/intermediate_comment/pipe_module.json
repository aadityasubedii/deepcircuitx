    "module": "Module-level comment: \"The 'pipe' module functions as a shift register or delay line of length 'LENGTH'. It receives an input bit at each clock cycle and shifts it sequentially through the delay line, with the most significant bit assigned to the output. For a LENGTH of 1, the input goes directly to the output at the next clock cycle. If LENGTH is greater than 1, the input bit gets pushed through the delay line. The shift operation happens at each clock edge and the delay line is initialized to the value of the 'INIT' parameter. Implementation is achieved using an internal register array 'delay' and a conditional generate construct.\""
