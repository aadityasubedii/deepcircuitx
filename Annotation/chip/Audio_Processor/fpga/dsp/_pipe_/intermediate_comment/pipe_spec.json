    "spec": "Module name: pipe. \n\nModule specification: The 'pipe' module operates as a delay line or shift register, where the length of the delay line is determined by the LENGTH parameter. This module receives an input bit through the 'in' port at each clock cycle, indicated by the 'ck' port, and shifts it through the delay line. Depending on the LENGTH parameter, if it's 1, the input bit goes directly to the output 'out' port at the next clock cycle. If the LENGTH is more than 1, the input bit gets sequentially shifted through the delay line at each clock edge. The module uses an internal register array named 'delay', which acts as a delay line and its size get determined by the LENGTH parameter. This 'delay' line contains the incoming data bits and progressively pushes them out when new data comes in. The most-significant bit of the 'delay' line is assigned to the output 'out'. The delay line gets initialized to the value specified by the INIT parameter. The module uses a generate-conditional construct to differentiate between the cases when LENGTH is 1 and when it's more than 1. This module's simple yet effective design allows it to be used for a variety of applications such as buffering, pipelining, and other digital signal processing tasks.",
