    "block_comment": "This block functions as a delay line or shift register. On each positive edge of the clock signal 'ck', it shifts the sequence of bits stored in 'delay' towards the left (most significant bit end) and stores the value of 'in' into the least significant bit of 'delay'. Hence, over multiple clock cycles, the values of 'in' are progressively delayed. This action is carried out using the concatenation operator to combine the current values of 'delay' (excluding the most significant bit) with 'in'."
