It takes an input and shifts it through a delay line or shift register. The delay line's length is determined by the LENGTH parameter. If LENGTH equals 1, the input simply goes directly to output at the next clock cycle. If LENGTH is greater than 1, the input gets shifted through the delay line at each clock cycle. The output is always the last bit in the delay line. The delay line gets initialized to the value specified by INIT.\n"
