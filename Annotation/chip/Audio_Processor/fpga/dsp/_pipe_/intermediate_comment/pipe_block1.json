    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning the most significant bit of a delay line to an output. Specifically, it creates a connection between the last element of the 'delay' array, which is a vector of a certain length defined by 'LENGTH', and the 'out' output wire. It essentially allows the most delayed signal in the line to be output."
