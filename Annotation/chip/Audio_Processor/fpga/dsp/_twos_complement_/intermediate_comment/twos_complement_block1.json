    "block_comment": "The block of code is a flip-flop that either inverts or buffers an input signal based on an inversion control signal. Under the control of a positive clock edge, the value of the input signal \"in\" gets assigned to the output \"out\". If the inversion signal \"inv\" is true, the block performs bitwise negation on the input signal and adds 1 to it, effectively realizing a two's complement operation to invert the signal. If \"inv\" is not true, it behaves like a buffer passing the input signal to output directly."
