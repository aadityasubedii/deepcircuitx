    "spec": "Module name: twos_complement. \n\nModule specification: The twos_complement module is intended to compute the two's complement of a binary input or relay the input directly based on the state of the 'inv' signal on the rising edge of a clock signal. The input ports to the module are the clock signal 'ck', the invert trigger 'inv', and the binary input 'in' that undergoes the operation. The 'ck' signal manages the timing of the module's operations, while 'inv' determines whether the input 'in' would be assigned directly to the output 'out' or if its two's complement will be calculated and assigned. The width of the signals 'in' and 'out' is determined by the parameter 'WIDTH', by default set to 16. There are no internal signals used in the module; the transformation is done directly within an 'always' block in the code. The output port of the module is 'out', which will contain the product of the processing, whether that be the original input 'in' or its two's complement depending on the 'inv' signal. The module\u2019s process flows from assigning the 'out' with a default value of 0 at initialization, then awaits a positive edge on the clock for further operations. At every positive edge of the clock, the 'always' block is executed where the condition of 'inv' is checked and operations are carried out accordingly.",
