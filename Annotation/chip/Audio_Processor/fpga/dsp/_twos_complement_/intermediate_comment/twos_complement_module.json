    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'twos_complement' module, parameterized by 'WIDTH' (default 16), processes an input signal 'in' on the positive edge of a clock signal 'ck'. If the 'inv' signal is high, 'out' holds the two's complement of 'in', otherwise 'in' is directly assigned to 'out'. This operation is done directly within an always block without the use of any internal signals."
