Comment: 
This block initiates the output signal 'out' to a low logic level. This is done during the initial state as the RTL simulation begins. It ensures that 'out' has a defined value at the start of the simulation, avoiding any undefined or 'X' states that may be problematic during the simulation or synthesis.
