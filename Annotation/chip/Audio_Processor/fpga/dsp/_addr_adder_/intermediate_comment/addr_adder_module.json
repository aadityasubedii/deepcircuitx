    "module": "Module-level comment: This addr_adder module adds two inputs ('frame' and 'offset', both of width FRAME_W) and concatenates the result with a third input ('chan', of width CHAN_W) at each positive edge of a clock signal ('ck'). This result is outputted to the 'addr' port, a register of combined width. No internal signals are used within the module. Major operations are achieved in a block defining actions on the clock's positive edge."
