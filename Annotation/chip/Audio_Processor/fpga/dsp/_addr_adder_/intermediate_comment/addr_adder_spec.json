It is defined with parameterized widths for the 'frame' and 'chan' signals. The module consists of four input ports and one output port. The 'ck' port is a clock signal responsible for triggering the operation with every positive edge. The 'frame' and 'offset' ports, both of the width 'FRAME_W', get added together whenever the clock signal rises. The 'chan' port has a width 'CHAN_W' is concatenated with the result of the addition. The result is subsequently outputted to the 'addr' port. This output port is a register with a size equal to the sum of 'FRAME_W' and 'CHAN_W'. The primary operation in the module is the addition and concatenation, which occurs purely as a response to the positive edge of the input clock. There are no internal signals used in this module.
