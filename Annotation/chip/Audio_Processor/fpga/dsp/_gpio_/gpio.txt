Module-level comment: The "gpio" module serves as a General Purpose I/O interface for managing write/read operations to a 32-bit register "gpio_reg". It uses clocked logic, with operations corresponding to the rising edge of 'ck'. Reset operation initializes "gpio_reg" to zero. The module inputs and outputs through "iomem_wdata" and "iomem_rdata" respectively, with validations indicated by "iomem_valid" and "iomem_ready". Byte lanes for write operation are managed by "iomem_wstrb". The state of "gpio_reg" is reflected on an 8-bit external LED array through 'leds' output.
