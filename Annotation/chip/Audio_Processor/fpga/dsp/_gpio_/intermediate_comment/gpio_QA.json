It uses a registered I/O memory interface with \"iomem_wdata\" as the write data line and \"iomem_rdata\" as the read data line. It includes a memory interface for specifying the granularity of data written/read. The GPIO module also handles the system's reset operation, in which it will initialize \"gpio_reg\" to 0. The data is led through a series of register assignments during the functionality of the module. Additionally, this module outputs directly to a 8-bit LED array. The operation of the module is controlled by clock signal 'ck' and reset signal 'rst'."
