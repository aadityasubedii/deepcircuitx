Module name: gpio.

Module specification: The "gpio" module serves as a General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) interface. It uses a synchronous design methodology, with all operations corresponding to the rising edge of the 'ck' clock signal. The module also provides the functionality of handling system's reset operations. The core functionality of the "gpio" is to allow data to be written to and read from the 32-bit register "gpio_reg". It receives inputs 'iomem_wdata' and 'iomem_addr' along with 're' and 'we' for write and read operations respectively. The transactions are validated by the 'iomem_valid' signal and byte lanes for write operation are designated by 'iomem_wstrb'. After completion, the module raises the signal 'iomem_ready'. The "gpio" module directly feeds the value of "gpio_reg" to a 8-bit LED array through 'leds' output. The operations within the module are divided into different blocks like resetting the module when 'rst' signal is active, writing to "gpio_reg" when the 'we' signal is active, and reading from the "gpio_reg" when the 're' signal is active. The "gpio" module provides a simple and direct way for managing general purpose I/O operations hence proving it crucial in any digital system.
