    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents a register for databus read data capture. The register is updated with the value from the databus read data (dbus_rdt) at the positive edge of write back clock (wb_clk), but only when dbus acknowledgement signal (dbus_ack) is true. This design ensures that the read data are only captured under the specified condition, synchronizing data read operations with the system clock."
