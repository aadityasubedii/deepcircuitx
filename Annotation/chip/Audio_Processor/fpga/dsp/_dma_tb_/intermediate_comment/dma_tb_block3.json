    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing data transfer. The functionality of this block is achieved using a conditional statement to determine whether to shift a constant hexadecimal value ('1111') by a certain address `xfer_adr` or set the `xfer_dat` to 0. Specifically, this occurs depending on the value of `xfer_re`: if `xfer_re` is true, it performs the shift operation, else the value of `xfer_dat` is set to 0."
