    "block_comment": "This block pertains to the instantiation and configuration of a Direct Memory Access (DMA) module. The DMA module enables high-speed data transfer directly between memory and peripheral devices while bypassing the CPU. The block sets address space and data width, as well as controlling setups for data transfer and addressing. In this implementation, the DMA processes both read and write transactions, with signals to start and complete transactions, and perform necessary handshaking (acknowledgment signals)."
