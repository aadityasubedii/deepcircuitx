Comment: 
This block of code monitors the status of the 'dbus_ack' signal in a Wishbone Bus communication scheme. As the operation is performed at the rising edge of 'wb_clk', this is a synchronous process. When 'dbus_ack' is high, the block resets its bus cycle ('wb_dbus_cyc') and write enable ('wb_dbus_we') flags and clears the address ('wb_dbus_adr') and data ('wb_dbus_dat') lines, setting them to high impedance state. The purpose of this is to prepare the bus for the next operation after a successful data transfer.
