Comment: 
This block manages signals for a Direct Memory Access (DMA) module, synchronized with a positive edge clock signal (wb_clk). At the occurrence of dma_cyc signal, which signifies that a DMA operation is ongoing, it sets the dma_ack (acknowledge signal) to a value of 1. This signal acts as an acknowledgment sent back to the initiator of the operation. Then, after receiving this acknowledge signal (dma_ack), it's reset back to its default state with a value of 0. This sequence ensures proper synchronization and completion of DMA operations.
