This task-block in Verilog code, named 'read_wait', waits for a signal acknowledgement from the data bus (dbus_ack) and then continues to wait until this acknowledgement signal is not present anymore. This is achieved by implementing two wait functions. The first 'wait' function places the task into a blocking state until 'dbus_ack' signal becomes true. Similarly, the next 'wait' function continues the blocking state until the 'dbus_ack' signal turns false.
