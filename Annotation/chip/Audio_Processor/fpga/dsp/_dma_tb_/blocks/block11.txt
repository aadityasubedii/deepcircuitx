The provided block of code defines a task in Verilog for writing data to a certain address. It is achieved by assigning the address and the data to be written, 'addr' and 'data', to the respective wires 'wb_dbus_adr' and 'wb_dbus_dat'. The cycle begins by making 'wb_dbus_cyc' high and the write enable 'wb_dbus_we' is also set high for the data writing process.
