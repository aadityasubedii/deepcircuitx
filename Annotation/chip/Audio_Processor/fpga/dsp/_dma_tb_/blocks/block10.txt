Comment: 
The block of code defines a task that initiates a synchronous write transaction and waits for its completion. When called, the task waits for positive acknowledgement ('dbus_ack' is high), indicating data bus is ready for writing data. After that it waits for negative acknowledgement ('dbus_ack' is low), suggesting the data has been successfully written on the data bus. The task is clocked at a positive edge of 'wb_clk', ensuring synchronous operation.
