This block of code in the testbench initiates the dumping of variable changes into a Value Change Dump (VCD) file for simulation debugging. It includes opening a file named "dsp.vcd" for the dumping activity by employing the $dumpfile system function. Then, the $dumpvars system function is used to start dumping all variables from the top of the testbench module, represented here as 'tb'. After a delay of 500000 time-units, set by the "#500000", the simulation is terminated courtesy of the $finish system function.
