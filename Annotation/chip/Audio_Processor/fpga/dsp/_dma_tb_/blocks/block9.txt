The block of code executes a fast transfer pulse. This function is achieved with a task called xfer_pulse, which starts by setting xfer_block to 1, waits for a positive edge on wb_clk signal, then resets xfer_block to zero and waits for another positive edge on the same clock. This process generates a brief high pulse on the xfer_block signal synchronized with the wb_clk signal.
