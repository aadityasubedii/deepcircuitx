Module-level comment: The 'tb' module provides a comprehensive test bench for a DMA controller. It initiates various actions like read, write, transfer operations by interacting with internal registers via Wishbone Bus and DMA signals. Based on different test scenarios, it writes to control registers and asserts data transfer pulses while continuously checking for status updates. Assertions are employed to ensure correctness of transferred data and state of the system. The 'tb' module doesn't have explicit input or output ports; all data transfers take place internally.
