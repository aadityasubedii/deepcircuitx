This block of code implements a peak and decay mechanism for an unsigned integer 'uint'. Upon a positive edge of the 'ck' signal, if the reset signal 'rst' is high, the 'max' value is reset to 0. If the 'peak_en' signal is high and 'uint' is greater than or equal to 'max', the 'max' value is updated to 'uint'. If the 'decay_en' signal is high and 'max' is more than 0, 'max' is decreased by 1.
