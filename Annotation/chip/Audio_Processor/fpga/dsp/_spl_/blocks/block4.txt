Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is used to assign the value of the variable 'max' to the variable 'out'. The 'assign' statement is an continuous assignment statement that perpetually assigns the value of the expression on its right (here 'max') to the variable on its left (here 'out'). The operation happens continuously, meaning that whenever the value of 'max' changes, the new value will be immediately assigned to 'out'.
