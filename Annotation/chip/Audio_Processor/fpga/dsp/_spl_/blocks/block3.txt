This Verilog block, a module named 'level', is designed to create a level indicator based on a given indicator width (IN_W) and the number of bits required (BITS). This module uses system function $clog2 to calculate the number of bits needed to represent IN_W in binary form. The module takes three inputs: a clock signal (ck), an enable signal (en), and a 'in' signal of width defined by IN_W. It outputs two wires named 'level' of width defined by BITS and 'ready'. The level shows the current level status and the ready wire indicates if the level calculation is done or not.
