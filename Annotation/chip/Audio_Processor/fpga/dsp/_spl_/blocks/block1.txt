Comment: 
This block of code is primarily responsible for level assignment and ready status checking. Firstly, it assigns the value of `bits` to `level`, indicating a direct mapping between these two variables. This could be a way to convert or represent the level in different terms considering the role `bits` portrays within the program. Secondly, it checks the status of `busy` and assigns the inverse of it to `ready`, essentially signalling if a particular operation or block is ready when it's not busy.
