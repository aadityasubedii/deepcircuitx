Module-Level Comment: 

spl: 
This module calculates and outputs the maximum value of a two's complement integer input ('in'). The maximum value is updated with 'peak_en', decreased with 'decay_en', and resets with 'rst'. Internally, 'uint' represents the positive value of 'in' and 'max' keeps track of the maximum value. Each functionality occurs depending on the state of control signals in different blocks of the code.

level: 
This module calculates the 'level' of an input value based on the enable signal ('en'). Upon enabling, the input shifts right and 'level' increases. If not enabled but 'busy', shifting continues until the two most significant bits differ, releasing 'busy' state. Internally, 'shift' holds the shifted input, 'bits' holds the level, and 'busy' indicates ongoing calculation.
