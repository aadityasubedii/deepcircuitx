Maximum value calculation starts afresh when 'rst' signal is asserted. Finally, the calculated maximum value is passed to the 'out' signal.\n\nModule 2:\nModule Name: level.\nExplanation: This module calculates the level of the input ('in') based on the enabled state ('en'). When enabled, the input is shifted and the level is increased. If the enabled state is not active and the module is 'busy', the shifting continues according to the binary rule and level calculation continues. The busyness of the module is released when two most significant bits of the shifted input are not equal. The calculated level and the readiness of the module are passed out as output signals."
