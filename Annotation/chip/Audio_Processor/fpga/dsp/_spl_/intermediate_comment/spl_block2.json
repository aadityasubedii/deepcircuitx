    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code implements a shift register with additional functionality to count the number of consecutive equal bits. Upon receiving a positive edge clock signal and when enabled, it sets 'shift' to the input value, 'bits' to zero, and 'busy' to 1, effectively initializing the system. When the system is 'busy' and not enabled, it checks if the last two bits of 'shift' are unequal, and if so, sets 'busy' to 0, indicating completion. If the last two bits are equal, it increments 'bits' and performs a shift with inverse of the last bit appended, thus continuing the process."
