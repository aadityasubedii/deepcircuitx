    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'tb' module, a testbench, tests a 'shifter' module by simulating it with various inputs under a clock signal 'ck'. The 'ck' signal toggles every 42ns and 'en' controls 'shifter'. 'shift' signals 'in' how many bits to right-shift, and 'out' holds the result. Simulation results are dumped in a '.vcd' file with a loop variable 'i' for generating different 'shift' values. This testbench checks whether 'out' equals the bitwise-AND of the right-shifted 'in' with 16'hFFFF, thereby ensuring the correctness of the 'shifter'."
