    "block_comment": "This block of code is a testbench for a shifting circuit. Initially, it assigns a 40-bit hexadecimal value to 'in' and enables the operation with 'en'. Following a couple of clock cycles, a for-loop is used to progressively shift the input 'in'. The 'shift' variable defines the number of positions to shift. After each shift, a testbench assertion checks if the output 'out' is equal to the shifted and masked input. This ensures the shift operation is correctly implemented in the main design."
