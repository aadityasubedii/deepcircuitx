Explanation: 'tb', short for testbench, is a module designed to verify the functional correctness of the hardware architecture, in this case, an audio engine. It interacts with the audio engine module by providing input signals and checking the outputs. These input signals and checks include write and read operations through the Wishbone bus interface (wb_dbus), resetting and clocking the engine, and writing values to specific addresses to test the response of the engine. The module also aids in flagging discrepancies during the simulation through certain asserted conditions. It also involves simulation controls such as the $dumpfile and $dumpvars commands for logging the simulation output. In essence, this module tests the proper functioning of the 'audio_engine' module."
