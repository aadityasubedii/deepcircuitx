    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the write back (WB) phase in a processor's pipeline during a positive edge clock cycle. Upon receiving an acknowledgment signal (`wb_dbus_ack`), it resets the values of the address(`wb_dbus_adr`), data(`wb_dbus_dat`), selector(`wb_dbus_sel`), write enable(`wb_dbus_we`), and cycle(`wb_dbus_cyc`) signals related to the WB phase. This is achieved by synchronizing the reset operation with the positive edge of the clock, ensuring a precise and robust control mechanism."
