    "spec": "Module name: tb. Module specification: The 'tb' is a testbench module designed to test the functionality of the 'audio_engine' module of an audio processing system. Due to its role as a testing module, the 'tb' does not require any input ports and does not provide any output ports. Inside the 'tb' module, several internal signals are used to simulate the conditions around the 'audio_engine', these include ck (clock signal), rst (reset signal), and various signals adhering to the Wishbone bus protocol like wb_dbus_cyc (to indicate a valid bus cycle), wb_dbus_we (to indicate a write operation), and wb_dbus_ack (to indicate successful read/write operations) amongst others. Various tasks and sections of the code play different roles such as the setting up of the simulation, emulating the operation of the system with the insertion of various audio data and control signals, reading data from the 'audio_engine', providing engineered write/read conditions, asserting and checking expected conditions, eventually leading to the evaluation of the performance and correctness of the 'audio_engine'. This module overall aids in validating and verifying the designed 'audio_engine' while flagging any discrepancies during the testing phase of the hardware design life cycle. This simulation is particularly controlled with the help of simulation control tasks like $dumpfile and $dumpvars which aid in dumping the simulation report in a user-friendly format.",

Due to its role as a testing module, the 'tb' does not require any input ports and does not provide any output ports. Inside the 'tb' module, several internal signals are used to simulate the conditions around the 'audio_engine', these include ck (clock signal), rst (reset signal), and various signals adhering to the Wishbone bus protocol like wb_dbus_cyc (to indicate a valid bus cycle), wb_dbus_we (to indicate a write operation), and wb_dbus_ack (to indicate successful read/write operations) amongst others. Various tasks and sections of the code play different roles such as the setting up of the simulation, emulating the operation of the system with the insertion of various audio data and control signals, reading data from the 'audio_engine', providing engineered write/read conditions, asserting and checking expected conditions, eventually leading to the evaluation of the performance and correctness of the 'audio_engine'. This module overall aids in validating and verifying the designed 'audio_engine' while flagging any discrepancies during the testing phase of the hardware design life cycle. This simulation is particularly controlled with the help of simulation control tasks like $dumpfile and $dumpvars which aid in dumping the simulation report in a user-friendly format."
