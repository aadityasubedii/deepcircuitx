    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a task to write data to a specific address on wishbone interconnect. In the task, the given address and data inputs are assigned to 'wb_dbus_adr' and 'wb_dbus_dat', respectively. The 'wb_dbus_sel' is set to all 1's indicating a data write operation on all byte enable lines, and 'wb_dbus_we' and 'wb_dbus_cyc' values are set to 1 to confirm a write operation cycle. It then waits for a clock cycle with the @(posedge ck) command and the task is only completed when the 'wb_dbus_cyc' is negated, indicating that the data write cycle has successfully ended."
