    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'tb' module serves as a testbench to validate 'audio_engine' functionality. It generates internal signals like clock, reset, and Wishbone protocol signals for control and data transactions performed on the 'audio_engine'. It features 'write' and 'read' tasks for modulating the state and reading out the state of the audio engine respectively. The module essentially conditions the 'audio_engine' with a test situation, checks the response of the 'audio_engine' and asserts for expected outcomes in its operation. Simulation control tasks are also used to create a readable simulation log."
