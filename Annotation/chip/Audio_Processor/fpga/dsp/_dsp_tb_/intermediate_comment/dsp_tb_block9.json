    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to generate a clock signal. It leverages the \"always\" keyword in Verilog, a language feature that implies combinational timing, meaning the block will always execute after a delay of 42 units of simulation time. Specifically, the block toggles the \"ck\" signal after that delay, creating a continuous clock signal for simulation purposes."
