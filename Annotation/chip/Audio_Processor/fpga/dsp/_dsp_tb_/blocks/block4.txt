Comment: 
This block of code is essentially monitoring a particular status on a bus in a digital design. At every positive edge of the clock, if the "wb_dbus_cyc" signal is not set (probably indicating that the bus cycle is not ongoing), the code checks whether the data from the "wb_dbus_rdt" signal (likely representing bus read data) is zero and asserts an error if not. It seems to ensure that no spurious data is being read when the bus cycle is inactive.
