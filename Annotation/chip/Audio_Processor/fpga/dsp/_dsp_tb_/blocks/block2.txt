Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code assigns a constant value to a wire signal. The wire signal, denoted as "ws", is given a constant value of 0. This operation is executed whenever the circuit that the code describes is synthesized. The wire "ws" will always hold the value zero, no matter when it is accessed, showing it's acting as a permanently low (0 value) signal.
