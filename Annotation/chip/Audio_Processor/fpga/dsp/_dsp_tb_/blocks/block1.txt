The block of code performs a sequence of operations involving system setup, data writing, status checking, and data reading. It first waits for system reset to complete and then waits for three positive edges of a clock signal to ensure system stability. The block then writes to several memory addresses, including the coefficient and the reset signal, and checks for the readiness of the engine. It also utilizes a polling mechanism to confirm the operational status before reading the data and validating the read data. The block finally repeats a similar sequence of operations as done at the beginning, after writing to an input address. Implementing these steps, the block ensures that the system is correctly configured, and the data integrity is preserved.
