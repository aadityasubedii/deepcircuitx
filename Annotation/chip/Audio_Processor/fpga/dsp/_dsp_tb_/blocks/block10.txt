This block of code is responsible for initializing and controlling simulation runtime. The function $dumpfile allows for the creation of a Value Change Dump (VCD) file named "dsp.vcd", which will store signal activities during simulation. $dumpvars sets the data to be dumped into the VCD file to include all variables (specified as "0") within the testbench ("tb"). A delay of 500000 simulation time units is then commenced before the simulation terminates, indicated by the call for $finish.
