This block initiates the process for Integrated Interchip Sound (I2S) tests and governs the signal transmission with clock synchronization. It commences by displaying the start message and then waits for the reset signal to deassert. It does a wait operation on word select (ws) signal, toggling it two times. Once done, it asserts the external reset(ext_rst), in a loop waiting for the rising edge of the system clock 30 times. Then, it deasserts the external reset, confirming the deassertion of the external flag, followed by repeating the wait operation on the ws signal six times. After these steps, it asserts the external flag and repeats the wait operation six more times. Finally, it re-asserts the external reset signal, goes through the toggling of ws signal twice, and as the last step, again confirms the deassertion of the external flag. The test concludes by displaying a "done" message. The $finish command right at the end concludes the simulation.
