Module name: tb (testbench). 

Module specification: This module, 'tb', is a top-level testbench used to verify the functionality of an I2S bus system. It creates and monitors stimuli for testing two sub-modules: an 'i2s_clock' and an 'i2s_dual'. 

This standalone module doesn't have any external input or output ports as it generates and handles signals internally. Inputs are created as internal signals to feed into the sub-modules being tested. Results of the tests are printed out via display messages rather than through explicit output ports. 

The module uses several internal signals like 'ck', 'rst', 'ext_rst', 'ext_en', 'ext_sck', 'ext_ws', 'ext_frame_posn', 'sck', 'ws', 'en', 'frame_posn', 'external', and 'i'.  The 'ck' signal acts as the main clock for the module while 'rst' is a reset signal for 'i2s_dual'. 'ext_rst' works as an external reset for 'i2s_clock'. Signals like 'ext_en', 'ext_sck', 'ext_ws', 'ext_frame_posn' represent enabling signal, serial clock, word select, and frame position for the external I2S clock. Similarly, 'sck', 'ws', 'en', 'frame_posn', 'external' serve as internal signals for the 'i2s_dual' module. 'i' is used as a counter in test loops. 

The verilog code for this module is divided into several blocks that initiate simulation, generate and monitor signals, and conduct several tests to observe the output of sub-modules under various conditions. It also handles the simulated clock signal and prints out test progression and results.
