    "module": "Module-level comment: This is a testbench module 'tb' designed to test the functionality of an I2S audio bus system. The module generates and monitors internal signals and carries out several test sequences on two sub-modules: 'i2s_clock' and 'i2s_dual'. It creates different test conditions by generating and analyzing signals and tests the system under multiple scenarios. No inputs and outputs are interfaced with the module; the test results are observed via display messages. The code also simulates clock signal behavior and handles reset conditions."
