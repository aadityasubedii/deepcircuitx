Comment: 
The block enables or disables part of a system based on an address range. In the event of a positive edge of the `wb_clk` clock signal, the block checks the condition `cyc`. If `cyc` is true, the 4bit slice (from index 5 to 2) of the `wb_dbus_adr` is checked against the hexadecimal value 'F'. If the values don't match, the system is enabled; otherwise it is disabled.
