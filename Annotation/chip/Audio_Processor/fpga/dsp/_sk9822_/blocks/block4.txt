Comment: 
The block assigns the value of 'led_half' to be true when 'prescale' is equal to half of the maximum count of 'PRESCALE'. This is achieved using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog, which creates a continuous assignment statement. Here, it's used to assign the value of the equality check between 'prescale' and half of the power of 2 raised to 'PRESCALE' to 'led_half'.
