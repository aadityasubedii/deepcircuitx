This block integrates a dual port RAM (dpram) module into the system, configured with a word size of 16 bits and an overall size of 16 words. The dpram is clocked off the wishbone bus clock signal (wb_clk), with the writing operation enabled by the conjunction of the acknowledgment signal (ack) and the wishbone bus write enable signal (wb_dbus_we). The write address and write data are specified by write_adr and wr_hi_dat respectively. The read operation is enabled by the ram_re signal. The read address and read data ports are mapped to ram_addr and rd_hi_dat respectively.
