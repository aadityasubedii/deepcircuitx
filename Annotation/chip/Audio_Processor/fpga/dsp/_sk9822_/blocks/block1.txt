Comment: 
This line of code assigns a value to the 'led_data' signal based on the state of the 'enabled' signal. If 'enabled' is true, this suggests that LED data is active and the value of the 32nd bit of the 'shift' register (indexed as 31) becomes the value of 'led_data'. But, if 'enabled' is false, 'led_data' is simply assigned a value of 0, suggesting the LED data output is inactive or off.
