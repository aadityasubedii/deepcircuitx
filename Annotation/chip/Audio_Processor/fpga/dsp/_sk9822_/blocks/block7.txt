This block of code declares and initializes a prescaler in Verilog. The prescaler is defined as a register array "prescale" with a size defined by the local parameter "PRESCALE"-1. The PRESCALE variable is set to 2, thus creating a 2-1=1 bit register array. Initially, the value of this register is set to zero.
