Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code handles the shifting and updating of 32-bit data (`tx_data`) with a progress being tracked by `bit_count`. On every positive edge of `wb_clk` clock cycle, if `led_en` is enabled, `bit_count` is incremented and data block `shift` is shifted right while a zero bit is added in the most significant bit (MSB) position. Simultaneously, the block checks if `bit_count` equals to zero, in which case it increments the `ram_addr` and based on the value of `ram_addr`, it updates the shift register with `tx_data` or different pre-defined values. The handling of LED clocks is done in the second part of the code block, where when `enabled` is true and `ram_addr` not equals to 14, `led_ck` is updated based on flags `led_en` and `led_half`.
