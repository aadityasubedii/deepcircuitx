    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a value to the signal or wire called `tx_data`. The assigned value is a 32-bit vector, with its highest 4-bit set to hexadecimal 'e' and the lower 28-bits filled with the 28 least significant bits of `ram_data`. The curly brackets `{}` are used in Verilog to concatenate bit vectors together. This code is useful when you want to append specific bits to the data read from RAM before transmitting it."
