    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily functions as a data partitioner that splits incoming 32-bit data into two distinct 16-bit halves. It accomplishes this function by first dividing the data bus ('wb_dbus_dat') into 'wr_lo_dat' and 'wr_hi_dat', each representing the lower and higher 16 bits of the input data respectively. Afterwards, it assigns these divided data parts to its corresponding chunks in 'ram_data' for further processing or storage. The code uses the 'assign' command to handle these data bits efficiently."
