The primary inputs of the module include clock (wb_clk), reset (wb_rst), cycle (wb_dbus_cyc), write enable (wb_dbus_we) and 32-bit data signals (wb_dbus_adr and wb_dbus_dat) associated with the WishBone bus. The module outputs an acknowledgment signal (ack), a clock signal (led_ck), and a data signal (led_data) for the LED strip. Internally, it uses signals like `enabled`, `cyc`, `ram_re`, `ram_addr`, `ram_data`, amongst others, to process the received data, control operation synchronization, manage the dual-port RAM (dpram), control the generation of the LED clock signal, manage the shift operations for LED data-line control, and count the shifted bits. The module contains different blocks that handle chip selection, address calculation, data writing to and reading from `dpram`, controlling pre-scaling operations for LED clock signal generation, and managing shift register operations for LED data-line control.",

This module uses Dual-Port RAM (dpram) to store and manage the incoming data stream.

The primary inputs of the module include clock (wb_clk), reset (wb_rst), cycle (wb_dbus_cyc), write enable (wb_dbus_we) and 32-bit data signals (wb_dbus_adr and wb_dbus_dat) associated with the WishBone bus. The module outputs an acknowledgment signal (ack), a clock signal (led_ck), and a data signal (led_data) for the LED strip. Internally, it uses signals like `enabled`, `cyc`, `ram_re`, `ram_addr`, `ram_data`, amongst others, to process the received data, control operation synchronization, manage the dual-port RAM (dpram), control the generation of the LED clock signal, manage the shift operations for LED data-line control, and count the shifted bits. The module contains different blocks that handle chip selection, address calculation, data writing to and reading from `dpram`, controlling pre-scaling operations for LED clock signal generation, and managing shift register operations for LED data-line control."
