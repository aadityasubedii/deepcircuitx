    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sk9822_peripheral` module manages data transfer between WishBone bus and SK9822 LED strip in a SoC. The module uses input signals `wb_clk`, `wb_rst`, `wb_dbus_cyc`, `wb_dbus_we`, `wb_dbus_adr`, `wb_dbus_dat` and generates output signals `ack`, `led_ck`, `led_data`. It employs internal signals like `enabled`, `cyc`, `ram_re`, `ram_addr` and `ram_data` to orchestrate the control of operations. The functionality is achieved through distinct blocks for chip selection, address computation, writing to and reading from `dpram`, LED clock signal generation, shift operations, and bit counting."
