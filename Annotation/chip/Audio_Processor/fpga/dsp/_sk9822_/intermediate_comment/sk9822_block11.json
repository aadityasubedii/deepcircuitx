    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to assign the value 1 to the signal named ram_re. Since the 'assign' statement in Verilog is used to drive logic in a circuit, this block is implementing a functionality where it holds or drives the ram_re signal to a constant high or logic 1. This operation is maintained across the complete course of simulation as this is a continuous assignment done at the time of initialization."
