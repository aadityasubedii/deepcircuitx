This module uses Dual-Port RAM (dpram) to store and manage the incoming data stream. The module also generates clock (led_ck) for the SK9822 and controls the LED data line through the output (led_data). It uses the wb_dbus signal to read and write from the memory and interfaces with a chip select module. If enabled, the module performs constant shifting operations and uses a pre-scaler to control the clock signal cycle. The LED data is activated based on the enabled status and the highest bit (31) of the shift operation."

It becomes active when a valid data cycle starts. \n4. `wb_dbus_we`: This is the write enable signal for the Wishbone bus. It specifies whether the data cycle is a write cycle (if it is active) or a read cycle (if it is not active).\n5. `wb_dbus_adr`: This is a 32-bit address signal for the Wishbone bus. In this module, only the most significant byte and the 6th to 3rd bits are actually used.\n6. `wb_dbus_dat`: This is a 32-bit data signal for the Wishbone bus. It carries the data to be written during write cycles.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. `ack`: This acknowledgment signal becomes active when a valid presence of the chip is recognized, and it plays a role in write enablement to the dual-port RAM (dpram).\n2. `led_ck`: This is the clock signal for the SK9822 LED strip. The module generates this clock signal based on internal operations like pre-scaled clock and data shifting.\n3. `led_data`: This is the data signal for the SK9822 LED strip.
