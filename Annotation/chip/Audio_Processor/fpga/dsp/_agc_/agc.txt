Module-level comment: The "agc" module performs automatic gain control by normalizing and applying gain to input signals. The module's pipeline contains four main stages: finding maximum value (`max_in`), normalizing (`twos_complement`), obtaining the level (`level_mod`), and computing gain (`gain_mod`). Operational flow is controlled by internal states and transitions on a clock signal (`ck`). Output is generated when a multi-step processing chain has completed, as depicted by the `done` signal. Input (`in_data`) and output (`out`) are streamed in parallel using unique channel-addressing mechanisms (`src_addr`, `out_addr`).
