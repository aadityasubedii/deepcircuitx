This block of code implements a 2 clock cycle delay pipeline in Verilog. It uses a parameterized module `pipe` with a parameter `LENGTH` set to 2 to depict the delay length. The block is instantiated with signals 'ck' as the clock input, 'in_neg' as the data input, and 'neg_out' as the data output. The block ensures that the data 'in_neg' input into the pipe gets transferred to 'neg_out' after 2 clock cycles.
