Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for defining the logic assignation of `shift_by`. It establishes a relationship between the `shift_by` variable and `SHIFT` as well as `gain` variables. It is implemented by using the subtractive operation (-) on the shift value and the specific part of the gain in the given range. The specific part of the gain to perform the subtraction operation is extracted by bit slicing and defined by the constant `GAIN_W` and `SHIFT_W` where `SHIFT` and `GAIN_W` are also predefined constants in the module and `gain[]` is a bit vector.
