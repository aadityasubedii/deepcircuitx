Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for managing the status flags of a particular operation in a hardware design. The 'busy' flag indicates whether the operation is currently in progress or not, which is determined by the OR operation of 'busy_start' and 'out_we'. On the contrary, the 'done' flag is simply the negation of 'busy', meaning that when 'busy' is not active, i.e., the operation isn't ongoing, then 'done' is activated, signalling that the operation has been completed.
