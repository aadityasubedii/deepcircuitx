    "block_comment": "This block defines a shift module in Verilog which performs bit shifting operations. The module adjusts the width of an incoming binary string (defined by \"in\") from an input width (\"IN_W\") to an output width (\"OUT_W\") by shifting bits specified by the \"shift\" input, which is clocked by \"ck\". The shift value and widths are parameterized to allow different configurations. This operation is particularly common in digital signal processing or control path logic where data width needs to be adjusted. The design uses systemic procedural connections with defined bit-widths in a digital module configuration."
