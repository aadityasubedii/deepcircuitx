    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to assign a connection from the 'shifted' node to the 'out' node. This is done using the 'assign' keyword which sets 'out' equal to 'shifted'. It essentially means that, whatever logical or digital signal value is on 'shifted' will be presented at 'out'. This connection is always active and updates automatically, reflecting any changes in the 'shifted' node on the 'out' node instantly."
