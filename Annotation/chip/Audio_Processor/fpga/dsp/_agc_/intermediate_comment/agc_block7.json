    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is tasked with implementing a two's complement operation for binary numbers of a defined width. In detail, it employs the \"twos_complement\" module with a width parameter set as \"OUT_W\", which stands for the output width of the two's complement operation. This parameterized width provides flexibility, enabling it to cater to binary numbers with varying lengths. Therefore, the function this block serves is computing the two's complement of a binary number, which is facilitated by the use of the parameterized \"twos_complement\" module."
