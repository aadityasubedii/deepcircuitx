    "block_comment": "The provided block of Verilog RTL code implements a logic for shifting an input signal of width IN_W to the right by 'shift' bits and assigns it to an output signal 'shifted' of width OUT_W. In this 'for' loop which runs for OUT_W times, each bit from the input signal starting from the least significant bit, shifted by 'shift' bits is being assigned to the corresponding 'shifted' bit in an inversely indexed manner for right shifting the signal."
