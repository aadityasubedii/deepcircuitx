    "block_comment": "This Verilog block defines an array of pipeline registers to delay a given address signal. The pipeline register module 'pipe' is parameterized by a length of 3 and instantiated CHAN_W times, where CHAN_W is a constant representing the width of the address bus. The clock signal 'ck' is input to each pipeline register. The address signal 'addr' is connected to the input of each pipeline register, and the output from each register is connected to 'out_addr'. The purpose of this block is to implement a delay mechanism in order to synchronize operations within a larger system."
