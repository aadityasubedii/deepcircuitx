    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially an initializer for the address variable in a memory system or in a system that needs addressing. The code makes sure that 'addr', which clearly stands for 'address', is initialized to a value of zero. It might be used to reset the address line in hardware, or perhaps it is to start an operation from the base address. Implementation-wise, it is achieved using 'initial' keyword which performs an initialization at the time the code is loaded onto the hardware."
