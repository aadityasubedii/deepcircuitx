    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a sequential logic block governed by a clock cycle, that functions as a mechanism to find the maximum value in a set of data (find_max sequence), and then engages an adjustable gain mechanism based on that maximum value (gain control sequence). The state machine starts when the `en` signal is high. The `address` is initialized to 0 and the `find_max` process is started. Within `find_max`, the block iterates over the data set defined by `CHANS`. When it has found the maximum data point, it triggers the `level_en` block, leading to a waiting state until `level_ready` is high. Once that criterion is met, the `gain_en` block is triggered, followed by an adjustable gain control sequence. Ultimately, the state machine controls a two-step process: finding the maximum value in a dataset and applying gain control based on this value."
