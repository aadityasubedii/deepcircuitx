    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a synchronous circuit that is sensitive to the rising edge of a clock signal 'ck'. When the enable 'en' signal is high, the flag 'busy_start' is set to '1' and the 'addr' value is reset to '0'. In the following clock cycles, if 'busy_start' is high, 'addr' will be incremented by '1' in every clock cycle. If 'addr' equals to 'CHANS-1', 'busy_start' will be reset to '0', causing the 'addr' to stop incrementing."
