    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for simulation control and waveform dump for debug. It first instructs the simulation to dump waveforms into a file named \"dsp.vcd\". Then, it specifies variable information to be dumped from the testbench (\"tb\"). Finally, it ends the simulation after a delay of 5000000 time units."
