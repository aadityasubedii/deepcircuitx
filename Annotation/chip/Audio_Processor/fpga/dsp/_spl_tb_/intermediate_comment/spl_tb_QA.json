It first simulates different input levels and assert that the output level code is as expected, testing the functionality of the 'level' module. Then it tests 'spl' in various conditions like activating peak_en and decay_en, testing it for negative reset and different inputs. 'tb' utilizes specific tasks, timing controls and assertion to fully test the functionality of those modules in various scenarios.
