    "spec": "Module name: tb. \n\nModule specification: The 'tb' module is a testbench module intended to verify the functionality of two other modules named 'spl' and 'level'. It simulates various input conditions using diverse test cases to validate that these modules process and output data accurately. The data analysis is comprehensive, and includes producing a waveform file ('dsp.vcd') for further testing and debugging purposes. \n\nThe module has multiple input ports that include 'ck', 'rst', 'peak_en', 'decay_en', 'in', 'level_en', and 'level_in'. 'ck' is the clock signal used for controlling operations timing, 'rst' is the reset signal, 'peak_en' and 'decay_en' flags enable or disable the peak and decay mode in the 'spl' module respectively, 'in' represents data input to 'spl' module, 'level_in' represents the input level value intended to be set and 'level_en' flag enables or disables the level set operation.\n\nThe output ports comprise 'out', 'level_code', and 'ready'. 'out' represents the output from 'spl' module, 'level_code' represents the coded level bit from the 'level' module, and 'ready' signal indicates readiness after a level set operation.\n\nThe module contains several internal signals such as 'ck' (clock pulse), 'rst' (reset), 'peak_en', 'decay_en', 'in', 'out', 'level_in', 'level_en', 'level_code', and 'ready', which control various operations within the modules. Additionally, an integer 'i' is used for iterating during testing of the 'spl' module with various inputs.\n\nOverall, the module's Verilog code consists of separate sections, including one for variables and ports declaration, one for the instantiation of the 'spl' and 'level' modules, one for creating individual tasks such as 'set_level' for testing, and finally, 'initial' blocks which contain the actual testing sequences for the 'spl' and 'level' modules in different scenarios.",

It simulates various input conditions using diverse test cases to validate that these modules process and output data accurately. The data analysis is comprehensive, and includes producing a waveform file ('dsp.vcd') for further testing and debugging purposes. \n\nThe module has multiple input ports that include 'ck', 'rst', 'peak_en', 'decay_en', 'in', 'level_en', and 'level_in'. 'ck' is the clock signal used for controlling operations timing, 'rst' is the reset signal, 'peak_en' and 'decay_en' flags enable or disable the peak and decay mode in the 'spl' module respectively, 'in' represents data input to 'spl' module, 'level_in' represents the input level value intended to be set and 'level_en' flag enables or disables the level set operation.\n\nThe output ports comprise 'out', 'level_code', and 'ready'. 'out' represents the output from 'spl' module, 'level_code' represents the coded level bit from the 'level' module, and 'ready' signal indicates readiness after a level set operation.\n\nThe module contains several internal signals such as 'ck' (clock pulse), 'rst' (reset), 'peak_en', 'decay_en', 'in', 'out', 'level_in', 'level_en', 'level_code', and 'ready', which control various operations within the modules. Additionally, an integer 'i' is used for iterating during testing of the 'spl' module with various inputs.\n\nOverall, the module's Verilog code consists of separate sections, including one for variables and ports declaration, one for the instantiation of the 'spl' and 'level' modules, one for creating individual tasks such as 'set_level' for testing, and finally, 'initial' blocks which contain the actual testing sequences for the 'spl' and 'level' modules in different scenarios."
