This block of code generates a testbench for a peak decay system. It first initializes the system, then toggles the 'peak_en' and 'decay_en' signals to simulate the behavior under various conditions. The system's response is tested using assertions to ensure it behaves as predicted. The code further tests the system's response under various inputs, incrementing the input progressively in a loop to examine its behavior under different levels. There are also checks in place to confirm that the system correctly resets and recovers from that reset. Lastly, the block ends with a finish command, terminating execution after all tests are run. The code executes different control instructions at the positive edge of the clock, allowing time for the system to respond and propagate any changes. The block also employs a simple wait function to observe the behavior of the system over time.
