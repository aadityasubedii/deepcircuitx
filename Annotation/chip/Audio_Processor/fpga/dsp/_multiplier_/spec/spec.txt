Module name: multiplier. Module specification: The 'multiplier' module is a simple yet fundamental module which executes binary multiplication on two 16-bit inputs to produce a 32-bit output. Functionality-wise, at every positive edge of the clock input 'ck', it multiplies the 16-bit inputs namely 'a' and 'b' and provides a 32-bit result in its output 'out'. The inputs and outputs in detail are as follows: 'ck' is a clock input which drives the operation of multiplication at every positive edge. 'a' and 'b' are the 16-bit data inputs to the multiplier. 'out' is the output which carries the result of multiplication i.e., a 32-bit number. Internally, there are no signals used within this module, making the design straightforward. The operation within this module is performed straightaway wherein multiplication happens at the positive edge of the clock and the result is assigned to the 'out'. This module is not fragmented into blocks or sections but is a single operation performing unit, making it simple and efficient.
