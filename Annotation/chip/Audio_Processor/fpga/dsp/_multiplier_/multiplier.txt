Module-level comment: Multiplier: This module takes in two 16-bit binary numbers (a, b) and a clock signal (ck). On each positive edge of 'ck', it multiplies 'a' and 'b', producing a 32-bit output ('out'). It's a single block of code implementing direct multiplication without use of any internal signals. Simplicity and operation at every clock pulse are its hallmarks.
