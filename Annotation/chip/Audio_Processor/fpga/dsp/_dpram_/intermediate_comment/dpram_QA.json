The module uses a single clock signal (`ck`). When a write enable signal (`we`) is high, the data (`wdata`) will be written into a RAM address specified by `waddr`. When a read enable signal (`re`) is high, data will be read from the RAM address specified by `raddr` and subsequently output under the `rdata` signal. The module size, bit width, and address width parameters are customizable."
