Module name: dpram. 

Module specification: The 'dpram' is a Verilog module that represents a dual-port Random Access Memory (RAM) with simultaneous read and write operations. It uses a single clock input `ck` to synchronize the operations. It contains two main input ports for enabling reading and writing, namely `re` and `we`, respectively. When the write enable `we` is high, the data called `wdata` is written into the memory at the address `waddr`, simultaneously when the read enable `re` is high, data is read from the memory address `raddr` and is put in the output port `rdata`. The data and address widths are customizable with parameters `BITS` and `SIZE`, providing flexibility in memory size. Within the module, there is an internal register array named `ram` used as the memory storage. The functioning of the module is divided into blocks that are executed at the positive edge of the clock cycle. If write enable is active, the code writes the data `wdata` at the specified `waddr` in the `ram`. If read enable is active, the code reads the data from the `ram` at the specified `raddr` and puts it in `rdata`. This design refrains from any read-write conflicts ensuring proper memory operation.
