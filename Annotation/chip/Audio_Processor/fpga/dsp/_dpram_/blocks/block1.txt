Comment: 
The block of code performs Read Write operations on a synchronous RAM using a clock signal. During a positive edge clock cycle, it checks if a write enable (we) signal is activated; if true, it writes the data (wdata) into the specified RAM address (waddr). Additionally, if the read enable (re) signal is activated, it reads data from the RAM at the specified address (raddr) and assigns it to rdata. The write and read operations are separate to ensure that the block can perform both actions independently.
