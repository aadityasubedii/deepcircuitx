Module-level comment: This 'dpram' module performs dual-port RAM operations with a single clock signal. It reads and writes data simultaneously using `we` and `re` controls. At each positive clock edge, if write is enabled, data `wdata` is written at address `waddr` in the internal `ram` array, and if read is enabled, `rdata` reads data from the address `raddr` from `ram`. Parameters `BITS` and `SIZE` define the customizability of RAM size to suit different applications.
