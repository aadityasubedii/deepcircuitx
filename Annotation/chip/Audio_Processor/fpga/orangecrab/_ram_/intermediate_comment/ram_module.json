    "module": "Module-level comment: This sp_ram module acts as a single port Random Access Memory (RAM) with a size of 8*1024 32-bit words, utilizing a clock 'ck' for its operation. Using a Write Enable signal 'we', the module performs write operations, writing 'wdata' into a memory array 'mem' at an address 'addr' and a byte selected by 'sel'. The module always outputs the data from the memory array 'mem' at the address 'addr' to 'rdata' upon every positive clock edge. The internal memory 'mem' is used for storing data during read/write operations."
