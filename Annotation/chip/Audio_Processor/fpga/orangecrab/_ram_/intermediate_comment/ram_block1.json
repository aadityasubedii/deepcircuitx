    "block_comment": "This block of code comprises a memory write and read operation in a synchronous design. Based on the clock's positive edge, the write operation is enabled with 'we', and 'sel' bits determine which byte is written. The memory location to be written to is specified by 'addr', and 'wdata' contains the data to write. The read operation is independent of the write enable and 'sel' bits and happens every clock cycle, where 'rdata' gets the data present at the 'addr' of 'mem'."
