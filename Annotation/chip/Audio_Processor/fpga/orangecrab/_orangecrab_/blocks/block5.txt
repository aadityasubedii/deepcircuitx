Comment: 
The `pll` module functions as a phase-locked loop, a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal. In this case, the input signal is `clock_in`, while `clock_out` is the output signal. The `locked` output indicates when the output signal's phase is in sync with the input. Implementation-wise, the module processes the input signal and aligns its phase with that of the output signal by adjusting the divisibility, multiplication, and phase offset. The `locked` wire will be set high once the input and output signals' phases match up.
