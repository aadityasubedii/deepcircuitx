Module-level comment for `top` module: 

`This 'top' module handles a clock divider and signal routing for peripherals. Inputs are 'clk' (main clock) and 'btn' (mapped to 'spi_miso'). Outputs include RGB signals, constant low outputs, SPI communication data, and some derived from the internal 29-bit 'divider' register. It instantiates a 'dsp' module for functionality like communication, LED control, and audio signal generation.`

Module-level comment for `pll` module: 

`The 'pll' module serves as a simple clock divider. It takes a clock input 'clock_in', produces an output clock 'clock_out' with half input frequency, and a 'locked' signal maintaining a constant high (1). This is achieved via an internal 'divide' signal that toggles at every rising edge of the input clock.`
