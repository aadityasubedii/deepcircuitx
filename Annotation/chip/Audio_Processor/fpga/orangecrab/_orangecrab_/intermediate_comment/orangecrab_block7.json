    "block_comment": "This block of code is an instance of a module named `dsp` operating at a frequency of 24MHz. The `dsp` module interfaces different hardware components such as external clock(`ext_ck`), transmission line(`tx`), SPI bus(`spi_sck`, `spi_cs`, `spi_mosi`, `spi_miso`), test module(`test`), LED controller(`led_ck`, `led_data`), and several audio interfaces(`sck`, `ws`, `sd_in0`, `sd_in1`, `sd_in2`, `sd_in3`, `o_sck`, `o_ws`, `o_sd`, `ext_sck`, `ext_ws`, `ext_sd`). The inputs and outputs are connected via these named ports to facilitate communication and interaction between various components of the overall system design."
