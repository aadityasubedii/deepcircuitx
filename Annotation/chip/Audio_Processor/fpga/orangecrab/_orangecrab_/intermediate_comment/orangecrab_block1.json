    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to set the 'locked' signal to a high level or '1'. This is done by using the 'assign' statement, which continuously drives the 'locked' signal to '1'. So, any changes in the right-hand side values are automatically reflected on the left-hand side, but in this simple case, '1' is a constant and doesn't change."
