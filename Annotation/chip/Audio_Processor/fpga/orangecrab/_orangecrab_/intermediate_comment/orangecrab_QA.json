Explanation: This module is responsible for maintaining a clock divider and signal routing for various peripherals. It internally uses a counter `divider` that increments on each clock edge. This counter is used to generate signals `r`, `g`, `b`, and `p10`. It also instantiates a digital signal processor (`dsp`) which has proximity as well as communication interfaces SPI and external clock among others.\n\n2. Module name: pll. Explanation: This is a simple clock divider module that divides an incoming clock frequency by two. It generates two output signals; one is a clock signal which is half the frequency of the input clock signal, and the other is a constant signal called `locked`, which is always high (1)."
