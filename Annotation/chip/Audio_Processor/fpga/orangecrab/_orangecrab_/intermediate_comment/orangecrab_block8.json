    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns the system clock (`clk`) to the signal `ext_ck`. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements, which means the `ext_ck` signal will continuously take the value of `clk`. This is typically done to make a system-wide clock available to specific modules or components under different names."
