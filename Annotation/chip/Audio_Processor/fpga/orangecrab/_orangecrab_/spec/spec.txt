Module name: `top`. 

Module specification: The `top` module serves as the main structure, that internally maintains a clock divider and signal routing for various peripherals. For this purpose, it takes two inputs: `clk`, which is the primary clock signal, and `btn`, used as the `spi_miso` signal. The module generates a multitude of outputs including `r`, `g`, and `b`, which are color signaling outputs, `p0`, `p1`, `p12`, and `p13` that are always kept low (0) for external interfacing, `p5`, `p6`, `p9` related to SPI communication, `p10` getting the 8th bit of a divider, and `p11` linked with `o_ws`. Internally, it maintains various signals including a 29-bit register `divider` that increments with each clock rise, `ext_ck` assigned with main input clock, and several others related to digital signal processor and peripherals functionalities. The `dsp` module is instantiated within the `top` module with parameters linked to the various internal signals, serving multiple functions like communication, LED control, and audio signal generation. The outputs `r`, `g`, `b` and `p10` are generated by picking specific bits from the `divider` register and the `spi_miso` signal is directly linked to the `btn` input.

Module name: `pll`. 

Module specification: The `pll` module acts as a simple clock divider, taking in a clock input `clock_in` and providing two outputs: `clock_out` which is the halved frequency of the input clock, and `locked` which is a constant high (1) signal, signifying that the clock division is locked and stable. The operation of halving the clock frequency is achieved by an internal signal `divide` which toggles its state on every rising edge of the input clock. The `divide` signal directly forms the `clock_out` signal and thus provides the required frequency division functionality.
