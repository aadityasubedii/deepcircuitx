Comment: 
The block executes a bitwise XOR operation on neg_x and neg_y, negates the result, and then assigns it to add_0 at the positive edge of the clock signal. It also assigns the value of add_0 to the acc_add at the same time. This block is essentially an adder block designed to perform an 'add with carry' operation by using the XOR operation to simulate addition, and the negation operation to simulate the carry operation.
