    "spec": "Module name: mac. \nModule specification: \nThe 'mac' is a Verilog module that functions as a multiplication and accumulation (MAC) unit. It performs the operation of multiplying the inputs, then accumulates the result over time. The functionality of this module is based on the multiplier and accumulator instances, and operates with signed 16-bit inputs which are converted to two's complement form if they're negative. The module is controlled by the inputs: clock (ck), enable (en), clear (clr), and request (req).\n\nThe module takes two 16-bit inputs 'x' and 'y' which are data to be operated on. The 'ck', 'en', and 'clr' signals coordinate the operation of the module. The 'req' signal will trigger a new computation. The module outputs a 40-bit accumulated result (out) and a 'done' signal that indicates when the computation is completed. Each output port serves a crucial role: 'out' provides the accumulated result; 'done' communicates the completion of computation to other units.\n\nInternally, the module uses an array of signals: neg_x, neg_y, ux, uy, mul_xy, acc_en, acc_rst, acc_add, add_0, and req_t1. The signals 'neg_x' and 'neg_y' capture whether inputs 'x' and 'y' are negative. 'ux', 'uy' values are the two's complement of 'x' and 'y' if they are negative. 'mul_xy' is the multiplied result of 'ux' and 'uy'. The signals 'acc_en', 'acc_rst', and 'acc_add' are used in accumulator and helps in managing the operation. 'add_0' is a helper variable and 'req_t1' triggers the 'done' state's clearing even one clock cycle after a new request signal. \n\nThe code of the module is divided into specific blocks which have clear responsibilities. The first block calculates the two's complement of the inputs if they are negative. This is followed by the multiplication block, and then the pipeline setup block that sets the correct timing for the enable and reset signals of the accumulator. Subsequent lines set the control for the accumulator. The accumulator block is where accumulation of computation happens. The 'done' signal is brought low with a new request or a clear command and brought high otherwise. This modular structure ensures that each part of the MAC operation, the 'mul' and 'acc' functions, along with the pipeline sequences, can function independently yet in an integrated manner.",
