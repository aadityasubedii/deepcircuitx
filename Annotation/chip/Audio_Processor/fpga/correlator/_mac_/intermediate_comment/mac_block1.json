    "block_comment": "This block generates a 'done' signal based on the flip-flop system's clock-edge condition. Initially triggered on a rising edge of the clock (ck), it resets the 'done' signal to 0 whenever there is a clear 'clr', request 'req', or 'req_t1' signal. If these signals are low or inactive, the 'done' signal is set to 1, indicating the task is complete."
