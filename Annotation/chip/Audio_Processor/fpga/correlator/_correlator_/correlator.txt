Module-level comment:
The 'top' module acts as a controller for a sub-module named 'mac', passing controlled data and control signals to it. It takes an external clock signal, CLK, which is passed as 'ck' to 'mac'. Control registers 'clr', 'acc_en', 'req' and data registers 'x', 'y' are initialized and passed into 'mac'. Outputs from 'mac', three control signals and a 40-bit 'acc_out' are mapped to internal wires. Module functionality relies on 'mac'; top module controls its inputs and outputs.
