    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a shifter module in Verilog. It takes as inputs the clock signal (ck), a constant enable signal of '1' (en), the amount of shift required (shift), and the accumulator output (acc_out). The output (audio) is the shifted version of accumulator signal (acc_out). The shifting operation is controlled by the shift input and occurs at every clock cycle due to the constant enable signal, and this allows for dynamic data manipulation."
