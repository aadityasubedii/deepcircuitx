    "module": "Module-level comment:\n\n1. `corr_fetch`: This module generates sequential addresses from a starting address, up to a given count. It becomes operational when enabled by a signal, outputting the generated address and signaling readiness for the subsequent address or completion state. The generation is managed by an internal `counter`.\n\n2. `highest_bit`: This module finds the position of the most significant set bit in an input signal. The identification process involves replication or inversion of the input signal, then shifting and bitwise OR-ing, computed over several stages defined by internal signals.\n\n3. `tb`: Acts as a test bench for testing the functionality of `corr_fetch` and `highest_bit` by generating control signals and test data, simulating output results, and iterating the testing process. Its functionality includes synchronization and the ability to reset to initial states."
