    "block_comment": "This block of code is tasked with initializing certain variables in the Verilog hardware design to their default states. The 'raddr' and 'ren' variables are set to 0, indicating their initial start states are idle or inactive. Simultaneously, the 'done' signal is also set to 0, indicating that no operations or tasks have been concluded when the system commences. The execution of this block happens initially and sets the ground for subsequent operations."
