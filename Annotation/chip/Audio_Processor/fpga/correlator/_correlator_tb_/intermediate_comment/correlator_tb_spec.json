    "spec": "Module name: corr_fetch. \nModule specification: The `corr_fetch` module takes a starting address and a count as inputs. When enabled (`en`), it generates sequential addresses up to a defined count starting from the `start_addr`. This operation can be activated via signal `start`. The resulting output is the generated address `raddr` and two signals indicating its readiness to fetch the next address `ren` and completion of address generation `done`. The internal `counter` keeps track of the number of remaining addresses to be generated.\n\nModule name: highest_bit. \nModule specification: The `highest_bit` module processes an N-bit input (`in`) and outputs (`out`) the position of the most significant bit set to 1, identified by synchronizing with the clock (`ck`). The module evaluates the input with a defined computational process, including shifting and OR-ing with internal signals from `bit_1` to `bit_64`, producing a copy of the input bit `normal` or its inverse, the signal `hi_bit`, which contains the position of the highest set bit in `normal`.\n\nModule name: tb. \nModule specification: The `tb` module serves as a test bench to verify the functionality of the aforementioned modules. This involves generating stimulus for `corr_fetch` and `highest_bit` modules and validating their output results. It is synchronized with a clock signal `ck` and supports reset function which aims to bring modules to their initial state (`reset`), as well as many internally defined signals serving as control signals (`we_x, re_x, clr, acc_en, req`), test data (`waddr_x,wdata_x, data_y`), simulated outputs (`acc_out, agc, audio, level_out`), and loop indices (`ii`) for running tests iteratively.

For module \"highest_bit\":\n\n   Internal Signals: `normal`, `bit_1`, `bit_2`, `bit_4`, `bit_8`, `bit_16`, `bit_32`, `bit_64`, `hi_bit`.\n   Explanation:\n      - The `normal` signal is a copy of the input signal, but if the most significant bit of the input signal is set, then `normal` is the bitwise NOT of the input.\n      - `bit_1` to `bit_64` are intermediate signals used to calculate the position of the most significant bit set to 1. Each stage does a bitwise OR of the input signal and a right-shifted version of the input signal, doubling the bit-width at each stage.\n      - `hi_bit` is the signal which contains the position of the highest set bit in the `normal` input.\n\n3. For module \"tb\":\n\n   Internal Signals: `ck, reset, rst, we_x, re_x, waddr_x, wdata_x, raddr_x, data_x, fetch_done, ADDR_W, COUNT_W, start, count, fetching, re_x, clr, acc_en, req, data_y, acc_out, acc_done, agc, shift, audio, level_out, level_in, ii`.\n   Explanation:\n      - `ck` is the clock signal used to synchronize the operations.\n      - `reset` is the reset signal used to re-initialize the test at the start.\n      - `rst` is a derived signal that is true when reset gets to the value 3.\n      - `we_x, re_x, waddr_x, waddr_x, wdata_x, raddr_x, data_x` are signals used for read and write operations in the ram memory.\n      - `fetch_done` is a signal indicating that the fetch process is complete.\n      - `ADDR_W, COUNT_W` are locally defined parameters indicating the address width and count width.\n      - `start, count` are control signals and the count for the `corr_fetch` module.\n      - `fetching` is an internal wire output from the corr_fetch module indicating that the module is fetching the next address.\n      - `clr, acc_en, req, data_y, acc_out, acc_done` are control and data signals for the multiplier-accumulator module named `mac`.\n      - `agc, shift, audio` are signals related to the automatic gain control and audio shift parts of the test bench.\n      - `level_out, level_in` are signals used for testing the highest_bit module.\n      - `ii` is a loop index for running tests iteratively."

                    "text": "Module name: corr_fetch. \nModule specification: The `corr_fetch` module takes a starting address and a count as inputs. When enabled (`en`), it generates sequential addresses up to a defined count starting from the `start_addr`. This operation can be activated via signal `start`. The resulting output is the generated address `raddr` and two signals indicating its readiness to fetch the next address `ren` and completion of address generation `done`. The internal `counter` keeps track of the number of remaining addresses to be generated.\n\nModule name: highest_bit. \nModule specification: The `highest_bit` module processes an N-bit input (`in`) and outputs (`out`) the position of the most significant bit set to 1, identified by synchronizing with the clock (`ck`). The module evaluates the input with a defined computational process, including shifting and OR-ing with internal signals from `bit_1` to `bit_64`, producing a copy of the input bit `normal` or its inverse, the signal `hi_bit`, which contains the position of the highest set bit in `normal`.\n\nModule name: tb. \nModule specification: The `tb` module serves as a test bench to verify the functionality of the aforementioned modules. This involves generating stimulus for `corr_fetch` and `highest_bit` modules and validating their output results. It is synchronized with a clock signal `ck` and supports reset function which aims to bring modules to their initial state (`reset`), as well as many internally defined signals serving as control signals (`we_x, re_x, clr, acc_en, req`), test data (`waddr_x,wdata_x, data_y`), simulated outputs (`acc_out, agc, audio, level_out`), and loop indices (`ii`) for running tests iteratively. The test bench does not have external input or output ports, as it serves primarily to test and validate the functionality of other modules."
