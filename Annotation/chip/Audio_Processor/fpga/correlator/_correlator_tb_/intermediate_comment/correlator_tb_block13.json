    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for implementing a reset counter in a sequential logic design. In each clock cycle, when a positive clock edge is detected, it checks if the reset value is not equal to 3. If that condition is true, it increments the reset counter by one, essentially providing a state-based reset capability. The implementation is achieved using an 'always' block with a rising edge trigger on the clock signal. The if-statement within does the check and increment operation on the reset variable."
