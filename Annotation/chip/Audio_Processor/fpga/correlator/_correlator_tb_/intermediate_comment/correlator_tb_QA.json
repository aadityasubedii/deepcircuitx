I provide below their basic functionality:\n\n1. Module name: corr_fetch.\nExplanation: This module takes a starting address and a count as inputs and sequentially generates addresses for the given count. It also generates a signal ren when it is ready to fetch the next address and a done signal indicating all addresses have been generated. \n\n2. Module name: highest_bit.\nExplanation: The module processes an N-bit input and outputs the position of the most significant bit set to 1. The operation is done in stages for efficient implementation in hardware by shifting and OR-ing the signal. \n\n3. Module name: tb.\nExplanation: The tb (Test bench) is the test module which is used to verify the functionality of the other modules. It includes stimulus generation for `corr_fetch`, `highest_bit` modules, and assertion checks to validate the output results. \n\nAdditionally, the Verilog code includes `tb_assert` as test task design, and it's used in the `tb` module for testing specific assumptions and assertions."
