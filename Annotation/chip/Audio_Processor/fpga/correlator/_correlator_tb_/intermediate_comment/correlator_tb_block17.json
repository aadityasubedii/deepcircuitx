    "block_comment": "This block of code essentially performs a bit manipulation process. The first line generates the 'hi_bit' output by executing an XOR operation of a 64-bit input with a right-shifted version of itself. The usage of the right shift operation by 1 position signifies a bitwise transform known as Gray code conversion. The second line declares an integer 'i', which based on the given context, could be used later in the code for looping or indexing purposes."
