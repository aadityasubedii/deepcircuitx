    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily functions to find the next highest power of two for a given input, 'in', having a size declared with macro 'WIDTH'. This is typically useful in context of binary numbers for addressing memory sizes. If the uppermost bit of 'in' is '1', the code bitwise negates 'in' else it retains 'in' as 'normal'. The process of finding the next highest power of two is implemented by a series of bitwise OR and shift operations. Each line performs an OR operation of the existing 'bit_x' value and 'bit_x' right-shifted by 'x' bits, effectively computing the cumulative OR over increasing bit widths. The final effective result is 'bit_64' which represents the next highest power of two."
