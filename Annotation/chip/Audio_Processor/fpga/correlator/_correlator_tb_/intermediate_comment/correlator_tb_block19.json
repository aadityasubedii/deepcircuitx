    "block_comment": "This module, `highest_bit`, finds the position of the most significant bit in a signed input. The width of the input can be configured using a parameter `WIDTH`, and accordingly, the width of the output is calculated as the ceil of logarithm base 2 of `WIDTH` to ensure it can accommodate the position value of the highest bit. The process is clocked, controlled by the input signal `ck`."
