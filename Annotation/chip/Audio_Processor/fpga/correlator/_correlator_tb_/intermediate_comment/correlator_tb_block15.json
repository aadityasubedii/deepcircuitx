    "block_comment": "This Verilog code defines a simple testbench module (tb), whose function is to generate a clock signal (ck). The clock signal is initially set to low (0). An 'always' block is used to toggle the clock signal (ck) every 42 time units, creating a periodic clock signal with a period of 84 time units. This is useful in verifying the timing of sequential logic in digital systems."
