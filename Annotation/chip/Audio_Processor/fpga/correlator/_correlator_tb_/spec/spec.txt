Module name: corr_fetch. 
Module specification: The `corr_fetch` module takes a starting address and a count as inputs. When enabled (`en`), it generates sequential addresses up to a defined count starting from the `start_addr`. This operation can be activated via signal `start`. The resulting output is the generated address `raddr` and two signals indicating its readiness to fetch the next address `ren` and completion of address generation `done`. The internal `counter` keeps track of the number of remaining addresses to be generated.

Module name: highest_bit. 
Module specification: The `highest_bit` module processes an N-bit input (`in`) and outputs (`out`) the position of the most significant bit set to 1, identified by synchronizing with the clock (`ck`). The module evaluates the input with a defined computational process, including shifting and OR-ing with internal signals from `bit_1` to `bit_64`, producing a copy of the input bit `normal` or its inverse, the signal `hi_bit`, which contains the position of the highest set bit in `normal`.

Module name: tb. 
Module specification: The `tb` module serves as a test bench to verify the functionality of the aforementioned modules. This involves generating stimulus for `corr_fetch` and `highest_bit` modules and validating their output results. It is synchronized with a clock signal `ck` and supports reset function which aims to bring modules to their initial state (`reset`), as well as many internally defined signals serving as control signals (`we_x, re_x, clr, acc_en, req`), test data (`waddr_x,wdata_x, data_y`), simulated outputs (`acc_out, agc, audio, level_out`), and loop indices (`ii`) for running tests iteratively. The test bench does not have external input or output ports, as it serves primarily to test and validate the functionality of other modules.
