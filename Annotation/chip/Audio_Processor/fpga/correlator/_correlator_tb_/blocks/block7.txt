Line number: 
[169, 169]
Comment: 
This line of code assigns the constant value of 14 to the variable 'shift'. The assignment operation is done statically and not inside a procedural block, which implies that this is happening concurrently and independently of clock cycles. This means the value of 'shift' is always 14 throughout the program, and this value is used later in the code, possibly for shifts or rotations.
