Comment: 
This block performs two main tasks: it synchronously assigns the states of 'acc_en' and 'req' signals, and manages the state of the 'clr' signal. On every positive edge of the clock signal 'ck', it sets 'acc_en' and 'req' to the value of 'fetching'. Additionally, it implements a simple conditional logic to handle a flag clear operation: when 'fetching' is HIGH and 'req' is LOW, 'clr' is set to HIGH, at which point, if 'clr' is set, it is then immediately reset to LOW. This acts as a one clock cycle signal to perform some sort of clear operation.
