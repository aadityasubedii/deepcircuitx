This block performs a series of tests on the 'highest_bit()' function with various input levels to ensure it properly identifies the highest set bit position in a 40-bit word. At the beginning of each clock cycle, the 'level_in' signal is reset to zero. Afterwards, specific test vectors are manually applied to the 'test_level()' function. Later, a loop is employed to automatically generate and test inputs where one bit is set at each position from 0 to 38. Further tests explore edge cases particularly focused on the highest bits and all bits being set. These tests ensure the robustness of the 'highest_bit()' function against wide variety of input scenarios.
