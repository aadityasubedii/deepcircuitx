This code block generates a priority encoder. On every rising edge of the clock signal (ck), it sets the output (out) to zero and then iteratively checks each bit from least significant bit to most significant bit in the signal (hi_bit). Whenever it finds a bit set to '1', it assigns the bit position to the output(out). The for loop and the if condition together form a priority encoder where the least significant '1' in the signal gets the priority.
