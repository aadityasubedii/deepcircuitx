Comment: 
The block assigns the value of the reset comparison with 3 to the rst signal. This operation is implemented with an assign keyword in Verilog which continually assesses the right-hand expression and assigns the evaluation to the left-hand net. When `reset` equals `3`, `rst` is assigned a value of `1`, otherwise, it will hold a value of `0`.
