    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code assigns the value of signal d3 to signal d2. It is essentially copying the value from d3 to d2 at every positive edge of the clock (if synchronous assignment is implied in a higher scope). This is a simple datapath assignment which operates on all bits of the defined signals at once."
