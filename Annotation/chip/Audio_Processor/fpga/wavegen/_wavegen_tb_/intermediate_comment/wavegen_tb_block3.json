    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a clock signal. It utilizes a 'delay' construct, indicated by the '#42', to invert the clock signal at regular intervals such that it mimics the behaviour of an actual clock ticking back and forth. The amount of delay for each tick (or the frequency of the clock) can be adjusted by changing the delay constant."
