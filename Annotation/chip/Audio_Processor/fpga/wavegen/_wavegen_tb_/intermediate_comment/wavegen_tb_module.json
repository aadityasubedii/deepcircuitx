    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\n/* The 'tb' module serves as a testbench for the 'top' module. It generates a clock signal 'ck' that toggles every 42ns. Four wires, d0-d3, are used as intermediary connections. d0 and d2 are respectively assigned the same values as d1 and d3. Also, it initiates a .vcd file dump for waveform viewing. Simulation ends at 500us. There's no complex logic, and it's aimed at providing controlled stimuli for the 'top' module. */"
