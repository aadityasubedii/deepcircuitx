Comment: 
This block of Verilog code initiates waveform generation and simulation termination. It opens a VCD (Value Change Dump) file "wavegen.vcd" for dumping waveform data and specifies the top-level testbench module "tb" for the dumping process. After a delay of 500000 time units, the simulation finishes. This block is typically used for debugging and viewing the timing of signals in the testbench environment.
