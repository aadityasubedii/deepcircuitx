Comment: 
This block of code is a baud rate counter in Verilog that increments at every negative edge of the clock signal. The counter increments from 0 to 104 exclusive and resets back to 0 when it hits 104, forming a cycle. The timing of this counter's cycle is likely set to adhere to some baud rate specification for a serial communication protocol implemented elsewhere in the hardware.
