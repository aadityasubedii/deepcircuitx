    "spec": "Module name: uart.\n\nModule specification: \n\nThe module named 'uart' acts as a simple representation of a Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) system, primarily designed to facilitate serial communication. Essential to constructing most types of device input-output functions, this module accepts a clock input `ck`, which is instrumental in controlling data transmission speed. Moreover, it is equipped to handle an 8-bit data input `tx_data`, which marks the information to be transmitted using the UART protocol.\n\nThe module provides three output ports. First, `tx` presents the serialized data output, derived from `tx_data` input. Secondly, the `ready` output signal provides an indication of the module's readiness to transmit the succeeding data byte. It indicates readiness by remaining high when there is no ongoing transmission, i.e., upon completion of transmitting one start bit, 8 data bits, and one stop bit. The `baud` output is the third feature, which signals the baud rate and turns high when the `baud_counter` hits half its upper limit, which is 50 in this case.\n\nFurthermore, the module also uses internal signals, including `baud_counter`, `count`, and `shift`. The `baud_counter` is a 7-bit wide signal that effectively generates a baud rate, controlling the TX data transmission speed. Secondly, the `count`, a 4-bit wide signal, keeps track of the transmitted bits, thereby efficiently tracking the start bit, 8 data bits, and the stop bit that form a UART frame. The `shift`, a 10-bit wide signal, essentially operates as a shift register, storing and transmitting data loaded from a frame composed of the start bit, the `tx_data`, and the stop bit.\n\nIn terms of code construction, the module comprises two prominent blocks. One block handles the `baud_counter` functioning through a conditional statement, aiding in controlling the modulation of the baud rate. The other block manages `count` and `shift` operations, significantly involved in formulating the UART frame, tracking the transmission, and initiating the process of transmission for the succeeding data byte.",

UART is a kind of serial communication protocol; it's tech integral to computers and it forms the backbone of main IO functions on most devices.\n\nIn the code, it takes a clock input (`ck`), which is used to control the baud rate (the frequency rate at which information is transferred). The 8-bit input `tx_data` is the data to be transferred via UART protocol. Three outputs are defined: `tx`, `ready`, and `baud`.\n\nThe `baud_counter` acts as a timer to control the baud rate. The frequency is calculated by counting up to 104 based on the clock input.\n\nA shift register mechanism is implemented here which manages the UART communication with a start bit, 8 data bits, and a stop bit.\n\nThe `tx` output corresponds to the least significant bit of the shift register, which is how serialized data output is conventionally implemented in UART communication.\n\nThe `ready` output signal signifies whether the module is ready to transmit the next byte of data. It remains high (ready) when the `count` equals to 0, which means that the transmission of one frame (start bit, 8 data bits, stop bit) has been completed.\n\nThe `baud` output relates to the baud rate signaling, and it turns high when count reaches half of the upper limit (in this case, 50)."

Its value incrementally increases (starts from 0 to 104) upon each falling edge of the clock input. When it reaches the maximum value, it is reset to zero. It's primarily used to control the rate of TX data transmission.\n  \n- `count`: This is a 4-bit wide signal that keeps track of the number of bits transmitted. It counts from 0 to 10, corresponding to the 1 start bit, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit of a UART frame. It increments by 1 when `baud_counter` reaches 0 and rest to 0 after 10.\n  \n- `shift`: This is a 10-bit wide signal, effectively serving as a shift register. It stores the data to be transmitted. Initially, `shift` is loaded with a frame composed of 1 start bit, the `tx_data` (8 bits), and 1 stop bit. Then it gets shifted right until all bits have been sent out, the next frame's data are then loaded into `shift` when `count` is zero. It holds the data to be transmitted when `count` is not zero."
