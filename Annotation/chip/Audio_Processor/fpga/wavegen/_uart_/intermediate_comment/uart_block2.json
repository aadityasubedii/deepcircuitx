    "block_comment": "This block of verilog code implements a shift operation, specifically for a process that sends serial data. At every negative edge of the clock (\"ck\"), if the baud rate counter (\"baud_counter\") is at zero, the code checks whether a counter variable (\"count\") is zero or 10. If it is zero, the shift register (\"shift\") is loaded with the transmission data (\"tx_data\") framed by two 1-bits. If \"count\" is not zero, the code shifts the contents of the \"shift\" register right by one bit. This effectively transmits one bit of the \"tx_data\" at each clock cycle. The \"count\" variable is either reset to 0 if it reaches 10, or incremented by 1, tracking each bit of the transmission data."
