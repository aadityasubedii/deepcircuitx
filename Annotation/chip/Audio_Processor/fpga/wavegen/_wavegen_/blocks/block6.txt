This block primarily generates signal values based on the frequency of a clock counter. The hardware implementation utilizes an always block triggered at the positive edge of ck clock. If 'en' is high and 'frame_posn' equals to zero, 'addr', 'frame', and 'pulse_period' will increment at every clock cycle. The block also incorporates a case statement which sets respective signals ('signal_0' to 'signal_3') based on the value of 'state' that alters the frequency of the sinusoidal signals. It also has a special case when 'state' equals to 3, it generates either two different constant patterns in the signals if 'pulse_period' is 0 or zeros otherwise.
