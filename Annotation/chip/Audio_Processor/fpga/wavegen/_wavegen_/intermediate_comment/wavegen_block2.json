    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code controls the operations of eight LED lights based on the value of the 'state' variable and 'counter' bit-vector. The block first assigns the output for four LED lights (LED0 to LED3) to four different states, turning the corresponding LED on when the 'state' value equals its associated number. Additionally, the output for the next four LEDs (LED4 to LED7) is managed by the four least significant bits of the 'counter' bit-vector. As a result, the value of the 'counter' directly controls these four LEDs."
