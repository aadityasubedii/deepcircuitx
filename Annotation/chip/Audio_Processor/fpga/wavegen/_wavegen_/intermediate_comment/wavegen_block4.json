    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of 'next' based on the condition of 'counter'. If the 'counter' value equals zero, 'next' is assigned a value of one; otherwise, 'next' is assigned a value of zero. This is done using a ternary operator, `(counter==0) ? 1:0`, which acts as a compact version of an if-else statement, thus providing a neat space-optimized implementation."
