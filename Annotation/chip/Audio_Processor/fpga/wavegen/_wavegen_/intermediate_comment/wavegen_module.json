    "module": "Module-level comment: Top module implements an I2S interface, generating and managing I2S signals using submodules like i2s_clock and i2s_tx. It operates on an input clock 'CLK', digital input signals 'D0' and 'D2', and a state control switch 'SW1'. The module uses key internal signals like 'ck', 'state', 'signal_0'-'signal_3', and 'counter' for operations. State management uses a case construct within an 'always' block to create different signal sequences based on a sine function. The state and counters are indicated through LED outputs."
