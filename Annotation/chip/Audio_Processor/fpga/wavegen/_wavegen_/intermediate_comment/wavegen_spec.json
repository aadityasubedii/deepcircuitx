    "spec": "Module name: top. \n\nModule specification: The 'top' module serves as a top-level design for an I2S (Inter-IC Sound) interface with provisions to generate and manage I2S signals. The module operates synchronously with the input system clock 'CLK'. It makes use of several submodules like i2s_clock and i2s_tx for I2S signal generation. The LED output ports indicate the processed state and counter outputs. It also handles a sine function to output different frequencies of signal sequences depending on its current state.\n\nInput ports for the module include a system clock 'CLK', digital input signals 'D0' and 'D2', and a switch input 'SW1'. The 'CLK' synchronizes all the sequential operations within the module, 'D0' and 'D2' carry digital input signals, and 'SW1' changes the state of the system.\n\nOutput ports include LEDs 'LED0' through 'LED7' each indicating specific state and counter information, digital output signals 'D1' through 'D6' for further processing or indication of internal operations, and digital output from the I2S transmitter modules 'D7'. \n\nCritical internal signals include the clock 'ck', the 21-bit register 'prescale' for clock division, 'debounce' signal for debouncing, 'i2s_sck_gen' and 'i2s_ws_gen' generated by the i2s_clock module, 'sck' and 'ws' representing clock signals for I2S, 'state' representing the frequency sequence generation state, 'signal_0' through 'signal_3' for storing the sin function values, 'pulse_period' for pulsing the signals, 'd0' and 'd1' for storing the serial data from the i2s_tx module, 'sw1' for storing the state of 'SW1', and 'counter' for keeping track of the cycles since last reset.\n\nThe code is organized into blocks each handling specific operations such as initializing and updating registers and wires, state and signal management, instances of submodules like 'i2s_clock' and 'i2s_tx', and conditional assignments for specific operations. The 'always' blocks are used for sequential logic implementation, and 'assign' statements are used to assign values to the wires and output ports.\n",

The module operates synchronously with the input system clock 'CLK'. It makes use of several submodules like i2s_clock and i2s_tx for I2S signal generation. The LED output ports indicate the processed state and counter outputs. It also handles a sine function to output different frequencies of signal sequences depending on its current state.\n\nInput ports for the module include a system clock 'CLK', digital input signals 'D0' and 'D2', and a switch input 'SW1'. The 'CLK' synchronizes all the sequential operations within the module, 'D0' and 'D2' carry digital input signals, and 'SW1' changes the state of the system.\n\nOutput ports include LEDs 'LED0' through 'LED7' each indicating specific state and counter information, digital output signals 'D1' through 'D6' for further processing or indication of internal operations, and digital output from the I2S transmitter modules 'D7'. \n\nCritical internal signals include the clock 'ck', the 21-bit register 'prescale' for clock division, 'debounce' signal for debouncing, 'i2s_sck_gen' and 'i2s_ws_gen' generated by the i2s_clock module, 'sck' and 'ws' representing clock signals for I2S, 'state' representing the frequency sequence generation state, 'signal_0' through 'signal_3' for storing the sin function values, 'pulse_period' for pulsing the signals, 'd0' and 'd1' for storing the serial data from the i2s_tx module, 'sw1' for storing the state of 'SW1', and 'counter' for keeping track of the cycles since last reset.\n\nThe code is organized into blocks each handling specific operations such as initializing and updating registers and wires, state and signal management, instances of submodules like 'i2s_clock' and 'i2s_tx', and conditional assignments for specific operations. The 'always' blocks are used for sequential logic implementation, and 'assign' statements are used to assign values to the wires and output ports.\n"
