Module name: lab4. Module specification: The lab4 module is the top-level module for an audio processing system that interfaces with an AC97 audio codec. It implements volume control, filter selection, and audio signal processing. The module takes inputs from buttons (vol_button_down, vol_button_up, filt_down, filt_up, step_button_down, step_button_up) and the AC97 codec (ac97_bit_clock, ac97_sdata_in), processes audio data, and outputs the processed audio (ac97_sdata_out) along with visual feedback on LEDs and a seven-segment display. Internal signals include reset, from_ac97_data, to_ac97_data, ready, volume, filtnum, and step, which are used for managing audio data flow, user input processing, and controlling various aspects of the audio processing system. The module consists of several
