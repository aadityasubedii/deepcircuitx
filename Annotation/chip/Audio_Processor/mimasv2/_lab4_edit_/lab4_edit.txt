Module-level comment: This module implements a top-level audio processing system interfacing with an AC97 codec. It processes audio data, applies filters, and controls volume based on user inputs. The module uses submodules for audio interface, filter control, and display. It handles button inputs for volume, filter selection, and step control, applies debouncing, and manages audio data flow between the AC97 codec and processing blocks. The processed audio is output along with visual feedback on LEDs and a seven-segment display.
