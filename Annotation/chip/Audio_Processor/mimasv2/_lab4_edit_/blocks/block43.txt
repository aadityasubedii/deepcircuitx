The FilterControlModule is a digital signal processing module in Verilog that applies filters to input data from an AC97 audio codec. This module works by receiving eight-bit input data 'from_ac97_data' from the AC97 codec, applies a filter determined by 'filtnum', and outputs processed data 'to_ac97_data' back to the AC97 codec. It also features a 'step' input that controls the level of filtering. The operations are carried out in a specific rhythm determined by the 'clock' input, and the module returns to its initial state when 'reset' is activated. The 'ready' input wire serves the function of signaling the module to begin processing.
