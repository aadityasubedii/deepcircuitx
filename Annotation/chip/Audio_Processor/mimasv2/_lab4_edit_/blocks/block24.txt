Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for incrementing the 'offset' by 1 whenever the system is ready and a rising edge of the clock signal occurs. This is achieved by using an 'always' block which gets triggered at the positive edge of the clock signal. Inside this block, it checks if the system is 'ready' through an if-condition. If the condition is met, the 'offset' gets updated by adding 1 (represented in 5-bit hexadecimal format '5'h1') to its current value.
