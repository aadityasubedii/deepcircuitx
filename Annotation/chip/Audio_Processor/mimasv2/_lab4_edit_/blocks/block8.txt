Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL directly assigns the value of `vol` as the result of the expression `31 - volume`. It essentially calculates the complement of the value contained within the variable `volume`, assuming that the maximum level for volume is set at `31`. This could be used to invert the volume control, where a higher `volume` value corresponds to a lower `vol` output level. The specific function of the block will depend on the larger context in which it is used.
