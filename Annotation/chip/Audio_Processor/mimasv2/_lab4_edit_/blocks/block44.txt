This block of code acts as a configuration unit for a 7 segment display. It performs the task of assigning two key parameters: the 'enable' signal and the value to be displayed. The value to be displayed is held in the 'bcd' array, indexed by variable 'filtnum'. It is then passed to 'SevenSegment' for display. Meanwhile, the general display functionality is controlled by the 'enable' signal, which when asserted, allows 'SevenSegment' to reflect the 'bcd' value.
