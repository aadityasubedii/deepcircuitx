This Verilog block is responsible for incrementing the `index` on every positive edge of the `clock`, conditioned to when the `ready` signal is high. The implementation leverages the use of sequential logic where, upon each clock cycle and when the `ready` signal is TRUE, the `index` is incremented by the `step` quantity.
