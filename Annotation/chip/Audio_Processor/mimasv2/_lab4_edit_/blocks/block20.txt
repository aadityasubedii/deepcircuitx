This block of code implements a shift register that synchronizes the AC 97 Codec 'ready' signal to the 100MHz clock domain. It's designed using a non-blocking assignment inside an always block which gets triggered at the positive edge of the 100 MHz clock signal. The 'ready_sync' array then takes the first and second bit of the previous 'ready_sync' state and appends the new 'ac97_ready' signal to it. This forms the new 'ready_sync' signal.
