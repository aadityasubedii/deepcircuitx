Comment: 
This block of code initializes the variables `index` and `pcm_data`. The `index` variable is set to hexadecimal 00, and the `pcm_data` which is a 20-bit wide variable is set to hexadecimal 00000 at the start of the simulation. The use of the non-blocking assignment (`<=`) ensures that all assignments occur simultaneously and reflect the state at the beginning of the current simulation timestep.
