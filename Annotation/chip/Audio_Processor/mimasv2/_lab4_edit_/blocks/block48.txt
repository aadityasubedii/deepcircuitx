Comment: 
This block is a filter number control mechanism that is triggered at the rising edge of a 100MHz clock. If reset is high, the filter number 'filtnum' is set to 0. Without reset, the block allows increasing or decreasing 'filtnum' by 1, based on the conditions of 'fup' and 'fdown' respectively, while 'fup' and 'fdown' are prevented from altering 'filtnum' at the same clock cycle as their prior enactment. The 'filtnum' signal is also constrained within the range of 0 to 15.
