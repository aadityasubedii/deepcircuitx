Comment: 
This block of code represents a memory module in a Verilog system. It's triggered at the rising edge of the clock (`posedge clk`). Memory is written to if the write enable signal is high (`if (we)`); the data (`din`) is stored at the address location (`addr`). Regardless of whether a write operation takes place, the contents of the memory at the given address (`addr`) is output (`dout <= mem[addr]`).
