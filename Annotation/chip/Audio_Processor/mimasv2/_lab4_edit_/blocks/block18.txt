This block of code covers the process of sending output audio data if the system is ready and capturing the high order bits of input audio data. Primarily, it utilizes a conditional statement inside an always block that is triggered at the rising edge of a 100 MHz clock. If a 'ready' signal is active, the block assigns the 'audio_out_data' to 'out_data'. Concurrently, The 'audio_in_data' is assigned the upper 8 bits of 'left_in_data' through bit slicing.
