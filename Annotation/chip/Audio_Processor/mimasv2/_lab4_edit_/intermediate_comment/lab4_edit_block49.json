    "block_comment": "This block is a volume control logic block in a Verilog design. The block is triggered at every positive edge of a 100MHz clock. If a 'reset' signal is active, it sets the 'volume' to 20. Otherwise, it checks for two conditions: a 'volume up' signal 'vup', which increases the 'volume' by one unless it's already at the maximum value of 31, and a 'volume down' signal 'vdown', which decreases 'volume' by one unless it's already at the minimum value of 0. The previous states of 'vup' and 'vdown' are kept track of in 'old_vup' and 'old_vdown' to detect changes in the respective inputs for the next clock cycle."
