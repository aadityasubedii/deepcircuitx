    "block_comment": "This block initializes variables and arrays at the start of operation. The variables 'index', 'accum' and 'output_reg' are set to 0, while 'sample' is an array of size 32 with all elements also initialized to 0. This setup ensures that operations with these variables and array start from a known and controlled state, facilitating proper execution of the subsequent hardware operations."
