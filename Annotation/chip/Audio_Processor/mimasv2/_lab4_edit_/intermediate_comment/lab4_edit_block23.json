    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter in Verilog. When a 'ready' signal is high at a clock edge, the data 'x' is sample buffered while reset occurrences take place for 'index', 'accum', and 'done'. The designed filter coefficients are then applied to the sample within the next condition, where the convolution operation occurs if 'ready' is low and 'index' is less than 30. In the subsequent block, the result is assigned to 'output_reg' and 'done' is set to 1 when 'index' is equal to 30, suggesting the end of the filter operation."
