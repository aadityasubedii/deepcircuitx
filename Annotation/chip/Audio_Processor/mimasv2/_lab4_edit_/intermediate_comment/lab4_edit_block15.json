    "block_comment": "The ac97 module is a digital interface for audio devices, facilitating sound data exchanges among hardware components. It receives addresses, data, validity signals, and audio information through its inputs, and simultaneously outputs corresponding left, right audio data and audio sync signals. The underlying logic leverages the intermediary 'command_valid', 'left_valid', and 'right_valid' wires to ensure correct processing and sychronization of sound data based on the system's bit clock."
