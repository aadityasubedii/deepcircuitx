    "block_comment": "This block of code handles audio data processing in a Digital Audio System. It scales down the incoming 20-bit \"left_in_data\" to an 8-bit \"audio_in_data\" by extracting the top 8 most significant bits and disregards the rest. Then, to meet the requirement of a 20-bit output, it concatenates a 12-bit zero ('000000000000') to the end of the 8-bit 'out_data' to form the 'left_out_data'. The operation concludes by setting 'right_out_data' to be equal to 'left_out_data'."
