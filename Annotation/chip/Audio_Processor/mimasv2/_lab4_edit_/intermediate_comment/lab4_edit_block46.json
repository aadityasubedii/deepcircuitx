    "block_comment": "The module, FilterDisplay, provides a mechanism to control a seven-segment display based on the filter number provided as an input. The `filtnum` input is a 4-bit binary number corresponding to the filter selection. The selected filter number is displayed on the seven-segment display - driven by the `SevenSegment` and `SevenSegmentEnable` outputs. The `enable` register is a 3-bit register that enables the display. An array of 8-bit registers, `bcd`, stores the BCD representation of numbers 0 to 15, serving as a reference to drive the display based on the filter selection."
