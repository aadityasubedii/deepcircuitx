    "block_comment": "This block of code is a functional mapping unit in Verilog that determines the value of delay based on the value of an index. The assignment of delay is based on a 4-bit wide index. When a particular value of the index is chosen, the case statement corresponding to that index value is executed updating delay accordingly. For index values from 0 to 3, unique delay values are assigned whereas for index values from 4 to 15, the delay is assigned a constant value of 1. In the default case, which is executed when none of the explicit conditions are met, delay is again assigned a value of 1."
