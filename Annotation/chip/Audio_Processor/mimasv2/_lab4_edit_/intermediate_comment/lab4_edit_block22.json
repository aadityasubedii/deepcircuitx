    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the module `lab4audio` for audio processing in Verilog. This audio processing module is designed to interface with AC'97 codec, with its clock (CLK_100MHz), reset, volume control (volume), audio input data (audio_in_data), audio output data (audio_out_data), status of readiness (ready), audio reset control (audio_reset_b), AC'97 serial data output (ac97_sdata_out), AC'97 serial data input (ac97_sdata_in), AC'97 synchronization signal (ac97_synch), and AC'97 bit clock (ac97_bit_clock) signals defined as inputs and outputs. It seems designed to handle audio data inputs and outputs, as well as synchronization and volume control of AC'97 audio codec."
