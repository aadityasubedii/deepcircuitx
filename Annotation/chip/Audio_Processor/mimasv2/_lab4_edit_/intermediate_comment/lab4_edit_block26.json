    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a 31-point Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter module. It takes in a signed 8-bit input \"x\" and generates a signed 18-bit output \"y\", controlled by clock, reset, and ready signals, and filter number specified. Internally, the filter uses a 5-bit index, a 5-bit offset, and an array to hold 32 samples of the input, where each sample is an 8-bit signed value. The filter accumulates the results in a 18-bit signed accumulator. The filter also uses a 10-bit signed coefficient providing weights for the different inputs. The computed result is assigned to the output register, which is then connected to the output wire \"y\"."
