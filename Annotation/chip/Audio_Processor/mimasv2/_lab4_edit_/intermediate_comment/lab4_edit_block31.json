    "block_comment": "The block of code is a decision structure which sets a coefficient value (coeff) based on the selected index. This is implemented using nested always block case statements, where values of 'select' and 'index' are decoded and assigned to 'coeff' accordingly. Initially, 'select' is decoded where inputs ranging from 4'd1 to 4'd3 are identified and the default: coeff is set to neutral (10'h0). For each case of 'select', 'index' is further decoded in the same manner (5'd0 to 5'd30) assigning corresponding coefficient value to 'coeff' in each case."
