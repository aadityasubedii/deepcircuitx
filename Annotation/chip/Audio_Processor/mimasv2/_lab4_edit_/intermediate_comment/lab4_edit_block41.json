    "block_comment": "This block of code performs multiplication operation on variables 'x' and 'y'. The multiplication is executed when the 'ready' signal is HIGH, and the result is saved in the variable 'prod' at every positive edge of the clock. This ensures that the product is only updated when required, based on the value of 'ready', and synchronously with the system clock cycle."
