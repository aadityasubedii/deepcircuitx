    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code signifies a synchronous resettable up/down counter with a step size. The process gets triggered at the positive edge of a 100MHz clock. If the `reset` signal is active, the `step` value gets set to `0400`. Otherwise, when an `up` request appears (`sup` signal), and it wasn't there in the previous clock cycle (`~old_sup`), and the counter is not at its maximum (`step` is not `FFFF`), `step` gets increased by `0F`. Similarly, when a `down` request appears (`sdown` signal), and it wasn't there in the previous clock cycle (`~old_sdown`), and the counter is not at its minimum (`step` is not `0`), `step` gets decreased by `0F`. The old values of the `sup` and `sdown` signals are updated at the end of each clock cycle to be used for comparison in the next one."
