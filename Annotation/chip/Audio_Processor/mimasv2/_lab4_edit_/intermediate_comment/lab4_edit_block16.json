    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code accomplishes data transfer. It effectively assigns the value of 'left_out_data' to 'right_out_data', implying that the data present on 'left_out_data' is passed onto 'right_out_data'. This is achieved using the assign statement of Verilog, which is used for continuous assignment. The implementation doesn't involve any conditional logic, thereby ensuring seamless data flow from 'left_out_data' to 'right_out_data'."
