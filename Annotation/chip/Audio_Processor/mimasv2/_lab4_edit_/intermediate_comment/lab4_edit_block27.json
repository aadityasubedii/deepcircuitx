    "block_comment": "This block is a noise filtering function in Verilog. It specifically uses a digital delay filter to remove noise from a signal. When a reset signal is high or a new noisy signal different from the present one comes, the count is reset to 0 and the present new noisy signal is accepted. Otherwise, it increments the count at every positive edge of the clock signal. If the count reaches a predefined threshold (270000, in this case), the new signal is considered as a clean signal."
