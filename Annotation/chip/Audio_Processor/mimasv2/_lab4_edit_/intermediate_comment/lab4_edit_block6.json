    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a module `DelayModule` for a delay system. Inputs into the module include a clock signal, a reset signal, a ready signal, an 8-bit signed integer `x`, and a 4-bit filter number `filtnum`, while it only produces a single 18-bit signed integer output `y`. The delay is implemented using the signed integers and filter number which is decided by `filtnum`. The `ready` signal indicates when `x` inputs are ready to be processed. If `reset` signal is asserted, it resets the current state of the delay. The entire operation is synchronized with the provided `clock`."
