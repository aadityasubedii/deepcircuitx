    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a module `coeffs31` which returns a specific coefficient based on a specified index and selection mode. The module expects two inputs including a four-bit 'select' and a five-bit 'index', and produces a ten-bit signed output defined as 'coeff'. The 'select' input wire is used to specify a particular selection mode from multiple predefined modes. Meanwhile, the 'index' input wire is utilised to specify the desired index of the coefficient in the selected mode. These are then used in conjunction to output the appropriate coefficient."
