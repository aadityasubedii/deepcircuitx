    "block_comment": "The block of code works with synchronizing audio data in the AC97 data format. Specifically, this block reads the left and right audio data streams being transmitted every negative edge of the bit clock. Going into implementation specifics, the block reads 20-bit words from 'ac97_sdata_in', organizing the left channel data when the bit count is between 57 and 76, and the right channel data when the bit count is between 77 and 96."
