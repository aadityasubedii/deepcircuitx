    "block_comment": "This block implements a state machine that generates different command signals, with each state corresponding to a specific command assignment. In every clock cycle, if the 'ready' signal is asserted, next state is obtained by incrementing the current state by 1. Different commands are then assigned to the 'command' signal as per the state. For instance, when the state is '0', 'command' is assigned a value of '80_0000' and 'command_valid' is asserted to '1'. When state is '3', the command is a concatenation of different signals. If none of the defined states is selected, the command takes the default value of '24'h80_0000'."
