    "block_comment": "This module implements a debounce functionality, specifically designed to mitigate the impact of any false signal transitions, noise, that might be incoming. This is achieved by integrating a 19-bit wide \"count\" register to track timing of noisy signals and a \"new\" register to store the 'debounced' signal. The signal is finally output as 'clean' after it's appropriately debounced. The module operates based on the system clock and can be reset."
