    "block_comment": "This block implements a ready signal generation using a synchronous ready signal and inversion of the third stage of the ready signal. It performs an AND operation between the second stage of a synchronized ready signal (`ready_sync[1]`) and the inverted third stage of the same signal (`~ready_sync[2]`) to generate the final `ready` signal. The purpose of this block is to ensure the ready signal is properly synchronized and aligned with the expected timing boundaries."
