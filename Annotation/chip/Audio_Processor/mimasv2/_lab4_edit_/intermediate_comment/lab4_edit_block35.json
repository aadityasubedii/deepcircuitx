    "block_comment": "This block assigns values to the 'pcm_data' variable based on the different conditions of 'index', making it function as a lookup table. The highest 6 bits of the 'index' variable are used as the case select value. Depending on the case value, 'pcm_data' is assigned specific hexadecimal values. For example, when 'index' is 'h00', 'pcm_data' is assigned 'h00000' and when 'index' is 'h01', 'pcm_data' is assigned 'h0C8BD' and so on. This block is typically used in designs requiring quick lookup for different values of 'index'.\n"
