It interfaces with an AC97 audio codec, implements volume control, filter selection, and audio signal processing. The module includes various submodules for different functions:\n\n1. Audio interface (lab4audio) for communicating with the AC97 codec\n2. Filter control (FilterControlModule) for applying different audio filters\n3. Volume control using buttons\n4. Filter selection using buttons\n5. Step control for adjusting some parameters\n6. Seven-segment display for showing the current filter\n7. Debouncing for button inputs\n\nThe module takes input from buttons, processes audio data, and outputs the processed audio along with visual feedback on LEDs and a seven-segment display. It allows for real-time adjustment of volume, filter selection, and other audio processing parameters."
