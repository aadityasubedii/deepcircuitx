The Mimas V2 repository is designed for sophisticated audio processing interfaced with an AC97 codec, focusing on functionalities such as volume control, audio filtering, and user input handling. It encompasses a top-level module which orchestrates the overall operation by integrating submodules responsible for audio interfacing, filter management, and user interfacing via buttons. Crucial features include debouncing button inputs to prevent errors, managing the flow of audio data across the processing blocks and the AC97 codec, and providing user feedback through visual indicators like LEDs and a seven-segment display. This repository encapsulates a comprehensive system for manipulating and outputting audio data, controlled through user inputs and displayed efficiently on hardware outputs.
