The repository named Asic-Based-Mini-Stereo-Audio-Digital-Processor hosts a sophisticated module designed to manage a digital signal processing system specifically for stereo audio processing. It effectively implements a complex state machine that oversees the coordination of input and output operations along with memory and ALU operations tailored for the left and right audio channels. The implementation involves utilizing multiple always blocks which are essential for managing state transitions, generating control signals, and handling memory pointers based on the moduleâ€™s input signals and its internal state. Additionally, this module is responsible for orchestrating the flow of data across various system components such as input buffers, memory units, and the ALU, ensuring synchronized processing between the two audio channels. This system is crucial for achieving high-quality digital audio processing in stereo formats, streamlining the handling of audio signals with precision and efficiency.
