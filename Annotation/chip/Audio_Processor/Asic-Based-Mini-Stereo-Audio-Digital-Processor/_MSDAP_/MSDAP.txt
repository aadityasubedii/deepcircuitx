Module-level comment: This controller module manages a digital signal processing system for stereo audio processing. It implements a complex state machine to coordinate input/output operations, memory access, and ALU operations for left and right channels. The module uses multiple always blocks to handle state transitions, control signal generation, and memory pointer management based on input signals and internal states. It orchestrates the flow of data through various system components, including input buffers, memory units, and ALU, while maintaining synchronization between left and right channels.
