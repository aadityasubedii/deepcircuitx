    "block_comment": "The block of code in Verilog RTL is an always block, which gets triggered at positive edges of a system clock (sClk), negative edges of a reset signal or positive edges of start or done_L signals. Inside the block, there are several states controlled by conditional checking. This block's function is to control the flow and storage state in the hardware design, including settings for reset, start, and the done_L flag. Conditional checking is implemented on reset, start, and done_L. If reset is active, then it sets the state to state7, deactivates the ready input (inReady), and clears a numeric variable (n). If the start is active, it initializes all control signals and storage pointers, and if done_L is active, it disables various enable signals. For other cases, it proceeds as per the next state decided by a cascaded conditional structure (case-endcase), where each state manipulates several signals and pointers. Also, each state carries out different tasks. For instance, state0 prepares the hardware for initializing with new input data, state1 and state3 reset different parts of the system, etc. The progression of states is controlled by readiness checks (like 'if(w_Ready)') and comparisons involving different hardware flags and pointers such as rw_Ptr_L, hw_Ptr_L, etc."
