Module name: controller. Module specification: The controller module is a complex state machine that manages the operation of a digital signal processing system. It handles input/output operations, memory access, and ALU operations for left and right channels, likely in a stereo audio processing application. The module has inputs for reset, start, clock, data ready signals, and completion flags, and outputs for various control signals and memory pointers. Key inputs include reset, start, sClk, w_Ready, word_Sent, frame, done_L, done_R, sleep, and prev_OutReady. Important outputs are frame_Edg, inReady, outReady, ALU_En, serial_Output_En, and various enable, reset, and pointer signals for different memory components. Internal signals include state registers, pointer buffers, and clear/stop flags for managing the state machine and memory operations. The module is organized into several always blocks that
