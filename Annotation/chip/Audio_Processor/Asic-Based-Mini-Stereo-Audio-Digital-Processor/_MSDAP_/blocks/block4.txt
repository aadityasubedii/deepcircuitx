Comment: 
This block represents a finite-state machine (FSM) for managing a frame-based processing system by performing operations such as ALU operations or serial output as per the current state. The system starts initially in the idle state (state0). Depending on different conditions like frame, w_Ready, etc. it transitions between different states. When a reset signal or a start signal is received it forces the system back to an initial or idle state. In certain states, it enables serial output or ALU based on conditions such as frame, prev_OutReady, and w_Ready. It maintains the current state until a specific event occurs to change to the next state. FSM default condition resets all output variables to '0'.
