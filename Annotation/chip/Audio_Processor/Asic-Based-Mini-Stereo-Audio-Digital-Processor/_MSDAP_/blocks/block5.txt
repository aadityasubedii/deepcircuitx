Comment: 
The Verilog code represents an always block with various conditional states, reacting to the positive edges of 'start', 'done_L' signals, and negative edge of 'reset'. The purpose of the block is to control the behavior of three variables 'rw_Ptr_Buff_L', 'xw_Ptr_Buff_L', and 'hw_Ptr_Buff_L'. The block resets the above-mentioned three variables and controls two stop flags under a reset or start signal. In the absence of either, the next state is chosen through a case construct, where each state represents different behaviors modeled by these variables. These behaviors can be incrementing the variable values, resetting them, or setting them based on conditions like 'sleep' or whether they have reached certain limits. Some state outcomes also involve manipulating the state of the two stop flags 'r_Clr_Stop_L' and 'x_Clr_Stop_L'.
