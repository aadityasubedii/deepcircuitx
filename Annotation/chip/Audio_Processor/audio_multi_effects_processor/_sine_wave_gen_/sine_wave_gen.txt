Module-level comment: This 'sine_wave_gen' module generates a standard sine wave, digitally approximated by cycling through an array of pre-calculated sine values. It operates sequentially using a clock signal 'clk', which on every positive edge, increments the array index 'i' and outputs the corresponding sine value through 'data_out' port. A continuous wave form is ensured by resetting 'i' to zero after reaching the array's end, thus facilitating the onset of a new wave cycle.
