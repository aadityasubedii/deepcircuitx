The 'sine' array is initialized with pre-calculated sine values ranging from 0 to 29. For every rising edge of the input clock signal, the 'sine' value at index 'i' is directed to 'data_out' and 'i' is incremented. Once 'i' reaches the end of the array (i.e., i == 29), 'i' is reset back to 0. Consequently, 'data_out' repeatedly cycles through the sine array values, thereby generating a continuous digital approximation of a sine wave."
