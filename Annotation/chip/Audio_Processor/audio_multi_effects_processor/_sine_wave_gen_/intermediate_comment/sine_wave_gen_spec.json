    "spec": "Module name: sine_wave_gen. \n\nModule specification: The sine_wave_gen module is designed to generate a standard sine wave using a pre-calculated array of values, acting as a digital approximation of the wave. The module uses a single input port, clk, which functions as the rhythm setter for signal procession through the array elements. On every positive edge of clk, the sine value at the current index 'i' is directed to the output port, data_out, thus producing the sine wave. \n\nThe module utilizes an array named 'sine' holding 30 pre-calculated 12-bit sine values ranging from 0 to 29, an integer index 'i' for the array, and an internal 12-bit register 'data_out'. The sine array spells out the approximated sine wave shape. The index 'i' increments on every clk signal's positive edge and resets back to 0 after reaching 29 to provide a continuous waveform. The data_out register is directly linked to the module's output port and holds the current sine value for output. \n\nThe code is primarily divided into initialization and clock-dependent blocks. During initialization, integer 'i' is zeroed out, and the sine array is defined with pre-calculated values. In the clock-dependent block, driven by positive clk edge, the current 'sine' value is directed to data_out and 'i' incremented, supporting cyclic waveform generation.\n",
