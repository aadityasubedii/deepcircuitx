    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a sine wave output. At each positive edge of the clock signal, it selects the next sample point from a lookup table, 'sine', using the counter 'i' as an index. Then, 'i' is incremented by 1 to set up for the next clock cycle. If 'i' reaches the end of the lookup table at 29, it is reset to 0 to begin the sine wave generation again from the start."
