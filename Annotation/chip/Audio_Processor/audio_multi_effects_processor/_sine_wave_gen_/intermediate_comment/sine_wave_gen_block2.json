    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block initializes an implementation of a sine wave table with a 30-point precision. It pre-computes the pre-determined value of each point in the sine wave in a list, with the help of an 'initial' block which only runs once at the start of the simulation. The values range from '0' to '77' to '-77' to '0' and back to '-16', creating a traditional sine wave form, with 30 distinct values each representing a point in the sine wave."
