Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages a counter `i` with count up and count down capabilities. During each positive edge of the clock signal, depending on the value of `rlrot`, the block either increments or decrements the counter `i`. When `rlrot` is "11", the counter `i` increments until it reaching a preset maximum limit of 25. Similarly, when `rlrot` is "10", the block decreases the `i` value until it reaches a minimum limit of 0.
