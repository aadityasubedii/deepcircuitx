Comment: 
This block is responsible for generating an output data signal (`DATA_OUT`) based on the data input signal (`DATA_IN`) and a delay signal selected based on the index `i`. It continuously monitors changes in `DATA_IN` or `i` and on any change, updates `DATA_OUT` by adding the `DATA_IN` to the delay element fetched from the `DELAY` array as per the index `i`.
