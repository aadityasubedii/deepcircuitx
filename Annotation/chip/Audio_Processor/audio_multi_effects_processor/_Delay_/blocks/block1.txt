Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code performs a series of shifts in a delay line (pipeline) of 26 stages. The flow is implemented on the rising edge of the clock (clk), the input data (DATA_IN) is moved to the first stage of the pipeline (DELAY[0]), and the data in each stage is subsequently moved to the next stage (eg., DELAY[0] to DELAY[1], DELAY[1] to DELAY[2]), and so on till DELAY[24] to DELAY[25]. Hence, each clock tick shifts the data along the delay line.
