The delay is accomplished by an array of registers (DELAY) that sequentially holds each incoming input value (DATA_IN) on every rising edge of the clock (clk). The amount of delay depends on the value of 'i' which can be incremented or decremented by setting control input 'rlrot'. The final output is the sum of current input data and the data from the delay register indexed by 'i'."
