    "module": "Module-level comment: The Delay module, controlled by a clock signal ('clk') and a control input ('rlrot'), works on 12-bit input data ('DATA_IN') to introduce adjustable delay. The delay occurs via a 26-register shift array ('DELAY'), indexed by 'i'. 'rlrot' controls the increment or decrement of 'i', thus adjusting the delay level. On every clock edge, the array shifts, accepting new 'DATA_IN' and aging old data. Simultaneously, 'DATA_OUT' calculates as the addition of the current 'DATA_IN' and the 'DELAY' indexed data from the past cycle."
