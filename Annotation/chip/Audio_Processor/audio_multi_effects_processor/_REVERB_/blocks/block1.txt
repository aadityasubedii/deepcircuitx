This block is designed to implement a 41-stage shift register. It captures the incoming data at every rising edge of the clock and shifts it through the 41 stages, thus the data received in the current cycle will be available at IN[40] after 40 clock cycles. The incoming data is stored in IN[0], and at each clock cycle, the value of each register IN[i] is moved to the next register IN[i+1]. This method allows the propagation of data from one end of the register to the other in a sequential and time-ordered manner.
