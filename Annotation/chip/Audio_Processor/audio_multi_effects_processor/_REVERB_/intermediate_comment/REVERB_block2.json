    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code takes an input signal, called DATA_IN, and applies a specific transformation to it to produce an output signal, called DATA_OUT. The transformation includes an arithmetic computation, where selected bits (8th, 16th, 24th, 32nd, and 40th bit) of the INPUT array are right shifted by 2 and 1 positions and then added up. Specifically, the right shift operation by two places to these bits and additionally by one place is akin to diving by 4 and 2 respectively. The summed results are added onto the initial DATA_IN value and then signal this as DATA_OUT. All of these operations are triggered on any change to DATA_IN."
