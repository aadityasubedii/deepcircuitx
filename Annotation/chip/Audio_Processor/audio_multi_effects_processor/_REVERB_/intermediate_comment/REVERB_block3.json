    "block_comment": "This block initializes a set of data lines and an output line each to zero at the start of the simulation. The code achieves this by assigning the 12-bit binary value '000000000000' to each of the 41 lines, which includes 'DATA_OUT' and 40 data input lines 'IN' ranging from 0 to 40."
