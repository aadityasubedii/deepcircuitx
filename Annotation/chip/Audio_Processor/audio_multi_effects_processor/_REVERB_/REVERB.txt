Module-level comment: The REVERB module, working as a digital audio signal processor, implements a reverb effect. Using two inputs, clk and DATA_IN, it drives a shift register IN[], shifting the current data every clk cycle and adding DATA_IN at index 0. The output, DATA_OUT, is computed by summing DATA_IN and partially processed elements of IN[]. Module operation is primarily divided into initialization and shift/computation blocks, dictated by clk and DATA_IN respectively.
