Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code acts as a shift register. Upon each positive edge of the clock signal, the data at the input (DATA_IN) is loaded into the first register (IN[0]), while the existing data in each of the registers from IN[0] through IN[39] is sequentially shifted over to the next. The implementation is a series of non-blocking assignments, ensuring synchronicity with the rising edge of the clock.
