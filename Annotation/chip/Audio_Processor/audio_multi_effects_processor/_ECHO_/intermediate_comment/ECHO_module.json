    "module": "Module-level comment: The ECHO module produces an echo effect by outputting the input data, along with scaled versions (divided by 2 and 4) of an input from 40 clock cycles ago. The module uses a shift register array IN[40:0] to keep track of the past inputs. With every clock cycle, the data in this array is shifted and the current input data is added at IN[0]. The output data (DATA_OUT) is computed as the sum of input data (DATA_IN) and scaled down versions of IN[40]. Hence, in essence, this module provides a digital implementation of a reverb/delay effect commonly found in sound processing."
