    "block_comment": "This block initializes the variables 'DATA_OUT' and array 'IN' with zeroes in a digital system. It achieves this function by setting each index of the 'IN' array and 'DATA_OUT' to a 12-bit binary zero ('12'b000000000000') within an initial begin-end Verilog block, ensuring they are reset at the simulation start."
