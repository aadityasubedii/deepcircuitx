    "block_comment": "The block of code performs an arithmetic operation and delivers an output. Its function is to add an input DATA_IN with a 2-bit right-shifted version and a 1-bit right-shifted version of the 40th bit of the input vector IN, and then assign the result to DATA_OUT. The block dynamically updates DATA_OUT when there is a change in DATA_IN, accomplished using an always block, which monitors changes in the condition specified in the parentheses."
