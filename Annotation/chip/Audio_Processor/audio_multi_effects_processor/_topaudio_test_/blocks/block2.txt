This block of code is responsible for initializing and generating a clock signal. The initial state of both the clock signal and the 'miso' signal is set to 0. After waiting for 100 units of simulation time, a loop is entered where the clock signal toggles between 0 and 1 every 50 units of simulation time for a total of 2500*10**3 iterations, effectively generating a square wave signal with a period of 100 simulation-time units.
