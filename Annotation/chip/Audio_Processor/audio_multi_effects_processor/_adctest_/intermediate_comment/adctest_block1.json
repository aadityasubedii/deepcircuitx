    "block_comment": "This block initializes and controls the generation of a clock signal and a miso signal. The initial keyword starts the block, which sets the clock and clockenable signals to 0. The miso signal is also initialized to 0, but is toggled back and forth between 0 and 1 in each iteration of a loop, which repeats 700 times. After each miso signal toggle, there's a delay of 100 time units, effectively generating a square wave at a frequency determined by this delay."
