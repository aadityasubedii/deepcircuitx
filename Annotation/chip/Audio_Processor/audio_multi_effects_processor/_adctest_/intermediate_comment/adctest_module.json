    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'adctest' module conducts tests on an adc (analog-to-digital converter) instance using several internal signals. Inputs 'clock', 'clockenable', and 'miso' drive operations synchronization, clock control, and data flow, respectively. Outputs include 'adconv' flagging ADC conversion completion, 'datos' storing output data, 'ready' denoting adc module readiness, and 'sck' being SPI clock line. The 'bloque', and 'datostemp' are used as miscellaneous signals. The module utilizes three initial blocks that set parameters to 0, then periodically vary, testing the adc under different conditions."
