    "block_comment": "The given block of code functions as a test bench for testing the operation of a clock signal and a clock enable signal in a synchronous digital system, with an added miso signal maintained at logic 0. This functionality is achieved using an initial Verilog block to set the initial values of the clock, clock enable and miso signals. Then, a delay of 50 time units is imposed before entering a repeat loop. The repeat loop inverts the clock enable signal every 3500 time units, which simulates the rising and falling edges of a clock signal but for the clock enable. The loop repeats 10 times to simulate 10 cycles of clock enable change."
