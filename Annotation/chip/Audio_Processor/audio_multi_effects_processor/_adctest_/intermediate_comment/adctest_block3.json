    "block_comment": "The block of code serves as the initial clock and clock-enable controller for a digital circuit. In the implementation, initial values of clock, clockenable, and miso variables are set to zero, after which a delay of 100 time-units is introduced. Following this, the clock value is toggled after a delay of 50 time-units, repeating the process 700 times to emulate synchronous behavior of the circuit in a simulated environment."
