    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a frequency divider. It operates by incrementing a counter 'counter' every positive edge of the input clock 'clk'. When the 'counter' exceeds a certain value 'DIVISOR', it resets 'counter' back to zero. To generate the divided clock 'clk_out', it checks if the 'counter' is less than half of 'DIVISOR', if so, 'clk_out' is set to 1 otherwise 0."
