It uses an input clock signal (clk) and an internal counter to generate an output clock (clk_out) at a frequency lower than the input. The division factor is controlled by the DIVISOR parameter.

The counter is used to track the number of clock cycles and compare it against a specified divisor (DIVISOR). When the counter value equals or exceeds the DIVISOR, the counter resets to zero.
