Module name: fredivider. Module specification: The fredivider module in Verilog serves as a frequency divider. It uses a 28-bit internal register named 'counter' and an input clock signal 'clk'. Every positive edge of the 'clk' signal increments the counter by 1. The module compares this counter value with a specified divisor (DIVISOR parameter), which is set to 2. The frequency divider comes into action when the counter value exceeds or matches the DIVISOR, thereby resetting the counter to zero. Another critical function carried out by the counter is the control of the output clock signal ('clk_out') based on its most significant bit (MSB). If the counter value is less than half the value of the DIVISOR, a high-level signal '1' is assigned to 'clk_out', otherwise, it is assigned a low-level signal '0'. As a result, 'clk_out' operates at a frequency lower than the input clock signal, with the output frequency being half of the input frequency in this particular case.
