The block functions as a state machine that manipulates outputs 'enablegain', 'enableadc', and 'enabledac' based on the value of 'contador'. On each negative edge of the clock, it increments 'contador' until it reaches 78, at which point it resets 'contador' to 10. Throughout, it selectively enables 'enablegain', 'enableadc', and 'enabledac'. Until 'contador' reaches 10, 'enablegain' is set high. When 'contador' is between 10 and 45, 'enablegain' is set low and 'enableadc' is set high, while 'enabledac' is deactivated. From 45 to 78, 'enableadc' is deactivated and 'enabledac' is activated. Upon reaching 78, the cycle resets.
