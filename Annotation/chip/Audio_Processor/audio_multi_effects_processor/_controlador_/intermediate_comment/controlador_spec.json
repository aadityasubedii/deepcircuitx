A unique function of this module is the sequential enabling of these units based on the count of a local counter, 'contador'. Inputs to this module consist of a 'clock' signal which provides the reference timescale of operations being performed. Outputs from this module are 'enablegain', 'enableadc', 'enabledac', 'spissb', 'sf_ce0', 'fpgainitb' signals, most of which serve to activate or deactivate the external units previously mentioned. The 'spissb', 'sf_ce0', 'fpgainitb' signals are initialized but remain unmodified in this module. The 'contador' is an internal 7-bit register used as a counter to decide when the enable signals should be activated or deactivated based on the clock signal falling edge. The main blocks of code include an 'initial' block which initializes the signals and an 'always' block which is responsible for the sequential functionality of the module.",

It provides enable signals to these units sequentially, based on the clock cycles counted by a local counter- 'contador'. In initial 10 cycles only 'enablegain' is set high, in next 35 cycles 'enableadc' is set high, and for the following 33 cycles 'enabledac' is set high. After 78 cycles, the counter resets to 10 and the cycle repeats. There are three outputs 'spissb', 'sf_ce0', 'fpgainitb' that are initialized but not used in the code.
