    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes the system states at the beginning of simulation or system reset. It sets counter 'contador' to 0 and disables gain (enablegain), ADC (enableadc), and DAC (enabledac) by setting them to 0. It also sets SPI Slave Select (spissb) and Chip Enable (sf_ce0) signals to high, indicating that no slave is selected and no chip is currently enabled. Finally, FPGA initialization (fpgainitb) is set to be inactive (low) at the start."
