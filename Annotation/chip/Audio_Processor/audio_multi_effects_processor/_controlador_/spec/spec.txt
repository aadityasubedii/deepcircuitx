Module name: controlador.

Module specification: The 'controlador' module is a versatile unit designed specifically for managing the operations of external units which include a gain unit, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and a digital-to-analog convertor (DAC). A unique function of this module is the sequential enabling of these units based on the count of a local counter, 'contador'. Inputs to this module consist of a 'clock' signal which provides the reference timescale of operations being performed. Outputs from this module are 'enablegain', 'enableadc', 'enabledac', 'spissb', 'sf_ce0', 'fpgainitb' signals, most of which serve to activate or deactivate the external units previously mentioned. The 'spissb', 'sf_ce0', 'fpgainitb' signals are initialized but remain unmodified in this module. The 'contador' is an internal 7-bit register used as a counter to decide when the enable signals should be activated or deactivated based on the clock signal falling edge. The main blocks of code include an 'initial' block which initializes the signals and an 'always' block which is responsible for the sequential functionality of the module.
