Comment: 
This block of code is a multiplexer that selects an audio effect based on the states of various switches. On each rising edge of the clock signal, the 'effect_out' signal is assigned values from different sources depending on the condition of switches: DIS, DELAY, ECHO, REVERB. If multiple effects are activated, the code prioritizes DIS over DELAY. In the absence of any selected effects, 'effect_out' is assigned a clean input signal.
