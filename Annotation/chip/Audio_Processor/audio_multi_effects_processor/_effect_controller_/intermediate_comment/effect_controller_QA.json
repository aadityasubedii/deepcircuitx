It receives five types of effects signals (DIS, DELAY, ECHO, REVERB, CLEAN) and four switching signals (switch_DIS, switch_DELAY, switch_ECHO, switch_REVERB) as inputs. When the clock signal 'clk' has a positive edge, the module checks which effect switch is turned on and then assigns the corresponding input effect to the output 'effect_out'. If more than one switch is turned on, it gives preferential treatment according to their order defined in the code, with DIS getting the highest priority and REVERB getting the lowest. If none of the switches is turned on, it assigns the 'CLEAN' input to the output."

On a positive edge trigger, it checks the given conditions and based on those conditions, assigns the data to the output port.\n\n2. switch_DIS, switch_DELAY, switch_ECHO, switch_REVERB: These are the toggle switches. They determine which input signal has to be assigned to the output port.\n\n3. in_DIS, in_DELAY, in_ECHO, in_REVERB, in_CLEAN: These are the input signals.

The module assigns input signal to the output port based on the status of the switch and clock signal.\n\nExplanation: \n\nInput ports in this module are used to control which output effect is desired (DIS, DELAY, ECHO, REVERB or CLEAN). These effects are controlled by 4 switches that are treated as binary inputs. Based on the input and switch states at the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk', the corresponding effect is output to 'effect_out'. The 'effect_out' is the output signal that will carry this selected effect."
