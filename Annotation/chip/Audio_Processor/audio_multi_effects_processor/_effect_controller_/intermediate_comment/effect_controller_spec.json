    "spec": "Module name: effect_controller. \nModule specification: The module named 'effect_controller' is designed to control output effects based on input signals and four switches. The functionality revolves around five types of input effect signals (in_DIS, in_DELAY, in_ECHO, in_REVERB, in_CLEAN) and four switching signals (switch_DIS, switch_DELAY, switch_ECHO, switch_REVERB). The output of the module is manipulated and controlled by the clock signal 'clk'. At every positive edge of the clock, the module conducts a condition check and depending on the state of the switch signals, it assigns the corresponding input effect to 'effect_out'. If more than one switch is toggled on, the decision is made based on an order of priority defined in the code, with 'switch_DIS' being the highest and 'switch_REVERB' the lowest. If none of the switches are toggled on, 'in_CLEAN' effect is assigned to the output. Its input ports include 'clk', 'switch_DIS', 'switch_DELAY', 'switch_ECHO', 'switch_REVERB', 'in_DIS', 'in_DELAY', 'in_ECHO', 'in_REVERB', 'in_CLEAN'. The only output port is 'effect_out'. The module contains no internal signals as all signal interactions take place through either input or output ports directly. Different sections in the code include the module interface definition, input and output definitions, and the conditional checking and assigning block encapsulated within the 'always' block. Its entire operation is governed by this singular block that runs at every positive edge of the 'clk'.",
