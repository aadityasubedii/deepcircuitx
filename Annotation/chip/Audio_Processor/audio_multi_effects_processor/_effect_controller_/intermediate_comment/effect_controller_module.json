    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'effect_controller' module selects and controls output effects governed by input signals and status of four switches. Operates synchronously with a clock signal, it assigns input effect to 'effect_out' on the rising edge based on the switch state. Priority is 'DIS' > 'DELAY' > 'ECHO' > 'REVERB'. If no switches are on, outputs 'CLEAN' effect. Module's interface includes input clock, switches, effects and output 'effect_out'. There are no internal signals."
