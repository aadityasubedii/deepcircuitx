    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the output value of `mosi` based on the current `bloque` state by latching the values on the falling edge of the `clock`. If the value of `bloque` is neither 0 nor 9, `mosi` is assigned the value at the index `bloque-1` in the `gain` array, otherwise, `mosi` is set to 0. This block essentially operates as a state machine that loads values from the `gain` array or resets the `mosi` based on the value of `bloque` at each clock's negative edge."
