    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe 'ganancia' module facilitates digital amplified gain control through an SPI interface. It uses an input clock and 'clockenable' signal to control the operation. Internally, it utilizes the signals 'bloque' as a state register, 'gain' for amplification values, and 'estadosck' for SPI clock control. The process is divided into initialization and active states, guided by 'bloque' value progression. 'gain' values are transmitted via 'mosi' during active 'bloque' stages. It serves to encode clocked SPI transmissions with pre-set gain values."
