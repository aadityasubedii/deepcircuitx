    "spec": "Module name: ganancia\n\nModule specification: \nThe 'ganacia' module primarily pertains to digital amplified gain control. The module interfaces through an SPI protocol, transmitting gain values to an external device or circuit. The functioning of this module is triggered on the clock edges and is enabled or disabled by the 'clockenable' input. \n\nThis module presents four inputs: 'clock', the main control that synchronizes the operations, and 'clockenable', which authorizes the module to work when high. As for the outputs, there are four: 'mosi', which carries the gain value to the SPI bus, 'sck', which is the SPI bus clock, 'ampcs', a chip select for SPI interfaces, and 'ampshdn', a signal for potential control of amplifier power-down mode. \n\nInternally, 'ganancia' works with the 'bloque', 'gain', and 'estadosck' signals. 'bloque' is a 4-bit register, which dictates the operation state of the module. 'gain' is an 8-bit register carrying a predefined amplification value to be sent out through 'mosi'. 'estadosck' is a register governing the SPI clock flow. \n\nThe code is split into two sections with the first part initializing the values of all the signals. The next part entails an always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock. The 'ganacia' module moves according to the 'bloque' value. When 'bloque' is zero, the process is initiated. When it reaches nine, it resets and continues when 'bloque' is in-between. The last block ensures that only during the 'Bloque's active state does the 'gain' output to 'mosi'. \n\nOverall, the module functions to encode clocked SPI transmissions with pre-determined gain values.",

There are operations for controlling the gain value 'gain' and writing it out to the mosi (Master Out Slave In) wire, which is an output wire typically found in SPI communication interfaces. The variable 'bloque' is used to control state transitions under certain clock edges and its value changes the gain that is sent to the output. Other output wires include 'ampcs' which is a standard chip select wire in SPI and 'ampshdn' which is not explicitly used in this module but possibly for amplifier shutdown or similar controls in the larger context. The SPI clock 'sck' is also controlled by this module. In essence, it seems to sequence the transmission of gain values based on the clock signal when the enable signal is HIGH. However, the exact functionality can vary based on the larger system this module is part of."
