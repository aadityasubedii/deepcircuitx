This initial block is used to set up the initial/reset states for the flip flops or registers within the Verilog code. The initial begin-end block denotes that the given signals 'bloque', 'ampcs', 'ampshdn', 'estadosck', and 'mosi' are set to the stated values when the simulation starts. Specifically, 'bloque', 'ampshdn', 'estadosck' and 'mosi' are all initialized to '0', whereas 'ampcs' is initialized to '1'.
