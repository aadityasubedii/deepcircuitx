Comment: 
This block of code is a state machine, controlled by a clock signal and a clock enable signal. On the positive edge of the clock, it iterates over ten states (from 0 to 9), controlled by the 'bloque' variable. Initially, 'bloque' is set to 1 and the ampcs signal is set to 0. For states 1 to 8, the 'bloque' variable increments by 1 on each clock pulse and estadosck is set to 1. For state 9, 'bloque' is reset to 0, estadosck is set to 0, and ampcs is set to 1. The state machine will only function when clock enable signal is set to 1.
