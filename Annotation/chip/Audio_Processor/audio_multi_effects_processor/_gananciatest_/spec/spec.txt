Module name: gananciatest. 

Module specification: The 'gananciatest' module is primarily a test bench designed to perform testing on a module named 'ganancia'. It includes no explicit inputs, as it is self-contained and functions without any external data. This test bench primarily operates with two registers, 'clock' and 'clockenable', and five wires, namely 'mosi', 'sck', 'ampcs', 'ampshdn', and 'bloque', all of which can be considered output signals in the context of 'gananciatest'. The registers are used for generating the clock signal and the clock enable signal, while the wires are likely used for emulating data and control signals for the 'ganancia' module, though the exact behavior of these signals can't be ascertained without more context from the 'ganancia' module. 

The 'gananciatest' module instantiates the 'ganancia' module connecting it with the clock, clockenable, mosi, sck, ampcs, ampshdn, and bloque signals. The module is mainly composed of two initial blocks responsible for generating the sequences of the clock and clock enable signals. In the first initial block, the clock is toggled every 50 time units for 200 cycles. In the second initial block, the clockenable signal is toggled every 1000 time units for 10 cycles. This structure and signals enable a systematic way to test different states and behaviors of the 'ganancia' module.
