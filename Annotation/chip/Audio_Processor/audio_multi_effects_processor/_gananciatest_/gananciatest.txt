Module-level comment: The 'gananciatest' module serves as a test bench for the 'ganancia' module. It internally generates clock and clockenable signals, and uses these along with wires 'mosi', 'sck', 'ampcs', 'ampshdn', and 'bloque' to feed inputs to the instantiated 'ganancia' module. The testing pattern is established via initial blocks that control the toggling of the clock and clockenable signals across specified timeframes, effectively stimulating the 'ganancia' module under various conditions.
