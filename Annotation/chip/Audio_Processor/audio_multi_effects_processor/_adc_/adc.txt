Module-level comment: 

This adc module functions as an Analog to Digital Converter for incoming SPI data. Using a state machine controlled by 'bloque', it cycles through stages of operation, including sequential data acquisition from 'miso' into a temporary register 'datostemp', followed by the transfer to main output 'datos'. It signals completion of conversion through 'ready', with 'adconv' and 'sck' mimicking the clock signal based on flags 'estadoadconv' and 'estadosck'. It operates synchronously upon a positive clock edge when 'clockenable' is high.
