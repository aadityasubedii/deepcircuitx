Its inputs are the system clock, a clock enable signal, and a miso (Master In Slave Out) signal which is usually a data line in a SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) bus. The module has several outputs: adconv (presumably the ADC conversion signal), datos (a 12-bit wide digital output data bus), ready (a signal indicating when the data conversion is completed), and sck (a clock signal). \n\nIt makes use of a simple state machine that advances based on \"bloque\" variable. \"bloque\" advances upon each positive edge of the clock when clock enable is high until it reaches 34, at which point it resets to 0. During certain states (4 to 15), the miso input is written sequentially into a temporary 12-bit value, datostemp. When bloque is 16, the temporary value is moved from datostemp to the main 12-bit output bus, datos. When bloque is 34, the module indicates that the data conversion is done by setting the ready signal to a high value, which then resets to low when bloque goes back to 0. Overall, the module is performing a serial to parallel conversion of data to transform an incoming analog signal into a digital output."
