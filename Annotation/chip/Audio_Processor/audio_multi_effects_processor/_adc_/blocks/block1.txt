Comment: 
This block performs data processing and signal setting, conditioned on the 'bloque' counter value, in a synchronous manner on the falling edge of a clock signal. It sequentially captures 'miso' data values into the 'datostemp' array when 'bloque' lies between 4 and 15 inclusively. When 'bloque' is 16, it assigns the temporary data into 'datos'. On reaching 'bloque' 34, it signals readiness by setting 'ready' to 1. At 'bloque' 0, it resets 'ready' and 'estadosck' back to 0, while setting 'estadosck' to 1 if the 'bloque' is 1.
