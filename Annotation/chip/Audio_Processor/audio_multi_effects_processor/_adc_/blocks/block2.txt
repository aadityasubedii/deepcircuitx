Comment: 
This block of Verilog code primarily controls a clocked system with enable functionality, as well as maintaining a counter for a specific condition. Upon a positive edge of the clock signal and if the clock enable signal is active, the 'bloque' and 'estadoadconv' variables are set to 1. However, if 'bloque' hits 34, it's reset back to 0. In all other conditions, 'bloque' increments by one and 'estadoadconv' is set to 0.
