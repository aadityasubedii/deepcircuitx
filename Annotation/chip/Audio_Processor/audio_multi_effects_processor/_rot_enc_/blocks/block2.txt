Comment: 
This block handles the generation of rotation events based on the values of `rot_q1` signal and its delayed version, `delay_rot_q1`. The block is triggered at the rising edge of the clock `clk`. Initially, `rot_q1`'s current state is stored in `delay_rot_q1`. Then, if `rot_q1` is high and `delay_rot_q1` is low, which indicates a rising edge event, `rot_event` is set to 1 and `rot_left` is assigned the value of `rot_q2`, otherwise, they are both set to their previous state.
