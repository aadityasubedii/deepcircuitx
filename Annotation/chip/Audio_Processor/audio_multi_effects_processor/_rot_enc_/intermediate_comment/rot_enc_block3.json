    "block_comment": "The block performs rotation encoding at each clock pulse. It first stores the input rotation values 'rot_A' and 'rot_B' into 'rot_A_in' and 'rot_B_in'. Following this, it combines the two newly stored values into 'rot_in'. The switch-case construct is employed to decode the 'rot_in' and set the output, 'rot_q1' and 'rot_q2', accordingly. These values are maintained at their previous states if they do not satisfy any cases."
