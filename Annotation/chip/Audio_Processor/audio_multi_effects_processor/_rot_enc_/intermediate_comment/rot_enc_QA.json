It processes these signals and outputs the rotation event (rot_event) and the direction of rotation (rot_left). The module uses clock signal (clk) for synchronization. The first always block is remarkably a Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation that uses case statements to determine states based on the combination of rotary inputs. The second always block captures the rotor movement event (either a rotation has occurred or not) and the direction of rotation. The output (rlrot) represents the rotation event and direction.\n"
