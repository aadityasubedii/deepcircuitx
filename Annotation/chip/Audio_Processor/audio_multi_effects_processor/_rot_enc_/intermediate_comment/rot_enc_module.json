    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'rot_enc' module is a Rotary Encoder which detects and codes rotation events and their directions from input signals 'rot_A' and 'rot_B'. It employs a state machine, triggered by the 'clk' input, to process the signals. The module uses a series of internal variables and registers to track states ('rot_q1', 'rot_q2'), manage signal inputs ('rot_A_in', 'rot_B_in'), and capture rotation events and directions ('rot_event', 'rot_left'). The output ('rlrot') is a 2-bit signal combining 'rot_event' and 'rot_left'."
