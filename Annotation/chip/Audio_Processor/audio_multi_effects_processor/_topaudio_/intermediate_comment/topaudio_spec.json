    "spec": "Module name: topaudio. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe topaudio module serves as the main controller for an audio processing system in Verilog. The module weaves together a range of audio processing elements such as overdrive, delay, echo, and reverb along with gain control, ADC and DAC. It uses a rotary encoder and frequency divider for control and synchronization purposes respectively. \n\nThis module has a variety of input ports. The 'clock' is a system clock input for synchronization. 'rot_a' and 'rot_b' inputs come from a rotary encoder and are likely used for controlling audio parameters. 'swDIS', 'swDEL', 'swECHO', and 'swREVERB' are used for triggering different audio effects. The 'miso' port is used for SPI communication.\n\nThe module produces several outputs including 'adconv' and 'ready', corresponding to ADC operations. SPI communication utilizes 'sck' and 'mosi' outputs. 'daccs' and 'dacclr' are control signals for the DAC. Other control signals include 'spissb', 'sf_ce0', 'fpgainitb', 'ampcs', and 'ampshdn'. The module also produces 'Egain', 'Eadc', and 'Edac' enable signals, along with 'effect_OUT' and 'datosINTERNO', which are the processed audio output and internal data respectively.\n\nInternally, topaudio employs several signals. 'clockslow' is used as a slower clock reference, 'enablegain', 'enableadc', and 'enabledac' act as enable signals for gain, ADC, and DAC units. 'mosigain', 'sckgain', 'mosidac', and 'sckdac' help in SPI communication for respective units. 'rotation', 'datosinterno', 'internoDIST', 'internoDELAY', 'internoECHO', 'internoREVERB' and 'effect_out' signal are used in managing, processing and transferring audio data within the system.\n\nThe code for this module is composed of several blocks, each representing a different unit. This includes \u2018rot_enc\u2019 for rotary encoder, the effects units 'REVERB', 'ECHO', 'overdrive', and 'Delay'. 'fredivider' serves as a frequency divier, 'controlador' acts as a controller to manage different units, 'ganancia' for gain control, 'adc' and 'dac' for analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions, respectively. All the blocks interact intelligently through a structured network of signals and control logic to facilitate top-level audio processing and control.",
