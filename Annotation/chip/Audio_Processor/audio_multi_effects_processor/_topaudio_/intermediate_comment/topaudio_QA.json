The components include various effects like overdrive, delay, echo, and reverb. Also, there are modules for gain control (ganancia), Analog to Digital Converter (adc), and Digital to Analog Converter (dac). Additionally, the controller (controlador) regulates other hardware units, while the rotary encoder (rot_enc) and frequency divider (fredivider) manage input signal handling and clock signal respectively. On a high level, it seems to apply selected effects to an input audio signal and manage conversions between digital and analog signals."
