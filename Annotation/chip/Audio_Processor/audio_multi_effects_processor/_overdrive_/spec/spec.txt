Module name: overdrive. 

Module specification: The overdrive module is essentially a signal processing unit, implementing an adjustable 'clipping' function. Its primary operation involves comparing a 12-bit input data ('DATA_IN') against an adaptive threshold ('THRES') and dynamically controlling this threshold with a 2-bit control signal ('rlrot'). With inputs 'clk', 'rlrot', and 'DATA_IN', as well as output 'DATA_OUT', this module exhibits considerable flexibility. 'clk' denotes the system clock, driving synchronous changes. 'rlrot' determines how the threshold value behaves, incrementing if 'rlrot' is '11' and decrementing if it is '10'. 'DATA_IN' is compared against 'THRES' to dictate the value of 'DATA_OUT', which essentially reflects the processed input signal. The internal signal 'THRES' serves as our dynamic threshold, initially set to 800, it adjusts between 100 and 1500 based on the value of 'rlrot'. The module's functionality can be split into two primary operations. Firstly, an always block on clock's positive edge governs threshold adjustment based on 'rlrot'. Secondly, another always block, triggered by changes in 'DATA_IN' or 'THRES', executes the comparison operation and sets 'DATA_OUT'.
