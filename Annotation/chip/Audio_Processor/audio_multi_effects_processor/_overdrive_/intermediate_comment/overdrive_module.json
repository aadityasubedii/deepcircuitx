    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'overdrive' module compares a 12-bit input ('DATA_IN') to an adjustable threshold ('THRES'). The threshold is controlled by a 2-bit input ('rlrot'), where '11' increases and '10' decreases 'THRES', within 100-1500 range. If 'DATA_IN' exceeds 'THRES', 'DATA_OUT' maintains its prior value; otherwise, 'DATA_OUT' equals 'DATA_IN'. Achieving this function, it uses two blocks: one changing 'THRES' based on 'rlrot' at every clock cycle, another comparing 'DATA_IN' with 'THRES' and setting 'DATA_OUT' accordingly."
