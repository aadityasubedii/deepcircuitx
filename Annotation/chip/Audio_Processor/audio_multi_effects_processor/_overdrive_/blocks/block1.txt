Comment: 
This block of code performs a threshold check function on incoming data. When a new data or new threshold appears, it explicitly compares the input data (DATA_IN) with a threshold value (THRES). If the incoming value is greater than the threshold, the previously stored value in DATA_OUT is retained, otherwise the input data is stored in DATA_OUT.
