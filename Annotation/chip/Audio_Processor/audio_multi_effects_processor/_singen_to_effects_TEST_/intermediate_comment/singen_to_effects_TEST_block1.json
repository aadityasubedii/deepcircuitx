    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a clock signal. The operation of this block is implemented through the use of always construct and a delay statement. It works by inverting the value of the clock ('clk') signal every 5 units of simulation time, thereby generating a periodic clock signal with a period of 10 time units."
