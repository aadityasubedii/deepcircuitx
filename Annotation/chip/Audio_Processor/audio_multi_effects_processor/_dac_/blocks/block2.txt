The function of this block of code is to control a specific process, depending on a system clock and an enable condition. When the clock signal rises and the clock enable is true, the block triggers. If the 'bloque' variable is 0, it will set 'bloque' to 1 and 'daccs' to 0. When the 'bloque' is 33, it resets 'bloque' to 0, sets 'daccs' to 1 and resets 'estadosck'. For all other values, 'bloque' increments by 1 and 'estadosck' is set to 1.
