    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the value of the output signal 'mosi' based on the variable 'bloque'. The 'mosi' signal is assigned different bit values from the 'command', 'address' and 'datos2compl' respectively depending on the current value of 'bloque'. This is implemented within a synchronous block, which updates the 'mosi' value at every negative edge of the clock signal ensuring synchronization with system clock. If 'bloque' falls outside specified ranges, 'mosi' is set to 0."
