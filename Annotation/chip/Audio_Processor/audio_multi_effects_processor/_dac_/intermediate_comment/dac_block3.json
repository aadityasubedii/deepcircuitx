    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is responsible for initial setup. It sets the default values for the 'daccs', 'bloque', 'estadosck', and 'mosi' signals at the beginning of the simulation run. 'daccs' and 'mosi' are initialized to logic high and 'bloque' and 'estadosck' are initialized to logic low. This initial setup ensures a known starting state for simulation purposes. Hence, it acts as an essential preparatory step before further operations."
