    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'dac' module functions as an interface within a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) system through the SPI protocol. It governs command, address, and data transmission through the 'mosi' output upon proper clock and clockenable signals. Internal hierarchical blocks of code, synced with clock edges, orchestrate signal transmission sequences, with block/state control on the positive clock edge and MOSI output set up on the negative clock edge. Some internal signals and their states are found pre-determined ('command', 'address') to meet specific DAC requests."
