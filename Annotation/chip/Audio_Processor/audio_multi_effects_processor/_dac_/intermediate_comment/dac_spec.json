    "spec": "Module name: dac. \n\nModule specification: The 'dac' module is a critical component of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) system that operates through SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). The module's operation synchronizes on the positive and negative edges of a clock signal, where the positive edge deals with the block/state management, and the negative edge adjusts output 'mosi' according to the block/state. \n\nThe module inputs include 'clock', the primary timing signal, 'clockenable' acting as a control to allow or suspend operations, and a 12-bit 'datos' as the primary data input. The module outputs consist of 'mosi,' the main data signal that holds the command, address, or 'datos' in two's complement form, 'daccs' acting as a control signal to manage the start and end of data block transmission, 'sck' which serves as the clock for the SPI, and 'dacclr' which appears to function as a reset signal for the external DAC.\n\nInternal signals encompass 'datos2compl', holding the 2's complement of 'datos', 'bloque' that keeps track of the current block number or state, 'estadosck' controlling the output 'sck', 'command' holding a hardcoded DAC command, and 'address' holding a hardcoded DAC address. \n\nIn terms of functionality, two 'always' blocks driven by positive and negative clock edge form the main code. The positive edge block handles the state management and transitions, while the negative edge block controls the outgoing SPI signal based on state. It results in an overall SPI interface module for DAC, capable of transmitting commands, addresses, and data sequentially and in sync with the clock signal.",

On each positive edge of the clock, if clockenable is true, it generates a sequence by iterating through blocks. Command, address, and 2's complement of input data \"datos\" are sent sequentially via 'mosi' output. Control signals like 'daccs' and 'sck' are also generated as per block number. The execution of blocks is spread across both positive and negative edge of the clock where the positive edge controls the state/blocks and the negative edge sets output 'mosi' according to the block state. The final output can be controlled through a series of SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) commands, making it suitable for a range of uses."

The least significant bit of this wire is the negations of the least significant bit of 'datos', and the rest of the bits are equal to 'datos[1:11]'. It is used while setting the 'mosi' output in the negedge clock 'always' block.\n- bloque: It's a 6-bit register that stores the current block number or state of the SPI interface sequence. It increments on every positive clock edge if clockenable is '1', and reset to '0' at the end of sequence or when a new sequence is starting.\n- estadosck: It's a single bit register, used to control the output 'sck'. 'sck' is equal to 'clock' if 'estadosck' is '1' else it's '0'. This allows to select the data on positive edge of 'clock', replicating master SPI behavior.\n- command: It's a 4-bit register used to store the command sent out to the DAC. It's hardcoded to binary '0011' in the design. It's set as output 'mosi' when 'bloque' is between 9 and 12.\n- address: It's a 4-bit register used to store address sent to the DAC. It's hardcoded to binary '0000' in the design. It's set as output 'mosi' when 'bloque' is between 13 and 16."
