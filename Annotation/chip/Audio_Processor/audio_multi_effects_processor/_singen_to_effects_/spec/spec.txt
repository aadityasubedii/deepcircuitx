Module name: singen_to_effects. 

Module specification: The singen_to_effects is a module serving as a sine wave generator and processor for various sound effects including Overdrive (OD), Delay, Reverb, and Echo. This generator design operates synchronously governed by a clock signal, defined by the single input port 'clk'. This input clock port maintains module timing and synchronized operations amongst internal components. On the output side, it sports five output ports: ([11:0] data_out_sin, data_out_OD, data_out_DELAY, data_out_REVERB, data_out_ECHO). Each output port corresponds to different processed versions of the generated sine wave. 'data_out_sin' provides the original waveform, 'data_out_OD', 'data_out_DELAY', 'data_out_REVERB' and 'data_out_ECHO' outputs the Overdrive, Delay, Reverb, and Echo-processed waveform respectively. Internally, a 12-bit wide wire 'sin_to_eff' channels the sine wave output from the generator to the inputs of the different sound effects modules for further processing. The module encapsulates multiple blocks including a sine wave generator 'singen', and four sound effect processors: Overdrive 'OD', Delay 'DEL', Reverb 'rev', and Echo 'ech', each modifies the original sine wave and presents their outcomes through respective output ports. In essence, this module functions as a sine wave sound generator and processor for a range of sound effects, exhibiting versatility in implementing various sound effect alterations to a base sine wave.
