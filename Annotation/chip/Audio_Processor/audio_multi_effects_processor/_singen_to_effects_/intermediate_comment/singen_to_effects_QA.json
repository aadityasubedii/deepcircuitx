It uses a generated sine wave as an input for several sound effects modules: Overdrive (OD), Delay, Reverb, and Echo. The output of each sound effect module is then provided as the output of the singen_to_effects module. All modules are clocked synchronously."

Explanation: \n\n- data_out_sin: This is the output of the sinewave generated. It is connected to the output of the sine wave generator, and it provides the original wave before effect processing.\n\n- data_out_OD: This is the output after Overdrive processing. The output sine wave from the sinewave generator is passed through Overdrive, processed, and the result is output on this port.\n\n- data_out_DELAY: This port outputs the delayed version of the generated sinewave. It receives data processed by the Delay module.\n\n- data_out_REVERB: This outputs the sinewave after being processed by the reverb effect. It gets its data from the REVERB module.\n\n- data_out_ECHO: This port outputs the sinewave signal after it has been processed by the Echo effect. The ECHO module handles the necessary processing and passes its data to this output."

Essentially, it acts as a conduit to channel the generated sine wave to these modules. Its width is 12 bits, matching the requirements of the effects modules and ensuring that the full precision of the output of the sine wave generator is maintained."
