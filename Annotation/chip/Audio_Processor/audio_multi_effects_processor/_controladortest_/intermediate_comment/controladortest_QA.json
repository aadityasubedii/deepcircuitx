The main purpose of this module is to generate a clock signal that is used to test the functionality of the \"controlador\" module. No specific operation is performed by this module other than the generation of the clock signal. The state of the clock signal is toggled 300 times at specific intervals as controlled by the delay specified in the code. All other wires declared are used as interconnections with the \"controlador\" module, however, no values are assigned to them in this test module itself."

It toggles between 0 and 1 at certain intervals.\n\n- enablegain, enableadc, enabledac: These are control signals used to enable or disable the gain function, ADC (Analog to Digital Converter), and DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) inside controlador.
