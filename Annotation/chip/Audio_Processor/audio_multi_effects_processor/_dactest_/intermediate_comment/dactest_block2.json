    "block_comment": "The block of code implements a simple clock generator and initializes some signals in a test bench. It initializes 'clock' and 'clockenable' signals to 0 and 'datos' signal to 2357. After waiting for 100 unit time, it toggles the clock signal with a delay of 50 unit time for 340 cycles. This creates a regular clock or pulse train which can be used to simulate synchronous hardware in a test environment."
