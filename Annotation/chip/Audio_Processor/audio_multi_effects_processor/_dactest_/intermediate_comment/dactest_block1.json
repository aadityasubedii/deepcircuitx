    "block_comment": "This block initializes and controls the clock signal and data transmission within a circuit. It starts by setting the 'clock' and 'clockenable' signals low, and initializing the 'datos' signal with a predefined value. After waiting for a 50-unit delay, it toggles the 'clockenable' signal 5 times with a delay of 3400 units between each toggle."
