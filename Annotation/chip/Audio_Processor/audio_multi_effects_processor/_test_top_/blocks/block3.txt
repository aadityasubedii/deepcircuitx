Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is designed as a test bench to sequentially enable and disable specific sound effects, specifically distortion (swDIS), delay (swDEL), echo (swECHO), and reverb (swREVERB). The block initializes each sound effect switch to '0', essentially disabling all of them at the beginning. It then enables each switch one by one for a duration of 40,000 time units, causing each sound effect to be applied sequentially before being turned off.
