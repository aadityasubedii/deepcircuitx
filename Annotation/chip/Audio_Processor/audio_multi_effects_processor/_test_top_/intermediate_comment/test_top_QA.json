It also interacts with interfaces related to an external audio processing component. swDIS, swDEL, swECHO, and swREVERB appear to be switches that are turned on and off in order. There are also two other signals, clock and miso, which are toggled in a loop a certain number of times. This module does not provide direct functionality but is used for testing or simulation purposes."
