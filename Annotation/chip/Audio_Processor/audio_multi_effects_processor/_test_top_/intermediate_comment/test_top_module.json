    "module": "Module-level comment: This is the 'test_top' module, designed to set up a test environment for the 'topaudio' module. It employs various control switches (swDIS, swDEL, swECHO, and swREVERB) and toggleable signals ('clock' & 'miso'), following a specific sequence, to simulate realistic conditions. The module begins with initial values for switches and patterns for 'clock' and 'miso' signals. Implementation occurs in three distinct initial blocks to establish the order of operations. Detailed functionality depends on the 'topaudio' module's specifics.\n"
