    "block_comment": "The block initializes a simple clock signal and miso signal in a Verilog testbench. Initially, the `clock` signal is set to `0` and `miso` is also set to `0`. After an initial delay of `#100` simulation units, a repeat loop toggles the `clock` signal every `#50` simulation units for `2500*10**3` iterations, effectively creating a clock signal with a period of `#100` simulation units."
