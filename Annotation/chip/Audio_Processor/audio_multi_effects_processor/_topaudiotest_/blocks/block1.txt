Comment: 
This block of code is primarily responsible for initializing and toggling the values of the "clock" and "miso" signals. Initially, both the "clock" and "miso" signals are set to zero. After a delay of 100 units of simulation time, a loop commences that repeats 25,000 times (derived from 1250*10*2). Within this loop, the value of "miso" is inverted (or toggled) and after each inversion, a delay of 1000 units of simulation time is inserted.
