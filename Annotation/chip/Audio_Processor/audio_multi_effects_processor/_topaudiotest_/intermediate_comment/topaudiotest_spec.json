    "spec": "Module name: topaudiotest. \n\nModule specification: The 'topaudiotest' is primarily a testbench for the 'topaudio' module. It emulates the digital timing signals by generating simulated clock and 'Master In Slave Out' (miso) signals, which control the timing of operations within the 'topaudio' module. The inputs to this module are 'clock' and 'miso', wherein 'clock' acts as a heart beat for synchronized operations and 'miso' registers the transfer of data from a slave system to a master system. The outputs range from 'adconv', 'ready', 'sck', 'mosi', 'daccs', 'dacclr', 'spissb', 'sf_ce0', 'fpgainitb', 'ampcs', 'ampshdn', 'Egain', 'Eadc', 'Edac' to 'datosINTERNO'. All these signals are connected to matching signals in 'topaudio', essentially acting as a virtual layout for the 'topaudio' module. The 'topaudiotest' includes two initial blocks - the first block generates the clock signal and the second block generates the 'miso' signal. The functionality of these blocks is to produce a continuous pulse train by toggling the values of 'clock' and 'miso' respectively after certain delays, thereby simulating their real-time behaviour. This allows for proper testing of the behaviour of 'topaudio' under these signals.",
