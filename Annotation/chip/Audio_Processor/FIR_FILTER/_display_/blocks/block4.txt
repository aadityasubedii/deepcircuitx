This block of code is responsible for updating the state register `streg` based on the clock edge and reset signal conditions. Every positive edge of a clock, the logic inside the `always` block is executed. If the reset signal is high, the state register `streg` is updated with the `st_done` state, returning the system to a known, default state. Otherwise, `streg` is simply updated with the value of `st`.
