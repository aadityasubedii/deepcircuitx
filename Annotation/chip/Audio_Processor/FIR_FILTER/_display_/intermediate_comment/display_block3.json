    "block_comment": "This block is a synchronous delay counter with reset and state done handling capabilities. On a positive clock edge, if the reset signal is high, it resets the delay counter and variable x to zero. If the reset signal is not high and the state register signal indicates a 'done' state, it checks whether the delay_counter has reached the sweep_delay value. If it has, it resets the delay counter and increments the variable x, unless x has already reached xmax, in which case it resets x. If the delay_counter has not yet reached sweep_delay, it increments the delay_counter."
