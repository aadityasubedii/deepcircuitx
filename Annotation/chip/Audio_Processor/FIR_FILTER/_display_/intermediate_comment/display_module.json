    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'display' module is a controller for digital displays, determining X, Y coordinates and color data generation. This operation is achieved through a state machine, which updates Y coordinates until they reach 'ymax', pausing if needed based on 'freeze' input. Internal signals and registers control the sequence, with 'sweep_delay' setting speed. X coordinate increments until 'xmax', then resets. With clock cycle examination, 'delay_counter', 'st', 'streg' modify state and coordinate updates. 'plot' and 'color' are final outputs."
