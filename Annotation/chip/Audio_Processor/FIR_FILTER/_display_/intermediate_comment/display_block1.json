    "block_comment": "This block of code performs comparison and assignment tasks. The first line checks if the current state of the variable 'streg' equals 'st_ploty' and assigns the result (true or false) to the variable 'plot'. The second line combines the 8-bit decimal number 120 with the value at the 15th position of the 'data' array and with the values at positions 6 through 0 of the same array, performs a comparison with 'y', and assigns the result to the variable 'color'."
