Explanation: This module is a display controller that generates X, Y coordinates and color information for a digital plotter or display. It uses a state machine where it keeps updating Y coordinate until 'ymax' value is reached and then returns to initial state. If 'freeze' is not activated and a certain 'sweep_delay' has been reached, it again goes back to Y-plotting state. When it comes to updating X coordinate, it's incremented until 'xmax' value is hit, and then reset to zero. It also handles reset situations, resetting several values to their initial state when a reset signal is received."
