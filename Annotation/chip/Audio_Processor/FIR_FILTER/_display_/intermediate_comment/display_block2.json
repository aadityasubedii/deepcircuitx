    "block_comment": "The block of code functions as a counter in Verilog that can be reset. When a positive edge of a clock pulse is detected, the counter checks whether the reset signal is active, or the streg state machine is in the \"done\" state. If either condition is met, the counter is reset to 0. Otherwise, as long as the current count 'y' is less than a specified maximum value 'ymax', the counter increments by one at each clock pulse."
