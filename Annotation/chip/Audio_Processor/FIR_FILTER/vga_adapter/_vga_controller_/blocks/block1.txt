This block of code handles the conversion of a pixel's color data to its VGA display colors. It begins by initializing the VGA color channels (Red - VGA_R, Green - VGA_G, Blue - VGA_B) to 0. It then checks if the MONOCHROME mode is set or not. If not set, it sequentially fills up the VGA color channels with the respective bits of the pixel color, wherein color separation is managed by BITS_PER_COLOUR_CHANNEL for each color bit-depth. If MONOCHROME mode is set, all the color channels of the VGA signal are equalized to the first bit of the pixel color, leading to a black and white output.
