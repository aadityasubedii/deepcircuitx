Comment: 
The block serves as a counter with synchronous reset functionality. When the reset line (resetn) is active (low in this case), regardless of the VGA clock, the counter (xCounter) is reset to zero. Similarly, the counter is reset when clear flag (xCounter_clear) is active (high). In the case when resetn is not active and xCounter_clear is not active, at every rising edge of the VGA clock, the counter increments by 1.
