This block defines a digital logic that sets the `yCounter_clear` signal when `yCounter` equals `(C_VERT_TOTAL_COUNT-1)` (the maximum vertical count minus one). It is implemented using an assign statement, which instantaneously updates `yCounter_clear` whenever `yCounter` or `C_VERT_TOTAL_COUNT` changes, acting like a continuous assignment or wire.
