    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a portion of a VGA (Video Graphics Array) display system, specifically the yCounter functionality. The yCounter is incremented with each 'vga_clock' cycle after 'xCounter' is cleared, indicating the start of a new row. If a reset signal is detected or both 'xCounter' and 'yCounter' are cleared, the 'yCounter' value is set to zero, effectively starting the counting operation anew. This facilitates tracking the row position in a VGA display rendering process."
