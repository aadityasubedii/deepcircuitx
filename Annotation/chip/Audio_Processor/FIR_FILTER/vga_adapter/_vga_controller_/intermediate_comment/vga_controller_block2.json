    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for assigning a constant voltage level to the 'VGA_SYNC' signal. In its implementation, it utilizes the 'assign' keyword of Verilog RTL, which allows for continuous assignment. The value 'vcc', representing a power supply voltage, is constantly assigned to 'VGA_SYNC' signal, presumably to keep it at an active level or reference voltage."
