    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for controlling the timing of vertical and horizontal signals for a VGA display. The code is triggered on each positive edge of the VGA clock. First, it negates the conditions to obtain the active low VGA horizontal and vertical sync signals (VGA_HS1, VGA_VS1). The conditions check whether the current counters (xCounter and yCounter) fall within a defined sync range. Then it determines VGA blanking status (VGA_BLANK1), by checking if the counters are within the range of visible pixels. Last, it assignments the calculated signal values to the VGA_HS, VGA_VS, and VGA_BLANK outputs."
