    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for initiating a counter reset. This is achieved by comparing the current count of xCounter with the pre-defined constant C_HORZ_TOTAL_COUNT reduced by one. Once xCounter meets this condition, xCounter_clear will be assigned a logic high signal thereby initiating a counter clear operation."
