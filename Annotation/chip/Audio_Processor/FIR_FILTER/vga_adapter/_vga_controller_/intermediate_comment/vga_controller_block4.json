    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for setting the mapping of the x and y counters based on the resolution value. Depending on the predefined RESOLUTION string value, it assigns a specific bit range of the xCounter and yCounter to x and y variables respectively. When the resolution is \"320x240\", the 2nd to 10th bits of xCounter and the 2nd to 9th bits of yCounter are assigned to x and y respectively, while if the resolution differs, the 3rd to 10th bits of xCounter and the 3rd to 9th bits of yCounter are employed. This caters for the demands of different screen resolutions."
