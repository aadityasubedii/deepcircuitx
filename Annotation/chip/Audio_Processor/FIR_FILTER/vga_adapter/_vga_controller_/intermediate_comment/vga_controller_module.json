    "module": "Module-level comment: The vga_controller module is responsible for high-level VGA signal generation and display management, supporting both monochrome and color modes with adaptable screen resolutions. It employs `xCounter` and `yCounter` to map the pixel positioning, utilizes a sub-module `vga_address_translator` for memory addressing, and assigns pixel color from `pixel_colour` input. Operating heavily on the vga_clock signal, this module processes VGA parameters (`VGA_HS, VGA_VS, VGA_BLANK`) and assigns them to the output ports for synchronization and visualization purposes."
