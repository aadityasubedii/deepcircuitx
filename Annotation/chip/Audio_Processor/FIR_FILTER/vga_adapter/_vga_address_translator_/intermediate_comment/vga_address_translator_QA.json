The parameters x, y represent the horizontal and vertical positions in a VGA display. The module supports two distinct resolutions - \"320x240\" and \"160x120\", dictating the bit width of calculations and addresses. Depending on the resolution set by the RESOLUTION parameter, it provides the corresponding memory address. These addresses are used in graphical operations for a VGA monitor. The translation from VGA coordinates to memory addresses is essential for rendering pixels onto the display."

Their widths change with respect to screen resolution, which can be \"320x240\" or \"160x120\". These inputs serve as the basis for identifying pixel positions on the VGA screen.\n\nOutput ports: `mem_address`.\nExplanation: `mem_address` is the translated memory address corresponding to a specific screen pixel. This memory address is formed based on the VGA coordinates input and the selected resolution. This variable is used to save or retrieve pixel data in or from the right memory location for rendering the VGA screen. The output's bit width also varies relying on the screen resolution, either \"320x240\" or \"160x120\"."

It is used to calculate the memory address corresponding to input coordinates for a VGA screen of resolution \"320x240\". This calculation involves the vertical position (`y`) and the horizontal position (`x`). The vertical coordinate 'y' gets two shifts to the left (equivalent to multiplication by 4), effectively prioritizing the column address and then it is added to the `x` coordinate. \n\n- `res_160x120`: Similar to `res_320x240`, `res_160x120` is a 16-bit wire for the resolution \"160x120\". The address calculation follows the same logic as in `res_320x240`, albeit with different shifts due to the change in screen size."
