    "spec": "Module name: vga_address_translator. \nModule specification: The module named 'vga_address_translator' is a key component in VGA based graphical operations, designed to translate VGA coordinates to memory addresses. This translation is pivotal for rendering pixels onto the display, as it navigates the pixel data to the appropriate memory location. The module supports two resolutions - \"320x240\" and \"160x120\", varying the information bit width accordingly. The input ports are 'x' and 'y' representing the respective horizontal and vertical positions on a VGA display screen. The calculation of the memory addresses is based on these inputs. The output port is 'mem_address', which furnishes the corresponding memory address for the input VGA coordinates. Internally, the module uses two signals - 'res_320x240' and 'res_160x120'. These signals serve to calculate the memory addresses for the two supported resolutions, implementing shifts and additions to prioritize the column address within the VGA coordinates. The primary logical block in this module checks for the set resolution and assigns the respective memory address to the output, ensuring the correct address assignment per resolution. The 'vga_address_translator' module is crucial in enhancing the organization and complexity of data manipulation in VGA based visual applications.",

The parameters x, y represent the horizontal and vertical positions in a VGA display. The module supports two distinct resolutions - \"320x240\" and \"160x120\", dictating the bit width of calculations and addresses.

It is used to calculate the memory address corresponding to input coordinates for a VGA screen of resolution \"320x240\". This calculation involves the vertical position (`y`) and the horizontal position (`x`). The vertical coordinate 'y' gets two shifts to the left (equivalent to multiplication by 4), effectively prioritizing the column address and then it is added to the `x` coordinate. \n\n- `res_160x120`: Similar to `res_320x240`, `res_160x120` is a 16-bit wire for the resolution \"160x120\".
