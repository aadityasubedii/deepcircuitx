    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for setting the memory address based on the resolution of the system. The implementation itself is quite straightforward, using a conditional structure (if/else) to determine which resolution is currently selected. If the RESOLUTION variable is set to \"320x240\", the mem_address uses the value of res_320x240. Otherwise, it uses the subset of res_160x120's bits from 14 to 0."
