    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'vga_address_translator' module translates VGA screen coordinates into accurate memory addresses. Given 'x' and 'y' inputs denoting horizontal and vertical positions, it computes memory addresses based on the set resolution (\"320x240\" or \"160x120\"). Internal signals 'res_320x240' and 'res_160x120' serve to calculate these addresses, using shifts and additions, prioritizing column address. A logical block then assigns these addresses to the 'mem_address' output, respecting the screen resolution setting. This module plays a vital role in VGA based graphical operations."
