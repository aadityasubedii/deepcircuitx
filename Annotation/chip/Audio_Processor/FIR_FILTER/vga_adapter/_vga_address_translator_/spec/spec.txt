Module name: vga_address_translator. 
Module specification: The module named 'vga_address_translator' is a key component in VGA based graphical operations, designed to translate VGA coordinates to memory addresses. This translation is pivotal for rendering pixels onto the display, as it navigates the pixel data to the appropriate memory location. The module supports two resolutions - "320x240" and "160x120", varying the information bit width accordingly. The input ports are 'x' and 'y' representing the respective horizontal and vertical positions on a VGA display screen. The calculation of the memory addresses is based on these inputs. The output port is 'mem_address', which furnishes the corresponding memory address for the input VGA coordinates. Internally, the module uses two signals - 'res_320x240' and 'res_160x120'. These signals serve to calculate the memory addresses for the two supported resolutions, implementing shifts and additions to prioritize the column address within the VGA coordinates. The primary logical block in this module checks for the set resolution and assigns the respective memory address to the output, ensuring the correct address assignment per resolution. The 'vga_address_translator' module is crucial in enhancing the organization and complexity of data manipulation in VGA based visual applications.
