    "spec": "Module name: vga_adapter. \n\nModule specification: The 'vga_adapter' module is responsible for managing VGA screen control operations. The functionality primarily involves managing input parameters and forwarding them to various submodules such as, 'vga_address_translator', 'altsyncram'(VideoMemory), and 'vga_controller'. This module calculates the 'writeEn' and 'valid' signals for write operations based on the screen resolutions and boundaries. It uses 'altsyncram' as dual-port RAM to store pixel colour input and provides this information to 'vga_controller' for output to the VGA screen.\n\nThe input ports include 'resetn', 'clock', 'clock_25', 'colour', 'x', 'y', and 'plot'. 'resetn' is used for module reset, 'clock' and 'clock_25' are clock signals, 'colour' represents the colour to be plotted, 'x' and 'y' are VGA display co-ordinates and 'plot' controls writing operation. The output ports are 'VGA_R', 'VGA_G', 'VGA_B', 'VGA_HS', 'VGA_VS', 'VGA_BLANK', 'VGA_SYNC'; these signals are related to VGA screen, colours channels, synchronizing signals and blanking the VGA screen.\n\nInternal signals include 'valid_160x120', 'valid_320x240', 'writeEn', 'to_ctrl_colour', 'user_to_video_memory_addr', 'controller_to_video_memory_addr', 'vcc', and 'gnd'. These signals are used to validate and manage the write operations, colour value for VGA controller, address storing in VideoMemory for user and controller, and logic high and low signals.\n\nAbout blocks of the code: The code employs 'vga_address_translator' to convert X and Y coordinates to address, 'altsyncram'(VideoMemory) to cache the pixel colour data, and 'vga_controller' to generate the VGA output based on the pixel colour information retrieved from the VideoMemory. Functionality wise, it receives plotting parameters, calculates the screen validity and write enable signals, stores and retrieves pixel colours from memory and generates the VGA screen output.",

It checks if the x and y are within the required range for this resolution and if this resolution is the chosen one.\n\n- 'valid_320x240': Similar to valid_160x120, but this signal is used for a resolution of 320x240.\n\n- 'writeEn': This is the write-enable signal used to control writing into the VideoMemory. The writing operation takes place when 'plot' is high, and the x, y coordinates are valid for the chosen resolution.\n\n- 'to_ctrl_colour': This signal comes from the output of the VideoMemory and represents the color value that is going to be used by the VGA controller to generate the video output.\n\n- 'user_to_video_memory_addr': This signal represents the address in VideoMemory at which the user-supplied color will be stored. The address is generated based on the x-y coordinates by the 'vga_address_translator' module.\n\n- 'controller_to_video_memory_addr': This signal represents the address in the VideoMemory which the controller reads from.

The functionality primarily involves managing input parameters and forwarding them to various submodules such as, 'vga_address_translator', 'altsyncram'(VideoMemory), and 'vga_controller'. This module calculates the 'writeEn' and 'valid' signals for write operations based on the screen resolutions and boundaries. It uses 'altsyncram' as dual-port RAM to store pixel colour input and provides this information to 'vga_controller' for output to the VGA screen.\n\nThe input ports include 'resetn', 'clock', 'clock_25', 'colour', 'x', 'y', and 'plot'. 'resetn' is used for module reset, 'clock' and 'clock_25' are clock signals, 'colour' represents the colour to be plotted, 'x' and 'y' are VGA display co-ordinates and 'plot' controls writing operation. The output ports are 'VGA_R', 'VGA_G', 'VGA_B', 'VGA_HS', 'VGA_VS', 'VGA_BLANK', 'VGA_SYNC'; these signals are related to VGA screen, colours channels, synchronizing signals and blanking the VGA screen.\n\nInternal signals include 'valid_160x120', 'valid_320x240', 'writeEn', 'to_ctrl_colour', 'user_to_video_memory_addr', 'controller_to_video_memory_addr', 'vcc', and 'gnd'. These signals are used to validate and manage the write operations, colour value for VGA controller, address storing in VideoMemory for user and controller, and logic high and low signals.\n\nAbout blocks of the code: The code employs 'vga_address_translator' to convert X and Y coordinates to address, 'altsyncram'(VideoMemory) to cache the pixel colour data, and 'vga_controller' to generate the VGA output based on the pixel colour information retrieved from the VideoMemory. Functionality wise, it receives plotting parameters, calculates the screen validity and write enable signals, stores and retrieves pixel colours from memory and generates the VGA screen output."
