    "block_comment": "This particular statement assigns the signal `write_audio_out` based on the comparison result between `st` and `st_pl_ram_nextaddr`. If the current state `st` is equal to the next address state `st_pl_ram_nextaddr`, this means the audio output is ready to be written and the signal `write_audio_out` is set to true. Otherwise, it remains false. This is used for managing the audio output writing sequence in synchronization with the state machine flow."
