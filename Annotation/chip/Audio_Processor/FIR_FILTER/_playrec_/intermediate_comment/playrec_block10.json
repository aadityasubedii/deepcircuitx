    "block_comment": "The block of code sets the value of signal Y based on the value of selector signal 'sel'. If 'sel' equals 0 or if it equals none of the defined cases (default), 'Y' is set to 'audio_in'. For 'sel' values 1 to 4, 'Y' is respectively set to 'Y1' to 'Y4'. This is essentially a multiplexer, implemented using Verilog's case statement within an always block, which continuously monitors changes in the 'sel' signal to update 'Y'."
