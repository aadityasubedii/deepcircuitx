    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a FIR filter operation, specifically an impulse response calculation. It works by applying a series of weights 'h' to the input 'Xin' on every positive edge of the clock signal, storing the data in the array 'y'. The first line directly applies the weight to 'Xin' and for subsequent indices, it adds the weighted input to the previous calculation, effectively creating a running sum of weighted inputs which represents the impulse response function."
