    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a finite state machine (FSM) for an audio system that supports play and recording functionalities. It works by transitioning between different states depending on the set conditions. Starting from the `st_start` state, the FSM checks for `pause`, `play`, and `record` inputs in the `st_input_check` state. If `play` is high, it goes to `st_pl_audio_wait` state, and if `record` is high, it goes to `st_rc_audio_wait` state. In `st_rc_audio_wait`, if an audio input is available, it transitions to `st_rc_ram_nextaddr` and then to `st_rc_ram_wait` where it waits for the RAM to be available and then returns to `st_input_check`. In `st_pl_audio_wait`, when an audio output is allowed, it goes to the `st_pl_ram_rd` state, where it reads the RAM when available and valid, and then moves to `st_pl_ram_nextaddr` before returning to `st_input_check`."
