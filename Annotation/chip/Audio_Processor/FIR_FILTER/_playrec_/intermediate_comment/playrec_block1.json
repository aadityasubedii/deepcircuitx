    "block_comment": "This block assigns a Boolean value to `ram_read` based on the comparison of `streg` with `st_pl_ram_rd`. This is done via an 'assign' statement, a continuous assignment statement in Verilog which constantly evaluates the right-hand side expression and assigns it to the left-hand side. Therefore, whenever there's a change in `streg` or `st_pl_ram_rd`, `ram_read` will immediately reflect this change. This block essentially checks if the system state (`streg`) is equal to the state when there's a RAM read operation (`st_pl_ram_rd`), hence signaling a RAM read when true."
