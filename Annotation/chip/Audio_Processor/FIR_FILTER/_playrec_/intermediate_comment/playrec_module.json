    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'playrec' module is a complex audio processor that can record, playback, pause, and filter audio signals. It uses a clock signal to regulate operations and communicates with a RAM for audio data storage. Input and output audio are controlled using dedicated signals. The input audio can be passed through one of four filters or directly, based on a selection input. Operation modes (playing, recording, pausing) and their sequence are controlled by a state machine steered by a clocked process and multiple control signals. Each filter operation is individually defined within its named module."
