    "block_comment": "This block reads an audio input. It performs this function by means of an assignment operation that checks two conditions; if the `streg` equals `st_rc_ram_nextaddr` or if `streg` equals `st_start` with `audio_in_available`. This implementation suggests the block serves as a control structure for audio input acquisition in certain states."
