Module name: playrec. 

Module specification: The 'playrec' module serves as an audio player and recorder with added functionalities of filtering based on a selection process. It primarily manipulates audio signals, interfacing with RAM for storage and retrieval of data, and accommodates operations like playing, recording and pausing. Input ports include the 'CLOCK_50' clock signal, reset command, audio_in for input audio signal, audio_out_allowed and audio_in_available signals to validate operations, play, record and pause commands to control operations, speed for play speed, sel to select a filter, and ram_data_out, ram_valid and ram_waitrq for interfacing with RAM. Output ports include ram_addr for RAM address, ram_data_in as a data bus to RAM, ram_read and ram_write for RAM control signals, audio_out for output audio signal, and write_audio_out and read_audio_in for controlling audio input and output operations. 

Internal signals are used to control filter outputs, control selection, and regulate state-machine-based operations. Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4 are outputs from individual filters, Y decides between filtered/unfiltered audio signals based on 'sel', st and streg govern the state of the system's operational flow. 

The code can be divided into distinct sections for clarity. Filter definition blocks (filter1 - filter4) initialize and apply distinct digital filters on the input audio. The selection case block, based on sel input, chooses between the original and filtered audio signals. The state-machine-based block defines and controls the flow of state transitions for different operations (play, record, pause). The always block uses the streg signal to decide next steps based on current state, the outcome of which decides RAM and audio operations. The synchronous blocks control RAM address and states on clock signal's positive edge, and conditional assign blocks govern the flow of data between RAM, audio and the system. These blocks collectively enable 'playrec' to function as an audio processing system with versatility to filter, record, play and control speed dynamically.
