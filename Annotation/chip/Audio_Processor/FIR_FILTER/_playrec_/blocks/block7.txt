The block is responsible for the address updating of a RAM module. It deploys an always block to update 'ram_addr' at the positive edge of a clock signal (CLOCK_50). If a reset signal is asserted, 'ram_addr' would be set to 0. Otherwise, depending on the state 'streg', it either starts from 0 (st_start) or increments 'ram_addr' (st_rc_ram_nextaddr and st_pl_ram_nextaddr), with st_pl_ram_nextaddr having an extra 'speed' factor in the increment value.
