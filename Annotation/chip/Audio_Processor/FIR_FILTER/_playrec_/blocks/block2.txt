Comment: 
The code block appears to assign a boolean value to the signal `ram_write` depending on whether `streg` is equal to `st_rc_ram_wait`. If `streg` equals `st_rc_ram_wait`, then `ram_write` is assigned with a 'true' logic value (or 1), indicating that a RAM write process should be carried out. If the condition doesn't hold, `ram_write` is assigned a 'false' logic value (or 0), implying no writing process to be conducted. This functionality is achieved by an equality comparison and conditional statement in Verilog.
