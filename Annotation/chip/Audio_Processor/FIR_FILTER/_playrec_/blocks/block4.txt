Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code connects the data input 'Y' to 'ram_data_in', an input port within the RAM component. This assignment is binding, meaning that whenever the value of 'Y' changes, 'ram_data_in' will be updated accordingly in the next simulation timestep. This is part of how a RAM (Random Access Memory) module works, it takes an input data whenever a new write operation is commanded.
