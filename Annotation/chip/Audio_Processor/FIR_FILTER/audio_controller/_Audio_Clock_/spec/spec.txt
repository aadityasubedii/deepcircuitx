Module name: Audio_Clock. 

Module specification: The Audio_Clock is a hardware module defined in Verilog RTL, which uses the Altera Phase Locked Loop (PLL) component (altpll) to generate a stable frequency clock signal specifically configured for an audio system on a Cyclone II FPGA device family. The module utilizes two input ports, 'areset' and 'inclk0'. 'areset' allows to reset the entire module, and 'inclk0' is the original input clock signal processed by the PLL block. It has two output ports, 'c0' and 'locked'. 'c0' is the processed output clock signal by the PLL locked to the input clock with adjustments as defined by the parameters of the PLL. 'locked' is a boolean signal indicating the successful lock status of the PLL to the input clock signal. Internally, the module uses several wires such as 'sub_wire0' to 'sub_wire5' for handling the PLL operations like frequency synthesis, phase alignment and supplying the resulting clock signal to the output. The code is organized into several blocks, with the main block being the instantiation and configuration of the 'altpll' component to achieve the desired clock signal output. The module is also equipped with default system configurations that are addressed through 'defparam' statements.
