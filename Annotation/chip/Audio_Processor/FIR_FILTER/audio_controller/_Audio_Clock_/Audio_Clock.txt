Module-level comment: The Audio_Clock module utilizes an Altera Phase Locked Loop component for generating a stable frequency clock signal for an audio system on Cyclone II FPGA. It receives an input clock and a reset signal, processes them via the PLL, which is further configured using defparams, and provides an output clock and a lock indicator. Internally, the module implements wired connections for the necessary signal manipulations to attain the desired processed clock signal.
