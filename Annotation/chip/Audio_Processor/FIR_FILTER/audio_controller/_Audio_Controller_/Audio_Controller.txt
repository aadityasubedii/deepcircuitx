Module-level comment: This Audio_Controller module primarily controls the audio pipeline. It orchestrates operations such as reading from audio input devices, processing (including serialization/deserialization), and outputting to audio output devices. The module utilizes input, output, and bidirectional ports to interface with ADCs, DACs, I2C, and handle synchronization tasks and left/right audio channel. The module uses internal signals for edge detection, synchronization, and maintaining state. It comprises sub-modules for edge detection, serialization/deserialization, and configuration. Its always blocks, assign statement, and parameters enable state management and configuration control.
