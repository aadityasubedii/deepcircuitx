    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning tristate (high impedance 'Z') state to three output control signals in an audio subsystem: AUD_BCLK, AUD_ADCLRCK, and AUD_DACLRCK. By setting each of these signals to 'Z' (high impedance), the code effectively disconnects the audio subsystem's control signals from the rest of the hardware circuitry. This is used when the audio subsystem is not in active use, to avoid interference with other parts of the hardware system."
