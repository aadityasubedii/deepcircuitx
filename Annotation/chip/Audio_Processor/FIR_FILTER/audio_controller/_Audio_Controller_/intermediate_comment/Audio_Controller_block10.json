    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the output permissions for an audio device. It operates synchronously, being triggered by a positive edge clock signal. When a reset signal is detected, the block disables audio output by setting 'audio_out_allowed' flag to zero. In the absence of a reset signal but presence of adequate write space in either of the highest two slots of left and right audio channels, it allows audio output by setting 'audio_out_allowed' to one. In all other conditions, it disables audio output."
