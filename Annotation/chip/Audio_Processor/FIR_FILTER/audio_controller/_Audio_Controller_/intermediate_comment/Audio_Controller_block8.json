    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code essentially acts as a synchronous reset controller for a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) channel sync operation. The execution is governed by a clock signal, where a rising edge triggers the process. If the reset signal is active high, the \"done_dac_channel_sync\" signal is reset to 0. Alternatively, if the reset signal is not active and there is a falling edge detected on the \"dac_lrclk\" signal, the \"done_dac_channel_sync\" flag is set high signifying that the DAC channel synchronization is complete."
