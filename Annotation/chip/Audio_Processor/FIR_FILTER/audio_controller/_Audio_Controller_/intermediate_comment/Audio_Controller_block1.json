    "block_comment": "The block of code represents an instantiation of the module \"Audio_and_Video_Config\" in Verilog, used for configuring audio and video features. This module connects to the primary clock, reset signal and it drives or monitors various off-chip signals such as address, byteenable, chipselect, read, write commands and the data to write into external devices. It also connects to a two-wire interface (I2C_SDAT and I2C_SCLK), for serial communication. Read data and wait request from the external device are also captured to ensure synchronization and data integrity."
