    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for synchronous resetting and setting of the 'done_adc_channel_sync' signal in accordance with the 'reset' and 'adc_lrclk_rising_edge' signals. When the rising edge of the 'clk' signal is detected, the block checks if 'reset' is high, in which case 'done_adc_channel_sync' is set to low, or if 'adc_lrclk_rising_edge' is high, then 'done_adc_channel_sync' is set to high. This flip-flop structure ensures the 'done_adc_channel_sync' follows both the 'reset' and 'adc_lrclk_rising_edge' conditions under the 'clk' timing pulse."
