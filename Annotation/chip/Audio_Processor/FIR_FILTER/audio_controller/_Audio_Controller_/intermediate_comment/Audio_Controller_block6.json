    "block_comment": "The block instantiates the Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module, which is used for generating rising and falling clock edge signals. It takes in the system clock (clk), a reset signal (reset), and a test clock signal (AUD_BCLK), and outputs the rising edge (bclk_rising_edge) and falling edge (bclk_falling_edge) of the test clock. This is achieved by leveraging the inbuilt functions of the Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module to generate the required edge detection signals."
