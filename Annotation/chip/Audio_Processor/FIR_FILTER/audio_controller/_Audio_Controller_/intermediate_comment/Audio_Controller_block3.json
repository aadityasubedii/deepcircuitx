    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines an instance of an Audio In Deserializer used in a digital audio application. The deserializer interface is managed through multiple inputs and outputs. It synchronizes the incoming data stream with appropriate clock signals, detecting on both rising and falling edges. The module takes in serial digital audio input and flags when synchronized channels are available. On enabling read controls for both left and right audio data, it checks for adequate read space in the FIFO buffers and accordingly writes data into the left and right channels. Proper synchronization and appropriate memory management are crucial for its operation."
