    "block_comment": "This block manages the availability status of the audio input signal in the device. The block gets triggered at every positive edge of the clock. If a reset flag is high, the system acknowledges no audio input available. However, when the reset is not active, the block checks the availability of read data from both left and right audio channels. If either of the 7th or 6th bits of each channel's read availability registers are set, the block sets the signal \"audio_in_available\" high indicating audio input available. If these conditions are not met, the system acknowledges no audio input available."
