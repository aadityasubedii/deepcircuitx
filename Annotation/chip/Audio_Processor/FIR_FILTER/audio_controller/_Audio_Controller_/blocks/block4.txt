The block is a module instantiation of the Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module that is used to detect the rising and falling edges of the Audio Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) left-right clock (AUD_DACLRCK). It takes a system clock signal (clk) and a reset signal as inputs, along with the Audio DAC left-right clock signal (test_clk). If these inputs indicate a rising or falling edge on the DAC left-right clock, the corresponding output (rising_edge or falling_edge) is set accordingly. This block allows the system to respond to changes in the AUD_DACLRCK signal, ensuring correct timing for the processing of stereo audio signals.
