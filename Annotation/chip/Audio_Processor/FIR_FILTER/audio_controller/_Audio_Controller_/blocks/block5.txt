This block of Verilog code implements a rising and falling edge detector for the ADC left-right clock. Utilizing Altera's universal programmable ("UP") clock edge detector module, this block identifies when the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) left-right clock signal (`AUD_ADCLRCK`) experiences a rising edge or a falling edge. The detected edges are then outputted as `adc_lrclk_rising_edge` and `adc_lrclk_falling_edge` respectively. The module operates synchronously, driven by `clk` as the system clock and reset by `reset` for initialization or error recovery purposes.
