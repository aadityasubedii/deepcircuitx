Module name: Audio_Controller. 

Module specification: The Audio_Controller module is a hardware module designed to control an audio pipeline. It is responsible for reading input from audio input devices like microphones, storing this audio data in memory, processing it (which includes serializing and deserializing), and then outputting it to an audio output device like a speaker. The module is also in charge of clock edge detection, left-right data transmission, and interfaces with both input and output devices. Synchronization and memory management tasks are also under its purview.

The module uses multiple input ports which includes a clock signal (clk), reset signal, signals to clear audio input and output memories, signals for data and permission of left and right audio channel outputs, ADC data (AUD_ADCDAT), Bit and Left-Right Clock signals for ADC/DAC (AUD_BCLK, AUD_ADCLRCK, AUD_DACLRCK), and data line for the I2C communication (I2C_SDAT). As for the output ports, the module includes a signal to indicate when audio input is available and when sending audio output is allowed, signals carrying the data for the left and right audio channel inputs, signals for the master clock, data to DAC and the clock line for I2C communication (AUD_XCK, AUD_DACDAT, I2C_SCLK) also, it has bidirectional ports such as (AUD_BCLK, AUD_ADCLRCK, AUD_DACLRCK, I2C_SDAT).

The module uses numerous internal signals. These are primarily utilized for detecting rising and falling edges of the ADC/DAC bit clocks and ADC/DAC Left-Right clocks (e.g., `bclk_rising_edge`, `bclk_falling_edge`), providing information about the availability of audio input and write space in the FIFO buffer associated with audio channels (e.g., 'left_channel_read_available', 'right_channel_write_space') and signals that indicate the synchronization of ADC and DAC channels (e.g., `done_adc_channel_sync`, `done_dac_channel_sync`).

In its structure, the Audio_Controller module encapsulates multiple sub-blocks: `Altera_UP_Clock_Edge` for detecting edge changes in audio clocks, `Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer` for converting serial audio input data into parallel form, `Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer` for converting parallel audio output data into serial form, and `Audio_and_Video_Config` for handling the configuration of audio and video signals. Each of these blocks has a distinct role within the controller contributing to its overall function of managing the audio pipeline. The module parameters and local parameters are used to specify configuration such as audio data width and bit counter initial value. The module uses sequential logic (inside always blocks) to manage states like audio_in_available, audio_out_allowed, done_adc_channel_sync and done_dac_channel_sync. The assign statement is used to control the bidirectional signals AUD_BCLK, AUD_ADCLRCK, AUD_DACLRCK. Overall, these elements contribute to the module's ultimate responsibility of reading from, processing, and writing to the audio pipeline.
