Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer. 

Module specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer is a module designed for the deserialization and synchronization of incoming digital audio data. This specialized unit provides interfaces that allow the reading of data that aids in audio data processing. It consists of two in-built synchronous First In First Out FIFO entities for separately storing left and right channel audio data. 

The module utilizes multiple input and output ports, each performing unique functions. The input ports include 'clk' for synchronization, 'reset' for system initialization, 'bit_clk_rising_edge' and 'bit_clk_falling_edge' for tracking bit clock changes, 'left_right_clk_rising_edge' and 'left_right_clk_falling_edge' for left and right channel synchronization, 'done_channel_sync' for channel synchronization completion, 'serial_audio_in_data' for the incoming serialized audio data, and 'read_left_audio_data_en' and 'read_right_audio_data_en' enabling data reading from the left and right channels respectively.

The output ports consist of 'left_audio_fifo_read_space' and 'right_audio_fifo_read_space' for monitoring the available space for sampled data in the FIFOs, ‘left_channel_data’, and ‘right_channel_data’ outputting the deserialized audio data of left and right channels.

Internally, this module uses a series of signals for monitoring and controlling various actions. For instance, 'AUDIO_DATA_WIDTH' defines the bit-width of the audio data, 'BIT_COUNTER_INIT' is an initializer for the bit counter, 'valid_audio_input' indicates a valid audio input, and signals like 'left_channel_fifo_is_full' and 'left_channel_fifo_is_empty' signify the status of FIFOs. The data is processed through a data shift register, 'data_in_shift_reg'.

The module is structured into different code blocks. The 'Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter' block is responsible for audio bit counting and helps separate the data for different channels. The 'Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO' blocks are used for FIFO memory in both left and right channels. These blocks write data into FIFOs when there is space available and read data from FIFOs when available. Configurations of data width and depth for FIFOs are also declared here. The module takes serial digital audio data, deserializes, and separates it into left and right channels, and outputs the data with indicators showing remaining FIFO spaces of both channels.
