This module provides interfaces to enable reading data enabling audio data processing. It uses two synchronous FIFOs (First In First Out) to separately store left and right audio data. The bit stream is clocked into a shift register, the audio bit counter module keeps track of the incoming bit stream and produces a control signal to differentiate left channel data from right channel data. Data is read from the FIFOs based on reading-enable signals. Reading spaces for both FIFOs are also provided. This module can be reset using a reset signal."
